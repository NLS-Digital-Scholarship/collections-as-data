No. 3111/145 Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, in the General Department, dated Pachmarhi, the 24th June 1887. READ letter No 754 L. A., dated the 20th May 1887, from the Deputy-Surgeon General, Central Provinces, forwarding for submission to the Chief Commissioner the Annual Reports and .Statements of the Nagpur and Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylums for the year 1886. READ also the Reports and Statements of the Superintendents of the Asylums. RESOLUTION. Population statistics of the two Asylums. On the 1st January 1886 there were 165 inmates (132 males and 33 females) in the Nagpur Asylum: there were 29 patients admitted (26 males and 3 females), so that the total popula- tion was 194 (158 males and 36 females). Eleven patients (all males) were discharged cured, and one was discharged improved: one female was discharged not improved, and seven males are shown as discharged otherwise than as "cured" or " transferred to friends.'' Twenty-three patients died (16 males and 7 females). The population on the last day of the year was 151 (123 males and 28 females). The daily average strength was 160.29, and the daily average sick 14.87. The percentage of deaths on admissions was 233? per cent among the female, and 61½ per cent among the male, patients. In the Jubbulpore Asylum there were on the 1st January 1886, 134 inmates (103 males and 31 females). Twelve males and two females were admitted, so that the total population was 148 (115 males and 33 females). Four males were discharged cured, and 10 patients (6 males and 4 females) died. The population at the end of the year was 134 (105 males and 29 females). The daily average strength was 133.39, and the daily average sick 2.61. The percentage of deaths on admissions was 200 among the female, and 50 among the male, patients. Admissions and discharges. 2. The number of admissions from the Central Provinces into the Nagpur Asylum, which rose from 27 in 1884 to 38 in 1885, has fallen to 23 in the year under report. The Deputy Surgeon General is unable to give any explanation of these fluctuations. It is noticeable that for the first time for the last eleven years there have been no re-admis- sions into either Asylum. This is no doubt due to greater care in discharging patients as improved. Only one such discharge was made from the Nagpur Asylum and none from the Jubbulpore Asylum in 1886. Of the seven male patients shown as discharged from the Nagpur Asylum otherwise than as "cured" or " transferred to friends," four'escaped. No fewer than 9 lunatics made their escape during the year from this Asylum: of these, 5 were at once re-cap- tured. The Superintendent remarks that of the other four who were successful in their attempts, " the escape of one of the four only is a cause for regret." This may be so: but it is obvious that this is only a fortunate accident, and the four fugitives might have been the most dangerous patients in the Asylum. It is not satisfactory to find that so many escapes were possible.
2 Separate confinement of dangerous lunatics. 3. Closely connected with this matter is the question of confining dan gerous lunatics within an enclosure which has been under the consideration of the Chief Commissioner during the year. Dr. Rice's remarks on this point are clear and forcible. The real distinction lies not necessarily between criminal and non- criminal but between dangerous and harmless lunatics. The former is merely a technical distinction. What the Chief Commissioner desires to ensure is that lunatics who, whether they be criminal or not, are subject to paroxysms of homicidal mania, should be put under such restraint as to minimize the risk to their fellow-patients as well as to the outside public. Dr. Rice is apparenty right in remarking that this can be secured only by locking up the dangerous lunatics who are actively violent in separate cells and by keeping in a separate enclosure "those who are considered liable to sudden out-bursts of violence." The excellence of Dr. Rice's practice is avouched by the fact that since the Jubbulpore Asylum has been open, no fatal assault has been committed by any lunatic, and only two assaults that deserve to be called serious3 The mortality at Nagpur was twice as great as in 1885 and greater than it has been since 1874 : at Jubbulpore it was higher than it has been in any of the previous 10 years. Dysentery and diarrhNo. 764 L. A. FROM JAMES H. LOCH, ESQ., M. D., DEPUTY SURGEON-GENERAL, Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces, Dated Nagpur, the 20th May 1887. SIR, I have the honour to forward for submission to the Chief Commis- sioner the Annual Reports and Statements of the Nagpur and Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylums for the year 1886. 2.At Nagpur 8 cells for male patients and a house for wheat grinding in the women's enclosure have been built by the Public Works Department, while the improvements in the grounds continue to be carried out by the inmates. The building of the house for wheat grinding meets a much felt want, as until its erection the wheat had to be ground in part of a dormitory. At Jubbul- pore the dilapidated and unsightly wooden palings have been replaced by iron railings, and the reservoir water was brought inside the asylum. 3. The admissions at Nagpur were very much fewer than in 1885, while at Jubbulpore they were only 1 less. The number discharged from the Nagpur Asylum was also less (by ¼) than in 1885, and the number from the Jubbulpore Asylum was only half of what it was in the previous year. With reference to the remark by Dr. Rice that the smaller number of admissions at Jubbulpore is due to supposed luna- tics being subjected to a longer period of observation than formerly before admission to the Asylum, I find that of 9 such persons reported on at Jubbul- pore only 5 were declared insane and sent to the Asylum, while at Nagpur of the same number 8 were reported insane. I have not any explanation to offer of the unusually large number of admissions at Nagpur in 1885 or the much smaller number in 1886. The daily average strength was practically the same for the two past years at both the Asylums. 4. There was not any over-crowding at either of the Asylums, but at Nagpur the number of inmates on one or more days reached to within 9 (4 for males and 5 for females) of the full number that can be accommodated in the Asylum. 5. At both Nagpur and Jubbulpore the percentage of cured to daily average strength was rather less than in 1885. The following table shows that in 1885. as in previous years the percentage of cures in the Asylums of the Central Provinces is considerably less than that returned by Asylums of
2 other Provinces. I would add, with reference to this table and to the remark in your letter No. 4993-A,3 patients. The daily average strength of the criminal population of the two asylums did not differ to any marked extent from that of 1885, but while it was slightly lower at Nagpur it was higher at Jubbulpore. STATEMENT III. 10. The "residence" given in this table is, at least in the case of the Nagpur Asylum, the district from which the lunatic was received; but in many cases this is not the previous place of abode, which I find from an examination of the papers of the 29 patients admitted at Nagpur to be Nagpur ... ... 11 Raipur ... ... 2 Bhandara ... ... 3 Jubbulpore ... ... 1 Chanda ... ... 2 Hyderabad Assigned Districts ... 6 Unknown or not stated ... 4 Of the 16 admitted from the Nagpur district, 6 were sent in by the Can- tonment Magistrate, Kamptee, and 4 came from the Central Jail. The presence of a Military Cantonment with its strict rules and of a Cen- tral Jail would thus seem to explain partly at least the large number of admis- sions from the Nagpur district. STATEMENT IV. 11. Does not call for any remark. STATEMENT V. 12. Presents nothing unusual or worthy of note. STATEMENT VI. 13. As in previous years the large majority of the lunatics admitted at Nagpur were suffering from acute mania or acute dementia, and at Jubbulpore from acute mania. The proportion of cases of melancholia is larger, and of acute dementia smaller, at Jubbulpore than at Nagpur. I made a careful exam- ination during the year of each case in the asylums, with a view to discover- ing if it were possible to bring the classification of the two institutions more into unison. In by far the greater number of the cases I had no difficulty in accepting the type entered by the Superintendent as correct, but at each insti- tution there were a few cases that I would have entered under a different type from that under which the Superintendent had classed them; in these, however, the symptoms were not sufficiently distinct to justify my setting aside the diag- nosis of the Superintendents, formed after a lengthened observation of the patients. On taking out the percentages (on total patients) in the two asylums of each type of insanity for the past and the previous 5 years, I find that the dif- ferences are much less than they were, and that in the case of acute mania, melancholia and acute dementia the difference does not in any exceed 2.4 per cent in either 1885 or 1886.
4 STATEMENT VII. 14. Ganja smoking was very markedly the most common cause, as far as it could be ascertained, of the insanity of the patients admitted in 1886. STATEMENT VIII. 15. The daily average sick at both the Asylums is considerably larger than for several years past: at Nagpur the ratio is higher than in any of the previous 10 years, and at Jubbulpore it has not been so high since 1881. There is the same difference in the ratio of sick in the two Asylums, as has existed in former years, the ratio percentage of average daily strength being5 The table inserted below shows that in spite of the increase of sickness during the year in the asylums, the ratios for the Central Provinces institutions do not compare very unfavorably with those of the asylums of other Provinces, but the rate of mortality is higher than that of any of the others. TABLE II. Province. Year. Per- cent- age of sick to strength. Per- cent- age of death to strength. Percentage of total deaths from Fever. Dysen- tery. Diarr- h6 (4.) The higher cost of contingencies is chiefly due to a difference in the heading under which articles are included in the bills of the two asylums. (5.) Europe medicines cost more at Nagpur because the Superintendent entered the sum which the Comptroller charged to the institution under the rules in force, while Doctor Rice appears to have debited the asylum with the value of the drugs actually received: if the same course had been followed at Nagpur the cost for medicines per head would have been only Rs. 0-9-4 instead of Rs. 1-1-9. The total cost per head at Nagpur was Rs. 3-3-1 less in 1886 than in 1885, the decrease being due to the cheaper price of food grains by which the cost per head for this item was reduced by Rs. 4-15-0. Establishment also cost rather less. On the other hand, clothing, contingencies, repairs and Europe medicines each cost more than in 1886, but, as already said, the sum entered under the last heading is more than the real cost. At Jubbulpore each patient cost Rs. 5-5-1 more in 1886 than in 1885, in consequence chiefly of the dearness of food which raised the cost per head for diet by Rs, 4-14-10. There was also an increase in the cost of contingencies. The following table gives the average cost per head for each item of expendi- ture in the asylums of the Central Provinces and in those of other Provinces, and shows that with the exception of superintendence (the cost per head of which depends on the number of patients), the charges in the asylums of the Central Provinces compare very favorably with those in the institutions of other Provinces and that the total cost per head in the Central Provinces, both for the previous 5 years and for 1886, is lower than elsewhere :7 As compared with those of 1885 the profits at both Asylums have increased, the increase being much larger at Nagpur than at Jubbulpore. The net profits were:9 Report on the Nagpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1886. A row of eight cells for male patients was built by the Department Public Works, they are suitable and secure. A room for wheat grinding was construct- ed at small cost in the female enclosure, the cross walls and the foundation of one long wall of other buildings having been utilized for the purpose: formerly wheat for the entire asylum was ground in one of the dormitories, this is now remedied. The female wards and enclosure with the out-offices as cells, grind- ing room and latrine are now complete, in excellent order, and will require no more alterations or additions. 2. Tidying of the environs still goes on; the lunatics have done much to make the place trim during the year, but they are very capricious, and as hard toil is in no case exacted, the work judged by the number employed may seem trifling in quantity, still it is I think fair; there was much to be done and a good deal still remains to be carried out. The more hardy are employed on farming and on gardening, which they seem to like and understand; they are not pressed at work yet they perform the whole of the out door-labour : many of them belong to the agricultural classes. A few additions and alterations as keepers' quarters, remodelling the Deputy Superintendent's house, and another latrine for males are still required with some minor works to make wards secure. STATEMENT I. 3. It is very difficult to account for the large number of admissions dur- ing the past two years, viz. 46 and 29 ; nor is it easy to state the cause of the difference between the admissions in both years, viz. 17. No clue is given in the papers sent in by Magistrates with lunatics nor does the condition of the patients throw light on it, and so I refrain from offering an opinion on the subject. All admissions of the year except one were proper subjects for an asylum, the exception being an epileptic and not an insane; he was soon released. For the first time during the eleven years shown in this return there were no re-admissions; only one was registered in 1885 : this would indicate care and caution in ordering releases in previous years. During that under report twenty left the asylum or10 5. One case of chronic mania improved and was made over to his mother, after a residence of three months; and the lunatic who was discharged no better was a feeble old woman whose friends satisfied the visitors and the Magistrate that she would he taken care of outside; she never ceased crying in the asylum. 6. Of the 7 discharged otherwise, six were admitted on account of acute mania and one from chronic dementia, they are thus accounted for: two were reported fit to stand their trial and were sent to Berar for this purpose, one was cured and sent back to jail to complete his sentence, and four escaped. Of these four, three were admitted for acute mania, two of them were very violent on admission, they soon recovered and would have been brought up for release at the next meeting of visitors, but finding themselves in an asylum on reason returning they escaped. One was a Kaikari, thug or dacoit sent from Hyderabad; he got away by climbing over the wall, having recovered his reason. The fourth had been in the asylum for twelve years, suffering from dementia, he also would have been discharged if his friends could be dis- covered, there was not much improvement in his mental condition, which was that of a harmless lunatic; he was employed on the farm and wandered away. Thus the escape of one of the four only is a cause for regret. 7. Twenty-three died or more than double the mortality of the previous year and approaching very closely that of 1874 which stood at 16.28 per cent of average strength, whilst that of the year under report stood at 14.34. 8. Looking back to the records of the year 1874 I find that Dr. Beatson, the Superintendent, attributed the heavy mortality to (a) bad health or advan- ced age on admission ; (b) accumulation of elderly patients ; and (c) prevalence of bowel disease: and these causes were also in operation in 1886. Of the total, 14 died from bowel disease, and of these four were in broken down health on admission, creatures beyond hope of recovery. Eight had been from eleven to twenty-two years in the asylum, six of these being over fifty years of age : two died worn out from leprosy ; one expired during a severe epileptic attack ; one committed suicide ; one died from an11 STATEMENT III. 11. Nagpur and Kamptee sent in more than half the admissions ; it may be that the police there are more keenly alive to the necessity for sending such people up than the rural police, or it may be that a larger num- ber are to be found in large centres than elsewhere. STATEMENT VI. 12. The differences in the types of insanity as returned by both asylums in former years have been noticed in the Chief Commissioner's reviews on their working, and again in paragraph 5 of the review on the reports for 1885. The Deputy Surgeon-General therefore visited this asylum in 1886 when every lunatic there was separately brought before him and their cases and histories read out : the result of this minute and lengthy examination was that whilst the diagnosis in three or four cases was considered open to doubt, in none was the type changed. Except in those unmistakeable cases of acute mania the type is not registered until the lunatic has been some time in the asylum under observation, the lunatic's history is then considered with reference to known rules of classification aided by the principles laid down for guidance in such standard works as that by Bucknill and Tuke. No little care is taken in determining the classification, but it must be remembered that the symptoms of types in some cases are so indistinct that even specialists may differ regard- ing diagnosis. The following alterations were made in the classification of the remaining of the previous year: two males and one female were changed from acute to chronic mania, one male from chronic mania to chronic dementia, and one from chronic mania to melancholia. 13. As during the previous year acute mania and acute dementia formed the majority of the admissions or 24 out of 29: the first class contained some very violent lunatics ; thus a priest's chela followed his superior to Nagpur where they separated ; the young man gave himself up to dissipation including ganja and was brought in so violent that it was difficult to do any thing with him : food, medicine, clothing, every thing was spurned in the most savage manner, yet he rapidly recovered and escaped three months afterwards. In trying to account for the large number of acute as against chronic cases, melancholia and so forth, it may be that the majority of those suffering from. the latter forms and who are either friendless or so troublesome as to warrant their being sent to an asylum have already been sent there, whereas all acute cases would naturally be sent in at once. STATEMENT IX. 14. Receipts from the Treasury were less than in 1885, cheaper provi- sions and fewer patients caused this. Public Works charges which appear in column 4 were also less : the item Rs. 5,740-0-4 is made up thus : 12 The amount set against medicine is the sum intimated by the Comptroller as the proportion of the cost of drugs supplied from Provincial funds to be borne by the Asylum under the orders of Government; the actual value of drugs received however was only Rs. 93, the cost of drugs set against the Civil station, the Police and the Asylum under these orders falls in the case of Nagpur very unequally ; perhaps the matter would bear looking into and re-consideration. Diet cost Rs. 26-11-3 per head or Rs. 4-12-8 less than during the pre- vious year, due to cheaper prices : supplies are bought in the open market, which is the most favourable method of purchase. The farm produced larger returns in 1886, and the net profit stands at Rs. 677-13-9 as against Rs. 498-1-10. NAGPUR: J. F. BARTER, Brigade-Surgeon, April 1st, 1887. Superintendent Lunatic Asylum.
13 Annual Report on the Lunatic Asylum, Jubbulpore, for the year 1886. As usual this report will take the shape of brief comments on each of the twelve Statistical tables submitted. STATEMENT I. Shows that 134 males 103/female 31 remained at the beginning of the year : 14 males 12/female 2 were admitted, making a total of 148 males115 /females 33. Of these, 4 males were discharged cured, 10 males 6/female 4 died, leaving 134 males 105/female 29 under treatment at the end of the year. "With the exception of the increased mortality, the figures are almost exactly the same as in the preceding year. Of the 14 admissions, 6 were criminal lunatics in whose cases we have no option, leaving 3 as the number ordinarily admitted as "non-criminal" luna- tics : this is very much less than the admissions of the previous years, and would point to the advantage of detaining lunatics for some time under obser- vation before sending them to the asylum. The four discharged "cured" all suffered from acute mania, the form of in- sanity most amenable to treatment. Two of them were a little over three years in the asylum, one six months, and the fourth a little over two months : there have been no relapses up to this : one is keeping a shop at Murwara : another is driving a hackney carriage: a third is serving with his regiment, and the fourth has gone to Chirkari in Bundelkund, and we hear he keeps quite well. Of course if the admission of patients is restricted as described in last year's report, and their discharge allowed only after mature deliberation on the part of the official visitors, it is but reasonable that the "cures" must be few. A pauper lunatic's friends are seldom able even if willing to take him to their homes until he is quite well and needs no watching ; this proves a bar to our discharging them under Section X There have been no escapes. The capacity of the Asylum is for 174, but the greatest number on any one day was 137, so there was no crowding. The accommodation though sufficient for our requirements does not admit of the complete separation of criminal from non-criminal lunatics because of the limited area on which the asylum is built. I do not myself see why they should be separated. The necessity is rather to separate the dangerous from the harmless, and this is what is done in this asylum. It can be done with complete safety only by locking up those of the former who are actively violent in separate cells or small wards; and keeping those in a separate compartment who are considered liable to sudden out-bursts of violence. "Criminal" and "dangerous" as applied to insanes are not necessarily convertible terms : as a matter of fact the proportion of dangerous amongst non-criminal lunatics in this asylum is greater than amongst the criminal class.
14 It is often a mere accident whether a lunatic comes to us under one denomi- nation or the other : it is dependent on the way the case is taken up. We have in the asylum inmates as non-criminal lunatics who stoned people, or hunted women and children, lighted fires near haystacks or houses, or in one way or another were pronounced dangerous : while we have an idiot who must be classed as a criminal lunatic because he was taken up by the police for turning aside in a bazar to answer a call of nature ; when taken up he was found to be "incapable of making his defence, " and in this state he will remain till he dies : in the meantime the visitors don't see their way of getting rid of him. There are lunatics now on the criminal list in the asylum who have proved harmless for a series of years : it is but too probable that they committed the offence with which they are charged while in a state of irritation, from hunger and cold, for "a hungry man is an angry man:" as long as they are well clothed or fed and protected from annoyance they are almost certain to remain harmless. I don't see why they should be locked up in separate rooms, and as I said before this is the only way to secure them if we are to be logical. As a practical proof of the correctness of my views I am able to state that for the twenty-two years that this asylum has been open, assaults have invariably been committed by non-criminal lunatics : I may as well add that only two serious ones occurred during the whole time,15 Of the 6 who were admitted, 3 males 2/female 1 came from Native States within the limits of the Central India Agency. This Administration finds it conve- nient to intern its lunatics in the Jubbulpore Asylum where they are received with the consent of the Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces on the understanding that the Governor-General's Agent makes arrangement for the payment of all expenses incurred in their care and maintenance. There are now 4 such patients: we have treated altogether 7 individuals from those terri- tories during recent years. STATEMENT III. Of the 14 admitted, 13 were Hindus and 1 a Mussulman : 3 came from the Jubbulpore district, 2 from the Central Jail, and 1 each from the localities named in the list. There is nothing more calling for remark. STATEMENTS IV. AND V. Do not require any comments: they explain themselves. STATEMENTS VI. AND VII. Had best be discussed together. It is necessary to deal with the types of insanity for this year's admissions only : those of the older residents have been discussed in previous reports. 6 males 5/female 1 out of the 14 were suffering from acute, recently developed mania. In three only could any cause be assigned, namely " loss of money," " ganja smoking " and " religious excitement." No cause was assigned or could be ascertained in the other two cases. There was 1 case of chronic mania, cause unknown. Two were admitted for melancholia : in one it was attributed to loss of money, in the other no cause was assigned. Four cases of dementia were admitted: one was a confirmed opium eater, one a ganja smoker: in the other two the cause was returned as unknown. One amentia case was born an idiot, he is also a dummy, he was sent to the asylum because he is mischievous and dangerous: he pelts people with stones, damages houses and other property, and in various ways is an intoler- able nuisance : his friends are too poor to manage him : he comes under the class of non-criminal lunatics, Since he has been in the asylum he keeps quite harmless. I do not experience any difficulty in diagnosing the variety of the disease in the few cases admitted during the year : although in many the symptoms are assignable to more than one type, there are always certain characteristic features, which after a little watching are discovered and enable us to distin- guish the form of insanity under which the patient is suffering. It is seldom that a patient by his own demeanour does not in time clear up a doubt ; it is always safest to wait.
16 The weak point in our asylum management is the inability to assign a cause for each case of insanity, The difficulties in this connection have been discussed in former reports and are well recognised. What happens to us is that the " previous history" column in the patient's case sheet is too often blank: and in the cause column the word " unknown" is entered. Sometimes in a lucid interval the patient tells his own story and from this we are at times able to discover a fairly reasonable cause: but it is not difficult to conceive how seldem it is that this can happen. STATEMENT VIII. Deals with bodily sickness. There were 59 admissions into Hospital, against 44 for the year preceding. They were spread over a variety of diseases: but "fevers" as usual head the list, embracing 20 cases or over a third of the whole, next come " abscess and ulcers" with 6 cases. There were 5 cases of "dyspepsia" and 1 each of "colic" and "constipation ;" but strange to say there is no record of any case of "diarrh17 from the effects of which she died: 1 died of general dropsy, the result of com- bined renal and cardial disease :1 died in an epileptic fit: 1 died of pneumonia, and 1 very old woman dropped dead from sheer old age. All the foregoing were old residents in the asylum and more or less advanced in years. The tenth was a case of valvular disease of the heart, he was an inmate of only 19 months' standing. STATEMENT IX. Is the Cash Account. The receipts from the treasury amounted to Rs. 8,305 against Rs. 7,670 for the year preceding, showing an increase of Rs. 635. This was due18 The average cost per head rose in consequence from Rs. 60 to Rs. 65.

The marked difference in the comparative healthiness of the two asylums still continues, though in respect of admissions to hospital, Nagpur showed an improvement and Jubbulpore a falling off as compared with the previous year, the percentage of sick to average daily strength being :3 when it only received Rs. 97 worth. The Deputy Surgeon-General should refer the matter for orders. The profits of the patients labour as compared with last year were:No. 640. FROM JAMES H. LOCH, ESQ., M. D., DEPUTY SURGEON-GENERAL, Central Provinces, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 1st May 1888. SIR, I have the honour to forward for submission to the Chief Com- missioner, the Annual Reports and Statements of the Nagpur and Jubhulpore Lunatic Asylums for the year 1887. 2. At neither of the asylums were any new buildings erected, but at Jub- bulpore some improvements were effected; among others a godown was altered so that it is fitted for and is now used as a hospital for the female patients. 3. The admissions to both asylums were in excess of those in 1886, but at neither was the excess large. The number of patients discharged was largely in excess of that in 1886, that at the Nagpur Asylum being the highest of any in the past 10 years and that at Jubbulpore being double what it was the previous year ; out of the 37 patients discharged from the Nagpur Asylum, 28 were actually sent away from the institution. The daily average strength was somewhat lower at Nagpur and very slightly higher at Jubbulpore than in 1886. 4. There was not any approach to overcrowding at any time in either of the asylums, 5. The percentage of cured to daily strength at Nagpur is not only double that of last year but is the highest returned in any of the past 10 years : it is nearly three times higher than that of Jubbulpore where it is about the average of past years. The percentage of cured to admissions is also high at Nagpur, but not so markedly so as is that of cured to daily strength. Among the cured are included 3 patients who showed no signs of in- sanity during their stay in the asylum.
2 This large number of cures at Nagpur has caused the ratio of such for the Central Provinces to approximate more closely to that of other provinces than in former years: the latest figures available to me being as under :3 STATEMENT III. 10. As usual the districts (if we accept the statements in the patients papers) which supplied the largest number of lunatics, are Nagpur and Jub- bulpore. STATEMENT IV. 11. Does not call for any special remark. STATEMENT V. 12. There is not anything unusual as to the ages of the patients admitted. STATEMENT VI. 13. At both the asylums mania was the type of insanity in more than half the patients admitted, but as in former years, while Dr. Barter considered a considerable number of those admitted to be suffering from Dementia, the Superintendent of the Jubbulpore Asylum does not return a case of this type of insanity among the admissions, and enters by far the greater part as labour- ing under acute mania. STATEMENT VII. 14. Of the causes assigned as having brought on the attack of insanity, Ganja is very markedly the most common in the case of the patients admitted to the Nagpur Asylum: but in the case of those admitted at Jubbulpore no one cause is said to have been markedly more common than another. STATEMENT VIII. 15. The average daily sick at Nagpur, though less than in 1886, is higher than in any previous year, except l885 and 1886, and at Jubbulpore it is in excess of that of any of the previous 5 years ; the percentage of sick to daily strength for the two asylums is4 At Jubbulpore the admissions from bowel-complaints, though more than in 1886 which was quite exceptional, are lower than in any other of the previ- ous 13 years. A comparison of the Nagpur Asylum figures for the past 13 years shows, that the percentage of admission for dysentery in 1887 is slightly "below the average, but that if those for last year in which the disease prevailed to an unusual degree be excluded, then the ratio for 1887 is about the average. The ratio of admission for diarrh5 proportion of death due to fever is excessive, but that those from Dysentery and Diarrh6 During the last five months of the year, the full scale of diet of the Nagpur Asylum has been the same as that in use at Jubbulpore, except that at the former 9 chhattacks of atta and 3 of rice are given, in place of 12 chhattacks of atta, which is the scale at Jubbulpore, and in future any difference in the cost of diet will be due chiefly to a difference in the rates at which the articles are purchased. The following table exhibits the comparative cost of each patient in the asylums of different Provinces, and shows that not only as regards the total cost, but that under each head of expenditure, the institutions of the Central Pro- vinces compare favourably with the others :Report on the Lunatic Asylum at Nagpur for 1887. ADDITIONS AND ALTERATIONS. These were few and unimportant; worn out wood bars gave place to new iron ones in the west bungalow, greater security has thus been secured. The bars of barracks one and two were strengthened. A room has been added to the cook house for storing purposes and a new iron sun-shade was fixed over the doors of the female cells for protection from sun and rain, Lunatics continue to improve the environs; indeed the general appearance of the place has been quite changed during the past few years. STATEMENT NO. I. 2. Admissions exceeded those for the previous year by four but were fewer than those for 1885 by thirteen ; they exceeded the average annual number of admissions for the previous ten years (Berar admissions in 1884 excluded) by nine. Of the eight re-admitted four were relapses after intervals of from two to seven years. Of the remaining four two were merely transfers from the criminal to the non-criminal list on expiry of sentence, two were discharged for trial and readmitted. 3. Thirty-seven left the asylum under these conditions ; 21 were cured, the highest number on record; of these 9 suffered from acute mania and recovered after intervals varying from two and half years to two months, the average residence being just under one year. One case of chronic mania was discharged after one year and six months' residence: 7 acute dementia cases were dis- charged after residence varying from two years and five months to four months the average residence being seven months. One very mild case of chronic dementia and 3 cases considered not insane on admission to the asylum were discharged after short residence. 4. Of the 7 shown as improved, two acute mania cases were made over to friends after a residence of nearly six and four months respectively: a case of chronic mania was similarly made over after twenty months residence : and a case of melancholia was similarly disposed of after four months, whilst three cases of chronic dementia were discharged after residence respectively of twelve years and two months. 5. Of the 9 discharged otherwise. two criminal lunatics having recovered were sent to the Central Prison for security, four were sent for trial, one escaped and two were transferred to the non-criminal list on expiry of sentence. 6. Although the daily average number sick was lower than during the previous year, 11.79 as against 14.87, the number of admissions being nearly similar, there has again been heavy mortality; twenty-five died, or 18 per cent of the average strength, the highest on record. Various causes have been sug- gested to account for the heavy mortality here of late, as for instance the man- ner in which the food is cooked, the position of the asylum, farm operations, and so on. I am of opinion that the sickness and mortality that has occurred during the past two years is not owing to any of these causes, but rather to con- ditions inseparable from mental disease, to some of the causes set forth in para-
8 graph 8 of my Report for 1886 and to sickly seasons: thus admissions from fevers numbered 24, 50 and 72 in the three years 1885, 1886 and 1887 respectively, the average strength being 161, 160 and 138. A large increase in fevers treated at the various dispensaries in the Nagpur district has also been registered in 1887, viz. 28 per cent with reference to the previous year, the increase in total treated being 5 per cent only. The cooking arrangements are precisely similar to those in the Central Jails; they are supervised with care, and the fact that only eight cases of bowel disease occurred in 1887 without a fatal result would seem to be opposed to the theory of inferior cooking to which it was suggested the heavy bowel disease of 1886 might be due, 25 admissions and 14 deaths, the cooking arrangements of both years being the same, nor is it possible to feed men forcibly with chappaties, the food to which exception has been taken: food forcibly administered was for the most part fluid or soft, as soup, milk, rice, dal, vegetables, and so on. As regards the position of the asylum I am of opinion that it is one of the best in Nagpur, and with respect to farm labour, which has been suggested as a possible cause, we have the high authority of the late Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India Surgeon-General Cunningham, and the opinions of Surgeons-General Beatson and Townsend, former Superintendents of this asylum, to the effect that this form of employ- ment was most suitable for lunatics: also the fact that only one man who was so employed died during the year under report. This man (No. 18 in the detail of cases here given) a Betul Gond, had been over nineteen years in the asylum, during which period he was employed exclusively on farm work. 7. In paragraph 8 of my Report for 1886 I gave some of the causes of mortality which were in operation during that year. It was considered, however, (Deputy Surgeon-General's covering letter, paragraph 15) that the causes of sickness producing this mortality might have also been explained : although the causes of sickness and of mortality may for practical purposes be said to be synonymous. I give here in short detail the histories of those who died; the cause of sickness may be plainly read in this record, whilst the causes of mor- tality are obvious : there is nothing I think in this short record to show that either the cooking, the site or the labour is at fault. Of the 22 who remained at the close of the year 1886 under treatment 9 died, thus :9 November 1886, fed and physiced with great difficulty; died February 1887 Residence in asylum 11 years and 8 months.

An epileptic and phthisical patient and very filthy in his habits, got bronchitis and diarrhoea, rapidly ran down and died from H12 athough it used to be the custom formerly to visit the asylum twice or three times a week only, I considered that the state of things rendered a daily visit and frequently two visits a day necessary. The first and last of the histories are fairly typical cases. The former was a man of long residence during the whole of which it was necessary to feed him forcibly. It cannot be supposed that during these eleven years of forcible feeding he swallowed sufficient food at each meal, indeed his under-fed appearance showed that he did not: the day of reckoning came when he got dysentery, his want of stamina was soon apparent; recovering from the disease under the usual treatment he become an13 caused the bulk of the admissions and deaths in 1886, fevers and an14 Anuual Report on the Lunatic Asylum, Jubbulpore, for the year 1887. The buildings in the asylum have been kept in repair by the Public Works Department, with the exception of the barrack outside the main enclo- sure, they are all in good order and suitable to the requirements of the inmates. The barrack outside the enclosure will require partial re-roofing before next rainy season, as the bamboo framework on which the tiles are laid is insect eaten and falling to pieces. The old shed in the women's enclosure, used for grinding grain in, has been partially re-built with a new roof, and flagged floor added. The godown in the North-eastern corner of the same enclosure has been re-built, and a verandah added. As it is now much too good for a godown, I have converted it into a hospital for sick females, and it answers this purpose very well. These buildings have cost Rs. 968-4-9. STATEMENT I. There was but little change in the strength of the asylum during the past year, the number remaining on the 1st January was 134 (105 males, 29 females). The average remaining for the past ten years was 131.7, so there has been very little variation. There were 15 admissions (10 males, 5 females) making a total of 149 (115 males, 34 females). Of these 8 (7 males, 1 female) were discharged cured, and 9 (7 males, 2 females) died, leaving 132 (101 males, 31 females) under treatment at the close of the year. There were no re-admissions. Of the 15 admissions 3 (2 males, 1 female) were criminal lunatics. Of the 8 discharged cured, five were cases of acute mania, one chronic mania, one melancholia and one acute dementia; their residence in the asylum varying from 3 months to 3 years. The greatest number confined on any one night was 140 (109 males, 31 females) the capacity of the asylum being for 174, so there was no over- crowding. The daily average strength was 135.75 compared with 133.39 in the preceding year. This was an increase of 2.36. As has been stated before there is no separation of criminal from non-criminal lunatics, they are divided according to their mental condition and tendencies such as dangerous, harmless, and dirty. Those who are dangerous are locked up in separate compartment, only being allowed outside when under the immediate care of an attendant. I see no reason for departing from this rule. There were no escapes. Nine patients died, being one less than last year, and two more than the average of the last ten years. There are in the asylum a great many patients whose mental condition is hopeless, and who are advanced in years, so that there must eventually be a considerable mortality. Of the deaths this year one was from senile decay, the deceased had been an inmate for nearly eleven years.
15 STATEMENT II. At the beginning of the year there were 28 criminal lunatics (22 males, 6 females) in the asylum. 3 (2 males, 1 female) were admitted, making a total treated of 31 (24 males, 7 females). Of these one died of small-pox and one was discharged cured, being declared by the visitors as capable of making his defence. Of the admissions two were cases of acute mania, the use of ganja being the cause in both cases; the third, a female, was melancholia16 work either on account of bodily weakness, or other cause they do not do so, and the entire freedom from any moral depression consequent on their confine- ment must also have some influence on their general bodily health. Mortality.17 This is equivalent to Rs. 9-3-10 per patient, which deducted from average cost given above leaves the actual cost to the Government Rs. 55-5-3 per head per annum. The usual monthly meetings of the Official Visitors were held, and the asylum was inspected by the Chief Commissioner, Deputy Surgeon-General and the Inspector-General of Jails, Bengal. I can fully endorse the high opinion expressed by my predecessor on the conduct and zeal and intelligence of the Deputy Superintendent, Mohan Lal, 1st grade Hospital Assistant. JUBBULPORE: B.

From Statements IX and XI it is gathered that the following cash receipts were paid into the Treasury by the two Asylums during the years 1887 and 1888 respectively: No. 954. FROM G. C. CHESNAYE, ESQR. DEPUTY SURGEON GENERAL. Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 27th April 1889. SIR, I have the honour to forward, for submission to the Chief Commissioner, the Annual Report and Statements of Nagpur and Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylums for the year 1888. 2. At Nagpur a zanana compound wall with a cook-house for the Deputy Superintendent, quarters for keepers and a latrine for lunatics were built. At Jubbulpore the usual annual repairs were made by the Public Works Depart- ment. A new roof with large Jubbulpore tiling was put on by order of the Commissioner. STATEMENT I. 3. The number of admissions at Nagpur was less by 7 when compared with that of 1887, while at Jubbulpore they were 10 more than in 1887. 4. The number discharged from the Nagpur Asylum was less by one-half than in 1887. Out of the 19 patients discharged from the Nagpur Asylum, 9 were cured and 5 improved ; at Jubbulpore 6 patients were discharged all were actually cured. The daily average strength was 7.27 less at Nagpur, 5.68 more in Jubbulpore than in 1887. 5. The percentage of cured to daily average strength was less than that of 1887 in both the asylums, at Nagpur it was less by one-half nearly than in 1887 ; but when compared with the mean of previous years it was nearly equal. The percentage of cured to admissions was also considerably less in both the asylums. The figures were at Nagpur and Jubbulpore 20.19 and 29.33 respec- tively less than in 1887. 6. The percentages of deaths to daily average strength and to admissions were less in both the asylums than that of 1886 and 1887.
2 7. The following table is appended as usual:3 The following are the total admissions into hospital from all causes at both the asylums in 1887 and 1888 :4 The year 1888 having been on the whole an exceptionally healthy one, it is difficult to say how far the altered diet scale has affected the health of the lunatics.

Diarrh6 With reference to the Chief Commissioner's letter No. 6445-344 of the 3rd November 1888, regarding the adjustment of the value of Europe medicines, the Superintendents have been requested to send separate indents in future. The cost under this head will be given correctly in future annual returns.

A zenana-compound-wall with a cook house for the Deputy Superintendent, quarters for keepers and a latrine for lunatics were built during the year. STATEMENT I. 2. The number of admissions exceeded the average for the ten years 18778 three were cases of debility remaining from the previous year, one died worn out from leprosy, one from acute mania after twenty-four days' residence only, and one died in an epileptic fit after having been fed by en9 and to the construction of a cattle shed ; and (c) heavier charges by the Public Works Department. The items are thus made up:10 Annual Report on the Lunatic Asylum, Jubbulpore, for the year 1888- Additions and alterations. The usual annual repairs were done by the Public Works Department. For some reason, which I am unable to give, some of the Asylum buildings are ex- cluded from the charge of the Executive Engineer, e. g. the barrack outside the railed enclosure known as the" Hospital," the Deputy Superintendent's quarters. and the latrines both within and without the enclosure. In March last, the hospital barrack required re-roofing, and some correspondence took place between the Executive Engineer and the Asylum authorities, regarding it, the former stating that the building was not on his books, but as the work was urgent, and the Superintendent of the Asylum had no means for carrying out such works the Commissioner of the Division intervened, and ordered the work to be done at once. A new roof with large Jubbulpore tiling was put on. The official visitors in their last meeting recorded their opinion that arrangements should be made for bringing all buildings of every kind pertaining to the Asylum on the books of the Department Public Works. Statement I. There was an increase in the strength of the Asylum last year, the daily average strength was greater than in any of the past ten years, but there was no overcrowding. The number remaining on the 31st January was 132 (101 males, 31 females). The average remaining for the past ten years was 130.4, so there was very little variation. There were 25 admissions (22 males, 3 females) making a total of 157 (123 males, 34 females) ; of these, 6 (5 males, 1 female) were dis- charged cured, and 7 (5 males, 2 females) died, leaving 144(113 males, 31 females) remaining at the end of the year. There were no re-admissions. Of the 25 admissions, 7 (6 males, 1 female) were criminal lunatics. Of the 6 discharged cured, two were cases of chronic mania, one had been in the Asylum for 5 years and 4 months, the other one year ; four were cases of acute mania ; their residence in the Asylum varied from 5 months to 18 months. The capacity of the Jubbulpore Asylum is at 54 superficial feet per patient for 163 (125 males 38 females). The maximum number confined on any one night was 148(116 males, 32 females) so there was no overcrowding on either side- The daily average strength was 141.43 compared with 135.75 in the preceding year, but this included 6 patients received from the Rewah State, and 3 from Central India. One patient was also received from the Betul district, this was a criminal lunatic, a female ; the order directing her transfer to Jubbulpore was evidently a mistake, as the Betul district, as a rule, sends its lunatics to the Nagpur Asylum. It has not been found necessary to make any alteration in the arrangement formerly made by which the patients are divided into classes according to their condition as dangerous, harmless, or dirty ; no distinction is made between criminal and non-criminal. Many of the former are only criminal because they were found committing some petty theft, and when taken up it was discovered they were insane and did not know the nature of the act they had committed.
11 There were 7 deaths (5 males, 2 females)12 The daily average number of sick was 4.73 as compared with 3.65 in 1887, the increase was caused by every case being admitted to hospital, even trifling cases, such as gumboil and whitlow, were not omitted; even with these additions the number of sick is remarkably small, particularly when we consider the large number of old patients the Asylum contains. The freedom from bowel complaints is very notable, there being only seven admissions to hospital and no deaths under this head ; this compares very favourably with the returns of the neigh- bouring jail.

14 The total cost per patient on daily average strength was Rs. 66-4-6 against Rs. 64-9-1 in 1887 ; the increase was due to higher price of food stuffs, and a more liberal allowance of warm clothing. This sum however does not show the actual cost to Government, as profits on manufactures, and receipts for paying patients, &c., must be deducted from the gross cost. Rs. a. p.

The usual monthly meetings were held, and the Asylum was regularly in- spected by the official visitors : the Deputy Surgeon-General also inspected the institution. The Deputy Superintendent Mohun Lall, 1st grade Hospital Assistant, continues to merit the praise bestowed upon him in former years for his kind- ness to, and careful management of, the patients, as well as for the zeal and intelligence with which he discharges all his duties.

DEPUTY SURGEON-GENERAL, Central Provinces, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 10th May 1890. SIR, I have the honour to forward, for submission to the Chief Commis sioner, the annual Report and Statements of the Nagpur and Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylums for the year 1889. 2. At Nagpur a new workshop was built by the Public Works Department. At Jubbulpore no new buildings were erected, but the usual annual repairs were done. The wooden gratings over the two large wells were replaced by stone slabs resting on iron rails, A bridge was built over the nallah between the south- western corner of the garden and the road leading to the city. Reservoir water was laid on to the female enclosure and a shower bath was provided for the women in the hot weather. The pipe leading to the male enclosure was changed from one of half an inch to an inch in diameter. A large piece of ground situated between the old garden and the road, measuring about 2 1/2 acres, was brought under cultivation and yielded good crops of onions and potatoes. STATEMENT I. 3. The number of admissions at Nagpur was greater by 5 when compared with that of 1888, and when compared with the mean of the previous four years it was slightly less ; while at Jubbulpore the admissions in 1889 were less by 8 compared with 1888, and nearly equal to the average of the previous 4 years. 4. The number discharged from the Nagpur Asylum was less by 8 com- pared with 1888. Out of 11 patients discharged, 6 were " cured, " 1 " improved, " and 4 " otherwise:" three of these were merely transfers from the criminal to the non-criminal list, and one escaped. At Jubbulpore 7 patients were dis- charged,2 The percentage of cured to admissions was less at Nagpur (3 In another sense too these figures must be accepted with caution, for in most cases in which the cause of insanity is attributed to grief, anger, fear or the like, the true cause lies in the heredity of the individual. STATEMENT No. VIII. 14. The average daily sick was more in both the asylums than in 1888. The average at Nagpur was 10.12 or 1.62 more than in the previous year; but the figures when compared with the mean of the previous 4 years is less by 1.47. At Jubbulpore the average is 6.72 or 1.99 more than in 1888, and here also when compared with the average of 4 years it is higher by 3.54. The percentage of sick to daily strength for the two asylums in 1889 is as follows:4 16. During the year 1889 cases of cholera occurred in the towns of Nagpur and Jubbulpore, but the out-break was specially severe in Nagpur and its suburbs where 538 fatal cases were registered, while at Jubbulpore only 53 deaths were recorded under this head. The first case of cholera occurred in the Nagpur Asylum on the 11th May, and between that date and the 13th September 11 lunatics suffered from the disease, of whom 8 died. Dr. Barter has given in his report an account of the measures he adopted to stay the disease. There was no cholera in the Jubbulpore Asylum, though, as before stated, the disease prevailed in the town. 17. Both the ratios of deaths to strength and of deaths to admissions are greater than in the previous year in both asylums. This is more readily seen in the following table:5 Similarly, in the Jubbulpore Asylum the average of the ten years is 5.38 and in 1889, 15.16, which is a higher rate of mortality than that of Nagpur, when it is borne in mind that no epidemic prevailed at the former asylum. The Superintendent of each asylum, as before stated, has explained his views as to the causes which led to this excessive mortality. 18. A ready comparison of the sickness and mortality of the asylums of these Provinces with those of others is afforded in the accompanying table :6 The following Statement shows the cost per patient under different headings of account at the two asylums in 1888 and 1889:7 Annual Report on the Nagpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1889. The number admitted into the asylum was slightly less than the average for the previous four years, the period during which Berar lunatics were received. Re-admissions (5) are recorded above the average, but of these only two had previously been in the asylum, and the remaining three were merely transfers from the criminal to the non-criminal list. Only six were discharged "cured," their periods of residence varying from forty days to ten months: four of these suffered from acute mania and two from dementia : the former recovered soonest. One case was discharged "improved," so the total cured and improved reached seven only. Four are shown as discharged "otherwise :" three of these were merely transfers as above noted, one escaped and is still at large. The year generally proved a very unhealthy one : admissions to the Police hospital stood at 534, as against 482 in 1888 and 569 in 1887. The District mor- tality is recorded at 23,533 or 33.74 per 1,000 of population in 1887. In 1888 it stood at 16,979 or 24 per 1,000, and in 1889 at 30,162 or 43 per 1,000; and exclud- ing cholera 2,969, and small-pox 3,244, the mortality stood at 34 per 1,000. Every month during the year, December excepted, showed higher mortality in the dis- trict than for corresponding months, calculated on the average for the previous five years, as may be seen by the following table :8 disease of the heart and one died from bronchitis. It will thus be seen that general debility is credited with about half the mortality of the year, deaths from cholera excluded : these cases of an9 bazar about a mile from the asylum. On the 11th of May the first case in the asylum took place, the subject of it had been twenty-three years a resident, he never went outside its limits and was employed in the cook-house. The nights being extremely hot he was excused from sleeping in a ward, and was attacked during the night as he slept near some keepers. He was taken at once to a temporary hospital, a thatched shed, but he soon became collapsed and died in forty-eight hours. His bedding, clothes, &c., were all destroyed. No further cases occurred during the eleven weeks following or until the 2nd of August when two cases occurred in the same barrack, and on the 10th another : the wards in which the cases had taken place were vacated at once. Again, on the night of the 13th, two cases occurred in the hospital ward, when I at once determined to move the men into camp, and by the evening sixty were as comfortable as circumstances admitted in thatched chuppers. There was little choice as to ground, a good deal of rain had fallen, and all but the high ground on the asylum farm was saturated, this however was fairly dry, in a good position near a good well, and at a suitable distance from the asylum buildings. On that evening two fatal cases occurred in camp, on the 20th and 24th two additional cases, also one who with other lunatics occupied one of the small wards in the asylum. The occurrence of each case necessitated abandoning the shed in which it took place, the camp was bodily moved twice, whilst the four buildings in which cases occurred were vacated one after another, the berths dismantled and the walls whitewashed; cooking for the camp was carried on there, and it may almost be said that communication between the camp and asylum ceased. Seven cases occurred in the wards and four in camp; the sick were treated in a hut at another part of the asylum grounds : every thing that was possible was done for them, yet eight died of eleven attacked. Later on, 13th September, one of the female keepers was attacked and recovered. I know of nothing in the sanitary condition of the asylum or its water- supply that might be pointed to as likely to favour cholera; latrine matter is trenched three quarters of a mile distant, and the water-supply is as pure as well water can be; the situation of the asylum is all that can be desired ; the official visitors have recorded monthly their approval of its cleanliness, and it has had the advantage of a visit from the Surgeon-General with the Govern- ment of India late in the year, whose Minute on its condition does not contain any remark indicative of sanitary defects. The men were not brought back to the asylum from camp till the 26th September, as there seemed to be some delay or difficulty in regard to the necessary whitewashing : to what extent this protracted stay in camp during the rainy season resulted in increasing the sick list or swelling the mortality roll it is difficult now to determine; it is reasonable, however, to assume that the men would have been more comfort- able on dry berths in dry wards than on straw on the ground in grass chuppers more or less exposed to rain and dampness. Mortality occurred in the follow- ing months :10 in August, thus:11 The item value of articles received from the manufacturing department is made up as follows :12 Annual Report on the Lunatic Asylum, Jubbulpore for the year 1889. Additions and alterations. All the asylum buildings are now on the books of the Public Works Department; and the usual annual repairs were done by it. The wooden gratings over the two large wells were replaced by stone slabs resting on iron rails. A bridge was built over the nullah between the south-western corner of the garden, and the road leading to the city. Reservoir water was laid on to the female enclosure and a shower bath was provided for the women ; in the hot weather, this form of ablution is much appreciated by both the male and female patients. The pipe leading to the male enclosure was changed from one of half an inch, to an inch in diameter. A large piece of ground situated between the old garden and the road, measuring about 2 1/2 acres, was included in the garden ; this was at once brought under cultivation: 40 maunds of potatoes and 57 maunds of onions were obtained from it during the year, which were valuable additions to the dietary of the asylum. There were no other alterations or additions. STATEMENT No. I. There was a slight decrease in the strength of the asylum compared with the preceding year. The statement shows that 144 (113 males, 31 females) remained at the beginning of the year ; 17 (14 males, 3 females) were admitted, making a total of 161 (127 males, 34 females) : of these, 6 (4 males, and 2 females) died, leaving 133 (105 males, 28 females) under treatment at the end of the year. With exception of the increased mortality, the figures are nearly those of the average of the last ten years. Of the 17 admissions, 3 were criminal lunatics. There were no re-admissions. Of the 6 discharged cured, 4 suffered from acute mania,13 STATEMENT No. III. Of the 17 admitted, 14 were Hindus, 2 Mahomedans, and one Christian. 9 came from the Jubbulpore District, 4 from Hoshangabad, 1 Nimar, 1 Mandla, 1 Bhandara, and 1 from Central India. STATEMENTS Nos. IV AND V. Do not require any comments here. STATEMENTS Nos. VI AND VII. The types of insanity of the patients remaining from previous years, have been dealt with in former reports. Of the 17 admissions in 1889, 9 were suffering from acute, recently developed, mania : the cause of insanity in 6 of these was unknown; grief, ganja smoking, and spirit drinking were the causes assigned for the remaining three cases. There were two cases of chronic mania; the cause in one was ganja smok- ing, and the other grief at the loss of her child immediately after child-birth. Three admissions from chronic dementia; spirit drinking was the cause of one, another was hereditary, and for the third no cause was assigned. Three cases of amentia were admitted: one was born an idiot, and of the other two no previous history could be obtained. STATEMENT No. VIII. Deals with bodily sickness. There were 98 admissions to hospital, against 83 for the year preceding. They were for a variety of diseases, but many of them very trivial. Fever heads the list with 26 admissions, bronchitis gives 9, anæmia 7, diarrh14 the asylum, nearly 4½ months. She had to be fed by force, and this was difficult. She gradually became weaker, and eventually died of exhaustion without any sign of bodily sickness. The average residence in this asylum of the above 21 fatal cases was 9 years. STATEMENT No. IX Is the Cash account. The receipts from the treasury amounted to Rs. 9,226 against Rs. 8,916 for the year preceding, showing an increase of Rs. 310. This was due first to the market price of wheat and dall being higher; second, to an expenditure of Rs. 150 for extending the reservoir water to the enclosure for females, and putting a larger pipe in the main enclosure ; and third, to our having to spend Rs. 61 more on manufacturing contingencies. STATEMENT No. X. The cost of establishment was Rs. 2,020-15-6 against Rs. 1,981-3-3 in 1888: this increase was due to the promotion to a higher grade of two warders. There was no increase of establishment; on the contrary, the establishment was less by one warder on the 31st December 1889. STATEMENT No. XI Deals with manufactures. There is very little difference compared with last year. Our net profits amounted to Rs. 730-15-0 against Rs. 702-0-5 for the year preceding, being an increase of Rs. 27-14-7. Manufactured articles to the value of Rs. 1,005-12-10 were supplied to the asylum for asylum purposes, against Rs. 947-2-8 for the year preceding.

16 The average cost per head was Rs. 69-14-7, against Rs. 66-4-6 in 1888; the increase was due to the higher price of food, and to the cost of establishment having to be divided among a smaller daily average strength. Contingencies per head of average strength were Rs. 2-6-2 compared with Rs. 1-6-5 in the preceding year, this was caused by the cost of laying a larger water pipe to the male enclosure and extending the water-supply to the female enclosure. The actual cost to Government of each patient is only arrived at after deducting the profits on manufactures and the receipts for paying patients. This latter class always increase the gross cost of diet, as they are allowed extras not given to the pauper patientsSTATEMENTS.

REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS OF THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1890. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] NAGPUR: PRINTED AT THE SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1891. [PRICE EIGHT ANNAS.]
No. 3865/418 Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, in the General Department,2 3. The number discharged as cured from the Nagpur Asylum was 8 against 6 in the preceding year, the corresponding figures for the Jubbulpore Asylum being 7 and 6. In both asylums the percentage of cured to daily average strength was somewhat higher than in 1889, the figures being as shown below:3 The alleged immediate causes of insanity among these persons are thus classified:No. 1375. FROM J. G. PILCHER, ESQ., F. R. C. S., DEPUTY SURGEON-GENERAL, Central Provinces, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Pachmarhi, the 9th May 1891. SIR, I have the honour to forward, for submission to the Chief Commissioner, the annual Report and Statements of the Nagpur and Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylums for the year 1890. 2. At Nagpur, to afford protection in wet weather, verandahs were added to Wards Nos. 1 and 2, and, in accordance with the suggestions of the Jail Commission, the seven small barred windows were converted into grated doors. In Wards Nos. 2 and 3 barred doorways were also constructed at the east and west ends, and similar openings were made in the female wards. The annual repairs were, as usual, carried out to all the buildings. At Jubbulpore, in addition to the ordinary repairs, a great improvement was effected by the removal of the walls of the airing yard in front of each of the separate cells, and the addition of a verandah in front of the cells. The improvements made at Nagpur and Jubbulpore are explained in the original reports of the Superintendents. They will greatly add to the health and comfort of the lunatics. STATEMENT I. 3. The number of admissions to the Asylum at Nagpur was less by 1 than in 1889, and at Jubbulpore 6 more were admitted. 4. The number of patients discharged from the Nagpur Asylum in the year was 19, or 8 more than in the previous year. Of the 19, 8 were returned as cured, 5 improved, and 6 otherwise. At Jubbulpore there were 9 discharged, 7 as cured and 2 improved. 5. In both institutions the daily average strength was less than in 1889. It was less by 11.28 at Nagpur, and at Jubbulpore by 7.76. 6. The percentage of cured to the daily average strength was greater in both asylums. At Nagpur it was 2.13 and at Jubbulpore 1.02 better than in the previous year. The percentage of cured to admissions was also greater at Nagpur by 8.34, but it was less by 10.75 at Jubbulpore than in 1889. 7. The year 1890 was a healthy one notwithstanding the epidemic of influenza which was general in both asylums, and the percentage of deaths to daily average strength and to admissions was considerably more favourable in both asylums.
2 8. There was no over-crowding in either institution, for not only was the daily average of inmates much below the accommodation, but there was an even distribution of the patients over the whole dormitory space. 9. The following figured Statement, Table I, shows the results of the working of the asylums in other Provinces in 1889 and those of the two asylums in these Provinces in the years 1889 and 1890.

The number of admissions of criminal lunatics in 1890 at Nagpur and Jubbulpore was greater than the mean of the previous ten years. At Jubbul- pore the increase of 1890 was double that of 1889. There were 2 re-admissions of this class at the Nagpur Asylum. The daily average strength of criminal lunatics in 1890 was nearly equal at Nagpur, but at Jubbulpore it was 2.74 less than in 1889. 11. Statements III to V call for no comment. 12. Statement VI is now prepared in accordance with the instructions contained in the orders of the Government of India, No. 5-333 of the 13th May 1890. The classification of the Statement will be seen to differ from that of previous years, but it has very properly been made to correspond with the authorized nomenclature of diseases as published by the College of Physicians in 1885. 13. The alleged causes of insanity as given in the Statement must be accepted with caution, for the obvious reason that heredity has more to do with the origin of mental disease, whatever may be the immediate or exciting cause. 14. The daily average sick at Nagpur was 13.47, or 3.35 more than in 1889 and 2.18 greater than the mean of the five years. At Jubbulpore the average was 5.55, or 1.17 less than in 1889 ; but it was higher by 1.66 than the mean of the last five years. The percentage of sick to daily average strength for the two asylums in 1890 was as follows :3 15. The following Table gives the principal diseases for which lunatics were treated in Hospital of both asylums during 1889-90 :4 There was no case of cholera in either asylum, but the admissions from all causes at Nagpur were greatly in excess of those of the previous year. The epidemic of influenza may be said to have affected the whole popula- tion of both asylums, although it was not found necessary to admit to Hospital more than 29 sufferers in the Nagpur, and 27 in the Jubbulpore Asylum. 16. The ratio of deaths to daily average strength and to the admissions in both asylums was very much lower than that of 1889, and is exhibited in the following Table:5 There was 1 death from influenza, 2 from fever, 1 from bronchitis, 2 from debility, and 2 from other causes. In this asylum the mean death-rate of the last 10 years is 9.81, and that of 1890, 6.76 per cent of the average daily strength. At Jubbulpore the death-rate was rather higher than the mean6 21. The average cost of each patient in both asylums was less in 1890 than it was in 1889. The decrease in Nagpur was as much as Rs. 3-4-11 and at Jubbulpore Rs. 1-4-3. 22. The following Statement shows the cost of each patient under the various headings of account at both institutions :7 25. The total net profits were greater at both asylums in 1890 than they were in 1889 by Rs. 368-10-6 at Nagpur and Rs. 141-3-2 at Jubbulpore. The net gain per head is also larger at both asylums, being Rs. 5-7-2 at Nagpur and Rs. 3-13-9 at Jubbulpore better than in 1889. The total cost per inmate is as under :Report on the Nagpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1890. STATEMENT No. I. Admissions. Discharges. During the year just closed 27 lunatics were admitted into the asylum from the Central Provinces (21 males and 6 females), and 3 lunatics from Berar (2 males and 1 female). In all there were 30 new admissions. In addition there were 2 re-admissions, one each from the Central Provinces and Berar. As compared with last year the total admissions were slightly less in 1890 than in 1889. Eight of the inmates of the asylum, five Central Provinces and three Berar (7 males and 1 female), were during the year discharged as " cured,'' their periods of residence varying from 2 months and 15 days to 1 year and 3½ months. Of those discharged " cured " there were 5 cases of mania and 3 cases of dementia: 5 lunatics were discharged as "improved" and made over to their friends; amongst these were 4 cases of mania and 1 case of melancholia: 6 lunatics were discharged " otherwise," 5 to stand their trial, and 1 to the Nagpur Central Jail to work out his sentence. Mortality. The year generally, as compared with 1889, was a healthy one throughout the district. The mortality in the Lunatic Asylum was very small and lower than any year since 1884. In all 8 deaths occurred (7 males and 1 female). Statement VIII shows the causes of admissions to hospital. The daily average strength was lower than in the previous year, 118.27 against 129.55 of 1889. The average daily sick was 13.47 against 10.12 of the previous year. STATEMENT No. II. Criminal lunatics. Eleven criminal lunatics, 10 from the Central Provinces and 1 from Berar, were admitted against 13 in 1889. There were 2 re-admissions, one from the Central Provinces and one from Berar in 1890, none in 1889 ; 7 criminal lunatics were discharged, and 2 died. Amongst the criminal lunatics there were 3 cases of mania, 4 cases of dementia, 1 case of melancholia, 1 case of consecutive insanity, 1 case of epileptic insanity, and 1 case returned as " not insane." At the end of the year there were 45 criminal lunatics remaining in the asylum (41 males and 4 females). This is the highest number since 1880. STATEMENT No. III. Religion, sex and residence. Out of the 32 admissions during 1890, 14 came from Nagpur, and 4 each from Bilaspur, Hyderabad Assigned Districts and Raipur, and 2 each from Balaghat and Bhandara, and one each from Chhindwara and Wardha. There were 20 Hindus, 6 Mahomed- ans, 1 Christian and 5 of other castes. STATEMENT No. IV. Occupations. The largest number of admissions were from amongst the cultivating and beggar classes.
2 STATEMENT No. V. Ages of patients. The largest number of admissions were between the ages of 20 and 40 (21 admissions) and 40 and 60 (7 admissions.) STATEMENT No, VI. Types of insanity. In the reports of previous years the character and types of those who have remained from previous years have been commented on very fully, and do not need recapitulation here. Taking the 32 admissions during 1890, there were 15 cases of dementia including acquired imbecility, 11 cases of mania, 1 of melancholia, 1 of idiocy, 2 of epileptic insanity, 1 of consecutive insanity; 1 man who was sent from Raipur as insane, has up to date shown no signs of insanity since his admission to the asylum. The apparent cause in the case shown as " consecutive insanity " was a severe attack of fever. He was reported to have nearly throttled his two children and subsequently to have set fire to his own house. Was admitted in June to the asylum, but has shown no signs of insanity since his admission and appears quite sane. His friends are unwilling, however, to look after him. As the nomenclature of diseases employed in Statement No. VI has been changed in 1890, it has become necessary to change some of the diseases of those reported in previous years. STATEMENT No. VII. Alleged causes of insanity. As usual the alleged causes are of the vaguest and most untrustworthy description. The physical causes (fever, epilepsy, &c.) of insanity account for 4 out of the total of the admis- sions in 1890. The moral causes (grief, anger, fear, &c.) claim a like number. In 24 cases the cause was unknown or could not be ascertained. STATEMENT No. VIII. Return of sick in hospital. In all 148 lunatics were admitted to hospital. The largest number of admissions was from ague (53 cases). There were 29 cases of influenza during the months of March and April when the epidemic prevailed throughout India. There were 13 lunatics admitted to hospital for general debility. The causes of death were : 3 Resolution No. 34 ance with the suggestions of the late Jail Commission. In Wards Nos. 2 and 3 barred doorways were made at the east and west ends for the same reason. Similarly openings were made in the female ward. In all cases the new door- ways were protected by small verandahs. Additions and improvements were made to the servants' quarters. Brigade-Surgeon J. F. Barter held charge up to the 20th April, Surgeon- Major G. Bomford, M. D., up to the 3rd November. The usual monthly meetings of Visitors of the Asylum were held. The asylum was inspected by the Deputy Surgeon-General, Central Provinces, on the 3rd September. The Deputy Superintendent, 1st grade Hospital Assistant Abdul Majid Khan, has discharged his duties to my satisfaction. G. F. A. HARRIS, NAGPUR : Surgeon-Major, The 1st March 1891. Superintendent, Lunatic Asylum.
Report on the Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylum for the year 1890. ADDITIONS AND ALTERATIONS. The usual annual repairs were done by the Public Works Department. The only alterations carried out during the year were the removal of the walls of the airing yard in front of each of the separate cells, and the addition of a verandah in front of the cells. This was a great improvement, as the walls of the yard prevented the free perflation of air, so necessary in the rains, and the verandah keeps the cells cool in the hot season and dry in the monsoon. The erection of quarters for the keepers is still required ; at present they have to live in the bazar or in the verandah of the barracks. It is desirable that they should reside on the Asylum premises, and as there is ample space in front of the main gate, quarters similar to those erected at the Jail and Reformatory for their establishment should be provided. STATEMENT No. I. Shows that 133 (105 males, 28 females) remained at the beginning of the year; 23 (19 males, 4 females) were admitted, making a total of 156 (124 males, 32 females). Of these, 7 (6 males, 1 female) were discharged cured, 2 males discharged improved, and 13 (8 males, 5 females) died, leaving 134 (108 males, 26 females) under treatment at the end of the year. Compared with last year the admissions were 23 against 17, discharges 9 against 7, and the death 13 against 21: the total strength remaining being almost the, same as at the end of 1889, being 134 against 133. Of the 23 admissions, 6 were criminal lunatics, and 1 was sent from Native States who pay for their maintenance. The remainder were non-criminal lunatics. Of the 7 discharged cured, 4 (3 males, 1 female) were criminal lunatics ; the 2 discharged as improved and made over to their relatives were non- criminals. There were no escapes. The capacity of the asylum is for 163 (125 males, 32 females); the greatest number on any one night was 139 (109 males, 30 females), so there was no over-crowding. The percentage of cured to daily average strength was nearly the same as last year, viz., 5.35 against 5.77. The percentage of cured to admissions was less than in 1889, being 30.43 against 41.18. The percentage of deaths to strength was 9.94 compared with 15.16, and to admissions 56.52 compared with 123.53 in the previous year. STATEMENT No. II. Deals with criminal lunatics. 31 (26 males, 5 females) remained: 6 male were admitted during the year, making a total treated of 37 (32 males, 5 females): of these, 3 males died, and 4 were discharged cured, 1 was sent back to jail to complete his sentence, 2 were declared capable of making their defence and 1, a female, having been 22½ years in the asylum, was by order of the Local Administration handed over to the care of her brother.
6 STATEMENT No. III. Of the 23 admitted, 18 were Hindus, 2 Mahomedans, 1 Christian, and 2 of other castes. 13 come from the Jubbulpore District, 2 from Hoshangabad, 2 Mandla, 1 Damoh, 1 Saugor, 1 Nimar, 1 Rewate State, 1 from the Lunatic Asylum, Calcutta, and from the Lunatic Asylum, Rangoon. STATEMENTS NOS. IV AND V Do not require any comments, they explain themselves. STATEMENTS NOS. VI AND VII May be discussed together. Statement No. VI has been compiled in accordance with Government of India No. 57 be forcibly fed. Three of the deaths occurred in patients who were admitted in a dying condition and only lived 6, 7 and 19 days: two of these were cases of acute mania whose deaths took place from exhaustion, and the third was a congenital idiot, who was brought to the asylum a mere skeleton and died within 7 days. The average completed residence in the asylum of those who died, excluding the three last, was about 12½ years. STATEMENT No. IX AND No. X Is the cash account. The receipts from the Treasury amounted to Rs. 8,269 against Rs. 9,226 for the year preceding, showing a decrease of Rs. 957. This was due to a saving of Rs. 300 in establishment on account of difference in allowance drawn by the Officiating Superintendent for the months of August, September and October : 2ndly, to a saving of Rs. 412 on diet expenses, owing to the daily average strength being lower, and the price of dhall and wheat being cheaper than in 1889. In all other respects there was no deviation worthy of notice. STATEMENT No. XI Deals with the manufactures. There is very little difference compared with last year, but there is an increase in the credits of Rs. 48-13-6, and decrease in the debits of Rs. 57-5-8. The net profit amounted to Rs. 872-2-0, against Rs. 730-15-0 for the year preceding, being an increase of Rs. 141-3-0. Manu- factured articles to the value of Rs. 1,015-13-2 were supplied to the asylum for asylum purposes against Rs. 1,005-12-10 last year. The usual extra table is annexed which shows the cost of maintaining the lunatics for the past ten years:8 TABLE XII. Names of articles. 1881. 1882. 1883. 1884. 1885. 1886. 1887. 1888. 1889. 1890.

9 The average cost per head was Rs. 67-8-11 against Rs. 69-14-7 in 1889. The only items where there was an increase were clothing and medicines. The former was caused by a more liberal allowance of blankets than in former years, and the latter was so trifling as not to call for explanation. The great decrease under the head of Contingencies was on account of an unusual expenditure in 1839 for laying on water pipes to the enclosure for females. The average cost per head, Rs. 67-8-11, does not represent the actual coat to Government of each patient, because the sums paid into the Treasury in cash as profits on manufactures and for maintenance of paying patients, have not been deducted ; also the difference between the amounts drawn from the Treasury for manufacturing purposes and the amount shown as expenditure for diet and clothing supplied from the manufactory, should be credited. The followin Table shows the savings under the above heads and the net cost to the State for each patient per annum : STATEMENTS.

REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS OF THE CENTRAL PROVINCES, FOR THE YEAR 1891. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] NAGPUR: PRINTED AT THE SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1892. [ PRICE EIGHT ANNAS. ]
No. 2425. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, in the General Department,2 4. The most common types of insanity among the lunatics treated during the year were mania and dementia, of which there were 246 cases, out of a total of 317. In a large number of these 317 cases, viz. 172, the immediate cause of insanity was not traceable. 5. From the table given in paragraph 27 of the Report, it appears that the average cost of each patient fell in the Nagpur Asylum from Rs. 77-14-5 to Rs. 71-14-2, and rose in the Jubbulpore Asylum from Rs. 67-9-1 to Rs. 71-0-6. The cost of Superintendence is higher in the Jubbulpore than in the Nagpur Asylum Rs. 3,000 against Rs. 1,800), while Establishment charges are somewhat higher in the latter than the former. The cost of dieting was about the same in both institutions. Deducting receipts from paying patients and the net profits in the year of each asylum, each patient cost Rs. 52-14-2 at Nagpur, and Rs. 56-4-11 at Jubbulpore. The net profits were greater in both asylums than in the previous year. 6. Various structural improvements have been carried out or are in progress in the Nagpur Asylum. The chief of these is the construction of an enclosing wall and railing to the premises. The improvement of the water-supply has also received special attention. At Jubbulpore quarters were constructed for the Native Establishment. 7. As stated in paragraph 3 of the Report, it has been arranged, under the orders of the Government of India (Home Department No. 20, dated the 14th January 1892), that lunatics from Central India shall be admitted in future to the Jubbulpore Asylum. The Deputy Surgeon-General is mistaken in supposing that these orders extend to the reception of lunatics from Rai- putana. 8. The thanks of the Chief Commissioner are due to Dr. Franklin and Dr. Harris for their efficient management of the institutions under their charge. ORDER.No. 710. FROM SURGEON-COLONEL J. G. PILCHER, F. R. C. S., DEPUTY SURGEON-GENERAL, Central Provinces, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 15th March 1892. SIR, I have the honour to forward, for submission to the Chief Commissioner, the annual Report and Statements of the Lunatic Asylums in the Central Pro- vinces for the year 1891. 2. The charge of the asylum at Nagpur was held by Surgeon-Major Harris, and Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Franklin was the Superintendent of the asylum at Jubbulpore. Each held charge throughout the year. 3. These two asylums, in addition to providing accommodation for the insane of these Provinces, receive, in the case of Nagpur, the lunatics of the Berars, and the asylum at Jubbulpore will in future, under recent orders, admit cases sent to it from Rajputana and Central India. Additions and alterations. 4. At Nagpur extensive improvements have been and are in course of being carried out. Servants' quarters have been completed, the roofs of the male and female cells have been boarded over, and a window for ventilation added to each female cell.

Of criminal lunatics remaining under treatment in January 1891, there were 45 at Nagpur and 30 at Jubbulpore. The admissions (5) were fewer at Nagpur than they had been for the four previous years, but greater (8) at Jubbulpore than in the ten years ending with 1891. Of the re-admissions of criminal lunatics, there were 5 at Nagpur and none at Jubbulpore, and there is little material difference in the daily average strength of this class between the years 1890 and 1891. 15. Statements III to V4 19. Table II shows the principal causes of admission to hospital:5 There was a marked absence of bowel complaint in this asylum during 1890, as compared with previous years. In the Jubbulpore Asylum the sickness and mortality were somewhat greater than in the previous year ; the admissions being as 67 to 62, and the percentage of deaths to strength as 11.21 to 9.94. The daily average sick at both asylums was :6 epilepsy, fatty degeneration of the heart, and pneumonia. There were 3 deaths from other causes, one of which was suffocation, from food blocking the windpipe. 23. Table V compares the death causes in the asylums of the Central Provinces with those in the asylums of other Provinces. TABLE V. Provinces. Year. Percent- age of sick to strength.

The average actual cost per patient in the two asylums is very nearly the same, being Rs. 71-14-2 in Nagpur, and Rs. 71-0-6 in Jubbulpore. Exclud- ing the item Allowance of Superintendent, which is twice as great at Jubbulpore as at Nagpur, the expenditure under all other heads was greater at Nagpur, except a very small excess for diet at Jubbulpore. 27.

Statement X is a detail of the sanctioned establishment. 29. Statement XI gives details of the receipts and expenditure in manu- factures. In both asylums efforts are made to supply all that is used in the asylums themselves, and a small amount is realized by sales to the public in addition. 30. Statement XII is an abstract of the Cash Account, and gives for ten years8 33. It is instructive to compare the mean cost per head of the patients in the asylums of the Central Provinces with those of other Provinces, and to show this the following Table VII has been prepared:Report on the Nagpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1891. STATEMENT No. I. Admissions and discharges. During the year 15 lunatics were admitted into the asylum from the Central Provinces (12 males and 3 females) and 5 lunatics from the Berars (4 males and 1 female). There were 9 re-admissions in addition to the above (6 males and 1 female from the Central Provinces, and 2 males from the Berars). Compared with previous years, the total admissions in 1891 were lower than the figures of any of the previous 7 years. Five of the asylum inmates were discharged as "cured" during the year (3 males and 2 females), including one female belonging to the Berars: their periods of residence in the asylum varied from 7 months and 3 days to 22 months. Amongst those discharged "cured" was 1 case of mania, 3 cases of dementia, and 1 case of consecutive insanity. Six lunatics were discharged and made over to their friends as "improved;" these cases included 2 cases of mania, 1 of melancholia, and 3 cases of dementia. Four lunatics were discharged " otherwise," 3 to stand their trial, and 1 to the Nagpur Central Jail to work out his sentence. Mortality. The year generally until after the rains was a fairly healthy one throughout the district. The mortality in the asylum was low, being the same as in 1890 : 8 lunatics (7 males and 1 female) died during the year. Statement VIII shows the causes of admission to hospital. The daily average strength was 127.21, as compared with 118.27 of the previous year. The average number of daily sick was 12.97, against 13.47 in 1890. STATEMENT No. II. Criminal lunatics. Five criminal lunatics were admitted, all from the Central Provinces, against 11 admitted in 1890. There were 5 re-admissions of this class of lunatic (4 from the Central Provinces and 1 from the Berars), as compared with 2 re-admissions in 1890. Seven criminal lunatics were discharged, 3 to stand their trial, 3 made over to their friends, and 1 transferred to the Central Jail to work out his sentence. At the end of the year there were 47 criminal lunatics in the asylum (43 males and 4 females). This is an increase of 2 as compared with 1890, and the highest number that has been in the asylum since 1880. STATEMENT No. III. Religion, sex, and residence. Of the 29 admissions (24 males and 5 females) during 1891, the highest number, 12, came from the Nagpur District, 7 from the Berars, 5 from Raipur, and 1 each from the districts of Bhandara, Bilaspur, Chanda, Chhindwara and Wardha. There were 22 Hindus, 5 Mahomedans, 1 Christian, and 1 other caste. STATEMENT No. IV. Occupations. The begging, labouring and cultivating classes furnished the largest number of admissions, as was also noted in 1890. STATEMENT No. V. Ages. Requires no comment, and is sufficiently explanatory in itself. STATEMENT No. VI. Types of insanity. Analysing the types of insanity of the 29 total admissions during 1891, we find that there were 16 cases of mania, 9 cases of dementia including acquired imbecility, 1 of idiocy, 1 of epileptic insanity, 1 of toxic insanity, and 1 man re-transferred from the Central Jail. The case of idiocy above referred to is that of a deaf and dumb girl who is harmless, but appears to
2 have no friends who are willing to take charge of her. The case admitted as "toxic insanity" is that of a man who previously had been addicted to ganja, and was on account of mental unsoundness acquitted of the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, in 1886. He had been in the Central Jail since November 1886, and the Jail report states that he has been quiet and well behaved since May 1887. He was transferred to the asylum by the orders of the Local Government. The last case above referred to as "re-transferred" from the Central Jail was that of a criminal lunatic who committed murder in 1880, was tried and acquitted on the ground of insanity. He has shown no signs of insanity from the date of his first admission to the asylum in April 1881, and has worked at the Nagpur Central Jail most of the time. By the orders of Government he was re-transferred to the Lunatic Asylum for the purpose of being examined by a Commission, composed of the Judicial Commissioner, the Deputy Surgeon-General and the Superintendent of the Asylum, as to his mental condition. This Commission after examination found that he was not insane, but did not recommend his release. The man re-admitted from the Berars suffering from epileptic insanity, had been previously in the asylum and escaped in 1888. This man has still to be constantly watched and kept in confinement, owing to persistent attempts to escape. STATEMENT No. VII. Alleged causes of insanity. It is difficult to place any reliance on the various alleged causes of the insanity in parti- cular cases. Physical causes (fever, epilepsy, &c.) of insanity claim 9 out of the total admissions in 1891. In the cases of 20 lunatics no cause of the insanity could be traced. STATEMENT No. VIII. Return of sick to hospital. There were in all 96 admissions to hospital: remittent and intermittent types of fever accounted for 51 admissions, and there were 10 cases of bronchitis, and 1 isolated and fatal case of cholera occurred in the month of April. This man, who had been an inmate of the asylum since March 1889, was working with the other lunatics, and up to the date of his being attacked had been eating and drinking precisely the same regular food and water as the others did, and there were no known cases of cholera about in the station or district at the time. The symptoms were indistinguishable from those of ordinary cholera, but as the man was noted for filthy, dirty habits, and between meal times was in the habit of picking up and eating pieces of filth and rubbish that were lying about the asylum grounds, it is possible that he may have eaten some putred animal substance, and that it may have been a case of acute ptomaine poisoning, the symptoms of which sometimes are practically indistinguishable from those of cholera. It may be remarked that the great body of lunatics, not only at this time but through- out the year, remained singularly free from bowel complaints, and this is evident in that no cases of diarrh3 materially affected the quality of the vegetables grown during the months of July, August, Sep- tember and October, and diminished the quantity of some ingredient normally present in those vegetables (possibly vegetable salts?). In the case of the lunatics the worst effects noted were tumefaction and sponginess of the gums, an4 STATEMENT No. XII. Items of charge. 1886. 1887. 1888. 1889. 1890. 1891. Rs. a. p. Rs. a. p.

The kutcha flooring of wards 2 and 3 has been covered with stone flags, and the result is a decided improvement. The mehters and servants' quarters have been completed. The roofs of the male and female cells have been boarded, and small protected window openings have been made in the north wall of the female cells, to afford more free ventilation in the cells. The construction of a boundary wall and railings round the asylum limits was commenced at the close of the year. The usual annual repairs were executed. Surgeon-Major G. F. A. Harris held charge throughout the year. The usual monthly meetings of Visitors were held. The asylum was inspected by the Chief Commissioner on the 14th February, and by the Deputy Surgeon-General on the 10th March. The Deputy Superintendent, 1st grade Hospital Assistant Abdul Majid Khan, has, during the many years that he has been in charge of the asylum, gained much experience in the management of the lunatics, many of whom, being criminals, are apt to be violent and dan- gerous at times, and whose individual tempers and dispositions require much knowledge, tact, and delicate handling on the part of one placed in the position of the Deputy Superin- tendent ; and I have no hesitation in stating that he has discharged his duties to my complete satisfaction.

Report on the Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylum for the year 1891. Additions and alterations. A piece of Nazul land in front of the asylum main entrance, measuring 1 acre, 3 roods, 43 feet, was made over to the asylum with a view to keep the public at a greater distance, from the enclosure railings, and so ensure the privacy of the institution. This strip of land extends from the main road opposite the Reformatory to the Oomti river ; it has been defined by a ditch and hedge, and now the entire grounds are properly fenced in. Quarters for the Asylum Establishment have been erected facing the institution and on the ground taken up this year. These quarters have been built on the standard plan, and accommodate 8 male and 2 female warders and 2 sweepers. An iron gate has been put up at the entrance to the asylum grounds. The Deputy Superintendent's quarters have been re-roofed and put in a good state of repair. The usual annual repairs to the buildings were done by the Public Works Depart- ment. STATEMENT No. I. There was but little change in the strength of the asylum during the past year, the number remaining on the 1st January was 134 (108 males, 26 females). The average remaining for the past ten years was 133.4, so there was very little variation. There were 27 admissions (23 males, 4 females), and 2 re-admissions (1 male, 1 female), making a total of 163 (132 males, 31 females). Of these, 12 males were discharged cured, 2 (1 male, 1 female) discharged improved, 4 (3 males, 1 female) discharged otherwise, and 15 (12 males, 3 females) died, leaving 130 (104 males, 26 females) under treatment at the close of the year. Of the 27 admissions, 8 (7 males, 1 female) were criminal lunatics. Both the re-admissions were prisoner lunatics, who on completion of their sentence were transferred from the criminal to the non-criminal list. Of the 12 discharged, 8 were cases of mania, 3 of toxic insanity, and 1 of epileptic insanity; their residence in the asylum varying from 20 days to 16 years Of the 2 discharged improved, one was a criminal lunatic ; both were made over to the care of their relations on security being given for their proper custody. Of the 4 discharged otherwise (3 males, 1 female), one escaped, the other 3 were prisoner lunatics; of these latter, one was sent back to jail as not insane, and the other two were transferred to the non-criminal list on the completion of their sentences of imprisonment. The greatest number confined on any one night was 139 (112 males, 27 females); and as the capacity of the asylum is for 163 (125 males, 38 females) there was no over-crowding. The daily average strength was 133.77, compared with 130.79 in the preceding year. There was one escape6 STATEMENT No. III. There is little calling for remark under this Statement ; 24 out of 29 admissions were Hindus, 2 Christians, 1 Mahomedan, and 2 of other castes. 9 were from the Jubbulpore District, 5 from Narsinghpur, 4 from Saugor, 2 from Mandla, 1 from Nimar and 1 from Damoh ; 2 were sent from Central India. STATEMENTS Nos. IV AND V. Statements Nos. IV and V do not call for any remarks. STATEMENTS Nos. VI AND VII. Fourteen (13 males, 1 female), or nearly one-half the admissions, were for mania, 7 (5 males 2 females) for dementia and acquired imbecility, 1 (male) idiocy, 2 (males) toxic insanity, 2 (males) epileptic insanity, 1 (male) consecutive insanity following fever, and 2 (females) not yet diagnosed. The alleged cause of insanity of those admitted during the year, was 2 ganja smoking, 2 spirit drinking, 2 epilepsy, 2 grief, 1 fever, 1 religious impressions : in 19 cases it was impos- sible to trace the causes, for want of information regarding the previous history of these cases. STATEMENT No. VIII. This Statement shows the sickness and mortality. There were 67 admissions to hospital and 15 deaths, compared with 62 admissions and 13 deaths in the preceding year. As might be expected, intermittent fever gave most admissions, viz. 20, then general debility 6, an7 The usual extra Table is annexed, which shows the cost of maintaining the lunatics for the past 10 years :8 This Table shows an increased expenditure per head of Rs. 3-7-7, compared with 1890. The principal increase is under establishment, diet, and contingencies, the cause of which has been already explained. The actual cost to Government of each patient is, however, only arrived at after deducting from the cost of maintenance the sums credited to the Treasury as profits on manufactures, and the sums received from paying patients, who always increase the average cost of diet, being allowed extras not given to pauper patients. The following table shows the savings under the above heads, and the actual net cost to the State for each patient per annum: STATEMENTS.

REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS OF THE CENTRAL PROVINCES, FOR THE YEAR 1892. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] NAGPUR: PRINTED AT THE SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1893. [PRICE EIGHT ANNAS.]
No. 2342. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, in the General Department,2 6. The average annual cost of each patient was Rs. 72-1-10 at Nagpur, as compared with Rs. 71-14-2 in the preceding year, or Rs. 0-3-8 in excess. At Jubbulpore it was Rs. 68-12-11 against Rs. 71-0-6, or Rs. 2-3-7 less than in 1891. The total net cost per inmate, after deducting the receipts from paying patients and the net profits of industry, was Rs. 67-3-0 in the Nagpur and Rs. 54-1-11 in the Jubbulpore institution. The attention of all District Officers will be drawn to the Deputy Surgeon-General's remarks on the subject of enquiries as to the property possessed by non-criminal lunatics or the ability of their relations to contribute to their support. With regard to the purchase of supplies at the cheapest rates, the Chief Commissioner has already expressed his approval of the Deputy Surgeon-General's suggestion in paragraph 23 of the Report, provided that storage room can be provided for a year's stock of grain. The introduction of spinning and weaving industries into the Nagpur Asylum is a step in the right direction. The proposal to start dairy farms in connection with the asylums was considered, but the Chief Commissioner has decided that for the present the matter must remain in abeyance. 7. The thanks of the Chief Commissioner are due to Dr. Franklin and Dr. McKay for their efficient management of the institutions under their charge. ORDER.No. 603-542. FROM BRIGADE-SURGEON LT.-COL. W. CENTER, M. B., OFFG. DEPUTY SURGEON-GENERAL, Central Provinces, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 23rd February 1893. SIR, I have the honour to forward for submission to the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, the Annual Reports and Statements of the Lunatic Asylums in the Central Provinces for the year 1892. 2. The charge of the asylum at Nagpur from 1st to 18th April 1892 was held by Surgeon-Major Harris, and from 19th April to the end of the year by Surgeon-Major Mckay, and the charge at Jubbulpore by Surgeon-Lieutenant- Colonel B. Franklin. Additions and alterations. 3. At Nagpur extensive and radical improvements of great utility have been made during the year 1892:2 (5) The well at the entrance gate has been domed over to prevent suicides and also pollution, an opening for drawing water being left at the top. 4. At Jubbulpore, in addition to the usual annual repairs, a new latrine for males and females was built for the use of the warders and their families. The grounds are still unenclosed except by a hedge, and outside the asylum enclosure proper are dangerous cells, the cook-house and latrine. STATEMENT NO. I. 5. The populations treated at both asylums were nearly the same as last year. At Nagpur it was 158 against 154 of the preceding year, and at Jub- bulpore 165 against 163. 6. The number of admissions into the Nagpur Asylum was the lowest during the last 8 years; that at Jubbulpore was the highest since 1877. There were 27 admissions into the Nagpur Asylum in 1892, of which 25 were from the Central Provinces and 2 from Berar, while at Jubbulpore the admissions were 35, i. e., 32 from the Central Provinces and 3 from Central India. 7. The number of patients discharged from the Nagpur Asylum during the year under review was 17, or 2 more than in the preceding year. Of these 11 were cured, 4 improved and handed over to friends, 1 discharged (sentence expired) and 1 escaped. At Jubbulpore the number was 16, or 2 less than last year. Of these 13 were cured, 1 improved, 1 sent to undergo trial, and 1 escaped. 8. The daily average strength was slightly higher at both asylums. At Nagpur it was 130.76, exceeding that of 1891 by 3.55, and at Jubbulpore 139.863 TABLE I. Provinces. Year. Total popula- tion during the year. Daily average strength. Cured during the year.

II. 13. The number of fresh admissions of criminal lunatics at each asylum was 4. They were fewer at Nagpur than during any in the past 8 years, and at Jubbulpore they were 50 per cent. less than in 1891. There was only 1 re- admission at each asylum. The daily average strength of criminal lunatics in 1892 was also slightly less, 45.29 at Nagpur and 30.27 at Jubbulpore, or less by 0.86 and 1.29 res- pectively. STATEMENTS NOS. III, IV AND V. 14. These Statements call for no special comment. Statement No. III has been modified in accordance with Government of India No. 10 Medical/498. of 25th August 1892. STATEMENT NO. VI. 15. As usual the large majority of lunatics admitted were suffering from mania and dementia. Four cases of dementia are reported as recovered at Nagpur. A large number of cases of idiocy appear to be retained in the Jub- bulpore Asylum. In this country there are no regular asylums for idiots nor poor-houses, to which they might be sent, and when there are no relations found to take care of them, they must, if utterly helpless, be kept on grounds of humanity, till some means for their disposal are found. STATEMENT NO. VII. 16. The real causes of insanity cannot always be satisfactorily given as noted by my predecessor and by the Superintendents in this year's Reports. At Nagpur 103 out of a total of 158 treated are returned under "Causes unknown;" at Jubbulpore 68 out of a total of 165. Little can be made out as to the influence of heredity, as there is no proper information regarding family history forthcoming in the Police enquiry. At Nagpur 4 cases are entered as congenital or hereditary; at Jubbulpore none. At Jubbulpore 31 are noted as due to the use of Indian hemp, at Nagpur 18; while the total of those traced to the use of opium is only 4 and to alcohol 4. This is in accordance with the general experience, that of all intoxicants, Indian hemp is the most deleterious as a cause of insanity.
4 STATEMENT NO. VIII. 17. The total admissions into hospital in the Nagpur Asylum were 97 against 96 in the preceding year. At Jubbulpore they were 86 or 19 more than in 1891, but many of these were for trivial ailments. The following Table shows the principal causes of admissions to hospital:5 18. The daily average sick at Nagpur was 6.73 or 6.24 less than in 1891, while at Jubbulpore it was 6.09 against 5.30. 19. There were no cases of cholera in either asylum, but the epidemic of influenza affected both, causing 16 admissions at Nagpur, and 9 admissions and 1 death at Jubbulpore. 20. The chief cause of sickness at both asylums was as usual malarious fever, which gave 53 admissions at Nagpur and 27 at Jubbulpore. At Nagpur there were 3 admissions from bowel-complaints against 1 in the previous year. At Jubbulpore the admissions under this head were 7 against 6 in 1891. This small rate indicates that the food and water supply proved satisfactory. There was a marked decrease under the head bronchitis treated at the Nagpur Asylum. The cases admitted were only 2 against 10 in the preceding year; while at Jubbulpore the admissions rose from 1 in 1891 to 7 in 1892. At Nagpur, notwithstanding the plentiful supply of vegetables, there were 2 admissions for scurvy, and 18 were found with slight sponginess of the gums. 21. As regards mortality, the most notable point is its lowness compared with average asylum rates, and that at Jubbulpore 4 of the 8 deaths were those of very old debilitated patients. The individual causes of death require no special comment. 22. A comparison is made in the following table of the ratio of deaths to the daily average strength, and of the deaths to admission :6 Table V compares the death causes in the asylums of the Central Provinces with those in the asylums of other Provinces:7 The net profits were respectively Rs. 537-9-11 and Rs. 1,100-10-1. The aboli- tion of the Agricultural Farm at Nagpur without other industries being started accounts for the difference. The introduction of spinning thread and twine, weaving cotton cloth and blankets, has been recommended as most suitable, and looms have been purchased. The proposal to start dairy farms was considered. It would be possible to do so at both asylums, but I am doubtful as to the suc- cessful working of the scheme either at Nagpur or Jubbulpore. 26. From paying patients Rs. 106 were realized at Nagpur and Rs. 953 at Jubbulpore. A considerable part of this comes from pay of military luna- tics. These institutions are thus essentially pauper asylums. When lunatics are sent a stricter enquiry might be made by Magistrates as to whether the patients possess any property, or whether their friends are able and willing to contribute something to their maintenance, and it might be noted that such an enquiry has been made, with the result. In Table No. VI is seen the expenditure of the two institutions under the various headings :8 27. The average annual cost per head at Nagpur was Rs. 72-1-10 against Rs. 71-14-2 in the preceding year or Re. 0-3-8 in excess. At Jubbulpore it was Rs. 68-12-11 against Rs. 71-0-6 or Rs. 2-3-7 less than in 1891. 28. The total net profits were less at Nagpur by Rs. 1,781-0-11, which was due to the abolition of the farm as stated above. At Jubbulpore they were Rs. 30-1-8 more than in 1891. The cost per head for diet at Nagpur was Rs. 34-1-8. At Jubbulpore Rs. 28-11-8. A better system of laying in food supplies ought to reduce the Nagpur figure. 29. As noted by Dr. Franklin, the actual cost per head to the State is less than these figures, as garden produce and clothing, &c., manufactured by luna- tic labour and supplied to the asylum are in this return valued and entered at bazar rates. The difference between the cost of raw material, as seeds, cotton, wool, &c., and the value of garden produce and manufactured articlesReport on the Nagpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1892. STATEMENT NO. I. Admissions and discharges. There were 20 admissions into the asylum during the year from the Central Provinces (17 males, 3 females) and 2 (males) from the Berars. There were 5 re-admissions in addition (4 males, 1 female) from the Central Provinces. Total ... 22 (19 males, 3 females). Re-admissions ... 5 ( 4 males, 1 female). 27 23 4 The total admissions were lower than those of the previous 8 years. Eleven of the asylum inmates were discharged during the year:2 and one criminal lunatic died at the end of the year; there were 44 criminal lunatics:3 STATEMENT No. VIII. There were 97 admissions into hospital, against 96 in 1891 (85 males, 12 females). Of these4 The total expenditure was Rs. 29,457-3-4 against Rs. 12,003-13-10 in 1891 ; this is chiefly owing to the Public Works charges for the boundary wail and the water-supply. The dieting was Rs. 779-4-2 in excess of last year ; this is due to the dearness of grain. The average price of wheat and rice this year was 13 seers the rupee against 16 seers last year. The amount paid into the Treasury was Rs. 79-3-6, this is a great falling off and is due to the abolition of the Farm. Last year, the cattle and farm implements were sold. The sum of Rs. 79-3-6 represent only the sale of surplus vegetables. The net profit was only Rs. 537-9-11 against Rs. 2,318-10-10 due to the above cause. Instead of the Farm, looms for weaving cloth and blankets are being set up to give employment to the criminal lunatics more especially. STATEMENT No. XII. The following Table gives the average cost per lunatic under the various heads during the last 7 years. The total per head is Rs. 55-2-1 against Rs. 53-14-11, being Rs. 1-3-2 in excess of last year:5 The annual repairs have been carried out. Surgeon-Major Harris held charge of the asylum to the 18th April 1892, and Surgeon- Major H. K. McKay the remainder of the year. First Class Hospital Assistant Abdul Majid Khan was the Deputy Superintendent to the 23rd February 1892, and 1st Class Hospital Assistant Sheik Abdul Aziz the remainder of the year. He has worked well, shows great tact and is unremitting in his attention. I am well satisfied with his work. The usual monthly meetings were held. The asylum was inspected by the Deputy Surgeon-General on the 24th November and by the Chief Commissioner on the 22nd November 1892. H. K. McKAY, NAGPUR: The 23rd January 1893. Surgeon-Major, Superintendent, Lunatic Asylum.
Report on the Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylum for the year 1892. Additions and Alterations. In addition to the usual annual repairs to the buildings which were done by the Public Works Department, a few latrine for males and females was built for the use of the warders and their families. STATEMENT No. I. The number of patients remaining of 1st January was 130 (104 males, 26 females), this was a little below the average of the last ten years which was 134.3. The number of admissions, was 34 (26 males, 8 females) the highest number since 1877. There was one re-admissions, a criminal lunatic suffering from epileptic insanity. The total population was 165 (131 males, 34 females), of these 13 (11 males, 2 females) were discharged cured, 1 (male) discharged improved, 2 (1 male, 1 female) discharged otherwise, and 8 (7 males, 1 female) died, leaving 141 (111 males, 30 females) under treatment at the close of the year. Of the 34 admissions 4 (3 males, 1 female) were criminal lunatics. Of the 13 dis- charged cured, 9 were cases of mania, 2 of toxic insanity, and 2 of consecutive insanity following fever, their residence in the asylum varying from 2½ months to 3 years and 11 months. One was discharged improved, a case of dementia which after a residence in the asylum of more than 1½ years was made over to the care of his relatives on the usual security being given. Of the 2 discharged otherwise, one, a criminal lunatic, was sent to the Jail to undergo his trial, the other, a female, escaped from the asylum. The greatest number confined in any one night was 147 (116 males, 31 females), the capacity of the asylum being for 163 (125 males, 38 females), so there was no over-crowding. The daily average strength was 139.86 compared with 133.77 in the preceding year, this was an increase of 6.09. The percentage of cured to daily average strength was 9.30 against 8.97 in 1891. The percentage of cured to admissions was 37.14 against 41.38 last year. The percentage of deaths to daily average strength was 5.72 against 11.21 and to admissions 22.86 against 51.72 in the preceding year. STATEMENT No. II. At the beginning of the year there were 31 criminal lunatics (27 males, 4 females) in the asylum, 4 (3 males, 1 female) were admitted and one (male) was re-admitted making a total treated of 36 (31 males, 5 females), of these 2 died, 2 were declared by the official visitors as capable of making their defence, 1 was made over to the custody of his relatives, and 1, a female, esca ped from the asylum three days after her admission. The number remaining at the end of the year was 30, the average for the last ten years being 28.9. STATEMENT No. III. Of the 35 admissions 19 were sent by the Magistrate of Jubbulpore, 5 from Saugor, 4 from Nimar, 2 from Mandla, and 1 each from Narsinghpur, Rewah, Neemuch, Nowgong and Chhindwara. The latter district should send its lunatics to the Nagpur Asylum, vide Book Circular No. XXXI of 1892, but the case admitted was that of a criminal lunatic, and in the Chief Commissioner's orders the Jubbulpore Asylum was the place he was directed to be confined in. The great majority of the admissions, 26 were Hindus, 7 were Mahomedans with 1 Chris- tian and 1 other caste. STATEMENTS NOS. IV and V. These do not call for any remark.
7 STATEMENT No. VI. Thirteen (10 males, 3 females) or more than a third of the admissions were for Mania, 11 (8 males, 3 females) for dementia and acquired imbecility, 3 (males) for idiocy, 2 (1 male, 1 female) for melancholia, 2 (1 male, 1 female) for epileptic insanity, 2 (males) for toxic insanity, and 2 (males) for consecutive insanity after fever. STATEMENT No. VII. Deals with the causes of insanity, this is only known in 16 out of the 35 admitted during the year. Grief was the cause in 5, ganja smoking 4, epilepsy and sunstroke 3, use of bhang 2, and fever 2. It is to be regretted that in more than one-half (19) of the cases admitted no particulars of the patient's previous history was given by the police so as to enable some opinion to be formed as to the probable cause of the insanity. The orders of the Judicial Commissioner as laid down in his Circular No. 53, dated the 10th July 1885, directs that enquiries should be made, but as a rule the result is that " nothing could be ascertained." STATEMENT No. VIII. Gives the sickness and mortality. Sickness.8 I annex the usual extra Table XII which shows the total cost of maintaining the lunatics for the past ten years. TABLE XII.

9 This Table shows that the annual cost per patient on daily average strength was Rs. 68-12-9, against Rs. 71-0-6 in 1891, or a saving of Rs. 2-3-9 per head. The actual cost to Government for each patient is very much less than the above, as from it we must deduct the sums paid into the Treasury as profits on manufactures, the amount received from paying patients who always increase the average cost of diet, as they are allowed extras not given to pauper patients. The following Table shows the savings under the above heads and the actual net cost to the State for each patient per annum : STATEMENTS.

REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS OF THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1893. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] NAGPUR : PRINTED AT THE SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1894. [ PRICE EIGHT ANNAS. ]
No. 3217. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, in the General Department,2 5. The opening of the new Law Courts in Nagpur during the year has enabled the building formerly used for the Judicial Commissioner's Court-house to be added to the premises of the Lunatic Asylum, which it adjoins. It is being made into a female ward, and this arrangement greatly improves the accommodation. The Jubbulpore Asylum has also obtained some increase of space. The Chief Commissioner agrees with the Administrative Medical Officer that it is desirable that this asylum should be enclosed, and has lately requested that arrangements may be made with this object. The provision of accommodation for European lunatics at this asylum is also very desirable. 6. The alterations in the Financial Statements prescribed by the Resolu- tion of the Government of India in the Home Department, No. 8 (Medical), dated the 13th July 1893, make it difficult to compare the receipts and expendi- ture with those of preceding years. The receipts from paying patients during the year increased from Rs. 1,060 to Rs. 1,305, of which Rs. 1,145 was received at Jubbulpore, the greater proportion being due to the larger number of mili- tary lunatics there. Particular attention was drawn to this subject in the review of last year's report, and the Chief Commissioner trusts it will not be overlooked. The total average cost of each lunatic, as shown in Table XII in the Reports, fell from Rs. 55-2-1 in Nagpur and Rs. 68-12-9 in Jubbul- pore to Rs. 51-14-6 and Rs. 57-13-7 respectively, the larger reduction in Jubbul- pore being due to decrease in the Superintendent's allowance. The purchase and storage of grain so as to ensure the greatest economy continued to receive attention. Comparison of the cost per head of the inmates in the Central Pro- vinces asylums with the figures for asylums in other Provinces, as given in Table VII of the Administrative Medical Officer's report, speaks well for the economy of the management in these Provinces. 7. The Chief Commissioner inspected the asylum at Nagpur once and that at Jubbulpore twice during the year. The Administrative Medical Officer inspected the former four times and the latter once. The meetings of the official visitors were held regularly. 8. The Chief Commissioner has observed with satisfaction the healthiness of both asylums and the economy of their management, and acknowledges the excellent work of the officers in charge during the year and the careful super- vision of the Administrative Medical Officer. The Report was due in the Secretariat on the 10th February, but was not received till the 28th March, and this delay has not been explained. Greater punctuality should be observed in future. ORDER.No. 901. FROM SURGEON-COLONEL G. C. ROSS, ADMINISTRATIVE MEDICAL OFFICER AND SANITARY COMMR., Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 28th March 1894. SIR, I have the honour to forward for submission to the Chief Commis- sioner, Central Provinces, the Annual Report and Statements of the Lunatic Asylums in the Central Provinces for the year 1893. 2. The charge of the asylum at Nagpur from the 1st January to the 25th November 1893 was held by Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel H. K. McKay, and from the 26th November to the end of the year by Surgeon-Major Harris; and at Jubbulpore Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel B. Franklin held charge until the 6th April 1893, and Brigade-Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel J. B. Gaffney through- out the remainder of the year. Additions and Alterations. At Nagpur the Judicial Commissioner's Court has been added to the asylum premises, and the necessary alterations to put it into a fit state to serve as a female ward for lunatics have been sanctioned, and are being carried out. To enclose this building within the asylum premises it has been found necessary to pull down part of the wall and railings erected in 1892, and re-build it so as to enclose the Judicial Commissioner's Court. The old office can be given up for use as a hospital ward for contagious cases, and part of the new ward, which accommodates 35 lunatics, can be utilized partly as an office and partly as a surgery and dispensing room. With a small alteration in the east and west bungalows, one ward for males and one for females can be fitted up for the reception of European and Eurasian lunatics, as suggested in Secretariat letter No. 8265, dated the 13th November 1893. Vegetables are grown in the lower garden only; this will continue to be so until there is a sufficient supply of water to irrigate more land. An increased supply by means of a pump has been arranged for and the money sanctioned- so that in future more labour can be utilized and some profit made by sales. The usual annual repairs have been carried out. At Jubbulpore a wire fencing around the female asylum and a new gate at the end of the garden entrance have been made during the year. The build- ings on the portion of land formerly occupied by the Thaggi lines which was
2 made over to the asylum, were demolished and the whole enclosed by a wall 700 feet long and 6 feet high, exclusively by lunatics, without cost to the State. In the same way an open shed, with tiled roofing to protect the oil-mill, has also been erected. I consider that a fence of some kind round the asylum to prevent escapes is necessary. The usual ordinary annual repairs have been carried out. The Annual Returns are prepared in accordance with the instructions given in the proceedings of the Government of India, No. 83 Table I, giving the results in the asylums of the Central Provinces com- pared with those of other Provinces, is appended as usual:4 STATEMENT No. VIII. The total admissions into hospital in the Nagpur Asylum were 53 against 97 in the preceding year. At Jubbulpore there were 94 against 86. The following table shows the principal causes of admissions to hospital :5 The daily average sick at Nagpur was 2.74 or 3.99 less than in 1892, and at Jubbulpore it was 4.56 against 6.09. There were no cases of cholera. The chief cause of sickness at both asylums was, as usual, malarious fever, which gave 13 admissions at Nagpur against 53 in the preceding year, and at Jubbulpore the admissions under this head are equal both in 1892 and 1893, i. e., 27. At Jubbulpore 2 cases were admitted for dysentery, 5 for diarrh6 Table V compares the death causes in the asylums of the Central Pro- vinces with those in the asylums of other Provinces:7 Table No. VI, giving the expenditure of the two asylums under the various headings, is appended :Report on the Nagpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1893. STATEMENT No. I. Admission and Discharges. There were 35 admissions into the asylum during the year from the Central Provinces (30 males and 5 females) and 2 (males) from the Berars. There were also 8 re-admissions (7 males and 1 female) 2 STATEMENT No. III. Of the 45 admissions and re-admissions3 conjecture. I am inclined to believe more in the influence of heredity in the production of the greater number of cases of insanity than in direct toxic influences. I believe that ganja- smoking or chronic alcoholism or possibly the opium habit in one or either parent, all tend to predispose to the production of a mentally weak-fibred progeny with unstable minds, prone to give away from slight causes, physical or mental, and in fact produce a kind of moral insanity; but this result will be brought about indirectly through inheritance, in most cases. Ganja does also, undoubtedly, directly produce an acute type of insanity in the same way as a large amount of alcohol will produce temporary mental excitement and delirium, but in my experience the mental condition passes off sooner or later and is a temporary one in the majority of cases. Chronic ganja-consumers I would place in the same category as chronic dipsomaniacs, and look upon them as individuals in whom the evil habit was a consequence of their mental instability and not the cause of it. STATEMENT No. VIII. The year was a very healthy one. There were 53 admissions into hospital (49 males and 4 females), against 97 in 1892 and 96 in 1891. The following table shows the chief causes of admissions to hospital :4 were three paying patients5 By sanction of the Chief Commissioner a large stock of grain was stored up in June, when the rate was lower than the bazaar rate. The plan has answered well, and the stock of grain stored up has not deteriorated to any great extent or become mouldy. It will probably be better to purchase the grain in the extreme hot months and pack it in " dolees" when quite dry. It will then be less liable to be eaten by weavils or to grow mouldy. Alterations and improve- ments. The Judicial Commissioner's Court has been added to the asylum premises, and the neces- sary alterations to put it into a fit state to serve as a male ward for lunatics have been sanctioned and are being carried out. To enclose this building within the asylum limits, it has been found necessary to pull down part of the wall and railings erected in 1892, and rebuild it so as to enclose the Judicial Commissioner's Court. At present we are obliged to use the west bungalow (recently enclosed within the female enclosure) for a few male lunatics, and the arrangement has had the sanction of the Deputy Surgeon-General. The new ward is calculated to accommodate 35 lunatics. Part of it will be utilized as an office, and part as a surgery and dispensing room, and the old office can be given up for use as a hospital ward for contagious cases, for which purpose it is convenient as it is next to the present hospital. The Chief Commissioner has sanctioned small alterations in the east and west bungalows, by which one of the side rooms in each of these wards can be shut off and fitted up for the reception of European and Eurasian lunatics, one for males and one for females. The main supply of vegatables has been produced from the lower garden and must continue to be so for sometime, until by a sufficient supply of water, and by improvements in the soil, the new garden recently made within the railed enclosure is better adapted to grow a sufficient stock of vegetables. At present the water supply is quite insufficient, and the soil is rocky and bad, and although this is gradually being removed and good soil and manure put in it, this will take a long time. The present water reservoir is capacious enough for drinking and washing purposes, but not for irrigation. More water could be readily got if a pump were attached to the well within the enclosure above noted as recently added to the asylum limits, and this being within the asylum enclosure, we could utilize the labour of the criminal lunatics to work the pump. The annual repairs have been carried out. Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel H. K. McKay held charge until the 25th November 1893, and Surgeon-Major G. F. A. Harris throughout the remainder of the year. First Class Hospital Assistant Sheikh Abdul Aziz was the Deputy Superintendent up to the 9th July, and First Class Hospital Assistant Abdul Majid Khan held charge for the remainder of the year. The latter has much skill and experience in the management of the lunatics and is unremitting in his attention to their well-being, and I am very well satisfied with the manner in which he has performed his duties. The usual monthly visitors' meetings were held, and the half-yearly inspections of criminal lunatics on the 9th January and 12th July 1893. The asylum was inspected by the Chief Commissioner on the 11th August 1893, and by the Deputy Surgeon-General on the 14th February, 22nd June, 20th and 26th July 1893. NAGPUR : G. F. A.

Report on the Jubbulpore lunatic Asylum, for the year 1893. ADDITIONS AND ALTERATIONS. In addition to the ordinary annual repairs, the following is a list of works carried out at the Lunatic Asylum during the year:7 Of the 5 under Class (b), one Baba, I think, ought not to have been sent as a criminal lunatic as he was challaned under Section 109 of the Criminal Procedure Code (security for good behaviour). This is not a criminal offence under the Indian Penal Code, so he ought to have been sent to the asylum as a non-criminal lunatic and be dealt with as such, but as the Chief Commissioner directs, under Section 466 of the Criminal Procedure Code, that he be confined as a lunatic, he is treated as a criminal lunatic. The second case.8 The Native States contributed:9 STATEMENT No. VII. Alleged cases of insanity. Of the total of 33 admissions, 9 are attributed to ganja- smoking; of those but 2 have been registered under the heading of Toxic insanity. Ganja may have played its part in contributing to the insanity, but in the absence of reliable evidence 7 were otherwise classified ; 2 cases were classified as due to epilepsy and 1 to heredity ; total due to physical causes10 which are generally clean and neat; 2 were employed in tailoring, which is one of the most useful works in a Lunatic Asylum. From 25 to 31 are either imbeciles or too uncertain in their tempers to be entrusted with work. The usual extra Table No. XII is annexed, which shows the comparative cost of maintaining the lunatics for the past 10 years. TABLE XII.

11 The average cost per head was Rs. 57-13-7 against Rs. 68-12-9 in 1892. The only item where there was a slight increase was " Contingencies." The actual cost to Government for each patient is very much less than the average of the last 10 years, as from it must be deducted the sum paid into the Treasury as profits on manufactures and the amount received from paying patients, who always increase the average cost of diet, as they are allowed extras not given to pauper patients. The following table shows the savings under the above heads and the net cost to the Government for each patient per annum :12 Surgeon-Leutenant-Colonel Franklin held charge of the asylum from the 1st January to the 6th April, when I took over charge. First Class Hospital Assistant Mohun Lall has been Deputy Superintendent for the last 12 years and has always given complete satisfaction to my predecessors. To meSTATEMENTS.

REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS OF THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1894. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] NAGPUR: PRINTED AT THE SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1895. [ PRICE EIGHT ANNAS. ]
No. 2525. Exctract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, in the General Department,2 asylums have now omitted Public Works Department charges, while hitherto Jubbulpore alone did so. They should, however, as noted by the Administra- tive Medical Officer, be included in both accounts. 6. The net profits on account of Manufactures were Rs. 750 at Nagpur and Rs. 1,106 at Jubbulpore, against Rs. 531 and Rs. 853 respectively in the preceding year. Special attention has been given to the improvement of the industries in the Nagpur Asylum. The manufacture of cloth has been extended, and that of net money bags and coir mats introduced. The establishment of a dairy farm has also been sanctioned, and is about to be undertaken, and the Superintendent also proposes to start oil-pressing. In Jubbulpore the lunatics cleared and brought under cultivation part of the land recently added to the asylum premises. The information as to the industries in both asylums, and the manner in which the lunatics are employed might, the Chief Commissioner thinks, be given in fuller detail. 7. Both asylums were inspected by the Chief Commissioner during the year. They also had the advantage of visits from the Surgeon-General with the Government of India. The Boards of Visitors met regularly, and gave useful help to the management. The Chief Commissioner is pleased to be able to endorse the Administrative Medical Officer's commendation of the care and ability with which both institutions have been managed, and the special efforts made by Surgeon-Major Harris for the improvement of the Nagpur Asylum. Both the Deputy Superintendents have continued to render excellent service, Mr. Mohan Lal being specially noticed by the Administrative Medical Officer. To Surgeon-Colonel Ross the Chief Commissioner is indebted for the thorough control and searching criticism which have given rise to many useful reforms. ORDER.No. 609-464. FROM SURGEON-COLONEL G. C. ROSS, ADMINISTRATIVE MEDICAL OFFICER, Central Provinces, To THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 14th February 1895. SIR, I have the honour to forward for submission to the Chief Commis- sioner, Central Provinces, the Annual Report and Statements of the Lunatic Asylums in the Central Provinces for the year 1894. 2. Surgeon-Major G. F. A. Harris held charge of the Nagpur Asylum throughout the year, and at Jubbulpore Brigade-Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel J. B. Gaffney was Superintendent until the 22nd October 1894, and Surgeon- Lieutenant-Colonel H. K. McKay for the remainder of the year. ADDITIONS AND ALTERATIONS. 3. At Nagpur the building occupied formerly as the Judicial Commissioner's Court was added to the Asylum premises, and, after necessary alteration, was brought into use in April 1894. A portion of the main ward has been parti- tioned off to serve as an office, and another portion as a surgery and dispensing room. The old office which thus became available has been taken into use as a ward for special cases. As there was no separate dead-house in this Asylum, the latrine of the old Judicial Commissioner's Court has been converted for the purpose. The old wheat grinding room in the female enclosure has been converted into cells, as more accommodation was needed for refractory and violent female lunatics, as well as for non-criminal paying patients. A separate cook-house for these paying patients has also been added. The existing barracks to the east and west have been altered to provide accommodation for European and Eurasian male and female lunatics. This is a new departure, and meets a much felt want. A small shed for boiling the clothes of the lunatics has also been created. Ambajheri water has been laid on for drinking purposes. Pucca drains have been constructed in the enclosures to No. 2 ward. A large masonry tank has been constructed for bathing purposes, and a wall to screen the plat- form where the females bathe. A large number of trees (lime, mango, teak, &c.) have also been planted all over the asylum premises. 4. At Jubbulpore, except the usual annual repairs, there were no altera- tions or additions to the Asylum buildings done by the Public Works Depart- ment. A portion of the piece of ground in front of the Asylum has been brought under cultivation, and arrangements have been made to clean the remaining portion, and it will be brought under cultivation in 1895. The Chief Commis- sioner has approved of the proposals regarding the construction of a ward for Europeans and Eurasians, and also the railing round the Asylum, and the work will be put in hand when funds are available.
2 STATEMENT I. 5. Population.3 STATEMENT II. 13. The number of admissions of criminal lunatics at each Asylum was slightly less than in 1893. At Nagpur there were 12 fresh admissions against 14 in the previous year. At Jubbulpore 6 fresh admissions were made against 8 in the previous year. At the former there were 3 re-admissions, while at the latter there were none. The daily average strength of criminal lunatics in 1894 was higher at Nagpur, it was 58.24 against 51.71 in 1893; and at Jubbulpore it was slightly less, i. e., 33.19 against 33.87 in the preceding year. 14. With reference to paragraph 4 of Government of India Resolution No. 84 TABLE II.5 23. The following table gives the various causes of deaths at both the Asylums:6 26. The sums paid into the Treasury in 1894 by the Superintendents of the two Asylums are given below :7 31. The following table shows the mean cost per head of the patients in the Asylums of the Central Provinces, compared with those of other Provinces:8 Report on the Nagpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1894. STATEMENT No. I. Admissions and discharges. There were 37 admissions into the Asylum during the year, viz. :9 STATEMENT III. Of the 42 admissions10 As a considerable number of these lunatics are " wandering lunatics" with no fixed home, and a further considerable number immigrants from other parts of India, it is very difficult to draw trustworthy conclusions from the numbers coming from any one district, and the figures above given need elaborating. I hope to do this in a future return. STATEMENT IV. Does not need any lengthy comment. The largest number of admissions (9) were from the class of cultivators, and next from the labouring class (6), and the occupation of 8 was unknown. This year I have also given a table showing the previous occupation of the lunatics admitted during the past five years, which also emphasises the above conclusion. I have no doubt that physical privation plays a prominent part, and is an important factor in the causation of much of the insanity seen amongst the agricultural, labouring and begging classes. Table showing the occupation of patients admitted into the Asylum during the years of11 STATEMENT VI. Types of insanity. The following is a short summary of the various types of insanity found to exist amongst those newly admitted :12 The death from fracture of the skull was brought about by a fight between 2 lunatics, Kasim Ali and Akbar Khan, on the 9th June. I was present at the Asylum when the quarrel took place, and saw Akbar Khan shortly after his skull was fractured. The facts of the case are briefly as follows:13 The amount paid into the Treasury for manufactured articles sold, and sale of vegetables and fruits was Rs. 121-14-6 as compared with Rs. 31-11-1 in 1893. The net profit was Rs. 749-9-2 against Rs. 531-8-2 in 1893. During the year the manufacture of cloth has been considerably extended, Rs. 98-2-0 worth have been supplied to the lunatics as clothing, and there is stock in hand worth Rs. 50-12-0 which will be utilised in 1895. The manu- facture of net money bags has also been begun, and also the manufacture of coir mats. An impetus has been given to manufactures of all kinds by the re- transfer in the month of October to the Asylum, from the Central Jail of Nagpur, of a recovered lunatic, by name Bhima, who not only has himself picked up many trades during his time in jail, but what is better, possesses the fortunate knack of imparting his knowledge to others also. I hope soon to start the pressing of linseed oil. It is my intention also to purchase " dhan," or un- husked rice, in the open market at the proper season of the year when it can be bought cheaply, and to husk it in the Asylum. I hope gradually to increase the live-stock on the farm, and to be in a position in a few years to supply the Asylum population with an abundance of pure milk. STATEMENT XII. The following table gives the average cost per lunatic under the various heads during the past 6 years :14 a surgery and dispensing room. The old office has been taken into use as a ward for special cases, contagious or otherwise. The latrine attached to the Judicial Commissioner's Court has been converted into a dead-house; there never has been a dead-house attached to the Asylum, and the want of one has often been felt The old wheat grinding room in the female enclosure has been con- verted into cells, as it was found that more accommodation was needed for re- fractory and violent female lunatics. It has also been found that some private accommodation for non-criminal paying patients was urgently needed, where they could obtain the complete absence of home associations, and the necessary freedom from household worries and the over-anxious attentions of friends and relatives, all of which are so absolutely necessary for successful treatment in many cases of acute mania, which are almost the only cases in whom the prog- nosis may be said to be comparatively favourable; a separate cook-house for these paying patients has also been provided. Accommodation for European and Eurasian male and female lunatics has also been provided by small altera- tions and additions to existing barracks (east and west bungalows). A small shed for boiling the lunatics' clothes has also been erected. Ambajheri water has been laid on for drinking purposes. "Pucca" drains have been constructed in the enclosures to No. 2 ward. The walls of all the wards and cells have been painted 4 feet high with a coating of coal tar. A large masonry tank, 20 feet in length, 3½ feet in breadth and 2½ feet in height, has been constructed near the reservoir for bathing purposes, and a wall to screen the platform where the females bathe. The annual repairs, whitewashing, &c., have been carried out. A great many trees (lime, mango, teak, &c.) have been planted all over the Asylum premises. Surgeon-Major G. F. A. Harris held charge throughout the year. First Class Hospital Assistant Abdul Majid Khan has held the office of De- puty Superintendent throughout the year, and I cannot too strongly bring to notice his conscientious devotion to duty and tactful management of the luna- tics under his care. I have been completely satisfied with his work. S. M. Santio, the clerk and compounder, has also worked well throughout the year. In the month of May he was deputed to the Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylum, with the permission and approval of the Administrative Medical Officer, to en- quire into the working of the Asylum at Jubbulpore for purposes of com- parison with the Nagpur Asylum ; and the knowledge and experience he gained, I trust, will prove of benefit in the future for the Nagpur Asylum. The usual monthly visitors' meetings were held, and the half-yearly meetings on the 12th January and 13th July 1894. The Asylum was inspected by the Chief Commissioner on the 13th November, by the Surgeon-General with the Government of India on the 22nd November, and by the Administra- tive Medical Officer, Central Provinces, on the 30th April, 10th July, 31st July and 22nd November 1894.

15 Report on the Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylum for the year 1894. There were no alterations or additions to the Asylum buildings during the year except the usual annual repairs done by the Public Works Depart- ment. A portion of the piece of ground in the front of the Asylum which was enclosed in 1893 was levelled by the inmates of the Asylum and brought under cultivation, and the remaining portion, which was full of foundations, has been cleaned and levelled, and will be brought under cultivation this year. The wards for European lunatics has been sanctioned, and also the railing round the Asylum, and the work will be put in hand when funds are available. Before the land in front of the Asylum can be properly cultivated the well in the middle will have to be covered, and a few alterations will have to be made. STATEMENT I. This statement shows the total of all lunatics, independent of classification. The total population of the year is higher than that of the preceding year, being 180 (males 142, females 38) against 174 (males 137, females 37) in 1893. The number remaining on the 1st January 1894 was 15016 Of the Central Provinces cases17 Religion and sex18 Suspected Ganja. (1).

The total receipts from the Trea- sury was Rs. 7,914-6-7 against Rs. 8,168-7-11 for the preceding year, showing a decrease of Rs. 254. Column 3 represents the receipts from paying patients Rs. 1,217-13-6 which is obtained by cash receipts from Native States, and this item is steadily increasing yearly. In the year 1892 the Government of India authorized the Lunatic Asylum of Jubbulpore to receive lunatics from the Central India Agencies, its Canton- ments and Native States on payment of their maintenance. In 1893 we received 2 non-criminal lunatics with reception orders signed by a 1st Class Magis- trate, Railway Jurisdiction, Rajputana and Malwa Railway, Indore. The usual half-yearly bills for the maintenance of the above lunatics, for the half-year ending 31st December 1893, were submitted to the Magistrate, and the charges were duly paid by cash. The bills for the half-year ending 30th June 1894 were sent for payment, but the objection was raised by the Comptroller, Indian Treasuries, that no cash payment should be made from the Cantonment and Agency Funds, Central India, as was done before. The correspondence on this subject has been submitted through the Administrative Medical Officer, Central Provinces, for the orders of the Local Government, and is now under considera- tion, I may say that I applied to the Comptroller, Central Provinces, and to the Comptroller, Indian Treasuries, for a copy of the Resolution quoted, but it is not traceable in the office. If we include the Rs. 144 being the cost of the maintenance of these luna- tics, the receipts from paying patients would have been Rs. 1,361-0-0. Column 4 shows the total receipts of stores from the manufacturing depart- ment of the Asylum Rs. 1,078-2-6 as follows, viz.:22 The usual extra Table No. XII is annexed, which shows the comparative cost of maintenance for the past 10 years :23 The following table will show clearly the eums obtained from the Treasury and Asylum on account of expenditure:STATEMENTS.
