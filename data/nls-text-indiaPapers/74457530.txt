Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department. REFERRING to paragraph 8 of the Government of India's Resolu- tion No. 1-136, dated 5th March 1875, Home Department, I am directed to forward herewith copy of a summary, furnished by the Sanitary Commissioner with this Government, of reports submitted by officers of the Indian Medical Department on the distribution and causation of leprosy in the Bombay Presidency. No. 116, dated Bombay, the 7th January 1878.  From-G. HEWLETT, Esq., Acting Sanitary Commissioner, Bombay. To-The Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay. WITH reference to your memorandum No. 4014, dated 19th December 1876, regarding the prevalence of leprosy in the Presidency, I have the honour to express my regret at the delay that has taken place in answering it, which has arisen solely from the fact that during the past year I have been engaged almost solely in superintending the operations in the famine districts. For the same reason I have been unable myself to institute any personal enquiry into the matter, and can now only forward a summary of the reports of the different Civil Surgeons which have been forwarded to me by Government. The accompanying table shews the population of each Registration District, and the number of lepers that were returned at the time of the census of 1872 who were living in each district. I do not suppose that these returns are very accurate, but they indicate fairly the relative number of lepers found in each district: Districts. Population according census of 1872.

?(2) From the above it will be seen that the highest rate to population is found in Khandeish, and next to it in Ahmednagar, whilst in the Puna, Sholapur, Satara and Dharwar Districts which are situated above the Ghats, and in the Ratnagiri and Kolaba Collectorates on the sea coast, the ratio to population is high. In the other districts the disease appears to be proportionally less, the least number being returned from the Province of Sind. I quite concur in the opinion expressed by the Government of India that any measures of segragation and medical treatment of lepers throughout the country would be impracticable as a State measure, but I do hold that the improvement of the hygienic conditions under which the mass of the people live is the only sure method of stamping out leprosy or any similar disease. The filth with which all the villages in India are surrounded is quite sufficient to prevent any hope of success in combating the disease, which it is not difficult to foresee, will prevail until such an objectionable state of matters is altered. With these preliminary remarks I proceed to furnish a summary of the returns received from the various Civil Surgeons as furnished by the Surgeon General: KHANDIESH. The Civil Surgeon, Dhulia, records the following notes of the only case of leprosy treated by gurjun oil, which he was able to watch for a length of time. The history of this case does not in his opinion support the character of the remedy as a permanent cure for the disease: Khandu wullud Rama, a Coonbee, aged 25, with a rather fair skin, came into the Dhulia Jail on the 6th January 1876, with well-developed tubercular leprosy, and was treated by gurjun oil administered internally and applied externally as a liniment. Under treatment the ulceration of the tips of the fingers and toes and on several other parts of the hands and feet, and the severe cracks on the soles of the latter perfectly healed in two months, and the tumefaction of the face much diminished; his general condition also having changed from one of great repulsiveness to comparative health. The ansthe- sia was not however appreciably diminished. During these two months he gained three pounds in weight, which does not seem much, considering that he did no work and was fairly well fed on the usual prison ration with wheat, bread and 8 oz. mutton. This amelioration of the disease was not, however, altogether permanent, and before his release from jail on the 23rd January 1876 he was again suffering from the sores though they were not so serious as on his arrival. NASIK. The Honorary Surgeon Nasik states that no cases of leprosy were treated at the Nasik Hospital during the 23 months from November 1874 to September 1876 inclusive. AHMEDNAGAR. According to the report furnished by the Civil Surgeon, Ahmednagar, eighteen out-patients and two in-patients affected by leprosy were admitted into the hospital during 1875-76. Some of the out-patients who attended the hospital regularly for treatment slowly recovered under the use of gurjun oil; but after sometime they discontinued their coming to the hospital for treatment. One of the in-pa- tients was admitted into the hospital on 5th and died on 20th October 1875. He was seriously ill when he was brought to the hospital, and could not properly speak. The other in-patient was admitted on the 8th September 1875, and he went home of his own accord on 20th December 1875. He was much improved under treat- ment by gurjun oil. Of the twenty cases mentioned above, seventeen are said to have got the disease after they had attained the age of puberty; but their ancestors were said to have been entirely free from the disease. The remaining three cases are reported to have inherited the disease from their grandfathers. PUNA. The Acting Civil Surgeon, Puna, states his inability to furnish any report on leprosy cases treated at the Sassoon Hospital, owing to there being no accom- modation set apart for the treatment of lepers in that hospital. No report seems to have been received from the Assistant Surgeon in charge Khan Bahadur Padamji Sorabji's Charitable Dispensary, Puna.
?(3) SATARA. The report of Dr. P. Colson, Acting Civil Surgeon, Satara, is not to be found among the papers received from Government. No further report received from Satara. SHOLAPUR. The Civil Surgeon, Sholapur, says that, owing to the rare prevalence of leprosy in the district, he had had but very few opportunities of treating cases of that disease, and is unable, therefore, to submit a report of any value on the subject. BELGAUM. The report of Dr. Hughes, Civil Surgeon, Belgaum, on the gurjun oil treat- ment for leprosy, said to have been forwarded by that officer to the Deputy Surgeon General, Indian Medical Department, Puna, dated 28th May 1876, is not to be found among the papers received from Government. DHARWAR. Report not received. KALADGHI. No leprosy cases were treated in the Kaladghi Civil Hospital during 1875-76. KANARA. Only one case of leprosy seems to have been treated in the Karwar Civil Hospital during the earlier part of the year 1876. According to the Civil Sur- geon, Karwar, the disease does not appear to be prevalent in the district. The late census of the district shewed 158 cases of leprosy; but the Civil Surgeon doubts whether there were even half this number. The Natives, he says, call every chronic skin disease (such as psoriasis) leprosy. No valuable information is obtainable owing to the rarity in the district of the diseases mentioned by Dr. Fox. RATNAGIRI. History furnished of 27 lepers treated in the Dinshaw Maneckji Petit Leper Hospital at Ratnagiri. Of these as many as 15 or 5555 per cent. were found among people inhabiting the sea-shore within one or two miles' distance from the coast line of the district. Of the remaining 12, the following is the distri- bution : Number of cases. Distance of the place inhabited by lepers from the sea-coast.  3 Between       3 and         10              miles 7 Do.  10 do. 20 do. 1 Do.  20 do. 30 do. 1 Do. 30 do. 40 do. Of the total number treated, 15 were cultivators by profession, 7 beggars, 2 sailors, 1 fisherman, 1 oilman, and 1 ordinary servant. Three of these cases occurred among Muhammadans and the remaining 24 among Hindus. All were fish eaters. All males. The wives of 12 of these contracted this disease after their marriage. Twelve of the patients were unmarried. None of the patients had any relatives suffering from the leprosy. Only 1 leper, a Mahar, Hindu cultivator, has, however, 1 leprous child. The various forms of leprosy were as under-                                                                    No. Tuberculated (lepara nodosa)                      ...    10 Ansthetic    ( do.    nervosa)                      ...    13 Mixed (lepra nodosa and nervosa) ...      3 Lepra leprosa                                           ...      1                                                  Total            ...      27
?( 4 ) All Muhammadan lepers were of the tubercular type, and none of long stand- ing. Of the Hindu cases, 1 was of 30 years' standing, 1 of 25, 1 of 20, 9 of between 10 and 20, and the rest below 10. The first case was that of a Koolwadi beggar, the second of a Mahar beggar, and the third of Mahar cultivator. Only 1 case is reported to have had syphilis 5 years before his admission into the hospital. KOLABA, BOMBAY CITY, AND TANNA. No reports received. SURAT. History available of only 2 cases treated in 1875. Commencement of the disease in the case of the first about 5 and in that of the second 3 years ago. Both are married; the first having three children, of whom the youngest is 1 year old, and the second having a daughter aged 20 years. Both are coolie labourers. Both, though not particularly well nourished, had yet a sufficiency of food. Their usual diet is fish, rice (respectively nagli and jowari), bread, dall, and vegetables. The first smokes and drinks but takes no opium. The disease of both has no hereditary history. The lungs, heart, liver and spleen of both, and the kidneys of the second, are healthy. The urine in the first case is normal. The second has a deficiency of tone at both apices, notwithstanding his quiet and equal respiration. The first man suffers from a complete ansthesia of the arms and hands up to the shoulders, and is insensible to touch only in the legs, the feet and the ears. He has perfect taste, hearing, sight and smell. The veins of the lower limbs are swollen; in fact almost varicose. The veins of the fore-arms and hands are also swollen a little, and the skin of the ansthetic parts is more or less wrinkled. There is an ulcer partially healed on the left hip. The original size of the ulcer is about 3 inches in circumference, and the unhealed portion is about as large as a pea. Another partially healed ulcer exists on the outer front of the left knee about 1/2 inch in circumference. The left foot from about 2 inches above the malleolus is a good deal swollen. There is a small ulcer below the inner ankle and scar just in front of the ankle. The big toe is swollen and much ulcerated. The bone of the last phalanx is destroyed, but the nail remains. There is a larger ulcer in the cleft between the first and second toes. The little toe is gone, but the ulceration is healed. The three other toes are swollen. The toes of the other foot are some- what swollen, and there is a small partially healed ulcer on the outer ankle. Sexual capacity and inclination are apparently lessened, and the right testicle is shrunken. The second man has no ansthetic disease, but has a depression at the bridge of the nose, with a hole in its centre, caused, as the sufferer asserts, by an insect getting into his nose while asleep, and afterwards giving birth to maggots. There are no signs of syphilitic affection unless the ulceration of the nose is one. The five fingers of the left hand has been ulcerated but are now healed, leaving considerable deformity. The skin of the right extremity from elbow to wrist is black and shrivelled, and the muscles wasted. The wrist is almost destroyed by ulceration, and the hand is separated by ulceration from the wrist, being merely attached by pieces of diseased skin and the remains of tendons. There is an ulcer on the palm of the hand, and the little finger is quite gone. There is an ulcer on each hip about the size of a crown piece; of the last mentioned two ulcers, the first is partially healed and the second supperating. The second toe of the left foot is ulcerated, and the big toe entirely destroyed. There are other ulcerated places on both legs. Sexual inclination is impaired. The first patient was for about seventeen days after his admission treated with chalmogra oil with ordinary diet, milk and mutton. Under this treatment some improvement was soon observable. In the left lower extremity over a limited space on the inner aspect of the thigh and from the lower part of the gluteal region downwards, some sensation was felt. It was also felt on some portions of the inner side of the leg. The right leg felt lighter and was somewhat more sensi- ble to touch. The upper extremities of the fingers except the palms and palmar surface were, however, entirely insensible. The chalmogra oil was then discon- tinued, and gurjun oil given instead. Under this treatment, sensation returned partially in the right upper extremity. The inner part of the arm was sensitive to touch, while a great part of the back of the arm and only a limited space in front of the deltoid still remained devoid of sensation. A limited portion of the right fore-arm (palmar aspect) from the elbow joint to within three inches of the wrist was sensitive. This treatment continued for about a week, and sensation became apparent in the left upper extremity above the elbow generally. There was no sensation below the elbow except on the palm and palmar aspect of the fingers.
?(5) The lower extremeties, viz., the back of the thighs and legs (except the lower 4th of the latter and the feet) recovered somewhat their sensitiveness. The ulcer on the left hip remained unhealed, but the one on the knee disappeared. Two plates, one of zinc and the other of copper, 61/2 inches, were then applied to the left fore-arm, and united by a strip of copper, so that a bandage could be passed under the upper hand. The plates were bandaged close to the arm, and then covered with about one inch thickness of cotton also bandaged over arm and plates. These plates were kept for about five days, during which time gurjun oil was being constantly administered. Under this treatment the only portion of the left fore-arm that remained insensitive was the back of the hand from the wrist to the metacarpus and a strip about an inch in width from the elbow to the wrist. The arm was somewhat painful and sore, but not to any extent. The ulcer on the hip was a little improved. No other change. The plates were then applied in a similar manner to the other fore-arm. The effect on this arm was more severe, and the plates had to be removed after about three days owing to the patient's complaining of pain. The arm was then found to be a good deal swollen and painful, but sensation, though not quite perfect, existed all over the arm. The patient then refused to allow the plates to be put on again and was discharged at his own request. The improvement that had been obtained remained up to the date of his discharge. The medical officer concludes by expressing his opinion that a galvanic bath may prove of benefit in cases of ansthetic leprosy not too far advanced. The second patient was treated with chalmogra oil, which produced a very slight improvement in some of the ulcers. The patient, however, left the hospital declining to be treated any further. BROACH. History furnished of 6 cases of leprosy who were neither in nor out-patients at the Broach Civil Hospital- 1st Case.-Hindu, caste Bhungi, occupation sweeper, age 45, residence Broach. The disease is attributed to contagion, as one of the neighbours of the sufferer and of the same caste laboured under it. The leper says he was quite free from leprosy until he associated with this man and took dinner, &c., with him. Leprous before marriage. No other leprous case in the family. The living of the caste generally bad, as they use all sorts of flesh of animals and fowls which have died from natural causes. Married when 20 years old. Had one son who died at 5 years of age from cholera. Ansthetic leprosy of 15 years' standing. States he had first gonorrha, then syphillis, and lastly leprosy. Has lost 1st and 2nd phalanges of all his fingers; toes of the right foot atrophied, those of the left commencing to be so. 2nd Case.-A Hindu, resident of Broach, aged 40, disease hereditary, as both his father and his eldest brother, now dead, were lepers. Ansthetic leprosy. Has lost the great toe of the left foot and the second toe of the right one. Has a large ulcer on the sole of the left foot and has lost two phalanges of the little finger of the left hand. 3rd Case.-A coolie, Bhil, aged 35, inhabitant of village Manmar, 12 miles distant from Broach. Ansthetic leprosy. Has lost fingers and toes and has caries of nasal bones. The bridge of nose has flattened. Has been suffering from leprosy 8 years. Mother a leper. Has been married 10 years, but no disease transmitted to his wife or children. 4th Case.-Also a Bhil, aged 14, first cousin of the 3rd case. Leprosy ans- thetic and incipient, just commencing in fingers of both hands and also in his toes. His father perfectly free from leprosy. His father's sister is, however, a leper. 5th Case.-A Bhil cultivator, aged 35, now a beggar, inhabitant of village Madode. Ansthetic leprosy. Has lost fingers and toes. Has been affected 6 years; was well when he married. Had two children who died, but cannot say from what causes. Mother a leper. Wife not a leper, nor any other member of the family. Wife left him on discovery of her husband's disease. 6th Case.-A Mussalman labourer, aged 25, and an inhabitant of Broach Town. Ansthetic leprosy. Joints of fingers of both hands deformed. Depres- sion of the nose and shining tubercular appearance of the fore-fingers and toes. Duration of suffering 12 years. General health good. Married. Has no issue. Father not a leper, but grandfather was.
(6) KAIRA. The cases generally treated at the Kaira Civil Hospital are those of tinea and leprosy. Two cases of fibroma casually seen by the Civil Surgeon, in whose opinion, however, the disease is very uncommon in the district. Leucoderma is common, but its subjects do not present themselves for treatment. PANCH MAHALS. No skin diseases worthy of note present in Dohad. Leprosy reports said to have been sent in, but not found among the papers received from the Government. Lepers, says Dr. Jones, attend the hospital a few times, and then discontinue their attendance, so that no satisfactory information can be procured. AHMEDABAD. The Civil Surgeon, Ahmedabad, offers the following remarks on the sub- ject: Mycetoma seldom presents itself in its incipient stage. It is restricted to the soft parts of the plantar surface of the foot, and is generally found to be prevalent among the agricultural population, chiefly herdsmen, who come almost entirely from the neighbouring Province of Kattywar. As regards the parasitic or non-parasitic nature of the disease, it is generally believed that the disease never occurs without an external wound having pre-existed, generally the result of a prick from a thorn through which the parasite, whatever be its nature, enters the skin. Of the 2 varieties of this disease, the black and the white or rose coloured, the former is more common. Amputation is the only remedy in chronic cases, and probably excision in the recent and circumscribed stages. As regards leprosy it is seldom met with in its early stages. Careful treat- ment by gurjun oil has quite failed to relieve far less to cure it. Nutritious food has done more in this direction than any of the remedies employed as far as can be ascertained, the cases of hereditary leprosy far exceed those which are idiopathic or acquired, and a large number of cases are due to syphilis. The disease known as the Delhi Sore is met with both among the rich and the poor, and among Europeans as well as Natives, and has of late been on the decrease, probably owing to better sanitary arrangements, purer water and the advance of cultivation. Cases of elephantiasis are very rarely met with, as only eight cases were treated during the last five years. Filaria medinensis is not very frequently met with at Ahmedabad probably from the fact that river water is chiefly used for bathing. Out of a total number of 13,195 cutaneous diseases, only 165 of this disease were treated during the last five years. Cases of leucoderma are not infrequent in the City of Ahmedabad, but it seldom happens that persons suffering from it apply for treatment. This disease, it is believed, occurs more generally among Natives of comparatively fair skin. Psoriasis is not a disease of common occurrence in the district. Scabies is very prevalent, especially in the young. It is more rarely met with in adults. Of the two diseases-tinea tonsurans and tinea favosa-the former is more prevalent than the latter. Carbuncle does not occur in large numbers. It is generally found to be a very intractable disease, and in several cases has proved fatal from the extreme depression it induced, and from the want of proper instruments. The remarks of the Assistant Surgeon in charge Bechardas Dispensary are very much to the same effect. SIND. (Kurrachee, Hyderabad, Thar and Parkar, Shikarpur and Upper Sind Frontier.) Generally speaking, leprosy cases are very rarely met with in Sind. In most of the few cases hitherto observed in the various hospitals and dispensaries in that Province, the sufferers were foreigners, often mendicants from the Punjab, Cabul, Khorassan, Samarkand and Bokhara. These were probably all males, although no
(7) such record was kept at the Sakkar Dispensary in Shikarpur. The five or six cases treated at Kotri during the year 1875-76 were all of the tubercular variety, a low form of cachexia, and were all more or less attended by loss of sensibility. In all cases the parts affected were the legs and feet, and in one case there was the loss of sexual power. A prisoner at the Kurrachee Jail, who suffered from this disease, was a native of the territory beyond the Hubb. He had lost some parts of his hands and feet previous to his incarceration. He was treated with large doses of iodide of potassium with much marked benefit. According to the opinion of the Civil Surgeon, Kurrachee, Natives often call men lepers who are merely suffering from leucoderma or from psoriasis or from leprosa vulgaris. KOLHAPUR. No reports received, although one is said to have been sent in. DEESA. Very few cases of dermal affection; no leprosy. MHOW. No leprosy cases reported, skin diseases very rare, and those too mostly itch. BARODA. No leprosy in the regiment. Many interesting skin diseases may be seen at the Civil Hospital, but of this no report. MEHIDPUR. No cases of leprosy to be found in the neighbourhood. NEEMUCH. 24th Regiment, Native Infantry, no leprosy. 3rd Queen's Own Light Cavalry. The Surgeon Major attached to this Corps states that the whole of the statistics of the disease in Rajputana and Central India are in the hands of the Presidency Surgeons of those Governments and the Civil Surgeons. In the Cantonment of Neemuch only two military cases were met with; two or three paupers come into camp on Sundays for alms, but the medical officer is not aware as to whether the disease is prevalent in the neighbourhood. The two military cases were in men from Hindustan. Both somewhat improved by the use of gurjun oil administered both internally and externally. RAJKOT. Mycetoma prevails to a considerable extent in Kattywar and Cutch. During the last ten years 183 cases were admitted into the Civil Hospital, Rajkot, of whom 129 underwent amputation and 18 excision, mostly of the foot Cases of the pale or ochroid variety rarely occur, and the black variety is more prevalent. The origin of the disease is obscure, and when the patient first discovers it, it is the swelling usually situate in the sole at the base of the toes, having a peculiar nodulated appearance, and the cuticle being thickened and presenting the appearance of a corn. Attention is generally attracted to the existence of the disease by getting the diseased part hurt against a stone or by the pricking of a thorn. The disease while in this state can be easily removed by excising the entire swelling with the skin, its extent being clearly defined. It consists of a fibrous capsule having no communication with the exterior; this being laid open, discloses black particles like grains of gun-powder which afterwards develop into the mice dung granules. If the disease does not extend beyond this fibrous capsule, the wound will heal by granulation and the disease be removed. Dr. Bloomfield says he sent two interesting specimens of this disease, which were of the size of a chestnut, to the Curator of the Grant Medical College Museum, but that he never heard of them after, nor did he discover them in the Museum when he visited it afterwards. Should the disease be not removed in this early stage, it increases slowly with but little pain, and sooner or later an opening is established, mostly on the dorsal aspect of the foot, which discharges sanious pus, and, later on some of the
(8) characteristic granules. In this stage of the disease whole or partial amputation of the foot is the only resource. In these partial amputations if care is taken to remove all the diseased structure, a cure is effected; but should any of the disease remain, it extends rapidly. Its extirpation by escharotics is doubtful. In an advanced stage of the disease which proceeds slowly, many fistulous openings form in the foot, discharging a fetid pus, and the patient dies of exhaustion. The structure of the foot is found to be completely altered. The muscles and bones have completely disappeared, and their place is supplied by a fibro- cartilaginous structure, which can be divided with a scalpel, and the shaft of the tibia will be hollowed, not containing any osseous structure, except as a shell on the surface. This condition will extend to the knee joint and even to the femur. The disease is almost always unilateral, although in one case it recurred in the right foot of a man, who said that his left foot was amputated 12 years before for the same disease. The progress of the ochroid variety appears to be the same as that of the black variety. The Civil Surgeon believes the nature of the disease to be parasitic, but is unable to say how its germ comes in that situation, or whether it is of vegetable origin. Leprosy prevails to a considerable extent in the Province, and is universally considered to be hereditary, and it is also considered to be acquired by associating with lepers. The pensioned Hospital Assistant, formerly in charge of the Leper Asylum, Rajkot, is inclined to the belief that the disease has been increasing of late, but no trustworthy statistics in proof of this are forthcoming. Leucoderma prevails amongst Natives of fair complexion, especially the Parsis and sometimes amongst Europeans. Many varieties of ring-worm exist in the country. There are two forms of prickly-heat (lichen tropicus),-Ezema solaris, which is caused by excessive sweating in a moist atmosphere, is cured spontaneously by a cooler atmosphere; and lichen tropicus or nettle-rash caused by obstructed perspira- tion, which is aggravated by a dessicating atmosphere and sun, also by a stimulating and indigestible diet. It prevails even in the cold weather. The pellagra form of the disease is unknown. NUSSEERABAD. No cases of leprosy or any other skin disease reported. D. N. M.-Home, Rev. & Agri, Dept.

THE orders of Government above quoted were to the effect that the Sanitary Commissioners of Local Governments should, with the assistance of the Civil Surgeons, collect all facts bearing on the distribution and causation of leprosy ; the principal facts to be noticed and recorded being-1st, the extent to which leprosy exists in each district ; 2nd, if localized, the locality in which it is chiefly found ; 3rd, the peculiarities of this locality, if any, and the conditions in other respects under which the people therein live ; 4th, the circumstances under which individual cases seem to have arisen, whether by contagion or hereditary taint, or from any other cause. 2. As a reliable foundation for this investigation, I have, during the past year, been engaged, in regard to this subject, in collecting, with the assistance of the Civil Surgeons, histories of leprosy cases from every district of the Province. The history in every case being a record of facts in the following form : Present history.-Name, age, sex, caste, present place of abode, form of leprosy suffered, present means of livelihood. Previous history.-Place of abode when first attacked with leprosy, age when first attacked, employment or means of livelihood when first attacked. Family history.-State of health during life of grandfathers and grandmothers, father and mother, uncles or aunts, brothers and sisters, as regards leprosy. If married, state of health of husband and wife as regards leprosy. Period of cohabi- tation since one was attacked. Number of children born of the marriage, number now living, number attacked with leprosy, 3. I am now in possession of the complete histories, as above, of 1,531 cases of leprosy, gathered from all parts of the Province, as shown in the following statement : Division. District.

(2) Excepting in the cases of Mainpuri and Kumaun, the history statements received from all other districts were prepared by the Civil Surgeons immediately after examina- tion of the persons named as suffering from leprosy-the facts, as elicited at the time of examination, being at once recorded, and often in the handwriting of the Civil Sur- geon. The history statements from Kumaun were prepared by the Superintendent of the Leper Asylum at Almora. The history statements from Mainpuri, numbering 472, and taking account of all the lepers in the district known to the police, were prepared by the district civil authorities. 4. My request, in regard to this matter, was for a minimum of 30 histories from each district, hoping to encourage willingness for the work, and consequent accuracy, by asking little. But I need scarcely say I should have welcomed a more extended series of histories, even to a record in like form of every known case of leprosy in the Province. The record from Mainpuri seems to have been well effected, and recogni- tion of this self-imposed task-evidence of willing interest in the work-is certainly due to the Magistrate. Undoubtedly, the possession of a history of every known case would have permit- ted the establishment of fixed conclusions in regard to all points in this investigation, and an addition of finality and perfection might have been impressed on the work I have to do in this direction, could my report have had an extended information like that for foundation. Yet I think it is likely that, by a careful consideration of the 1,531 cases collected, the principal facts, in regard to this matter, may be clearly enunciated, and a satisfac- tory answer provided to the enquiries propounded by the Government of India. 5. In regard to the extent to which leprosy exists in each district. This can be answered, perhaps satisfactorily, by quoting the figures of the census re- port of this Province for 1872, as concerns this subject. For, amongst many important facts recorded in Mr. Plowden's admirable census report, the number of persons re- turned as lepers in each district has a place. In the succeeding statement, to the number of lepers living in each district in 1871, I add the district population and the resulting ratio of lepers to each thousand of population: Division.  District. Population. Number of Lepers in 1872. Ratio of lepers to  1,000 of population. Division. District. Population. Number of Lepers in 1872. Ratio of lepers to 1,000 of population.

Provinces 30,769,056  10,099  0.328 From this statement it appears that the disease is present in all districts, the greatest prevalence existing in the Himalaya country of Grhwal and Kumaun and the trans-Jumna district of Bnda. 6. It seems very likely, however, that, although the record of the census, as regards this matter, may be accepted as a trustworthy guide to the relative preva- lence of the disease in the different portions of the Province, it does not correctly state the actual number of cases in existence in 1872. For example, in the Main- puri District the census records 94 persons affected with leprosy there, whilst the nominal roll I possess gives a detailed account of 472 cases existing in that district in 1875. In Etah a numerical abstract of cases of leprosy known to the police in that district provides a total of 653 lepers, while the census total is only 387. A nominal roll of lepers in the Agra District in my possession shows a total of 530 lepers in that district, against a total of 320 in the census report; and the Civil Surgoon of Gorakhpur estimates the number of lepers at many hundreds in that district-the census statement is 465.
?( 3 ) It may, I think, be reasonably supposed that many persons afflicted with the disease concealed the fact at the time of the census. And the probable conclusion is, that throughout the Province considerably more than 10,099 persons afflicted with leprosy are in existence. That the total number of cases is likely to be greater, is further shown by a comparison of results recorded in regard to other countries where leprosy prevails. Thus, Dr. H. V. Carter records a ratio of 120 per 1,000 of popu- lation in Norway, and estimates the ratio in the Bombay Presidency to be rather under 1 per 1,000. The ratio arrived at by the help of the census figures in the North-Western Provinces is 0-33 per 1,000. 7. Although it may be accepted as absolutely true that leprosy is most preva- lent amongst the inhabitants of Kumaun, Garhwl and Bnda, yet all the evidence I have been able to collect points to the fact that no portion of these districts can be de- fined as the special home of leprosy. And the same remark holds good of all districts. It is true that many cases of the disease may be found, at one place, in all parts of the Province, because lepers congregate where they can best gain a livelihood by begging ; or, when Hindus, at places where, after death, their remains may without difficulty be put into the Ganges. But, as a rule, the homes, or places of first at- tack of these people, are widespread throughout the district to which they belong. There are, however, exceptions to this rule, as will appear hereafter. 8. In illustration of this point, I proceed to investigate the facts as recorded in the 1,531 histories, and I find that the original homes, or places of first attack, in these 1,531 cases were situated in 960 different centres of population, in accordance with the following list :  Number of  Number of  centres of  centres of District or country. population in which one or District or country. population in which one or  more cases  more cases  originated.  originated.

And this fact is made further plain by a con- sideration of the numerical abstract received from Etah, which records the existence of 653 cases in that district, distributed as follows : Names of police circles.

(4) 9. On this point, too, I am able to quote the opinion of some medical officers who have, in addition to the history statements, favoured me with concise reports on the subject of leprosy. Dr. Jones, of Sahranpur, is of opinion that leprosy in that district is pretty equally distributed, and is not due to local causes. Dr. Thomas, of Bnda, states that the disease prevails principally in four widely-separated pergunnahs, which have no special peculiarities characteristic of them. Dr. Prentis, of Gorakhpur, records the opinion that, although leprosy is rather frequent in that district, it does not occur in one part more than another. Dr. Hooper, of Benares, records the opinion that the disease is not localized in that district. 10. Yet, to this general rule of extended prevalence, something of exception appears as the result of this investigation, which should be stated here. By careful consideration of the histories provided, it appears that leprosy may be unusually prevalent in some centres of population. There is nothing to show that this is due to local causes; but so far as this limited enquiry goes, it seems likely that if there are any especial leprosy-producing centres of population in this Pro- vince, they may be pointed out in the following statement: District.

?( 5) 11. It may be observed of the above list, that many of the places where the disease appears to arise most frequently are populous cities, and the greatness of the population may account for the unusual number of cases originating therein, peculiarity of locality having nothing to do with the prevalence. But this line of argument will not account for the undue prevalence of leprosy in a village of small population, as, for example, in Parsan in Jalaun. It is certainly not impossible that even in the case of a small village, leprosy commencing there may in every case be due to hereditary taint. But as this enquiry proceeds, evidence of a commence- ment of the disease " de novo" in some individuals will appear, and it seems not un- likely that the conditions under which this untoward circumstance arises, may be profitably studied amongst the lepers of a small village. This I purpose doing when opportunity occurs. In regard to Parsan, I may add that the Civil Surgeon of Jalaun attributes the undue prevalence of leprosy there to the filthy state of the village, and to general insanitary conditions surrounding the inhabitants. 12. Leprosy, as it appears in this Province, seems to be a diseased condition much more prevalent amongst men than women. The census statement is 8,160 male and 1,939 female lepers existing in the Province in 1872-about four males to one female. Of 2,155 cases of which I have the particulars of sex-namely 1,502 in the histories and 653 in the Etah numerical abstract-1,966 are cases of males and 189 cases of females-about ten males to one female. This latter estimate may be in excess of the truth, because, for the purpose of examination, it is more likely that males would present themselves ; yet, taking the case of the two districts-Mainpuri and Etah-with their full record of all existing lepers, I find that, out of 1,125 cases, 1,067 are male and 58 female-about eighteen males to one female. Altogether, there cannot, I think, be a doubt that the male constitution, or the circumstances of male life, are peculiarly favourable to the development of the leprous condition. 13. Of the 2,155 cases above-mentioned, 244 are cases of Muhammadans and 1,911 cases of Hindus-or about eight Hindus to one Muhammadan. As the ratio of population is rather more than six Hindus to one Muhammadan, this would seem, to show a preponderance of Hindu lepers, but not to such extent as to pro- vide ground for the consideration of leprosy as specially a disease of Hindus. Rather, I think, for all practical purposes, it may be considered a disease equally of Muhammadans and Hindus. Nor, indeed, are Christians exempt; for Dr. Fitzgerald, of Shhjahnpur, records three cases of leprosy in Europeans resident in India which have come to his knowledge-one the case of a lad, son of a warrant officer at Agra; the second, the case of a lady ; the third, the case of a Colonel in the Indian Service. And amongst the cases reported from Meerut is one of a Native Chris- tian employed in the Mission there, who first suffered from the disease at Mussooree. And, I think, it may be concluded that there is nothing in religion, or habits resulting therefrom, conducive to leprosy, 14. In regard to employment, the habits and circumstances arising therefrom, a very complete account is given in the histories, of the employment or means of livelihood of each individual at the time of first attack, and the account carefully summarized provides the following results :   Number   Number   so em-   so em-  Employment. ployed at   Employment. ployed at    time of   time of   first   first Number.   attack.

(6) Prom this account it appears that the disease is not specially prevalent amongst men of any one form of employment. Indeed, I think it not unlikely the ratios, of cases recorded, to the totals of persons existing in the Province of each form of employ- ment mentioned in the list, would, if the figures were available, be found pretty equal. If any undue prevalence were discoverable, it would probably appear amongst the class employed as bankers; shopkeepers and traders. 15. The same remark applies to castes. The castes of those afflicted with leprosy recorded in the 1,531 histories are rather more numerous than the employments of the above list, and the caste list teaches decidedly that caste has no influence on the prevalence of the disease. The caste list and the employment list are, indeed, very much alike in regard to what may be learnt from them, and I have preferred to give the list of employments as more generally understandable and more pertinent to the enquiry on hand. 16. The list of employment points plainly to one fact of importance, namely, the pretty equal prevalence of leprosy amongst the poor, or those who have to struggle for the necessaries of life, and the rich, or those who possess the necessaries of life with certainty. Estimating two-thirds of the cultivators as poor, a high ratio, for many were returned as farmers, the list of those who may have had to struggle for the neces- saries of life will be- Cultivators 368 Labourers 210 Beggars 68 Weavers 50 Potters 20 Sweepers 15 Total 731 Leaving a balance of 800 persons, of whom at least 315-namely, 117 bankers, shopkeepers and traders; 72 soldiers, servants and officials; 68 supported by relatives; 42 landlords; 12 priests; 4 goldsmiths-must have been living in fairly affluent circumstances, and the remaining 485 were most likely placed above want of any important character by the practice of their professions or employments. Probably, by the law of ratios it might be shown that leprosy is a disease unduly prevalent amongst those who lead a sedentary life. But the facts of the list suffice to prove that the disease afflicts alike the cultivator or labourer of open air life with hard fare, and the bania or merchant of sedentary habits and ample nourishment. 17. The previous list, as the heading shows, provides a statement of employ- ment at the time leprosy first appeared in the individuals concerned. I think it is a point of some importance to determine how these people were employed, or what means of livelihood they possessed at the time of examination, in most cases, many years after they were first afflicted; and the following statement provides the neces- sary information :   Number. Employment or means of livelihood. Number so em- ployed at time of exami- nation. Number. Employment or means of livelihood. Number so em- ployed at time of exami- nation.

?( 7 ) And it appears that about one third of all those afflicted have drifted into beggary. Indeed, if to the total of 496 beggars the 80 persons supported by rela- tions or friends, and the three prisoners are added, the ratio of persons dependent on charity will be nearly 38 per cent, of the total afflicted. This deplorable result is to be expected, of course, in a lingering condition of disease which, in its aggravated form, destroys the hands and feet and otherwise renders the sufferer unfit to labour. 18. Yet, the list of persons still able to support themselves is a goodly one and provides undeniable evidence that so long as a leper can work, there is little or no prejudice in this country against his employment in his special line of business or profession, and this not in cases so slight as to be easily concealed from the general public. 19. In illustration of these points, I record two typical cases, received from Muzaffarnagar-one of the man reduced to beggary, the other of a man who supports himself as a grain-seller. " The case of Kesri, 30 years of age, a beggar, was formerly a gardener. The whole body insensible, marks of accidental burns on the left hip and shoulder, felt no pain when burnt. The palms of the hands without fingers, all the toes of the feet dropped off and healed, a large ulcer on the ball of the left great toe." " The case of Dewan, aged 45, grain-seller in the bazaar : patches of discoloura- tion with ansthesia over the whole body. The right index finger hypertro- phied. The fingers of the left hand contracted. Both feet swollen, and a large ulcer over the balls of the toes of the left foot." 20. I could quote many such cases in support of the opinion that lepers do not find themselves denied the means of livelihood while able to work. They may be shunned by their relations and caste people as disgracefully afflicted or unpleasant, but do not apparently lose caste, or find the general public unwilling to buy of them, or employ them, because of their suffering condition. And, when a leper becomes a beggar, it is, as a rule, by reason of his having fallen into a helpless condition as the disease advances. Even leper prostitutes, apparently, are not debarred from gaining a livelihood by the practice of their calling. 21. I think from these facts it may be gathered that the people of this country, as the result of experience, do not believe in any contagious nature of leprosy. 22. The ages of the 1,531 persons of the histories appear in the following state- ment, and to these I am able to add the ages of 47 lepers recorded in the Agra City nominal roll : Age at date of examination. Age. Age not 5 to 10 10 to 20  20 to 30 30 to 40 40 to 50 50 to 60 60 to 70 Above 70 Total. Remarks.  stated. years. years. years. years. years. years. years. years.

Of the 50 persons more than 70 years old, 29 are returned as between 70 and 75, 2 from 75 to 80, 14 from 80 to 85, 3 from 85 to 90, and 2 from 90 to 95. It is likely that these latter figures are in excess of the actual facts. But still the evidence of age, as a whole, goes to prove undoubtedly that to suffer from leprosy does not forbid the expectation of long life. 23. The age at time of first appearance of the complaint is a fact perhaps of greater importance than the age at the time of examination, and the following is the statement, as compiled from the histories recorded and from the nominal roll of 530 lepers of the Agra City and Agra District, in which the age at time of attack is recorded :

Total 3 5 12 34 280 500 611 406 210 2,061    The table shows that 838 per cent. of those examined were more than 20 years old, that is, well advanced beyond the age of puberty before the disease attacked them ; and 595 per cent, were more than 30 years old, or long past the age of active fertility. Of the 210 persons of more than 50 years of age previous to attack, 185 were between 50 and 60, 12 between 60 and 70, and 13 between 70 and 80, so that leprosy, it is seen, attacks even the extremely aged. 24. But the important fact to be learnt from this summary is, that, as a rule, the disease does not appear in any recognizable form until after children have been probably born to the person afflicted. If to the ages above 20 I had added the ages from 17 to 20, which are fairly numerous, and at which men and women are often fertile in this country, this fact would have appeared more marked. 25. In regard to the character of the complaint from which people of this country suffer, the histories mention three varieties: the tubercular, ansthetic, and the mixed tubercular and ansthetic. I give a typical case of each variety. The tubercular.-" Case of Dhuman, aged 55, formerly a weaver, now a beggar, examined on 31st May 1875. Both ears long and pendulous, face tuberculated, the skin of the body looks tender and shrivelled. No discolouration or ansthetic spots. All the toes ulcerated, the left little toe dropped off about four months ago : about a year ago had an attack of ulceration of the internal membrane of the nose, wherein maggots generated, and now there is a large hole over the left side of the nose. Has suffered for 10 years." The ansthetic.-" Case of Dhalip, aged 50, employed as a cultivator. Itching sensation all over the body at times, pains in all large joints, sensation of heat at the soles of the feet and palms of the hands and chest. Has profuse perspirations of a greasy nature. The right hip and dorsum of the right hand quite benumbed. Both feet swollen. Has suffered for two years." The case of Kesri given in a previous paragraph illustrates the appearances which may be expected after lengthened suffering from this form of the disease. Kesri had suffered for 20 years. The mixed.-"Case of Nathwa, aged 30, employed as a sweeper, examined on 10th June 1875. The disease commenced five years ago by the appearance of small red patches over the left scapula, insensible to the touch, and free from itching. Now the face is lobulated there are large pinkish elevated ansthetic blotches over the chest, the lobes of the ears are lobular, the skin of the extremities is corrugated and shining, and of a dark pink hue. Both nipples are hypertrophied. Has an ulcer, covered with a hard crust, on the right great toe, caused by the rubbing of a new shoe." 26. In the 1,531 history cases these varieties number as follows : tubercular 791, ansthetic 640, mixed 64, character not stated 36. But I have reason to think the varieties are not correctly stated in the Mainpuri Police return, and, excluding the 472 cases reported from that district, the remaining 1,059 cases are distributable as follows : ansthetic 516, tubercular 443, mixed 64, character not stated 36. Altogether, I think, it may be concluded the ansthetic is the most common form of the complaint, the tubercular less common, the mixed form comparatively rare. 27. Of the 1,531 persons included in the history statements, 278 had never been married, and were consequently childless: by far the greatest number of these unmarried lepers being, indeed, children and persons of less than 20 years of age. To the remaining 1,253 persons, as many as 3,535 children had been born, of whom 1,951 were living at the time of examination. The resulting average is 2.8 children born to each leper, and 1.5 living.
(9) In respect to this point, the information received from Mainpuri is imperfect, if not very incorrect. Eliminating the figures referring to that district, the account stands for the remaining districts-3.5 children born to each leper, and 1.7 living. That is the average for each leper, male and female, of the list. A very con- siderable number of the married lepers were childless, but by far the greater majority had been parents to fairly large families, and as many as 282 of the persons examined had had families ranging in number from 5 to 18 children. I think the evidence is conclusive that lepers are as prolific as mankind in general. 28. The periods of cohabitation, after the disease appeared, between man and wife in the case of the 1,253 married lepers, or lepers who had been married, are divisible as follows:  1 2 3 4 5 6  Period not  stated. Less than  6 months. From 6 months to 5 years. For more than 5 years. Separated at time of at- tack or hus- band or wife dead previ- ous to attack. Total. Number of presons ... 63 30 308 517 335 1,253 The table provides, in columns 2, 3, and 4, a total of 855 cases in which cohabita- tion continued after the disease appeared in either husband or wife. Of these 855 cases the histories expressly state that in 831 the disease was not communicated to the healthy husband or wife, and that in 24 cases both husband and wife were lepers, or became lepers. 29. As this favours in some measure an opinion of the contagious nature of the disease, it is necessary to record the exact circumstances in regard to these 24 cases. In thirteen of them I find that both husband and wife were acknowledged lepers at the time of marriage, twelve of these cases of leper marriages having occurred in the Almora Leper Asylum as part, apparently, of the system in force there. Of the remaining eleven cases the following is a detailed account, so far as it can be rendered from the records provided: No. 1.-The case of Nachal, 40 years of age, a sweeper, who married a woman who had leprosy, and at the age of 24 became himself a leper. No one of his own family had suffered from leprosy. No. 2.-The case of Mirwar, aged 45,.a Muhammadan weaver. His father and elder sister were lepers, and he himself became a leper at 30 years of age. His wife continued to live with him, and eventually suffered from leprosy. No. 3-The case of Dhuman, aged 55, a Hindu weaver. Has no recollec- tion as to the previous occurrence of leprosy in his own family. Became a leper at 45. His wife continued to live with him, and suffered from leprosy. No. 4.-The case of Dhalip, aged 50, a cultivator. No one of his own family had been a leper. Became a leper at. 48, and his wife was affected with the same complaint one year afterwards. No. 5.-The case of Gauri Shankar, aged 36, Rajput. His elder brother was a leper, and he himself became a leper at 32. His wife lived with him for two years afterwards, and was affected with leprosy. No. 6.-The case of Sitabu, aged 40, a Muhammadan woman. Her grand- father and father were lepers, and she became a leper at 28. Her husband lived with her for one year after she was affected, and he suffered from leprosy. No. 7.-The case of Bishn, aged 45, cultivator. His grandfather was a leper. His wife became a leper and died. Afterwards, at the age of 43, he him- self was attacked with leprosy. No. 8.-The case of Mani, aged 28, a sweeper. No blood relation affected. Became a leper at 18, and afterwards his wife was affected with leprosy. No. 9.-The case of Mli, aged 60, a cultivator. No member of his family previously affected. Became a leper at 40. His wife continued to live with him and was affected, but whether before or after the husband is not stated. No. 10.-The case of Sobah, aged 50, a cultivator. No blood relation had been a leper. His wife's father died of leprosy. His wife was attacked with leprosy in 1870 and he became a leper in 1871, at the age of 46. No. 11.-The case of Ramphal. aged 60, a Brahman landlord. His uncle was a leper. His wife became a leper when he was 38 years old; they continued to live together, and he himself became a leper at 50.
?( 10 ) 30. It may be seen that in cases Nos. 7 and 11 there is evidence of hereditary taint sufficient to account for the appearance of the disease, although the wife had not been affected. In No. 1 a young man deliberately married a leper woman, and became himself a leper at the early age of 24. It seems at least likely that the man had reason to think he himself was not free from hereditary taint, although he states to the contrary. In No. 6 a man marries a woman whose grandfather and father had been lepers. In No. 10 a man marries a woman whose father had died of leprosy. I think the same remark applies to these cases. In No. 2 a woman marries a man whose father and elder sister had been lepers. The same remark is applicable, although, perhaps, less forcibly than in the case of a man who marries a woman of notoriously leper family. In No. 5 a woman marries a man whose elder brother was a leper. Of the four remaining cases, Nos. 3, 4, 8, and 9. In No. 8 the early age at which the man was affected, at 18, points forcibly to hereditary taint. Altogether I think the conclusion probably well founded, that at least the majority of these cases in which both husband and wife suffered were cases of intermarriages between members of leprous families, the hereditary taint existing both in husband and wife. 31. But, granting that this conclusion may not be warrantable, still the fact remains that of 855 cases of cohabitation, than which no closer form of human intercourse can be imagined, only 11, or 1.3 per cent., are discoverable in which suspicion of the communication of the disease from the husband to the wife, or from the wife to the husband, arises. Guaged by this test, the probability of any contagious origin of leprosy arising out of the ordinary intercourse of lepers with the general public becomes infinite- simal. A view, further strengthened by the fact, that in some cases of the 855 above-mentioned, it is recorded that a leprous husband had married two or three wives, who cohabited with him without in any such instance any wife being affected with leprosy. 32. Yet, although infinitesimal, it cannot be declared non-existent, as viewed by the light thrown on this point in the histories under consideration. For, in addition to the perhaps doubtful cases recorded above, one leper at Cawnpore attri- buted the disease to contagion, in that he had lived next door to a shopkeeper who was a leper. And, most important of all, Dr. Fitzgerald records the case of a Colonel in the Indian Service who some years ago became a leper, and could account for his misfortune only by the fact that he had continued to cohabit with a Native woman after she had been attacked with leprosy. 33. In regard to hereditary taint as a cause of the disease, the histories contain valuable evidence which may be classified as follows :  RELATIONSHIPS.   Grandfather or grandm-other. Father or mo-ther. Uncle or aunt. Brother or sister. Cousin. Father-in-law or mother-in-law. Not stated. No relation af-fected, or does not know. Total. Number of lepers who acknowledged that such of their relations suffered from leprosy. 19 173 46 61 5 7 26 1,194 1,531 Deducting the seven persons who stated that their wife's father or mother only had suffered from leprosy, the first five columns of the account provide a total of 304 persons who stated that their blood relations had suffered from the disease within their knowledge, or nearly one in five (19.8 per cent.) of the lepers examined. Several of these 304 persons acknowledged that their blood relations for two or three generations back had suffered, and in such cases, only the fact as regards the near- est blood relation of those affected was entered in the statement. It will be noticed how large a proportion of those who acknowledged to heredi- tary taint stated that either father or mother had been affected. This was to be ex- pected of persons of limited or blunted intellect, such as the majority of lepers are, for they would be likely to know or remember little of any relation far removed or not living within their own sphere of observation. Nineteen persons stated that only their grand-parents had suffered, which points to the fact that leprosy may descend to the grand-children without visibly
( 11 ) affecting the intermediate generation. If this is so, it may not be unlikely that many of the 1,194 persons who stated their want of knowledge in regard to heredi- tary taint, or absolutely denied its existence as part of the history of their own cases, may have had leprous grandfathers or other relations of previous generations of whom they knew nothing. Some I think were likely to deny the fact of such taint, if they knew of it, from shame or disinclination to record any words of me- mory disrespectful to their departed forefathers. 34. This idea of, in reality, a larger average of cases of hereditary taint than the histories disclose, is upheld by the statements of some of the Civil Surgeons who recorded the facts on which this investigation rests. The Civil Assistant Surgeon of Tari District states, with regard to nineteen cases in which lepers examined there answered "No" to the question of hereditary taint, that he should be inclined to put down "unknown" as more nearly expressing their meaning. Dr. Wood, Civil Surgeon of Bijnor, is of opinion that many of the lepers examined by him, who denied any hereditary taint, were none the less subject to it. Dr. Jones, of Sahranpur, is of opinion that leprosy is as much hereditary as tuberculosis, and he has no doubt that the families of a much larger number of lepers than those who acknowledged it in his histories (18 out of 60) have been afflicted with leprosy, for there exists a great unwillingness on the part of lepers to confess that their families have been affected. Dr. Fitzgerald, of Shhjahnpur, is of opinion that leper parents will almost always beget leper children. Dr. Thomas, of Bnda, records the opinion of the Tahsildar of Sehond, to the effect that leprosy is invariably hereditary (confined to certain families) in that pergunnah. Dr. Hatchell, of Jaunpur, where of 30 lepers, 28 denied all knowledge of hereditary taint, is of opinion that no reliance can be placed on the information given under the head "family history". 35. In further proof of the probability that in these 1,531 histories the num- ber of cases connected with hereditary taint is under-stated, I should mention that of 60 cases reported by Dr. Hooper, from the Benares Leper Asylum, 33 of the persons examined acknowledged hereditary taint in the following relationships : 6, the grandfather or grandmother ; 9, the father or mother ; 11, the uncle or aunt ; 4, the brother or sister ; 3, the cousin. I think it probable that lepers living in an asylum, and, from experience, less likely to fear or suspect the object of examination, would be inclined to tell all they know. The result here gives rather more than 50 per cent. of the whole as cases connected with hereditary taint, and perhaps that may be accepted as near the truth in regard to this matter, so far as it can be determined by the testimony of living lepers. 36. But, viewed in any form, the testimony as disclosed in these histories is sufficient to prove that hereditary taint, unlike contagion, must be a potent cause of the continuation or prevalence of leprosy amongst the people of this country, perhaps the most potent of any cause in existence. 37. That there may be another cause, or other causes, cannot, however, be de- nied. The testimony in this direction is plain, and often repeated in the histories and the papers which accompanied them. And it seems certain that the cause or causes which first originated this form of disease are still in existence, and may originate the complaint in a man to whose history no suspicion of hereditary taint attaches. It cannot, I think, be possible that all the 1,194 persons, who denied hereditary influence, could have been mistaken : indeed, a few of them were very explicit in denying the existence of any such influence, sometimes to their knowledge for three generations back. 38. What these originating causes may be cannot, in the present state of our knowledge, be more than guessed at. They appear to be first and principally such climatic conditions, habits, or mode of life as conduce to the formation of constitu- tions in middle life prone to low forms of disease. In a person thus predisposed it seems probable that a previous attack of syphi- litic disease may result in the establishment of a condition of leprosy. Thus of 63 lepers examined at Sahranpur, 18, who denied hereditary taint, attributed their leprous condition to syphilis. And Dr. Jones records the opinion that syphilis is an important initiating cause in the comparatively few cases of leprosy generated anew. At Muzaffarnagar four persons of those examined attributed their leprosy to the results of venereal disease.
?( 12 ) Dr. Fitzgerald, of Shhjahnpur, is of opinion that syphilis may have some connection with the occurrence of leprosy. Seven of the 30 persons examined there had had syphilis before the leprosy made its appearance, and two had suffered from gonorrha ; and from enquiries made by Dr. Fitzgerald of intelligent Natives, he found the belief prevailing amongst them, that leprosy is sometimes developed where syphilis has been injudiciously treated with mercury. 39. That leprosy may be developed "de novo in persons against whom no suspicion of hereditary taint rests, seems to be most satisfactorily proved by the his- tories of two cases recorded by Dr. Fitzgerald. The first, the case of an Euro- pean lad who had become a leper, although there was no trace or suspicion of taint on the father's or mother's side, direct or remote. The young man was first seen at Agra in 1865, and again seven years afterwards at Bombay, where he had gone to be treated by Dr. Bhau Dhajee, who had acquired a widespread reputation for the cure of leprosy. But in this case the treatment pursued had not been attended with benefit or promise of improvement. The second, the case of an European lady, who left India in 1875 and suffered with symptoms of leprosy after her arrival in England. No suspicion of hereditary taint existed. 40. But the further consideration of this important point must be postponed until, as mentioned in paragraph 10, I have had opportunity for carefully recording the history and circumstances of all the lepers of a village in which the disease is unusually prevalent. And for this purpose I have it in mind to reside for some days, during the approaching cold season, in the immediate neighbourhood of certain centres of population thus notorious. The results of this local investigation will form the subject of a second com- munication to Government on this important matter. 41. The conclusions which may, I think, be fairly arrived at as the results of this present investigation, can be stated as follows : Leprosy in the North-Western Provinces is a disease so widely spread as to be known in all parts, but best known in Kumaun, Garhwl, Bnda, and probably Gorakhpur. Yet everywhere the places where first attacks occur are so scattered over the face of the country, as to almost preclude the idea that local conditions have any influence as a cause of the disease. This point, however, remains for further consi-deration. It is a disease specially of men as distinguished from women. A disease not peculiar to persons of any employment or religion, with the possible exception that persons of sedentary habits are prone to suffer. Leprosy affects in about equal proportions the well-to-do and the poor. It results, however, in reducing to beggary at least one-third of those attacked, though so long as labour is possible lepers are not debarred, by public opinion concerning them, from earning a lively- hood as before their attack. This reduction to beggary being much helped by the fact that the ansthetic variety, which leads most surely to mutilations of the hands and feet, is most prevalent. As a rule, leprosy assumes outward and hurtful appearance at the ages from 20 to 50 years, or after children have been born to those afflicted,-lepers, or those who are to suffer leprosy, being as prolific as mankind in general, and living as long. Its attack results so little from contagion, that only about 1 per cent. of 855 cases of cohabitation between a leprous husband and healthy wife, or leprous wife and healthy husband, resulted in showing leprosy of both husband and wife. This low average even being possibly reducible upon the well-founded supposition that the cases of leprosy of both husband and wife may in some instances have arisen from intermarriage of a man and woman in both of whom leprosy was hereditary. Leprosy is essentially a hereditary disease, as shown by the testimony of about 20 per cent. of persons examined, and probably in far greater proportion of all those afflicted in the Province, if the truth could be arrived at. But in addition to the few cases which may result from contagion, and the many which result from hereditary influence, there seem undoubtedly to be cases which arise in persons remote from contagion and of healthy families, the cir- cumstances of these "de novo" cases requiring further study and consideration. 41. I think the practical value of this investigation may be summed up in the statements-1st, that lepers of all suffering mankind are most worthy of compass- sionate consideration, at least such of them as, by mutilation, are reduced to beggary. For it is certain that a large proportion of these suffering men (and men have less expectation of help from relations than women) have fallen into misery and poverty without shadow of self-fault or misbehaviour. The evil was born with them, therefore they suffer, yet linger in life. For this reason they are worthy objects of charity, and are properly cared for in good
(13) numbers in the leper asylums which exist in several places in the Province. Yet, from the number of helpless lepers who may be found begging in public throughout the Province, it seems probable that the asylum accomodation is insufficient, or the asylum management disagreeable. And, 2nd, that any measure of sequestration of lepers, with a view to the eradication of the disease, such as I understand is in force in Norway, is not likely to attain its objects here, seeing that in the great majority of cases the disease has been transmitted to the coming generation before any accurate knowledge of its existence in men now living can be attained to. For I do not suppose it possible to sequestrate an apparently heathly man because his grandfather or father had been lepers. SANITARY COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE, N. W. P.: C.

IN continuation of letter No. 3187 of the 26th September last, I am desired to forward, for the information of the Government of India, copy of a letter from the Officiating Sanitary Commissioner, No. 1853 of the 12th June, communicating a few remarks on the causation and distribution of leprosy.

WITH reference to the correspondence noted in the margin regarding the causation and distribution of leprosy, I have the honour to state that I am unable to give, from my own personal knowledge, any further information on the subject than that already furnished. by my pre- decessor, Dr. DeRenzy, in his letter No. 1065, dated 6th December 1874. 2. As far as I can learn from the remarks made by the several Civil Surgeons of the Province in their sanitary reports for the past year, it appears that the disease does not exist to any great extent in the Punjab, nor is it anywhere local- ized. The extent to which it prevails in municipal towns will be seen on a reference to the late census statements published in the Supplementary Gazette of the Punjab Government of the 1st February 1877. The total number of lepers entered in them was 346. 3. Herewith are subjoined the remarks of those Civil Surgeons who have dwelt upon this subject in their reports. Mr. Fox, in civil medical charge of the Hoshiarpur District, states-" Leprosy in the Hoshiarpur District is not localized but diffused. A leper village exists, about two miles from Hoshiarpur, which contains about fifteen or twenty souls, and they are from different villages in the district: besides a few are to be seen along the road to Dusuha and Garshankar. There is no peculiarity connected with the place where the village is situated. The village is in a cluster of trees, and to the North-east flows a 'choi'. The water for drinking purposes, &c., is procured from a well in the vicinity; they live chiefly on charity; their food is very scanty- consisting of dal and cakes; they are very filthy in their habits, and have scarcely any covering. Thirteen cases of leprosy treated in hospital. The disease ap- peared in three after a severe attack of gonorrha; in two after primary syphilis; two after exposure to wet and cold; three attribute the disease to itch, and three from causes unknown, though all declare that none of their relatives ever suffer- ed from the disease. From the statement of these cases none appear to have been caused from 'hereditary taint' or contagion. In the venereal cases the disease appeared two years after the attack, and in all cases the prevailing symptoms were ansthesia, with roughness and thickening of the cutis." Dr. H. Whitwell, Civil Surgeon, Amritsar District, states-" Nothing that I have noticed since my stay here has led me to believe in the existence of localized leprosy in the district. There is a leper asylum at Tarn Taran, but this is more a provincial establishment, and in the majority of instances the cases seeking admission are in an advanced stage of the disease, and no reliable information is to be obtained regarding the history. On only one point is there any reliability to be placed, that is on the hereditary tendency of the disease." Dr. R. G. Quinell, Civil Surgeon, Gujranwala, states-"Leprosy is not very prevalent in this district, and few cases present themselves for treatment. At the village of Dhaukal, near Wazirabad, where a fair, the largest in this district, is held every year in June. A large number of lepers from all parts of the Province,
?(2) with other mendicants, collect there for the sake of alms, which are largely dis- tributed, but their stay is too short to allow of any particulars regarding their condition or history being satisfactorily ascertained." The Civil Surgeon of Muzaffargarh, Mr. J. Connor, states-" Leprosy is a very uncommon disease here, but many people having the disease come from other parts of the Punjab on a pilgrimage to the shrine of a Muhammadan saint called Pir Jehawah-this proceeding being considered by the Natives an infallible remedy for the disease. Nevertheless I have had some cases appealed from the saint to me, as he did not seem to favour them. All the cases I have seen have come from other parts of the Punjab: they have been of the tubercular variety." Dr. E. McKellar, Civil Surgeon, Sialkot, remarks-" There is a leper asylum here, about ten miles from Sialkot, which has been for seven years under the medical charge of Assistant Surgeon Fatteh Singh, who has furnished me with the following information: " At present there are about sixty lepers in the asylum, only two-thirds of whom, however, have been received from this district. They are of all castes, Hindus, Muhammadans, and sweepers, &c., &c. About a fourth of those now under treat- ment are females. The patients are very liberally dieted, receiving one seer ' atta' daily, meat twice a week, also curd, dl and green vegetables, and they get also a summer and winter set of clothing during the year. There appears to be no particular locality in the district more affected by leprosy than others. As regards individual cases, Babu Fatteh Singh makes the following remarks: "In examining the medical history of these cases, no connection can pos- sibly be traced between fish-eating, dl-eating, or in the eating of any other de- scription of grain, and the production of leprosy. Poor living, hereditary syphilis, scrofula and malarious poisoning seem to be at the bottom of many cases. Out of eighteen cases minutely analysed, in only six of them did the disease appear to be hereditary. Of these six, in two the father only was affected; in one the mother only. In three, either the father or mother, brother or sister was diseased, and not the parents. Of the eighteen male cases, two married leprous females and each begot a male child. In one case, the child is now five years' old, and in the other, two years old, and both are sound and healthy children. No facts are known that favour the idea that leprosy is contagious. The disease in the asylum presents all forms-tubercular, ansthetic and mixed. Plenty of good exercise in the open air, cleanliness, and carbolic acid applications, externally, to the sores, constitute the best mode of treatment known at present. The gurjun oil treatment, although carried out for more than six months to the minutest details of Dr. McDougal's method, and under direct supervision, has utterly failed at this asylum, and is pronounced worse than useless by all the patients submitted to it." Dr. Calthrop, Civil Surgeon, Kangra District, states-" Leprosy does not prevail extensively in any portion of the Kangra District, the cases which are seen being met with here and there in all tahsils. There is a small leper asylum, situated a few miles beyond the jail, in which twenty-two inmates, who choose to come of their own accord, are fed and provided for. This institution is under the charge of the Nazir of the Sadr Kutcheri, and, until my taking medical charge of the district, was only visited rarely by the Jail Native Doctor, to whom an allowance of Rs. 5 per month was made. On reporting the unsatisfactory nature of this arrangement to the Deputy Commissioner, I got a compounder permanently appointed to the asylum on a salary of Rs. 10, whose business it is to treat casual ailments. A large sum of money has been set aside for the pur- chase of gurjun oil, but I regret to say I have not been able to give this plan of treatment a fair trial, owing to none being procurable from the Medical Store Department. I am hoping, however, to get some this spring, and, if so, shall further enlarge on this topic in my next year's report." Dr. Henderson, Civil Surgeon, Rawal Pindi District, states-" Leprosy does not appear to be very common in the district, for most of the lepers in the Pindi Leper Asylum come from other districts or from Kashmir. A separate report will be sent in regarding the leper asylum and the effect of the treatment of gurjun  oil."  Dr. Dale, Civil Surgeon, Jhelum District, states-" Leprosy is uncommon, only three cases came under my observation during the year-two in the jail and one at the dispensary-the former (jail cases) were hereditary, the dispensary case was a mild one and appeared late in life; the subject, a khidmatgar. He was much benefitted-he himself declared cured -by the gurjun oil treatment. Of the jail cases, one died from another disease, a very bad case in an advanced ulcerated stage. The other was lost sight of on release. Neither were benefitted by the treatment (gurjun oil.)"
(3) The Civil Surgeon of the Gujrat District, Dr. Ferguson, remarks-"Leprosy occurs in considerable amount in the Northern part of the district, under the low range of the hills. I am not aware of any reason for its being more abundant there than elsewhere, beyond the fact that lepers are not kept apart from the rest of the villagers, and in most cases even live in the same house as their relatives. I have met with several instances where more than one member of the same family was affected. N. C. D.-Home, Rev. & Agri. Dept. Press-No. 460-22-8-79-100.
No. 215 S, dated Simla, the 14th July 1877. From-LEPEL GRIFFIN, Esq., Offg. Secretary to the Govt. of the Punjab. To-The Offg. Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department. IN continuation of my letter No 141 S, dated 3rd instant, I am desired to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a report on the subject of leprosy received from the Civil Surgeon of Rawal Pindi. No. 131, dated the 15th June 1877. From-Surgeon Major G. HENDERSON, Civil Surgeon, Rawal Pindi. To-The Offg. Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab. I HAVE the honour to forward the information called for by you regarding the leper asylum here. There are at present 90 persons in the asylum, three of these are children as yet unaffected; only 28 of these are inhabitants of this district, 54 are from Kashmir, three from Hazara, one from Peshawar, three from Guzerat, and one from Allahabad. They are accommodated in fourteen houses, each containing four rooms; but it is very desirable that more houses should be built, as it is now necessary to refuse admission to many who present themselves. One of the fourteen houses is occupied by the establishment, which numbers nine individuals. The institution is not under my charge, though I take a great interest in it, and should like to see it taken in hand by Government, instead of being left to be provided for by municipal funds. If the lepers were treated with a little more liberality, I feel certain that all the lepers in the surrounding country would come to the institution, and probably the disease would be stamped out in one or two generations. The cost of establishment is about Rs. 50 per mensem, and the 87 lepers, at Rs. 2-8 each per mensem, cost about Rs. 217 per mensem; the children, are allowed from Rs. 2 to Rs. 1-4 per mensem. Since I have had civil medical charge here I have endeavoured to relieve the monotony of the lives of these wretched people by getting them to take to garden- ing, and I have made presents to them of pigeons and rabbits. I have also had a number of them taught to read. I enclose a list of lepers treated by gurjun oil and carbolic acid, with the result. The effect of these remedies is not very marked until quite recently, but in almost all the cases some slight improvement has resulted, and the lepers themselves now are most anxious to persevere with it, as it usually heals their sores and causes the disappearance of the tubercles in the tuber- cular form of the disease. The treatment has been persevered with for two years. During the first year little good was effected, and the lepers had no faith in it. It is only of late that they have begun to notice any marked effects. I have said that I believe the disease could be stamped out in one or two generations if all lepers were encouraged by liberal treatments to come and live in the asylum. My reasons for making this statement are- (I.) that after the disease becomes fully developed the subjects of it are usually barren; and (II.) that one case in the asylum tends to confirm the belief that the disease is contagious. This case is as follows : The cook at the asylum, whose father is a chaprasi at the tahsil at Rawal Pindi, and in whose family there is no history of leprosy, fell in love with one of the leper women and kept company with her for some time. Before many months he shewed signs of leprosy and asked to be admitted as a leper; he is now married to the woman, and they both live in the asylum. (III.) It will be seen from the list of cases treated by gurjun oil, which were taken at random, that in ten out of twelve of the cases the disease seems to have been either hereditary or transmitted by contagion from relatives.

Chumparun. Manbhum. Mozufferpur. Hazaribagh. Purneah. Sonthal Pergunnahs. Jalpaiguri. Bhagalpur. Gya. Sarun. Buxar (Sub-Division).  I AM directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 598, dated the 27th July last, submitting with your remarks reports from the Civil Surgeons of the districts noted on the margin on the distri- bution and causation of leprosy and the prevalence of that disease in those districts, together with an abstract of these reports prepared by the Deputy Surgeon General, Dinapore Circle. The papers will be forwarded for the information of the Government of India in the Home Department. 2. Referring to paragraph 8 of your letter, I am to request that you will be so good as to convey to Drs. Wilson and Macleod the thanks of this Government for the attention which they have given to the subject and the care with which their reports have been prepared. At the same time I am to add that the Lieutenant-Governor cannot but regret the apparent indifference which has been shewn by many medical officers to the call which was made upon them for reports regarding leprosy. The census returns of 1872 indicate that the disease is lamentably prevalent in the districts of Burdwan, Bancoo- rah, Beerbhum, Sonthal Pergunnahs, Moorshedabad, Rungpur and Darjeeling, and it especially behoved the medical officers, to whom the charge of these districts have been committed, to give their atten- tion to the matter. Of all these officers Dr. Z. U. Ahmed is the only one who has submitted a report at all, and even this report is practi- cally of no value. 3. I am now to request that you will be so good as to issue renewed instructions to all officers who have failed to submit the reports required, shewing in detail what is expected of them, and that you will also intimate to them that the Lieutenant-Governor expects to receive from them well considered and careful reports by the end of April next.

COPY of the above letter, and of that to which it is a reply, with its enclosures in original, submitted to the Secretary to the Govern- ment of India in the Home Department for information with refer- ence to Home Department Resolution No. 1-136, dated the 5th March 1875.

?(2) From the Civil Surgeons  With memorandum of Chyebassa, Purulia,  No. 1475 of the Hazaribagh, Sonthal  20th May 1876, Pergunnahs, Bhagal-  from the De- pur, Chuprah, Chum-  puty Surgeon parun, Mozufferpur,  General, Dina- Purneah, Buxar, Jalpai-  pore. guri and Gya.  The accompanying reports* are all I have been able to collect, and they are now submitted for the information of His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor. They show that the disease is not widely diffused among the people of Bengal, that there is no especial proneness to it in any one locality, that it is pretty equally divided between Muhammadans and Hindus, and that probably special conditions of life develop the disease largely among both classes. 3. Thus among Muhammadans, Julahas, whose occupation is weaving, whose habits are filthy, and whose manners are dissolute, and who, moreover, live exclu- sively upon an animal diet, whose quality is a matter of sublime indifference, leprosy is found to prevail most widely, 368.05 per mille; while among Badiahs, Hindus, and who live on snakes, mice, frogs, are inattentive to clothing, and thus exposed to all vicissitudes of weather, the percentage reaches 241 per mille. 4. It would almost follow from this that their conditions of life stood in the relation of cause and effect to leprosy, yet no such deduction may be drawn when it is further found that among Rojwars and Telis the proportion respectively is 1.64 and 1.16, though notoriously the former live in much the same manner as the Badiahs, while the latter are supremely filthy, rarely, if ever, going outside of their premises. 5. Confining the enquiry for a moment to Hindus, no caste appears to be specially liable to the disease, since among eight lepers found in the village of Kadergunge, in the Gya District; the cases were seen in the Kahar, Gowala, Teli, Bamwar, Hajjam, Fakir, and Passee. 6. The largest number suffer from the disease between the ages of 40 and 50, while among 1,382 lepers only two had been the subjects of it under ten, and no more than 36 under 20 years of age-a circumstance by no means calculated to strengthen the view of leprosy being primarily and chiefly hereditary. Throughout these reports there is but one instance of a child being born with decided signs of the disease. 7. As foul feeding and filthy habits seem to have unquestionable influence in developing the disease, it is a fair deduction to draw that the reverse conditions imposed upon those undergoing treatment by gurjun oil have material power in aiding the action of that remedy, and personally I shall not be much surprised if hereafter 50 per cent. of the benefit may not be assigned to them by the majority of professional observers. 8. Dr. Roderick Macleod, of Gya, and Honorary Surgeon William Wilson, of Manbhum, have, I think, merited commendation for the carefulness with which they have written their reports. Office Memorandum No. 1475, dated Dinapore, the 20th May 1876. IN reply to circular from the Surgeon General's Office No. 26 of the 18th instant, the undersigned very much regrets that he had quite overlooked the fact that the reports on leprosy called for in circular No. 12 of 17th April 1875 had not been submitted. They have been lying in this Office for months past, and are now forwarded. The undersigned appends hereto a prcis of the information con- tained in each report, and from this it will appear that they do not give much information regarding the disease, although some of the facts stated (if they are facts) are interesting.

?(4) No. 133, dated Chyebassa, the 20th November 1875. From-The Civil Surgeon, Chyebassa. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Dinapore Circle. WITH reference to circular memorandum No. 12, dated the 17th April 1875, of the Surgeon General, and enclosure, forwarded with your circular memorandum No. 11, dated the 21st April 1875, calling for a report on the existence, &c., of leprosy, I have the honour to submit the following report after a personal enquiry in some parts of this district. Leprosy exists all over the district, but to a much greater extent in.the West and South-West of it. A personal visit to Suranda and its neighbourhood has shewn that there was not a village visited that had not its leper; in some there were more than one, and, if the sparse and scanty popula- tion of the place be considered, the percentage of lepers to population must be very high, but there exist no data or statistics to shew what this percentage may be. The special peculiarities of this part of the district are the denseness of the jungles and the dampness of the soil. The level of this part of the country is high; it is much more elevated than many other parts of the district; in short, it consists mainly of hills and valleys; but the large number of streams and rivulets, the heavy fall of dew at night, resembling drizzling rain, and the denseness of the jungles preventing evaporation, keeps the soil in a perpetual state of saturation all the year round. The inhabitants of this part of the district are very poor; their chief diet is of a vegetable nature, mostly consisting of the produce of the jungles. They taste animal diet at rare intervals; and as to fish, with the exception of one or two months in the year, and even then it is very scarce, it is not procurable for their indulgence either fresh or putrid. In the majority of the lepers seen by me hereditary taint could be traced to either one or both parents or grandparents. In a few no cause could be assigned, and although the people have a fixed notion of its being highly contagious, I have found no case to which this cause could be traced. The form of leprosy in the greatest number was of the ansthetic variety; a few were of the mixed kind. I saw only one that was of the purely tubercular. No. 403, dated Purulia, the 28th July 1875. From-W. WILSON, Esq., M. D., Civil Surgeon, Manbhum. To-The Deputy Surgeon General of the Dinapore Circle. IN compliance with your circular memorandum No. 11, dated 21st April last, and the correspondence therewith forwarded, and in special reference to the conclud- ing portion of paragraph 8 of the Resolution of the Home Department, No. 136 (Medical), dated 5th March last, I beg to submit the following information on the questions therein mooted relative to the prevalency of leprosy in Manbhum: Question I.-" The extent to which leprosy exists among the people in each district ?" Answer 1. (A).-The census of 1872 shewed a population of 995,570 persons with 543 lepers, or one leper in 1,833, being equal to 54 per 1,000. (B).-In a male population of 500,936 there were 429 lepers, or one in 1,167, being equal to 85 per 1,000. (C).-In a female population of 494,634 there were 114 lepers, or one in 4,338, being equal to 23 per 1,000 only. (D).-It will thus be seen that leprosy exists to a far greater extent among men and boys than it does among women and girls; the proportion of the male to the female population is 1.01, whilst that between male and female lepers is 371. (E).-This district is divided into nineteen police or registering stations, which vary immensely in area and population, and the number of lepers in each of which varies from 137 to one. For example, Rughonathpur Police Thannah, consisting of 394 villages and containing 87,561 souls, has 137 lepers, or one in 639, being equal to 15 per 1,000; whilst in the Purulia Thannah, which consists of 633 villages, and which contains 150,668 persons, there were only 83 lepers, being one in 1,815, being equal to 55 per 1,000; but in the least leprous registering station-that of Neenha, which consists of 100 villages, and which has a population of 7,612-there is but a solitary leper, giving 13 per 1,000 only.
(5) The remaining 322 lepers are distributed over the other sixteen registering stations, consisting of 5,241 villages, and containing 749,729 souls, so that it will be seen that every eleven villages contain a leper, and that every 1,833 persons have a leper in their midst, being equal to 54 per 1,000 of the whole population of the district. The disproportions of lepers is so marked in the three registering stations of Rughonathpur, Purulia and Neenha-especially in the first and last, being large and small respectively-that I was induced to apply to the Deputy Commissioner for the names of villages containing an unusual number of lepers, and their numbers in each village; but that officer now informs me that such information cannot be furnished under another month. Rather than keep back this report any longer, I prefer submitting it at the present time. I thought that the vernacular examina- tion papers used for compiling the census of 1872 might have been available at once, but it seems otherwise. Question II.-" If localized, the locality in which it is chiefly found ?" Answer II. (A)-As I have nearly completed my ninth year of service in Manbhum, and as I travel over a great part of it every winter verifying the vaccine operations of ex-inoculators, I can confidently affirm that there is no such place as a leper village anywhere. The lepers are scattered in twos and threes in different villages, though I think larger numbers are to be found in or near good-sized villages, because the chances of obtaining alms are better, just as we have eight or nine resident lepers in our house of refuge at the sadr station. These people enjoy the benefit of medical treatment, obtain a greater share of public charity, and are sheltered-three great advantages it must be confessed. (B.)-The localization of leprosy is unknown for reasons stated above. Question III.-"The special peculiarities of this locality, if there are any, and the special conditions in other respects under which the people live in this locality ?" Answer III.-The foregoing question is answered by a statement of the fact that the disease is not confined to any particular class or place in Manbhum. Question IV.-In regard to individual cases and the "circumstances under which they seem to have arisen, whether by contagion or hereditary taint, or any other cause ?" Answer IV.-From enquiries made of some well-informed people and of lepers, I have ascertained that though there is a very general impression as regards the contagiousness of leprosy, nobody can give me any positive assurance of his having taken the disease by personal contact with a leper. The latter is avoided here, as elsewhere, on account of his repulsiveness and the dread of being touched by him or receiving anything from his hands. That leprosy is transmitted from parent to child is unquestionable; and I am assured by a leper, who served many years in a leprous family, that the grandfather, son and grandson were all more or less afflicted with the disease. I am also assured by an intelligent man that he saw a child born with the characteristic marks of leprosy, and that death took place seven years afterwards. As "long reports are not required", and as "concise summaries will suffice", I have answered the four leading questions in the manner suggested, with a few additional particulars only. Dated Hazaribagh, the 10th July 1875. From-E. A. BIRCH, Esq., M. D., Civil Surgeon. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Dinapore Circle. IN compliance with your circular memorandum No. 11 of 21st April, I have the honour to submit the following report regarding leprosy: Leprosy is certainly a rare affection in this district; the census returns only shew eleven cases, and they are not localized in any particular part of the district. I daresay the census returns are in this particular under the mark; but speaking from general observation and enquiry, there is no doubt that Hazaribagh is comparatively free from the pest. So far as the district is concerned, I regret that I
?(6) cannot give any further information, but we have treated five cases with gurjun oil, and below I give the particulars: Case No. I.-Gureeb Doss, Hindu, male, was admitted on 15th July 1874 and discharged on the 17th June 1875, having thus been under treatment for a period of eleven months and two days. The patient was 25 years of age, a native of Lucknow, and a pilgrim from Juggurnath. He was brought by the police in a cart to the hospital, and was found to be in a most frightful state of emaciation and disease. He had, he stated, suffered from leprosy for about five years, but none of his relatives are lepers. When admitted, he was literally only bone and skin, and his body was covered with sores, more especially the soles of his feet and palms of his hands. He had lost several fingers and toes, and there was complete ansthesia of several parts of his body. In addition to the gurjun oil treatment he was liberally fed and stimulated. After a lapse of about two months all the sores had healed, and the man bore no resemblance to his former self, but this, of course, was in great part due to the feeding. When he was discharged from hospital, save the stumps of his fingers and toes, he bore no appearance of being a leper; even his voice had greatly improved and become somewhat smcoth; sensation was perfect all over body, and the patient started off stoutly to walk to Lucknow. Case No. II.-Ukul, a Mussalman, native of Hazaribagh, aged thirteen years, admitted 24th August 1874, discharged 17th June 1875. Period under treatment nine months and twent-three days. None of his relatives ever affected with leprosy. In various parts of the body there were slightly raised whitish patches which were quite ansthetic. His countenance and voice were very characteristic. After the lapse of three months sensation began to return, and when discharged sensation was everywhere perfect and coloration natural. This boy was a well-nourished lad, and never received in hospital any unusual diet. Case No. III.-Kally Dass, aged twenty, a native of Lucknow and a pilgrim, admitted 13th March, discharged on 18th May. Period in hospital two months and five days. Has been suffering for two years. No history of hereditary taint. There were ulcers on the soles of feet and palms of hands, loss of sensation in several localities, thickening of the skin of the fingers and other signs. He im- proved rapidly and was discharged cured. Case No. IV.-Thumiagu, a female, married, aged 30 years, a native of Gya, admitted as an out-patient on 7th April. Is still under treatment. She states she has been suffering for three years past; no hereditary history; is a case of well- marked tubercular leprosy. A very considerable improvement has taken place. Case No. V.-Ahmed Ali, aged 35 years, a native of Hazaribagh, admitted as an out-door patient on 31st May, and is still under treatment. Has been a leper for the last six years. His relatives, he states, are free from leprosy. A case of tubercular leprosy in a more advanced step than the last. Improvement is steadily going on much to the patient's satisfaction. No. 893, dated Doomka, the 24th July 1875. From-Surgeon Z. U. AHMED, M. D., Officiating Civil Surgeon, Sonthal Pergunnahs. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Dinapore Circle. WITH reference to your circular memorandum No. 11, dated the 21st April last, forwarding Surgeon General's circular memorandum No. 12 of 17th April, and Bengal Government letter No. 1272 of 30th March last, I have the honour to report for your information that leprosy is not a common disease of this district; but a good number of lepers may be seen at Deoghur Sub-Division of the district. There is nothing peculiar about the climate and sanitary condition of that sub- division; but it being one of the important places of Hindu worship, almost all the lepers are attracted to it from other districts, as they can easily get alms from the numerous jatrees to the Temple of Bydeanath; and some of the lepers come to the place on the faith that they may get rid of their horrible disease by pilgrim- age to the temple there I have not seen the Sonthals, the natives of this place, suffer much from the disease, and have not had any experience of its propagation from contagion. No. 443, dated Bhagalpur, the 13th July 1875. From-Surgeon Major N. B. BAILLIE, Civil Surgeon of Bhagalpur. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Dinapore Circle. WITH reference to your circular memorandum No. 11 of 21st April last, I have the honour to report as follows.
(  ? ) 2.    Leprosy occurs in all its forms-eruptive, ansthetic, tubercular and mixed- in this district.    Some years ago  a return  was made by the police in which it was stated that there were upwards of 800 lepers in this district,   but  I am inclined to think that this is below the actual number. 3.    The persons affected are almost always males  of adult age,  chiefly of the lower and  generally  of the very lowest classes of society.    Females, children and persons of the better class are rarely affected,  or  at  any  rate do   not often  come under observation. 4.    I have not met with any evidence shewing that the disease is either  here- ditary or contagious, nor am I aware that it is especially prevalent in any particular part of the district.    More cases are probably met with in the chief town, but  this is rather due to the fact that the worst cases, who live solely  by  begging,  congre- gate there in greater numbers. 5.    The general sanitary condition of the people of this district  is very imper- fect.    A large portion of the land is low-lying and subject  to  annual  floods  from the various rivers which flow through  it.    Damp  and malaria are,  therefore,   the normal condition during many months of the year.    The water they drink is usually of excessively hard quality, and often  contains  a  very  large  quantity  of organic matter.    The  diet  of the  poor classes is  excessively  monotonous.    Rice  is   the staple of course-often I have reason  to  believe-of   very  inferior  quality.    New grain of all sorts is also largely consumed, and is the cause of much sickness.    Fish is an article of diet that is also largely used by the lower classes ; and is perhaps the only form in which the greater part of them ever  taste   animal  food.    The supply of antiscorbutic vegetables and fruits is also very defective  during the greater part of the year to the great detriment of health.    Owing to their scanty  clothing,   the skin is constantly exposed to the air, added to which its habitually  dirty  state ren- ders it exceedingly liable to be affected by disease; their miserable huts without light or ventilation, and the air fouled by the fumes of wood or other fuel used for   cook- ing, must be a further cause of disease. 6.    Cases of leprosy do not come under observation  unless  sought  for.    As a rule they cannot be admitted into  general  dispensaries  for  treatment   as in-door patient, and their erratic habits  and the slow appearance of improvement  prevents them continuing for long their attendance as out-patient. Report by D. PICACHY, Civil Medical Officer, Purneah, dated the 29th July 1875, on leprosy, in accordance with circular memorandum No. 12, dated Fort William, the 17th April 1875. LEPROSY is not endemic, and does not exist among the people in this district to any great extent. The cases are scattered and not confined to any particular locality. The subjects are chiefly beggars, males and unmarried. A male leper is sometimes to be seen accompanied by a healthy looking woman, and by this means, although all hereditary tendency to the disease is denied, there is strong reason to believe that it is thus propagated. I have two lepers just now, brothers, and pri- soners in the jail, who declare that their parents are healthy subjects. There is no direct evidence of contagion among the lepers whose history has been questioned. No. 1491, dated Jalpaiguri, the 27th July 1875. From-E. BOVILL, Esq., Civil Surgeon of Jalpaiguri. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Dinapore Circle. WITH reference to your circular memorandum No. 40, dated Dinapore, 6th July 1875, I beg to inform you that I have not been able to collect any figures on the subject of prevalence of leprosy amongst the people of this district. It seems to be agreed that the disease is most prevalent amongst the Mechis, a tribe which inhabits the Terai and foot of the hills-a district almost necessarily fatal to other people except during the cold season. All the cases that have applied at the dis- pensary up to date have been Mechis. The prevalence of leprosy amongst these people is ascribed by the Bengalis to a habit they have of eating the ashes of plantains in place of salt, or to economise salt. I have not been long enough in the district to furnish any reliable information.
( 8 ) No. 898, dated Gya, the 3rd October 1875. From-R. MACLEOD, Esq., M. D., Civil Surgeon of Gya. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Dinapore Circle. WITH reference to your circular memorandum No. 11, dated the 11th April last, and enclosures, on the subject of leprosy as it exists in Bengal, I have the honour to submit the following remarks on the disease as it prevails in this district. 2. Through the assistance of the District Magistrate I obtained a return from the areas, urban and rural, selected for the registration of deaths. As the collecting agents were in some measure acquainted with this sort of enquiry, I thought more reliable returns would be obtained than if the scheme embraced the district generally. 3. The census return for 1872 gave the number of lepers among a population of 1,949,750 at 1,912, whereas the return under report puts the number among a population of 401,623 at 1,382. I have reason to believe that the latter statement is approximately correct. 4. Of this number 108 are unmarried, 1,110 are married to healthy persons who are alive, 159 were married to healthy persons who are now dead, while only three are married to lepers who are alive, and two were married to lepers who are dead. 5. One thousand two hundred and twenty-six are said not to have inherited the disease, 70 have relatives who are affected with leprosy, and 86 have had father or mother similarly affected. 6. The following statement shows the age and the duration of the disease of those affected : AGE. Under 10 years. 10 to 20 years. 20 to 30 years. 30 to 40 years. 40 to 50 years. 50 to 60 years.

( 9 )          7. Hindus and Muhammadans appear to be affected in an equal proportion. There is, however, one notable exception in the case of a class of Muhammadans (Jullahs) whose occupation is weaving, and who live in rather an indiscriminate manner; eat animal food without rejecting any portion of it, whether wholesome or otherwise, and who are filthy in their habits. Among them the ratio of those affected reaches the high figure of 368.05 per mille. Among Hindus, Bhuiyans, who live on snakes, mice and frogs, clothe badly, and are exposed to the vicissitudes of the weather, rank the highest,-the ratio in their case being 2.41 per mille. The ratio per mille among Rajwars, who live like Bhuiyans, and among Telis, whose occupation confines them much to their houses, is, respectively, 1.64 and 1.16. 8. As far as I have been able to discover, locality does not appear to influence the existence of the disease, which is spread pretty equally over the entire district irrespective of elevation and composition of soil or drainage. 9. In villages where several cases live it is the exception to find that more than two belong to the same caste; for instance, in the village of Jadirgunge, where eight cases have lived since their birth, the following castes are represented, viz., Kahar, Gowala, Teli, Barnwar Hajjams (2), Faqir and Passee. In the village Sauntar there are five cases, viz., a Gowala, Kahar, Kairi, Rajwar and Mushor. The same rule applies generally to the district. 10. I regret that I am unable to submit a fuller report on such an interesting subject; by doing so would involve my investigating particular cases in distant parts of the district, and such an enquiry a medical officer could not conduct without neglecting other duties, especially in the rainy season, when much time would be lost in travelling in a district like this where more villages are inaccessible except those in the immediate vicinity of the Patna Branch Road. No. 170, dated Motihari, the 11th May 1875. From-J. CULLEN, Esq., M. D., Civil Surgeon of Chumparun. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Dinapore Circle. YOUR circular memorandum No. 11, dated 21st April 1875, forwarding memorandum No. 12, with enclosure, from the Surgeon General. I beg to state that I have no report to offer on the subject of leprosy, as during the time I have been in medical charge of the district, now nearly five years, I have not had occasion to treat a single case of any form of the disease, nor can I state positively that I have in the same period seen an undoubted case of the disease. I would not be understood to imply that isolated cases cannot be found in the district; but, if so, they are sufficiently seen not to have excited remark even among the general population. No. 170, dated Chupra, the 10th July 1875. From-C. M. RUSSELL, Esq., M. D., Civil Surgeon of Sarun. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Dinapore Circle. WITH reference to the Surgeon General's Office circular memorandum No. 12 of 17th April last, forwarded under cover of your Office circular No. 11 of 21st idem, 1 have the honour to report as follows: 1. Leprosy is more common amongst males in this district than amongst females. I have not met with any case of leprosy in subjects under ten years of age, or infants. 2. The disease is not localized to any part of the district, but is somewhat more frequent in the Sub-Divisions of Sewan and Gopalgunge than it is in and about Chupra. As far as I know, there are no special conditions of locality to account for this selective tendency, nor any special conditions under which the people live in respect of diet, clothing, cleanliness, &c., to account for the same. 3. I am not aware that any particular articles of diet induces or predisposes to the disease, but it is generally believed that the excessive consumption of beef brings on the disease. This is probably a vulgar error, and arises from the fact that the poorer classes of Muhammadans, who are chiefly beef-eaters, because they cannot afford to purchase mutton or goat's flesh, are more subject to the disease than Hindus.
?(10) 4. There is no doubt that the disease is hereditary, but some of the children of lepers escape the disease entirely. 5. The disease is probably not contagious, except in the ulcerative form, and that solely and purely by inoculation. 6. Special conditions of locality, such as swamps, damp, cold and malarious influences generally, seem to predispose to attacks of the disease, as also do personal conditions of uncleanliness and intemperance. No. 492. dated Mozufferpur, the 30th June 1875. From-E, GAYER, Esq., Civil Surgeon of Mozufferpur. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Dinapore Circle. IN reply to your circular memorandum No. 11, dated Dinapore, the 21st April 1875, forwarding circular memorandum No. 12, dated Fort William, 17th April 1875, from the Surgeon General, Indian Medical Department, calling for an early report in a concise form on the extent to which leprosy exists among the people in this district, I have the honour to state that I have not made a special study of this disease which, as far as I am able to judge, is not very common in this district. I have had the dispensary records searched for the last eight years, and find that during this time 963 cases of leprosy have applied for relief at the Mozufferpur Charity Hospital. Very nearly the whole of this number have been out-patients, and the form of leprosy has not been entered in the books, so I am un- able to say which form of leprosy has predominated; but from the experience I have had I think the ansthetic and mixed forms are most seen, and the Assistant Sur- geon at the dispensary thinks so likewise. During the last eight years 85,473 patients of all kinds have been registered in the Charity Hospital books, so that, if the people afflicted with leprosy have applied in an equal ratio with those suffer- ing from other diseases, it would appear that it is not very common here. Never- theless, there are a good many cases to be seen in the villages and elsewhere, but I am not aware that leprosy is at all localized in this district, nor in any way peculiar; both the tubercular and ansthetic varieties are to be seen. No doubt the chief cause of the propagation of leprosy here, as elsewhere, is hereditary transmission. No. 37, dated Buxar, the 24th June 1875. From-H. HARVEY, Esq., F. R. C. S., Civil Surgeon of Buxar. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Dinapore Circle. I HAVE the honour, in reply to your circular No. 28 of 17th instant, to state that circular No. 81 of the Surgeon General, dated 31st of August 1874, is not in my possession, and I am therefore unable to submit the report asked for. This probably is not a matter of any importance as no cases of leprosy have entered this hospital, and the return would, therefore, be a blank. It does not seem to be a common disease in this district, but I have no doubt that, if a search be made for cases, a few could be collected. The income of the Buxar dispensary is so small, and the demands on the institution so great, that I am obliged to exercise much strictness in the kind of cases which I admit as in-patients, unless the patient consents to pay for his own dieting, which they not unfrequently do. We can only afford to have three or four patients dieted daily from the hospital funds, and if we admitted tedious cases of leprosy, the hospital would become simply a leprosy hospital. When an hospital has a superabundance of patients, it appears to me that the proper course is to select those cases for admission in which the greatest benefit can be done. Each in-patient costs in diet about Rs. 4 a month, and if we received official assistance to that extent per patient, we could easily accommo- date and observe two or three cases of leprosy. R.

JOUBERT, M. B., F. R. C. S., Offg. Civil Surgeon of Burdwan. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Presidency Circle. IN accordance with your circular memorandum No. 111 of the 5th January 1877, received by me on the 17th of that month, I have the honour to forward for the information of the Surgeon General such facts regarding the prevalence of leprosy in this district as I have been able to gather since the receipt of the above- mentioned circular. The original circular dated 17th April 1875 (Surgeon General's No. 12) was overlooked by me during the pressure of work in 1875, entailed by the endemic fever relief operations. I may mention, however, that I have submitted two special annual reports on leprosy and the lepers under treatment in the Burdwan Leper Jail. I would refer to these reports as giving details regarding individual cases of lepers from this district. I regret extremely that the preparation of all my other sanitary, dispensary and jail reports, which occupies fully the first two months of the year, renders it impossible for me to submit the full report urgently called for without neglecting other equally important work. I have ascertained approximately the number of lepers in the district and the villages in which they live, and will indicate those villages and thannahs where the number appears excessive. To go fully, however, into the special peculiarities of these localities and the special circumstances of these lepers would be impossible
?(2) without my having visited these localities expressly for this purpose. The budget grant for my travelling expenses was so reduced for the year 1876-77 that I have been unable even to inspect most of my dispensaries and sub-divisions since the commencement of the year 1876-77, much less undertake on the receipt of the circular visits to localities affected with leprosy. I have ascertained that out of a population of 2,030,000 in the Burdwan District, inhabiting 5,181 villages or towns, 4,915 persons in 1,885 villages are classed as lepers. I say "classed" because I am certain that many cases of secondary and tertiary syphilis are looked upon by the natives of this part of the country as leprosy. Many lepers that I have examined have attributed the out- break of their symptoms to syphilis or to salivation for the cure of syphilis, and a great confusion of the two diseases exists in the minds of most natives of this district. We may, therefore. fairly consider that amongst these 4,915 cases are a considerable number of persons suffering not from leprosy but from syphilis, and put them against those lepers whose symptoms, if merely those of ansthetic leprosy without eruption, are as yet unrecognized by their neighbours. This number gives a percentage of 0.24 of the total population. The highest percentages in any individual thannahs are 58 and 55 in Raksha and Raneeguge and the lowest .02, 0.04 and 05 in Jehanabad, Culna and Raynah. The annexed statement shews the names of the thannahs in the district, their population and number of villages, as well as the number of villages in which lepers are found, the number and percentage of lepers and the names of villages in which more than ten lepers are said to be found. Roughly the greatest percentages of cases appear to exist in the portions of the district on or bordering on the laterite soil and jungle lands, while the smallest percentages are found in the thannahs in the South and East of the district compris- ing the alluvial lands lying between and near the great rivers. Percentage of lepers amoungst Mussulmans 13 Ditto            ditto Hindus   25 The Mussulman lepers are to Hindu lepers as one to eight nearly, while the census returns shew 347,766 Mussulmans to 1,682,059 Hindus in Burdwan, prov- ing that the disease is less common amongst Mussulmans than amongst Hindus. The proportion of females affected was not stated in all the returns; but out of 3,015 lepers 564 were females, or about one to every five males affected. In the annexed statement I have given the names of the villages in each thannah in which more than ten lepers are to be found. Should it be deemed necessary special inqui- ries may be made in such villages as are reported to contain many lepers. I can at present give no information regarding the special peculiarities of such localities or any special conditions under which the people in these localities live favourable to the continuation or propagation of the disease, no opportunity in the ordinary course of my duty having offered itself for the acquirement of such information. With regard to the propagation of the disease either by contagion or hereditary taint, I may mention here that amongst 30 lepers whose cases were detailed in my annual reports on leprosy dated July 1875 and 1876, I only found thirteen who acknowledged to any hereditary history of the disease. Of the 30 ten acknowledged to having had syphilis and twelve denied both syphilis and hereditary leprosy. As regards contagion, of the 30 only one man attributed his disease to having lived with other lepers and denied hereditary taint; but as he also stated that in his village (in Beerbhoom) there were ten or twelve other lepers out of a population of one hundred or so, the denial of hereditary taint is almost worthless. In my opinion I have seen nothing in the cases of leprosy that have come under my observation to support the popular idea that the disease is contagious, and the minute pathology of the disease, shewn by recent observers to be a disease of the nerve trunks, is strongly against any such theory. The purely tubercular form of the disease is much more rare than the ansthetic. Of the 30 cases treated in the Burdwan Leper Jail between July 1874 and July 1876 only two were of pure tubercular leprosy, or 6.6 per cent. In addition to the 30 cases treated there were several other convicts suffering from slight degree of ansthetic leprosy whom. I did not judge proper to relegate to the leper ward But without a personal examination of all the lepers in the district I can only assert, as a matter of opinion, that (1) the ansthetic form of the disease is many times more common than the tubercular form; (2) that the disease is chiefly propagated by hereditary taint, appearing usually in adults; (3) and that the disease is very pre- valent in some parts of the Burdwan District.

?( 4 ) No. 352, dated Soory, the 22nd June 1877. From-A. FITZGIBBON, Esq., Offg. Civil Medical Officer. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Presidency Circle. IN compliance with your circular memorandum No. 111, dated the 5th January last, I have the honour to submit the following remarks on leprosy, viz., that it is not confined to any particular locality, but is to be found more or less in all parts of the district. There are in all about 2,872 persons of both sexes affected with this disease as will be seen by the table inserted below : Names of thannahs. Male lepers. Female lepers. Total. Burwan 147 19 166 Bhulpur 412 81 493 Doobrajpur 628 126 754 Labpur 209 30 239 Mouressur 382 78 460 Rajnuggur 126 23 149 Sacoolipur 122 23 145 Soory 374 82 456 Total 2,410 462 2,872 There are three forms of leprosy recognized in this district, viz., (a) tuber- cular, (b) ansthetic, (c) vesiculating variety : (a)-This form of leprosy commences with thickening lividity and loss of sensation in the skin of some part of the face or extremities. The cheeks and ears and nose are most often the seats of it, but other parts do not escape. As the disease advances, the face becomes swollen, ears lobulated, nose depressed and flattened from necrosis of the nasal septum, the hairs on the upper lip and chin and eyebrows fall off. In a still more advanced stage the skin of parts of the face, trunk and extremities is often covered with small tubercles collected in groups, and not unfrequently superficial ulcers are seen upon the ears and extremities. Enlarge- ment of the lymphatic glands is not uncommon. Fissures and ulceration occur in the knuckles at the heels or on the soles of the feet, and loss of parts takes place by sloughing and necrosis commencing at the joints, rather than by interstitial absorption ; but both processes may go on simultaneously. The sufferer at last sinks from exhaustion, or is destroyed by a bowel affection. (b)-This variety is usually noticed at the commencement with impairment of the tactile senses, with inability to appreciate difference of temperature, and other kinds of irritation in the face, ears and extremities, which is followed by the appearance of one or more patches of discolouration of the skin on any part of the body. These patches are lighter in colour than the surrounding skin, and attended with loss of sensation. This, the early stage of the disease, may continue for a variable period ; but it is sooner or later followed by atrophy or wasting and inters- titial absorption of the deeper-seated tissues. The hands and feet become distorted and altered in shape, and not unfrequently numerous small bulle form, especially at the extremities of the toes and fingers ; these burst and re-appear, and sometimes lead to the formation of ulcers. An ulcer on the sole of the foot is often traced to a bulle ; the interstitial absorption, as already mentioned, commences at the end of the fingers and toes, and phalanx after phalanx is destroyed. In the progress of the disease extensive sloughing ulcers, which often clean and heal, are apt to form. Along with the local changes just noticed there is more or less cachexia, and, indeed, a cachetic state often precedes the local manifestation of the disease. In the more advanced stages there is much emaciation, muscular power is impaired, the organs of special sense are blunted, ulcers of all sizes and in various conditions are seen upon the body and limbs, the hairs fall off, irregular accession of fever
?(5) (hectic) are common, the appetite is lost, and the patient sinks from exhaustion, or is carried off by diarrha or a local inflammation. (c)-A pure case of this variety is very rare. The ulcerative process is preced- ed by the formation of blisters on the fingers and toes, and sometimes on the palms of the hands and plantar aspect of the feet. The blisters burst, exposing very unhealthy looking ulcers which heal very slowly, and are followed by contrac- tion of the parts upon which they were situated. After repeated crops of these blisters the fingers and toes fall off, then other symptoms of leprous cachexia appear, and the patient is carried off in the manner already described. No. 55, dated Hooghly, the 30th October 1877. From-The Offg. Civil Surgeon, Hooghly. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Presidency Circle. WITH reference to your memorandum No. 3173, dated the 29th instant, I have the honour to inform you that leprosy is very rare in this district. The few cases that have come under notice are chiefly professional beggars coming to implore for alms. The Hindus in the Sanskrit works state four forms of the disease. I have seen only two varieties; in short, they are the same only in different stages. In one the disease commences with tingling sensation of a patch or patches of skin in several places, which become benumbed or insensible, and the colouring pigment of the skin is removed, the part assumes a peculiar appearance tending to a pink or reddish hue; the skin becomes thickened, and thus the affected part appears circular; ultimately the tip of the nose and the lobes of the ears and the skin of the eyebrows become swollen and reddish, and the ends of the fingers and toes, specially the big toe, gets painful and flattened, swollen and become of reddish hue; and in some the disease remains stationary in this stage for years, and even till death of the patient, or the disease advances to ulceration and loss of joints. The ulceration generally commences in the toes and fingers first, and as it advances the joints of the fingers and toes are separated. A sort of serum, like discharge, exudes through the ulcerated part, and the regular pus is not formed. When healthy pus is discharged from the ulcer, it is generally considered that the ulceration stops and healing commences. The other variety is of the same nature in the first stage, but in the second stage dry gangrene sets in on the toes, in the finger or fingers, and toe or toes, and it proceeds as far as where the ulceration commences; and if the progress of the disease is to stop, then healthy pus is seen, and the gangrene part is separated and the ulceration heals up with healthy granulations. I have seen in several cases the toes and the rest of the foot fall off by dry gangrene in this way of the ankle where the ulceration commenced and healed up. 2. The disease is generally observed to commence between the age of 25 and 50, but it has appeared in earlier years, but never seen by me to begin above the age of 50. The earliest manifestations are the tingling and benumbed state of the skin of some parts, or the swelling of the tip of the nose, lobes of the ears and its reddish hue, with or without insensibility of the parts. I have seen the full development of the disease generally in adult age and in some cases before puberty; I have rarely seen any case to prove fatal. I have seen more lepers among men than in women, and more among Muhammadans than among Hindus; but it is hard for me to give the exact proportion of it. The leprosy is more frequently seen in the lower order of the people, such as beggars; but the disease has been seen among the richest also, and it appears to spare no con- dition of life. In the District of Hooghly there is no place where it is common; therefore, I cannot say what locality favours its growth or where it occurs most. It has been equally seen in all sorts of climate and places. The sanitary conditions of the dwellings of the inhabitants of this district are nearly all alike, and there is nothing peculiar in any part of the district deserv- ing mention. The habits of life as to personal cleanliness, I can say that the Hindus of this district are generally most clean, daily bathing and washing their clothes and utensils and rooms; but the Muhammadans, excepting those who are in good condition, are not comparatively so clean as their Hindu brothers. They do not bathe, wash and clean every day. The diet of the people are in general vegetables, milk, fish and ghee. In addi- tion to these the Muhammadans at times eat meat. Their mode of living, excepting a few young Bengalis, is very temperate; they touch neither wine nor stimulating liquor of any sort; they are in general a race of cultivators. B
?( 6 ) The disease is hereditary; I have invariably seen the children of a leper become lepers, and one thing is peculiar-that the children of the leper generally get the leprosy at the age of the parent when he first got the disease. I have seen one member of a family to be affected while other members remained free from it ; but the man who had the disease generally ascribed to his association with lepers. I have seen several cases of the leprosy arise as if it were the after-consequences of the syphilis. I have every reason to believe the disease to be contagious. I have seen a wife with her two children contract the disease by remaining with her husband after he had the disease on him, while three other children who left him for the disease remained free. The disease of this man had not advanced to this stage of ulcera- tion. I know a boy who became a leper after having bought a pigeon from a leper, and constantly handling it, though his parents were free from the disease, and he had no communication with any other leper. I have seen two healthy strong good constitutional men having no hereditary tendency for the disease become lepers after a year's attendance on the lepers in a leper asylum. One was attendant to supply food from the bazaar, and the other was a water-bearer in the leper asylum. I cannot say whether sexual intercourse alone can give the disease or not; but when contact gives it, as a matter of course, the sexual intercourse must communicate. In the District of Hooghly lepers are not allowed to mix freely with the rest of the commonalty. The people shun a leper of their own accord, as they have a general belief on the contagion of it. There is no leper asylum in the district; in fact, it is not needed in the place, as there are very few lepers in the country. No. 3216, dated Fort William, the 1st November 1877.

Memorandum No. 128, dated Serampore, the 16th March 1877. BEGS to submit report on leprosy in this sub-division. JAMES GREENE, M. D., Civil Medical Officer, Serampore. To the Deputy Surgeon General, Presidency Circle. Report on leprosy in the Sub-Division of Serampore. SERAMPORE is a sub-division of the Hooghly District. The town of Serampore is situated on the right bank of the River Hooghly; the sub-division consists of five thannahs which are situated between two rivers, viz., the Damoodur on the West and Hooghly on the East. The area of the whole sub-division is 350 square miles ; it contains 815 villages, with a total population of 393,864. The soil is alluvial, sandy on the surface, and black clay beneath. The following table shows the population of each thannah with the number of lepers in each :  POPULATION. LEPERS. THANNAHS. Christians. Hindus. Muhammadans. Other classes. Total. Hindus.

?(7) The disease as seen here does not differ in any respect from the description found in books. I have seen it in the early stages in two forms: First, circular raised copper-coloured spots; when these spots are pinched, the skin feels thick; these spots are numb at first, and gradually become insensible. Second variety consists of mot- tling of the skin of the face, hands and feet, gradually extending to the trunk; the patches are lighter in colour than the surrounding skin and are generally circular, often edged with a red border; the skin of face becomes coarse, thick and granular like the rind of an orange; the lips, nose and ears appear thick and larger than natural; eyebrows look heavy. As the disease advances the voice gets husky, hair thins and falls off; the patches gradually become quite insensible. Ulcers form with thick cartilaginous edges, and pale shining surface, discharge water. These ulcers often heal, leaving white shining contracted cicatrices. When these ulcers are situated on the hands and feet the fingers and toes drop off. Flexors of extremi- ties often contract, causing fingers and toes to be permanently bent. The whole skin of body becomes scaly, and the sufferers look older than they usually are. Death generally takes place from diarrha and exhaustion. The muscles are found wasted and pale with the cellular tissue converted into a gelatinous substance in various parts of the body. Causes.-I have no doubt that leprosy is propagated by sexual intercourse, as I have seen several instances at the Serampore Hospital, when the disease was acquired in this way and mistaken at first for venereal. Diet has also a great deal to do with its production; most of the sufferers are from the homeless classes, beggars, &c., who live by begging, and it is well known that these people are sup- plied with grain of the cheapest and worst kind. Grain dealers, as a rule, set aside damaged and worm-eaten grain for distribution to this class; they seldom get animal food, living principally on diseased grain and vegetables with a taste of rotten fish occasionally. As far as my observation extends, climate does not seem to have any great influence in the production of the disease, though there is no doubt that the disease is one of tropical origin. JAMES GREENE, M. D. Civil Medical Officer, Serampore. No. 67, dated Howrah, the 5th May 1877. From-Surgeon Major J. G. PILCHER, M. D., Civil Surgeon of Howrah. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Presidency Circle. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your circular memorandum No. 111 of the 5th January, and annexures, calling for a report on the prevalence of leprosy in this district, and the circumstances attending its occurrence, also for a clinical history of the disease as observed in this part of the Province. I have only been three months in charge of the district, and I have been unable to make myself acquainted with the subject of leprosy. From personal observation, therefore, I can record few facts regarding the special forms or charac- teristics of the disease as seen in Howrah. In the municipality very few cases of the disease are seen at the dispensary partly owing to the nearness of the larger city and the greater ease with which the destitute leper can obtain support from the charitable, partly also from the fewer number of cases of real leprosy, if I am correctly informed, in this district in com- parison with others. No. 32 E, dated Calcutta, the 11th June 1877. Endorsed by the Deputy Surgeon General, Presidency Circle. FORWARDED to the Secretary to the Surgeon General, Indian Medical Depart- ment, with reference to Surgeon General's Office circular memorandum No. 134, dated 20th December last, and in continuation of this Office memorandum No. 29 E, dated the 7th instant. No. 162, dated Bankoora, the 9th June 1877. From-Babu B. L. DUTT, M. D., Civil Surgeon of Bankoora. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Presidency Circle. IN compliance with your circular memorandum No. 111 of the 5th January 1877, I have the honour to submit a report on the leprosy prevailing in this district. My short experience of the district and the want of satisfactory notes of the disease enable me only to give a short and imperfect account.
?(8) 2. Leprosy is a common affection in this district. It is generally limited to the poorer classes, and is infrequently seen in the well-fed and the rich. The Bow- rees and Sonthal castes suffer most, and the dark-skinned are more prone to the disease than the fair-skinned, but this may be due to the greater preponderance of the former over the latter. The pure Aryan, as represented by the high caste Brahmin, is least susceptible to the disease-a fact borne out by my limited observations in the Burdwan Leper Hospital and Pooree District. The pure or somewhat mixed aboriginal as the Sonthal or the Bowree caste is, on the other hand, most susceptible as hereinbefore observed, and the intermediate castes appear to be more or less liable to the disease in proportion to the aboriginal blood in them. This, if proved by an extensive number of accurate observations, will establish an important fact. Out of 800 admissions into the Bankoora Jail in 1876 two were lepers, or 250 per 1,000. 3. Ansthetic form of the disease is the most common, tubercular is rarely seen, but the mixed form is more frequent. Eruption is observed in most cases, attended often with considerable ansthesia or diminished sensation. Atrophic changes, distortion, and finally ulceration and loss of substance of the hands and feet were not absent in a single case I observed in this district. 4. Syphilis, venery, poverty and bad living are great exciting causes of the disease. 5. The treatment adopted in the Bankoora Dispensary was liberal diet, clean- liness, and the continual administration of tonics. Under this plan two of the cases improved, and the progress of the disease rendered slow; but as soon as the treatment was left off, or the patient was reduced in health by febrile attacks or other causes, the disease broke out afresh with renewed vigour. Gurjun oil was tried in 1875 in some of the cases, but the result was not recorded, nor the manner of its administration. 6. Nine cases of leprosy were treated in the in-door hospital in 1876. The details of the cases are kept badly to allow me to determine accurately to what form of the disease each belonged. Eight of them appear to be of the ansthetic variety; they were admitted with ulcerated hands and feet, and more or less diminution of sensation. One died after one year's residence in hospital, one slightly improved and left the hospital after twenty-two days, one is still undergoing treatment and is improving, and the remaining five ceased to attend. No improvements in these cases is recorded. The ninth case appears to be of the tubercular variety, as it is stated that the patient had sores all over the body. He was six days only in hospital. 7. Two lepers were admitted into the Bankoora Jail in 1876: One was re- leased very shortly after, and his case is not recorded; the second was soon trans- ferred to Burdwan; his case was noted in the Burdwan records as one of ansthe- tic leprosy. 8. Twenty-five cases treated in the out-door dispensary, but no record is kept of their varieties. No. 270, dated Midnapur, the 26th March 1877. From-R. L. MATHEW, Esq., Civil Surgeon of Midnapur. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Presidency Circle. I HAVE the honour to forward the following brief remarks regarding leprosy in this district: I have now before me nine reports from the medical subordinates serving in this district, and from their perusal I regret to say hardly any information of a definite character can be procured. The Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Midnapur Dispensary considers leprosy a rare disease amongst the inhabitants of the town and district. There were some 56 cases of leprosy treated in the Charitable Dispensary from the 1st of March 1876 to the end of February 1877. The patients were for the most part pilgrims from the North-West, who only remained for a few days until their strength was recruited, and then proceeded on their way. The Assistant Surgeon does not mention the type of the disease that he most frequently observed, nor does he seem to have made any enquiry as to what cause the disease was attributed, or what part hereditary taint or contagion played in producing it.
(9) Of the 56 cases treated one was said to have been cured, seven relieved, three died, and 45 ceased to attend. The Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Mysadul Charitable Dispensary sub- mits a very brief report stating that no cases of true leprosy were treated in the dispensary durig the period to which the report refers. He considers leprosy a very rare disease in the district, and that the five cases simulating this disease, which were treated in the hospital during the year, were really syphilitic affections that had been injudiciously treated with mercury by kobirajes. The Native Doctor in charge of the Ghattal Dispensary seems to have made some effort to procure information, and gives the details of few cases that came under his treatment during the past year. The disease in three of these cases was due to hereditary influence, and in two was said to have been caused by contagion. He reports that milkmen, washermen, weavers and silk-spinners are the classes most frequently attacked. He does not mention the number of cases treated during the year, nor does he seem to think that the inhabitants of any one locality are specially liable to the disease. The other reports from the various quarters of the district are not worth quoting separately. It is, however, apparent that leprosy does not prevail in the district to any marked extent. During the last six years I visited twice and again nearly every quarter of the district, and I never saw many cases of this disease. Occasionally at the charitable dispensary same cases have presented them- selves terribly mutilated by this loathsome complaint; but as reported by the Assistant Surgeon, they were seldom inhabitants of the town or district, but generally unhappy creatures who were expelled from their homes on account of their condition, and who made their way here on a begging pilgrimage to Pooree, the ravages of the disease being greatly accelerated by the want and exposure incidental to the journey. Since my return I have had neither time nor opportunity to make any special enquiry regarding this disease; but I have always considered that hereditary taint was the principal source from which it can be traced. Whether contagion plays an active part in disseminating the disease appears doubtful; but the vast majority of the people here consider it contagious, and will not, as a rule, hold any communication with persons so affected. No. 11, dated Midnapur, the 22nd March 1877. From-Babu ROMESH CHUNDER GUPTO, Assistant Surgeon, Midnapur. To-The Civil Surgeon of Midnapur. WITH reference to your circular memorandum No. 33, dated 15th January 1877, I have the honour to state that 56 lepra cases were treated in the Midnapur Charitable Dispensary from 1st March 1876 to end of February 1877, of which one cured, seven relieved, three died, and 45 ceased to attend. Leprosy is rather rare among the people of this district. The cases that came under my treatment were mosty up-country men. They, on their pilgrimage to Juggunath, get fatigued and disabled to walk any more, and when they arrive the station they resort to the hospital. I invariably used gurjun oil both internally and externally in the treatment of leprosy, and found that, under its use for a length of time not less than two months, the sores on the fingers and toes got more or less healed. No lepra case remained under treatment for a longer time to enable me to know the full effect of the drug in this disease. No. 4, dated Ghattal, the 20th February 1877. From-Babu RAJCUMAR Doss, Native Doctor in charge of Ghattal Dis- pensary. To-The Civil Surgeon of Midnapur. I HAVE the honour to submit my report on the distribution and causation of leprosy within the precincts of this town and its immediate neighbourhood. c
(10 ) From careful investigation I have come to the conclusion that the disease was contracted in two ways-primarily and secondarily. In primary attacks the disease had its origin from syphilitic disorders with an injudicious administration of mercurials by Native quacks. In secondary cases it has either occurred by contagion or hereditary influence. Most of the cases examined were milkmen, washermen, weavers and Koibortos, depending on cocoon cultivation, all of whom are to deal with dirty things for the sustenance of their lives. For your observation I would insert my notes on a few cases of leprosy which might serve though an imperfect idea of the way in which it occurred. Mookhoda Churn Gooi, a weaver-boy, aged 12 years, got the disease by here- ditary influence. States that his mother's maternal uncle and a nephew had this disease. This shows that the disease had made its influence after an interval of one step. It is a case of congenital white leprosy. 2. Goopi Nath Ghose, Hindu, male, aged 35 years, milkman by profession, attacked with leprosy since eight years. Gets blisters in the hands and feet which become ulcerated; states that his eldest brother had the disease, with whom he would lie down or take his food. 3. Kataini, aged 36 years, got the disease since her 13 years' age. She is the sister to the said Goopi Nath, and has contracted the disease in the way in which her brother did. Her fingers and toes have become shortened and ulcerated, and the aloe of the nose thickened and depressed. 4. Lal Chand Shome, Hindu, male, aged 25 years, labourer by profession, states that he gets ulcers in consequence of self-formed blisters in the left arm and hand, whereon there is no sensation. This has occurred by contagion from another man, with whom he used to work and sleep together. 5. Bama Dhobi, washerwoman, aged 25 years, attacked with leprosy since five years. Had syphilis before. Gets ulcers on all parts of her body, especially in the extremities. Might have contracted the disease by washing clothes of persons suffering from similar ailment. 6. Gopaul Morol, aged 16 years, Hindu, male, milkman by profession, has got patches of white leprosy all over the body since the last three years; cannot say whether his forefathers had any such disease or not.

IN compliance with your memorandum No. 177, dated the 5th instant, direct- ing me to report on the spread of leprosy in this quarter of the district, as well as on its probable cause of origin, I beg to inform you that true cases of leprosy with hereditary taint and special peculiarities to the locality in which the people live are wanting here. In the course of a year a very scanty number of patients, such as four or five, attacked with ulcers simulating leprosy, are found to attend the dispensary; in most of these cases it is found on enquiry that they suffered from venereal disease, acute rheumatism, or from any foul ulcer, for the cure of which they made bad use of mercurial preparations in the hands of quacks before the leprous ulcers broke out. In this quarter the abuse of mercury even in simple diseases tends to the development of ulcers simulating leprosy. No. 8, dated Chandrakona, the 27th February 1877. From-Babu SITANATH GUPTO, Native Doctor. To-The Civil Surgeon of Midnapur. IN accordance to your circular memorandum No. 33, dated 15th January 1877, I have the honour to state that cases of true leprosy here are very rare. There is only one case under my treatment. The patient states that he was attacked with syphilis some 22 years before, and he freed himself from the disease with the use of mercurious vapour bath. But two years after this, i e., some 20 years
?(11) ago, a variety of eruptions appeared on the dorsal surface of the right hand; this was accompanied with local ansthesia of the part. The eruptions healed with the local use of some Native oil, but the ansthesia still exists. Six months subsequent to this surrul ulcers appeared on the ends of fingers and toes, and symptoms of true leprosy began to appear gradually. On enquiry I came to know that besides this there are two other cases here at Chandrakona; they all appear to be of syphilitic origin. From-Babu MODHOO MADHUB MOOKERJEE, Native Doctor, Charitable Dispensary, Contai. To-The Civil Surgeon of Midnapur. REFERENCE with your memorandum No. 175 of 5th instant, I have the honour to report about lepra as following: The lepra is a disease of the skin; it has two forms, tuberculated and non-tuberculated, the latter is the usual case in Bengal. As far as my knowledge goes, this disease is neither contagious nor infectious, it is rather hereditary. If it be contagious or infectious, then it would have occurred among all the prisoners in the jail, as I have seen several cases of lepra patients in the Hooghly and Hazaribagh Jails where they live with other healthy prisoners. Some say the cause of the disease is uncleanliness and dirty, but I am not of that opinion. It is very difficult to relate the detailed description of the disease for me whose knowledge is limited, and who is serving under for few months. The gurjun oil treatment is the best for this disease. This oil can be used both externally and internally mixed with lime water. No. 6, dated Tumlook, the 20th February 1877.

WITH reference to your circular memorandum No, 33, dated the 15th January 1877, in continuation of circular memorandum No. 134, dated the 20th December 1876, of the Officiating Secretary to the Surgeon General, India, Medical Depart- ment, I have the honour to inform you that leprosy exists in Tumlook Sub-Division in a very small extent according to my experience of the last year during which I had treated only fourteen patients labouring under leprosy, who were inhabitants of different villages. Among them two persons seemed to have got the disease from contagion, seven persons from hereditary taint, and five persons from other unknown causes. No. 8, dated Gurbetta, the 1st March 1877. From-Babu PROSUNNO COOMAR SEIN, Native Doctor. To-The Civil Surgeon of Midnapur. WITH reference to your memorandum No. 33, tated the 15th January last, I have the honour to submit the following information: In spite of my continual exertions for last few days I could not gather any particular information as to the extent to which leprosy exists among the people of this thannah; but so far I am certain that this disease is prevalent to a certain extent among the people of the village of Gurbetta. The cause is I think-this place is comparatively crowded, and as the pilgrim road passes through it, it is the haunt of the persons from the different parts of India who bring with them the contagion of many sorts of diseases. After my taking charge of this dispensary I have treated 20 lepers. To some of them this disease was hereditary, to some it was owing to the contagion, and to others it was the effect of using mercurial medicines.
(12) Memorandum No. 6, dated Golegram, the 23rd February 1877. THE undersigned is directed to acknowledge the receipt of your circular memorandum No. 33 of 15th January 1877; that he finds out within four miles square about leprosy in only two neighbouriug villages. Only two cases are seen to live, one of them inhabitant of Bolegoori, whose disease has arisen from hereditary cause, and only last two years he is attacked by the disease, and the other is inhabitant of Coowapat, who was attacked by the disease on his forty-fifth year of age, and he is quite unable to give his own history, and also stated that he is unacquainted with the cause of the disease, and in his childhood he lost his father and mother; and afterwards I have taken further inquiries about him from his neigh- bours, who were quite unacquainted with the cause of his disease. This diseased person now being fifty-five years of age and strongly suffers day by day. KESHUB CHUNDRA MUKERJEE, Native Doctor in charge of Golegram Charitable Dispensary.

IN reply to your circular memorandum No. 33, I beg to state that there few leprosy cases in these countries. Searching the neighbouring villages, I have found two leprosy of a father and his son, the cause of which I found is to be heredi- tary. Report on the prevalence of Leprosy in the District of Moorshedabad. LEPROSY exists in an unusual degree in Moorshedabad, which stands fourth in the list of districts in the Provinces of Bengal, Behar and Orissa, as well as of Assam. Beerbhum is at the head of the list. Then come Bancoorah and Burdwan, and Moorshedabad is next. 2. Among a total population of 1,353,626, there were in the year 1872 1,776 lepers, namely, 1,534 males and 242 females, giving a percentage on total popula- tion of leper males 2377, leper females 0342-total.1312. From inquiry and in- formation conducted and collected by me it appears that there has been no material change in the proportion of lepers among the population of the district during the last five years. For all practical purposes, therefore, we might accept the statistics collected by Mr. Beverley in 1872 as applicable also to the present time. 3.  The male portion of the population of this district, like that of other parts of India, suffer from leprosy greatly in excess of the female.  The normal popula- tion shows a considerable excess  of females-the figures being males 645,335, females 708,291-and yet the proportion of male lepers to female lepers is 633 to 1. This preponderance of male lepers seems peculiar to India, for, according to Dr. Carter, such predominance does not exist in Norway, Jamaica and other parts of the world where leprosy in unusually prevalent. 4.  As far as my knowledge of the lepers of this district extends,  it appears that the disease is more common among the Muhammadans than the  Hindus.  My opportunities, however, of collecting information from personal observation regard- ing leprosy has been necessarily limited to a small portion of the district.  It must therefore be understood that the conclusion I have arrived at on this  point is based on those cases only which  have come under my personal observation, and not on the condition of the whole leper population of the district. 5.  Leprosy is spread in a greater or lesser degree throughout the district, as lepers are found within the jurisdiction of every thannah.  It exists, however, to a far greater extent among the people who reside in that portion of the district which
( 13 ) lies on the West of the River Bhageeruthee. From the following table it will be seen that the twelve thannahs situated on the East of the River Bhageeruthee, with a total population of 612,203, have only 403 lepers. Whereas the thirteen thannahs on the West of that river, with a total population of 741,423, have no less than 1,373 lepers. Names of thannahs on the East of the River. Total population. LEPERS.

But there is a marked difference in the natural formation of the country, the soil of the one being totally different from that of the other. The District of Moorshedabad is divided into two somewhat unequal portions by the River Bhageeruthee, which flows through it in a South-Easterly direction. The country on the right bank (that is on the West of the river) is undulating, and generally well raised above the highest flood level of the river ; and the soil in its composition is decidedly laterite, and resembles that of the plains of Upper Bengal. Directly the river is crossed the change is unmistakeably marked. The surface of the country is generally below high flood level, and the soil is composed of sand and sand mixed with clay, and is, in fact, identical with that of the Gangetic delta. The undulations disappear, except where old beds of the river occur, and a flat country takes its place. I have stated in the early part of this report that Beerbhum heads the list of districts in Bengal, Behar, Orissa and Assam in which leprosy exists to an un- usual extent. With a total population of 695,921 there are in that district 2,872 lepers, giving a percentage of 4127 on total population ; and it is deserving of remark that there are more lepers among the people who reside within the jurisdic- tion of the five thannahs in this district-Bhurutpur, Khurgram, Ramporehaut, Nulhati and Pulsa-which border on Beerbhum, than there are among the whole population of the remaining twenty thannahs. 6. As to the supposed causes of leprosy my experience does not tend to the belief that the disease is contagious in its nature unless by direct inoculation, and even then we are not necessarily in possession of sufficient evidence of crucial D
(14) test to enable us to say positively that the disease would be transmitted from one person to another by means of direct inoculation. On the other hand, there is no doubt that in a certain proportion of cases the cause of leprosy can be satisfactorily traced to heredity. Making, however, full allowance for these cases, there still remain a large number of cases which, in the absence of any other known cause, must be admitted to have engendered sponta- neously; and for the origin of these cases we must look to some other causes. On the whole, I am inclined to the opinion that endemic influences cannot be altogether absolved of a certain share in the production of leprosy. At all events, I think the facts I have given in this report sufficiently justify such an opinion, and suggest full and searching investigation in this direction. 7. It would be beyond the object of this report to include in it any informa- tion I may have to submit regarding the treatment of leprosy with gurjun oil. I shall therefore submit a separate brief report on the subject. S. M. SHIRCORE, Civil Surgeon, Moorshedabad. No. 113, dated Nya Dumka, the 16th March 1877. From-Z. A. AHMED, Esq., M. D., Offg. Civil Surgeon, S. P. Dumka. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Dinapore Circle. WITH reference to your circular memorandum No. 123 of the 29th December last, forwarding Surgeon General's No. 134 of 20th idem, I have the honour to report that it appears from the census report of 1872 that there are 515 lepers in this district, or, in other words, 0408 per cent. of the population are lepers. Out of this number 314 lepers were returned from Dumka and Jamtarrah Sub-Divisions, principally from the villages bordering the District of Beerbhum. These are chiefly Bengali villages. As a rule, the Bengali villages are crammed with houses with defective drainage and ventilation. The cowdung, house refuses and other sorts of filth are piled up close to the house in these villages. These are the main peculiarities of these villages. The sufferers are chiefly poor and low class people who remain overcrowded in small huts which scarcely protect from the rain and the inclements of the weather. During my inspections of the villages from which the largest number of cases were returned, I examined 59 cases in twelve villages, and found that in 30 cases the disease was propagated by hereditary transmission. In one case a woman got the disease about two years after her husband, from which it appears that it was produced by cohabitation. Of the 38 remaining cases only four were attributed to syphilis and the use of mercury. Fish is scarce in the villages where leprosy is prevalent, and it cannot be traced that the use of putrid fish has anything to do in the causation of the disease in the parts of this district where it is prevalent. The poor people who subsist chiefly on rice, dall (kalaey, khesari, &c.) and sag suffer most from the disease. I have seen only very few cases of leprosy among the Sonthals, and I believe it is not so common among them as among the Bengalis, I mean the low class Hindus and Mussulmans. This may be probably owing to the difference of food, mode of life and better hygienic condition of the Sonthal villages. It will appear from the enclosed statements that the proportion of male lepers were little more than three times than the females, and the ansthetic variety of the disease is more common in the district. Treatment.-Dr. Dougall's plan of treatment with gurjun oil was not so successful in my hand (in the few cases I tried) or in any of my subordinates in this district. The mode of treatment cannot be successfully tried among the out-door patients of the dispensary, as their attendance is not regular, and they disappear from the dispensary getting tired of the treatment after a short time.

(17) No. 92, dated Kishnaghur, the 13th April 1877. From-C. E. W. BENSLEY, Esq., M. D., Civil Surgeon of Nuddea. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Presidency Circle. I HAVE the honour to submit the following report on leprosy called for in your circular memorandum No. 111, dated the 5th January 1877. It is but rarely that cases of leprosy come for treatment to our hospitals. My observations being confined to cases which are ordinarily met with, I am hardly in a position to state the extent to which the disease prevails in this district; but from such observations as I have been able to make, I can safely say that the disease does not prevail to any very great extent here. There is only one place, viz., Santipur, where the number of lepers seem to be comparatively greater than in any other part of the district. There is also another point which should be noticed here, viz., that the disease is mnch more common among Muhammadans than among Hindus. From the cases that have come under my observation it seems to me that hereditary taint and the abuse of mercury in venereal diseases are the two main causes of this disease. Of these two, again, the latter appears to be the more common. Constant association might be the cause of the disease in some cases, but I am hardly in a position to give a definite opinion in the point. The cases which came to the charitable dispensary for treatment were all treated with gurjun oil. A marked improvement was perceptible at first in a few of the cases, but the symptoms re-appeared soon after the patients discontinued to use the medicine. There is one great drawback to the examination of the result of the treatment, and it is that no patient is patient enough to use the medicine for any considerable length of time. No. 286, dated Bauleah, the 3rd April 1877. From-E. C. BENSLEY, Esq., Civil Surgeon of Rajshahye. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Presidency Circle. IN obedience to the orders of Government, I have the honour to submit a report on leprosy; but as the disease exists in a very spare form in this district, giving me and my subordinates little or no opportunity for studying the disease, I am afraid the information that I have been able to collect will be of little or no value. The census report of 1872 shows that in the Rajshahye District there were altogether 274 lepers. Taking these figures as accurately representing cases of actual leprosy, the proportion that they would bear to the population would be as 1 to 4,783-a proportion that sinks into insignificance when compared with other dis- tricts where the proportion ranges from 1 to 5 per 1,000 of the population. Doubt- less the census figures of lepers are not strictly accurate. In the first place it is a dis- ease which the people try to keep out of sight as much as possible, those only who are actually maimed by the disease being brought to notice, and, again, the returns for females would be defective, because of the zenana system prohibiting any strict scrutiny. I do not think it has anywhere been shown that males suffer more from the disease than females, and yet the census returns show 229 of the former against only 45 of the latter. These, then, are circumstances that would tend to understate the facts; but, on the other hand, there is no question whatever that a large number of the census cases were cases of a cutaneous affections popularly known as "white leprosy", which is not leprosy at all. If these, then, were eliminated, and an allowance made for failure in recording female cases, I imagine the figures would not vary much from what they at present stand. Lepers, as a rule, represent to a great degree a floating population. They are much on the move, generally visiting places where shrines and holy places exist. In the District of Bhraich, in Oudh, there is a temple and a small pool of water which are visited yearly by a very large number of lepers. In the season these lepers, to the number of 30 or 40, may be seen closely packed in the pool with their heads above water and about the same number or more round the pool ready to jump in directly vacancies occur; the water all the time being filthily dirty and highly offensive. The pool of water is said to be blessed by the Brahmins and to possess curative properties. In Rajshahye there are no shrines that are frequented by lepers, the consequence is that those that are seen here are the usual residents of the place. E
(18) Considering that the several thannahs of this district possess no special geo- graphical or climatal characters to distinguish them from one another, it does appear strange that the numbers returned by the several thannahs should present such striking differences. Nattore and Lallpur Thannahs show a large number; but I have frequently visited these thannahs and have never once noticed any lepers. The Rajshahye Jail, which is a central one, and contains long-termed prisoners from all the jails of this division, had only one case of leprosy, and he was released in December last. With the few opportunities that I have had of studying the disease, I am unable to enter into the causes that predispose to the disease. I think it is allowed on all sides that poverty, filth and impoverished diet are not important factors of the disease; and popular notion exists among the Natives that a fish diet produces the disease and aggravates it when it exists. I know that the prisoner above referred to begged of me to cut off his allowance of fish and to give him ghee instead. The leprosy that this man was suffering from was of the ansthetic form; he had had it for upwards of two years. It was confined to the face, ears and the upper extremities; some dimness of vision was complained of, and the edges of the eyelids were always more or less thickened and reddish; the sense of touch was also blunted. The man was about 38 years of age. He was a widower, his wife having died two or three years before the disease commenced. He could trace no family history of the disease either in his own or in his wife's family. By occupation he was an agriculturist, and by caste a Mussulman. I should say here that there was some cracking of the skin on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet, and he informed me that the disease first com- menced with these fissurings. The Natives all believe in the disease being contagious; and this man was so impressed with this belief, as also with the loathsomeness of the disease, that he begged of me to keep him apart from the rest. This man was treated for a long time with chowlmoogra oil, and latterly with gurjun oil; and although there was no apparent improvement in the disease, the man had improved much in health and the progress of the disease was arrested. He was a native of this district, had never been out of it, and lived on the diet that is usually taken by the poorer classes. No. 82, dated Pubna, the 2nd March 1877. From-H. M. DAVIS, Esq., Civil Surgeon, Pubna. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Presidency Circle. IN reply to your circular No. 111, dated 5th January 1877, I have the honour to state that leprosy has been seldom met with by me in this district. Cases are very rare among the prisoners, at the charitable dispensaries and elsewhere. The Assistant Surgeon in charge of the charitable dispensary, &c., at Serajgunge, states that he is unable to furnish information on the disease, and there are no data in this Office from which a report could be compiled of any practical value. No. 331, dated Darjeeling, the 13th September 1877. From-H. PURVES, Esq., Civil Surgeon, Darjeeling. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Dinapore Circle. WITH reference to your No. 2691 of the 7th instant, I have the honour to reply that it is the exception to see a case of leprosy in these hill tracts, conse- quently the paragraph in the Government circular on the subject stating that leprosy is "lamentably prevalent in Darjeeling" must have occurred through an oversight. Under such circumstances it is obvious that any report on leprosy with special reference to the Darjeeling District would be of little use or interest.
(19) Report on leprosy in the Jalpaiguri District. District.-The district lying under the Bhootan range of hills extends from Assam to the Darjeeling District, a distance of about 90 miles. From the foot of the hills the district extends Southward, with a varying breadth of from 40 to 60 miles. The country is generally level; in the Northern portion or terai covered with dense jungle of wood, cane or grass, and in the South it is one extensive rice-cultivating tract. Population and area.-The population in 1872 amounted to 418,665 over an area of 2,906 square miles. Soil.-The soil is alluvial. Numerous rivers pass from the hills through the district, and it may, as a rule, be considered to be well watered and fertile. Rainfall.-In the North the average annual rainfall amounts to about 145 inches; in the South to 95 inches. Inhabitants of district.-In the terai the inhabitants belong to the Mech tribe. There are also a considerable number of Nepaulese, and some few imported Dhangurs from Sonthal. The Mechs appear, looking to physical conformation, an admixture of the Mongolians and the races of the plains. The South of the district is peopled by Bengalis, Hindustanis, and a mixed breed from the two, and with the hill tribes. Diet.-The people may be considered a rice-feeding population. Flesh and fish with milk, articles of food, are consumed extensively when obtainable. Some of the terai residents are said to be addicted to eating flesh in a putrid form. Rice, as usually found for sale, is of good quality; other and inferior varieties are however much in use. Prevailing diseases in district.-In the district the prevailing diseases are malarial fevers, dysentery, diarrha and resulting complications. About 50 per cent. of the population suffer from malarial cachexia in some form. Skin diseases, tinea and itch are universally prevalent, few of the people being found without one or the other, or frequently both. Elephantiasis of the extremities and scrotum is very common in all parts of the district. Prevalence of leprosy.-Cases of leprosy are to be met with in all parts of the district, and the disease is generally believed to be more common among the Mechs than among the other inhabitants. It is impossible to obtain accurate information as to the exact number affected among a given number of the population, the families in which the disease breaks out concealing it as long as possible; and when concealment is no longer possible, the individuals afflicted are turned out of their homes and allowed to gain a livelihood in the best way they can. All enquiries are met by evasive replies or falsehood, because the fact of there being a leper in the family attaches a social taint to it. In a town with a population of about 4,000 there were known to be five lepers, all residents of the place, and with the disease in an advanced stage; and it is most probable there were other cases with the disease not pronounced enough to be observable. This I would consider could not be looked on as an exceptionable instance. Cases under observation.-During the twelve months I have been in the station only seven cases have come directly under observation and treatment : five were men who had passed their thirtieth year, one a woman about 25 years of age, and the seventh a female child about seven years of age. In none of these cases could a truthful history be obtained concerning family relations, the origin or progress of the disease. In all the disease was in an advanced stage, toes or fingers having dropped off. Propagation of leprosy.-As bearing on the question of communicability of the disease, I give here notes of a case which came under my observation in 1871. A female, aged 28, admitted into hospital with gun-shot wound of right thigh and com- minuted fracture of femur in middle third. Woman well nourished and skin healthy, not related to a leprous family. She was accompanied by husband, aged 35, and two children aged seven and three years. Both children appeared healthy. Husband affected with leprosy, both hands ulcerating; had a brother with same disease. Woman recovered and able to move about; only a small fistulous opening re- mained. This opening now commenced to ulcerate and the skin to crack around, and both feet became affected, ulcerations spreading rapidly. At this period both child- ren were affected, the disease exhibiting itself in the hands. In all the four mem- bers of the family the disease was in rapid progress, when they were lost sight of.
(20) Here it would appear that the disease on account of its manifestation almost simultaneously in three different subjects must have been conveyed in discharges from sores. On the other hand, it is possible it may have been transmitted from husband to wife, and the children inherited it. W. DUNCAN. Civil Surgeon. Report on leprosy, with a history of cases and deductions therefrom. IN connection with the present report, the history of ten reliable cases is given, and the particulars arranged under the following heads : Sex.-More males are afflicted than females; proportion eight to ten of those reported upon. Caste.-Hindus and Muhammadans equally affected. Particular castes of Hindus.-Dhanghur one; Dossad one; Brahmin one; and Gowlas two, that is to say double. The two first approach each other in their habits and mode of life, being animal and vegetable feeders and labouring. The third is a vegetarian and fish-eater and non-labouring; and all Gowlas partake plentifully of milk. Ages.-Chiefly between 30 and 40; one out of the ten 64 years old, and one 20; juveniles none; showing the disease to be peculiar to, and contracted in, adult life and not rapidly fatal. Occupation.-Various, agricultural labourers chiefly three; domestic servants- such as gardener, cartman, grass-cutter, water-carrier, milkman and kidmutgar,- single cases, and one case above the working class. Birth-place and residence.-Native of Moorshedabad one, of Bhagalpur one, of Tirhoot one, of Lahore one, of Purneah six, which are not excessive. Names of the Purneah villages, viz., Ekumba, Kusba, Sousa, Sarsy, and Rambag. Peculiarities.-Of the first four places, open and well cultivated; of the last, or Rambag, uncultivated, wooded and swampy; this place has furnished two cases, the other places one case each. Parentage.-Healthy in nine cases; an hereditary taint on the paternal side traceable in one. Brothers and sisters.-One leper says that he has two brothers-one is diseased, and the other, as well as his parents, are healthy. Married.-Four out of ten. Wives.-Alive, and cohabitation five. Husbands.-Alive, and ditto one. Where husbands are diseased wives are healthy, and vice versa. Progeny of lepers appear not to be numerous. Among the cases cited none had more than three-mostly one and two. The children were born healthy to all appearances, and kept so up to eight years, and even to adult age, but were infected with a diathesis probably capable of development later. There was no issue from one couple, and a healthy offspring died shortly after birth, whether from tainted constitution or natural causes cannot be determined. Condition of community about respective residences.-The leper from the Sub- Division of Soopul, in the Tirhoot District, knows of three others in his village; and two of the Purneah men know of one other besides themselves. Intercourse.-Unrestrained between the married and no positive separation from their different sections. Syphilis.-Three had primary ulcers only, one had secondary eruptions, and one man had two attacks of each anterior to the present disease, i. e., half the number out of ten. Mercury.-Salivation was undergone in one case. Medicaments.-Both Native and European medicines were taken in one case, and wild herbs in a few. Among the Native remedies valued are strychnia, bleeding, purgatives, the flower of a vegetable called ole, which has tubercular protuberances like leprosy.
(21) Drinking water.-From wells, except one who used river water. Bathing.-Ditto ditto. Privations.-Nothing severe for condition of life. Diet.-Totaey Dossad acknowledges to have been a great pork-eater; Lukhoo Danghur is a pork-eater also; Mowlabuksh, a native of Tirhoot, of murwah bread; Budhia female, of Purneah, of fish, jungly sags or greens, and the vegetables known as ole and cutchoo; Ruggoonath, of stale rice, and many of new rice, which is always cheaper. None can say whether the cereals or pulses on which they lived were in any diseased or unfit for human consumption, but there is no doubt that food of this nature and decomposing fish is largely consumed by the lower classes of people, and that their diet is generally indiscriminate. Abstinence.-Lepers abstain from eating the red pumpkin, which they consider unwholesome and stimulating diet, which they say produces great heat of skin and feverishness. Contagion-Is clear in the case of the female Bilasee, who contracted the dis- ease from her husband; and in the case of Mowlabuksh, who was in the habit of coming always in contact with his brother; and of Secom Gowla, whose father was a leper. Assigned causes.-Cultivation and purchase of a plot of ground belonging to a leper, cohabitation with a diseased husband, hereditary transmission and conta- gion, and will of Providence. In addition to the above summary, it may be stated that, if malaria was among the causes of leprosy, this district would furnish a large amount of cases, which it does not, and the disease is not endemic in it either. Of the six Purneah cases, in one village only are there two lepers; in all the rest single cases. PURNEAH; L. PICACHY, The 13th March 1877. Civil Medical Officer. No. 1. Name.-JAGARNATH KETHRIE.

GHOSE, M. D., M. R. C. S., Civil Surgeon of Rungpur. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Presidency Circle. WITH reference to your circular  memorandum No. 11 of the 22nd April 1875, giving cover to departmental circular No. 12, dated the 17th April 1875, I have the honour to submit the following report on leprosy in this   district.    Before entering into the subject I ought  to make an apology and explain the cause of delay in the submission of this report.    A thorough enquiry into the subject with a. view to the ascertaining of the detailed circumstances under which  the disease exists  requires travelling over a large tract of country far from  head quarters  and requiring  pro- tracted absence  from the station.    I have therefore taken the opportunities  of my visits to the dispensaries in the interior of the district, from where I made excursions to the villages in which leprosy prevailed,  and took careful notes  of the history of the cases, and  made  personal   observation of the  circumstances  under which  the affected  people   live.    I  had  heavy responsibilities in the  shape of an unhealthy jail, and could not therefore  protract my stay in the interior sufficiently long to
(   27   ) enable me to complete the enquiry within the allotted time. Taking all these circum- stances into consideration, and specially the condition of my jail which required my devoted attention, I trust Government will be pleased to absolve me from any charge of apathy on the subject that I would otherwise be liable to. I have travelled over most of the places in which the disease prevails, and visited several villages and examined 378 cases. By this means I have formed a pretty accurate idea of the circumstances under which leprosy exists in this district. I will now take up the subject under three heads as prescribed in paragraph 8 of the Resolution of the Government of India dated the 5th March 1875: I. The extent to which leprosy exists among the people in the district.-The prevalence of the disease in Rungpur was incidentally noticed by Dr. Liveing in his Goulstonian lectures for 1873.* The census returns of 1872 show the number of lepers in this district to be 2,120 males and 182 females. Now in the enumera- tion reports none but the confirmed lepers could have found their way, and this I found to be actually the case. Making the original census papers of the villages, now lying in the Collectorate of the district, as my guide, in search of the afflicted localities, I found that for every confirmed leper entered against them three in the earlier stages of the disease on an average were left out. Then again a large number of women afflicted with the disease eluded the notice of the census enu- merators; I could not accurately ascertain the proportion of women thus left out, as I am certain the cases of young married women were not shown me by the people. If I take the female lepers to be 1 to 2 of male ones, I cannot over-estimate their number, for out of the 378 lepers I have taken notes of 125 were women. I assume, then, from the census figures that on the day of enumeration of the popula- tion of the district there were 2,120 male and 1,060 female lepers, or a total of 3,180 lepers in the advanced stage of the disease. Now if we add to that three times as many persons who were in the earlier stages of the malady, and did not declare themselves lepers before census enumerators, we have a total number of 12,720 individuals who were afflicted with leprosy in January 1872, or about 6 per 1,000 of population. If we now see how this number is distributed over the district we shall come to the next head of our enquiry, viz.- * See page 31. II.    Is the disease localized ?-Following the census papers I have worked  up the proportion of lepers in each thannah as shown in   the  accompanying  statement,*  and classified them  into  four  tracts  having   different degrees  of  prevalence in  the following manner: First, the tract of extreme prevalence, consisting of two thannahs-Phoorun- baree and Barobaree-lying between the Rivers Dhurla and Teesta, and having lepers to the proportion of 112 per 1,000 of population. The second tract in which the prevalence of the disease is above the average of the district, viz., 73, is a large portion of country almost surrounding the tract of extreme prevalence, and extending South and East towards the whole border of the River Brahmaputra as far as it lies in this district. This tract comprizes the five thannahs of Dimla, Sadoollapur, Ulipur, Chilmaree and Bhowanegunge, the three last-named thannahs bordering that large river and lying at the site of union of the Rivers Teesta and Dhurla with the Brahmaputra. The third tract having a prevalence below the average of the district, viz., 48, and is composed of the thannahs of Durwanee, Jaldhaka, Nisbettgunge, Maheegunge on the South and East, and the isolated thannahs of Nageshuree on the North-East and Gobindgunge on the South. The two last-named thannahs almost partake of the character of the second tract. The four first-named thannahs again form that bit of country lying between the purely alluvial soil forming the first and second tracts and the hard laterite country on the West and South. Fourth, the tract of extreme freedom from the disease has a proportion of only 208 per 1,000, and is chiefly composed of the hard laterite portions of the district. It will thus appear that the disease is distributed over the whole district, and that certain portions of it in point of its prevalence present a remarkable con- trast to others. These tracts of extreme prevalence and comparative immunity present a marked difference in their physical features and in the character of the people inhabiting them, as also in the circumstances under which they live. And in order * Elephantiasis Grcorum or true Leprosy, by Robert Liveing, page 127.
( 28 ) to be precise and brief, I will place them in a tabular form in the following manner : Points of difference. Tract of extreme prevalence. Tract of comparative immunity.

During my travels of enquiry I found the disease more common towards the rivers than in villages far removed from them ; but when the immediate banks are high, it is almost altogether absent from them. A marked contrast of this kind I observed in one part of the River Teesta. Either bank here is inhabited by Hindus of the fishing castes, but being of different sub-castes they do not intermarry or mix in other way. They follow the same occupation and live otherwise under similar circumstances. Among these fishermen on the left bank I could not find a single case, whereas among those on the right bank numbering about 80 individuals there were six lepers. In the laterite tract the majority of the lepers that I found were inhabitants of the alluvial portions of the tract. The villages where I found the disease most prevalent are either on the banks of a river or surrounded by marshes and old river beds. Dry and high spots, whether near a river or not, enjoy a marked immunity from the disease.
( 29 ) Other skin diseases, such as itch, ringworm and psoriasis of a chronic character, are very common in villages where lepers are found. The food supply in these villages is defective. There is little or no variety in it. They are badly supplied with markets, and the people, as a rule, live on the rice they cultivate, and consume a large quantity of imperfectly dried fish as well as the small fish found in bheels which are unfit for purposes of export. Their houses are low mat huts surrounded by dense jungle and clumps of bamboos. These latter overhanging the yards exclude the sun from them. In the occupation of fishing these people often immerse themselves in muddy water and smear themselves with mud for hours and pass sometimes a whole day in wet clothes. This constant contact of water with the skin, I fancy, has much influence in the production of the disease. It undoubtedly is a potent cause of the other skin diseases I found prevalent in these villages. In fact, the atmosphere charged with vapour ; their occupation requiring constant immersion in water ; their damp, ill-ventilated habitations, and the want of clothing, all tend to interfere with the healthy functions of the skin. The people in these villages seemed to be extremely fond of their homes, and never emigrate. The population of a whole village I sometimes found related to each other, and married and intermarried among themselves, and lived and died in it. I found a number of old people who told me that they never spent a night away from home. The low caste Hindus I found suffered more specially than the Muhammadans or Aryan Hindus, and among the Hindus jalias (fishermen) and Rajbungshis (a Hinduized aboriginal tribe given exclusively to agricultural pursuits) suffer a great deal more than men of other castes. III.-I now analyse the 378 cases I took notes of, and give their circum- stances in the following concise manner : (1.) Sex.-Out of the 378 cases examined 253 were males and 125 females. (2.) Race.-Two hundred and eighty-six were Hindus and 92 Mussulmans. In point of caste of Hindus they were- Rajbungshis (a race of Hinduized aborigines) 125 Jalias (fishing castes) 81 Other castes 80 Total 286 (3.) Occupation-  Agriculturists 198 Fishermen 56 Boatmen 15 Beggars 78 Artizans 4 Writers 2 Priest 1 Trader 1 Prostitutes 2 General servants 3 Indefinite occupation and women depending entirely  on others 18 Total 378 (4.) Heredity.-Only in 11 cases could I trace evidence of hereditary taint, but I have no doubt that there were others among them who either concealed the truth, or were not aware of the fact of their parents or ancestors having suffered from the disease. In one instance I found two brother were diseased about the same time; but they could not inform me if any of their ancestors suffered from it. (5.) Evidence of origin from contagion.-One cannot look into the circum- stances of the origin if the disease in several of cases without believing in contagion. That personal contact alone will not cause the disease is evident; but it may be said to be contagious in the same sense as typhoid fever or cholera is contagious, though not to the same degree. There is strong presumption that the H
(   30   ) malady is due to a contagium or communicable germ, which takes root and flourishes under favourable circumstances, and these favourable circumstances are climate, soil and other hygienic conditions. These conditions alone cannot produce the disease; as under similar circumstances the disease does not originate. Again, where the hygienic conditions are good, the disease, if introduced, will not spread as it does not in some parts of the district, although so close to others infested with it. Numbers of cases came to my notice in which the leprous individual re- members having lived in close proximity to some one else affected or had distant relationship with other lepers, but there were 33 cases in which the persons lived in the same house with other lepers before getting it. In four of these 33 cases there was sexual intercourse with leprous individuals before the attack. In one village I found six individuals in different stages of the disease, more or less related to each other. A woman got leprosy first from a leprous husband who lived in another village. Her parents were not leprous. After her husband's death she came to live with her brother, and before she was a year in the house he got the disease. In the course of six years three other individuals in the neighbouring houses were affected. The oldest individual in this village assured me that before the woman returned home after her husband's death he had not seen a leper in that village. I beg to annex a skeleton map of the district showing the sites of prevalence, the deepest colour indicating the parts of country most infested and then shading off to places of comparative immunity, the places almost free from the disease having been left altogether blank.

REM?R?S . 1 Thakurgaon. 45 Leprosy   is   scattered   throughout   the whole district. The   climate is bad, and there is only one mineral prrduct in it, viz., lime, which lies  in   the  form   of kunkur in   scattered   beds   in   several   localities   at various depths.    The Southern portion of the district is undulating : no  mountains nor hills ; a great deal of forest and   barren   land.    The   disease   does   not appear at all hereditary, most   of those  that I examined did not get the disease till long after puberty, and they said that they contracted  it either from the wife or husband. As far as I could judge, most seemed to have got it through poverty, exposure, bad food and worse clothing - in fact, dirty habits. There are a good many   well   off  and   even   in   independent  circumstances suffering from the disease.    Drinking water does not seem to have anything whatever to do  with it.    Scarcely  anything has been done in the way of carrying out general treatment.    Those coming under my own care have had the chalmoogra oil treatment with very little benefit I am sorry to record. 2 Ranigunge 22  3 Ranisunkail 64  4 Patiram 6  5 Beergunge 85  6 Garneah Out-post 32  7 Putnitola 11  8 Bungshihari 31  9 Habrah 80  10 Mohadebpur 4  11 Chintamon 24  12 Kotwali 8  13 Hemtabad 60  14 Rajarampur 46  15 Gangarampur 26  16 Atwari 131  17 Parsha 23  18 Nawabgunge 30  19 Kaliagunge 60  20 Peergunge 16   Total 804                 DINAGEPUR ;                                                J.

WITH reference to your memorandum No. 111 of the 5th January last, I have the honour to report that I have not seen a case of true tuberculated leprosy, nor I have been able to get any information. It does not appear to exist in the district to any great degree. I believe there are a few isolated cases to be met with here and there. I may say I have seen a case of what is called white leprosy, a few cases of those are in the district.
(   33    ) No. 77, dated Motihari, the 17th March 1877. From-The Civil Surgeon, Chumparun. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Dinapore Circle. WITH reference to your memorandum No. 123 of 28th December last, forward- ing Surgeon General's circular No. 134 and No. 3797 of Under Secretary to Gov- ernment of Bengal, I have the honour to submit the following remarks: (1)     On   receipt   of   the   above    instructions   I   endeavoured   to   ascertain through the police in each thannah the actual number of lepers now existing in this district, and at the same time to obtain various information as to their social habits, age, caste, duration of disease, influence of locality, if any, &c., &c.; but I regret to say that up to present no  information  has  been  received,   and   I  find  that   my application was altogether mislaid.    I have recently again applied for   the  informa- tion, and on its  receipt will forward  a  supplementary  report  on   the  subject to your Office. (2)     During the past month  I  have travelled over a considerable portion of my district, and  in   addition   have   called   for   reports   from   the   Assistant Surgeons and Hospital Assistants  at the outlying dispensaries  on the subject.    I have only seen about ten cases of leprosy in all, and my subordinates are unanimous in their statements that very few  cases exist in their several divisions of the district. I made special enquiry also among the planters with a like negative result in  every instance. In Motihari Municipality, for instance, with a population of 8,266 only eight lepers were found on taking a rough census the other day; and when it is taken into consideration that three of these were beggars attracted to sadr station from different quarters, the percentage is very low. In point of fact, even taking the proportion of lepers to population from census return of 1872, viz., 305 lepers out of 1,440,815, or 21 per 1,000, the disease cannot be said to be exceptionally severe in Chumparun; and from my own observation, and the opinions of my subordinates and the planters, many of whom have been resident here for years, I cannot believe there are as many as reported. (3)     Certainly there  are  no  leper   villages  in  the  district,   or   any  special condition that I am aware  of, peculiar to  the isolated cases that  have come under my notice. (4)    Tubercular leprosy  among the  known cases is of very rare  occurrence. I have only seen three  or  four  cases during  my  residence here.    Two varieties of the non-tuberculated  form  are  more  common,   viz., the ansthetic and the leuco- pathic;  none are  in any  way   contagious,   and there  is  generally an hereditary history.    This morning  while seeing out-patients  a chaprassie, just imported from Mozufferpur, presented himself for treatment with a well marked circular discoloured ansthetic patch on forearm just above wrist; he stated that it came on with numb- ness, tingling and burning  sensation  in   the  part  about   three months since,  and now the centre has completely lost sensation.    In his   case there  is   no   hereditary history; he is a pale hearty man about 55, and otherwise in sound health.    All   the cases I have seen   or heard of   are  middle-aged;   they  are  of various castes and classes, but mostly beggars. In conclusion, I beg to submit that as I only took charge of this district in February 1876, I was unaware that a report on leprosy had been previously called for by the Surgeon General, the circular was not placed before me on looking over the office arrears, and consequently its non-submission on my part was unavoidable.

No. 93, dated Baksar, the 3rd March 1877. From-N. JACKSON, Esq., M. D., Medical Officer, Baksar. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Dinapore Circle. WITH reference to your circular No. 19, datad the 27th of February, received this morning, I beg to report that I have made every endeavour in my power to obtain information concerning leprosy. I
?(   34   ) 2.    The police have been addressed independently.   The Joint Magistrate  has been addressed both viv voce and by letter, and the result has been  that  five  cases of leprosy have been brought to me by the police and three have been discovered by myself in the town and purlieus of Baksar. 3.    I had to  give karaki to  the latter, as they became demonstrative and threatened to do dharna, if not paid something. 4.    I have before explained to you that I have no authority   to  travel  outside of Baksar Town, as that would be to invade the jurisdiction  of the  Civil  Surgeon of Shahabad. 5.    I  have  taken report of the eight cases  collected  under the circumstances detailed above, and will submit them if you order me to  do  so,  but they  are of no interest, and have probably been already reported  on by  the Civil Surgeon of Shahabad. 6.    Circular No.  12 of the 17th April of 1875 can nowhere be found in this Office, either among the written circulars or among those issued in a printed form; nor is it in the quarterly sheet for the year. 7.    If you still wish me to report and give the particulars   of the  few  cases I have been able to  collect, I  beg   you  to  send me  the   missing circular  above referred to. No. 356, dated Backergunge, the 13th July 1877. From-W. F. MURRAY, Esq., Civil Surgeon of Backergunge. To -The Deputy Surgeon General, Dacca Circle. IN answer to circular memorandum No. 15, dated 11th June 1877, I have the honour to state that a considerable number of cases of leprosy exist in this district. Leprosy is chiefly found in the vicinity of the following villages: Bagody, Sorikal, Matahar, Amanatgunge, Moolady, Burrisal and Rooparjur. It is not, however, confined to these places, but scattered throughout the district. Lepers live apart from their families. They do not take food with the other members, neither do they cohabit with their wives. Persons who have leucoderma are not, as a rule, subjected to these restrictions, but those afflicted with tuberculous and ulcerating leprosy suffer most in these respects. In some cases the disease is undoubtedly hereditary, in other cases the causes cannot be ascertained. It is believed by the Natives to be contagious, but from my experience this belief is not borne out by facts. When taken in the early stages, the progress of the disease is greatly influenced by the application of gurjun oint- ment, which certainly is most beneficial, and in many cases effects a complete cure. It is looked on by the Native kobirajes as a specific. No. 289, dated Jessore, the 19th March 1877. From-R. T. WRIGHT, Esq., M. D., Civil Surgeon, Jessore. To-The Deputy   Surgeon   General,  Indian Medical Department,  Presi- dency Circle. I HAVE the honour to state that in reply to my inquiries the District Superin- tendent of Police reports 619 lepers to be found in the Jessore District. 2. The sex is not distinguished, but it appears that only 54 inherited leprosy, while 565 had no idea of its cause. 3.    They  believe the disease  incurable,  so it is difficult to persuade them  to submit  to  treatment,  and 20 who  were  treated   with  gurjun   oil,  received  no benefit. 4.    I have been here  so short  a time that I cannot speak of this district from my own personal knowledge, and I  therefore append the opinion of my predecessor Dr. Gregg.    His letter No. 763 of 30th June 1875, and the police return for 1876, also annexed, shew the disease to be generally diffused in the district.
(   35   ) No. 763, dated Jessore, the 30th June 1875. From-W. H. GREGG, Esq., M. B., Civil Surgeon, Jessore. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Presidency Circle. IN answer to your circular memorandum No. 11 of the 5th March last, I have the honour to report that I have taken great trouble in order to collect the information required. Leprosy is not confined to any particular part of Jessore. It is most common in the Sub-Divisions of Jhenida, Magoora, Narail and Bagirhat, which form the North and East of the district, and through which the Rivers Modhumuti, Koomar, Nobogungee run. The Sadr Sub-Division and Khoolna which form the central, West and South portion of the district, are more free from the disease. This will be clearly seen from the accompanying statement. In March the largest number of cases there; no evidence of hereditary taint. The number of lepers which attend the dispensary is very small. They believe that the disease is incurable. I have treated the lepers with gurjun oil, but with only partial success.                                         ______________ Statement showing the number of lepers in the District of Jessore for year 1876.

To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Dacca Circle, Shillong. IN reply to your circular memorandum No. 15 of the 11th June 1877, calling for a report on leprosy in the district, I have the honour to inform you that the disease appears to be very rare in the Noakholly District, two cases only having been met with during the past eighteen months. From the entries in the prescription and attendance book of the charitable dispensary, as well as from information gathered from the Native Doctor in charge, it is ascertained that Johar Ali, aged 40 years, and inhabitant of Sundeep, applied for treatment on the 15th September, and taking a supply of gurjun oil returned home the same day. He stated that he had been suffering from the disease for three years, but could not give particulars of his health immediately preceding its first appearance, but that there was no history of leprosy in his family. The second case, that of a man from Begumgunge, named Sarafut Ali, aged 25 years, came to the charitable dispensary on the 12th October last. He stated he had always enjoyed good health up to his eighteenth year, when he contracted syphilis, and that during the following twelve months he was in the hands of the Native physicians, who treated him largely with calomel, and that while suffering from the effects of mercurialization he first noticed and complained of numbness
(   36   ) of the feet and hands which, ultimately ulcerating, led to the sloughing off of several of his fingers and toes. In his family also there was no history of here- ditary taint. Both these cases were of the non-tuberculated form, and they attended hospital for one day only. I regret that I am not able to furnish you with more detailed information re- garding these cases ; but keeping in view the points specified in the above circular, I have directed the Native Doctor to detain all cases of leprosy in future until my morning visit to the hospital, or, if that is inconvenient to the patient, to send for me. In conclusion, I beg to state that circular memorandum No. 84 of the 15th January 1877 does not appear to have reached this Office. ____________ No. 400, dated Mymensingh, the 30th June 1877. From-E. BOVILL, Esq., M. B., F. R. C. S., Civil Surgon, Mymensingh. To -The Deputy Surgeon General, Dacca Circle, Shillong. WITH reference to your circular No. 15, dated Shillong, the 11th June 1877, I have the honour to report that leprosy appears to prevail in a slight degree in most parts of the district. As I have only been here a few months, I am unable to speak with any certainty on this point. I have made enquiries from Native Doctors and persons long resident in the district, and none of them have been able to point out particular seats of the disease. With a view to obtaining fuller information on this point, I have sent a circular to all the branch dispensaries on the subject, and will, on receipt of answers, furnish you with any information they may convey. As a matter of experience it is not uncommon to meet with lepers, but I have no information of their real or comparative numbers. In the charitable dispensary the following numbers were treated :     Out-patients. In-patients. 1874 ...     5 0 1875 ...     5 0 1876 ...     11 6  21 6 None of these are reported as cured. There is at present one leper in the jail amongst 375 prisoners ; he is undergoing a sentence of ten years. He is a Garo from Shushung at the foot of the Garo Hills. He says that his father suffered from leprosy, but none of the rest of his family except himself. He was a leper on admission to the jail eight years since. He says that leprosy exists, but it is not very common amongst the Garos. On looking through 3,126 admissions to the jail, I find four cases of leprosy recorded. They all occurred amongst Muhammadans. Two cases were from the sadr station, one form Jamalpur, 36 miles to the North-West, and one from Kendun, 32 miles to the East of Nasirabad. The register shews 121 cases per mille. The following has been received from the Magistrate's Office in answer to an enquiry as to the location and prevalence of leprosy : " I regret that I am unable to give you full information on the subject of leprosy. In this district it is neither epidemic nor endemic, but sporadic cases are not uncommon though at the same time not frequent. We have, however, no statistics on the subject. The disease is not localised, and I have not studied it sufficiently to offer an opinion on the special conditions under which it is usually found to occur."
?( 37 ) Report on Leprosy in the Dacca District. THE total number of lepers in the Dacca District, as shewn in the returns of the census of 1872, amounted to 852, of whom 723 were males and 129 females. The total population of the district was 906,238 males and 947,659 females, giving an average of 7 977 male lepers in every 10,000 males and 1361 female lepers in every 10,000 females and 4598 lepers in every 10,000 of the population. The average for the Presidency of Bengal was 52 lepers in 10,000, so that Dacca occupies a position somewhat below the average. It was unlikely therefore at first sight that the Dacca District would offer any striking illustration of the causes of leprosy taken as a whole. 2 On enquiring into the distribution of the disease, however, I found that the different thannahs into which it is divided varied in the number of reported lepers from 0208 in Harirampur to 7248 in Kapasia in 10,000; and the following table has been drawn up to illustrate this point. Here the Sadr Station and Lalbagh are taken together, as the figures furnished to me, do not enable me to distinguish them. I. Table showing the distribution of lepers in the Dacca District.

Kapasia which is thus shown to be the most leprous thannah is situated at the extreme North of the district, and is the highest and hilliest part of it. It has a red laterite soil, with great fluctuations in the level of the subsoil water, and is eminently malarious. It is covered with a s?l jungle. The people get their water from wells without any protecting parapet to keep out surface flushings. The District Superintendent of Police, who is well acquainted with both districts, assures me that in these respects, as well as in the coarse food of the people, this part of the district resembles very closely the country round Bancoorah (where the number of lepers is 41 in 10,000). In both there is a hilly sl jungle, and the people indulge freely in "kachu" (a kind of caladium) and other jungle roots. He asserts that he can distinguish an inhabitant of either of these districts by the configuration of the body which their habits lead to. Hearty meals of rice with jack and "kachu" give rise to a dyspepsia with protuberance of the upper part of K
?( 38 ) the abdomen, which he says is characteristic. There is also much enlargement of the spleen. The red laterite is spread also over the greater part of Raipura, and the Northern parts of Lalbagh, Sabhar and Rupgunge, where they are contiguous to Kapasia, the rest of the district being alluvial generally with a large admixture of fine white sands. These where the laterite is found are also the highest parts of the country, which in point of elevation may be classed as follows : High- Kapasia, Raipura, part of Sabhar and Lalbagh and the Town of Dhaka; Low- Manikgunge, Srinagar, Nawabgunge, Munshigunge and parts of Sabhar and Lalbagh. The other places are intermediate in elevation. Next to Kapasia, Jafurgunge shows the largest number of lepers. Though of medium height, it is considerably water-logged, i. e., most of the land dries by evaporation, and not by natural drainage, and it ranks very high in point of malariousness; Lalbagh and Jafurgunge standing second on the list. Manikgunge alone heading them in that respect. It cannot be said, however, that the amount of leprosy in a district or thannah bears a direct relation to its malariousness. A comparison of the thannahs in point of malariousness, as judged of by the number of reported deaths from fever per 10,000 of the population, will show that they arrange themselves in a totally different order than when they are arranged in order of their relative number of leprous inhabitants as in the following table : II. Order of thannahs in respect of leprosy. Order of thannahs in respect of malaria. Name. Elevation, soil, drainage, &c. Number per 10,000 of population. Name. Number of deaths from fever per 10,000 of population.* Harirampur  Medium elevation, alluvial 0208 Manikgunge 856 Munshigunge  Ditto ditto 2828 Dacca and Lalbagh 77 Naraingunge Ditto ditto 3746 Jafurgunge 767 Sabhar  Partly high, laterite     Partly low, alluvial 4215 Rupgunge 747 Raipura High laterite 4448 Naraingunge 709 Rupgunge Low, alluvial and covered with 4468 Harirampur  59 7  thick jungle.

Srinagar Low, alluvial, water-logged 5827 Nawabgunge 426 Jafurgunge Medium elevation, alluvial 6120 Raipura 372 Kapasia High laterite, great fluctuations  7248 Srinagar 355  of sub-soil water.    * Average of five years. With regard to water-logging of the soil, I have no trustworthy information regarding the sub-soil water in any of the thannahs, but Srinagar, Nawabgunge, Jafurgunge and Manikgunge are very imperfectly drained, the water over large tracts of country having no natural outlet on the falling of the rivers, and in many parts of them large bhils remain through the whole dry season. Whether this water-logging has anything to do with the causation of leprosy or not, it will be noted that these thannahs all occur in the latter half of Table No. I., their position in it being 7, 8, 10 and 11, that is, they constitute four of the six thannahs in which the reported number of lepers is largest. The Collector of Dacca (from whom I have derived the greater part of the information) states that in Harirampur, in which there seems to be the smallest number of lepers, the physi- cal condition of the people is identical with that of the neighbouring thannahs of Nawabgunge and Srinagar, but it is somewhat better drained. Kapasia, on the other hand, is a high hilly country, water in the dry weather being only got from deep wells. This militates against any theory that leprosy can be induced to any great extent by habitual water-logging of the soil.
?(   39   ) The people of the Dacca District are as a rule well-to-do, and have as much to eat as they wish. The cultivation of jute has raised them in this respect above many of their fellows in other districts. Fish is abundant all over the district, but especially in the low-lying parts of it. There is probably less fish in Kapasia in the dry season than in the other thannahs, but it is everywhere and almost daily article of diet. They do not eat stale or putrifying fish, though they eat kinds not generally eaten by Europeans on account of their bones. Dl is freely eaten; all kinds except arhar and bhoot are found in every bazaar. Potatoes are used largely in the town of Dacca,  and are grown  extensively  in Keranigunge (Lalbagh), but have not yet come into use in the district generally. The usual Native tarkaries are eaten throughout the district. In Kapasia, as already mentioned, the people seem to devour also various jungle roots; but with this exception the food of the people of this district is not different from that of any other part of Bengal Proper. Conclusions.-It may perhaps be perceived that my report is arranged in different heads: 1.    Prevalence.-7977 males and 1361   females, or 4595 in every 10,000   of the population are affected with leprosy in this district.    The disproportion between males and females is probably due to a certain extent to   non-registration of female sufferers,  but it is  believed  to be to   a considerable degree natural.    It  varies in different thannahs from 0208 in Harirampur to 7248 in Kapasia. 2.    Topography.-It is most prevalent in the high laterite parts of the district and in the low water-logged thannahs where there is  little or   no natural drainage, where the soil dries by evaporation; and those districts return the smallest number of lepers, which are alluvial and of medium elevation, with a comparatively free natural drainage. 3.    Relation to malaria.-A certain rough relationship seems to exist between the two forms  of disease  (see Table II).    But there are as many exceptions to  the rule as thannahs following it.    Thus the low water-logged Srinagar, which is third in the list for leprosy, strangely enough has had fewest deaths from malarial diseases during the first five years; while Kapasia, the most leprous thannah, has,  notwith- standing  the  opinion of the District Superintendent of Police and his department, a comparatively low death-rate from fevers. 4.    The general physique of the people is for Bengalis fairly good. 5.    As to their food, I do not  think  that any legitimate  conclusion   can  be drawn from the facts before me on this point.    It is sufficiently good and varied. 6.    I do not place any reliance on the figures supplied   by   the  census   returns as  regards  the  actual  number  of lepers   in  the   district.    The people habitually confound leucoderma with leprosy on the one  hand,  and  many   cases   of constitu- tional  syphilis   are  considered  as  cases   of leprosy by the laity.    But these errors were probably equally made in all  the   districts,  and   do not  affect  materially a comparative return   like the present.    The actual number of lepers who registered themselves as such in the sadr station is only 19.    I am sure   I do not   exaggerate when  I say  that   I see  as many as 8 or 10 lepers every Sunday morning between my house and the Mitford Hospital,  and   I  am  inclined to believe that  there is more leprosy in this district than the census returns show. Finally, I regret that much of the information regarding the district which I have felt called upon to give in writing this report I have not derived from actual personal observation, as my short stay in Dacca has not yet given me an opportu- nity of visiting any but some of the nearer parts of the district. The Magistrate of Dacca, who knows the country very thoroughly, was good enough to answer a number of questions I sent to him regarding the topography and habits of the people of the district, and the District Superintendent of Police also gave me the interesting comparative information regarding Kapasia and Bancoorah.

(   40   ) No. 143, dated Comilla, the 7th July 1877. From-The Civil Surgeon of Tipperah. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Dacca Circle. IN reply to your circular memorandum No. 15, dated 11th June, calling for a report of leprosy, I have the honour to state that this disease does not exist to any extent in this district. During the seven years I have been here only two cases of leprosy came under my observation, which were noted in my Office No. 230, dated 23rd June 1876. I have also called upon the local Native Doctors for any information they may possess regarding this disease, but their reply has been that they have not met with any cases. Former medical reports also confirm my experience that leprosy is very " uncommon in this district". Dated Chittagong, the 14th July 1877. From-R. D. MURRAY, Esq., M. B., Civil Surgeon of Chittagong. To-Deputy Surgeon General, Dacca Circle. IN reply to your circular No. 15, dated the 11th June 1877, I have the honour to submit the following report: 1.    Leprosy is  not  common in  Chittagong,  not  more  than  a dozen  cases having  come  under  my  observation  during  the 15 months I have been resident here.    It is very  difficult  to   get  accurate  information   regarding  the extent  to which it prevails, and the  reports  I  have received from  the  Assistant   Surgeon, who like myself is new  to the place, and the Hospital Assistant at Cox's Bazaar, are extremely vague and meagre.    Since April 1st, 1876, 39 cases   of leprosy   have applied  for  treatment at  the Charitable Dispensary.    Gurjun oil, with equal parts of lime water  used  both  internally  and  externally,  was  the  treatment adopted in all of these  cases,  and  gave  "more  or  less  relief".    None  of   the  patients attended sufficiently long to  enable one to judge of the effects of treatment; for gurjun oil is decidedly a slow-acting medicine, and in cases where it does  good or effectually  cures  it  is  only after many  months'   assiduous   use.    In   the   Cox's Bazaar   Sub-Division leprosy  would  appear to  be  little known.    The   Hospital Assistant in charge, a most painstaking, reliable  and  zealous   officer,  has  scarcely seen a case during  his  whole period  of service there.    Two  doubtful cases that came under his  observation  were  apparently  brought  on " by venereal affection or bad mode of livelihood".    These were as likely to be cases of syphilis as leprosy. There is no further information from that portion of the district. 2.    The disease does not  appear to  be  specially localised.    It has been most observed  in  the town, and usually among badly-off ill-fed Up-country men rather than among the aborigines, fakirs and vagrants of various  sorts.    Next to  these come Muhammadan ryots, then low  class  Hindus, and, lastly,  Mughs,   among whom   the affection is very rare.    No age is specially exempt; it has been observed as  early  in  life  as   19,   and  as  late  as   60   years  of age.    Next to the station itself Rangoonea in the North of the district  would appear  to yield the largest number of cases; but that  is probably  owing to the people of that locality having greater facilities of communication with the town,  for  they  can  come  down  the River   Kurnafoolia by  one   tide, and after   visiting the  hospital can  return  by the  next.    There  is  no  more  positive  or satisfactory information on this subject of the localisation of the disease. 3.    Individual cases- (1.) Cases treated at the dispensary since 1st April last: (a.)-Hindu Up-country man, aged about 40, and cloth-dealer by trade. In him the disease, which is of the tubercular variety, has advanced to the ulcerating stage, the feet being most affected. His disease is not traceable to any hereditary or constitutional taint, and came on prior to his leaving his Native country.
?(   41   ) (b)-Muhammadan lascar, aged 36, inhabitant of Katakhali (about 20 miles South of the town). His disease (tubercular) began twelve years ago, and is not traceable to any hereditary or venereal taint. He states, however, that his wife and children have contracted the disease only recently, and that there are some more cases of leprosy in his village. (c)-Muhammadan ryot of this town, aged about 35; his disease is of the ansthetic variety, and confined to the right hand. There is no history of any hereditary or constitutional taint. (2.) Two cases that came under my own personal notice as prisoners in the jail during last year, and an account of which I gave in my last anuual medical report of the jail. (a)-This was a case of lepra ansthetic in a Hindu labourer. The disease was characterised by annular patches of scaly eruption like lepra on psoriasis, and devoid of sensation in the centre of each ring. There was also to some extent in places a thickening and infiltration of the skin. (b)-A Muhammadan, aged 23, in whom the tubercular form was well exhibited; he was a stout, powerfully built man with good general health. The other man (a) was a badly nourished cachectic looking individual, and suffered frequently from diarrha and dysentery. In both cases the gurjun oil treatment was perseveringly followed. In the case of (a) little or no benefit accrued, while in (b) a marked improvement occurred. The larger tubercles diminished much in size, and incipient tubercles not only were checked in their development, but altogether disappeared. His general health likewise recovered itself sufficiently to enable him to work at hard labour. I employed him in jute- spinning for six weeks before his discharge from the jail without detriment.

WITH reference to circular No. 15, dated 11th June 1877, I have the honour to report for your information that not a single case of leprosy has come under my treatment in this district. I am therefore unable to furnish any report whatever on the subject. No. 46, dated the 7th March 1877. From-The Civil Surgeon of Balasore. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Presidency Circle. I HAVE the honour to submit the following report on leprosy called for in your circular memorandum No. 111 of 5th January 1877. One to 5,000 is supposed to be the proportion of lepers in this district. The ansthetic form of leprosy is chiefly met with. The disease is much more prevalent amongst men than women. I have not seen any children the subject of the disease, but believe it makes its appearance at any time in life. By far the larger proportion that came under observation, of which I have a total of over 70 cases, I find the ages to be between 25 and 45. My enquiries lead me to the belief that the disease is undoubtedly hereditary. The diseases appear more prevalent amongst the inhabitants of the sea-coast. In this district, Kooleegawn-a village about fifteen miles to the South-East of the sadr station and about four miles from the sea-is reported to have a large number of lepers. I visited the place and found eight houses affected in a total of about 300 houses. My enquiries lead me to doubt that the disease is communicable. I could not arrive at any single instance when the disease was even supposed to be communicated. The belief that fishermen are mostly affected in this village is erroneous, for of the eight houses only one belonged to the Gokha caste, others were all of distinct castes. L
(   42   ) No. 84, dated Pooree, the 11th March 1877. From-G. PRICE, Esq., Offg. Civil Surgeon of Pooree. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Presidency Circle. WITH reference to your circular memorandum No. 111 of the 5th of January 1877, calling for a report on the prevalence, &c., of leprosy in the district, I have the honour to state that, as I took medical charge of the civil station of Pooree on the 24th of February 1877, I have had no time for personal observation as to the prevalence, character, &c., of leprosy in this district. The following information on the subject is all I have been able to obtain from the returns of the three dispensaries in the district, and from reports furnished on application by the Native Doctors in charge of them. During the year 1876 the number of cases of leprosy which came for treat- ment to the three dispensaries was 95, and of these 50 (six in-door and 44 out-door patients) were treated at the Pipley Dispensary, situated half-way between Pooree and Cuttack, 32 (two in-door and 30 out-door patients) at the Khurdah Dispensary, situated to the extreme West of the district, and thirteen (two in-door and eleven out- door patients) at the sadr dispensary. It is thus seen that the disease is not localised in any one part of the district. Occupation of those affected.-From the records it appears that the cases occurred amongst people of almost every occupation, from clerks down to beggars, being rather more common amongst cultivators than any other class. Sex of those affected.-Of the total number of cases recorded (95), 80 were males and 15 females; but this, I am quite sure, does not represent accurately the proportion affected with the disease according to sex, as the number of males attending dispensaries is always greater than that of females, no matter what the disease may be. Hereditary taint.-Notes, stating whether or not the disease affected any other members of the families of the different patients, have been recorded in so few cases that any statistics given on that subject would be only misleading. Effects of treatment.-One or two cases are said to have been relieved by gurjun oil; but as a rule the patients did not persist in the treatment for a suffi- cient length of time to enable one to form any opinion as to the efficacy of the remedy. Of course, besides the 95 cases of leprosy treated, there are numbers of others in the district who never dream of going to a hospital for treatment; but still of the 95 cases the whole were not residents of the district,-about one-fifth consisting of pilgrims on their way to see Juggernath from all parts of India. Information of any value as to the different varieties of the disease has not been obtained. Of the thirteen cases which attended the sadr dispensary five are said to have been of the ansthetic variety, and eight of tuberculated variety with ulcers. No. 201, dated Cuttack, the 21st March 1877. From-Surgeon W. D. STEWART, Civil Surgeon of Cuttack. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Presidency Circle. WITH reference to your No. 111 of 5th January last, I have the honour to submit the following remarks on leprosy in this district. 2. The disease does not appear to prevail in Orissa to the same extent that it does in the Upper Provinces. It is confined chiefly to the poorer classes. When it is seen among the well-to-do, it is generally due to hereditary transmission; the evidence of transmission is generally very clear. In those cases where the disease originates de novo, and no history of heredity is obtainable, the causes are trace- able to error of nutrition arising from unwholesome food, such as stale or salted fish, diseased meat, or to living in particularly low or marshy localities as at Pooree and other places near the sea-coast. In such localities there is an increase also of elephantoid disease, which is a periodic fever attended with gradually increasing enlargement generally of the skin of leg and scrotum. Where this disease prevails, ansthetic leprosy is commonly seen with more or less of the tubercular variety, &c. By last census return there were 446 lepers in the District of Cuttack-382 were males and 64 females.
?(43) 3.    The medical subordinates of the mofussil dispensaries report as follows: Dhenkanal, Hill State on the West, only three cases, all males, inhabitants of the same locality, two of them live on opposite banks of a filthy pond. One of the three inherited the disease from his mother. A fourth case was in a man who came from Sumbulpur, whose grandmother suffered similarly. Jajepur, situated in the North of the district, very few cases seen. None admitted into hospital. Kendrapara, East of the district, about 30 miles from the sea. Disease more prevalent, 32 persons suffering in the town within a circumference of three miles. Most of them were attacked in the famine of 1866. 4.    In the town of Cuttack itself there are many cases, most of them among the poor, ill-clad and ill-fed; some of them  are very pitiable objects of distress.    On meeting such, the first thought that suggests itself is that they should be restrained from    moving   about    in    public    and  not  permitted  to  solicit  alms   as  they frequently do. 5.    When  trying the treatment  of gurjun oil, I collected a few cases in the neighbourhood of the branch dispensary for the purpose.    They attended regularly at first, but had not patience to continue.    Afterwards our supply of oil ran  short. The benefit in all was manifest.    The disease, however, cannot be cured by medicine alone, patients require sufficient and suitable food,  and  many  of them  are unable to afford this. 6.    I give a brief outline of eight cases which will shew the history and result of treatment.    In six there was hereditary  transmission.    Of the  two   remaining, one was a Muhammadan who used to work in leather, and one was a Rajput. There is a belief that syphilis occasionally develops the disease, and that the excessive use of mercury tends to the same effect; both would doubtless act in developing the disease if latent or predisposing  it  by causing  a  deteriorated  state  of the blood  and tissues. 7.    I also append a note from Babu Juggoo Mohun Roy,  Deputy   Magistrate of Cuttack,  who   has  been  in  Orissa  since   birth.    He is a Native gentleman of remarkably sound judgment.     His  long  experience  in  this  district  makes   his remarks all the more valuable. Brief history of eight cases of leprosy coming under observation in Cuttack. Heredity. I. BHOLLANATH MISSER, Brahmin, residing in Darga Bazaar, Cuttack; Mohurrir in the Judge's Office. Has had ansthetic and tubercular leprosy for past three years; father and mother alive, but have not the disease. On his mother's side the uncle's son, his sister and her daughter had the disease.    Patient has a  son aged eight, no symptoms of the complaint. His grandfather came from Punjab settled here. PRESENT STATE.-Disease commenced with ansthetic leprosy on right thigh as a thickened and whitened patch. It spread to legs, and the other thigh and forearm; about a year and half after tubercles appeared on legs; there are now several about the extremities, slightly over back; the ears are thickened and tubercled over convex margins, also margins of nose, lips and chin, slightly on cheeks and over eyebrows. Anthesia is well marked on arterior aspect of thighs. He cannot recognize number of points of pens touching skin at one inch apart. Appetite bad; bowels moved twice daily; sleep not very sound. Tubercles over knees are the largest size of a cherry, those on ankles are of a pea size; on right elbow they are little smaller than cherries, on wrist the size of peas. TREATMENT.-September 27.-To commence with two drachms of the gurjun oil emulsion twice a day and inunction once a day. October.-The oil acts on his bowels slightly; urine in the day high coloured; skin appears cleaner and softer. October.-Skin softer; tubercles on face not so prominent; says he feels his body lighter; appetite improved. November.-Continued  the oil for three months and was much benefited by it. II. APPEE, female, aged 30, Chamar caste, makes and sells cheroots; born in Cuttack. Has had ansthesia in left arm for three years, there is no power to recognize points in both forearms.

Toes are shortened and knobby, tubercled at ends, nails broken, thin and raised, slight exudation from them. Lobes of ears are thickened and tubercled, especially left.    Appetite impaired.    Bow- els regular.    Her father had  the  disease, and died of it when 40 years of age. She had only one child which died after birth ten years ago. There was one brother whe died years ago of some other complaint. There are four sisters. She is the eldest, the two next are at present free from the disease; the third one's daughter has the complaint; the fourth sister is also ill. TREATMENT.-September 27.- Commenced with oil. October 19.-The tubercles and raised patches on arm and face are less promi- nent, the itchy feeling she had is now stopped, so also the exudation from the toes and leg. November.-The oil continued to do good so long as it was taken, the scaly eruption on legs disappeared, the skin of legs became smooth, and swelling of face, nose and hands considerably diminished. Occupation. III.    RAHAMAN KHAN (September 28), aged 40,  formerly a maker  of leather vessels;   inhabitant   of    Cuttack.       No member of his family have had the disease; his sister is alive and has a daughter; these have no marks. Has eight children, the eldest 20 years, none of them is affected. Disease commenced ten years ago by tingling of the left hand, which afterwards got swollen and red; there was con- traction of flexor tendors, weakness of musles and inability to raise anything. The right hand began to be affected three years after the left, there was   ansthesia at the very commencement; fire falling on any part could not be felt. Ansthesia com- menced first in the left hand, and then in the right side of chest and right hand, then in right leg. None in left leg. There are patches of discolouration in small of back; on anterior and outer aspect of thighs with slight thickening; at present pinching over the part cannot be felt. The flexors of left arm firmly contracted, bending two phalanges over the first row; the palm of left hand is wasted and hollowed; the same condition, but in minor degree, exists in right hand; the two last fingers more so than others; the hollowing in palm is not so marked. There is bluish discolouration over right foot with shortening by 3/4th inch of great toe, thickening and glistening of ends of smaller toes. No tuburcles anywhere. Face clean and smooth; ear lobes, nose, &c., healthy. No treatment.

BHEEMA, aged 13, a young lad, looking  younger  than  thirteen; father and mother alive; occupation fisherman; parents have not got the disease according to his account; his  uncle has  it.    It   is well marked on  him.    There  are   several patches on face, trunk, buttocks and lower extremities (ansthesia). The insen- sibility is not much marked. There are no tubercles. The ears are smooth; small patches about face are reddish, distinctly raised and spreading. There is wasting of the upper and anterior half of right foot; underneath ball of big toes there is loss of the thick integument, fissures, and tendency to ulceration. The little toes are knobby, shortened, spreading out and becoming irregular. There is contrac- tion (flexing) of two last fingers of right hand; thickening and ulceration of middle finger (originating from burn). There are patches of scabious eruption with exudation on left hand; he can flex and extend its fingers easily; says he has had the disease three years. Has a brother twenty years, another eight years, and a sister three years,-all healthy. TREATMENT.-October.-Commenced. November.- Did not persevere with the oil. V.

Thickness of the lobes of ear much less. VI.    SHEIK THEEN  COWDEE, aged 18; Mussalman; works at late and  image painting; father and mother dead; can give   no  antecedent  history  of the disease. It commenced after the famine.    Nasal cartilages depressed at bridge  of nose; face and ears pretty smooth; no tubercles.    Trunk and extremities discoloured by  many small patches.    In the legs the skin is light bluish coloured  with  small   squamous patches; big toes are contracted and   stunted, both  phalanges  are  gone,  left  one reduced to half size.

There is a light patch on back, size of a shilling, not much  ansthesia there. TREATMENT.-October 19.-Commenced. Took the oil for one month; there were symptoms of improvement, but he had no patience to go on with the medicine, and considered it too troublesome to bathe every morning, and rub the oil in according to directions. Heredity in father traceable to children by differ- ent wives. VIII.    ROBERT SAHOO, aged 30; has had leprosy for the past 13   or   14  years.

The 24th March 1877.  MEMORANDUM. I HAVE been in Bengal and the up-country, and am of opinion that cases of leprosy are more numerous in Orissa than in Bengal, though not so numerous as in the up-country, which would seem to be particularly subject to this disease. In M
(   46    ) The Babu is a strict Hindu, hence these views. There can be no doubt, however, that the article called beef sold in bazaars is of very inferior quality. W. D. S. Orissa it is to be met with more among the Mussalmans than any other class of population. The use of beef by them is generally supposed to account for the difference. However untenable the theory may be upon other grounds, I think that this particular kind of meat being very much heating, as I believe it to be, is unsuited to the climate, and has combined with the unclean habits of the Mussalmans as a class to produce this result. In the generality of cases, especially among the Hindus, venereal diseases, and perhaps administration of mercury for their cure, have, I believe, been the cause of lepra. At least, in most of the instances that have come under my notice, the leprosy was clearly venereal. My view is further supported by the fact that the malady is to be met with more among people inhabiting and frequenting the towns than those living in the interior of the country, where the usual sources of the venereal diseases do not exist, at least to tht extent they do in the towns. That the malady, as a rule, descends from father to children does not, I think, admit of a doubt, for I have seen several instances in which it has done so. I also know of a case in which the husband has communicated the disease to the wife. CUTTACK; JUGGOO MOHUN ROY. The 17th March 1877.  D. N. M., R. D'R. & N. C. D.-Home, Rev. & Agri. Dept.

?No. 1674, dated Fort William, the 12th February 1878. From-J. F. BEATSON, Esq., M. D., Surgeon General, Indian Medical Dept. To-The Offg. Secretary to the Govt. of India, Home Department. * No. 598, dated 27th July 1876.  Herewith returned. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 71, dated 28th ultimo, and in reply to submit the following observations on the reports on leprosy in Bengal therewith forwarded for my remarks. In a previous letter* addressed to the Government of Bengal I commented on 12 reports on the same subject then sub- mitted. A few more reports have been received since those now under notice were forwarded. There is but one remaining to com- plete the provincial list, and on its receipt it will be submitted with any additional remarks which may appear necessary. Number of reports and districts to which they refer. 2. The reports now submitted are 31 in number-29 from medical officers in charge of districts, and two from medical officers in charge of sub-divisions. They may be arranged as follows : WESTERN BENGAL CENTRAL BENGAL NORTHERN BENGAL SOUTHERN BENGAL EASTERN BENGAL (mainly laterite). (mainly alluvial  (mainly alluvial). (deltaic). (mainly alluvial).  Gangetic).    Burdwan (L. and A). Moorshedabad. Darjeeling. Backergunge. Mymensing. Beerbhoom (L). Sonthal Pergun- Jalpaiguri. Jessore. Dacca. Hooghly (A). nahs. Purneah. Noakholly. Tipperah.

ORISSA (littoral). Balasore. Pooree. Cuttack. Value of the reports. 3. None of them are of much special value. In no case has the reporting officer made a prolonged special study of the subject. Many of them are extremely brief and devoid of information ; others are a mere comment on census figures, and hearsay evidence collected hastily from subordinates or civil officials. In a few instances per- sonal inquiries were made, but not of a character or extent to render much information of value. The truth is that questions connected with the causation of leprosy demand very careful research and discriminating analysis. Few medical officers are competent for the task, and no Civil Surgeon has the time necessary for it without neglecting the proper duties of his office. Such information as the reports do contain is summarily shown in what follows. The value of the census returns. 4. Some evidence is given affecting the value of the census returns (of 1872). These are said to be subject to the following fallacies : (A) A strong tendency to conceal leprosy more especially among women leading to understatement of the number of lepers generally and of female lepers especially. Only severe and advanced cases which can't be concealed are said to be returned.
?(   2   ) (?) Inability to distinguish leprosy from some other diseases- more especially leucoderma and some forms of syphilis-tending to overstatement of the number of lepers generally. These causes of inaccuracy are held by some reporters to balance each other ; but in order to do so, they would require to be equal as regards both force and distribution, which is probably not the case. On the other hand, the testimony contained in these reports broadly sustains the general accuracy of the census figures, except in the case of the Darjeeling District, to which the census figures give a prominent position in the scale of leprosy, while the Civil Surgeon (Dr. Purves) asserts that the disease is very rare. Localization of leprosy. Lepers per 10,000 of population. Beerbhum ...     41.2 Bancoorah ...     30.0 Burdwan ...     22.6  5.    The reports contain some evidence on the  important  subject of the localization of the disease, or the  excessive prevalence of it in some localities as compared with others. The census figures of 1872 rendered this fact apparent, when divisions and districts were com- pared. The Burdwan Division was found to present, as compared with other divisions and with the whole Province, a remarkable excess of lepers (16.5 per 10,000 of popu- lation against 5.4), and the three districts of this division marginally indicated presented still higher figures and attained the notoriety of being among the most leprous localities of equal extent in British India. The reports now submitted indicate that the same truth obtains when sub-divisions of districts are compared. The instances in which this circumstance is most clearly brought out are these-  (a.) Sonthal Pergunnahs.-Of 515 lepers registered in the census returns 314 belonged to the Dumka and Jamtara Sub-Divisions bordering on Beerbhum. (b.) Burdwan.-The proportion of lepers in different thannahs varied from 2 to 58 per 10,000. (c.) Beerbhum.-Numbers in different thannahs vary from 145 to 754 (proportion to population not given). (d.) Moorshedabad.-Larger proportion of lepers in the thannahs adjoining Beerbhum (West of the River Bagiruttee). (e.)    Dacca.-Thannah  ratios vary from 0.2 to 7.2 per 10,000. (f.) Backergunge.-Chiefly found in certain (specified) villages. (g.) Rungpur.-Thannah ratios vary from 1.7 to 11.9 per 1,000 of population. (h.)    Nuddea.-More common in the town of Santipur. (i.)    Rajshahye.-An excess of lepers in Nattore and Lallpur. In other districts the disease is said to be equally diffused or the point is not mentioned. Reasons are assigned in some cases for an excess of lepers. Large towns and religious shrines are said to attract them for obvious reasons ; but this does not explain the matter to any material extent. The fact may be accepted as established that the disease prevails exces- sively in certain localities capable of geographical definition, and there undoubtedly appears to be a well-marked leprosy area not very accurately defined as yet in the Burdwan Division, which
(   3   ) embraces also portions of the adjoining districts of Moorshedabad and Sonthal Pergunnahs. Dr. Joubert, in his report on the Burdwan District, gives a list of specially leprous villages. The peculiarities of these leprous localities have not as yet been studied, though such a study would probably (if properly conducted) throw more light on the causation of the disease than any other species of inquiry. Physical peculiarities of leprous areas. 6.    The evidence on this point  is  very  unsatisfactory.    In  the case of   Burdwan and Moorsheda- bad the specially affected localities are said to possess a laterite soil and the exempted localities an alluvial. In Rungpur the laterite tracts are reported to be least affected, and the alluvial and marshy most; while in Dacca, of the two worst thannahs, one is said to belong to the laterite formation, and the other to the alluvial and water-logged tract. The Civil Surgeon of Balasore mentions that leprosy is more prevalent among the inhabitants of villages on the sea-coast than in the interior; but it is quite certain that the disease is worse in other districts for inland than in any part of Balasore. The relations of the disease to geology and physical geography, soil, water, elevation and drainage are, as far as these reports are concerned, as obscure as ever. Sanitary and domestic condition. 7.    Nor does the  evidence  adduced  throw  much  light on its relations  to sanitary and domestic conditions.    Filth,    overcrowding, defective ventilation, &c., are mentioned by several reporters as causes; but it is not shown anywhere that these conditions are peculiar to, or specially aggravated in, the localities in question. The same remark applies to poverty and impoverished diet. Nor do the papers contain any proof that any special kind of diet causes the disease. On the contrary, Dr. Crombie shows that the leprous and non-leprous partake of similar food. Fish, whether fresh or salted or putrid, has evidently no influence; for it is nowhere shewn that the leprous are consumers of these articles, and the non-leprous not so. There is indeed some evidence to the opposite effect. Some reporters remark that it is a disease of poverty and the poorer classes; but it is quite certain that the rich are not exempt, and the immense preponderance in the community of the poorer classes is not taken into account, nor the fact that the disease itself impoverishes its victims. Dr. Ghose, in his report on the Rungpur District, makes an attempt to establish a causative relation between this disease and malarious diseases and parasitic skin diseases; but the most malarious districts and tracts in the Province are certainly not the most leprous. Dr. Crombie shews the same thing with regard to the District of Dacca. Syhpilis and salivation. 8.    Syphilis and mercurial salivation have acquired the popular reputation    of   being    causes   of leprosy,  and this    current   belief crops out frequently in these reports, but that these influences are not necessarily or specially causative of leprosy is certain from the circumstance that syphilis and salivation have been and are very common where leprosy is rare or unknown both in and out of India. Nor even in cases where it is shewn that a certain number of the leprous have been the subjects of syphilis is it proved that the pro- portion is larger than among the non-leprous. It is possible that, as surmised by Dr. Stewart, syphilis may determine the manifestation of the outer signs of leprosy in one predisposed hereditarily or other- wise to the disease, and this may be the real history of such cases as that related by Mr. Lyons in his report on Noakholly.
( 4 ) Race or caste. 9.    The reports do not indicate that any race or caste of Natives is specially liable in leprosy.    In one report   a statement is  made that Hindus are more liable (Burdwan); in another that Muhammadans (Nuddea); and in another that they are equally liable (Purnea); one, (Bancoorah) that Natives of Aryan descent are less subject than aboriginal tribes; in another (Sonthal Pergunnahs) that Bengalis (Aryans) are more subject than Sonthals (aborigines). In Jalpaiguri the disease is said to be more prevalent among the Mechs of the Terrai, a mongrel race half Aryan and half aboriginal, than among Aryans, while in Chittagong  " up-country men" form the majority of lepers. Without multiplying illustrations of the contradictions which different reports evince, suffice it to state that the evidence contained in them will not bear comparison or analysis. The inquiry with regard to the etiological influence of race and caste, if any, is so delicate and difficult that the evidence ought to be very searching and exact. Thus the reports agree in stating that leprosy prevails to excess in low Hindu castes (Bowries, Jalias, &c.,) and among the poorer sections of the Muhammadan population; but the numerical prepon- derance of these classes is not taken into account, nor does it appear that the condition of the same or similar castes elsewhere has been studied or considered. Moreover, there are traces of the influence of caste prejudices in the papers, noteably in the memorandum contributed to Dr. Stewart by the Hindu Deputy Magistrate in the report of Surgeon Russick Lall Dutt, Civil Surgeon of Bancoorah, and in the report on the District of Hooghly which, though signed by Surgeon W. H. Gregg, has evidently been composed mainly on information derived from a Hindu Assistant Surgeon. Hereditary transmission. 10.    The concensus of opinion on the subject of heredity is re- markable. Hereditary predisposition is allowed by all the reporters, who discuss the subject, to be one of the main factors of the disease. In some cases opinions are supported by figures. Surgeon Z. A. Ahmed (Sonthal Pergunnahs) found that of 59 cases personally investigated by him, hereditary transmission could be traced in 30-a high per- centage. Dr. Picachy, of Purneah, details 10 cases, in one of which there is a history of hereditary descent. Dr. Joubert (Burdwan found that 13 out of 30 cases treated in the Leper Asylum) acknowledged an ancestral taint. Surgeon R. T. Wright (Jessore) states that 54  out of 619  cases inherited  the disease, but the statement is given on information furnished by the Police. Surgeon W. D. Stewart (Cuttack) gives details of eight cases, in six of which he elicited a family taint. Dr. Ghose, of Rungpur, person- ally investigated 378 cases, in eleven of which there was a hereditary history. These figures are few and vague, but they go to support a conclusion which is now unchallenged, namely, that in a large pro- portion of cases of leprosy a family history can be discovered. The proportion, depending in most cases on the testimony of the sufferers, is likely to be understated, and probably a searching inquiry would increase it. The reports do not afford any detailed information on the manner of transmission whether, for example, as surmised by Drs. Lewis and Cunningham in their report on leprosy in Kumaon, transmission is more frequent in the female than the male line. Alleged heredity in a leprous locality is subject to the fallacy that the causes of the disease, whatever they are, are operative upon persons related as well as on persons not related. And to establish the influence of heredity it would be necessary to take this considera- tion fully into account, and even admitting the causative influence of
?(    5    ) heredity, the conditions of its latency or manifestation have still to be worked out. Cases of the leprous or predisposed emigrating to non- leprous places, as in the well known instances of the Norwegian Colony in Western America, afford the best opportunity for investigat- ing the subject of transmission; and, on the other hand, cases arising de novo in which no family history exists offer the best material for investigating causation apart from transmission. The whole question of heredity is thus a complicated and difficult one, and requires very delicate handling, and the evidence recorded in these reports simply amount to a support protanto of a conclusion gained by more discriminating inquiry elsewhere, notably in Norway. Contagion. 11.    The subject of contagion is a still more difficult one, because it is necessary to eliminate, in order to establish it, so many other condi- tions-most of them obscure, and more especially heredity and common local influences. It is certain, however, that there exists in India a firm popular belief that the disease is capable of communication by contact more particularly by sexual intercourse. None of the in- stances of apparent contagion given in these reports-and they are pretty numerous-will bear criticism, because other possible causes of manifestation have not been considered and eliminated. The most striking cases are those related by Surgeon Z. A. Ahmed in the report on the Sonthal Pergunnahs; Dr. Picachy in the Purneah report; Surgeon W. Duncan, Jalpaiguri; Surgeon R. D. Murray, Chittagong; Surgeon C. H. Joubert, Burdwan; Dr. Green, Serampore; Dr. Ghose, Burdwan; and Dr. Gregg, Hooghly. They are, however, too indefinite to bear critical discussion. Sex. 12.    The preponderance of males affected with leprosy in India is a very remarkable circumstance; but this may, for reasons already given, be more apparent than real. In Norway where the careful and syste- matic registration of lepers is carried out under the orders of Govern- ment by a strong special agency, the proportions are reported to be 129 males to 1 female. Dr. Vandyke Carter, who has specially in- vestigated the subject in the Bombay Presidency, gives the proportion as 438 to 1. Drs. Lewis and Cunningham found the proportion of admissions into the asylum at Almorah to be males 15 to 1 female. The statistics given in these reports support the general conclusion that the disease is more frequently seen among men than women. Thus of 59 cases seen by Surgeon Z. A. Ahmed in twelve villages 45 were males and 14 females, or 32 to 1, and of 378 seen by Dr. Ghose in Rungpur 253 were males and 125 females, or 2 to 1. The figures given by other reporters have been obtained from the census returns and show even higher ratios. Age. 13.    That leprosy is a disease of adult life has been fully demon- strated, and the evidence contained in these reports goes to support the conclusion. The youngest subject mentioned is a female child of seven seen at Jalpaiguri by Surgeon W. Duncan. There are no facts to show whether the disease appears earlier, or later, in males, or females. Varieties. 14.    Some of the reporters describe the forms of leprosy seen by them; but there is nothing new or noteworthy  in   these  details.    All who notice the matter agree in affirming that the ansthetic variety of the disease is more commonly prevalent than the tuberculated. Drs. Lewis and Cunningham found in the Almorah Asylum 49 cases of
?(    6    ) the former against twelve of the latter, fifteen presenting character- istics of the "mixed" and four of the eruptive variety. Of Surgeon Ahmed's 59 cases 27 were ansthetic and 13 tuberculated. Dr. Joubert gives a still higher proportion-28 out of 30 treated in the Burdwan Leper Asylum. It is curious to contrast these figures with the results in Norway, where the tuberculated and ansthetic varieties of leprosy hold the relative proportions of 70 and 30 per cent., and in Sicily where the ansthetic variety is said to be "somewhat" more common than the tuberculated. Treatment. 15.    The reports contain very little  information of value on the subject  of    treatment.      Patients were treated    by   several  of   the reporters with gurjun oil, but a difficulty was experienced in getting them to persevere in the treatment. Some benefit was obtained in most instances from its use; but the relief was neither radical nor permanent in any case. D. N. M.-Home, Rev & Agri. Dept. Press-No. 457-15-8-79-100.
No. 856, dated Fort William, the 24th October 1878. From-R. COCKBURN, Esq.,   Deputy   Surgeon General,   Presidency Circle,         in charge Surgeon General's Office, Indian Medical Dept.

IN continuation of this Office  letters  No.  598, dated 27th July 1876, and  No.   1336,   dated 11th December 1877, I have the honour to submit ten reports on  the  sub- ject of leprosy,  received  from the districts   marginally   enumerated. The only  report now wanting to complete the  provisional series is that due from the District of Mal- dah, but I understand that, owing to changes which have occurred in the medical charge of that district, no report need be expected. This may, therefore, be accepted as the last instalment of the reports called for in your letter No. 1272, dated 30th March 1875.          2.    The reports  submitted  with letter No. 1336 above-cited were subsequently returned direct by the Home Department  for   comment and opinion.    They were subjected to a careful analysis,  and  a  letter was submitted (No. 1674, dated 12th February) containing the results of that analysis,  and rendering  prominent such points as the reports illustrated,  and  such  conclusion   as  the evidence contained in them appeared  to justify.    This  letter was,  in the absence of instructions to the contrary, submitted direct to the Home Department.          3.    The reports now forwarded are  exceedingly  meagre,   and do not contain any information of importance, or any  facts  which mili- tate against the conclusions drawn from  the  preceding  series, which were stated in the letter to the Home Department  alluded  to  in  the last paragraph. 4.    None of the districts included in the present  series  appear to be specially leprous, nor do the reports indicate localization  of the disease in any  particular  part  of any of them,  unless  the  circum- stance mentioned in  Surgeon  Comins'  report,  that a Muhammadan village in the South of the State of Kuch   Behar contains an  unusu- ally  large  proportion   of lepers,   be  accepted    as    an   instance    of localization.    The  spurious  localization  caused  by leprous  beggars being attracted to towns and centres of pilgrimage is noticed by some of the reporters. 5.    No  new  facts  of importance  bearing  on   the   question   of causation are mentioned.    Surgeons Hill, of Monghyr,   and  Comins, of Kuch Behar, state that Muhammadans are more liable to the disease than Hindus, and connect  this   circumstance with the  dirtier  habits and flesh diet of the  former.    The reports  previously submitted con- tained contradictory evidence on this subject,  and  Assistant Surgeon Ram Chunder Goopta's allegation, that the consumption of the  flesh of the buffalo is a cause of the disease, is very questionable. 6.    Poverty, syphilis and hereditary transmission are again pro- minently assigned as causes;  but,  as  regards  the  two  former,  the evidence is  not  demonstrative,  and the latter cannot always be dis- covered or traced.    Surgeon Hill and Assistant Surgeon  Ram Chun- der Goopta give facts which go to prove that cohabitation of a leper with a non-leprous  wife  does not necessarily impart the disease to the latter.
?(   2   ) 7. The reports tend to confirm the conclusion's drawn from previous reports, that the disease is more common among men than women, and that the ansthetic form of it is more common than the tubercular or mixed. No. 1112, dated Alipore, the 9th October 1878. From-J. F. P. McCONNELL, Esq., M. B., Offg. Civil Surgeon, 24-Pergun- nahs, Alipore. To-The Offg. Surgeon General for Bengal, Calcutta. IN reply to your memorandum No. 2562 of the 25th ultimo, inviting- early attention to Surgeon General Beatson's Office Circular No. 134 of the 20th Decem- ber 1876, I have the honour to state that, having but recently joined this appoint- ment, and being therefore quite unacquainted with the district, I am unable to furnish from personal observations or investigations the report on leprosy called for. I can only submit (herewith) a statement compiled from records which have accumulated in this Office during several months past. 2.    The majority  of these   are   in the vernacular, and   consist of returns for- warded by Inspectors  and   Sub-Inspectors of Police from the several sub-divisions, thannahs, &c., of this district.    These have not only been difficult  to translate, but also, from  the  very  nature   of the  enquiry   and the lack   of proper knowledge or education by the officials employed, are incomplete and not altogether trustworthy. 3.     It is feared, for   example,   that  the  proportion   of female   to male  lepers reported is unduly small.    Questions   as  to   the influence of contagion or infection, of peculiaritly in diet, of local   topography,   &c.,   in  the propagation and prevalence of the  disease  remain   unanswered,   and, from   a   careful perusal of the  returns, it seems probable that some cases of leucoderma  and   of secondary  syphilis (eruptive stages) have been mistaken for, and therefore included among the truly leprous.

F. P. McCONNELL, M. B., Offg. Civil Surgeon, 24-Pergunnahs. No. 10, dated Bankipur, the 16th January 1878. From-B. SIMPSON, Esq., M. D., Civil Surgeon, Patna. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Dinapore Circle. IN reply to your memorandum No. 3017, dated 31st October last, forwarding memorandum No. 4770 A, dated 26th October 1877, from the Surgeon General's Office, I have the honour to state that the circular No. 134, on the subject of leprosy therein alluded to, appears never to have reached this Office up to 3rd Nov- ember last, on which date it was forwarded from your Office at my request. On receipt of it I immediately wrote to the Assistant Surgeons in charge of the several dispensaries in this district, and have the honour to annex their replies. That of the Assistant Surgeon of Behar is of no value whatever, as he has apparently
(   3    ) classed as cases of typical leprosy lepra vulgaris, a disease never intended by Gov- ernment, I presume, to be included under the head of leprosy at all. So much confusion exists on this head that, in order to render reports of any value, it would be well, I think, to specify more particularly the varieties of the disease regarding which the Government wish for information. If it be the disease as described by Dr. Vandyke Carton in his able treatise, I can state from personal observation that it is not at all prevalent in any part of this district near the sadr station, nor, as far as I can gather, at any of the sub-divisions. The 42 cases mentioned in the report of the Assistant Surgeon of Behar Sub- Division as typical cases of leprosy, on his own admission, consist entirely of lepra vulgaris and alphoides, now generally classed under the head of "Alphos". Almost all the lepers I have met with within the sadr station have been itinerant beggars from other districts, and such also is the experience of Assistant Surgeon Bollye Chunder Sen, who has charge of the Temple School Hospital. The ordinary duties of an Assistant Surgeon in charge of a sub-division demand his constant presence on the spot, and it is exceedingly difficult for him to collect trustworthy information regarding a disease of this kind, unless time were afforded him for travelling about to inspect localities where leprosy was reported to be prevalent. From all the enquiries I have been able to make, the disease is not endemic in any part of this district. A further report has been called for regarding the villages of Emadpur, where seven lepers are reported by the Assistant Surgeon of Behar. Should the particulars prove of any interest, I will forward them as soon as the information is received. No. 100 H, dated Bankipur, the 6th December 1877. From-Babu BOLLYE CHUNDER SEN, Assistant Surgeon, Bankipur. To-The Civil Surgeon of Patna. WITH reference to your circular memorandum No. 555, dated 11th ultimo, and enclosure, I have the honour to report for your information that I have no local knowledge of the causation of leprosy in this district, and the few patients that have come under my observation were itinerant beggars not belonging to this district, and whose disease was not caused by any local influence whatever. In some the disease was hereditary, in others it was due to insufficient food and exposure to heat and cold under unfavourable circumstances, in a few there was history of syphilis with abuse of mercury, but it is more than doubtful whether they had any influence in the causation of the disease. No. 85, dated Patna, the 5th December 1877. From-Babu RAM  CHUNDER GOOPTA, Assistant Surgeon, Patna. To-The Civil Surgeon of Patna. WITH reference to your circular memorandum No. 555, I have the honour to inform you that I have no reliable information whether leprosy is endemic in any part of this district, but both in this city as well as at Behar (where I stopped for six months in 1875) I saw and distributed medicines to many persons suffering from the disease. Out of 15,144 patients who attended this out-door dispensary in 1876, 139 were those suffering from leprosy. There are at present two cases of leprosy (males) in hospital-one a low caste Pasee and the other a Gowala. The former had a leper grandmother of his mother's side, and he contracted the disease some time after performing her funeral ceremony; the latter could not trace out anything as to the cause of his disease. Three cases of leprosy have also been attending the out-door dispensary-one male and two females. The former is a resident of Jodpur, and Bunnea by caste, and he inherited the disease from his mother; and the latter could not account for the disease. Be- sides the hereditary taint, there is a popular notion in this part of the country that the free use of the flesh of a buffalo causes leprosy. Many times I enquired of my leper patients if they were using the flesh of a buffalo, and on many occasions I received the reply that they had been using it, but left off taking if after con- tracting the disease, having had the impression that the buffalo flesh was the cause of the disease. Syphilis is another cause of leprosy. Too much use of beef and that of the musoor-ke-dal are also said to cause leprosy. As far as my experience is concerned, leprosy is not contagious. I knew a man to have been suffering from tubercular leprosy for a period of twenty years, and all this time his wife was
( 4 ) keeping close to him, and still she was quite free from the disease. Moreover, of the male patients at present under my treatment, two are married men and have been living with their wives for a long time, and the wives have not been suffering from leprosy. Dated Barrh, the 23rd November 1877. From-ZAHEERUDEEN, Assistant Surgeon, Barrh. To-The Civil Surgeon of Patna. I BEG to report the following report on leprosy  as  prevalent in the Barrh Sub- Division. 2.    Leprosy exists, but not to a large extent, in the Barrh Sub-Division. I am unable  to  give  the  exact number of lepers residing in Barrh ; but, from my expe- rience of four years, I can say that the number is not large as in other places.    Out of 19,558 out-patients admitted into  the   Barrh Charitable Dispensary during  the years   1874-75-76,  and  up to   the   end  of October 1877, only 54 cases of leprosy attended for medicine. 3.    The  disease  under consideration is  found   spread  throughout the   sub- division, and not localized to any particular place. 4.    The nature of the respective  places  in   which the  individuals  labouring under  this  malady,  and  the  conditions   and circumstances under which they live, does not bear any peculiarity in its form, excepting that the majority of the persons are  poor.    Very  few lepers are  seen amongst  the higher classes and well-to-do people. 5.    Most of the cases who attended  the  dispensary  had  previous   attacks  of syphilis.    This  disease  was  no doubt  the  only cause from which they eventually got the malady in question.    In other cases the persons inherited the   malady from their parents or forefathers. No. A, dated Behar, the 25th December 1877. From-DR. PREUMBER NATH  MITTER,  Assistant  Surgeon  of Behar,  on leave. To-The Civil Surgeon of Patna. WITH reference to your circular memorandum No. 555 of the 11th November last, I have the honour to report that, during my one year's incumbency here, I had occasion of treating only eighteen cases in leprosy and psoriasis. Besides these, through the help of the thannadar of the station, I could examine 42 patients, of whom the majority, as many as 33, were from the town and its neighbourhood. Seventeen of these 42 persons were cases of the typical form of the disease, namely, lepra vulgaris, having had round, reddish patches of various dimensions covered with thin, white scabs, and scattered over different parts of the body, particularly the face and the distal parts of the extremities. Of these typical lepers, ten were Hindu male, three Hindu female, and four Muhammadan male. The remaining 25 cases appeared to be of the milder form, the lepra alphoides, and its allied variety, with eruptions smaller and whiter than the foregoing, and consisted of seventeen Hindu male, one Hindu female, and seven Muhammadan male. Of all the lepers examined, thirteen had hereditary taint and two appeared to have acquired the complaint from syphilis, bearing copper-coloured eruptions. The distribution of these hereditary cases are shown in the following table :    Diseases Residence of the patient CASTE. In the jurisdiction of.   Hindu male. Hindu female. Muhammadan male.

?(5) As far as I have yet been able to ascertain, the disease does not seem to be prevalent in any part of the sub-division, nor that there can be noticed any tract where it is especially located. All that can be said at present under this head is that in one and the same village, Emadpur, there are some seven lepers. The extent to which leprosy exists in the sub-division can hardly be correctly ascertained, unless the Deputy Magistrate be requested to take a census of all the persons suffering from the disease; or that some sort of arrangement be made to enable the medical man of the station to travel from village to village, with the view of gathering particulars in regard to the prevalence, causation, localization, and other facts connected with the complaint. No. 6, dated Monghyr, the 2nd January 1878. From-H. W. HILL, Esq., M. B., Civil Surgeon, Monghyr. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Dinapore. WITH reference to your No. 3456, dated 29th ultimo, I have the honour to submit the leprosy report therein asked for. The cause of delay in submitting the report was owing to the non-receipt of the Surgeon General's Circular No. 134, dated 20th December 1876. It was only received on 15th November last. No. 1. Leprosy. IN the absence of statistics, it is not possible to form an accurate estimate of the extent to which leprosy prevails in this district, but judging from the number of leprous patients that we meet with when passing by the road or presenting themselves in the hospital for treatment, I have arrived at the conclusion that leprosy is not uncommon here. The total number of cases of leprosy treated in the Monghyr dispensary during the five years from 1872 to 1876 was 256; the total number from all causes 40,267 ; so that leprosy formed .06 per cent. of the totals treated. 2.    Leprosy is found mostly among the lowest  classes  of society.    I  believe it  is   much   more common among the lower orders of Muhammadans than those of the   Hindus.    This   is  due  to the difference in habits and the nature of the   food. The Hindu, as a rule, is  religiously  enjoined   to   daily ablutions   in   the   Ganges, where  practicable,   or in  some  other  clean   water;   he seldom takes fish or meat; while the Mussalman is dirty in his habits, does not care to take a bath,   and lives mostly upon fish and putrid flesh, such as beef or buffalo's flesh. 3.    In a few  instances   a  hereditary   transmission   of the  disease   might   be traced.    I  have  met  with   no  case  in  which contagion has been suspected as the cause.    I am acquainted with several married lepers, but in  none   was   the   disease transmitted  by  sexual  intercourse.    In many instances the disease has been attri- buted to syphilitic infection, and I believe this to be the  most  fertile  cause   of the disease  in this   district.    There is no special locality to which it is confined, but is equally distributed over the district. 4.    Ansthetic variety is the most common; in   fact, nearly  three-fourths  of the cases belong to this class.    Almost every day we meet with patients in the out- door dispensary complaining of patches of ansthesia in several parts   of the body. The   colour of the affected parts is fainter than the natural hue of the skin.    This is known by the common name sunbahiri (i.   e.,  ansthesia).    These  patches  rapidly increase  in   size,   but  in  some  instances  they   remain stationary for a long time. The tubercular variety is not so   common,  but  in most of these cases both varieties are combined.    This is the worst form  of the disease, and  most   of the   miserable creatures  we  meet  with  in the  roadside,   devoid of fingers and toes, and covered with loathsome ulcers. 5.    It appears to be more common among males than females. 6.     Gurjun oil, which has been so much used of late years, does  not  hold   out the  prospect  of bringing  about  a radical cure of the disease.    No doubt by long continued use   there would be an improvement.    The ulcers heal and the  tubercular form  disappears  under its  use.    As soon as the oil is stopped all the symptoms re- appear as before, no case of perfect cure being yet heard of here.
?(6) No. 71, dated Arrah, the 10th November 1877. From-J. C. SHAW, Esq., Offg. Civil Surgeon, Shahabad. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Dinapore Circle. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your memorandum No. 3017 of the 31st ultimo, with copy of memorandum No. 4770 A of 26th idem, from the Secretary to the Surgeon General, Indian Medical Department, and to state that as I have only seen and read the circular from the Office of the Surgeon General (No. 134, dated 30th December 1876) on the subject of a report on leprosy, to which the above-quoted correspondence has special reference, within the last week, and not having had any intimation previously of its existence, I have not had time to pay particularly careful attention to leprosy as it occurs in this district, and I therefore regret that the remarks I have to offer must necessarily be brief and meagre. 2. Leprosy does not seem to be a common disease in Shahabad, and the opportunities of observing cases are very limited. I have not seen more than two lepers in the town of Arrah and its vicinity, and 1 have ascertained from enquiries that there are only a few who are professional beggars. This was also the expe- rience of my predecessor, Dr. Thornton, which he communicated to you in his letter No. 32 of the 30th June 1875, and he was Civil Surgeon of Shahabad for over five years. I do not remember to have seen a single case when in the district on inspec- tion duty. There have been two leprous prisoners in the jail since January last, and the number of cases seen at the sadr dispensary in the course of each month is from four to six only. Just at present there are none in attendance. I am told by Natives that leprosy is very common on the other side of the Ganges, but of this I have no personal knowledge. No. 232, dated Ranchi, the 7th December 1877. From-F. R. SWAINE, Esq., M. B., Offg. Civil Surgeon, Ranchi. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Indian Medical  Department, Dinapore Circle. IN accordance with the Surgeon General's circular memorandum No. 134, dated the 20th December 1876, I have the honour to report that leprosy does not prevail in this district. The Kls and other tribes appear to be singularly free from it. During the past year only six cases have been admitted into the charitable dis- pensary for treatment, and out of these none were natives of this district. Some were pilgrims, on their way from the North-West to Pooree, and others were beggars resident here, who came for treatment when their symptoms became aggravated. There are no special peculiarities or conditions to be noticed, and the disease cannot be said to be localized to any one place in the district. The delay in the submission of this report has been due to the non-receipt of the Surgeon General's circular quoted above. No. 294, dated Kuch Behar, the 7th November 1877. From-Dr.   D.  W.   D.   COMINS,   Acting   Civil   Surgeon,   Kuch   Behar Division. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Dinapore. I HAVE the honour to forward a report on the causation and distribution of leprosy as observed in Kuch Behar, and report that, owing to the short notice I received, the information I am able to give in the form desired should be so scanty. The total number of lepers in the State last year amounted to 392, or in the ratio of 1 to 1,275, or 7.8 lepers to 10,000 of the population-a very different num- ber from that which Drs. Lewis and Cunningham found to exist (1.6 per 10,000) in the neighbouring country of Assam. The proportion of Muhammadans to Hindus is as 1 to 2.6; amongst those attacked with leprosy as 1 to 1.8; showing that the disease affects Muham- madans more than Hindus-a result the truth of which is supported by popular opinion.
(    7    ) The cause of leprosy may, I think, be hereditary or acquired, and syphilis and scrofula appear to be the diseases which, in the parent, most frequently lead to the development of leprosy in the child. Notwithstanding Dr. Carter's adverse opinion, the number of cases which have a syphilitic family history afford a very strong presumption that there is a connection between the two diseases. The people of this country feed principally on rice, vegetable, curries and fish, and in the cold weather dahee (curdled milk) is occasionally used, but from necessity, not from prejudice. Except in the case of the cow, they are not a flesh-eating people. In the South of the State, however, I am informed that the Muhammadans who live near the border eat any cattle that may happen to die from disease or otherwise. This is interesting, for leprosy is much more common amongst them in that part than in their neighbours the Hindus. The rice which is eaten by the lower classes is of inferior quality, which has been gathered only three or four months, and is therefore highly unwholesome and indigestible, and but little care is taken to remove the whole of the outer husk. How far this is a cause of leprosy I am unable to say. I do not think that much mouldy or decayed rice is eaten, though a case of gangrene of the extremities a few months ago was apparently due to this cause. Dall, on account of its price, is not eaten by the people generally, and cannot therefore be looked upon as a possible cause of disease. I am not able to discover that leprosy is less prevalent amongst the residents on the banks of the larger rivers, who drink the pure snow waters of the Himalayas, than with those who obtain their supplies from the nearest jheel. With regard to its distribution. It appears to be more common in the South than in the North of the State; more often met with on the borders than in the interior; more frequent amongst Muhammadans than Hindus; amongst men, than women and children; and amongst the poor and badly-fed, than with the rich and well-to-do. There are one or two places in the State of very bad repute for this disease, notably a village in the South, which is occupied by the Muhammadans before refer- red to, and another village towards the North, which I intend to visit, as well as other neighbourhoods where the disease is prevalent, and in which I hope to find an opportunity of better observation of the disease and the materials for a more interesting report. Memorandum No. 217, dated Dinapore, the 6th November 1877. [His No. 3017, dated 31st October 1877.] THE undersigned having no experience regarding the prevalence of leprosy in this district, and no data on which to base a report, is unable to supply one. Dr. C. Macnamara, who gave some attention to this subject some years ago, sent in a report, but no copy can be found in the Office. He would willingly send in a return shewing the number of cases treated in the dispensaries, but finds that all varieties are entered under one head, and have not been distinguished separately, so that such a return would be useless. Dr. Gayer, he believes, has previously reported to similar effect. C. J. JACKSON, M. D. Civil Surgeon, Mozufferpur. To the Deputy Surgeon General, Dinapore. No. 408, dated Hazaribagh, the 3rd November 1877. From-Dr. EDWARD A. BIRCH, Civil Surgeon, Hazaribagh. To-The Deputy Surgeon General, Dinapore Circle. IN reply to No. 4770 A, dated October 1877, from the Secretary to the Sur- geon General, I have the honour to say that I submitted a report last year upon the subject of leprosy, the receipt of which is acknowledged in letter No. 3797 of 5th December 1876, from Under Secretary to the Government of Bengal, Judi- cial Department, to the address of the Surgeon General. I have since made many inquiries, but I have been unable to obtain any addi- tional information on the subject. Leprosy is rare in this district, particularly rare, I believe. I myself have seen but very few cases since I have filled my present office, and these few were pilgrims to or from Juggurnath. At this moment I am not aware that a single
?(8) resident of this town or immediate neighbourhood is the subject of leprosy, and I have been at some pains to ascertain. I have heard that there are a few lepers resident at the Northern foot of Parusnath Hill, but I have never seen them, nor from enquiry have I been able to verify the assertion. Such, however, is possible, for they, as beggars, may be attracted to Madhubun by the large number of rich pilgrims who visit the temples and mountain in the year.

WITH reference to your memorandum No. 3358, dated the 15th instant, I have the honour to state in reply that during the current year 27 cases of leprosy were treated as out-patients at the sadr dispensary by the Assistant Surgeon. Of the total number treated, two were females and the remainder males, and eighteen were Hindus and nine Mussalmans. With one exception, the patients all belonged to this district. As regards the varieties of the disease, five were ansthetic leprosy, two leu- coderma, and twenty cases of leprous eruptions, with loss of fingers, toes, &c. None of the patients attended regularly at the dispensary, several were never seen a second time; so that no continuous history of the progress of the cases can be given.

WITH reference to your memorandum No. 1202, dated the 2nd ultimo, calling for a report on the treatment of leprosy with gurjun oil, I have the honour to state that circular No. 134 of the 20th December 1876 was not received by me till the 25th ultimo, when I got a copy by writing for it, and that I have not used gurjun oil in the treatment of the disease here. There are two lepers in the jail at pre- sent-one a native of Cuttack, and sentenced to two months' imprisonment at Goalundo, where he was employed in the railway; the other prisoner is a native of Rajnagar, in this district. But these cases are not so bad as to require admission to hospital. Out-patients occasionally come to the dispensary, but special attention was not directed to their treatment by gurjun oil, or to the recording of their cases. I am unable, therefore, to furnish any report on the treatment of the disease by gurjun oil at present. Leprosy is not very prevalent in this district. The census returns give 417 lepers in a population of 1,012,589, or .0412 per cent. I am not aware of its being especially prevalent in any particular portion of the district, but scattered cases are found almost everywhere, and chiefly in large towns where they find it easier to live on the charity of others. Of the two lepers now in jail, the disease is acknowledged to be hereditary in one, that is, the man from Cuttack; the other prisoner says none of his ancestors had the disease. There are no other lepers at present under my observation. There was a beggar with very bad leprosy that used to come for alms, but I did not see him lately; probably he is dead.

?No. 3247, dated Lucknow, the 19th July 1876. From-Major A. MURRAY, Offg. Personal Assistant to  the  Chief   Com- missioner of Oudh. To-The Offg. Under Secretary to the Government of India. WITH reference to previous correspondence ending with your letter No. 2-75, dated 18th March 1875, I am directed to submit the accompanying copy of the report of the Officiating Sanitary Com- missioner on the prevalence of leprosy in this Province, with its enclosures in original. Report on Leprosy  in  Oudh  by  A.  GARDEN,  Esq.,   M.  D.,   Officiating   Sanitary Commissioner, Oudh, dated Lucknow, the 14th July 1876. THE information called for in para. 8, Government of India Resolution No. 1-136, dated 5th March 1875, on the prevalence of leprosy in Oudh, embraces the following points: I.-The  extent  to   which  leprosy  exists  amongst  the  people  in  each district. II.-If localised, the localities in which it is chiefly found. III.-The special peculiarities of the locality, if there be any, and the special conditions in other respects  under which  the people in   this locality exist. IV.-Evidence derived from individual  cases, of the origin,   whether   here- ditary, by contagion or by other means. 2.    A summary of the evidence obtained  from  the  Civil  Surgeons on  these points is herewith submitted. 3.    I.-The extent to which leprosy exists in each district in Oudh. To decide this point returns were called for as follows: (1)     The number of lepers in poor-houses. (2)     The number of lepers in hospitals. (3)     The number of lepers in jails. (4)    The number of lepers ascertained by  enquiry,  either  personally  or through district officers, to exist  in   certain areas  of greater or less extent amongst the population at large in each district. 4.    The figures obtained from Nos. 1 and 2 may  be dismissed at once as in no way bearing  on  the  subject  under  enquiry.    The  numbers  in  poor-houses and hospitals are and must be the result of purely exceptional circumstances. 5.    From jail returns possibly some  approximate idea might be gained  of the relative prevalence of lepers in the Province at large, but  for  individual districts 1a
(   2   ) nothing can be gained, as the populations dealt with are very small, and the absence of lepers would not show immunity of a district any more than one or two or many cases, as in the Central Prison, would indicate its exceptional prevalence. 6.    In the first returns submitted the figures could  not  be  totalled  so  as to give a general summary, as in some the total  population and number of lepers  was given, whilst in others the number of sick in hospital and of lepers was entered. 7.    In the subjoined statement the jail  population  and  number of lepers,  as they stood on 30th June 1876, is given for each jail.    On 30th June 1876 Ration per 1000 of lepers Hereditary Not Hereditary  Population Lepers    Lucknow central prism 1,716 20 11.65 ... 20 Ditto District Jail 637 2 3.14 ... 2 Unao 229 ... ... ...

The ratio 4.5 per mille is very high,  and  would  give, if true,  somewhat about 50,000 lepers in the Province ; but the circumstances of jail must be  looked on as exceptional, especially those of the Central   Prison,  as will be  evident if we examine at the figures  in   the  next table.    Thus  in  Fyzabad  the  ratio for  the district is 1.3, whilst that for the jail is 8.2. 9.    To arrive at an  accurate idea  of the  prevalence  of leprosy not  only in every district, but also of its greater or less prevalence in different portions of each, would necessitate a lepers' census-a matter of great difficulty and likely in the end to be very far from correct, as I think is very evident from the return obtained from Unao, the only district in which it was tried. 10.    The other alternative, that of guessing at the prevalence from the number of lepers found within certain towns and villages, or  areas  of limited extent,  was tried in the remaining districts, from which returns have been submitted. From Partabgarh and Hardui no information at all has been given.

If the figures are true,   leprosy must be exceptionally  common  in Rai Bareli, the ratio being 2.33 per mille and unusually rare in  Sultanpur.    In many instances, however, there are grave reasons for setting aside the  returns as untrue, irrespective of the strong chance of mistakes, through  the reticence of the lepers themselves and the non-detection or concealment of incipient cases. 12.    In Unao the  returns must be rejected,  as  leucoderma, an affection of the skin deemed leprous  by Natives, but not really  so,   has  been included.     In Bahraich are given only two towns with too small a population for the purpose. 13.    In Rai Bareli only such towns and villages were taken as contained more than three lepers each, and this gives some very startling results.    Thus in one village as many as 11.5 per mille were lepers, but then there were only three lepers and the village contained but 263 people. It is not so stated, but these may have been relatives and the disease hereditary ; and it  seems to me that it  is examples of this nature that have raised the ratio so high.    However the return possess no real value, since by picking out all the villages or hamlets without lepers one might easily  arrive at the opposite result, i.e., that leprosy is unknown in Rai Bareli. In Kheri a similar mistake was made. The question was most carefully examined into by the Civil Surgeon, but he took no account of the population of villages in which there were no lepers, and thus vitiated his returns. 14.    The utmost then that can be stated from these tables is that over one and under  two  per mille of  the population of Oudh probably is leprous, but that data are wanting  to  show  its  greater or less prevalence in any one district or parts  of districts. 15.    II.-If localised, &c. III.-Special peculiarities, &c. The replies on these points are quite negative. The disease is spread over the districts pretty uniformly and attacks all castes and all conditions of people having a preference for the worst fed, worst clothed and worst housed.
(   4   ) 16.    IV.-Evidence derived from individual cases  regarding origin by heredi- tary descent, contagion or by other means. That leprosy is hereditary there can be no doubt, but to what extent is by no means easy to ascertain- (1)   on account of the reticence shewn by  lepers  or  their  healthy relatives in allowing that the disease exists, or has existed in other members of the family ; (2)  because few Natives know aught concerning the state of health of grand- parents and of other relatives than their parents  and brothers and sisters;  and (3)   because the disease may be concealed, and I believe often is in its earliest stages and milder forms. 17.    The evidence furnished on this point is as under :    .                              Hereditary      Relative lepers          Grandfather Grandmother      Total cases Non-hereditary.

From this we find that out of 137 cases 26, or 18.9 per cent. had relatives affected.    I do not believe this represents the actual influence of hereditary in the propagation of leprosy for the reasons given above. 19.    In 43 cases (from my own note books) I found eight, or 18.1 per cent., had relatives  affected.    In  two the father and  in  one the mother, in four the uncles
(5) and in one a cousin were lepers, and in one instance both father and grandfather were such. 20. In one of the instances in which the father and son had it, there was this further point of interest, that in both the disease showed itself just at the same age. viz., 38 years. The Civil Surgeon of Unao, Surgeon Ghose, mentions a similar case within his own knowledge, where in one family the sons became lepers, and all at the same age; none of the daughters were affected. 21. These are examples of the known law that in hereditary disease there is always a tendency for it to show itself at the same age in each successive genera- tion afflicted, and this is of some interest in connection with a circumstance well known, and noted by most reporters, that children born of lepers, after the disease has shown itself, are most often healthy, which is not antagonistic to the hereditari- ness of leprosy, but depends on the facts that- (1) a leper need not necessarily beget a leper, his offspring may remain free all their lives; (2) that the tendency of this, like other hereditary diseases, is to return at a certain age; and (3) that without doubt atavism plays an important part in the hereditary descent of leprosy. 22. In 16 of the 26 cases the descent was direct from father or mother to sons, but out of all proportion from the father, and in one of these, two of his brothers besides were lepers. In one case a brother was also affected, but no information is given about father, mother or grandparents. Possibly it was heredi- tary from some previous generation. In three cases the grandparents, and not the parents, were lepers-examples of atavism. In three cases uncles were affected and not the parents. This points to descent from grandparents direct in the case of the uncles with the lapse of one gener- ation in the case of the patient. In one case a cousin was also affected. No mention is made of the uncle (father of the cousin) having been a leper. This also indicates hereditary descent with an intermission. 23. If atavism does play this role, it is at once evident how difficult it must be to get evidence on the question of comparative hereditary. The Civil Surgeon of Bahraich mentions a case somewhat interesting, though chiefly as showing the baneful effects of close intermarrying: "Two lepers are related", he writes, "to each other, and there are three albinos in the same family. The five individuals belong to a bradari of 22 houses or families. They are of the Bunnia caste, and they never marry out of their own bradari. One of the present three albinos had a nephew who was an albino, but is now dead". Albinism is well known to be hereditary, but it has no more connection with leprosy than leucoderma has. 24. On the question of contagion, all are unanimous that leprosy is not so communicated. I have been since 1861 constantly in the habit of seeing, ques- tioning and treating lepers, and I have never as yet come across a case of commu- nication by contact. Dr. A. Cameron, of Sultanpur, relates the following doubtful instances of what might be considered communication by contact: A boy, aged eight years, whose father had become affected with leprosy four years previously, remained with his 2 a
?(6) father, whilst his mother and two other children deserted them. The boy became leprous about a year after his father, whilst the two others who continued with the mother remained healthy. 25. Hereditary, or exposure to the same conditions of life as the father, will account for the son's leprosy quite as well as contagion. 26. Another suggested cause is syphilis, but there is just the same amount of evidence in favour of it as of contagion. It may be put aside, I think, as not being a cause of leprosy. 27. One reporter considers malaria to be a chief factor in the production of leprosy. It may or it may not be. There is no evidence to the fore on this point as yet. 28. The general opinion or feeling is that, whilst hereditary, it may arise as a disease de novo under general insanitary conditions, defective hygiene, want of clothing, and want of proper nutritious food; in fact that, when it shows itself de novo many men, it can be ascribed to no one conbination of circumstances suffi- ciently peculiar and succinct to be denominated the cause. 29. There is no doubt that it has a predilection for the male sex. Not one of the leper prisoners is a female, and the same thing is to be noticed in all the reports when everything is said of sex. Thus in Gonda, out of fourteen, ten were male and four female. 30. To sum up, in conclusion, the results of the enquiries amount to this- (1) That the prevalence of leprosy in most districts is still unknown, either from faulty methods in obtaining information, or from the number being too small to justify general deductions therefrom. (2) There is no evidence at command of its being more prevalent in one district than in another, or in one part of a district than in another, and in consequence there is no evidence as to peculiarities of locality, habits of life and surroundings which may or do act in the production of leprosy. To show the difficulty of finding evidence on this subject, I may mention that in the Lucknow Central Prison there are six prisoners lepers who did not show the disease until, in some instances, long after they had been inmates of the jail, where food, clothing and hygiene leave little to be desired. They all deny hereditary, but probably they were all descendants of leprous progenitors, or had acquired the disease before entering jail; otherwise we must ascribe it to conditions met with in jails. I have myself in former years seen similar cases. (3) That, whilst it is undoubtly hereditary, probably it is far more so than 18 per cent. or 19 per cent. represents. (4) That it does not spread by contagion and is not connected with syphilis. 31. If it is desirable to try and obtain more accurate information on the prevalence in Oudh of leprosy, the enquiry must be carried on with painstaking and care on some settled definite plan, so that the data supplied may have some chance of being alike for every district. The reports received from the civil medical officers are forwarded herewith.

?( 9 ) No. 45, dated Kheri, the 19th April 1875. From-F. W. HIGGINSON, Esq., Civil Surgeon of Kheri. To-The Sanitary Commissioner of Oudh. IN connexion with your No. 899 of 1875, I have the honour to supply the numerical data as to the prevalence of leprosy in this district you ask for. 2. I know of no locality in this district in which the disease is specially prevalent. Institution. Number of inmates on  Number of lepers among  the 17th April 1875. them. District Jail 214 None. Sadr Dispensary 6 in-patients; 36 out-patients None. Poor-house Nil. Nil. No. 37, dated Rheri, the 23rd March 1876. From-F. W. HIGGINSON, Esq., Civil Surgeon of Kheri. To-The Sanitary Commissioner of Oudh. IN reference to your No. 2814 of 1875, I have the honour to submit the follow- ing remarks concerning leprosy in this district. 2. While in camp in November and December last I took the opportunity of enquiring in all large villages I came across as to the number of lepers in each, and of examining the persons affected ; the results are here given : Name of town. Direction. Population No. of lepers. Sinjhai North 1,360 1 Dhaurahra East 3,000 3 Kheri South 5,639 11 Lakhimpur Ditto 2,482 3 Mitauli South-West 3,000 6 Aurangabad Ditto 5,000 11 Barwar West 4,500 2 Muhammadi Ditto 8,000 7  Aggregates 32,981 44 or 1.36 per mille. As these towns are situated at all points of the compass, the proportion of lepers to their population may fairly be taken as a representation of the proportion of lepers to the total population of the district; indeed the latter is less, probably, for in many small villages I found no lepers. 3. Excepting one at Muhammadi and the one at Sinjhai, none of these lepers were so ill as to be unable to follow their usual employments; they did not seem to be shunned by their fellow-townsmen and did not live alone; they were all of adult age. 4. There is no poor-house or leper asylum in this district. I have had no opportunity of trying the gurjun oil treatment at the dispensary or jail. 3 a
?(10) No. 87, dated Hardui, the 12th April 1875. From-R. D. LOGG, Esq., Civil Surgeon of Hardui. To-The Sanitary Commissioner of Oudh. WITH reference to your No. 898, dated 15th April 1875, on the subject of leprosy, I have the honour to offer the following observations: 1. As far as I am aware, leprosy is not prevalent in the district, but few cases coming under treatment at the dispensaries; and, as far as I can remember, only two cases have come under my observation in jail since I assumed charge in July 1873. 2. The disease is not specially prevalent in any of the numerous villages I have visited during my annual tours through the district; in fact, I have not seen a single case in any one of them: at the sadr station itself a few leper paupers are to be seen, but they never apply at the dispensary for treatment. I am consequently unable to state anything regarding them. 3. The third and fourth questions, after what I have stated above, need no reply. 4. With regard to the fifth question, viz., as to the mode of propagation of the disease, I regret to say that from the limited opportunities I have had of study- ing leprosy, I am not in a position to offer an opinion on the subject, but in the few cases I have had to treat at Partabgarh and Bharaich, and from all I have read regarding it, I incline to the belief that the disease has a syphillitic origin, and that it is at times inherited. No. 194, dated Hardui, the 24th November 1875. From-R. D. LOGG, Esq., Civil Surgeon of Hardui. To-The Sanitary Commissioner of Oudh. WITH reference to your No. 2812, dated 6th November 1875, forwarding copy of a letter from the Junior Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Oudh, on the subject of leprosy, and in continuation of this Office No. 87, dated 12th May 1875, I have the honour to offer the following further information regarding the same, derived from three lepers, inmates of the Poor-house at Hardui. 2. The first case, Munnooa, male, aged 35 years, caste Chamar, a native of Koundah, in the Hardui District, who is suffering from tubercular leprosy of the upper and lower extremities, gives the following account of himself: That the disease commenced about six years ago, with fissures in the soles of his feet; never suffered from syphilis; is married, and has three children-two boys and a girl-aged, respectively, 14, 15 and 17, neither of whom, nor his wife, from whom he is separated since the disease commenced, has leprosy; only remembers one other member of his family who had the disease, viz., a male cousin on the father's side. Case second, Hoolas, male, aged 40 years, caste Kissan, a native of Mulbourtha in the Hardui District, who is suffering from leucoderma or white leprosy, says of himself that he first observed the disease 20 years ago; it first commenced with a small patch on the chest, and subsequently appeared on the lips, back, elbows, hands, knees and feet; no taint of syphilis, and no other leper in his family, as far as he knows, nor his village; says he is married, and, has two boys, aged, respectively, 10 and 14, but neither of the children nor the wife has the disease, although they lived together until within the last few years. The third case is a female named Dhurmia, aged 22 years, caste Kaharini, of village Gopanooen in the Hardui District. She is suffering from tubercular leprosy of the hands and feet of five years' standing. She states that she first observed the disease after the birth of a girl now six years old, the only child she has had. A twelve- month after its birth she noticed a burning sensation in the palms of the hands followed by ansthesia, subsequently the soles of the feet became affected in the same way; says she is married, but that she has been separated from her husband for the last five years; he has not got the disease, and the child, whom I saw myself is up to this free from it; neither her husband nor herself has had syphillis, and, as far as she can remember, no other member of her family has had leprosy, nor does she know of any other case in her village. 3. It will be observed from the above cases that, as far as the statements from the lips of the unfortunates themselves can be relied upon, there was no taint of syphilis in any of their cases; that there may have been heriditary predisposition
( 11 ) in the first case ; and that the children of leprous parents do not necessarily in every instance inherit the dreadful disease, although their parents may have been living and cohabiting together after the first appearance of the disease in either of them. 4. In conclusion, I would beg to remark that the three cases are residents of villages widely separated from each other, the village in which the first case lived is nearly surrounded by a large swamp. I have not seen the village myself in which the second case lived, but I know that Pergunnah Kutyaree, in which it is situated, is the most malarious part of the district in which fevers are very prevalent for nearly six months of the year. The last case lived in a large village, the remains of an old town, in which there is a good deal of fever every year, which I witnessed myself when I went through it last month, and distributed an ounce of quinine among the sufferers. Dated Sitapur, the 17th July 1875. From-The Civil Surgeon of Sitapur. To-The Sanitary Commissioner of Oudh. I HAVE the honour to forward the following information regarding the prevalence of leprosy in this district. Tabular Statement No. I. given below represents state of the disease existing, on the 8th June last in the institutions mentioned. Tabular Statement No. II. has only been recently received from the Police Office. Tabular Statement No. I. Institution. Number of inmates on  Number of lepers  8th June. among them. Jail 710 0 Poor-house 31 6 Native hospital 56 1 Of the six lepers in poor-house three are from the Punjab and one from North-Western Provinces, and only two are residents of this district. Prevalence of the disease in different towns of the district. Tabular Statement No. II. Names of towns. Population. Number of lepers in each. Lahurpur 10,989 5 Biswan 5,749 4 Bari 4,018 4 Mahowli 1,338 4 Sitapur, Thompsonganj and 7,177 34  Alumnaggar.   The proportion of lepers in population, judging from the first four towns above given, is only about 0.8 to 1,000. Judging from Sitapur and Thompsonganj it is nearly 5 per 1,000, but many of the lepers at present in Sitapur come from
( 12 ) other parts of the country, attracted to Sitapur in the hopes of living by alms and charity. There is nothing peculiar about the inhabitants of Sitapur and Thompsonganj as compared with those of the other towns above given. The drainage of Thomp- songanj is very good, that of Sitapur is not good, but it is not worse than that of many of the others. 2. The disease is in my opinion heriditary. It appears in different members of the same family and continues to appear in them and their decendants for generations. This cannot be accounted for by the fact that the habits of life and circumstances of the family are the same, as in many cases they are not so. In cases where the members of the family are separated when young, the girls marrying and removing to different parts of the country, and their circumstances and habits being different, the disease appears in them or in their offspring; such cases, and there are many such undoubted cases, prove the disease heriditary. 3. I do not believe that the disease is contagious in the ordinary sense of that term, or is "spread by contagion like syphilis". I have known of a case which would seem to favour the opinion that it is communicable thus. A girl in whose family there was no trace of the disease, marries a leper, and after some years the disease appears in herself, but this is scarcely what is meant by contagion ; at least we can understand the possibility of disease being thus propagated, and yet not being in the ordinary sense contagious. No. 620, dated Lucknow, the 19th April 1875. From-The Superintendent, Central and District Jails, Lucknow. To-The Sanitary Commissioner of Oudh. WITH reference to your No. 907, dated 15th instant, I have the honour to submit the following on the subject of leprosy. I. Prevalence of the disease in the Lucknow Central and District Jails. Institution. Number of inmates  on 18th April 1875. Number of lepers among them.    Lucknow Central Prison 1,743 9 Ditto District Jail 820 3 II. Mode of propagation of the disease.-I am of opinion that leprosy, like other constitutional diseases, as phthisis and gout, is inherited, and that no circum- stances of life generate it de novo. I do not think that it is communicable like syphilis and other contagious diseases. I am unable as yet to state the evidence on which the above opinions are based. Of 21 cases of leprosy, whose histories I have collected since 1871, two patients only acknowledged that the disease had existed in their families. In one case the father, and in the other a paternal uncle, had died of leprosy. No. 2281, dated Lucknow, the 17th November 1875. From-G. D. McREDDIE, Esq., Superintendent, Central Prison, Lucknow. To-The Sanitary Commissioner of Oudh. Junior Secretary to Chief Commissioner's No. 4931, dated 20th October 1875. Sanitary Commissioner's No. 2808, dated 6th November 1875. Superintendent, Central and District Jails, No. 620, dated 19th April 1875. WITH reference to the correspondence marginally noted, I have the honour to state that no further remarks can be made on the prevalence, cause and mode of propagation of leprosy, but I beg to forward a statement of six patients in the Central Prison under treatment with gurjun oil. Central Prison.-The treatment began with six patients (one of whom was released on the 2nd February 1875, on expiry of sentence). Subsequently up to
(13) 23rd September nine were added to the above number, making a total of fourteen on the latter date. Of this number the six, whose cases are appended, have been benefited by the treatment, four have as yet derived no benefit, and four have only recently been admitted for treatment, and their cases shall be reported on hereafter. Lucknow District Jail.-In the District Jail there are five cases under treat- ment; but as they also have been recently admitted, they shall be included in a future report. I believe that gurjun oil has given more encouraging result than any other remedy, and that it is deserving of a further trial. CASE No. 1. Prisoner Bhagoo, No. 3316, aged 27 years, Passee, duration of disease four years, said not to be inherited, but says that an elder brother had the disease. Objective symptoms at beginning of treatment.-Has dark patches on inner side of thighs and right side of back; has also numerous light-coloured patches on trunk and upper limbs, not raised above general surface: general appearance of skin scurfy; no tubercles. Subjective symptoms.-Loss of sensation in the dark patches noticed above on inner aspect of thighs, in right side of back and in two places on outerside of arms; sense of tingling in hands and feet. Treatment with gurjun oil begun on 6th September 1874, and continued to 4th October 1874, when the supply of oil was exhausted. Treatment was resumed on 5th February 1875, and is still continued. Condition of patient on 15th November 1875.-Loss of sensation confined now to two places-to a place three inches in diameter on inner side of left thigh and to another seven inches in diameter on right side of back. General aspect of skin more natural. Tingling of hands and feet said to be less than before. CASE No. 2. Prisoner Ouseree, No. 3466, aged 40 years, Passee, duration of disease two months, said not to be inherited.

Subjective symptoms.-Objects appear indistinct to left eye. Loss of sensation in affected parts noticed above; has a burning sensation in left thumb, though the part has lost common sensation, being insensible to a puncture with the sharp point of a probe. Period under treatment same as No. 1. Condition of patient on 15th November 1875.-The affected parts have sunk to their natural level and assimilate more in colour to the rest of the skin; they are, however, still without sensation, except the small patch on back to which sensation has returned. CASE No. 3. Prisoner Ullun, No. 1902, aged 45 years, Mussulman, duration of disease 31/2 years, said not to be inherited. Objective symptoms at beginning of treatment.-Dark brown patches all over limbs, especially marked on outer aspect of forearms; general appearance of skin scaly and rough; these characteristics are most marked in limbs; no tubercles.

( 16 ) No. 164, dated Unao, the 1st June 1875. From-The Civil Medical Officer, Unao. To-The Sanitary Commissioner of Oudh. WITH reference to letter No. 1734, I beg to state that the delay in submitting the report on leprosy is owing to the absence of any record on the subject in this Office. The police was asked to make enquiries in the different thannahs about the disease. They have sent in a report only a day ago. I hope to submit the report in course of the week. Dated Unao, the 18th July 1875. From-The Health Officer, Unao. T-The Sanitary Commissioner of Oudh. WITH reference to No. 895, dated 15th April, I beg to submit the following report : 1. The prevalence of the disease in this district, as could be judged from the number of lepers present on any one date in the jail and Native hospital, is the following : Institution.   Number of inmates on 17th April 1875 (strength of prisoners 334). Number of lepers among them.   Jail  Poor Hospital  Native Hospital 10(sick)  ...           70         1  ...  4 2. I also append here a list of lepers as distributed in the different thannahs of the district furnished by the police. I think the cases of leucoderma as included in the list. The largest number is 125 in the thannah of Achulgunge to a population of 75,899, while the smallest number is 17 in the thannah of Barra to a population of 98,364. The total number in the whole district is 650 to a population of 944,793, that is .06 per hundred of the population : according to sex, 555 male to 95 female. The ratio of male to female pepulation is 1 male to 2.08 female. The largest number of cases in the whole district is between the ages of 20 to 40. 3.I am unable to state the peculiarity of the thannah of Achulgunge as I had not an opportunity of visiting it. 4.It would appear from the information given in the accompanying list that the largest number, i.e., 262 out of 650, has an ostensible means of living; and as the class of cultivators are not every badly off, I think that they are not in want of food and small comforts of life. Out of 650,262 is employed in cultivation, while the rest are unfit for work and are either dependent on their families or life by begging. Out of 650 given in the list only 27 are beggars. Their present cir- cumstance is rather due to the disease. 5.I cannot give my opinion as to the propagation of the disease from my experience of the district. 6.I beg to state the facts which I have come to know from my own obser- vation in other places. I know instances in which the disease is decidedly hereditary,
(17) and one family, which is at present in my mind, in which the disease has appeared only among the sons at certain age. 7. With regard to its contagiousness, I have not sufficient facts to form my opinion. I think that in the ulcerated stage of the tubercular form the disease is contagious. 8. Fish diet is commonly supposed to give rise to leprosy, but I have not sufficient experience to form decided opinion on the subject. 5a

I HAVE the honour to make the following observations on the  gurjun oil  plan of treatment for leprosy. 2.    Although  the   number   of cases   regularly  and  systematically   treated according to this new method, under my immediate supervision, is up   to   this  date exceedingly small, yet I am inclined to believe  that it deserves a further and a more extended trial.    I leave out of my  calculation those cases which  have  been   treated in the  out-door  dispensaries  of the  hospitals  under nay  superintendence,   for it is  almost  impossible  to   observe  with    accuracy  the  progress  towards  recovery or otherwise of such cases on account of the irregularity of attendance  on the  part of the patients, as well as  the  several  other conditions  which are likely to modify the treatment and render any conclusions therefrom fallacious. 3.    Early in the month  of April last  a leper  asylum  on a limited scale was opened in connection with the City Poor-house,  and arrangements for the accommo- dation of eight patients.    The Hospital Assistant in charge of the lock hospital was appointed to take medical charge, medicines were supplied from the King's Hospital, and the institution was placed  under  my   superintendence.    I beg to annex here- with a statement shewing  the  number   and nature of the cases treated during  the last 11 months, from which  it will  appear that, although no  marked  benefit has been observed in any, yet  the arrest  of the progress  of the  disease in  six out  of the seven cases is remarkable.    It is also a   singular  fact worthy of notice that none of the Cases was of hereditary origin. 4.    The medicine was administered both  internally  and  externally  exactly in accordance with the directions given in Dr.   Dougall's pamphlet on the subject. 5.    The patients hitherto  treated  have been  almost, without  exception,  all poor and destitute, who, before their admission  into  the asylum,  used  to  live  by begging.    It therefore becomes a  matter   of question how much of the   benefit is to be ascribed to comfortable living and a  nourishing diet and  how much   to the use of the remedy.

THE proportion of hereditary to acquired cases of leprosy, as observed amongst the inmates of the Poor-house Leper Asylum, is 1 in 9. It must be borne in mind, however, that it is extremely difficult to get a true history of the cases from such ignorant people. Incipient disease is almost always overlooked, and unless the disease is fully developed and the symptoms become distressing, it is not likely to attract their notice. 2. No source of contagion can be traced in any of the cases at present under treatment, nor can it be acccurately made out under what circumstances the disease first made its appearance. In a few cases the pre-existence of syphilis may fairly be assumed. 3. There is at present in the asylum a leper who has been living with his wife for a long time without in any way affecting her. Their offspring, an infant, a few months old, is to all appearance healthy, though congenitally blind. 4. One of the lepers has got two children ; their health, according to his state- ment, is good, and they are perfectly free from the disease, though considerably grown up. One of them was, however, born prior to his being affected with the disease. 5. The age at which the disease first appeared is between 30 and 40 years. 6. In one case of hereditary origin the disease was traced to the father, the patient being a male. 7. There appears to be no peculiarity in the climate, &c., of the places in which the lepers were born, nor any endemic influence to predispose them to disease. Dated Lucknow, the 1st July 1876.

To-The Sanitary Commissioner of Oudh. IN reply to your No. 896, dated the 15th ultimo, I have the honour to forward the following information on the subject of leprosy. 2. The disease is met with in this district, but does not exist to any great extent. The following table shews the number of lepers in the sadr and two of the principal towns in the district.

?( 23 ) No. 93, dated Bara Banki, the 21st June 1876. From-The Health Officer of Bara Banki. To-The Sanitary Commissioner of Oudh. WITH reference to your No. 579 of 16th March, and subsequent reminders, I have the honour to state that the investigation into the effects of treatment of leprosy by gurjun oil came to an end on the 1st March in consequence of the supply of oil having run out, and a fresh supply not having been sanctioned by the Deputy Surgeon General. 2. On examining the case book I find records of thirteen cases of which eight were relieved and five cured by this treatment. All the eight cases relieved were under treatment when the supply of the medicines failed, and might, therefore, have been cured had it been persevered in. 3.The improvement seemed to consist in a  diminution of all the promi- nent symptoms and a favourable change in the general health. All the patients are recorded as having grown fatter under the treatment. 4. I was informed by Dr. Cannon that certain stations, of which Bara Banki was not one, had been selected for the further prosecution of the enquiry, and that it was on this account that a fresh supply of oil was disallowed. No. 88, dated Rai Bareli, the 11th May 1875. From-Surgeon Major C. CAMERON, Health Officer and Civil Surgeon of Rai Bareli. To-The Sanitary Commissioner of Oudh. IN attention to your letter No. 903, dated the 15th ultimo, I have the honour to give the following information on the subject of leprosy in the Rai Bareli District : I.-Prevalence of the disease.    Institution. Number of inmates on any date (22nd ultimo). Number of lepers among them. Jail        678 1 Dispensary and Poor-house  40 1 Police    454 1 Four outlying cholera-infected villages were recently visited by me, and in an aggregate population therein of about 2,150 I could only find three cases of leprosy. From general observation extending over some years I should say that the rates of prevalence of both forms of the disease amongst the population is approximately as follows : Ratio with the tuberculated form of leprosy, 020 per mille. Ratio with the non-tuberculated form of leprosy, 130 per mille. II.-Special prevalence of the disease in any locality. III.-Peculiarities, if any, of such locality as to soil, drainage, &c. As there is no exceptional prevalence of the disease in any locality, peculiarities of soil, drainage, &c., in such cannot be given. IV.-Peculiarities of the inhabitants as to circumstances of life, caste, food, employment, &c. None of these appears to influence the development of leprosy. Non-tuber- culated leprosy has often been observed to commence in persons of high castes in the enjoyment of ease, plenty and great bodily strength. The lower and poorer castes are not exempt from this form of the disease, but are vastly more subject to the tuberculated form of leprosy. V.-Mode of propagation of the disease.
?(24) (1.) Tuberculated leprosy is a constitutional and inherited disease. Several of the cases at the dispensary have been the children of lepers. Others have denied that their fathers and mothers were affected, but professed ignorance of the ailments of grandparents and individuals of collateral branches of their families. The non-tuberculated form of leprosy may be due to a degree of inherited taint slighter than in the tuberculated form. (2.) No fact in support of the theory that leprosy is spread by contagion like syphilis has come to my knowledge, and the case of an applicant at the dis- pensary goes a certain way against it. This case was that of a woman with two leprous children, aged about five and nine years, the offspring of a leprous father. The mother was in perfect health and without a symptom of taint of the disease. (3.) From information given under heading IV. it is improbable that leprosy arises from special circumstances of life, such as diet, &c. No. 155, dated Rai Bareli, the 19th June 1876. From-The Health Officer of Rai Bareli. To-The Sanitary Commissioner of Oudh. IN compliance with your circular memorandum No. 2818, dated 6th November 1875, I have the honour to submit the following information on the subject of leprosy in this district as an addition to the report forwarded to you on the 11th May 1875. 2. True leprosy or elephantiasis grcorum is met with in this district and may be said to be endemic. It has been known from the earliest times, but no date can be given of its first appearance. The Natives recognise two forms-the tubercular and the ansthetic,-but they also look upon leucoderma as a true leprosy. The disease is not specially prevalent in any one part of the district, and, so far as I can learn, is neither on the increase nor the decrease. 3. Endeavours have been made to obtain some reliable information as to the prevalence of leprosy, and the Tahsildars and police have been applied to for any information they could give. The former simply replied that the disease was not prevalent in their jurisdiction, but the latter have furnished a list of villages where there are three or more lepers. There are 29 such villages with an aggregate number of 144 lepers, of whom 39 had the tubercular and 105 the ansthetic form of the disease. The largest number in any one village was that of Koonsa, which numbered sixteen (three being tubercular and thirteen ansthetic). 4. There is not any satisfactory evidence as to the manner in which leprosy is propagated, whether by intermarriage, cohabitation, hereditary tendency, or whether it is produced by external causes. The cases are so scattered, and the evidence obtained from the afflicted is so contradictory, that no deductions of any value can be drawn from it. 5. Since March 1875 there have been only five cases admitted to the dispensary and poor-house; they have been treated with gurjun oil as prescribed by Dr. Dougall of Port Blair. Lepers do not show any willingness to submit to the treatment for any length of time; they dislike being separated from their families, and object to give up begging, which they must do when admitted to the poor-house. Of the five cases treated four were of the ansthetic and one of tubercular variety; in all considerable improvement took place. CASE No. 1. Oomrao, Mussulman, Pathan, cultivator, aged 40 years, resident of Poorwa, Bhikhumpur, village Rustamow, Thannah Mohunganj, Rai Bareli District, a man of strong physical conformation, affected with non-tuberculated leprosy on 1st March 1875. Previous history.-His maternal grandfather was a leper. His father and mother had no symptoms of the disease. Has two sisters and one brother living, all healthy. Was attacked with malarious fever and dysentery at the age of twenty; but recovered health and strength in the course of a year. Has never been in want of the necessaries of life. Has not had syphilis. About two years ago circular skin spots 31/2 inches in diameter commenced, and have since continued at intervals to appear on the extremities and trunk. These were not preceded by
?(25) general indisposition. For the first six months the spots were red and tingling, and they afterwards became white, hairless and insensible to touch, but not to pain; the cuticle over the spots also became wrinkled and dry. Present symptoms, 1st March 1875.-Skin spots of the size and characters mentioned in the previous history exist on the trunk and extremities. Those on the hands and legs are hairless. Both ears and a spot on the forehead are red and ansthetic. The lower extremities are slightly swollen and feel heavy, but preserve their symmetry. Touch sensation absent below the knees; soles of the feet dry and furrowed; no tubercles; no disease of internal organs; eats heartily; sleeps well; urine not albuminous. Put on gurjun oil treatment on 1st March 1875. On the 1st July 1875 skin spots on upper and lower extremities of natural colour, sensible to the touch, and covered with hair; urine non-albuminous. On the 28th September 1875 this man returned to his home. The swelling and feeling of heaviness in both lower extremities had gone; the ears, legs and skin of the forehead had regained normal appearance and sensation, and his general health had much improved. CASE No. 2. SOOKNIDHAN, caste Koree, aged 32 years, inhabitant of village Sumna Bhir, Sultanpur District, of good bodily development, with non-tuberculated leprosy, applied for treatment at the Rai Bareli Dispensary on the 1st June 1875. Previous history.-No history of hereditary taint; never had syphilis. Has a younger brother, a wife and two sons, all healthy. Says he was all right till about three years ago, when small patches of discolouration appeared all over the trunk and extremities. The patches were not insensible to touch. About six months ago swelling and ansthesia of the extremities commenced, preceded by a sensation of tingling. Present symptoms.-Skin universally rough and brownish; circular discoloured patches here and there over the body, they are more numerous on the back. These patches retain sensation, but have no hairs. Swelling, heaviness and ansthesia of legs, outer aspects of thighs and of upper extremities up to elbows. No other part of the body insensible to touch. Dorsum of hands slightly atrophied, presenting shallowness with prominence of the extensor tendons. Fingers slightly unequal in symmetry, nails healthy; nails of toes horny and rough; soles of feet smooth and not cracked; a white cicatrix of a burn over innerside of left ankle-joint; a small round ulcer over dorsum of left foot at the second and third metatarsal bones, the result of a thorn piercing through the part; no tubercles anywhere. Appetite good; sleeps well at night. No albumen in urine. Internal organs healthy. Put on gurjun oil treatment on 1st June 1875. 1st August.-Swelling, heaviness and ansthesia of right upper and lower extremities gone; ulcer on dorsum of left foot healed; general health improved; urine non-albuminous. Continue treatment. 1st April 1876.-All ulcers healed, and there is not any ansthesia. The man is in good condition and increased in weight; wishes to go home. 17th April 1876.-Discharged from hospital this day. CASE NO. 3. BHUGWAN DASS, Hindu, aged 33 years, inhabitant of village Burrola Sindwa, Sialkot District, a man of athletic proportions, with non-tuberculated leprosy, applied for treatment on the 1st March 1875. Previous history.-Has been five years at Rai Bareli. No history of hereditary taint. Had a venereal sore twelve years ago, no secondary symptoms. Has never been ailing otherwise. Three months ago vesicles began to form on left hand on dorsal aspect of integumental fold, between thumb and index finger, these burst and formed shallow ulcers, at the same time the hand became heavy, enlarged uni- formly and ansthetic. The right hand was similarly affected soon afterwards. Present symptoms.-Both hands uniformly swollen and without touch sensa- tion. Two shallow ulcers, circular in out-line and about an inch in diameter, on dorsum of each hand, over integument between metacarfal bones of thumbs and index fingers. The floors of the ulcers are formed of healthy granulations; toes swollen and ansthetic; soles of the feet dry and deeply fissured; has one large 7a
( 26 ) scurfy-elevated pale skin spot of herpes circiuratus over left shoulder-blade ; urine non-albuminous. Eats and sleeps well. Put on gurjun oil treatment on 1st March 1875. On the 14th of June 1875, when this man went to his home, swelling of the hands and toes had gone, and sensation had returned to these parts. The ulcers had healed. CASE No. 4. BHUGGUN, Passee, aged 40 years, chowkidar, resident of village Tillokepur, Zila Bara Banki, a man in good condition of body, with non-tuberculated leprosy, applied for treatment on 1st June 1875. Previous history.-Father and mother died at advanced ages. One brother living and one sister, both with families, and all healthy. Has a wife and five children, none of them ailing. Has not had syphilis or disease of any description. About six months ago his hands and feet began to swell, tingle and feel heavy. Simultaneously pale and itchy skin spots began to appear over the trunk and extremities. The swelling of the hands and feet extended up the forearms and legs, and these parts became insensible to touch. Present symptoms, 1st June 1875.-The skin spots over the body and the swelling and loss of touch sensation of legs and forearms continue ; no tubercles ; eats and sleeps well; urine albuminous. Put on gurjun oil treatment on 1st June 1875. 1st August 1875.-Itchy skin spots over trunk and extremities continue. Swell- ing of right upper and lower extremities gone, and sensation of the parts restored. Swelling and ansthesia of left lower extremities much less. General health good ; urine non-albuminous. CASE No. 5. BINDAH, Khuttick, aged fifteen years, inhabitant of Rai Bareli, a lad of spare habit of body, with tuberculated leprosy, applied for treatment on 1st March 1875. Previous history.-His maternal grandfather had leprosy and died of the disease. Father and mother died of cholera. Is living with an uncle. Has no brothers or sisters. States that he has had leprosy for four years. The disease com- menced with the appearance of large pale scurfy skin spots over the trunk and extremities, which lost touch sensation. Three years ago tubercles developed in skin of face, ears and fingers. Has not had syphilis. Present symptoms.-Toes and fingers hypertrophied. Nails shrivelled, dry and irregularly broken. A large patch of discolouration with ansthesia over both nates and another over the back. Tubercles on al nasi, lower lip, eye-brows, ears and cheeks, all the size of olives; skin universally rough and dry; scalp almost devoid of hair and scaly ; no ulceration anywhere ; loss of touch sensation in hands and forearms and in feet and legs. General health fair. Put on gurjun oil treat- ment on 1st March 1875. 1st May 1875.-Patches of discolouration over nates and back have regained colour, but not sensation ; tubercles unaffected. 1st August 1875.-Tubercles of face and ears reduced considerably in size and number; sensibility has returned in forearms and feet and legs; loss of touch sensation in hands and over nates and back remains. 1st June 1876.-Tubercles on face diminished in size; sensation has returned everywhere but to forearms and legs from knee downwards. In conclusion, I may remark that the internal administration of the gurjun oil had frequently to be suspended on account of its laxative effects. Dated Partabgarh, the 29th April 1875. From-J. HART, Esq., M. R. C. S., Civil Surgeon and Health Officer of Partabgarh. To-The Sanitary Commissioner of Oudh. IN reply to your letter No. 905 of the 15th instant, I have the honour to state, with reference to the 1st paragraph, that on the 17th instant there were sixteen sick in the jail, and 50 in the charitable dispensary, but there was not a leper among them.

WITH reference to your memorandum No. 588 of the 16th March, calling for a further report on leprosy, I have the honour to state that 21 cases applied to the charitable dispensary here for treatment during the year 1875, and the result is not known in any of the cases, as there was no accommodation available for lepers, and the patients ceased to attend. No. 135, dated Sultanpur, the 21st July 1875. From-A. CAMERON, Esq., M. D., Health Officer of Sultanpur. To-The Sanitary Commissioner of Oudh. IN reply to your No. 904 of the 15th April last, I have the honour to furnish the following information regarding leprosy in this district. 1. As suggested in your letter, I give in a tabular form the number of lepers in the three following institutions : Institution. Number of inmates on Number of lepers  the 20th July among them.  1875.  Jail 493 None. Poor-house  54 7 Native Hospital 72 4 These figures give little information regarding the prevalence of the disease in the district generally. It so happens that there is no leprous prisoner in the jail at present. A few months ago, however, there were two, and in my experience it is a rare thing for this jail not to number at least one leper amongst its inmates. The proportion of lepers among the inmates of the poor-house is of course much larger than among the general population, as victims of the disease are among the commonest object of charity. The proportion of leprous patients at the dispensary is, I need not say, equally fallacious as an indication of the general prevalence of the disease. It is impossible to say what this latter is as there are no data to go upon.
( 28 ) 2. The following statement shows the number of inhabitants in four villages in different parts of the district and the number of lepers among them. The information has been obtained through the Tahsildars after considerable delay, and I canot say how far it may be depended on : Village. Population. Number of lepers. Haliapur    ...  ...  ... 3,026 4 Hassunpur   ...  ...  ... 4,399 1 Barousa     ...  ...  ... 1,333 None. Tirsoolie   ...  ...  ...  1,262 do. The Deputy Commissioner, in a communication received from him on the subject, states that there is no locality where the disease is more prevalent than another, and this agrees with my own experience in the matter. It appears to be pretty equally distributed over the district. 3. The disease appears to affect all castes, but it is much more common amongst the lower than higher. I have never been able to ascertain any peculiarity in the circumstances of life of those affected with leprosy satisfactorily accounting for the disease: 4. The general impression appears to be that the disease is hereditary, and I am of opinion it is so in many cases. It is difficult to get trustworthy information on this point, as lepers are reluctant to confess that their disease is a family one. Of ten lepers, whose history I have inquired into lately, two were ascertained to have leprous relations,-the father of one and two uncles of the other had the disease. I have also heard from a trustworthy informant of two families, not many miles from this station, where several members of each have had the disease,-in one instance a mother and her son and two brothers, and in the other a father and his son and a brother. 5. I have met with no evidence to show that leprosy is spread by contagion like syphilis. In none of the cases that I have inquired into has a leper infected his wife, and when the children do show the disease, which in my experience is seldom, it is not till some years after birth. The people seem to have an idea that the disease may be contracted by close and constant communication with a leper, but I have known but one doubtful in- stance where the disease may have been so acquired. It was the case of a boy of about eight years of age, whose father became affected with leprosy about four years before. The mother and other two children deserted the father, but the boy remained with him. In about a year after the boy became leprous, the mother and the other children remaning till now unaffected. Of course this may have been a case of hereditary leprosy, or the same causes may have given rise to the disease in the boy as produced it in the father. The case well illustrates the very great difficulty there is in forming a decided opinion regarding the origin of the disease. In the absence of satisfactory evidence of hereditray transmission or contagion in such a large proportion of cases, I cannot resist the conclusion that the disease often arises independently of either. What the special circumstances of life are which favour the development of the disease I cannot say. Memorandum No. 88, dated Sultanpur, the 11th April 1876.

IN reply to No. 1498, dated 17th instant, is directed to forward a copy of the report No. 2, dated 11th January 1875, of the Civil Surgeon, Gonda, regarding the endemic skin diseases of India. A. MURRAY, Junior Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Oudh. To the Sanitary Commissioner of Oudh. Report by P. J. HEFFERNAN, Esq., Civil Surgeon of Gonda, THE skin diseases most frequently found in this district are leprosy, psoriasis, pythriasis and lichen. In the Government Poor-house are some lepers with the disease in an advanced stage. The disease seems to be of a sporadic nature, and can scarcely be said to be endemic to this district. The Natives recognise but one form, the ansthetic, by which the disease is ushered in accompanied by fever, after repeated attacks of which the disease is said to progress rapidly. Relatives are said to be free from it, and in some instances the offsprings of lepers have not contracted the disease. There is no evidence to show that it has been produced by fish or dhall eating, as it is to be found in those who have not used those articles of diet. Low caste Hindus-Ahirs and Korees-are those generally affected, the cheaper kinds of grain, such as bajra and joar, being their principal food. The soil of the district is extensively cultivated, and the grain of good quality. Fever is extremely prevalent after rains and during cold weather; the mortality from it is very high. Pythriasis is also a common disease, it is recognised by circular discolour- ation of the skin, sometimes in small and sometimes in large patches, often attended by itching and giving off scales when scratched. In severe forms it is frequently surrounded by red rings, those rings often extend rapidly when the centre light-coloured portion is found to extend its area; when the disease has terminated there will generally be found destruction of some pigment. 8a
( 30 ) Lichen tiapicus is to be found amongst both Europeans and Natives ; it is recognised by a number of red vascular papules studded over different parts of the body accompanied with intolerable itching. The cause of it is due to failure of the ludarifarous glands in not relieving the skin of the superabundant sweat. It is considered to be a healthy sign, shewing that nature is trying to get rid of some noxious or abundant fluid from the body. No. 95, dated Bahraich, the 5th June 1875. From-The Offg.

From-The Offg. Civil Surgeon of Bahraich. To-The Sanitary Commissioner of Oudh. IN accordance with your memorandunm No. 585, dated 16th instant, I have the honour to submit a brief report on reprosy in this district. A report on the treatment of leprosy by gurjun oil was sent to the Deputy Surgeon General early in January last. The present report is necessarily very meagre, as the information required by Messrs. Fox and Farquhar can be given only after long and careful study of the disease, especially as facts, and not opinions, are required. Report by the Officiating Civil Surgeon of Bahraich on leprosy in Bahraich,-dated the 22nd March 1876. A.-LEPROSY IN DISTRICTS. 1. Bahraich in the North-East of Oudh, South to Nepal. 2. The district is in land. 3. Yes. 4. The disease is not an importation, so far as I can discover, but is either pro- duced or propagated in Bahraich. It is not merely sporadic. I cannot say how many forms the Natives recognise. 5. Malarial. 6. I cannot answer this question.
?(   31   ) 7.    Out of 62 patients 41 were Mussalmans and 21 Hindus.    I have not seen the disease in a European. 8.    The  diet  consists principally  of grain, such as kod, merows, coarse rice, jor,  sawan,   labrarh  with   the   cheap   dals, masoor,  meea,   msh   kras,   and urhur.    Wheat, moong dl with a little fish and meat are eaten by the well-to-do. 9.    Out  of an  area of 1,755,144 acres,  763,678 acres are now under cultiva- tion.    The grain used is obtained in the district.    None of the grain used is grown on uncultivated land. 10.    The cultivation of the district has increased by about 150,000 acres since the settlement.    The use of fresh vegetables has also been introduced.    There  are at present 1,300 acres sown with vegetables. I cannot say whether leprosy has increased of late. 11.    I can adduce no such facts. 12.    The Natives consider leucoderma and albinesm as akin to leprosy. B.-LEPROSY IN INDIVIDUALS. 1.    Out   of   62   patients  seven acknowledge   that   their   fathers   had   the disease,  and  one  that his grandfather was a leper.   Two  of the   62 are related to  each other, and  there  are  three  albinoes in the  same  family.     These   five individuals belong to a bradari   (brotherhood)   of 22 houses   or  families.    They are of   the   Bunneea   caste.     They   never    marry    out  of   their   own   bradari. One of the present three albinoes had  a  nephew, who  was an albino, but he is dead.    Taking the two lepers who are related to each other as   cases   of hereditary taint, there   are    altogether  ten  propagated  cases  out of   62.     The remaining fifty-two  cases  are  presumably   produced.    The  proportion,   therefore,   is  about as one to six. 2.    The answer to this is involved in the last. 3.    All the lepers I have seen have occasionally suffered from  fever, but  none can say that they suffered in a marked manner from  malarial  fever  prior   to being attacked with leprosy.    I have never heard a leper attribute  his  disease  to   prior attacks of fever. No. 99, dated Gonda, the 21st June 1876. From-The Civil Medical Officer of Gonda. To-The Sanitary Commissioner of Oudh. IN connection with your No. 584 of the 16th March 1876, referring to No. 4913 of the Junior Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, Oudh, dated 20th October 1875, I have the honour to submit the following remarks concerning leprosy in the town of Gonda. Having assumed charge here on the 10th April last, I have had no opportunity yet of enquiring into the prevalence of the disease in the district generally. 2.    The population of the town of Gonda is 11,600, and there are  at  present fourteen lepers resident,  all are  over thirty years of age, ten of them are males, eight are Muhammadans, twelve are married, and six of these have children; in no instance has the disease been communicated by the  husband to  the  wife,  or  vice versa,  or   by either to the children.    All these persons state that there is no family history of the disease.    The average duration of the disease for  the  entire number is nine years.    They are all in poor circumstances.    Excepting three, they all con- tracted the disease while living in Gonda  Khas.    There  is no  history of syphilis amongst them.    The  earliest  age  at  which the   disease    commenced   was    23 years,  a male  Hindu, unmarried;    the   latest  age    46   years,   a  male   Hindu, married.    The ansthetic variety of the disease is more common than the tubercular. 3.    Besides the cases mentioned  above  there are five lepers  in  the  Gonda Poor-house : (1) Salar Rain, Muhammadan, aged 50 years, resident of Gonda District. Duration of disease eight years; comes of a healthy family, is married and has had twelve children, of whom nine are living and are
?(  32  ) healthy ; two were born after he had contracted the disease, and have remained free from leprosy taint up to the present ; his wife is alive and healthy. (2) Bhojalai, Ahir, aged 50 years, from the Fyzabad District. Duration of the disease twelve years ; no history of the disease in his family, but there were other lepers in his village ; is married, has had nine children, one of whom was born after the disease was contracted ; six, including this one, died at early ages, the others are healthy. (3) Husen Baksh, Muhammadan, aged 45 years, from District Banda, North-Western Provinces. Duration of disease sixteen years ; no family history of disease ; is unmarried, but cohabits with No. 4, by whom he has had two sons, both died in early infancy. (4) Mussamat Ramozi, Mussulmani, aged 36 years, resident of Gonda District. Duration of the disease six years ; her father and two brothers were lepers ; is married, but was rejected by her husband when the disease manifested itself, and is now living with No. 3. (5) Nanku, Hindu, aged 40 years, from Jaunpur. Duration of the disease nine years ; comes of a healthy family ; is married, and has had four children, three of whom are alive and healthy, and one of these was born after the disease was contracted ; had syphilis badly about twelve years ago. 4. Assistant Surgeon Jadub Kristo Sen, in charge of the Sadr Dispensary, used gurjun oil last year in the treatment of some cases of leprosy internally and externally ; as an application it proved very efficacious, but he was not encour- aged to continue internal administration as the patients complained of " burning pain in the stomach, itching sensation in the throat with loss of appetite, diarrha and nausea."

WITH reference to your No. 900 of 15th April 1875, I have the honour to state as follows. 2. The subjoined form shows the number of lepers among the inmates of the jail and charitable dispensary : there is no poor-house, only an asylum for blind and lepers, the statistics of which are obviously useless for the purpose of this inquiry. Institution. Number of inmates Number of lepers  Percentage.   on any day. among them.  Jail 855 3 035 Poor-house None. None. None. Native Hospital 93 2 215 3. The following table gives the number of inhabitants and of lepers in ten villages taken from different parts of the district in the vicinity of the branch dis- pensaries. I am afraid that there is very little to be learnt from these figures, the number of lepers being so small everywhere that a difference of one or two alters the percentage considerably. There is, however, a perceptible difference in the
?(  33  ) percentage of lepers near Shahganj Dispensary, as compared with the other two localities the percentage is distinctly higher. Districts. Name of villages.

I could find no peculiarities in these villages as to water, soil, drainage, &c., with this exception, that the soil of the villages near Shahganj was clayey, while that of those about Tandah and Akberpur was on the whole sandy. One of the villages near Shahganj is noted for fever, and I am inclined to suspect the other two also. 5. There was nothing worthy of notice in the circumstances, caste, food or employment of the inhabitants of the villages chosen for examination ; the people resembled in all essential respects those of other villages in the district. 6. With regard to the mode of propagation I have no evidence to offer, but my opinion is-1st, that the disease is hereditary ; 2nd, that it is not contagious ; 3rd, that it often arises like other constitutional diseases without hereditary predisposition ; but I have come to no conclusion as to what the circumstances are which produce it, though I am inclined to suspect malaria as one of them.

Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department. WITH reference to paragraph 8 of the Resolution of the Govern- ment of India, Home Department, No. 1-136, dated 5th March 1875, I am directed to forward the enclosed report by the Sanitary Commis- sioner, Central Provinces, regarding causation and distribution of leprosy in these Provinces. No. 1110, dated Nagpur, the 11th November 1876. From-Surgeon-Major S. C. TOWNSEND, Sanitary Commissioner, Central Provinces. To-The Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces. REFERRING to the Resolution of Government in the Home Department No. 1-136, dated 5th March 1875, forwarded under your endorsement No. 1070-43, dated 27th idem, I have now the honour to submit a concise summary of the information with respect to the causation and distribution of leprosy furnished to this Office by the Civil Surgeons of the different districts, as directed in the Chief Commissioner's circular No. 12, dated 12th April 1875. The following figures, showing the number of lepers in the different Provinces, have been extracted from the census reports of 1872. It is not probable that these figures represent correctly the actual number of lepers in the different Provinces-in fact, subsequent enquiries in many districts of these Provinces have shown that the number of lepers enumerated in the census was far below the truth, but it may, I think, be assumed that similar errors of enumeration occurred in the other Provinces, and that the figures given fairly represent the comparative prevalence of leprosy in different parts of India :  Number of lepers. Ratio per 100,000   of population. Bombay 18,856 71 Oudh 7,831 69 Berar 1,432 65 Bengal 38,129 63 Punjab 10,989 62 Madras 13,944 45 North-Western Provinces 10,099 32 Central Provinces 2,807 30 These figures would show that leprosy is comparatively little prevalent in these Provinces, but the truth is that it is very unequally distributed, being very prevalent in some parts of the Province, almost absent from others. From enquiries instituted in accordance with the instructions issued last year, it would appear that the greatest number of lepers are found in the districts South and East of the Satpuras and in Nimar. In Raipur Dr. Trimnell estimates that there are about 1,000 lepers, or 120 in every 100,000 of the population. In Betul there are 734, in Bhandara 740 lepers, or 150 and 130 in every 100,000 of the population. In Nimar the census statements enumerate 194 lepers, or 90 in every 100,000 of population. On the other hand, the Civil Surgeons of all the districts of the Satpuras report that the number of cases that come under their notice is very few. In Mandla only six cases had come under observation, and all of the sufferers were pilgrims passing through the place to or from Jagganath. The Civil Surgeon, Chindwara, reports that leprosy exists to a very small extent in his district, and that in the course of his frequent tours on vaccination work he has met with very few sufferers. He gives the details of ten cases which have come
?(  2  ) under treatment; of those one was a Muhammadan and the rest were Hindus ; none belonged to the Gonds, who form the majority of the population of the district. The Civil Surgeon of Seoni reports that twelve cases only have come under treatment, and that in the course of his tours in the district he met with only two other lepers ; of the twelve lepers whose histories were enquired into, only seven were found to belong to the district, whether any of these belonged to the Gonds or other aboriginal tribes the report does not say. In the Balaght District there are reported to be 129 lepers, but they are found chiefly among the Hindu population of the villages below the Ghts. In the districts of the Narbada Valley, North of the Satpuras, leprosy is more prevalent than in the hill district, but the numbers are not so great as in the districts South of the range. In the District of Jubbulpore the disease is said not to prevail to any extent, but 42 were collected for treatment with gurjun oil. In the Narsinghpur district there are 158 lepers, and in Hoshangabad 136 were enumerated, the proportion of the population affected to these two districts of the Narbada Valley being 46 and 36, respectively, in every 100,000. Of the Vindyan Districts a list of 160 lepers, or 32 per 100,000, is returned from Saugor, while in Damoh the number appears to be extremely small, only seven were enumerated at the census, and the Civil Surgeon states that two only have come under his observation. The general result of the enquiry in respect of the distribution of leprosy in these Provinces is to show that the disease is prevalent in a comparatively high degree among the population of the districts South of the central range of hills ; the rates in these districts correspond very closely with the rates of prevalence in the Deccan Districts of Bombay. Among the population of the hill districts, of which a large proportion belongs to the aboriginal tribes, leprosy is very little known, while among the population, chiefly Hindus, that inhabit the Narbada Valley and Vindyan districts, the numbers are greater than among the population of the Satpuras, but far less than among the population of the Southern and Eastern districts. The rates of prevalence in the Northern districts of these Provinces are in fact similar to the rates that obtain in Southern districts of the North-Western Provinces. Lepers are found in the greatest numbers in the large centres of population, and especially in places resorted to by pilgrims. In Raipur the greatest numbers proportionately to population are found in the sadr town and at Rajim-a place to which pilgrims largely resort. In the town of Chanda, which has a population of 16,000, the number of lepers amounts to 60, or nearly 40 in every 10,000. In Nimar the largest numbers are found in the old town of Burhanpur and the adjoining villages. Of 160 lepers in the Saugor District, 41 were living in the sadr town which has a population of less than 40,000. With regard to the incidence of the disease on different classes of the popula- tion, the report of the late Dr. Aylen, Civil Surgeon of Bhandara, gives the most complete information, and of this the following table is a summary:  Population, Number of Ratio per Whole population.  lepers, 10,000,  564,813. 740 13. Muhammadans 10,696 22 20 Small traders and scribes or writers  24,230 48 19 Brahmins 5,989 9 15 Servants, &c., chiefly Dhers 106,927 163 15 Manufacturing castes, chiefly Dhimars and    weavers 42,719 60 14 Agriculturists 198,786 273 13 Mendicants 1,737 2 11 Pastoral castes (Gaolis)  40,462 44 10 Artizans 30,509 25 8 Aboriginal tribes (Gonds) 80,661 54 6 Hindus not included in the above classes  21,754 40 18
( 3 ) From these figures it would appear that Muhammadans suffer from leprosy in a comparatively high degree, and the same fact appears in the records of other dis- tricts. Of Hindus it is not the lowest castes or poorest classes that suffer most; small traders and writers, or persons of sedentary occupation, produce the greatest numbers. Then we find Brahmins, the highest caste, suffering in equal proportion with the menial class consisting chiefly of Dhers, who are out-castes. The agricultural class suffers somewhat less than the menial class, but the diminution is greater among the cowherds; the artizans are still lower in the scale, but the Gonds occupy the lowest portion. In respect of the Gonds, the statistics of the Bhandara District confirm the evidence furnished from the hill districts. The people belonging to the aboriginal tribes, who have become naturalized among the population of the plain country, do not remain exempt from the disease, but the race is not affected by it to the same extent as the castes of Hindu orgin. In all districts in which any considerable numbers of lepers are found, the number of males affected preponderates very greatly over the number of females. With regard to the age at which the disease manifests itself, the Bhandara statistics furnish the following table : -20 20- 30- 40- 50- 60 143 196 209 135 50 7 Of 60 cases enquired into in the Chanda District, the disease is said to have appeared in the majority between the ages of 20 and 25. In many cases reported from several districts, the disease appeared in early childhood, and in not a few it was congenital. With regard to the causation of the disease very little informa- tion is added to what is already known. In all the statements furnished, cases appear in which the disease appeared in children of leprous parents, or in which one or more near relatives of the leper had been similarly affected ; and in the reports from many districts the proportion of cases attributed to hereditary transmission is very large. Of 97 cases enquired into in Raipur, one or both parents, or some members of the family, had suffered in 59. Of 734 cases in the Bilaspur District it was said to be hereditary in 265, or 36 per cent., and there was an equal proportion of hereditary cases in nearly the same number of lepers in the Bhandara District. On the other hand, in several districts the proportion of cases attributable to hereditary taint was small ; of the 160 cases returned from the Saugor District, in only ten had the parents of the sufferers been lepers, but on the whole the evidence in favour of leprosy being transmitted from parents to children, and of the taint affecting particular families greatly preponderates. In several of the reports cases are given in which leprosy was considered to have been communicated by persons affected with it to persons who had exhibited no signs of it previously, and in whom there was no ground for attributing hereditary taint ; marriage and cohabitation with a leper has been in several instances assigned as the cause of the disease, but the evidence in these cases that the disease resulted from contact is by no means conclusive. With regard to the supposed connection between leprosy and syphilis, many instances are given in this report in which leprosy followed syphilis and mercurial treatment, and it is not at all unlikely that in individuals in whom the leprous taint may be latent, the disturbance to health, which syphilis and mercurial treatment produce, would favour the development of the disease, but there is no good evidence that the two diseases are allied, or that they are connected in the way of cause and effects. It would appear that the use of mercury is often resorted to as a remedy for leprosy. In one or two of the reports the use of bad grain and of certain kinds of dhal are mentioned as causes of the disease, but no satisfactory evidence is adduced in support of this notion, and after much enquiry directed to this point I have failed to discover any grounds for connecting leprosy with any form of diet, or with deficiency of food.
( 4 ) There is also no good evidence in favour of the opinion that leprosy is a disease of malarial origin. In those parts of the country in which the greatest number of lepers are found, they are more numerous among the town populations and in the more populous localities than in the uncultivated jungle tracts. Cases do not occur with unusual frequency in localities which are reported malarious. With regard to the measure of providing asylums for lepers proposed by Dr. Vandyke Carter, with the view of separating them from the mass of the people, the evidence that has been adduced in favour of leprosy being transmitted in families for several generations, may be sufficient to warrant a belief that if all persons in whom the leprous taint had become evident could be eliminated, and kept strictly separate from the general population, the frequency of the disease would, in the course of three or four generations, be greatly diminished ; but to effect this amount of good, it would be necessary to enact very stringent laws rendering the confinement of all lepers (irrespective of rank and position in life), and even their families, compulsory, at the same time restricting them from marriage and sexual intercourse. It is not likely that any Government will enact such laws, and without them the use of asylums will continue, as at present, to be limited to affording relief and sustenance to lepers of the poorer classes.

Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department. WITH reference to your endorsement No. 144, dated the 5th March 1875, forwarding a copy of Home Department Resolution No. 1-136 of the same date, on the subject of the distribution and causation of leprosy, I am directed to forward, for the information of the Government of India, extracts, paragraphs 57, et seq., from the sanitary report of British Burma for the year 1875, containing the report called for in paragraph 8 of the above resolution. Extracts, paragraphs 57, et seq., from the Sanitary Report of British Burma for the year 1875. Leprosy. PARAGRAPH 57. The result of an enquiry into the distribution and causation of leprosy in this Province, ordered in paragraph 8 of Home Department Resolution of the Government of India, may be given here as the reports called for have only recently been received from civil medical officers. 58. When the resolution was received in the Office of the Sanitary Commis- sioner it seems to have have been overlooked, ultimately printed copies of paragraphs 5 and 8 of the resolution were circulated to civil medical officers, who were requested by the Officiating Sanitary Commissioner to favour him with concise reports on the points regarding which information was required. The reports received are not at all satisfactory; most medical officers confine themselves to saying that they have had no opportunities of observing the disease, and others have sent in long detailed cases descriptive of individual cases of the disease, and the result of the treatment of it by gurjun oil, without paying any attention to the points to which their attention was directed, although not a word was said in the circular forwarding copies of the resolution indicating that a report was required regarding treatment of any kind. The following statement shews that when the last census was taken there were 3,203 lepers in Burma, thus 120 per 1,000 of the population were lepers. The returns do not shew the nation- alities of those affected ; but from personal observation it may be stated that by far the greater proportion of leprosy occurs amongst immigrants, natives of India. Civil medical officers confined their enquiries entirely to the inmates of civil hospitals who had come there for treatment and to lepers amongst prisoners in jails, the number of these has been very limited owing to many causes. The objects which the Government had in view would have been attained more satisfactorily by enquiries instituted amongst lepers throughout the country by distrct officers :    Number of Ratio of lepers Division.

?(   2   ) 59.    The most malarious districts  of the Province,  those  of Akyab,  Kyouk Phyoo  and Sandoway,  were the freest from the disease which was tolerably evenly distributed over Pegu.    It was most prevalent  in  the Tounghoo  and  Shwe-gyeen Districts in Tenasserim; it was not contagious.   One instance was given to prove the contrary: it was that of a man none of whose relations had been lepers, who married a woman with tubercular leprosy, he being at the time in ignorance as to her condi- tion, and the disease shewed itself in him within one year after his marriage.    The couple  had two  children before the disease shewed itself in the husband, and one after, all of whom are healthy.    On the other hand, two cases are reported in which the husbands were   lepers for years, during which time they lived with their wives, who  continued  perfectly  healthy.    The  pecuniary   circumstances  of these  three couples are not mentioned, but from the fact that one of the two latter couples were Europeans,  it is  probable that  they were sufficiently well off to afford themselves good food. 60.    Hereditary  transmission  is  shewn  in   one-third  of the  cases  investi- gated; in the remainder, if the statements of the patients can be believed, it origin- ated de novo. 61.    It has been  thought  that  an   exclusively  fish  diet   tended  to   develop leprosy,  but this  Province affords conclusive evidence to the contrary, as no people eat more fish than the inhabitants of the sea-port towns   in   Arakan,   and  yet  the disease is very rare there, so much so that the civil   medical  officers  of Akyab   and Kyouk Phyoo  report  that  almost all the lepers in these two districts are natives of India, principally of Chittagong. 62.    The Arakan  Division also   shews  that  the  conditions  which  produce malarious fevers have no influence upon the causation of leprosy. 63.    The census returns  shew  that the  Tounghoo   District has  the  largest percentage of lepers, 315 per 1,000. These returns cannot be accepted as correct. The writer of this report was for several years Civil Surgeon of Tounghoo, and can   say that  leprosy is  probably less common   in   that  district  than in any other part of Tenasserim.    The Native  enumerators  probably  put  down  as  leprosy  a  diffuse form of psoriasis very common in Burma.    How far this may  have been the case in other parts of the Province it is hard to say. 64.    All  medical   officers  here  consider  that  poverty, diet  and  insufficient food are the principal exciting causes of leprosy; the first and last do not exist to any great degree in Burma, the second does in most Burman households; but  improper food,   such as  imperfectly cooked green vegetables productive of frequent colic and acute dyspepsia, is common enough.    Lepers, as a rule, belong to the   very   poorest classes  of the  population, and   when  once the  disease   shews  itself they become outcastes from the community to which they belong, they shun their fellowmen, and are reduced to live upon charity.    Under  these circumstances the disease progresses rapidly.    In the town of Moulmein the   Civil   Surgeon   reports   that  they  live in huts  near  the burial-grounds, and   are  employed   about  the grave-yard.    In the villages   and towns they live upon the outskirts and subsist on charity, and in the large towns they frequently resort to theft, and thus a comparatively   large number are inmates  of the  Rangoon   Central   Jail, where a very  complete  trial has been given to the treatment of the disease with gurjun oil, which has been fully reported upon elsewhere.    The deductions to be  drawn   from  the very  imperfect enquiries made in   Burma   are  that leprosy is  not  contagious; that the  principal inciting cause is filth and improper food; that it is transmissible from parent to  offspring, chiefly  in the  female  line; that  it may pass over one generation, which may be perfectly healthy, and appear  in the  third; that the  majority  of cases  originate de novo; that malaria has no influence in causing it, and neither has a fish diet.

No. 2956, dated Shillong, the 16th October 1876. From-S. O. B. RIDSDALE, Esq., Secretary to the Chief Commissioner  of Assam. To-The  Officiating Secretary to  the    Government   of  India,   Home Department. WITH reference to your No. 1-136, dated 5th March 1875, I am directed to forward herewith, for the perusal of His Excellency the Governor General in Council, copy of letter No. 1122, dated 21st instant, and enclosure, from the Deputy Surgeon General, Dacca Circle, on the subject of the treatment of leprosy with gurjun oil. No. 1122, dated Shillong, the 2nd October 1876. From-The Officiating Deputy Surgeon General, Dacca Circle. To-The Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam. WITH reference to your letter No. 2792 of the 20th ultimo, I have the honour to forward herewith the report on the treatment of leprosy with gurjun oil. Report from the Officiating Deputy Surgeon General, Dacca Circle, on the treatment of leprosy by gurjun oil in the Province of Assam,-dated Shillong, the 2nd October 1876. FROM the subjoined abstract of reports on leprosy and its treatment by gurjun oil it would appear- (1)     that leprosy does not exist to any great extent in   Assam,  and that   the Province affords but a limited field for the prosecution of experiments in treatment; (2)    that the hill tracts within and on the borders,  viz.,   Khasi,   Garo,   Abor and Naga Hills, are remarkably exempt; (3)     that the disease is most frequently met with in tracts   of country  at  the foot of the hills; as these localities are rendered unhealthy by jungle growth and neighbouring swamps, a low state of vitality of constitution is presumable, and this, associated with poverty, uncleanly habits, &c., may be considered to afford predisposing causes; (4)    that from its   generally  scattered  and isolated   appearance  in  different localities, no evidence is afforded of its contagious nature; (5)    that the disease is occasionally, though not necessarily, hereditary; (6)    that evidence of the efficacy of gurjun oil treatment is so conflicting as to be negative, the medical officers of Sibsagar and Tezpur report favour- ably, those of Sylhet, Nowgong, Cachar and Goalpara discredit its utility. DEBROOGHUR.-Surgeon Major White, 44th Native Infantry, states that the only cases under his charge occurred amongst sepoys of the regiment who were invalided a few days after coming under his observation. He is unable from per- sonal experience to offer any opinion on treatment by gurjun oil. Amongst the Assamese Proper the disease is not common; nor is it confined to any particular locality. The proportion diseased is estimated at two or three per 1,000 inhabitants. Amongst the Mecris, a nomadic semi-savage race occupying the banks of the Brahmaputra, the disease is more general: they subsist chiefly on roots and pork-the latter the produce of loathsome animals fed on garbage and excrementi- tious matter. Similar food is, however, consumed by the savage tribes inhabiting the hills on both sides of the valley, though leprosy is exceedingly rare amongst them. Evidence of causation of the disease by diet alone would by comparison of these two contiguous instances be negative, and suggests enquiry for some other cause which may be found in difference of climate. Amongst the Abor, Duffla, and Naga tribes the disease is seldom seen; but it is inferred that the sufferers are subjected to such heroic treatment that the remedies employed prove rapidly fatal.
?(    2   ) In Assam the disease is much less frequently met with than formerly, and this decrease is considered to be synchronous with increased prosperity. SIBSAGAR.-M. Mookerjee, Civil Surgeon, reports the treatment of twelve cases. Three of these ceased to attend after the lapse of a few days, and their subsequent history could not be traced. In the remaining nine cases treatment was continued for periods varying from three months to about a year; very great improvement, if not complete recovery, is stated to have occurred in each case. The subjects were males, and, though no change was made in diet, the oil was used precisely in accord- ance with Dr. Dougall's instructions. The cases were in an advanced stage of the ansthetic and tubercular forms of the disease. Under treatment the sores healed and were covered with a cicatrix; tubercular elevations nearly subsided; swelling and thickness of skin abated; sensation generally returned, and patches of discolouration faded. The tubercular form seemed more amenable to treatment than the ansthetic. The Civil Surgeon considers the remedy to be "the best he has ever employed", that its persistent and systematic use proves beneficial in even the worst forms of the disease, and that it certainly arrests the progress of every form of leprosy. He is, however, unable to express a definite opinion from his limited ex- perience whether it entirely eradicates the lepraic taint from the system. The diseased appear to have confidence in the remedy. Leprosy is stated to be common in the Sibsagar District, chiefly among males; it is not confined to any particular locality or race; is more common in youth and middle age, especially when accompanied by poverty. It seldom occurs in infancy or old age, and proof of hereditary transmission was only obtainable in about one-third of the cases. Conditions of life tending to impoverish the blood or impair the vital powers, such as poverty, improper diet, impure air and uncleanly habits, exposure and privations, even found to be predisposing and accelerating causes of the disease. TEZPUR.-Dr. Imthum reports the successful treatment of four cases. No. 1. Leprous ulcers of right cheek and wing of nose of long standing. Cured in less than three months. No. 2. A villager, the majority of whose fingers and toes had been mutilated by tubercular leprosy. Was discharged cured in two months and twelve days. No. 3. A labourer admitted with extensive ulcers of which healed rapidly. Was discharged cured in two months. NOWGONG.-The disease is not prevalent in this district. The Civil Surgeon has not seen on an average more than one case annually. A case came under treatment, but the gurjun oil treatment was not followed by any improvement. He considers poverty and diet to be exciting causes of the disease. GAUHATI.-Leprosy is not frequently met with. The Civil Surgeon could not induce any of the few lepers met with to undergo prolonged treatment. These cases were admitted for other diseases, and as soon as they obtained relief for the latter, discontinued attendance. Patients, he states, object strongly to the conti- nuous inunction enforced as necessary to the plan of treatment. These cases occurred amongst wandering beggars or afflicted coolies, discharged in consequence from tea gardens. SHILLONG.-Leprosy is almost unknown on the Khasi Hills. The Civil Surgeon during a residence of three years has met with only two or three cases, and these occurred amongst travellers who would not submit to treatment. GOALPARA.-Dr. Slane reports that he has personally tried the remedy on only one occasion, and that the result was unsatisfactory. The disease in this case was of six years' duration, and situated about the soles of the feet and roots of the nails. The skin of the face was also glazed and tuberculated. Two cases were treated in the Lakhimpur Branch Dispensary and were returned as relieved, but on subsequent inspection this opinion did not appear to be substantiated. Nine cases were treated in the Gouripur Branch Dispensary; two were returned relieved, and seven ceased attending. The Civil Surgeon does not feel justified from such limited opportunities for observation in recording a favourable opinion. The disease is widely distributed at the foot of the Garo Hills, particularly amongst the Garos and Ralha inhabiting the South and South- West borders of the district; it is also found on the North bank of the Brahma- putra in the Dubri Sub-Division.
?(   3   ) The Hospital Assistant at Dubri reports that 28 cases were discovered in thirteen villages. Neither geological formation nor the presence of jungle and swamps are considered by the Civil Surgeon to have any noticeable effect in developing the disease, but where it occurs elephantiasis is also prevalent. The khessary dl (Tathyms Satraus) and putrid fish are articles of diet largely consumed, and these may exercise a prejudicial effect: the former is supposed to possess poisonous properties cumulative in effects, and only manifested after protracted use. The people are scantily clad, filthy in habits, and undergo much privation nnd exposure. Dr. Slane inclines to a belief in the hereditary nature of the malady, but has not been able to procure confirming evidence from Natives, who, he supposes, dread the social ostracism likely to be entailed on their families by confession. No reliable evidence of the contagious nature of the disease is obtainable. The ansthetic form of the disease with slight tuberculization of the skin of the face and ears is chiefly observed. The skin presents a glazed and prickered appearance with fissures and ulcers about the fingers and toes, which become successively destroyed, but the Civil Surgeon states that he has not met with any case in which a fatal result could be attributable solely to the disease. GARO HILLS.-The Civil Surgeon states that he has been unable to discover the existence of the disease in these hills. SYLHET.-The Civil Surgeon doubts the efficacy of gurjun oil treatment, and does not consider that dispensary practice offers favourable opportunities for testing the experiment. He considers that it could be more completely carried out in jails among prisoners undergoing a long term of imprisonment. He records twenty-two cases, in which, however, the accessories of alteration in diet and rubbing with dry earth were omitted. Of these twenty-two cases one was cured, six improved and the remainder discontinued attendance. Mendicants, who constitute the majority of sufferers, will not submit to the restraints imposed in undergoing a course of treatment. Accustomed to a free and roving mode of life, they have a decided distaste for any measures savouring of discipline. On the other hand, patients who are able to obtain a livelihood by employment are unable to absent themselves from their avocations for a sufficiently long poriod. The disease does not prevail in the district to any great extent: the proportion of lepers to inhabitants being calculated at one to 2,000 inhabitants. In certain portions of the district it prevails to a greater extent than in others, and it is considered that it prevailed to a much greater extent in former years. CACHAR.-Very few cases are met with, and the disease does not appear to be in any way localised. Three cases were treated as in-patients, but without any improvement. Only one of these cases afforded evidence of probable hereditary transmission. N. C. D.-Home, Rev. & Agri. Dept. Press-No. 467-18-8-79-100.
No. 100, dated Hyderabad, the 15th December 1875. From-Major W. TWEEDIE, First Assistant Resident at Hyderabad. To-The Offg. Secretary to the Government of India. WITH reference to the Extract of Proceedings of the Government of India in the Home Department, No. 1-136 of the 5th March last, received with endorsement No. 147 of the same date, relative to leprosy in India, the Officiating Resident has the honour to transmit the accompanying copy of a letter submitted on the subject by the Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, No. 3853 of the 6th instant, and of its accompaniments, from which the action taken to collect particulars will be apparent. No. 394-3218, dated Akola, the 26th November 1875. From-The Sanitary Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. To-The Commissioner of the Hyderabad Assigned Districts. ADVERTING to the papers forwarded under cover of your endorsement No. 972 of this year (now sent back for easy reference and return), I have the honour to state that, agreeably to the instructions contained in paragraph 8 of Government Resolution No. 1-136 of the 5th March last, I on the 21st April 1875 forwarded the whole of the correspondence to Civil Surgeons, and with reference to the above- quoted paragraph asked their co-operation in the enquiry, and hoped that their reports would reach me by the 1st of September last. 2.    I beg now to forward the reports received to this reference for perusal. If you look back to paragraph 8 of the Resolution you will find that these reports were to embrace the following points: (1)   the extent to which leprosy existed; (2)   whether it was localized or not; (3)   if localized, the peculiarities of the localities it occurred in, if any; (4)   the conditions under which they lived (lepers)  if in  any way peculiar, and (5)   information regarding individual cases- (a)   had they arisen from contagion, (b)   were they hereditary. While, if you refer to the reports themselves, you will find that the one from Akola refers to the treatment of two cases, noting in one case that the man's parents had not the disease. The information from Bassim is to the same effect in regard to one case only. From Amraoti and Buldana the information is of the same kind. From Ellichpur it is to the effect that no cases came under treatment. The Civil Surgeon, Wun, writes more to the point, but not enough, so that with the information before me I could not well write the report called for. 3.     Seeing this   to  be  the  case I again addressed Civil Surgeons on the 9th September asking information as to- (1)   the extent to which leprosy exists among the people in the district; (2)   if localized, the locality in which it was chiefly found; (3)   the special peculiarities of this locality if there are any;  and (4)   the special conditions in other respects under which  the people  in  this locality live. 4.    The  replies to these questions I also forward, and, as in the previous case, to save you trouble, give a summary of them. The  Civil  Surgeon,  Amraoti,  regrets  he cannot give the information.    He cannot get about.    He has asked Deputy Commissioner for the information. The Civil Surgeon, Bassim, has met with only one case in his district. The Civil Surgeon, Buldana, forwards reports from dispensary Hospital Assist- ants who refer in these to treatment only. The Medical Officer, Ellichpur, from enquiry, &c., has been unable to discover if leprosy exist or did exist in his district.
(   2   ) The Civil Surgeon, Akola, states that the disease is not common in Akola District, except at Julgaon, and that those affected are chiefly Telees and Buraes, and that their homes and habits are dirty. In this case also Mr. Chamarett's information is more full than that submitted from other districts. 5.    Forwarding  this correspondence to you I hope you will not find me fault- finding.    The real object in my doing  so is that, when information of a certain nature is asked of an officer, it is his duty to give it as fully as he can,  or   to  say he  cannot  give it, while from this correspondence you will observe that all but one officer missed the points of enquiry in the first instance,  and  that  some  of   them repeated  their   mistake   on  these  points   being  put  again  in the plainest words possible, with a result that time has been  lost,   correspondence  increased,  and  no information  gained; whereas  a  little forethought on the part of these  gentlemen would have saved all this. 6.    Please return all the papers now enclosed at your early convenience. No. 3853, dated Amraoti, the 6th December 1875. Endorsed by the Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. FORWARDED for the information of the Resident with reference to First Assist- ant Resident's endorsement No. 1890, dated 28th March 1875. The Commissioner will not trouble the Resident with the large amount of correspondence with the Civil Surgeons which Dr. Abbott has forwarded with his report, because Dr. Abbott has given a summary of it, and because it contains no information that would be of the slightest practical use to Government.

No. 124, dated Hyderabad, the 17th February 1876. From-Major W. TWEEDIE, First Assistant Resident at Hyderabad. To-The Offg. Secretary to the Government of India. IN continuation of this Office letter No. 100, dated the 15th December last, the Officiating Resident has the honour to forward a further communication received from the Commissioner of the Hyderabad Assigned Districts, No. 366, dated 1st instant, with annexure, being a report by the Sanitary Commissioner of the Province on the subject of leprosy. 2. In paragraph 15 of Surgeon Major Abbott's report it is re- commended, as will be seen, that at each dispensary three to six huts should be constructed, and lepers invited to come into them and receive treatment; whereas the Commissioner, Lieutenant-Colonel Nembhard, in paragraph 2 of his endorsement forwarding the report proposes a different arrangement, namely, that pauper lepers should be treated at the head quarter stations under the eye of the Civil Surgeon himself. 3. On the above point Sir R. Meade would merely observe that the practical result of the plan proposed by the Commissioner would too probably be that only the lepers resident near head quarter sta- tions would receive treatment at all, while persons similarly afflicted and residing in outlying districts would be left more or less uncared for through their apathy or disinclination in the matter of resorting to a distance in search of medical relief. He would therefore be in- clined for the present to direct that Surgeon Major Abbott's sugges- tion should be adopted at every dispensary in the Province, while at the same time the object of inducing lepers of the remoter districts to go to head quarter stations to be treated should be kept in view, and, as far as possible, promoted through the influence of the civil officers, of local medical officers, and of the Sanitary Commissioner himself. 4. The question of establishing a leper asylum for the Province generally is one that may be considered hereafter. No. 3-25, dated the 5th January 1876. From-Surgeon Major R. J. ABBOTT, Sanitary Commissioner of the Hyderabad Assigned Districts. To-The Commissioner of the Hyderabad Assigned Districts. AGREEABLY to the instructions contained in Government Resolution No. 1-136 of the 5th March 1875, Home Department, and your No. 972, dated 27th March 1875, I have the honour to submit the following report on leprosy in the Hyderabad Assigned Districts. 2. As directed in above resolution I consulted Civil Surgeons on the subject, but without eliciting any information of value on the questions to be noted herein- after regarding leprosy. 3. According to the census report of 1867 it appears that there were 1,432 lepers in Berar. But some figures I have recently had an opportunity of consulting show either that 1,432 lepers were under the mark in 1867, or that leprosy is on the increase. I am inclined to favour the former view. 4. The census report shews that the lepers were in 1867 distributed in the three districts as follows : Akola ... ... ... ... 348 Mehkur ...  ... ... ... 351 Amraoti ... ... ... ... 278 Elichpur ... ... ... ... 193 Woon ... ... ... ... 262 In other words that they were pretty equally distributed over the Province. This is my experience also, as on enquiry I find that in some villages there are no lepers, while in others-the great minority-that there are one or two, and in some large
(   2   ) places so many as six or seven lepers. Although there is no doubt some large places in Berar in which more than six or seven lepers may be found, I cannot call any to mind in which I have seen more, and therefore conclude that there are but few places in which more will be found. 5.    It is  said above  that  the  disease  is pretty equally distributed over the Province, which is true, but is more general in the tract of the country immediately South of the Satpura Hills extending from Banar and Sainderzanna  in  the  East, to Janode in the West; but even in this tract, although undoubtedly leprosy is more common than in other parts of the Province, it is not anything like  present in  all villages or to an alarming extent in any. 6.    The soil of this locality in which the disease is  most  common  is trapean and dater is near the surface, but the same may be said of other localities where the disease is not so prevalent as here, the only difference  there in it  is  its  proximity to the hills. 7.    The conditions of the people and those under which they live are the same as in the other parts of Berar, but it is said that they are   more  liable  to   attacks of fever than those who live further from the hills in the plains. 8.    It does not attach itself to any particular caste.    People of any caste may become lepers. 9.    Sex appears to bear a marked influence on its  appearance,   infinitely  more males  than   females  appearing with  it, but this perhaps may be accounted for by the females with it, and without it indeed also, being shy. 10.    I have no evidence pro or con as to the contagiousness or otherwise of the disease.    My own impression is that it is not contagious. 11.    And there is absolutely no evidence to show that it is a flower of syphilis, but this is  no  reason why  it   should  be said that leprosy is caused by syphilis as hosts of people have had syphilis who never become lepers. 12.    As  to  whether  the  disease  is hereditary   or not, the evidence, small of course, is negative; in some cases hereditary influence was positively denied,  while in others it was clearly traced. 13.    It is  a  disease  which   generally  appears after the age of 25 years, but has been seen in some much younger, even in an infant  in arms in one case. 14.    The treatment,  as recommended  by  Dr.  J.   Dougall   from   all reports, appears to me very successful. 15.    Lastly, as to what is to be done.    Nothing on a large scale.    All   that I would recommend is that at each dispensary three to six huts be constructed, accord- ing to the size and requirements of the place, and lepers invited to come into them to receive treatment.    After a time when the well-to-do  lepers   see   that   the  poor lepers are relieved or cured at our dispensaries,  they will gladly place  themselves under treatment. 16. According to the original instructions, I have been brief in putting down what I have to say on the subject; but I trust not too brief to shew the condition of Berar as regards leprosy, and what, in my opinion, is required for those afflicted.

FORWARDED to the 1st Assistant Resident with reference to his endorsement No. 1809, dated 25th March 1875. 2. With regard to the arrangement proposed by the Sanitary Commissioner in his 15th paragraph, the Commissioner thinks that it would be better if the pauper lepers were to be treated at the head quarter station, where the Civil Surgeon himself could superintend the treatment.

?No. 9417-G 52, dated Bangalore, the 30th January 1878. From-Major R. A. COLE, Offg. Secretary to the  Chief Commissioner   of Mysore. To-The Offg. Secretary to the Government of India, Home Dept. WITH reference to the Resolution of the Government of India No. 1-136, dated 5th March 1875, on Dr. Carter's report on leprosy in Norway and its identity with the leprosy of India, in which it was requested that a concise summary of all the facts collected on the distribution and causation of the disease in this Province might be submitted, I am now directed to forward, for the information of the Government of India, copy of a report by the Officer in charge of the Deputy Surgeon General's Office and Surgeon attached to this Commission on the prevalence of the disease in the Province, from which it will be observed that the results of the enquiries instituted are not quite satisfactory, and have not produced, as stated by Dr. Henderson, "any very valuable contributions to the already known records of the disease". But to avoid any further delay, which the Chief Commissioner much regrets, the report is submitted in its present form. The substance of all replies received from the several revenue officers serving under this Administration has also been summarised by Dr. Henderson, and his remarks thereon appended. REPORT   ON   LEPROSY. INTRODUCTORY.-Information regarding leprosy in the Province of Mysore has been sought from two sources: 1st, from the various Civil Surgeons being asked to report on, or to record their views or experience; and, 2nd, from all the Deputy Com- missioners and amildars and revenue officers being asked to give replies to a set of questions circulated upon the subject. The first, it was thought, would give the results of scientific observation or thought, and the second, the popular views and ideas upon this disease which unfortunately has made itself only too familiarly known and felt. I regret to say, however, that the collected results of the information obtained from these two sources have not produced any very valuable contributions to the already known records of the disease. The Civil Surgeons, with the exception of Dr. Oswald, have all declared their inability, neither from want of opportunity or leisure, or study of the subject, to furnish anything worthy of record; and the contributions from the other source, as may be supposed, contained a very great variety of opinions and vague statements. For myself I must also plead want of any particular insight or experience, and want of time in the days of unusual sickness, famine and distress, and can only in this brief report give a summary of what is contained in the above papers. These have been handed over to me by the Deputy Surgeon General proceeding on tour, and at his request I draw up this report, and think it better to do so and submit it at once (as it is already too long delayed) than wait for further information. I regret that it must be imperfect and wanting in scientific nature. Dr. Oswald having had charge of the leper asylum in Bangalore for many years, and had more experience in the matter than any one else, is worthy of being heard; and, as his remarks are short and to the point, I shall transcribe them as they stand- DR. OSWALD'S REPORT.-"Leprosy in both its forms, tubercular and ansthetic, is a common disease amongst all classes of Natives in Bangalore, and, I believe, throughout the Mysore territory generally. It appears to manifest itself at all ages, even in very young children, and in both sexes. I am unable to state that it is more common in one sex than the other. "Its progress seems slow, as there are cases in the asylum here who have been affected with it for many years, and in whom I see little change; but there is no doubt that, generally speaking, it greatly abbreviates life.
?(   2   ) "I have never seen a case of leprosy in a European, nor do I remember one in an East Indian or Eurasian, but it seems common amongst Brahmins, Hindus, Mussalman and Pariah, high and low, rich and poor, in those who are cleanly in their habits as well as in those who are filthy, amongst flesh-eating as well as amongst non-flesh-eating people. It is generally supposed to be common amongst the lower and poorer classes (or those who keep themselves more filthy), but I am not aware that there is any proof of this, and the belief has probably arisen from this class seeking pecuniary relief, and so coming more under observation, and because leprosy often entails poverty. "Of the actual extent to which leprosy exists, I have no means of forming an accurate opinion, and it is a question which can only be decided by calling for statistical taluk returns from the officials. "Leprosy does not appear to be localized in any particular district of Mysore. "No particular occupation or employment has been noticed by me specially to give rise to the disease. "The country round Bangalore is an elevated undulating comparatively tree- less plateau, about 3,000 feet above sea-level, and equidistant from East and West Coast (viz., about 200 miles from each). Numerous artificial reservoirs for water are met with in all directions. The soil is principally a red porous fertile loam; numerous granite gneiss quarries exist. The cultivation is 'wet' under the em- bankments of the tanks, but is chiefly what is known as 'dry'. Rice and raggy are the staple grain and food of the country. The interior of Native dwellings are, as a rule, kept scrupulously clean with the exception of the lowest classess. Cattle are almost always kept in the courtyard, and even inside the houses. Outside, the drainage is very bad, and heaps of filth abound in close proximity to every house. It is the common opinion that the disease is hereditary. I have frequently seen the children of leprous parents become leprous also. I do not think it is contagious; the servants of the leper asylum have been employed in it for years, and have never contracted the disease, and women have lived in cohabitation with their leprous husbands without contracting the disease. I have noticed that Natives themselves shew no fear of contracting the disease by being in communication with lepers, but hardly touch them as they would other people. "The belief exists that leprosy is on the increase, but whether it is so or not I have not the means of forming an accurate opinion. "There is a small leper asylum in Bangalore, but it is looked upon more as a place of refuge than a hospital for the treatment of the disease, the opinion amongst Natives being universal that the disease is incurable. "As a place of refuge, it is not freely resorted to, as the lepers dislike exceed- ingly the confinement and restriction of the place. "I have not attempted any description of the symptoms and the pathology of the disease, as I have nothing to add to what is already known on these points; and as regards treatment, I may say I have never seen any benefit from any kind of treatment. This was also the experience of my predecessors who were in charge of the asylum for a great many years. At present the gurjun oil treatment is being tried, but without at present much benefit apparently, and it is very much disliked by the lepers on account of the trouble it entails on them in rubbing in. "According to my experience the sores and ulcers often heal up themselves with ordinary hygenic means, and the disease becomes arrested as it were for a time, but it usually breaks out again after a longer or shorter period." The substance of what has been given in the replies by the revenue officers I have summarised as follows: SUMMARY OF INFORMATION GIVEN BY REVENUE OFFICERS.-Leprosy prevails pretty generally over the whole of the Province of Mysore and to a less extent in Coorg. In some taluks there appear to be more, and in some less, but the general proportion is said to be one per 1,000. In the Taluks of Hassan, Closepett, and Anekul, it is said to be very rare. In Nagar Taluk and in Munzirabad it is said not to exist. In Kolar and Tumkur Districts the proportions are given at higher rates than elsewhere. The type or kind which is most prevalent is said to be " mixed", that is presenting signs and symptoms derived from both tuberculated and ansthetic. Everywhere the cases are isolated, and not congregated or collected in huts or villages by themselves. No peculiarity of soil or climate is mentioned as favouring
(    3    ) its appearance or development, but most agree in saying that bad or insanitary habits of life, unwholesome food, bad water, bad air (as also moral delinquencies) are apt to induce the disease. The majority state that men and low caste people are more liable to it than women and high caste persons. The prevailing opinion is that the disease is not hereditary nor contagious, nor communicable even among people living in as close connection as husband and wife. Upon these points, however, there is considerable variety of opinion, and it would seem that whatever their beliefs may be, the practical behaviour in the matter is to avoid the society of the leper. There is a pretty general consensus that the disease will arise spontaneously in a family previously non-leprous, which would seem to indicate its endemic origin. Non-leprous persons are not considered likely to contract leprosy by living in the midst of lepers, although some who say it is not contagious seem to think they may, and the disease once in a family is considered ineradicable. But this is a point upon which any one individual experience is scarcely sufficient to enable him to form a judgment. The disease in its usual form is said to be mild, and also it is said that lepers live to a very fair age, and that they die chiefly from increase of the diease itself or from resulting debility. The collateral diseases to which they are subject are said to be phthisis, bronchitis, diseases of bowels and exhaustion of nervous system. The disease is said to be on the decrease, and that it never attacks Europeans or East Indians; one or two cases of it, however, in East Indians have been mentioned to me. The Native races and peoples are said to be all subject to it, but that of them the Mussalmans and Pariahs are mostly affected. It is a curious fact that in the leper asylum at Bangalore, out of the 42 cases there at present, seven are Native Christians. But I fancy that the conversion has generally been subsequent to the disease, and more from the sufferers having become outcastes than from any religious convictions. Fish diet is generally pronounced to be conducive to the appearance of leprosy; but upon the subject of climate much difference of opinion exists,-some stating their belief that cold and wet will promote it, while others equally declare against heat and dryness. Syphilis is considered to be in some way connected with leprosy, but how is not stated. Lepers are generally thought to have few children, and that although the rule is they are tainted with the disease, yet there are numerous exceptions, especially where only one parent is affected. Here there is some inconsistency shewn among those who have already declared it not to be hereditary. In regard to its appearance after passing over one generation, it has been observed to do so, but no account is given of what may be the proportion of such cases. No registers are kept of these people, but all say that this might easily be done. Of Native remedies for the disease, the one most in repute is copper adminis- tered as oxyde or sulphate in powder mixed with oil. Mercury and arsenic are also used. Sulphur is recommended and bitter herbs, with a long list of others whose action perhaps needs some aid from the imagination, as killing a double- headed snake, ashes of tigers and elephants' shins, pilgrimages, vows and penances of sorts. The diet prescribed is chiefly milk, curds and unstimulating food. There is no leper asylum for the reception and special treatment of these people except at Bangalore. REMARKS. The above is a summary of what is contained in the replies given by the revenue officers. I would beg to record as my own opinion that the extent of the disease is not so great as therein given. I think that under half per mille is nearer the mark. Also that I consider it hereditary and communicable in some ways, for instance by inoculation or by vaccination; that it is curable in slight cases, but incurable in its grave forms, or when it has made considerable progress. Also that it is fostered and perhaps originated by insanitary habits of life. There can be no doubt that it is more prevalent amongst the poor and ill-fed classes with their dirty habits and insufficient ill-regulated ways of living. The most noticeable fact concerning it in Mysore is its existence upon this high plateau, its locality being mostly on the sea-coast or in the plains. This would show its endemic origin, but from what course I cannot say. The climate
?(   4   ) and soil should generally afford some explanation, but there are no peculiarities which would lead to the origin of such a terrible disease. The lower classes of Mysore are poor, and they suffer much from fever which debilitates their constitu- tion, and reduces their means of living; and thus they fall into chronic cachexies and bad state of health; but whether this has anything to do with the develop- ment of leprosy, I am not prepared to say. I have not been able to discover whether any particular locality is markedly more affected than another. According to the statements given by the revenue officers, the Eastern parts furnish more cases than the Western, but the data are scarcely reliable. The disease is, however, no doubt mild in kind, seldom to be seen in its most dreadful and loathsome forms. The ansthetic. variety is very much the most common. Of the 42 cases now in the Leper Asylum at Bangalore, 20 are ansthetic, 9 tubercular, and 13 mixed. These cases all belong to the lower orders, and followed menial occupations There are 8 Mussalmans, 13 Pariahs and 21 low castes (Hindus), 24 are men and 18 women, 25 are married and 17 single: of the married 16 have children, most of whom are affected with the disease. The ages of these patients vary from 4 to 60 years, and their residence here 3 to 30 years; 11 of them belong to Madras or the plains where they were when the disease first appeared, 20 belong to Bangalore and are of a mixed race, 11 to the districts. This shews that but one quarter of the number are properly of the Mysore Pro- vince. They are kept in separation, but hitherto those who have been married pre- vious to admission have been allowed to live together. The treatment consists chiefly in cleanliness and applications of gurjun oil to the sores; tonic medicines internally or what may be required; good diet and attention to sanitary matters. Suffering is mitigated, and the disease is sometimes temporarily arrested, but Mr. D'Cruz, the Apothecary, who has been in immediate charge of the asylum for many years, informs me that he does not know of a case of complete cure. They are not allowed to go out, but have no particular employment in-door. The asylum is not a good one, being merely part of an old jail, and is defec- tive in many ways, but still it is a refuge and a place where the leper can go to be out-of-the-way of public sight. This is one of the most dreadful diseases in its worst forms with which man- kind is afflicted, destroying as it does both body and mind, health and happiness. It is a sad fact that these unfortunate lepers, shocking as they are to sight, are still more to be pitied in the evidence they shew of quarrelsome disposition and an unhappy state of mind. The practical conclusion of an enquiry into this disease should be, I think, that every thing should be done to eradicate it, and great care taken to prevent its spread whether by intermarriage, by insanitary habits, by inoculation or vaccina- tion, or by irregular living. That information regarding it (as far as can be got) be made known, and attention to sanitary laws impressed or enforced among the people; that marriage be discountenanced in mild cases, and prohibited in bad; and that all bad cases be placed in leper asylums for detention there under proper care.
