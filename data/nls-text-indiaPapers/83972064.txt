I.5 A Musician is at the service of the patients 4 times a week in the male section and twice a week in the female section. He is very popular with the patients and it is gratifying to note that even the chronic insanes and excited patients listen to his music with great interest. On the female section a temporary Recreation room has been opened. Both these rooms are equipped with various musical instruments. Feasts were given to the Hindus, Muhammadans and Christians at their festivals. Patients' religious feeling and sentiments are respected as far as practi- cable and many are encouraged to observe fasts. Patients are allowed to shop at Ranchi when out for motor drives.

To prepare the existing Kanke soil to yield a fairly good vegetable crop much money, labour and water are necessary and even then it seems doubtful whether the soil will improve up to the desired standard. Building.8 Clerical Staff.9 After all the stores purchasing and equipment arrangements were completed and the Railway arrangements fixed up, I proceeded to Kanke and there commenced preparations with a nucleus staff. All the necessary arrangements for the opening of the hospital were completed by the end of August 1925 and the Ranchi Indian Mental Hospital was ready to receive patients on the 4th September 1925 on which date the first batch of 110 patients from Patna was admitted.

REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE MENTAL HOSPITALS FOR INDIANS IN BIHAR AND ORISSA FOR THE YEARS 1924-1926. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] PATNA: SUPERINTENDENT, GOVERNMENT PRINTING, BIHAR AND ORISSA, 1928. [Price Re. 1, annas 6.]
PRICED PUBLICATIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA CAN BE HAD FROMNo.16724/H-335-27. FROM THE INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF CIVIL HOSPITALS, BIHAR AND ORISSA To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA, LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT. Dated Patna, the 7th December 1927. SUBJECT:2 total deaths during this year numbered 52 (46 males and 6 females). The corresponding figures for 1925 and 1924 were respectively 115 (105 males and 10 females) and 117 (96 males and 21 females) for " cured ", 42 (35 males and 7 females) and 16 (11 males and 5 females) for "improved", 6 and 1 (all males) for "not improved" and 73 (61 males and 12 females) and 60 (48 males and 12 females) for death. The daily average strength and daily average sick were 1350.66 (1146.87 males and 203.79 females) and 54.10 (46.86 males and 7.24 females) respectively in 1926 as compared with 1265.03 (1074.63 males and 190.40 females) and 120.28 (98.11 males and 22.17 females) in 1924. 5. The total accommodation at present available in the Kanke Indian Mental Hospital is for 1,286 patients only (1,014 males and 272 females) while the maximum number of patients resident in the hospital on any one night in 1926 was 1,391 (1,172 males and 219 females). The above figures indicate considerable overcrowding in the male section. The question of providing additional accommodation is under consideration. The schemes for constructing new buildings for this purpose are being examined and the work will, it is hoped, be carried out quickly so soon as Government sanction is obtained and funds provided. Many of the other recommendations contained in the Super- intendent's report, which fully deals with the present situation of the Kanke Indian Mental Hospital, are also under the consideration of Government. 6. I wish to pay a tribute to the work of Captain Dhunjibhoy and his whole staff. In a new institution of this kind many difficulties arise. These have been tackled not only with ability but also by real hard labour and this labour has fallen chiefly on the Superintendent and his office staff and also on the staff of the Stores Department. The work of Dr. Joytirmoy Ray and the medical staff has also been very satisfactory. I have the honour to be SIR, Your most obedient servant, W. S. WILLMORE, M.D., M.R.C.P., COL., I.M S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Bihar and Orissa.
REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE RANCHI INDIAN MENTAL HOSPITAL, KANKE FOR THE YEAR 1926. 1. Administration.2 I am of opinion that this number would have been larger, had there existed proper nursing arrangements and adequate medical staff. The sanc- tioned medical staff is small in proportion to the large population and consequently it is not possible to accord individual treatment. At present each Sub-Assistant Surgeon in the male section has nearly 400 patients under his charge and each Assistant Surgeon has 700 patients under his charge. The above figures indicate that it is next to impossible for the medical officer to attend to every individual case. This was pointed out at the informal conference which met on the 20th July 1926. The conference recommended the entertainment of male nurses and the increased medical staff and it is desirable that the male nurses and the increased medical staff should be sanctioned as early as possible. In addition a large number of newly admitted patients was found to be suffering from chronic mental diseases as they were kept at home without any treatment and admitted to the hospital when they became unmanageable or proved dangerous to themselves or others. Mental disease is as curable in its early stage as bodily disease, and incurable like other general disease in its chronic stage. The root of the evil is I believe the fancied stigma and disgrace attached to the mental hospitals. Mental cases requiring treatment should be sent to the hospital as early as possible. The earlier the admission, the better the chances of cure. 12. Percentage of deaths.3 14. The daily average number of patients treated in the Infirmaries for bodily ailments was 54.10 (46.86 males and 7.24 females). The important admissions are shown in the following table:4 in mental and this can be realised by a walk round one of the modern mental hospitals. As late as the 18th century insanes were kept in chains. Modern mental hospitals give insanes irrespective of their crimes as much freedom as possible. Experience teaches us that this method helps the reco- very rate. As the Indian Mental Hospital is run on modern lines, great freedom is allowed to all patients irrespective of their crimes. In spite of this only five patients escaped during the year under review, out of which four were recaptured and brought back. One sane convict patient is still at large. The staff concerned found negligent in these cases were suitably dealt with. 19. Suicide.5 and the Government was pleased to issue a circular letter no. 2013-2061, dated the 12th July 1924, requesting all the District Magistrates, Judges and Presidency Magistrates of that Province to treat such so called " offences " as possible symptoms of lunacy and to proceed to deal with such cases under sections 13 to 17 of the Lunacy Act. I therefore suggest that a similar circular in this Province may be issued and the Government of Bengal be requested to once again draw the attention of the committing Magistrates to their above stated circular. Another difficulty has been the non-compliance with section 76(1) of Bihar and Orissa Lunatic Asylums Manual, 1918, in 48 cases sent for treatment. 22. Treatment of Mental Condition.6 for Hydrotherapy treatment have already been submitted to Government and as it is an indispensable branch of treatment in a modern mental hospital it is hoped the proposal will be sanctioned as early as possible. (4) Parole.7 during their respective festivals. Patients' religious feelings and sentiments are respected as far as possible and all are encouraged to observe fasts. (6) Diet.8 25. Conferences.9 It seems necessary that in view of the present congestion of the hospital and the inadequacy of the staff, the recommendations of the Conference should be given effect to as early as possible. CONFERENCE FOR GARDEN SCHEME. In order to devise means to make the hospital self-supporting so far as possible in respect of daily supplies of vegetables, a second conference consis- ting of the following officers of the Government of Bihar and Orissa was held on the 31st August 1926 at this hospital during the year under review :10 The garden staff consists of the following : 11 a minimum as far as practicable during the year under review. Although this is the 2nd annual report of the hospital it is in fact the first full annual report, as it gives the actual working cost of the hospital for complete 12 months on full strength. The annual report of 1925 only covers a period of 4 months and during this period of 4 months the hospital did not run full strength. The average cost per head exclusive of Public Works Department charges in 1925 was Rs. 351-9-3 and that too for a period of 4 months without full strength whereas in 1926 annual cost per head exclusive of Public Works Department charges was Rs. 489-12-3 for 12 months with full strength. The abovementioned figures are self-explanatory with respect to our effort at economy, and the cost per head will still further be reduced once the hospital is thoroughly established and is made partly self-supporting to which direction our energies are now concentrated. 23.

No. 3227-L.S.-G. GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA. (MINISTRY OF LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT.) RESOLUTION. The 21st March 1928. READ2 5. These difficulties and others too numerous to mention in this resolution were discussed at an informal conference of representatives of the Government of Bengal and of this Government in July 1926 ; and this conference made detailed recommendations regarding the additional buildings and staff required. The improvements recommended by this conference were the subject of considerable correspondence with the Government of Bengal; and in order that improvements might be effected with the minimum of delay in future a managing committee has been constituted subsequent to the period under report. It is hoped that within the next 12 months effect will have been given to all the more urgent recommendations of the conference in the way of additional staff, and that a beginning will have been made in the construction of the additional buildings more urgently required. 6. Considerable improvement in the diet of patients has been effected by the laying out of a vegetable garden in 1927 within the grounds and it is satisfac- tory to find that the full requirements of the Hospital have been supplied from this garden since the close of the period under review. 7. Government in the Ministry of Local Self-Government desire to record their appreciation of the energy displayed by Captain J. E. Dhunjibhoy, I.M. S., Superintendent of the Indian Mental Hospital, in what has been an exception- ally, difficult and trying task, and of the excellent work done by Dr. Joytirmoy Ray, 1st Assistant Superintendent, and by the rest of the staff. By order of the Government of Bihar and Orissa, Ministry of Local Self-Government, G. E. OWEN, Offg. Secretary to Government.

FROM THE INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF CIVIL HOSPITALS, BIHAR AND ORISSA, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA, LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT. Dated Patna, the 7th May 1928. SUBJECT:A REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE RANCHI INDIAN MENTAL HOSPITAL, KANKE, FOR THE YEAR 1927. 1. Administration.2 10. Daily average strength of the hospital was 1409.53 (1181.54 males and 227.99 females) as compared with 1350.66 (1146.87 males and 203.79 females) in the previous year. 11. Ratio per cent. of cures to the daily average strength was 15.74 males and 14.04 females, total 15.54 against 8.54 males and 7.36 females, total 8.36 in the previous year. Ratio per cent. of cures to the total admission during the year under report was 30.87 males and 13.20 females, total 27.41 compared with 7.41 males and 5.06 females, total 6.78 in the previous year. 12.

Accidents and injuries.5 The hospital is fully equipped with the latest gramophone machines and a large stock of most up-to-date Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Oriya and English records. Records are purchased every year and the selection is made by the patients assisted by the staff. On odd days in the week when musicians do not entertain the patients the gramophones are greatly in demand and patients enjoy the playing of them immensely. During the Pujahs, the Funnyman of Calcutta entertained the patients one evening. During the year under report patients were also entertained one evening by a famous magician. Occasionally some clever musicians from the inmates of the hospital also entertain patients. The temporary recreation halls of both the sections are fully equipped with various musical instruments. Feasts were given to all the patients during the Pujah and Holi festivals. Special feasts were given to Hindu, Muhammadan and Christian patients during their respective festivals. Patients' religious feelings and sentiments are respected as far as practicable and many are encouraged to observe fasts on religious grounds if they so desire and a special diet is arranged for them. 23. Diet.6 There was an increase in the number of mosquitoes during the year under report. This is due to some of the kutcha drains in the area which cannot always be kept absolutely clean. On the whole sanitation of the whole area of the Indian Mental Hospital was quite satisfactory. 28. Garden scheme.7 The following newspapers and monthly magazines were continued to be supplied gratis to this hospital for the patients by the sympathetic and kind proprietors to whom my best thanks are due :8 In spite of this increased expenditure on establishment, it is satisfactory to report that there has been a steady decrease in the total expenditure per head as will be seen from the following table :9 33. General.10 The function of the Committee is to advise the Government of Bihar and Orissa on all questions affecting the general administration or future develop- ment of the hospital which may be referred to it by Government or raised by it on its own initiative.

Priced Publications of the Government of Bihar and Orissa can be had fromNo. 7496/ H-14-29* FROM THE INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF CIVIL HOSPITALS, BIHAR AND ORISSA, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA, LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT. Dated Patna, the 11th May 1929. SUBJECT.Report on the working of the Ranchi Indian Mental Hospital for the year 1928. 1. Administration.2 12. Causes of death.3 sent here for observation by orders of the High Court, Patna, was returned to the Ranchi Jail, 6 male cases were certified harmless insanes and were released by the committing Magistrate to the care of relatives. One female was discharged as uncertifiable. 16. Criminal insanes.4 It is notable that assaults are more common with newly-admitted cases. In my opinion this is due to the fact that insane patients whether violent, aggressive or otherwise are often roughly handled by tactless, unsympathetic relatives and friends before admittance. The result is that they temporarily develop a wild temper due to continuous bad treatment and assault anyone with whom they come into contact. Such patients become docile, amiable and admirably adapt themselves with the disciplinary routine of the institution in a very short time under treatment which consists in of a mixture of tact, kindness, sympathy and liberty of speech and action. I take this opportunity of recording my grateful acknowledgment of the services of those attendant staff who suffered bodily ailments due to unprovoked assaults by patients during the year under report. 23 Post-mortem.5 (2) Drugs, etc.6 departments of this hospital (including the garden) turned out goods to the value of Rs. 26,689-4-0 during the year under report and these were partly sold to the public and largely utilized for the use of the hospital. This institution is not fortunate enough to possess the services of occupational therapists for both the sections of the hospital, yet the patients quietly carry on very useful work. In this connection I reproduce the following letter sent to me by the Representative of the League of Nations who visited the hospital in company with the foreign health officials in January 1928 :7 I reproduce the following letter :8 28. Diet.9 30. Buildings.10 On the other hand the cost of establishment is going up. This is likely to continue to increase as staff still required for the hospital is sanctioned. The following table shows the gradual increase in the cost of establishment charges per head :11 (2) The permanent Matron went on long leave on medical grounds and Miss L. G. Mewa, C.M.B., was appointed to officiate in her place. 33. Commendation.(4) Congestion.STATEMENT No. I.

TRIENNIAL REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE RANCHI INDIAN MENTAL HOSPITAL, KANKE IN BIHAR AND ORISSA FOR THE YEARS 1927-1929 PATNA : SUPERINTENDENT, GOVERNMENT PRINTING, BIHAR AND ORISSA. 1931.
Priced Publications of the Government of Bihar and Orissa can be had fromNo. 14194/H-241-30 FROM THE INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF CIVIL HOSPITALS, BIHAR AND ORISSA, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA, LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT. Patna, the 15th December 1930. SUBJECT.Report on the working of the Ranchi Indian Mental Hospital for the Triennium 19272 is much less accommodation available for their mental patients in hospitals than that provided by other provinces in India. Provinces. Total population. Accommodation available for mental patients (per mille) in hospitals. 1 2 3 Bengal and Bihar and Orissa ... ... 80.69 millions .002 United Provinces ... ... ... 45.37 3 majority of those admitted during the latter period were chronic cases and merely transfers who had been for years already in residence in other Mental Hospitals, namely Berhampore, Dacca and Patna Mental Hospitals. 5. The maximum number resident in the hospital on any one night was 1,274 (1,065 males, 209 females) in 1929 against 1,395 (1,161 males, 234 females) in 1928 and 1,438 (1,196 males, 242 females) in 1927. 6. Total admissions.4 (b) The ratio per cent. of cures to the total admissions was 16.94 males, 22.22 females, total 18.60 in 1929 against 30.86 males, 16.00 females, total 27.36 in 1928 and 30.87 males, 13.20 females, total 27.41 in 1927. The marked decrease in 1929 is due to the fact that a larger number of incurable cases was admitted during the year. Besides, owing to restriction imposed on admission for want of accommodation in this hospital, many patients prior to their admission into this hospital had to remain in jails, in some cases for months together, which also greatly retarded the progress of early recovery. This procedure was unfortunately unavoidable. Birth.5 The important admissions to the Infirmaries during the triennium under report are shown in the following table :6 The gradual decrease in the number is partly due to the fact that several old patients charged with petty offences were subsequently transferred to the non-criminal class with the sanction of the Government concerned and partly due to the restricted admission of patients. It is a matter of regret that the tendency on the part of the Committing Magistrates to send such patients as criminal patients instead of as non-criminal patients has not yet ceased. 16. Statement no. III gives the religion, sex and residence of the patients admitted during the period under review. 17. Statement no. IV shows the previous occupation of patients admitted into this hospital during the period under review. 18. Statement no. V shows the ages of patients admitted during the triennium under review. It will appear from the statement given below that the age that supplied the largest number of inmates during the triennium was between 20 to 40. The age between 40 and 60 claims the next in order of frequency.

Statement no. VI deals with the types of insanity treated during the triennium under report. Mania, Melancholia, Dementia Praecox and Toxic Insanity (Ganja) were the principal types treated in the hospital during the triennium under report. One case of chronic Encephalitis Lethargica was admitted in 1929 and another case of this disease was diagnosed by Major J. E. Dhunjibhoy,I.M.S., in 1928, besides the 11 cases of chronic Encephalitis Lethargica which were suspected in 1927 were later definitely diagnosed as such by him. It is interesting to note that the occurrence of this disease among the admissions in Mental Hospitals in India was first brought to notice in 1928 by Major Dhunjibhoy. 20. Paying patients.7 made by potential suicides generally by trying to strangle or hang themselves. The attendant staff of the Suicidal Ward deserve much credit for their unremitting vigilance which prevented any misadventure from happening among a large number of patients. 22. Accidents and injuries.8 The weight chart of the patients showed a general rise throughout the triennium under report. In 1929, it was noticed that the male patients gained weights on the average 1.32 lbs. per head and the female patients 6.30 lbs. per head. As usual, forcible feeding and nasal feeding were resorted to as often as necessary in several cases. One Stupor case has been nasally fed for the last 28 months. (iii) Malarial Therapy.9 (viii) Musical and other entertainments.10 The books are in great demand by the literate patients who form no insignificant part of the population. The following newspapers and monthly magazines were supplied free of cost for the patients throughout the triennium under report by their kind and sympathetic proprietors to whom our best thanks are due :11 supply of green vegetables to the full requirement of the hospital (9 to 10 maunds daily) was constant and regular throughout the triennium under review. In addition, fruits, e.g., papayas, guavas, bananas, peaches, mangoes, etc., were also supplied to the patients from the hospital orchard during 1928 and 1929. Besides, surplus vegetables were sold to the public at the prevailing market rates. For want of adequate water-supply potatoes could not be grown during the triennium under notice. But the managing committee have since approved of my proposal to provide four wells in the garden area. The present source of irrigation is only a tank and a portion of sullage water of the hospital. The following table shows the total income from the garden. Details. Income. 1927. 1928. 1929. 1 2 3 4 Rs. Rs. Rs.

The grain gola which was built for the purpose of storing grains is being partly utilized since 1929 for experiments in the storage of grains which is still being carried on by the Imperial Entomologist of the Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa. The whole year's consumption of rice and dal will be purchased in the cheapest season and scientifically stored in the bins of the grain gola. 31. Finance.13 and fourteen sets of Attendants' quarters were constructed in 1929 in addition to several other minor works projects.

Patna, the 24th January 1931. Triennial report on the working of the Ranchi Indian Mental Hospital for the years 1927, 1928 and 1929. READ2 3. In the circumstances described in the preceding paragraph curative treatment must obviously be carried on under serious disadvantages. In the three years only 63, 67 and 60 paying patients could be admitted ; nor is there any suitable accommodation for them. A scheme has however almost been worked out for constructing paying patients' wards and for changing a scale of fees which when the wards are full should make them completely self-support- ing. Again the progressive decrease in the percentage of cures to admissions which was 27.41 in 1927, 27.36 in 1928, and 18.60 in 1929 may reasonably be ascribed to the fact that in the last two years the Superintendent has been unable to admit any but dangerous patients who are mostly incurable. It is therefore satisfactory to find that the percentage of deaths to daily average strength, which was 3.30, 3.41 and 1.91 in the three years has decreased appreciably as has also the daily average number of sick patients which was 65.45, 68.67 and 57.42 in each of the three years. Meanwhile there has been an increase in the number of treatments by hydrotherapy (9, 39 and 43) in the three years ; the weaving section has been considerably expanded, and to those who remember the Patna Mental Hospital the list of amusements which includes dramatic performances, a radio set, concert performances, feasts and picnics, makes pleasant reading. 4. The more interesting figures relating to finance are first those of the increase in receipts which rose (in thousands of rupees) from 14 in 1927 to 18 in 1928 and to 20 in 1929 and which was due mainly to an increase in sales of manufactures and vegetables from the vegetable garden, and secondly those of the average annual cost per patient which stood at Rs. 375, Rs. 357 and Rs. 418, exclusive of Public Works Department charges, and including those charges, at Rs. 442, Rs. 475 and Rs. 605 in the three years. The increase in these charges was due to an inevitable increase in construction expenditure which amounted to 95, 1,58 and 2,30 in each of the three years. The quarters required for the existing staff according to the present scale of accommodation are now almost completed except quarters for the matron and nurses, for which funds have not yet been found. 5. The thanks of Government are due to the Members of the Managing Committee for the valuable assistance which they have rendered ; to the visitors for the encouragement which they have given to the patients by their visits, to Major Dhunjibhoy for the energy and administrative ability with which he has continued to run the institution, and to Dr. P. C. Das, for successfully carrying on the administration in Major Dhunjibhoy's absences. By order of the Government of Bihar and Orissa (Ministry of Local Self-Government), G. E. OWEN, Secretary to Government.
