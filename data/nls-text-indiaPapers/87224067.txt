SEASON OF 1877-78. RETURNS OF VACCINATION FOR THE NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES. No. 327 OF 1878. FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT-GENERAL OF VACCINATION, NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH. DATED ALMORA, THE 1ST MAY, 1878. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit, for the information of His Honour the Lieute- nant-Governor, the returns of vaccination, North-Western Provinces, for the year 1877-78. 1. This year's report has been prepared in accordance with the new statements ordered by the Government of India. The statements are four in number. Statement No. I. shows the particulars of vaccinations in the North-Western Provinces during the year 1877-78. Statement No. II. shows the cost of the vaccine department. Statement No. III. shows dispensary vaccination. Statement No. IV. is comparative, showing the number of persons primarily vaccinated, and the number of those persons who were successfully vaccinated in each of the past ten years. I will deal first with the statements. STATEMENT No. I. A.( 2 ) C.( 3 ) N.( 4 ) AGRA AND MEERUT CIRCLE. In this circle there was an increase of two vaccinators paid out of local funds. Out of the total number vaccinated (230,149) there was an increase of 25,174 (all being primary cases), and the percentage of success in primary cases was increased by .6. Dr. Pringle supplied during the season 3,000 tubes of lymph and many hundreds of loaded points from Tehri, Garhwál, and Dehra Dún. There was a considerable epidemic of small-pox throughout the Meerut circle during the cold season, but owing to the excellent arrangements made last year and during the present season by Dr. Pringle, the city and cantonment of Meerut escaped almost entirely. The progress of vaccination in the Agra and Meerut circle is very satisfactory, and thanks are due both to Dr. Pringle and his Deputy Superintendent, Mír Ahmad Hasan, for their exertions. The undermentioned native gentlemen are mentioned by Dr. Pringle as con- spicuous for the interest they have taken in the promotion of vaccination :( 5 ) &quot; He has great influence among the natives everywhere, and especially among the rich merchants in the great cities of Benares and Grorakhpur. I attended along with him two large public meetings in these two cities. The meetings were attended in each case by all the leading people of the places. &quot; Pandit Bishan Datt delivered addresses on vaccination which were listened to with the deepest attention. &quot; In consequence of these meetings the cause of vaccination has made, and is making, wonderful progress in these two cities and in the country round.&quot; I myself can bear testimony to the excellent work done by the Deputy Superinten- dent, Pandit Bishan Datt. He is a Kumaun Brahmin, and has great influence with the high caste classes of the Benares division. The number of high caste Hindus who have accepted vaccination has risen this year from 12,275 to 17,357. Pandit Bishan Datt has written a treatise on vaccination which has been well received by all classes and been very useful in promoting vaccination. He particularly mentions the undermentioned native gentlemen as having assisted him much in forward- ing vaccination:( 6 ) A.( 7 ) Agra Circle of Superintendence 1 Muttra ... 887,689 551 15 9,856 8,938 18,294 1,218.6 18,294 7,210 9,003 16,213 ... ... 92.8 ... 18.2 12,278 13.8 929.3 1.15 2 Agra ... 1,096,367 575 19 9,789 9,250 19,039 1,002.0 19,039 8,433 9,033 17,466 ... ... 95.3 ... 15.9 11,943.0 10.8 996.2 0.98 3 Farukhabad ... 918,850 527 12 6,826 6,094 12,920 1,076.0 12,920 5,245 7,146 12,391 ... ... 97.6 ... 13.4 7,058.1 7.6 1,129.1 1.27 4 Mainpuri ... 765,845 452 8 5,754 5,772 11,526 1.440.6 11,526 5.503 5,000 10,503 ... ... 94.1 ... 13.7 8,332.3 10.8 879.1 1.13 5 Etáwah ... 668,641 395 8 5,985 5,458 11.443 1,430.3 11,443 4,620 6,100 10,720 ... ... 95.0 ... 16.0 8,337.0 12.4 919.1 1.72 6 Etah ... 708,527 465 6 5,373 4,294 9,667 1,611.1 8,667 4,570 4,000 8,570 ... ... 95.0 ... 12.1 5,667.0 8.0 1,200.4 2.10 Total of Circle ... 5.040,919 496 68 48,083 39,806 82,889 1,229.5 82,889 35,581 40,282 75,863 ... ... 94.5 ... 14.5 8,935.5 10.3 1,008.5 1.2 Allahabad Circle of Superin- tendence. 1 Cawnpore ... 1,155,439 495 24 17,882 15,677 33,559 1,116 31,992 8,198 16,923 25,121 1,567 891 86.7 72.4 21.7 20,236 17.5 2,848 2.46 2 Fatehpur ... 663,815 419 14 7,54 4 8,295 15,839 1,131 15,806 3,490 7,470 10,960 33 18 81.0 66.6 16.5 6,010 9.0 886 1.33 3 Bánda ... 697,611 240 17 5,892 6,095 11,987 705 10,793 4,505 4,369 8,874 194 114 86.0 69.5 12.7 5,034 7.2 1,275 1.83 4 Allahabad ... 1,394,245 508 17 6,533 6,042 12,675 739 11,840 3,322 5,666 8,987 735 406 85.8 69.4 6.4 5,945 4.2 1,886 1.35 5 Hamirpur ... 529,137 232 12 6,590 6,934 13,524 1,127 13,863 4,451 5,625 10,076 161 93 84.7 66.0 19.0 6,938 18.1 857 1.62 6 Jaunpur ... 1,025,869 659 11 6,116 4,521 10,637 967 10,388 748 7,615 8,363 294 68 86.6 38.9 8.1 6,787 6.6 970 0.95 Total of Circle ... 5,466,116 407 95 50,557 47,564 98,121 1,032 95,182 24,855 47,526 72,381 2,939 1,590 85.4 68.5 13.2 50,970 9.3 8,729 1.59 Jhánsi Circle of Superinten- dence. 1 Jhánsi ... 317,735 203 9 7,993 6,834 14,827 1,647 14,808 3,026 8,337 11,368 19 8 87.8 100. 35.7 3,297 10.3 593 1.87 2 Jalaun ... 404,384 260 18 9,383 9,311 18,694 1,438 18,693 6,852 8.69 15,471 1 1 88.8 100. 38.2 9,232 22.8 394 0.97 3 Lalitpur ... 212,628 109 6 3,544 3,474 7,018 1,169 7,004 3,562 2,027 5,689 14 12 87.8 100. 26.2 2,676 12.5 1,055 4.96 Total of Circle ... 834,747 185 28 20,920 19,619 40,539 1,447 40,505 13,440 18,983 32,423 34 21 88 3 100. 34.6 15,204 16.2 2,043 2.18 Benares Circle of Superinten- dence, 1 Gorakhpur ... 2,019,350 441 19 12,601 12,110 24,711 1,800.57 24.639 2,720 19,223 21,943 72 70 93.59 97.22 10.901 11,644 5.77 6,240 3.09 2 Basti ... 1,472,994 528 12 5,137 5,848 10,985 901.25 10,900 1,886 8,242 10,128 85 42 97.27 61.76 6.904 5,864 3.98 3,152 2.14 3 Azamgarh ... 1,531,410 597 15 7,816 7,075 14,891 926.06 14,802 1,198 12,307 13,505 89 41 94.94 46.07 8.84 6,625 6.27 2,496 1.63 4 Mirzapur ... 1,015,293 195 13 7,374 7,054 14,428 1,109.84 14,255 1,236 11,807 13,043 173 116 94.94 70.78 12.96 6,625 6.52 1,107 1.09 5 Benares ... 793,699 797 14 8,809 7,566 16,375 1,169.64 16,062 1,790 13,348 15,188 313 161 95.79 56.69 19.28 7,496 9.44 334 0.42 6 Gházipur ... 1,345,401 621 19 10,013 9,408 19,421 1,022.16 19,200 2,701 15,023 17,724 221 171 95.17 85.07 17.62 15,324 11.39 1,790 1.33 Total of Circle ... 8,178,147 446 92 51,750 49,061 100,811 1,095.77 99,858 11,531 79,950 91,481 953 60 94.98 68.45 11.25 56,541 6.91 15,119 1.85 Grand Total of the N.-W.

FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT-GENERAL OF VACCINATION, NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH. DATED ALMORA, THE 1ST MAY, 1878. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit, for the information of His Honour the Lieutenant- Governor, the returns of vaccination for the province of Oudh for the year 1877-78. 1. This year's report has been prepared in accordance with the new statements ordered by the Government of India. The statements are four in number :( 2 ) F.( 3 ) In the year 1877 the number successfully vaccinated was 32,406, the strength of the vaccinators being 66. GENERAL REMARKS. The vaccination in this province is in a very backward condition, but I have every reason to believe that the new Deputy Superintendent, Babu Bandedin, will gradually bring it up to the standard of the North-Western Provinces. Babu Bandedin has had long experience in Rohilkhand (which division he has superintended most successfully since 1854), and will bring his great influence to bear upon the talukdars and native gentlemen in inducing them to interest themselves in introducing vaccination amongst their tenants. More native superintendents are required for the province and more vaccinators, but I refrain from asking for any increase this year, on financial grounds. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, F. PEARSON, SURGEON-MAJOR, Supdt.- General of Vaccination, N.-W. P. and Oudh.

ORDERS OF GOVERNMENT. No. 505A. OF 1878. FROM THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, N.-W. PROVINCES AND OUDH, To THE SUPDT.-GENL. OF VACCINATION, N.-W. PROVINCES AND OUDH. DATED NAINI TAL, THE 24TH JUNE, 1878. SIR, DICAL DEPARTMENT. I AM directed to acknowledge your letters Nos. 327 and 328, dated the 1st May last, submitting the reports on vaccination in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh for the year 1877-78, and in reply to communicate the following remarks and orders. 2. You have submitted separate returns for Oudh and for the North-Western Provinces, and also separate reports on the progress of vaccination in the two provinces. I am to request that in future the statements be combined, and but one report submitted. The statistics of the year are shown in the new forms prescribed by the Government of India. One of the main differences between the old and the new forms is that, in the latter, caste statistics have been omitted. The new forms also are more compact and convenient. 3. Returns for the North- Western Provinces.( 2 ) of vaccination to the provincial revenues was Rs. 15,000 less than in the previous year, and in the present state of the finances this is an import- ant consideration. 4. The average cost of each successful case has considerably fallen, ( 3 ) The death-rate is the highest in the districts in which vaccination has been most attended to. The natural inference is that in these localities the climatic conditions are peculiarly favorable to the disease, and that the vaccinators have followed in its wake. I am to point out that state- ment No. I., from which these figures are taken, has been inaccurately compiled. The totals of columns 17 and 19 for the Meerut Circle should be 87,109.7 and 8,235.2 instead of 12,444 and 1,372.5 respectively, and those for the Agra Circle, 53,615.4 and 6,053.2 instead of 8,935.5 and 1,008.5. 5. The excellent arrangements made by Dr. Pringle in the city and cantonment of Meerut, by which they escaped what threatened to be an epidemic of small-pox, are noticed with approval by His Honor. Sir George Couper is also glad to learn that the long continued exertions of the Judge of the Small Couse Court, Benares, and of Pandit Bishen Dat, are so warmly spoken of by Dr. Watson. 6. Nothing is said about inoculation, or whether the popular pre- judices in its favor are on the wane. But it may here be noticed as a sign of better things that several municipal committees have unanimously passed bye-laws, by which the practice of inoculation has been made a public nuisance within municipal limits. 7. Returns for Oudh.( 4 ) 8. In conclusion, I am to remark that in the current year the mor- tuary statistics show that small-pox has been epidemic and very fatal. They forcibly illustrate how great a scourge the disease is, and how im- portant it is to guard the population from its ravages. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, C. ROBERTSON, Secy. to Govt., N.- W. P. and Oudh.

Appendix A.ANNUAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH, For the year 1889-90. First separate report on vaccination. HITHERTO the annual statistical returns and notes on vaccination have been included in the sanitary report; but under the orders of Go- vernment of India, Home Department, Sanitary, No. 316, dated 7th October 1889, the annual report on vaccination is for the first time submitted separately. Area of administration and operation. 2. The operations of the Vaccination Department extend over the whole adminis- trative area of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh. Acts in force. 3. The Vaccination Act (XIII of 1880) is in force in only a few limited areas : and the practice of inoculation is prohibited in only those localities to which Act XXIV of 1868 and Act XIII of 1880 have been extended. Vaccination establish- ment. 4. The vaccination establishment consists of an administrative officer, the Sanitary Commissioner, three Superintendents, Deputy Sanitary Com- missioners, who combine sanitary with vaccination duties, seven Deputy Superintendents, 25 first class Native Superintendents, 25 second class Native Superintendents, 698 vaccinators, including vaccinators of all classes, whether paid from district municipal and town funds or by contributions from private sources, and there are besides 43 paid apprentices. The average number of vaccinators employed increased from 677 in 1888-89 to 698 as noted. Vaccination circles and areas of superintendence. 5. There are three circles of superintendence, each in charge of a Commissioned Medical Officer, the first with headquarters at Meerut, the second with headquarters at Lucknow and the 3rd with head quarters at Allahabad. The annexed map shows the extent of the circles of adminis- tration and indicates the limited area in which the Vaccination Act is in force. The 1st Circle embraces 13 west and south-western districts and the hill tract north of Dehra Dún; the 2nd Circle 21 chiefly the Central and Oudh districts, including the Kumaun hill tracts; the 3rd Circle, 17 east and south-eastern districts, also the districts of the Jhánsi Division and the hill tract of Garhwál. Distribution statement. 6. The following distribution statement shows the estab- lishment of each circle :( 2 ) contributions from private sources ; and the sums actually disbursed and the expenditure in 1888-89 and 1889-90 under different heads were as follows :( 3 ) 46.25 in the first period and 47.95 in the second period. The percentage of successful primary operations in adult life to operations in the period of childhood is 5.80. These percentages stand in marked contrast to those calculated on the number of vaccinations performed in Lower Bengal, and the percentages of successful operations in that pro- vince in 1888-89 were as follows :( 4 ) It is thus seen that the average number of births registered since the last census was 1,741,354, and that an average of only 293,399 children under one year of age, or about 16.84 per cent. of the children born, were successfully vaccinated. At the second age period the average number was 295,766, or about 16.98 per cent., and at all ages the number successfully vaccinated was 625,152, or about 35.90 per cent. of the average number representing births. Disparity of vaccination statistics of India and England. 12. In Scotland, in 1888, there were 124,467 children born, and of these ( 5 ) The following statement shows the results of inspections by the Deputy Sanitary- Commissioners, Deputy Superintendents and Native Superintendents of Vaccination:( 6 ) Animal lymph. 18. Animal lymph depôts on a small scale were established at Hardoi, Nawáb- ganj, Unao and Lalitpur; and at the Lucknow depôt opera- tions were carried on on a more extensive scale than formerly. The Lucknow depôt is supported solely by the Municipality, but demands were made on it for the supply of lymph to the district generally. A report on the subject of the general extension of operations by the use of animal lymph, and the formation of central animal vaccine depôts, was submitted to Government before operations of 1889-90 were begun. Localities in which the Vaccination Act is in force. 19. The following list shows the places where the Vacci- nation Act (XIII of 1880) is in force with the number and date of the notification extending the Act to the localities named :DIAGRAM, illustrating the death-rate from Small-pox in the North Western Provinces and Oudh, as compared with the actual and average death-rate from Small-pox in England

The resist- ance to the operation is best overcome by getting influential natives to take and main- tain a personal interest in vaccination; and the Vaccination Act should be extended to all Municipalities. All Government servants and the members of their families should be required to submit to the operation; and the adoption by District Boards and by Municipalities of a rule limiting the attendance at all or certain schools to children protected against small-pox will tend to assist the spread of vaccination and lessen the chance of the epidemic extension of small-pox from school centres. Licensed vaccinators. 23. The system of licensing vaccinators has not been tried in the eastern districts where inoculation still obtains. In Lower Bengal three-fourths of the total number of operations are performed by licensed men, who are permitted to realize a fee of two annas for each operation, and of the total number of persons, 17,58,354, vaccinated in 1888-89, the large number of 1,324,434 operations were by licensed men against 433,920 by paid vaccinators. Conduct of subordinates. 24. Pandit Bishen Dat, the Deputy Superintendent of the Oudh Division, is spe- cially mentioned for efficiency in the discharge of his duties, and he superintended the collection of lymph in Kumaun with marked ability and care. The Deputy Superintendent of Agra Division, Munshi. Wazir Ali, is able and intelligent, and Munshi Ali Hasan and Ali Mirza Beg, the Deputy Superintendents of Benares and Allahabad Divisions, deserve mention for the excellent work performed by them. The Native Superintendent of Gorakhpur, Munshi Muhammad Hasan, has worked with commendable zeal, as also Munshi Abdul Latif of Azamgarh. There was a want of energy on the part of some of the vaccinators of the 1st Circle, especially in the Meerut Division. As a body the vaccinators of the Oudh Division have worked well. The same remark applies to some extent to the vaccinators of the 3rd Circle. The usual rewards will be distributed to those vaccinators who have done exceptionally good work. 25. Finally, the general efficiency of the Department is shown by the satisfactory and progressive results of the year's operations. NAINI TAL : G. HUTCHESON, M.D., SURGEON-MAJOR, 7th June 1890.

ORDERS OF GOVERNMENT. No. 214/V( 2 ) would have been expected, a decline in mortality from small-pox appears, so far as the results of registration in these Provinces can be trusted, to have followed the introduction of vaccination. But the statistics are too unreliable to allow of any confident conclusions being drawn. In Oudh, it will be observed, that both the number of successful primary vaccinations and deaths from small-pox have decreased in the second quinquennial period. The Lieutenant-Governor hopes that District Officers will bring home to the attention of the members of all Muni- cipal and District Boards the remarks in your 20th and succeeding para- graphs on the efficacy of vaccination in reducing the mortality from small-pox.

Active steps were taken last year to impress upon District Officers and upon Talúqdárs and influential landholders in Oudh the advantages of vaccination and the necessity for furthering its spread, especially in those districts in which either apathy or hostility existed. The Lieu- tenant-Governor is glad to see that a considerable advance has been made, and that during 1889-90 there was an increase of 32,823 operations, of which 9,137 belonged to the Hardoi district, in which the Lieutenant- G-ovemor is glad to find that Colonel Pitcher and Dr. McReddie have made unremitting efforts to aid and encourage the work of the Depart- ment.

The reason of this has not been explained for either year, and should be furnished. It is also observed that there has been laxity of supervision in this Circle for the past two seasons, and it should be stated who is responsible for this. The statement given in paragraph 16 of your report shows the following result as regards inspections:( 5 ) A reference to the mortuary statistics shows that in several instances this has been accompanied by an increase in deaths from small-pox. The dis- trict authorities concerned will have their attention called to this. The low ratios per mille of population successfully vaccinated in the districts of Basti and Jaunpur (8.59 and 8. respectively) were also noticed in last year's Reviéw, and you were asked to enquire into it. No explanation has been received. The figures for the present year (9.52 and 916) show a slight improvement, hut in these districts and in Azamgarh (11.40), they are still considerably below the average ratio for the Circle (16.32). 10. District Officers can ensure, if they attend to the matter, most material success in vaccine operations. A little countenance given to the vaccinators when in camp; a little attention shown to the Native Superintendents, and a few words to landlords and the leading agriculturists will command constant progress, and will help rapidly to remove what remains of the prejudices against vaccination. There is absolutely no reason hut the apathy of officials and operators for a falling off of the number of vaccine operations in any district in the North-Western Provinces. 11. The total expenditure on vaccination was in 1889-90 Rs. 1,30,671-10-0 against Rs. 1,31,960-13-9 in the former year. The cost of each successful operation fell from three annas one pie to two annas 11 pies. The figures for each Circle for the past triennial period are 1887-88. 1888-89. 1889-90. Rs. a. p. Rs. a. p.

ANNUAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH, FOR THE YEAR 1890-91. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] ALLAHABAD: NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH GOVERNMENT PRESS. 1891.
ANNUAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH, FOR THE YEAR 1890-91. Notes on the operations of the year. The first triennial report was submitted last year, and the following brief notes on the operations of 1890-91 are recorded with reference to, and in explanation of, the statistical statements in the appendix. Distribution of establishment. 2. The following statement shows the distribution of the establishment of each circle :( 2 ) of 136,949 in the number of successful primary operations, a rise of 173 in the average number of operations performed by each vaccinator, and an addition of 3.39 to the number of persons relatively to the population protected by vaccination. Vaccination according to age. 6. It is satisfactory to note also, that the number of successful primary operations among children, under one year of age, rose from 323,922 in the previous to 386,293, and among children over one and under six years of age from 335,856 to 388,703. The results indicate that the standard of operations, among the infantile community, was not lessened by the rapid extension of operations. Vaccination in proportion to births. 7. The percentage of successful primary operations, among children under one year of age, was 22.06, among children over one and under six years, 22.20, and the percentage of all ages 47.82, as compared with 19.88, 20.61 and 42.99 in 1889-90, and 16.84, 16.98 and 35.90, the average percentages of the previous nine years. Operations in the 1st circle. 8. There was an increase of 50,459 operations in the 1st Circle, and the number of successful primary operations rose from 224,116 in 1889-90 to 248,041, or an increase of 23,925. Of 20,817 cases of re-vaccination, 8,866 were recorded as successful, and the result of this important series of cases has proved the necessity for re-establishing re-vaccination opera- tions in this Circle. The increase in the number of successful primary operations extend- ed to all districts, although the rise was slight in the Meerut, Dehra Dún, Mainpuri and Farukhabad districts. Operations in the 2nd Circle. 9. The increase of operations in the 2nd Circle amounted to a total of 86,433 and there were 67,136 successful cases of primary vac- cination over the number recorded in the previous year. The greatest increase in successful primary operations occurred in the Sultanpur, Hardoi, Bara Banki and Lucknow districts. There was a very slight falling-off in the number of successful cases of primary vaccination in the Kumaun hills, Tarái par- ganas, Bijnor district and Kumaun Bhábar. The number of persons successfully vac- cinated per 1,000 of the population is still low in some of the Oudh districts, but the lowest number, 5.41, in Kheri, compares very favourably with 2.95 as recorded against Sitapur, 3.34 against Gonda, 3.79 Kheri, 4.17 Partabgarh, 5.11 Rae Bareli, and 5.25 Fyzabad, in the previous year. The very favourable results in the Sultanpur district were in a great measure due to the vigorous effort made by the Deputy Commissioner, P. J. White, Esq., to extend vaccination to all parts of his district. Operations in the 3rd circle. 10. There was an increase of 51,520 in the operations of the 3rd Circle. The greatest increase, 24,997, in the number of successful primary operations was recorded in the Basti district, where the work was carried on with the assistance of the principal Zamindárs on a special sys- tem devised by T. R. Wyer, Esq., C.S., the Collector and Magistrate of the district. The result of Mr. Wyer's efforts was a very great increase in the number of successful cases and a great addition to the total of protected persons in the district, and the number of protected persons rose from 7.38 per 1,000 of the population in the previous year to 24.86 in 1890-91. Under this system local men are appointed to assist and work with Government vaccinators. &quot;These local men are selected from the higher castes, and are, as a rule, supplied gratis by influential Zamíndárs or by Court of Wards' Estates, a small gratuity or monthly salary being sufficient to obtain the services of men of good character and some position in the locality.&quot; The district of Gházipur shows an increase of 4,690 in the successful cases of primary vaccination, Gorakhpur 3,718, Jaunpur 3,562, and Azamgarh 3,188; while Jhánsi, Bánda and Fatehpur show a slight increase. Inspection of operations. 11. The inspections of the Sanitary Commissioner were carried out in all districts visited with a view to ascertain the qualification and fitness of native Superintendents, and to test the quality of the work of the subordinate vaccinators. The results of inspections
( 3 ) by Deputy Sanitary Commissioners, Deputy Superintendents and native Superinten- dents of Vaccination are shown in the following statement:( 4 ) Before, during and after the operation the calf, besides being well housed and fed, should be kept in the best possible sanitary condition and must be seen daily by the Civil Surgeon, who may, as at Hardoi, Gonda, Unao, &c., find it convenient to have the depôt placed near the dispensary. Localities in which the Vaccination Act is in force. 14. The Vaccination Act (XIII of 1880) was in force in only three municipalities at the close of the previous vaccination season, but since then the Act has been extended to 18 other municipalities, and many more have applied to Government for the necessary sanction to extend the Act within their own limits. The Meerut, Benares, Agra and Cawnpore Cantonments, and the Civil Station and Sádr Bázar of Cawnpore are also protected by the Act. Vaccination and small-pox. 15. It has been noted in the Sanitary Report of the Province that there has been no return to the very high recurring death-rates from small-pox of previous years. The record shows that there was exceptional mortality from small-pox every fourth and fifth year in former times, but that since the epidemic of 1883 and 1884 the recurrence of the usually severe epidemic of small-pox has been either greatly retarded or prevented, as the fourth and fifth years of recurring epidemics are now represented by a death-rate of .5 and 1.1 instead of 2.8 and 2.5, as in 1873 and 1874, 3.9 and 1.7, as in 1878 and 1879, and 3.1 and 4.5, as in 1883 and 1884. In other words, the total quinquennial death-rate from 1870 to 1874 was 8.4, from 1875 to 1879,8.0, from 1880 to 1884, 8.6, and from 1885 to 1889, 2.2, which, including the rate of' 1890, a sixth year, amounts to only 3.4 as compared with the high figures of former periods. The retardation of epidemic small-pox is thus indicated, and there is evidence that the incidence of small-pox in a severely epidemic form has been lessened in recent as compared with former years. Diagrams illustrating the incidence of small-pox in the North-Western Provin- ces and Oudh, and in the chief city of the Province. 16. The following diagrams illustrate the death-rate from small-pox in these Pro- vinces, as compared with the actual, and the average, death-rate from small-pox in England; and the death- rate from the disease in the city of Lucknow as compared with the actual, and average, death-rate from small-pox in London.

( 5 ) Extension of vaccination. 17. The extension of operations has been very marked during the past season; and the breaking down of opposition in Oudh and else- where, and the action taken by municipalities in favouring the introduction of Vaccination into municipal areas, are the chief features of the year. Mr. Mulock, the Deputy Commissioner of Lucknow, whose efforts in the cause of vaccination have been conspicuous and untiring, is of opinion that all direct opposition to vaccination within his jurisdiction has almost altogether dis- appeared, and that it will soon be possible to extend the operation to every child in the Lucknow district. The only need is an abundant supply of pure animal lymph to enable operations to be carried on on a large scale whenever necessary, and when the supply of humanised lymph is restricted by the prejudice of the people against the use of their children as vaccinifers. Inoculation of small-pox in the eastern districts. 18. An endeavour has been made to obtain information as to the extent and preva- lence of inoculation in the districts bordering on Bengal, but beyond the fact that the system obtains to some extent no exact data are available. It may be soon considered necessary to prohibit the practice, and the introduction of the Vaccination Act into the town of Ballia, and its probable extension to other municipalities in the eastern districts may lead to reform in this respect, either by the direct prohibition of inoculation, or the extension of the Vaccination Act after a time to districts, where the practice of inocula- tion is proved to exist. Conduct of subordinates. 19. A few of the senior subordinates obstruct progress, and any extension of opera- tions is interpreted by them as more and increasing labour and greater responsibility. The Deputy and native Superintendents of Vaccination, however, and the general body of vaccinators have with a few exceptions worked with zeal and intelligence. 20. The record of the work accomplished during the year is very satisfactory, and the general results of the year's operations show marked and undoubted progress. NAINI TAL : G.

ORDERS OF GOVERNMENT. No. 470/V( 2 ) 3. In G. O. No. 283/V( 3 ) an example of any of your senior subordinates who obstruct the pro- gress of vaccination on account of the greater labour which it entails on them, as is said in paragraph 19 of your report to be the case in a few instances. You must be careful also to keep your establishment abreast of the very decided increase in the applications for vaccination which has taken place in these Provinces of late years. 6. Your remarks on the use of animal lymph have been read with interest; its use is commoner in Oudh than in the North- West Provinces, seven districts in Oudh having made arrangements to secure a supply against one, Lalitpur, in the North-West Provinces. The Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Commissioner presumes that the superintendence of the Civil Surgeon is sufficient to secure the veterin- ary examination of the animals used, which you say is indispensable. 7. In consequence of the action taken by Government last year in drawing the attention of municipalities to the advantages of the Vaccination Act, 59 Municipalities have, up to the present time, applied for the extension of the Act, which has actually been declared in force in 42 of those which have made applications. Twenty have not yet intimated their views : and 26 have decided to take no action. 8. In conclusion I am to express the satisfaction of His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Commissioner at the substantial progress made during the year ; his thanks are especially due to Colonel Pitcher, Messrs. P. J. White, Wyer, Mulock, and McReddie, whose names have been prominently mentioned by you. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, W. C. BENETT, Secy. to Govt., N.- W. P. and Oudh.

It is satisfactory to note not only an increase in the total number vaccinated, but also a marked increase in the number of successful cases and a considerable addition to the ratio of the number of persons protected by vaccination. Vaccination according to age. 6. The number of successful primary operations among children under one year of age was 378,512 against 3S6,293 and 323,922 in 1890-91 and 1889-90 respectively. There were 7,781 fewer successful primary vaccinations among infants than in the previous year ; but, as has been shown elsewhere, the year 1891 was marked by a very low birth-rate, and the proportion of infants vaccinated was actually greater in the year under review. The standard of operations among children from birth to under six years of age was higher, as shown by an increase in the total successful primary operations among young children, of 36,293. Vaccination in proportion to births. 7. The percentage of successful primary .operations among infants to the total births was 24.26 as compared with 22.06 in 1890-91. Operations in the 1st circle. 8. The operations in the 1st circle numbered 303.679, against 300,039 in the previous year, and there was a decrease of 2,295 in the number of successful primary operations. There was a total of 23,838 cases of re-vaccination, of which 9,618 were recorded as successful and the operation of re-vaccination has thus been fully maintained as in the previous year. A slight decrease in the number of successful primary opera- tions was recorded in the districts of Saháranpur, Muzsffarnagar, Etáwah and Etah ; and in the native state of Tehri Garhwál the decrease was very marked, there being only 6,083 successful primary operations as compared with 9,347 in the previous year. Operations in the 2nd circle. 9. There was an increase in the total operations in the 2nd circle of 69,878, and of 53,909 in the number of successful primary vac- cinations. The increase in the successful primary cases was most marked in the districts of Bara Banki and Sitapur, in which the num- bers rose from 12,159 to 31,450 and from 5,955 to 18,968 respectively, or a total in- crease in these two districts of 32,304 successful operations. The districts showing the greatest number of persons successfully vaccinated proportionately to population during the year were Almora 35.17, Naini Tal 31.93, Bijnor 28.13, Bara Banki 27.87, Sultanpur 26.07, Moradabad 24.73, Hardoi 23.80, Pilibhít 21.51, Bareilly 20.01, Lucknow 19.73, Sháhjahánpur 19.48, all showing a proportion above the provincial average. The proportion of persons protected to population is very small in Kheri 6.17, Rae Barcli 7.89, Unao 8.34, Fyzabad 8.74, Gonda 8.93, Partábgarh 10.51, Bah- raieh 11.15. Operations in the 3rd circle. 10. Operations in the 3rd circle decreased by 2,706, and there were 11,611 fewer successful primary cases than in the previous year. There was a decrease of 11,186 successful primary operations in the Basti district alone and of 7,292 in the Gorakhpur district. The falling off in the Basti district was due in great part to the withdrawal of the extra local vaccination staff of the previous year, as it was deemed advisable to carry on the operation with a permanent and experienced class of operators only. Laxity of super- vision accounts for the falling off in the Gorakhpur district.
( 3 ) Inspection of operations. 11. The results of inspection of the operations of the year are shown in the follow- ing table. An extra column has been added which indicates the proportion per cent. of successful cases actually verified by inspections to the total number of operations entered as successful. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Number of inspecting officers. Number of villa- ges visited by( 4 ) The Deputy Superintendent of Vaccination, Allahabad Division, Ali Mirza, was conspicuous in his efforts to establish efficient vaccination throughout his Division at an early period ;and much good work had been accomplished in Cawnpore and else- where before the end of October. The lymph supply in the 1st Circle was fully maintained throughout the season, and the vesicle was, as in other ciroles, established in some districts earlier than usual. In the 2nd Circle the inspections of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner were limited to the Rohilkhand Division. He reports &quot; I found the percentage of success to be 94.38, and as most of the children showed good marks on both arms, was well satisfied with the character of the work.&quot; The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner of the 3rd Circle reports that &quot; regular work was carried on with human lymph, but if it failed from any reason animal lymph was supplied to replenish stock, though this was rarely required. Many hundred children were examined during, and at various periods after, the operation. In this way the work of every day vaccination and its results could be correctly judged under the varying conditions of different operators in different localities. As a result I think I can express a decided opinion, that as a rule the lymph was good, the cases were carefully selected, the operation was performed with care (efficiently and sufficiently), and with a fair average success, more especially in the Cawnpore, Benares, Gházipur, and Jaunpur districts.&quot; Animal lymph. 14. Animal lymph operations were carried on at Lucknow, Hardoi, and Gonda, and minor depôts maintained at Bara Banki, Unao, Par- tabgarh, Allahabad, Lalitpur and Sultánpur. The large depôt at Lucknow is supported by the Municipality, and the depôts at other stations for the most part by subscriptions. In Bara Banki, Taluqdar Shaikh Tasadduq Rasul Khan, of Jahangirabad, provided the means to promote vaccination among those who objected to the use of humanized lymph, and in the Gonda district several native gentlemen subscribed to the fund for the promotion of vaccination by animal lymph and the extension of operations generally. The extension of animal vaccine experiments is necessarily very gradual; and animal lymph depôts can only be recommended where the operations are thoroughly and systematically carried out, and every precaution as to the physical and sanitary condition of animals operated on rigidly enforced by the Civil Surgeon personally. In fact vaccination with animal lymph is not advisable, unless the strictest veterinary safeguards be adopted. Localities in which the Vaccination Act is in force. 15. At the close of the vaccination season of 1889-90 the Vaccination Act was in force in three municipalities only. In the following year the Act had been extended to 18, and it now applies to 65 municipalities. It is satisfactory to note that there have been no formal complaints lodged as to the working of, and the enforcement of bye-laws under, the Act. Vaccination and small-pox. 16. The death-rate from small-pox fell to 56 per 1,000 of the population, and the total deaths from 55,394 in 1890 to 26,355. The comparative immunity from small-pox in recent as compared with former years is still maintained, and the retardation of epidemic small pox, as indicated in last year's report, is still shown in the additional data of the year under report. Diagrams illustrating the incidence of small-pox in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh and in the chief city of the Province. 17. The following diagrams illustrate the death-rate from small-pox in these Prov- inces as compared with the actual, and the average death-rate from small-pox in England, and the death- rate from the disease in the city of Lucknow, as com- pared with the actual and average death-rate from small-pox in London.

( 5 ) Extension of vaccination. 18. The increase of operations in the 2nd Circle amounted to a total of 69,878, and the rise in the number of successful primary vaccinations was recorded chiefly in the districts of Oudh. The rapid extension of vaccination in the Bara Banki district was due solely to the zeal and activity shown by Colonel Grigg, the Deputy Commissioner. The comparatively high standard of operations yearly reached in the Hardoi district, and the successful results of the year's operations in the district of Sitapur, may be safely ascribed to Colonel Horsford's energy and initiation. The necessity for the extension of vaccination is often brought home to the most prejudiced native, and the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner of the 2nd Circle relates how two leading mahajans of Mullawan in Hardoi and Khairabad in Sitapur allowed their daughters to be vaccinated the season before last and concealed their sons. The sons died of small pox last year, while the daughters who had been vaccinated escaped. Both mahájans had every child of their families and attendants vaccinated this season. Inoculation of small-pox in the east- ern districts. 19. The evidence as to the extent and prevalence of inoculation in the districts bordering on Bengal is still scanty, but there is not the slightest doubt that the practice still obtains to a greater or less extent. Three inoculators at least from Lower Bengal endeavoured to practise their calling at the beginning of last season in the district of Jaunpur. The local authorities should be alive to the necessity of prohibiting inoculation in outlying tahsíls, and the subordinate officials might be held responsible for supplying accurate information regarding the men who find sufficient inducement and encouragement to undertake long and expensive journeys from another province to perpetuate a loath- some disease. The extension of the Vaccination Act to such tahsíls, and townships, where inoculation still obtains is advisable. Conduct of subordinates. 20. The Deputy Superintendents of Vaccination, Meerut, Oudh, Rohilkhand, and Allahabad have discharged their duties with intelli- gence, and the native Superintendents with few exceptions have worked with commendable zeal. The vaccination staff have on the whole worked well, and the punishment list was not a very large one. Marked progress in vaccination. 21. The general results of the season's operations are very satisfactory. Progress has been maintained, and the results compare favour- ably with those of the previous year. The extension of operations, by 32 per cent. in two seasons, indicates the zeal and energy which has characterized, and been instilled by the Government into, all classes concerned in vaccination in Oudh and the North-Western Provinces generally.

ORDERS OF GOVERNMENT. No. 386/V-231B OF 1892. FROM THE OFFG. SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, N.-W. Provinces and OUDH, To THE SANITARY COMMISSIONER, N.-W. PROVINCES AND OUDH. DATED NAINI TAL, THE 11TH AUGUST 1S92. SIR, SITATION DEPT. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt, on 18th July 1892, of your report on Vaccination for the year ending 31st March 1892. The triennial report is due next year. It is noticed that you have made use, in the returns, of the statistics of the recent census. 2. The chief figures showing the working of the Department in 1891-92. as compared with previous years, are as follows( 2 ) to be expected; but, seeing bow backward vaccination still is in these Provinces, it cannot be viewed with indifference. The vaccination staff, it is observed, only increased by 19 in 1891-92 as compared with 53 in the previous year, and there is a limit to the amount of work which one man can perform. It rests with you to arrange with District Boards and with municipalities for such increase from time to time to the number of vaccinators as may be necessary ; and you are requested to keep this prominently before those bodies. It is clear however that there is room for improvement in the amount of work accomplished by vaccinators in various districts. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator varies (excluding the hill districts) from 2,158.29 in Sultánpur to 750 in Rae Bareli. A cause which is said to have prejudicially affected the outturn of work was the low birth rate : the number of infants vaccinated fell from 386,293 to 378,512. The decline in the number of persons successfully vaccinated per mille of population is merely nominal, being due to the use of the figures of the 1891 census in calculating the ratio; thus you give 18.34 as the ratio for 1890-91 calculated on the population corrected for births and deaths. Since 1889-90 the number of persons vaccinated has increased by 323 per cent. 1890-91. 1891-92. Decrease.

The fourteen districts noted on the margin show a decrease in the total number of vaccina- tions as compared with the pre- vious year. No explanation is given of the large decrease in Almora and Naini Tal; that at Basti is attributed to a reduction of the staff by the withdrawal of some inexperienced vaccinators entertained locally; while at Gorakhpur, where the death rate per mille from small-pox (3.7l) was the highest in the Province, there is said to have been lax supervision. The seven districts noticed in the review on the report for last year all show, as will be seen from the figures on the margin, some slight improvement; but in many of these eastern districts, in Azamgarh, Jaunpur and Gorakhpur for exam- ple, and in Allahabad, Fatehpur and Bánda the business of vaccination still continues to be neglected by District Officers in spite of the instruc- tions of the Government. 5. In paragraph 11 you show in tabular form the results of inspection of operations during the year, the most noticeable feature of which is the comparatively small number of vaccinations tested by each Deputy Superintendent in the 3rd Circle (8,810) as compared with the figure for the other two circles (11,095 and 11,692). The Lieuten- ant-Governor and Chief Commissioner regrets to have to notice again that the outturn of work by Native Superintendents in the 2nd Circle
( 3 ) requires improvement, and your especial attention is called to this circle, which the Government trusts will not again be unfavourably noticed in the annual review of your operations. Explanation must be given of the small amount of inspecting work done by the Deputy Sanitary Com- missioner of the 2nd Circle. 6. The progress made in Oudh, to which in 1S89, and in subse- quent years, the Lieutenant-Governor has called urgent attention, and in which the number of persons vaccinated per 1,000 of population (14.74 still falls far short of the number in the United Provinces (19.48), is shown in the following table:( 4 ) 7. The total expenditure was Rs. 1,30,598 as compared with Rs. 1,34,361 in 1890-91, and the cost per successful operation declined from two annas and six pies to two annas and three pies. Municipal- ities are shown to have contributed Rs. 14,455 ; I am to inquire why the municipal expenditure entered in Statement No. II differs from that returned by the municipalities themselves (c( 5 ) year. It is noticeable that the death rate from small-pox per mille in some of the municipal towns in which the Act was not in force was the highest in the Provinces, viz., Gházipur 2.71, Moradabad 1.33, Sambhal and Nánpara 1.29,and Gorakhpur 96. In your next report you should especially examine the effect of the introduction of the Act, which will, practically speaking, date from the coming season, on the number of operations performed in the towns in which it is in force. Judging by the returns for municipalities, the average number of operations at present performed by municipal vaccinators in many of the towns is insufficient, falling far short of the provincial average. The working of the penal sections of the Act should also be reviewed. In addition to the muni- cipalities, the Vaccination Act is in force in the five cantonments of Meerut, Benares, Cawnpore, Agra and Allahabad: immediate steps will be taken to ascertain whether it cannot be extended to the remaining cantonments of the Provinces. 9. For the first time this year operations were carried on with no supply of lymph from England. The districts in Oudh which last year maintained depôts for the production of animal lymph con- tinue their arrangements this year, with the exception apparently of Bahraich, which is not mentioned in paragraph 14 of your report. An animal lymph depôt was started at Allahabad, making in all two districts in the North-Western Provinces and seven in Oudh where this system is in force. It is to be introduced in the current year in Sitapur. You personally inspected during the year the calf lymph operations at Gonda, and expressed yourself satisfied (in a separate report) with the arrangements made for the supply of healthy calves and with the efficacy of the process. The Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Commissioner fully concurs in the remarks made in paragraph 14 of your report as to the inexpediency of extending the system of vaccination with animal lymph except under the strictest precautions, and then only in those districts where insuperable objections exist to the usual arm-to-arm vaccination. I am to enquire if tubes have been supplied for the storage of animal lymph for use in the interior of a district, and, if not, how the lymph is preserved. You should also report whether in the districts in which the system is in force separate records are kept of vaccinations with animal lymph and with human lymph : so that the results of the two systems can be compared. It is understood that no district confines itself exclusively to vaccination with animal lymph. At Gonda the maintenance of a separate register was prescribed in July 1891, and I am to request you to report briefly the conclusions to be drawn from the record as to the final success of the experiment. 10. With reference to your remarks in paragraph 15 regarding the prevalence of inoculation, I am to point out that the practice is only prohibited by law and punishable in Kumaun, Garhwál and in those municipalities and cantonments to which the Vaccination Act may have been extended. That Act cannot be applied, as you suggest, to portions of a district such as a talisíl.
( 6 ) 11. I am to convey the thanks of the Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Commissioner to the officers mentioned in your report as having furthered the spread of vaccination; to the native gentlemen who, in some districts in Oudh, have subscribed liberally for the purpose ; and to you for your careful supervision of the operations of the Depart- ment for the past three years. During his term of office Sir Auckland Colvin has taken every opportunity of impressing upon District Officers, Municipal Boards and native gentlemen of position their duty as regards the extension of vaccination; and he has no doubt that if the attention of the Government is sustained for a limited period that the improvement, of which your successive reports bear evidence, will be more and more marked, and that the practice of vaccination will, in the course of no very long time, be far more generally accepted. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, W. H. L. IMPEY, Offg. Secy. to Govt., N.- W. P. and Oudh.

P. &Ouah.-April 93.ANNUAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH, For the year 1892-93. The triennial report. 1. This, the triennial report on vaccination, covers the years 1890-91, 1891-92, and 1892-93; and the extent and results of the operations within the period are summarized in the following pages. Area of administration and operation. 2. The whole of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, including the hill tracts of Kumaun and Garhwál under the jurisdic- tion of the Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Com- missioner, as also the Native State of Tehri Garhwál, are included in the area of administration and operations of the Vaccination Department. Vaccination in the Native State of Rámpur is still imperfectly controlled under State Agency, and no returns of any kind are submitted for record in the Provincial Reports, as in the case of the Native State of Tehri Garhwál. Division of the area into three circles of superintendence. 3. The area of operations is divided for the purposes of control into three circles, each in charge of a commissioned medical officer acting as Superintendent of Vaccination and Deputy Sanitary Commissioner. The 1st circle comprises the Agra and Meerut Divisions and includes the Native State of Tehri Garhwál; the 2nd circle, Almora and Naini Tal districts, the Rohilkhand Division and the Province of Oudh; and the 3rd circle, the Garhwál district, and the Allahabad, Benares and Gorakhpur Divisions. Vaccination establishment. 4. The Vaccination Department is under the control of the Sanitary Com- missioner acting as Superintendent-General of Vaccination, and the establishment consists of three Deputy Sanitary Commissioners acting as Superintendents of Vaccination, seven Deputy Superintendents; 25 first class Native Superintendents, 24 second class Native Superintendents ; 823 Vaccinators, including Vaccinators of all classes whether paid from Provincial, Municipal, Cantonment or Town Fund or by contributions from private sources, and there are besides 43 paid Apprentice Vaccinators. Changes in establishment since last triennial report. 5. Since the last triennial report was issued, there has been a decrease of one in the number of 2nd class native Superintendents, owing to the amalgamation of the Lalitpur with the Jhánsi district, and a considerable increase of 125 in the number of vaccinators. Sanction has been accorded to an increase by one in the number of Deputy Superintend- ents, so as to allow of one Deputy Superintendent for each of the Oudh Divisions. Distribution of establishment. 6. The distribution of the establishment of each circle is shown in the following statement:( 2 ) Circle. Superintendents (Deputy Sanitary Commissioners').

( 6 ) Operations in the 1st circle. 13. The total number of persons vaccinated in the 1st circle was 296,963, as com- pared with 303,679 in 1891-92, and 300,039 in 1890-91, and the successful primary operations numbered 255,726, against 245,746 in 1891-92, and 248,041 in 1890-91. Although the actual operations were less the number of successful vaccinations was greater than in former years, and Dr. Jameson reports that &quot; the quality of the work done this season was exceptionally good.&quot; Of the 12 districts of the 1st circle, five districts and the Native State Tehri show a slight increase, and six districts a considerable nerease in successful primary operations. There has thus been improvement in the record of successful primary vaccinations in every district of the circle except Agra. Excluding the hill tracts the number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population in the various districts ranged from 19.90 in Mainpuri and 20.05 in Farukhabad to the high figure of 30.46 in Muttra. The following table shows the in- crease or decrease in the number of successful primary vaccinations in the various districts of the 1st circle :( 7 ) The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population in the plains districts ranged from 9.96 in Gonda, and 10.78 in Unao, to 26.67 Bijnor and 28.74 in Hardoi; and it is satisfactory to note that a very high average is still main- tained in the latter district.

A paragraph was inserted in last year's report with reference to &quot; the distine- tion between good and imperfeet vaccination,&quot; and an endeavour might now be made to raise the stand- ard of operation in certain localities, by obtaining two or three well-marked cicatrices instead of the one ordinarily aceepted in India as successful vaccination. Dr. Griffith, Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, 3rd circle, advocates &quot; an increase in the area of vesi- culation in combination with an adequate number of insertions ;&quot; but it is not expe- dient to make much advance in this direction without due consideration of the prejudices of the people. He states &quot;during the year I inspected the work of 130 vaccinators to the extent of 11,070 cases with the following results, viz:( 11 ) Inspection of the vaccine vesicle at the beginning of the season. 24. Vaccination was fully established towards the middle of the month, and the general inspection of the vaccine vesicle towards the end of October showed that operations were fully and satisfactorily established somewhat earlier than in the previous season, and a fortnight earlier than in the former years. The following is a list of the applicants who were supplied with lymph, during the season 1892-93:( 12 ) unsuccessful, and the result of the experiments with animal lymph indicates the necessity of abolishing all calf lymph depôts wherever the supervision and control of operations are indifferent. The percentage of successful operations with calf lymph, to total successful primary vaccinations in the 2nd circle, was six only. In the 3rd circle, two calf lymph depôts were maintained during the season. One at Allahabad and the other at Lalitpur. Animal lymph was used in only 2.21 per cent. of the total number vaccinated in the 3rd circle and the best results were obtained from fresh lymph direct from the calf, 87.12 per cent. of the cases operated on in this way proving successful. The Allahabad calf lymph depôt was very efficiently managed by Dr. McConaghey, Civil Surgeon and Superintendent of Vaccination under the Vaccination Act. There were 5,713 successful primary vacci- nations, and 44 successful revaccinations with calf lymph, at the Allahabad Depôt during the season; and these results are due to the intelligent interest in the operations and care taken by the Civil Surgeon, and his subordinates throughout the season. At the Lalitpur Depôt, 812 primary vaccinations were performed with animal lymph, and the proportion of successful to the total number vaccinated was 93. The transmission of animal lymph to the interior of districts. 26. The transmission of animal lymph into the interior of districts can be readily effected in the form of lanoline vaccine paste, pro- perly stored and transmitted in sterilized tubes. Encouragement was given to the carrying on of operations in the interior of districts by calf lymph so transmitted, but the results were ineffective from want of intelligent interest and care. It is hoped that during the coming season the proper collection of calf lymph, the careful preparation of lanoline vaccine paste, and its transmission by post and otherwise in sterilized tubes on strictly antiseptic principles, will be accomplished by the Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioner of the 2nd Circle, where the extension of operations in some districts would be greatly facilitated by the use of preserved lymph, especially in localities where parents greatly object to the practice of taking lymph from the arms of their children. Arm-to-arm system of vaccination the safest and most effective in India, as in England. 27. There is reason to believe, however, that &quot;the extension of the use of pre- served lymph, as opposed to fresh lymph derived in the arm-to-arm system would lessen the amount of protection against small-pox which is at present afforded by vaccination,&quot; and while it is desirable to promote vaccination by preserved lymph in places and among communities where prejudice is persistent and strong, there is no doubt that vaccination by fresh lymph from arm-to-arm is the safest and best system of operation and affords the maximum protection against small-pox. Ope- rations with calf lymph, direct or with preserved animal vaccine, require the supervision of experts, and strict veterinary inspections and examination of the animals operated on are alsolutely necessary. Relative position of cicatrices indicat- ing nature of lymph used. 28. By a slight difference in the relative position of the vaccination cicatrices it should be readily determined whether humanized, calf or preserved lymph has beeen used in the operation. Vaccination and small-pox. 29. The number of fatalities from small-pox in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh in 1892 was 7,709, and the death-rate from this cause was only .16, the lowest ratio of mortality from this cause on record. The retardation of epidemic small-pox was noticed in previous reports, and it is satisfactory to be able to record a marked decline in the mortality from this loathsome and preventable disease. The average annual deaths per million from small-pox in London before the introduction of vaccination ranged from 5,020 to 4,170, and after the introduction of vaccination and the increase in successful vaccinations the average mortality fell from 2,040 in 1801-10 to four only in 1886-88.
( 13 ) A recent English return shows that the mortality from small-pox among the unvaccinated was 30 per cent., while among the vaccinated it was only 3.5 per cent. Temporary immunity from small-pox : need for further protection against epi- demics. 30. Considering the large number of persons still unprotected and in view of the occasional prevalence of epidemic small-pox locally and on the confines of the province, and the existing practice of inoculation in some of the eastern districts, the comparative and exceptional immunity from small-pox of the past few years can only be temporary. There is still much need, therefore, for the further extension of primary operations and revaccination, and for raising the standard of vaccination, to ensure more or less perfect and lasting protection against epidemics.

The following diagrams illustrate the death-rate from small-pox in these Provinces, as compared with the actual, and the average, death-rate from small-pox in England, and the death-rate from the disease in the city of Lucknow, as compared with the actual and average death-rate from small-pox in London. A diagram is added which shows the fluctua- tions in the provincial mortality, and the periods of epidemic influence of small- pox, during the past 22 years. 4

( 15 ) Localities in which the Vaccination Act is in force. 32. The Vaccination Act (XIII of 1880) is in force in all of the Municipalities of the United Provinces, with the following excep- tions, and in Cantonments, with the exception of Gorakhpur:( 16 ) Restriction of operations to certain seasons. 39. Operations in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, and the hill tracts were formerly restricted to well-defined periods. In the hill tracts, operations were confined to the period of seven months from October to April, and in the plains to the period from the 1st November to 25th March. In the Municipalities of the hill tracts operations are now legal throughout the year, and in the other Municipalities from 1st October to 31st March. In some parts of India, and in the Presidency towns of Calcutta and Bombay, operations are carried on throughout the year, and it seems advisable to extend vaccination to any period and season, during the occurrence of epidemic small-pox. The risk of untoward results following operations by experts in India in the hot weather has been much exaggerated, and is very slight, in view of the protection from a loathsome and very fatal disease. The arm-to-arm system of operation the readiest and safest. 40. The extension of vaccination by arm-to-arm operation is the safest and most effective method, and while it is necessary to encourage the cultivation of calf lymph at certain centres where sanitary and veterinary precautions can be rigorously carried out, the indiscriminate use of animal and preserved lymph should be discouraged. Calf lymph can only be effectively and safely used when perfectly fresh, or carefully preserved on antiseptic principles. Necessity of loyal co-operation of vac- cination staff with district officials. 41. The active assistance required of Deputy and Native Superintendents by the local authorities in extending operations has not in some instances been freely given, and loyal co-opera- tion has been markedly withheld in one or two cases. So much so that it is reported of one Native Superintendent that he gave the district officer a wide berth through- out the whole camping season, and it is further urged that he instigated his subordi- nates to keep aloof and hinder the work carried on by officers, whose sole desire was to extend and give an impetus to operations in backward localities. Conduct of subordinates. 42. The conduct of Deputy and Native Superintendents was generally satisfac- tory : two Native Superintendents were reduced in the 2nd and 3rd circles respectively for neglect of duty. In the 1st circle seven vaccinators, in the 2nd circle fourteen, and in the 3rd circle, seven were dismissed for irregularity of conduct, and falsification of their registers. The services of four apprentice vaccinators in the 1st circle, and three in the 2nd circle, were dispensed with for general inefficiency. Munshi Wazir Ali, Deputy Superintendent of the Agra Division, who is about to retire from the service, has as usual done good work and rendered faithful and loyal service. This Deputy Superintendent has maintained a high standard of vaccination in his division, while repressing and fearlessly exposing irregularities of conduct among subordinates. Prompt dismissal of subordinates tampering with records. 43. Much has been done within the past few years to rid the department of subordinates whose sole business was to submit favorable returns whether incorrect or otherwise; and no one has rendered greater assistance in detecting and promptly reporting existing evils than the Deputy Superintendent of the Agra Division, whose services deserve special mention and recognition. A rapid and steady advance in vaccina- tion and lessening opposition. 44. The progressive, and favorable results of the operations, of the past few years indicate a steady and rapid advance in vaccination in the United Provinces. In Oudh especially the advance has been considerable, and much of the prejudice against the operation which formerly existed has disappeared. In a few years hence it will be practicable, by careful and conciliatory methods, to vaccinate in the United Provinces up to the standard of the United Kingdom. NAINI TAL, Dated 17 th June 1893. G.

ORDERS OF GOVERNMENT. No. 374/V( 2 ) The number of persons successfully vaccinated in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh. has reached 20.34 per 1,000 of the population, which is still considerably below that of other Provinces : the advan- tages of vaccination are now far more widely appreciated by the people, and it is hoped that on an outbreak of small-pox the mortality will not again reach the high figures of 3.14 and 4.59 per mille as in the epidemics of 1883 and 1884. The ratio of deaths from this disease in 1892, .16 per 1,000 of the population, is the lowest on record: in the large towns there were 428 deaths only in all, and many of them, including Lucknow and Cawnpore, were entirely free from the disease. It is an encouraging sign that in towns where the proportion of persons successfully vaccinated nearly doubles that in districts, the death rate from small-pox in 1892 was .13 per mille as compared with .17 in the rural tracts. 3. The more important statistics of the year reported on are com- pared below with those of the previous year :( 3 ) Vaccination with a view to procuring the vaccination of all boys and girls of a certain age resident within municipalities or cantonments ; the Government would have been glad to have been assured that those duties had been properly carried out, and that the object of the Act had been duly attained. Were the registers of all children liable to be vaccinated properly maintained? Did the Superintendents of Vaccination examine these registers, and take steps to secure that no child remained unpro- tected ? Were certificates of vaccination regularly granted ? To what extent were notices and orders issued by Superintendents and Magistrates under sections 17 and 18 of the Act? On these and other points connected with the working of the Act and its result full information should be given in your next report. Judging from a comparison of the number of recorded births in municipalities in 1892 with the number of persons vaccinated during the year 1892-93, it would seem that in many cases the provisions of the Act were not properly carried into effect. Thus in the following municipalities at headquarters of districts( 4 ) bad, approaching nearest to that of the worst districts in Oudh. In Azamgarh a late Collector (Mr. Gill) reported that the obstinacy of the people and the inefficiency of the vaccinators had defeated his attempts at improvement. In Basti, which was unfavourably noticed last year in paragraph 4 of the review of your report, the ratio of successful operations per 1,000 of the population fell from 16.42 to 12.29, in spite of an increase of eight in the average number of vacci- nators employed, while the average number of operations performed by each vaccinator is one of the lowest in the Provinces. These results are discreditable to the Collector of the District and to the Department, and there should be no further delay in placing the operations in this district on a sound basis. District Magistrates of all grades have been again enjoined to use all proper influence in assisting vaccinators, and I am to ask for an explanation of the falling off in Basti, as that given in paragraph 15 of your report, which repeats a statement made in paragraph 10 of your report for 1891-92 and appears to be incon- sistent with the figures given in column 6 of Statement No. 1, is not understood. The six districts of Gonda, Unao, Bahraich, Kheri, Basti and Azamgarh above all require the special attention of yourself and the District Officers. Sir Charles Crosthwaite has decided to intro- duce the system in force in other Provinces of placing the Civil Surgeon in charge of district vaccination and requiring him to make short tours for the purpose of examining and testing the work of the vaccination staff, a measure which will, it is hoped, lead to improve- ment in the quality and outturn of the work. Professional supervision on the spot, more especially with reference to the supply and distri- bution of lymph, seems urgently required. His Honor regrets to observe that the falling off in Sultánpur and Bara Banki is attributed to a change of the District Officers, a matter to which the attention of the present Deputy Commissioners will be called. Mirzapur is another district in the North-Western Provinces which shows unsatis- factory results: the ratio of successful operations, which was below the average last year, has still further declined to 15.54 per mille. The districts of Allahabad, Jaunpur and Gorakhpur have improved, but the ratio of success in each is still low, especially in Gorakhpur (15.58). 5. It was observed in the review of your report for 1891-92 that arrangements should be made, when necessary, for duly increasing the number of vaccinators. Your returns show that in the districts of Dehra Dún, Bareilly, Basti, Mirzapur, Benares, Gházipur and Jhánsi, and in all the districts of Oudh, except Lucknow, Unao and Bahraich, additional vaccinators, who it is presumed were reliable and efficient operators, have been employed during the year 1892-93, raising the total number (by 54) to 824. With a supervising and controlling staff of 49 Native Superin- tendents, one to each district, seven Deputy Superintendents (increased recently to eight), and three Deputy Sanitary Commissioners who enjoy the assistance and co-operation of Commissioners and District officials, the results are below those attained in other Provinces where the staff and expenditure are on a less liberal scale( 5 ) Inspections in the 2nd Circle have improved, but the percentage of inspections to total number vaccinated is still low in some of the Oudh districts, and the backward district of Basti in the 3rd Circle did not receive sufficient attention from inspecting officers. 6. The question of the extension, so far as the law permits, of the vaccination season in municipalities, to which you refer in paragraph 39, will be separately considered. You advocate the performance of operations at any period and season of the year during the occurrence of epidemic small-pox. I am to enquire if the practice still prevails in Oudh of forbidding vaccinators to operate in villages in which small- pox is prevalent. The Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Commissioner observes with satisfaction the commendations you bestow on Maulvi Wazir Ali, Deputy Superintendent of the Agra Division, who is shortly to retire. I am to remind you of the standing orders which require that the names of district officials and others who specially exert themselves in carrying out the wishes of the Government in the matter of vaccination should be reported. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, W. H. L. IMPEY, Secy. to Govt., N.- W. P. and Oudh.

Appendix A.ANNUAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH, For the year 1893-94. Activity and marked progress in vac- cination. 1. The activity and progress which have characterized vaccine operations in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, during the past few years, are still the leading features of the annual report on vaccination. Great increase in the number prima- rily vaccinated. 2. The total number of persons primarily vaccinated in 1888-89, was 743,140, and since then the number has risen to 1,839,711. Besides, there has been substantial progress in extending operations in every direction where pre- judice and hostility to the operation were at one time rampant. The number of operations exceeds the number of infants living at the end of the year. 3. It is a satisfactory feature also of the operations that, in a province with a population of 47,146,327, the total number pri- marily vaccinated, now exceeds the average num- ber representing the infantile community. It was stated in last year's report that in a few years hence, it will be practicable by careful and conciliatory methods, to vaccinate in the United Provinces up to the Standard of the United Kingdom ; and this hope is becoming rapidly realized. Area of administration and operation. 4. The area of administration and operation remained the same as in previous years, and comprises the whole of the North- Western Provinces and Oudh and the Native State of Tehri Garhwál, but excludes the Native State of Rampur and the Kapurthala estate in Bahraich, where operations are carried on and controlled by native agency. Re-organisation of the Department by which Civil Surgeons are placed in Exe- cutive control of districts. 5. In accordance with the suggestions of the Government of India, the Vaccina- tion Department of the United Provinces was re-or- ganised with effect from the 1st October last, and Civil Surgeons were placed in executive control of operations within the limits of their respective districts. The new arrangement undoubtedly tends to secure adequate supervision of operations in the rural as well as the urban areas ; and it will be possible now to rigidly control the work of subordinates in every portion of the province. It is too early to estimate the effect of the changes in the department on the nature and quality of the work generally; but it has been noted by the Civil Surgeon of Saháranpur, that the work of the district had been previously carried on with such zeal and effici- ency that his inspections were all but a waste of time, and involved a serious absence from legitimate Medical, Surgical and other work at Headquarters. The change in executive control, however, as indicated in the Government Resolution, which forms Appendix D, will undoubtedly strengthen the hands of the department, and add greatly to efficiency in carrying on extending and controlling operations. 1
( 2 ) The vaccination establishment. 6. The vaccination establishment is under the administration of the Sanitary Commissioner acting as Superintendent-General, and consists of 3 Deputy Sanitary Commissioners or Superintendents of Circles, of 48 Civil Surgeons and Civil Medical Officers as District Superintendents, of 49 district Assistant Super- intendents of different grades, and 848 Vaccinators of all classes. There are besides 44 paid Apprentice Vaccinators. Distribution of the establishment. 7. The distribution of the establishment during 1893-94, was as follows :( 3 ) Increase and decrease of expenditure from several funds. 10. There was a decrease in expenditure from provincial funds of Rs. 377-9-1; and an increase of expenditure from local funds of Rs. 2,067-2-8, from municipal funds of Rs. 2,512-15-8, and from other sources of Rs. 309-5-0. Average cost of each successful case of vaccination. 11. The average cost of each successful case of vaccination was two annas and one pie, as compared with two annas and seven pies in the previous year, and two annas and eight pies during the previous quinquennium. Comparison of the cost of vaccination in the different provinces. 12. The total expenditure on vaccination in the different provinces and Chief Commissionerships in 1892-93, is compared in the following table :( 4 ) Statement showing the number of successful primary vaccinations and deaths from smallpox Serial Number.

( 6 ) Operations in the 1st circle. 16. A total of 340,177 persons were vaccinated and 5,419 re-vaccinated against 296,963 and 8,492, respectively, in 1892-93. The number of primary successful operations rose from 255,726 to 308,171, and the average number of per- sons vaccinated by each vaccinator from 1,554 to 1,726. There was likewise an increase in the percentage of success, 95.97 per cent. being recorded against 93.58; and 30.00 per 1,000 of the population were successfully, vaccinated, as compared with 24.99 in the previous season. The operations in the 1st Circle have always been in advance of those of the other Circles; and much of the excellence of the work is undoubtedly due to the painstaking care and zeal, which Dr. Jameson has shown in directly supervising operations and controlling the Vaccination Staff. The Civil Surgeon of the Saháranpur district, Dr. Tuohy, acknowledges that the results of the operations in his district have been successful beyond his conception, and that the method and supervision of vaccination under previous arrangements secured results which, in his opinion, were in every way excellent. The following table shows the increase, or decrease, in the number of successful primary vaccinations. in the various districts of the 1st Circle. Division. District.

Increase and decrease in successful vac- cination in the various districts. 17. There was a slight decrease in the number of successful primary operations in the Dehra Dún dìstrict, and in Tehri Garhwál. In every other district there was a notable increase in successful vaccinations, and the increase was most marked in the Etah district, where operations were pushed forward and greatly extended through the exertions of Mr. Galbraith the Magistrate and Collector. In Aligarh also there was a large increase of 8,341 in the number of successful primary operations, due to the zeal of Dr. Roberts and Mr. Harrison, the Collector, assisted by an energetic Assistant Superintendent. Summary of District Superintendents' reports. 18. The operations in the various districts of the 1st Circle are summarized as follows :( 7 ) In Mussoorie 499 primary operations and 71 re-vaccinations were recorded, of which 210 primary cases and 38 re-vaccinations were performed within the Municipal Circle. There was an increase of 94 in the primary operations as compared with the previous year. Registers I and II were maintained. Certificates of vaccination were not issued in many cases. 7 notices under section 17, and 2 notices under section 18 of the Act were issued. In the Landour Cantonment 71 primary operations and 29 re-vaccinations were performed. 221 primary vaccinations were performed in Dehra Cantonment, against 112 births, in 1893. A total of 4,963 primary operations were recorded in the district, and there was a decrease of 133 as compared with the previous year, owing to a decrease of one Vacci- nator in the working staff. The District Superintendent of Vaccination inspected 18.73 per cent. of the whole number, and was 29 days on tour marching all over the district, with the exception of the hill tract of Jaunsar Bawar, which was inspected by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner. 96.93 per cent. of the cases inspected were found successful. Humanised lymph was invariably used. The conduct of subordinates was satisfactory. The district staff, except in one instance, used their influence in favor of vaccination, and an examination of children above the usual age for operation showed that they had all been vaccinated. Summary of Sahâranpur report. 20. In the Saháranpur municipality, 2,592 operations were performed against 2,284 in the previous year. Certificates were properly issued, but Registers I and II were not properly kept. Five persons were summoned under the Act, and 22 notices were issued, but the pro- visions of the Act were not enforced. In the Hardwar Union, the total number of vaccinations was 1,022 against 903 in 1892-93, but there was a falling off in the percentage of successful cases from 95.66 to 89.26, owing to the neglect of the Vaccinator who was dismissed before the close of the season. The Registers were not kept up, and action taken under sections 17, 18 and 22 was without effect. Certificates were not regularly issued. In the Roorkee municipality a total of 456 operations was performed, and there were 128 vaccinations in Cantonment and 48 in the villages close to Roorkee. The people do not seem averse to vaccination, but notices had to be issued to a great extent as it had been the custom in former years for the Vaccinator to operate from house to house. The Register of all children liable to be vaccinated was properly maintained. Certi- ficates were regularly granted. The total number of vaccinations in the Saháranpur district was 33,954 against 30,537, and the percentage of primary successful cases was 97.25 as compared with 95.51 in the previous year. The District Superintendent was on tour for 37 days and in- spected 18.49 per cent. of the total number vaccinated. He was much impressed with the success of the work in the villages throughout the district, and did not discover a single false entry; of the 20 Vaccinators, 5 performed over 2,000 operations each. Assistance was given by District Officers. Summary of Muzaffarnagar report. 21. In the Muzaffarnagar municipality there were 845 primary operations against 554 ; in Kairana municipality 527 against 441, and in the Kandhla municipality 346 against 321, in the previous year. Registers I and II were not properly kept up. Certificates of vac- cination were issued in all cases in Muzaffarnagar municipality. No notices were issued under the Act.
( 8 ) In the district, the total number of operations was 23,751 against 22,005 in 1892-93. The Superintendent was on tour for 53 days and examined 2,231 cases, of which 34 only were found unsuccessful and 20 doubtful. The conduct of the vacci- nation staff was satisfactory, and the Assistant Superintendent worked hard. The Jats and Gujars of the district are strongly opposed to vaccination. Material assist- ance should be afforded to Vaccinators by the District Officials. Summary of Meerut report. 22. In the Meerut municipality 2,292 primary vaccinations were performed, and there were 729 children vaccinated outside municipal bounds, including 499 prisoners in the District Jail, making a total of 3,021 operations by the two municipal vaccinators. The work was inspected on 5 occasions, and the quality on the whole was good. There is nominally a vaccination station at the city branch dispensary but the work has been carried on from house to house as heretofore, and in time no doubt the law to compel parents to bring children to appointed places, may be carried out effectively. Registers I and II were kept up, but difficulty was experienced in completing Register II. Certificates of vaccination were granted in all cases; 104 notices were issued under section 17 of the Act, of which 99 were complied with, 5 parents being reported for non-com- pliance, and of these 4 submitted their children to operation, and one case remained undecided. In the Sardhana municipality 431 children were vaccinated, and 693 in adjacent villages. Registers I and II were both kept up. Certificates were granted in all cases. Three notices were issued and complied with. House to house vaccination was continued, there being no vaccination station fixed. In the Ghaziabad municipality 457 primary operations were performed, and 805 in adjacent villlages. Both Registers were maintained and certificates of vaccination were issued in all cases. 7 notices were issued under section 17, and 6 were complied with, the remaining one being ineffective as the child had left the town. There was no fixed vaccination station, and the operation was carried on from house to house. In the Baraut municipality 283 primary vaccinations were performed, and 1,068 in adjacent villages. Both Registers I and II were kept up. Certificates were granted in all cases. One notice only was issued, but not complied with before the end of the season. House to house vaccination was carried on as formerly, there being no vacillation station. In the Baghpat municipality 227 operations were carried out in addition to 685 in adjacent villages. The Registers were maintained. Certificates were regularly granted. 27 notices were served and complied with, one case only being reported to the Magistrate. There was no vaccination station, and the operations were performed from house to house. In the Meerut Cantonment 1,787 primary operations were performed, and 121 in a few villages adjacent to Cantonment, and 102 re-vaccinations also in Cantonment. Both Registers were kept up, and certificates granted in all cases, 44 notices were issued under section 17 of the Act, 26 being at once complied with, the remaining 18 after report made to the Cantonment Magistrate, were likewise effective without further trouble. The Vaccination Act is not in force in the municipalities of Hapur, Mawana, Pilkhua and Shahdara. In the district generally, the net result of the seasons operations was an increase of 2,557 primary operations. The percentage of success was 94.56 as compared with 91.20 of the previous year. In all 40,286 primary operations were performed. There was a total of 382 re-vaccinations, and the necessity of extending such operations is obvious. The Superintendent spent 32 days in tour, and in addition to 11 inspections
( 9 ) at headquarters he saw 3,453 cases in the district. 96.32per cent. of the cases examined were found successful, and the work was of good quality. Human lymph was invari- ably used. The conduct of Assistant Superintendent and Vaccinators was on the whole good. District officials were always ready to give assistance. The people are well disposed to vaccination especially the Jats, and this statement is in marked contrast with that of the Superintendent of the Muzaffarnagar district. Dr Moriarty says : &quot; In the jat villages I found the lambardar very friendly and ready to give every assist- ance. The Rangars on the other hand are not so accessible, and in some villages have considerably hindered work.&quot; Summary of Bulaudshahr report. 23. In the Bulandshahr municipality there were .613 primary vaccinations against 522 in the previous season. Registers I and II were not maintained. Certificates of vaccination were granted. 11 notices were issued under the Act, of which 9 were at once complied with. In one case the parent was fined and the child vaccinated, and in the other case the parents refused to have the girl, a parda-nashin, vaccinated. House to house vaccination was practised although a vaccination station was provided. In the district 33,326 primary operations were performed as compared with 27,202 in 1892-93, and the percentage of success rose from 97.36 to 98.31. The Superin- tendent was on tour for 40 days and examined 4,107 cases, of which 3,851 were suc- cessful on both arms, 190 successful on one arm, and 66 unsuccessful. Some opposition to vaccination was experienced in certain villages, but the prejudice against the operation was readily overcome by the Magistrate, Mr. Porter, who with the district officials rendered great assistance. Summary of Aligarh report. 24. In the Aligarh municipality 2,378 primary operations were performed as com- pared with 2,221 in the previous year. No parent or guardian was summoned under the Act. Registers I and II were not properly maintained. Certificates of vaccination were granted. In the Hathras municipality, the Vaccination Act is not yet in force.

No notices were issued under the Act, but parents were warned with good effect. The Registers were not scrupulously kept up. In the district, there was a total of 40,015 primary operations as compared with 31,749 in season 1892-93; 37,985 vaccinations were recorded as successful. There was a decrease of 497 in re-vaccinations. The District Superintendent was 20 days on tour and inspected 2,800 cases in a very searching and thorough manner, and the results are shown as follows :( 10 ) Dr. Robert's experience in Oudh three years ago. The attitude of the people was decidedly favorable to vaccination. The district officials gave much personal help in extending operations. Summary of Muttra report. 25.

The supply and quality of the lymph was invariably good, and the conduct of the staff satisfactory. Inoculation of small pox in 1st circle unknown. 31.

The Assistant Superintendent performed his duty very satisfactorily. Summary of Unao report. 43. In the Unao municipality 299 vaccinations were performed, and any falling off in number was due to the fact that about 500 men left the town with their families early in the season for settlement work. Registers I and II were not properly maintained. Notices were issued and certificates granted. In the district the number of operations rose from 12,831 to 35,422 and the number of successful cases from 10,285 to 28,214, and this result is largely due to the active interest taken in vaccination by Mr. Penney, the Deputy Commissioner. The District Superintendent inspected 1,846 cases. The Assistant Superintendent is com- mended for zeal. The attitude of the people in some parts of the district was hostile at the beginning of the season, but any opposition was eventually broken by the advice given by the district officials. 5,018 points of bovine lymph were sent out from the depôt established in the Sadr station. Summary of Barabanki report. 44. In the Nawabganj municipality 437 operations were performed against 308 in 1892-1893. Registers I and II were duly main- tained. Certificates were granted.

In the Sitapur municipality, 1,271 persons were vaccinated, and 201 re-vacci- nations were performed with bovine lymph. Registers I and II were maintained, but it is doubtful if the lists were complete. No pronounced hostility to vaccination was shown in Sitapur. Certi- ficates were not granted. 150 notices were issued. No legal proceedings were taken to enforce vaccination, and such proceedings were considered unnecessary. In the Khairabad municipality, 999 primary vaccinations were performed and 2 re-vaccinations, and both bovine lymph from Sitapur and human lymph were used. Register I in the form of a list was supplied by the municipal authorities, and no pro- nounced hostility to vaccination was shown. Certificates were not regularly granted 159 notices were issued, of which about one-half only were complied with. In the Sitapur Cantonment, 160 operations were performed within cantonment limits. In the district, the operations were carried on with great zeal and vigour, with the result that the number of operations reached the large total of 73,853 as compared with 31,130 during the previous season. The percentage of success was 85.44, and the low average is accounted for by Dr. Barry by the people the moment the vaccinators turn their backs doing &quot; everything in their power by washing, &c., to neutralize the effect of the inoculated lymph.&quot; The District Superintendent was 35 days on tour, and including extra days the inspections were carried over 40 days, and he examined 5,695 cases, and of these he &quot; found only about 13 false entries as regards success or
( 16 ) non-success.&quot; The Hospital Assistants of the branch dispensaries were also constituted Inspectors, and a total of 3,740 cases were thus inspected. Col. Grigg took up vacci- nation warmly and practically enlisted the whole district staff; as inspecting officers, and Dr. Barry believes the result of operations in the district to be beyond suspicion. A considerable amount of opposition had to be overcome, but by vaccinating the child of the headman of the village, &c., opposition generally disappeared. The conduct of the vaccinators was not altogether satisfactory. Coming under close supervision they required sharp punishment to bring them to recognise that their duty and interest lay in doing as much work as possible. Dr. Barry is of opinion &quot;that the amount of protection is not to be gauged by the number of vaccination scars, and such a theory that the more scars the better protection, is hardly borne out from the knowledge of other specific fevers. This is a point of considerable value in pushing vaccination among a people often bitterly opposed to it.&quot; Summary of Hardoi report. 46.

The notices in a large city cannot be served personally by the District Superintendent, who recommends the introduction of a regis- ter of notices showing results. In the district, the total number of operations was 25,304, which shows a small increase only on the results of the previous season. The District Superintendent was 28 days in camp and spent 8 separate days inspecting 3,858 cases, of which 175 were unsuccessful and 40 doubtful. The Assistant Superintendent performed his duty satis- factorily, but be work of some of the vaccinators was far from efficient.

In the district 25,206 persons were vaccinated, against 24,588 in 1892-93. The attitude of the people to vaccination is not altogether satisfactory, but the meagre results may be due in part to want of energy of the Vaccination Staff. The assistance of members of the District Board is required particularly in Ahraula, Atraulia and Nizamabad, where no help or countenance is given to the vaccinators. The Superin- tendent was on tour for 57 days, and inspected 2,428 cases. Summary of Mirzapur report. 66.

The people do not, as a rule, object to have their children vaccinated. Some of the district officials took considerable interest in the work. One vaccinator only is commended for good work. Summary of Benares report. 67. In the Benares municipality, the total number of primary vaccinations per- formed was 6,698, against 2,596 in 1891-92, and 3,160 in 1892-93. The percentage of success ob- served on inspection by Dr. Venis, the Superintendent, was 94.5. Certificates of vac- cination were regularly given. Register I was maintained, and a large number of notices was issued under the Act and summonses issued in some cases, and of the latter all but three parents, who were subsequently fined complied with the Magistrate's orders. Difficulty was experienced at first in serving notices. It is stated that not more than 2,000 persons in Benares will willingly have their children vaccinated. The Superin- tendent recommends the use of calf lymph in Benares, and an amendment of the law which requires the Superintendent himself to serve notices under section 17 of the Act. It is physically impossible to personally serve notices in such a large city. In the district, a total of 21,645 vaccinations was performed against 20,111 in the previous year. The conduct of the Vaccination Staff was good, and the work of the Assistant Superintendent very good. The district staff afforded aid. Many of the people are very prejudiced and some villages have hitherto been omitted from the field of operations, which shall be extended to them next season. The names of 6 men, 5 of the mali caste and 1 Kayasth, are noted who practise inoculation in various parts of the district. Summary of Gházipur report. 68. In the Gházipur municipality, 1,016 operations were performed against 1,880 in 1892-93. Register I only was kept up, but the requirements of the Act will be fully com- plied with next season. 6
( 22 ) In the district, 23,976 vaccinations were recorded against 23,325 in 1892-93. The District Superintendent was on tour for 20 days, and inspected 2,155 cases. The attitude of the people towards vaccination is not friendly, and existing prejudice renders the work difficult in some areas. Inoculation is practised to some extent by men coming from Bengal in the hot season when small-pox is most prevalent. The Assist- ant Superintendent is commended for zeal and good work. Summary of Ballia report. 69. In the Ballia municipality, 846 persons were vaccinated against 569 in the previous year. The registers were properly maintained and certificates regularly granted. Three hundred and fifty-three notices were issued, and 313 were complied with ; 40 cases being referred to the Magistrate, who took the necessary steps to get the children vaccinated. In the district, 18,992 operations were performed against 18,297 in 1892-93. The district vaccination staff is insufficient in number for the work. The attitude of people is hostile in many villages, but Mr. Campbell, the Magistrate, was successful in breaking new ground this season and in overcoming prejudice. The District Superintendent was on tour for 24 days and inspected 3,300 cases. The Assistant Superintendent worked well. Summary of Jhansi report. 70. In the Jhansi municipality, there was a falling off of 461 primary vaccinations, and the number of primary operations was 1,802 against 2,263 in 1892-93. Registers were properly kept up. Certificates were issued including 91 certificates of unfitness. No prosecu- tion was instituted. In Jhansi Cantonment, 374 primary operations and 35 re-vaccinations were per- formed against 313 and 4, respectively, in the previous season. The registers were properly kept, and certificates were granted including one certificate of unfitness. No prosecution was required. In the Lalitpur municipality, 428 operations were performed against 305 in 1892-93. The Vaccination Act was not in force during the season. In the Mau-Ranipur municipality, 1,082 primary vaccinations were performed. Registers were kept in order and certificates issued according to the rules. Not a single prosecution was necessary, and the few notices were, after explanation of the benefits of vaccination, complied with. In the district, 21,505 persons were vaccinated as compared with 20,641 in the previous year. The lymph received from headquarters was sufficient and of good quality. The vaccination staff worked fairly well. There is no marked opposition to vaccination among the people, except among the higher castes. The Collector and Joint- Magistrate both interested themselves much in extending work. The Superintendent was on tour for 26 days, and inspected 2,735 cases, of which 93.27 were successful. Summary of Jalaun report. 71. In the Orai municipality, there were 489 vaccinations, an increase of 24 on the previous year. Registers I and II were duly kept up and certificates of vaccination were issued in all cases. Sixty-five notices were served, and 7 parents were summoned under section 18 of the Act. No punishment was awarded. In the Kalpi municipality, 620 vaccinations were performed as compared with 279 in the previous season. Sixty-two notices were issued under the Act and all complied with. Certificates were regularly granted, and the registers of children liable to be vacci- nated were kept up. In the Kunch municipality, the operations increased from 399 in 1891-92 and 538 in 1892-93 to 572. The registers were properly maintained. Certificates were regularly granted. Ten notices were issued and all were complied with. In the district, a total of 11,924 primary operations were performed, of which 11,319 were successful. The Superintendent was on tour for 38 days, and inspected
( 23 ) 1,447 cases. The lymph was adequate and good. The attitude of the people to vaccination was favourable generally. The district staff gave every assistance, and the conduct of the Vaccinators was good. General results of the operations in the 3 Circles compared. 72. In the 1st Circle the total number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of the population was 30.00, as compared with 27.69 in the 2nd Circle and 20.33 in the 3rd Circle, and the percentage of successful primary operations in which the results were known in the 1st Circle, was 95.97 against 90.97 in the 2nd Circle and 94.12 in the 3rd Circle. Vaccination according to age. 73. 521,879 infants under one year of age were successfully vaccinated against 424,016 in the previous season and 378,512 in 1891-92, and the increase in the season amounts to the large total of 97,863. This increase is very satisfactory when it is considered that infants are not usually vaccinated, and compulsory vaccination of infants in India is not permitted, under the age of six months. Vaccination in proportion to births. 74. The following table shows the total births, and the number of successful pri- mary vaccinations, at the different age periods, and the percentage of successful primary vaccinations to total births :( 24 ) List of applicants supplied with lymph, during season, 1893-94. 77. The list of applicants who were supplied with lymph, during the season 1893- 94, is given in the report of the 2nd Circle, which forms Appendix B of this report. Inspection of operations. 78. The results of inspection of the operations of the year, are shown in the fol- lowing table. The last column indicates the propor- tion per cent. of successful cases actually verified by inspection to total number of operations entered as successful. In the 1st and 2nd Circles the proportion per cent. increased from 41.92 and 23.15 to 48.96 and 32.77, res- pectively, while in the 3rd Circle there was a slight falling off from 36.06 in 1892-93 to 35.65. The inspections of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner of the 3rd Circle were limited, owing to his prolonged absence on special duty in connection with the Magh Kumbh Fair, at Allahabad :( 25 ) In the 3rd Circle, the results were much the same as in previous years and there is room for improvement in the Bánda, Allahabad and in Gházipur and Ballia districts, where strict supervision of the operations is required at the hands of District Superin- tendents. Animal lymph. 81. Hitherto none of the Civil Surgeons in the 1st Circle have interested them- selves in cultivating animal lymph; and during the past season, with the exception of an inconsiderable number of operations performed with animal lymph in the districts of Agra and Main- puri, vaccination in the 1st Circle was carried on on the arm-to-arm system with huma- nised lymph throughout the season. In the 2nd Circle, the important animal lymph depôt at Lucknow was kept up during the cold weather, and the percentage of successful operations performed with animal lymph from this depôt reached 89.46. The following table shows the stations at which animal lymph depôts were established, and where the operations with ani- mal lymph exceeded 1,000, and indicates the result in each case :gram illustrating the death-rate from small-pox in the city of Lucknow, as compared with the death- rate from small-pox in London.

( 27 ) Localities in which the Vaccination Act is in force. 83. With the exception of the municipalities of Shahdara, Hapur, Pilkhua, Mawana (Meerut) ; and Bhinga (Bahraich), the Vaccina- tion Act (XIII of 1880) is in force in all of the 103 municipalities of the United Provinces; and it is also in force in all Military Canton- ments. The extension of the Act to municipalities has not been much opposed and while, as will be seen from the summaries of municipal reports, the application of the Act has not been strict in many instances, there is no reason to doubt that within another season all the provisions of the Act will be more or less properly carried into effect. The total births recorded in the 103 municipal towns during 1893 was 127,695 and there were in all 125,716 in successful primary vaccinations. Over 100,000 successful vaccinations are required annually to protect the infant population in municipalities, and this number should at no distant date be covered by the operations in municipalities generally. Reports of Deputy Sanitary Cominis- sioners. 84. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioners in their reports (which form Appen- dices A. to C.) refer chiefly to the general success of the year's operations. Dr. Jameson says the high birth-rate of the year, and the lengthened period during which vaccination was continued and the aid given by the district staff account for the increase in operations, all districts, with the exception of Dehra Dún and Tehri Garhwál, contributing to the increase in results. Dr. Jameson refers to the fact that in all districts there are still some villages in which vaccination is unpopular. In the 1st Circle, animal lymph was little used, and a fully equipped calf lymph depôt, he says, is needed. Vaccination in the hot weather was not a success owing to the degeneration of the lymph, and the opposition of vaccinators to continue work beyond the usual period. Dr. Thorald advocates an increase in the number of vaccinators in the districts of Bahraich, Sultánpur and Gonda. The endeavour to keep up a supply of lymph in the districts during the hot weather was not successful, on account of the unpopularity of the operation at this time when there is an increased tendency to fever and a greater tendency to ulceration, but no exact data are given in support of the statement. Experi- ments with lanoline vaccine paste were carried out in a somewhat indifferent manner, and the results were necessarily imperfect. The employment of extra vaccinators is again referred to with reference to the entertainment of a certain number in the Bara Banki district, where, however, steps had already been taken to limit the work, and the extension of vaccination, to the regular staff. Dr. Giles refers to the difficulty in maintaining the lymph supply during the hot weather owing to the impossibility of keeping the vesicle intact till maturity. He reports that the quality of the work &quot; was as a rule excellent and that the majority of the vac- cinators were neat and systematic in their method.&quot; He is of opinion, that there is still a vast amount of prejudice and misapprehension among the people on the subject of vaccination. Vaccination in spite of this, he says, is making progress steadily. Some districts which are backward, namely, Mirzapur, Azamgarh and Basti are short handed as regards the Vaccination staff. Progress in vaccination. 85. The vigour with which operations have been carried on for the past few years in the United Provinces has been very marked, and the results of the year's operations, in view of the opposition and prejudice which still exist, are very satisfactory. The advance made has been more than considerable; and if the good work done in many districts were achieved in all, protection against small-pox in the United Provinces would soon extend to nearly every child as it does in some areas in the 1st Circle. Vaccination in the United Provinces to be
( 28 ) complete, implies the successful vaccination of at least 1,330,000 children annually, and against that number 1,181,600 successful vaccinations were recorded as stated during the past season. A little more effort and exactness in system and method by District Super- intendents, aided as hitherto by district authorities, and the work will soon be fully accomplished.

APPENDICES
( 2A ) APPENDIX A. Annual Report on Vaccination in the 1st Circle by Brigade Surgeon Lieutenant' Colonel R. JAMESON, M. D., Deputy Sanitary Commissioner. The season began on the same date as last year, viz., the first October, all vacci- nators having been directed to be at their posts on 20th September, but it was continued in all districts, except Muttra, till 15th April. Circular No. 234 of 26th February 1894, directing vaccination to be continued till 15th April was overlooked in Muttra and work in that district ceased as in former years on 22nd March. The result of the season's work is satisfactory on the whole, primary successful vaccinations having increased by 52,445, from 255,726 to 308,171. On the other hand re-vaccinations show a decrease of 3,073 operations. All districts except Dehra Dun and Tehri Garhwal contributed to the increase in primary vaccinations. In the former there is a decrease of 68 and in the latter of 232. The districts which show most increase are Bulandshahr 6,483, Aligarh 8,341, Agra 4,849, and Etah 9,830. The high birth-rate of the year and the lengthened period during which vaccination was continued, account for much of this increase. The great increase in Etah is particularly satisfactory, for hitherto this district has been one of the most backward in the circle. An increase of two vaccinators was made to the district staff from 1st October, but it is to the Collector of the district, Mr. Galbraith, that this excellent result is principally due. Mr. Galbraith directed all patwaris to make out a list of all children unvaccinated in the village or villages in their jurisdiction. They were also to try and persuade the best families in these villages to lead the way by having their children vaccinated. This list and this assistance have had the excellent result mentioned. The decline in re-vaccinations is almost as general as the increase in primary vacci- nations. Muzaffarnagar, Meerut and Etah show an increase compared with last year of 141, 69 and 251, all the other districts show a decrease of from 72 in Etawah to 1,050 in Tehri Garhwál. In Tehri Garhwál it was observed that among the re-vaccinations were many old people, 40 years of age and upwards. These were mostly unsuccess- ful and such work only swelled the records without advantage. Hence, the decline in Tehri. In the plains re-vaccination is not yet popular and children of 8 years and upwards disappear very quickly at sight of a vaccinator. Moreover, the lymph used in re-vaccinating does not renew itself, no points being filled from such cases. It is only, therefore, when lymph is abundant that it can be spared for re-vaccinations. Making all Civil Surgeons, District Superintendents of Vaccination within their districts has had in most cases the excellent result of also enlisting the district staff in aid of vaccination. The whole district staff are now more or less interested in the pro- gress made. To counterbalance this good, municipal and local vaccinators have been in many cases prohibited by municipal and local authorities from working beyond the limits of those municipalities and towns from which they are paid. Vaccination stations also limit the usefulness of vaccinators. The vaccinator must be present in the appointed place at certain hours, usually all the morning and forenoon, whether children are brought to be vaccinated or not. Formerly all villages with a radius of from 3 to 5 miles of a municipality or the Headquarters of a local vaccinator were within his jurisdiction. A smaller staff of Government vaccinators then sufficed for the rest of the district than now. Where municipal and local vaccinators are nu- merous, as in Meerut, the Government vaccinators are unable to take up these vacant localities in addition to their own circles. Prohibiting municipal and local vaccinators in small towns from vaccinating beyond the limits of such towns, is advantageous to no- body but the vaccinator. If this prohibition be continued it will be necessary to increase the number of Government vaccinators in such districts, or have parts of them vac- cinated once in two years only.
( 3A ) In Aligarh two extra vaccinators accompanied the Collector and the Joint-Magis- trate, wherever they went in the district. Wherever district officers encamped, the vaccinators performed a few operations, getting lymph for the purpose from some other vaccinator. This arrangement is bad. These men could seldom test the work they did, and other vaccinators would not willingly test it, for the latter could not count this work as their own. If the district can pay for extra vaccinators it would be much better to employ them in the abandoned villages around municipalities and towns from which municipal and local vaccinators have been excluded. In all districts there are still some villages, though decreasing year by year, in which vaccination is unpopular. I have visited as many of these as possible, and in- variably with good result. There is one inducement which never fails in these villages if combined with patience. It is the all-powerful pice, a pice to each child brought to be vaccinated. This wonderful talisman soon converts sour looks into smiles and laughter. Doors hitherto shut are flung open, and it is oftener the lymph that fails than the candidates for pice and vaccination. In 1892-93 the quality of the work done was generally very good, above the aver- age. That of 1893-94) was less satisfactory. Much was excellent, but much was in- different. Vaccinators vary exceedingly in the quality of the work they do. Some use only good lymph. Others seem to care little whether the vesicle from which lymph is to be taken is of good or indifferent quality, whether immature or too old. In work of this kind a good crust is seldom seen. The vesicles break before the 7th day, and fresh lymph has continually to be sent from elsewhere to these men. A calf lymph depôt for the circle is much needed. To improve the lymph in Mainpuri, the Civil Surgeon on three occasions vaccinated a buffalo calf. Of 16 chil- dren vaccinated from this lymph, 15 proved successful. Some of the lymph was mixed with lanoline and with this lanoline lymph 19 children were vaccinated. Of these only 6 proved successful. In Agra 871 vaccinations were made with bovine lymph, of which 691 were successful. The percentage of successful cases was 86.26. In no other district was animal lymph used. Of 12,140 primary vaccinations seen by me, 485 were non-successful and 741 had only one vesicle or mark. Only 15 had more than two marks. The departmental orders to vaccinate in 4 places has therefore been little heeded. In three districts in the plains vaccination was continued throughout the hot weather, viz., Agra, Muttra and Etah. In Etah the lymph degenerated but was renewed. In the other 8 districts (excluding Dehra Dun), lymph degenerated, or ulcerations resulted, or the people objected, and the work was stopped. Vaccination in the hot weather is, of course, very unpopular with the vaccinators themselves. This is not to be wondered at seeing, that when the seniors entered the department, the vaccination season was only of 5 months' duration. Now it is nearly seven( 4A ) I know of no instance in which parents were punished for not having their children vaccinated, even though summoned, and the Civil Surgeon of Saháranpur pronounces the Vaccination Act to be a dead letter in that city. In conclusion I have to add that most of the vaccinators worked well. Non-success- ful cases are occasionally found entered as successful, the vaccinators not having person- ally inspected these, and too frequently indifferent lymph is used. Ulcerated arms are not uncommon, but for these it is the filth applied to the vesicle by the mothers to keep off flies that is principally to blame. Two or three cases of erysipelas following vaccination, are usually seen annually, and sometimes an abscess in the armpit. Considering the grossly insanitary state in which the children are brought up, it is surprising there is so little erysipelas. Had the quality of the work been equal to that of 1892-93, I would have been much pleased with the season, 1893-94. As it is one may express satisfaction with the result. R. JAMESON, M. D., Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, 1st Circle.
( 5A ) APPENDIX B. Annual Report on Vaccination in the 2nd Circle, by Surgeon-Captain W. G. Thorold, Deputy Sanitary Commissioner. I have the honour to submit herewith the annual report for the year 1893-94 for the II Circle, North-Western Provinces and Oudh. The delay in submission, which I regret, has been caused by the re-organisation of the department, and the consequent compilation in many offices of the returns which previously have been compiled in this office alone. 2. The year under review has been one of a new departure in these Provinces, as regards the administration of the department : the direct control of the Vaccination staff having been transferred to the Civil Surgeons of districts; the Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioner having special charge of 5 or 6 districts, where the duties of the Civil Surgeons prevent the latter going on tour., and in other districts, the Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioner is purely an inspecting and checking officer. It is as yet too early to en- deavour to criticise with any soundness, the effects of the change of system. In this year, also, the period for performing vaccinations has been extended from March 31st to April 15th; although in certain cases municipalities, who make rules for themselves, have ordered that the old date for the discontinuance of operations was to be adhered to. 3. Briefly reviewing the work of the year, it is satisfactory to be able to note a most marked increase in the amount of work done. (a) The average number of vaccinators employed during the season 1893-94, was 364, which shows an increase of 7 over the strength of the preceding season. (b) The total number of vaccinations, both primary and secondary, was 616,511, which shows an increase of 166,396 over the number of the preceding season. Every district in this circle, except Naini Tal, Sultánpur and Partábgarh, contribute to this increase; the two districts of Sitapur and Rae Bareli showing an increase of 42,098, and 18,852, respectively. The falling off in the number of vaccinations preformed in Naini Tal and Partáb- garh has been slight, but in Sultânpur the decrease amounts to 8,553. I attribute this decrease partially at any rate, to the appointment of a new Assistant Superintendent in the middle of the working season, the previous Assistant Superintendent being also a newly appointed man. (c) The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator, including both primary and secondary operations, was 1693.71, which shows an increase of 432.88 over the average of the preceding season. (d) The successful primary vaccinations tabulated according to age, may be thus contrasted.( 6A ) vaccinators are employed by the estate ; the work of these men is subject to no properly organised scrutiny, nor is it entered in the district returns ; yet the work done by Govern- ment and Municipal vaccinators is calculated on the whole population of the district, inclu- ding, of course, the population of the Kapurthala estate. I would strongly recom- mend that the pay of these vaccinators be handed over to the District Board, as is recommended by the District Superintendent of Vaccination in Bahraich ; and that properly enrolled vccinators be appointed in the Kapurthala estate; and method introduced. Money is thus handed over by the Maharájás of Benares, and Viziana- gram in the Benares district and by the Maharájáh of Benares in Mirzapur district; (3) The number of vaccinators (12) is disproportionate to the population (1,000,432). The district has ample jungle towards the north, and is therefore difficult to travel in and it is impossible for each vaccinator to protect a fair proportion per 1,000, when, on an average, he has 83,369 persons to look after. There should be at least 16 Vaccinators, and I request that steps may be taken to increase the vaccination staff. (4) The interest shown in vaccination by the district officials is at best lukewarm, and differs widely from the interest shown in many neighbouring districts. Only strenuous efforts on the part of the district authorities will break down the opposition of the people to vaccination. In Gonda the reasons are much the same as regards reasons (1) and (4) given above; and as regards reason (3) the number of vaccinators is 20, and the population 1,459,229 giving an average of 72,961 of population to be protected by each vaccinator. This average is too large and there should be at least 24 vaccinators, and I would request that steps be taken to increase the vaccination staff. In Sultánpur exactly the same reasons apply, and the disproportion between the number of vaccinators and the population is enormously increased. There were in 1893- 94 four Government Vaccinators, 1 Municipal Vaccinator and 5 extra. Vaccinators, and the population is 1,075,851 giving an average over 100,000 to be protected by each vaccinator. There should be at least 18 permanent Vaccinators provided for in the District Budget, exclusive of the Municipal Vaccinator, and I would request that steps be taken to this end. In reading these remarks it should, however, be remembered that the ratio of per- sons protected per 1,000 in this circle has increased nearly 100 per cent. during 1893- 94 as contrasted with the ratio protected per 1,000 during the preceding 5 years. The total expenditure for the year 1893-94 was 57,782-12-6 which shows an increase of 1,170-6-1, and the average cost. of each vaccination was 0-1-9 which shows a de- crease of 8 pie per vaccination. 4. As regards the endeavour to keep lymph current through the hot weather in each district, I am of opinion that vaccination during hot months in the plains is most unpopular, owing to the increased tendency to fever and irritation of vesicle, especially during the rains, when ulcers are liable to form and sometimes difficult to heal. Dur- ing my tour in June 1893, I had many complaints made to me personally, and I also received many letters on the subject. Many districts in Oudh are still actively hostile to vaccination, and for the present, 1 think that it would be advisable to has- ten slowly. 5. I append a statement showing the results obtained from vaccination with lano- line and vaccine paste of various ages. All this paste was prepared at Lauknow Bovine Depôt; it was a mixture of vaccine, 1 part to lanoline 3 parts; it was forwarded to me every other day, and issued to various Civil Surgeons for experiment. Considering that the staff had not been trained by long practice in manufacture, and that the absence of a grant necessitates that expenditure on the many vessels, carrying bags, trans- port boxes, &c., should be curtailed as much as possible, the results are not discoura- ging. Until, however, the Government sets aside a fairly large sum for establishment of a properly arranged institution on the hills, the issue of lanoline paste can only be carried on in an experimental manner. The Lucknow Bovine Depô is useful to start
( 7A ) vaccination amongst persons who prefer vaccination from the calf, but such persons amongst natives are extremely few. The Civil Surgeon of Sitapur, an extremely con- conscientious medical officer, reports that from his personal observation of the vesicles resulting from vaccination with pure calf lymph, he came to the conclusion that his order that &quot; only the Municipalities of Sitapur and Khairabad were to be supplied &quot; was a wise one; Sitapur is where the lymph depôt is placed and Khairabad is con- nected with Sitapur by rail. The Civil Surgeon of Unao recommends that the calf lymph depôt be closed, as it is unnecessary; and that the money thus saved be ex- pended in the provision of an additional permanent vaccinatior, who is needed. The Civil Surgeon of Hardoi recommends that the calf lymph depôt be abolished, as the result of vaccination with pure calf lymph are not so good as the results of arm-to- arm vaccination, and moreover animal lymph is not needed. Amongst those best quali- fied to speak( 8A ) of villages and cases is calculated on the period of time at my disposal for inspection, it will be seen that the number of inspections have relatively increased. Results of Inspection. Number of villages visited. Number of cases of vaccination tested. Percentage of success in known cases. Proportion per cent., ins- pections to total number vaccinated. 479 7,655 91.60 1.24 The supply of lymph from Kumaun, by which the whole of the work in this circle was started, was uniformly pronounced by Civil Surgeons to be excellent and it was punctually supplied. The percentage of success in known cases is practically the same as that observed by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner in this circle during the preceding year. The conclusion, so often previously arrived at as to the unreliability of temporary vaccina- tors, is pointed out again by the Civil Surgeon of Bara Banki, who states his definite opinion that it is much better to employ a few permanent vaccinators than a great number of temporary vaccinators. As regards the future trust the villagers will put in the efficacy of vaccination, I cordially agree with the Civil Surgeon of Bara Banki; for the work of the temporary vaccinators is very often bad and non-protective against small-pox, and when the deluded parent sees his pseudo-vaccinated child, die of small- pox, he naturally spreads abroad his disbelief in the operation. Considering the backward state of vaccination in Bahraich, Gonda and Sultánpur, great attention on the parts of the district officials is invited. I append a list of applicants to whom lymph has been supplied during 1893-94, from the circle under my charge. ALMORE: The 29th June 1894. W. G.

( 10A ) APPENDIX C. Annual Report on Vaccination in the 3rd Circle by SURGEON MAJOR G. M. J. GILES, Deputy Sanitary Commissioner. In submitting the subjoined remarks on the vaccine operations for the present year, it will be noted that the general system of organization has undergone very radical modifications during the period in question. In the first place the duration of the working season has been increased by continuing operations until the 15th of April. In the second place the direct control of the District staffs has been handed over to their respective Civil Surgeons, the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner being left with only a sort of auditing control. These changes are, however, too recent to exert any marked effect on the work of the individual vaccinator at present, and their full effect, whether for efficiency or the reverse, can only be judged in future years. Another new departure was that an attempt was instituted to keep up in each district, a supply of lymph throughout the hot weather. There is no doubt, that, if practicable, this plan would form a most valuable insurance against the chance of the supply of lymph cultivated in the hills breaking down, and I spared no efforts by means of repeated circulars and admonition to secure the success of the experiment. In spite of this however, I was constantly getting reports from one or the other districts of the supply having broken down, owing to the impossibility of keeping the vesicle intact till maturity. Whenever this took place fresh lymph was supplied, either from a neighbouring district, or by means of lanoline paste, and, as the weather grew cooler during the late rains that marked last autumn, I received assurances of the lymph being alive from most districts. In spite of this however, the spell of hot, dry weather that immediately preceded the commencement of work proved fatal to the vesicle in most districts, and went far to demonstrate the impracticability of the scheme in ordinary seasons,( 11A ) The percentage of success and of unknown cases coincide to a small fraction with those of previous year, the figures for the present year being 94.12 per cent success among known results( 12A ) cember were the only months during which I was free to tour for purposes of vaccine inspection. Moreover these two months were spent in thinly populated districts away from the main lines of traffic, where the children to be inspected were far and far between. In previous years the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner's presence at Allahabad during the Magh Mela has been only required for a few days only, and having no idea that I should be required for a longer period I planned my tour under the idea that, after inspecting these little frequented districts, I should still have a full three months of the most fruitful portion of the vaccination season for inspection work in the more populous districts. Practically, however, my time for vaccine inspections ended with the month of December, as during nearly the whole of February and the greater part of January, I was on duty in executive charge of the Kumbh Mela, and when I got once more on the road, my tour resolved itself into one of cholera investigation, necessarily along the main lines of road used by the dispersing pilgrims, the exigencies of which prevented my being able to effect more than a very trifling amount of vaccination inspection. The most practical result indeed of my second tour was the discovery of a most utter neglect of the villages near the main line of road in the Benares district, the vaccinators probably calculating on the known custom of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner to avoid the main lines of road. The largest increases reported are in the districts of Fatehpur 6,422, Basti 10,476 and Garhwál 4,306, while the smallest increases are recorded from Azamgarh 618, Gházipur 651, Ballia 695, and Mirzapur 1,065. In Ghazipur and Ballia the large number of operations performed by each vaccinator leaves comparatively little scope for improvement, and the other two are, it will be seen; the two so-called &quot; backward &quot; districts in which as I have already pointed out in this office No. 2311, dated 22nd December 1893, the real cause of the scanty results is the short-handedness of the vaccination staff in comparison with the exceptionally large area and population of these districts. The only point remaining for notice is the transfer of the control of District Vaccination staffs to Civil Surgeons. The increased inspecting power is, of course enormous( 13A ) APPENDIX D. No. 412 / V 267B-12 of 1893. RESOLUTION. SANITATION DEPARTMENT. Dated Naini Tal, the 23rd September 1893. READ( 14A ) that the annual return (No. III) of &quot; Dispensary Vaccination &quot; in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh is invariably blank: the Government has no information as to the extent to which dispensaries have been selected as vaccination offices under rule 2 of the rules for the enforcement of the Vaccination Act; but His Honor considers that the operation should be performed at all dispensaries throughout the Provinces, either by the officers in charge, or, if there is a large attendance of children, by the regular vac- cinators at stated hours. The subordinates of Civil Surgeons, the Assitsant Surgeons, and Hospital Assistants, should not hold themselves aloof from the work of vaccination, as is at present the case in many places, but should be considered ex-officio officers of the Vaccination Department, and should be called upon to assist in every way in their power. 3. As regards district vaccination, the case is different. As Health Officer of the district and as an inspecting officer representing the general administration of the district in the Medical and Sanitation Departments, the duties of the Civil Surgeon might be held to cover a general superintendence of the work of district vaccination; but this function has not hitherto been specially assigned to him in these Provinces. The system of control of vaccination by Civil Surgeons under the supervision of the Sanitary Commissioner has been adopted by other Governments and Administrations, such as Bengal, the Punjab, and the Central Povinces, and has worked well as the published figures show. In the Central Provinces, where the system of control by district medical officers has been in force since 1874, Civil Surgeons were on tour during the past year examining cases of vaccination for periods ranging from 26 to 64 days and inspect- ed in all 70,960 cases; in these Provinces the inspections by the three Deputy Com- missioners extended to 33,785 cases only, while the inspections by Deputy Superinten- dents and Native Superintendents fell far short proportionately of those undertaken by Native Superintendents in the Central Provinces. Excluding Deputy Sanitary Commissioners, the supervising staff in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh con- sists of one Native Superintendent to each district and one Deputy Superintendent to each division except Kumaun. The report on vaccination in these Provinces for the year 1892-93 shows that in some instances the Deputy Superintendents and Native Superin- tendents of the Vaccination Department have not co-operated with the district officials, who have been frequently directed to exercise all proper influence in the extension of vaccination, and without whose active assistance vaccination cannot be a success in back- ward tracts. For many reasons a change in the system in force in these Provinces is advisable. After consulting the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals and the Sanitary Commissioner, the Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Commissioner has decided to appoint, and hereby appionts, all officers in civil medical charge of districts to be ex-officio Su- perintendents of Vaccination within their respective districts in subordination to the Superintendent-General of Vaccination; His Honor is pleased to place under the control and orders of the Superintendents all vaccinators and other officials of the Department employed within such limits. The powers at present exercised by Deputy Sanitary Commissioners with reference to the appointment and punishment of these officers are transferred to medical officers in charge of districts. With the exception of the medical officers of the following districts( 15A ) officers will acquire a more intimate knowledge of the districts to which they are ap- pointed and will be better qualified than at present to act as the advisers of the district authorities in matters of sanitation. , During the absence of a Civil Surgeon from head- quarters, the charge of the District Jail will be assumed by one of the officers authorized to take charge under existing rules; care should be taken to arrange the tours in such a way that Civil Surgeons are not absent from headquarters during the visit of an inspect- ing officer. Separate orders will be issued with reference to the supply of tents and carriage. 4. As regards the existing staff of the Vaccination Department, a Deputy Superintendent in each division is unnecessary, and will not be maintained. The Lieute- nant-Governor and Chief Commissioner has decided to abolish the grade of Deputy Superintendent and the establishment of the Deputy Superintendents, and to change the designation of &quot; Native Superintendent &quot; to &quot; Assistant Superintendent.' At the same time, in order to provide a certain number of more highly paid appointments to which the subordinate officials of the Department may hope to rise, the grades of Assist- ant Superintendents will be revised. The present incumbents of the posts of Deputy Superintendent will be absorbed into the ranks of the Assistant Superintendents, but will continue to draw their present pay. The existing staff of Native Superintendents is divided equally into two grades, the first on Rs. 24 per mensem, and the second on Rs. 18 per mensem. The present sanctioned staff of Deputy Superintendents stands as follows :( 16A ) Superintendents should be made to understand that they form part of the district staff, and that they will be held responsible for the efficiency of the vaccination operations : frequent transfers should be avoided. 5. Though direct control of the vaccination staff is withdrawn from Deputy Sani- tary Commissioners, those officers will continue to inspect vaccination work within their respective circles, to verify the record of results, and to report on the progress of vaccination to the Superintendent-General. They will arrange, as hitherto, so far as may be necessary for the supply of lymph, and will be in special charge of the hill tracts ; their tours should cover especially those districts in which vaccination is back- ward or in which for special reasons the Civil Surgeon may be compelled to restrict his tours. All returns and annual reports should be submitted to the Sanitary Commis- sioner by Superintendents through the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner of the circle, so that the latter officer may be kept fully acquainted with the state of vaccination in his circle. As regards statistics all Superintendents of Vaccination of outlying muni- cipalities and of cantonments in which the Civil Surgeon is not Superintendent should submit the prescribed returns and annual reports to the District Superintendent of Vaccination, that is the Civil Surgeon, who will forward them to the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner : the rules for the enforcement of the Vaccination Act will be amended accordingly. The returns and reports hitherto submitted by Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioners to the Superintendent-General will now be submitted by District Superinten- dents of Vaccination. The District Superintendent of Vaccination should submit to the Superintendent-General through the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner of the circle a concise annual report divided into two portions :STATISTICAL STATEMENTS.

ORDERS OF GOVERNMENT. NO. 411/V-231B/2 -3 FROM THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, N.-W. PROVINCES AND OUDH, To THE SANITARY COMMISSIONER, N.-W. PROVINCES AND OUDH, DATED NAINI TAL, THE 25TH OCTOBER 1894. SIR, NITATION DEPT. I AM directed to acknowledge the receipt on the 24th Septem- ber 1894 of your report on Vaccination for the year ending the 31st March 1894. A triennial report was submitted in 1893, and the report for the year 1894-95 should have been confined to brief notes explanatory of the figures of the year. The standing orders on the subject have been overlooked by you, as your present report actually exceeds in bulk the triennial one. Total vaccina- tions (including re-vaccinations). Average, 1881-82 to 1890-91 ... ... 746,286 1891-92 ... ... 1,059,981 1892-93 ... ... 1,112,117 1893-94 ... ... 1,365,373 Successful primary vac- cinations. Under one year. Total, all ages. Average, 1881-82 to 1890-91 ... 302,688 646,374 1891-92 ... 378,512 877,351 1892-93 ... 424,016 945,364 1893-94 ... 521,879 1,181,600 Manual of Government Orders, Department V, Sanitation, page 91. 2. In the orders on last year's report it was noted that of recent years vaccination had made substantial pro- gress in these Provinces. This progress has conti- nued during the year under review, as the figures in the margin show. The number of re-vaccinations in 1893 was 25,662 against 24,362 in 1892. The number of vaccinators employed in 1893 was 848 against 824 in 1892, and the total expenditure was Rs. 1,58,996 against Rs. 1,54,484 in 1892. The increase in the expenditure occurred under the two heads of Travelling Allowances and Contingencies, and was due to the orders of Government which placed the direct control of vaccination in each dis- trict under the Civil Surgeon, and required him, except in nine specified districts where his medical duties are
( 2 ) exceptionally onerous, to spend from 30 to 60 days during the year on short tours for the purpose of inspecting the work of the district vaccin- ating staff. The report contains satisfactory evidence that these orders have already effected an improvement in the work, by subjecting the vaccinating staff to greater control and by reinforcing it with the local knowledge and influence of the district medical officer. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to find that Civil Surgeons have taken a keen interest in vaccination, and he is confident that they will prove themselves as zealous and efficient in this as in other of their important duties. Total popu- lation. Successful primary vaccinations in 1893-94. Ratio per 1,000 in 1893-94. Average ratio for previous five years. 1st Circle ... 10,335,834 308,171 30.0 25.0 2nd ( 3 ) Ratio for 1893-94. Ratio for 1892-93. Average, 1888-93.

The five Oudh districts which show the best results are Sitapur, Lucknow, Hardoi, Rae Bareli and Bara Banki; and it is clear from the report that these results were largely due to the interest taken by the Deputy Commissioners and Civil Surgeons in the matter. The thanks of Government are due to Mr. Mulock and Brigade-Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Hooper (Lucknow), Colonel Grigg and Surgeon-Major D. F. Barry (Sitapur), Mr. P. &quot;White and Surgeon- Major C. C. Vaid (Bara Banki), Colonel Quin and Surgeon-Captain W. G. P. Alpin (Hardoi), and Mr. Baillie and Mr. E. J. Simpson (Rae Bareli). Sanitary Commis- sioner's Report for 1893, pages 33B and 192B, 6. In the Third Circle there is still much room for improvement, and the Commissioners of the Allahabad, Benares and Gorakhpur Divisions will be directed to issue necessary instructions to the District Magis- trates. The ratio of 18 per mille of successful primary vaccinations recorded against Allahabad, the headquarters district of the Province, is altogether inadequate. According to the vital and mortuary returns there were over 45,000 child- ren under one year of age in the district in December 1893: but only 13,692 of these were successfully vaccinated. Jaunpur, Gorakhpur, Basti and Mirzapur have even lower ratios than Allahabad. In these four districts there were over 200,000 children under one year of age in December 1893, but only 15,901 of these were vaccinated. As to Azamgarh, where the ratio per mille is only 12.93, and where of 53,000 children under one year of age only 2,738 were vaccinated, the results are as bad as in the most backward district in Oudh. The vaccination staff is said to be wanting in energy and the members of the District Board give neither help nor countenance to it. The Government expects the District Magistrate and the Civil Surgeon to see that these grounds of complaint are removed. Total pri- mary vac- cinations. Successful primary vaccina- tions.

In the two other Circles vaccination lags far behind the annual addition to the population, and the vaccinating staff is chiefly employed on children between the ages of 1 and 6. In Oudh districts, where a serious effort has been made to extend vaccination, this is conspicuously the case. The contrasted figures, given in the margin, for the two districts of Aligarh and Sitapur are very instructive. In either district the infant population under one year of age in December 1893 was close on 40,000. In Aligarh three infants in every four of those under one year of age were vaccinated: in Sitapur one in every four. This explains why vaccinations between the ages of one and six are so few in Aligarh and so numerous in Sitapur. In Aligarh vaccination is almost abreast of the annual addition to the population. *Shahdera. Hápur. Pilkhuwa. Mowána. Bhinga. Municipal population. Successful primary vaccinations. Under one year.

The ratios for Bareilly (43), Fyzabad (35), Saháranpur (38), Aligarh (37) are good: those for Agra (31), Allahabad (32), Gorakhpur (27), Benares (29) leave room for improvement. 9. In many municipalities the requirements of the Act and of the rules made under it are indifferently observed. The registers are not accurately kept up, certificates are not regularly granted, notices are not issued, or, if issued, compliance with them is not strictly enforced. Com- missioners of Divisions should now draw the attention of the District Magistrate and the District Superintendent of Vaccination to the matter in all cases in which the district summaries bring such defects to notice. In paragraph 67 of your report and in the appended report of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner in charge of the First Circle the difficulty of strictly complying with section 17 of the Act, which requires the Superintendent of Vaccination in a municipal area to ascertain by personal house inquiry whether a parent or guardian has omitted to present his child for vaccination, is remarked on. As Civil Surgeons have in headquarter municipalities been appointed Superintendents under the Act, the difficulty no doubt exists. There is however no immediate prospect of the Act being amended, and meanwhile it is found in most places productive of very considerable results. The rules under the Act are further alleged to be defective in prescribing public vaccina- tion stations, whereas house-to-house visitation is still the predominant practice. But the rules do not prohibit this practice, and they leave it to the Municipal Board to fix the hours of daily attendance of the vaccinators at the public station. The attendance can be so fixed as to give the staff ample time for house-to-house visitation. The Superin- tendent of the First Circle also objects to the municipal vaccinators being prohibited from working beyond the limits of their circle. This prohibition is not contained in the rules, and it is for the District Su- perintendent of Vaccination to represent to the Municipal Board the impolicy of such restriction, if he finds the municipal vaccinators can conveniently undertake outside work. 10. The experiment of continuing vaccination operations in the plains throughout the hot weather, with the object of keeping up in each district a supply of lymph instead of obtaining it from the hill dis- tricts each cold weather, cannot be said to have been successful, and it is evidently most unpopular. You should now report whether you consider the experiment is worth continuing. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner in charge of the First Circle considers that a calf lymph depôt for that Circle is much needed. There is no reason why one should not be started, and he should be requested to take up the matter. As such a depôt has been established in Bareilly in connection with the dairy farm, one might possibly be started at Aligarh in connection with the dairy farm of that place, but under the management of the Civil Surgeon of Aligarh. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner in charge of the Second Circle appears to consider that a similar institution should be established in the hills from which bovine lymph preserved in lano- line paste might be issued to plains districts. You should report as to
( 6 ) the practicability and cost of this proposal. Almora would probably be a suitable station. In other provinces the use of bovine lymph is year by year more largely resorted to, as there is much evidence that with the cessation of the arm-to-arm process vaccination is less disliked by the people. In the Panjáb the plan of vaccinating a village calf with the consent of the owner and obtaining from it points of fresh vaccine to vaccinate the village has proved very successful. His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor will be glad if some Civil Surgeons when on tour will give it a trial. Bovine depôts are most numerous in Oudh. The conclusions regarding them appear to be that they are useful in a large city like Lucknow, where there is a large demand for fresh lymph, but that calf lymph unless preserved in paste cannot be advantageously sent to a distance. Issues of calf lymph in paste were experimentally made from the Lucknow bovine depôt. The experi- ment should be continued and the results noticed in next year's report. 11. Your remarks (paragraph 82) on the comparative immunity from small-pox which the Province enjoyed during the year and on the decreasing virulence of periodical outbreaks of the disease have been read with interest. In parts of the Province the feeling of the people with regard to vaccination has changed of recent years from dislike and dread to acquiescence and to positive approval. In Oudh and the eastern districts the old prejudices have as yet lost little of their force. That they will give way in time is not to be doubted. But in the meantime sustained attention and effort are required, and His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor trusts that in those districts which are shown to be backward the local authorities will see that improvement is effected. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, T. W. HOLDERNESS, Secy. to Govt., N.- W. P. and Oudh.

ANNUAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH, For the year 1894-95. Continued activity and progress in vaccination. 1. THE activity and progress in vaccination, noted in previous reports, and which have characterized vaccine operations in the North- Western Provinces and Oudh for some years, are still plainly manifest. The success of the ' operations in the united provinces in recent years. 2. Since 1889-90 the annual number of persons primarily vaccinated has risen from 785,957 to the large total of 1,396,849 and the annual number of primary successful vaccinations from 700,429 to 1,247,704. The results how obtained. 3. These important results have been accompanied by a steady elimination of what formerly was irregular and false in the vaccina- tion record, and by the summary dismissal from the service of any one found fabricating or tampering with departmental records. The suspicion, therefore, which formerly attached to the work of the department can no longer exist when it is shown that under the new system of extensive check and test of results by Civil Surgeons no irregularities of importance have been discovered. Distribution of the establishment. 4. The distribution of the vaccination estab- lishment during 1894-95 was as follows :( 2 ) in the previous year, and there was an increase of 6 in the number of probationers The total working staff numbered 878 against 892 in the previous year. Expenditure on vaccination. 5. A decrease of Rs. 3,210-7-8 in expenditure is shown and the disbursement from Provincial and Local Funds was less by Rs. 3,335-4-7. There was a slight increase in municipal expenditure. The total expenditure on vaccination was Rs. 155,786-2-2 as compared with Rs. 158,996-9-10 in the previous year. The sources of disbursement and heads of expendi- ture for 1893-94 and 1894-95 are compared in the following tables :( 3 ) District. Number of successful primary vaccinations. Increase.

There was thus a substantial increase of 20,232 in the number of successful primary- vaccinations in the circle. Cause of the decrease in some districts. 10. The decrease in the Dehra Dún and Saháranpur districts was mainly due to the deputation, early in March of the vaccinators of those districts to Hardwár for special sanitary duty in connection with the Mahavarni Fair, and in Etáwah to heavy and prolonged rain, which prevented work in that district at the commencement of the season. Summary of District Superintendents' reports. 11. Vaccination in the district and municipalities of Agra shows steady progress; owing, it is stated, to the zeal and activity of the Assistant Superintendent. The falling off in the Dehra Dún and the Saháranpur districts was due to the cause already stated. The District Superintendent of Saháranpur reports that he &quot; did not succeed in discovering a single false entry in district registers.'&quot; Operations were also interfered with in the Muzaffarnagar district, owing to the deputation of the district vaccinators for sanitary duty at Hardwár ; and the Superintendent refers to the inability of the Assistant Superintendent and vaccinators to help in enforcing the provisions of the Vaccination Act in municipalities. A considerable advance was made in the Meerut district and in the Meerut municipality, and the opposition and prejudices of the Jats to the operation seem to have disappeared. There was an increase in the number of successful operations in the Bulandshahr district, and progress was reported in the municipa- lities. In the Aligarh district, the previous year's success was fully maintained and the Superintendent says that &quot; the unprotected children are very few and far to seek.&quot; In the municipality of Koil-Aligarh, there is little difficulty experienced in carrying out the provisions of the Vaccination Act. An increase is noted in the work in the municipalities and in the district of Muttra. There was a falling off in the work of the municipality and the district of Etáwah, attributed to delay at the com- mencement of the season during the time when the flooded state of the country prevented the vaccinators from moving about freely. A slight increase in operations in the Mainpuri district is noted. In the municipality of Mainpuri some opposition was experienced in enforcing the provisions of the Act. In the Farukhabad district, there was a slight decrease in the total number of vaccinations in the district, and a slight increase in the number of successful primary cases. In the Etah district, operations were considerably extended and prosecutions under the Vaccination Act in the muni- cipality of Etah were not rendered necessary. Operations in the II Circle. 12. There was a total of 631,509 persons vaccinated in the II Circle against 616,511, and the number of successful primary vac- cinations was 538,697 against 515,997, in the previ- ous season. The percentage of successful primary cases in which the results were known rose from 90.97 to 91.67, and the number of persons vaccinated per 1,000 of the
( 4 ) population from 27.69 to 28.84, while the average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator was 1,799, as compared with 1,693 of the previous year. Table showing the increase and de- crease in successful vaccination by dis- tricts. 13. The following; table shows the increase and decrease in the number of successful primary vaccinations in the various districts of the II Circle :( 5 ) working staff, and the lack of control over the vaccinators employed and paid by the Kapurthala estate, which has been the subject of correspondence. The decrease in the number of successful primary vaccinations in the Bijnor district was greatly due to the employment of the vaccination staff during March, on sanitary duty at Hardwár, and the slight falling off in the Naini Tal district is ascribed to the sickliness of the season and to the considerable increase in infantile mortality which was unusually great in the province in 1894. Summary of District Superintendents' reports. 15. In the Almora and Naini Tal districts the slight falling off in successful results was due to the unhealthiness of the season and to the excessive infantile mortality in 1894. It is satisfactory to note that this cause did not operate extensively in diminishing successful operations in the province generally. The District Superintendent of Naini Tal records the fact that &quot; It was a very rare thing to find a child over four months, or adults under 30 years of age, who had no mark of vaccination.&quot; Operations in the Bijnor district were as stated interfered with in March by the withdrawal of vaccina- tors for sanitary duty at Hardwár; and the District Superintendent states &quot; As a matter of fact during my tour, though I made a point of examining elder children, I found it quite rare to find any that were unprotected.&quot; In the Moradabad district the satisfactory results of previous years were maintained. There was a considerable increase in successful vaccinations in the Budaun district, due to the exertions of the Civil Surgeon and assistance given by the district authorities. The attitude of the people in the Bareilly district was not so unfavourable as in previous years; and the results showed a satisfactory increase. A substantial increase in successful primary vaccinations was recorded in the Pilibhít and Sháhjahánpur districts. An explanation of the falling off in results in the Lucknow district has been given. The calf lymph depôt at Lucknow was worked satisfactorily, but its supervision is inadequate. The satisfactory results of the previous year's operations in the Unao district were fully maintained. It has been customary to employ extra vaccinators in the Bara Banki district; and, as the work of such men is generally unsatisfactory, it was pointed out to the District Superintendent that the entertainment of such men should be stopped, and thus owing to fewer vaccinators being employed the work fell off somewhat, as also in the Rae Bareli district from the same cause. The falling off in results in the Sitapur district is stated to be due to &quot; the epidemic of cholera which prevailed almost during the whole of 1894 and even in the early months of 1895, and to the employment of vaccinators on special medical and sanitary duty,&quot; and to other causes as already noted. A great increase in successful primary vaccinations in the Hardoi district is recorded. There was a considerable advance in vaccination in the Kheri district, but greater energy is necessary on the part of the vaccination staff. There was an increase in successful vaccination in the Fyzabad district, and Dr. Sweeny remarks with regard to the work in the district that:( 6 ) Table showing the increase and de- crease in successful vaccination by dis- tricts. 17.

There was thus a substantial increase of 23,172 in the number of successful primary vaccinations in the circle. Cause of the decrease in successful vaccination in some districts. 18. The decrease in the Garhwál and Fatehpur districts was due to general causes, and the unhealthiness of the infant popula- tion in 1894. The falling off in the number of successful vaccinations in the Allahabad district is ascribed to less activity in the operations in Allahabad city, where fewer infants were as elsewhere available than in the previous season in the proportion of 5,439 against 6,891 in 1893-94. Work in the Mirzapur district was interfered by the frequent transfers of the District Superin- tendents, and consequently the supervision of the working staff was not altogether satisfactory. Summary of District Superintendents' reports. 19. The lymph supply in the Garhwál district was of good quality, and, as supplied from this source to the districts of the III Circle at the commencement of the season, gave good results. In the Cawnpore municipality, difficulty was experienced in serving notices, and a large number of summonses under the Vaccination Act were returned by the police, with the report that the names were not traceable. The Fateh- pur returns show a slight increase in work in the district, and a falling off in the municipality, due to fewer infants being available. The District Superintendent of Bánda obtained a &quot; running supply&quot; of lanoline vaccine paste from Mysore estab- lishment, and says the results far exceeded expectations; and of 426 inoculations with the paste &quot;416 proved successful, the resulting cicatrices being absolutely typical and faultless.&quot; There was a considerable increase in successful operations in the Hamírpur, Jaunpur, Azamgarh and Gorakhpur districts, and a large increase in the Basti dis-
( 7 ) trict. The inoculation of small-pox is noted in the reports as still practised in the Basti and Gorakhpur districts. There were frequent changes as noted of the District Superintendents in the Mirzapur district, and the work and discipline suffered in con- sequence. In the Benares Municipality, of the 3,834 infants over six months and under one year old, 3,003 or 78 per cent were successfully vaccinated, a great improve- ment on the work of previous seasons. The rules as regards compulsory vaccination are now fully complied with in the Gházipur Municipality. It is noted that &quot; inoculation is still practised in the district by professional inoculators, who come yearly during the hot weather from Purneah in Bengal; but these operations have been put a stop to as far as the city of Gházipur is concerned.&quot; Successful results in the Ballia district were fully maintained, but the work would be materially increased if the district vac- cinators showed a little more zeal and energy. Work was fairly satisfactory in the Jhánsi and Jalaun districts. General results of the operations in the three circles compared. 20. In the I Circle, the average number of persons vaccinated by each vacci- nator was 1,822, as compared with 1,799 in the II, and 1,544 in the III Circle; and the number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of the population was 31.99; 28.84 and 21.72 respectively. Vaccination according to age. 21. A total of 562,093 infants were successfully vaccinated against 521,879 in the previous season. The increase in the season of 40,214 shows satisfactory progress, when it is consi- dered that the compulsory vaccination of infants under the age of six months is not permitted. It is statistically incorrect to compare the results of infant vaccination in the united provinces, where, as stated, compulsory vaccination is not permitted under the age of six months and only compulsory among one-twelfth of the population, with those of the United Kingdom and elsewhere, where vaccination is altogether compul- sory before the age of three months. Vaccination in proportion to births. 22. The percentage of successful primary vaccinations of infants to births was 30.19 as compared with 27.17 in the previous sea- son ; and the percentage of total vaccinated to births rose from 71.08 to 76.39. Re-vaccination. 23. A total of 4,639 re-vaccinations were performed in the I; 4,989 in the II and 16,002 in the III Circle; and the total for the province was 25,630, or nearly the same number as in the previous season. The supply of humanised lymph. 24. Vaccination in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh is almost wholly accomplished on the arm-to-arm system with human- ised lymph; and the supply as furnished by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners was reported almost invariably to be sufficient and of good quality. Animal lymph. 25. Calf vaccine was used to a very limited extent in the I Circle, and a total of 96 successful cases only were reported from Meerut, Aligarh, Agra and Mainpuri. In the II Circle 17,988 operations were performed with calf vaccine, with a percentage of 82.57 suc- cessful results. In the III Circle, calf vaccine was used only in Allahabad city and the operations numbered 5,662 with the percentage of successful cases of 84.82. Inspection of operations. 26. The total number of cases inspected by Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and by District Superintendents was 144,460 as com- pared with 137,666 and by Assistant Superinten- dents of Vaccination 408,256 against 373,638 in the previous season. It is satisfac- tory to note an increase, especially in Oudh, in the percentage of cases found success- ful of total number inspected.
( 8 ) Vaccination in the hot weather and rains. 27. Voluntary, that is altogether optional, vaccination to a limited extent was con- tinued throughout the hot weather and rains, as in the previous year, with a certain amount of success. The opposition of vaccinators and others to continue the work beyond the usual season in each district interferes with progress in this direction ; but no difficulty is anticipated in keeping up a fresh supply of good vaccine lymph throughout the year in each district. Localities in which the Vaccination Act is in force. 28. The Vaccination Act is now in force in all the municipalities and canton- ments of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh ; and the provisions of the Act, in view of its recent introduction into most localities, are, on the whole, very satisfactorily carried out. Vaccination and small-pox. 29. For the past three years, the mortality from small-pox in the united pro- vinces has reached a minimum, and the total number of deaths from the disease was 7,709 ; 5,992 and 4,443 in 1892, 1893 and 1894 respectively. During the same period the annual number of successful primary vaccinations has risen from 945,364 to 1,247,704, corresponding to annual increase of 302,340 in successful primary operations. Relative number of successful primary vaccinations, and of deaths from small- pox for a series of years. 30.

The diagrams which follow indicate (1) the death-rate from small-pox in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh from 1876 to 1894, and the marked decline in the mortality from the disease of late years; (2) the relation between the death-rate from small-pox and the proportion of the population protected by vaccination. Marked progress in vaccination. 32. Marked progress in vaccination is shown (1) in securing successful vaccina- tion over the wide area of the North-Western Pro- vinces and Oudh, with a population of 47,146,033 souls (a large proportion of the people having until lately been actively hostile to the operation), and (2) in the reduction of the death-rate from small-pox as indicated by the successive annual minima of mortality from the disease. The attempt therefore to question and depreciate the results obtained must now be silenced, as the vaccination record has been carefully scrutinised and tested by a large and expert staff during the past two seasons. The success secured is as satisfactorily established as that of the great sanitary works pushed to completion in the united provinces within the past few years. The results of arm-to-arm vaccination in these provinces are now almost altogether successful. With a little more care and effort, and the employment of only carefully-trained and expert vaccinators on the permanent establishment, successful vaccination by this the safest and most satisfactory method will extend to every child in the province. The reorganization scheme, while securing increased and adequate supervision of the now extensive field of operations in the rural as well as the urban area has, as a result, definitely proved the efficiency of the Vaccination Department of the united provinces.

FROM THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, N.-W. PROVINCES AND OUDH, To THE SANITARY COMMISSIONER, N.-W. PROVINCES AND OUDH. DATED NAINI TAL, THE 15TH OCTOBER 1895. ATION DEPT. SIR, I AM directed to acknowledge the receipt, on 22nd September 1895, of the report on Vaccination in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh for the year 1894-95. The date fixed for its submission is the 1st July, and it was therefore two and a half months late; consi- derable time was occupied in Press, and efforts should be made to secure its punctual submission. 2. In the following table the work of the year is contrasted with that done in the two previous years:( 2 ) small proportion of the population was vaccinated, continued attention is required. The vaccination staff shown in column 6 of Statement I is not confined to that supplied by Government, but includes municipal and town vaccinators as well as those maintained by public subscriptions. There are at present considerable inequalities in the distribution of the staff supplied by Government, but when these are removed, it will be possible for no district to urge an insufficient staff as an excuse for a short output of work. It is possible (though in this respect the opportunities vary in different districts) to supplement by local effort the staff which Government supplies, and which, owing to financial considerations, is admittedly insufficient to cope with the work. For instance, considerable sums in addition to those provided by Govern- ment (from Provincial or Local funds) or municipalities were collected in the districts of Sitapur, Bara Banki, Rae Bareli, Bahraich, Fyzabad, and Lucknow. The Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Commissioner hopes that every effort will be made by backward districts to act up to the example thus afforded. It is especially necessary in the 3rd Circle, where the number of persons successfully vaccinated per mille is only 21.72 as against the provincial figure of 26.81. 3. The result of the re-organization of the vaccination staff which came into force during the previous year, an important feature of which was the appointment of each Civil Surgeon to be the head of the department in the district to which he is attached, has been a very large increase in the number of cases tested by the superior staff:( 3 ) character of his duties, is unable to do much work in testing vaccina- tion operations. From the fact that only 72 were tested at Benares it would appear that the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner was unable to visit the district; he should endeavour to do so during the coming season. Similar remarks apply to the Lucknow district. 4. The proportion of cases of vaccination of infants to the total number of successful primary operations has increased but slightly, and now stands at 45 as compared with 44 in 1892-93. About one- third of the infant population was protected. No efforts should be spared to increase the number of infants vaccinated. The remarks in paragraph 21 of the report that the compulsory vaccination of infants under the age of six months is not permitted, and in paragraph 27 with regard to the voluntary character of vaccination in the hot weather and rains, are incorrect as implying that, as a general rule, vaccination is compulsory; it is compulsory nowhere but in municipalities. An increase of cases of revaccination at the expense of primary operations is to be deprecated in view of the necessity of concentrating effort on the latter. It is possible that too much work in this direction was done in Gorakhpur, where, however, the tendency is to restrict the number of secondary operations. The outturn of revaccination in Garhwál accounts for more than half the total number of cases in the provinces; in the other hill districts it was not found necessary to revaccinate to any large extent. 5. Except in the 3rd Circle, where 17,988 operations were per- formed, little resort was had to the use of calf lymph. Where care is taken to supervise the depôt fair results seem to be obtained, percentages of successful cases of 82.57 and 84.52 being obtained at Allahabad and Lucknow. Unless operations are conducted on a fairly extensive scale, these depôts seem to be of questionable utility. At Aligarh, for instance, where a small depôt was started, out of 72 children vaccinated with calf lymph the cases of only 31 were successful. There is considerable difference of opinion as to the desirability of continuing vaccination operations during the hot weather. Your predecessor was in favour of the measure. In the report of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner of the 1st Circle it is said that all the Civil Surgeons of his circle are adverse to the practice, and he himself is of opinion that it would be preferable to stop operations after the 31st March, if a calf lymph depôt were established for each circle. I am to request that, should you consider that sufficient experience has been gained of the working of the system which has been in force during the last two years, you will take the question into careful consideration after consulting Civil Surgeons. 6. The Vaccination Act is now in force in all the municipalities of the provinces except Bhinga; but it seems clear that in the majority of them full effect is not given to its provisions. Statistics for vaccinations performed within the municipal area are not available before the year 1892-93, when the provisions of the Act were first enforced in about 65 municipalities, being extended to the remainder later. But it is possible
( 4 ) to gain some idea of the work performed by a scrutiny of the figures in Statement IV for cases due to vaccinators paid from municipal funds. These cases include work done beyond the municipal area, but it is not the case, as might have been expected, that operations performed beyond the municipal area diminish while those performed within it increase. The subjoined table gives the main results:( 5 ) (about 20 per cent. of infants die), in 31 of the 102 municipalities this undesirable result occurs. Below are given instances of the vary- ing results obtained :
