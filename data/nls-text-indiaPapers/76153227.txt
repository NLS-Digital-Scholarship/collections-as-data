In some few districts the villagers are still opposed to this method of treatment, but the good results obtained will, I think, soon overcome their pre- judices. The staff employed in the districts is at present insufficient to cope with the work. Of the 33 districts in the Province, 27 have 1 Veterinary Assistant in each, 1 has 2 and 1 only has 3 Veterinary Assistants, and the remaining 4 have none. Of these 32 Veterinary Assistants, 20 are in charge of dispensaries and 12 only are itinerating. To ensure prompt and effective measures being taken for prevention and suppression of outbreaks, it is absolutely necessary to increase the itinerating staff, and this will be done as soon as men are available and the District Boards can find funds. At present 4 Veterinary Assistants with sufficient experience are employed in my reserve staff, and temporary veterinary aid was given by me to the districts named in the margin, by deputing these officers to inoculate cattle with anti-rinderpest serum and to give advice as to the preventive measures to be adopted. Five Veterinary Assistants received training in rinderpest inoculation at the Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory at Bareilly. 6. Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries.(3) years, as they are still in their infancy. The demand was chiefly for bulls of a milch strain, and as an experimental measure I obtained the permission of the Inspector-General, Indian Civil Veterinary Department, to advise a limited number of local bodies to secure a few of the Montgomery breed (as there are no milch cattle in the ordinary acceptation of the term in this Province). Very unfortunately out of a small batch of 8 which I got down from the Amritsar Fair, Punjab, only a couple of them will serve. Two of them have been kept at Belgachia, and all attempts to induce them to bull have proved futile. Whether this is due to climatic or other influences I am not in a position to say, although I think it is not improbable that they were sent for sale to Amritsar by people who were fully aware that they were useless as stud animals. Under the circumstances and as the cost of bringing them down is more or less prohibitive, it would be inadvisable to continue the experiment until we are able to secure bulls which are known to be actually good servers. I fancy the only way this could be satisfactorily done would be to go to the villages where they are bred and buy direct from the cattle owners. Whilst on the subjects of bulls, I deem it advisable to publish that there are other factors of equal, if not of more importance to be considered, when trying to improve the cattle of the Province. I have now seen a great many of this class of stock in Bengal, and to my mind endeavours to get owners to pay more attention to their cows and heifers is about the most primary matter to be thought out, although I fear it would be a most difficult one to carry into effect. There are numbers of Brahmini bulls in the Province, the offsprings of which are to be seen everywhere. And, although the Brahmini bulls may be far from perfect, there are many amongst them active and strong, and in most ways suitable to produce the agricultural bullock the rayat requires. In fairs it is common to find their stock amongst the dozens of good plough and fair numbers of excellent cart bullocks. If old, malformed and otherwise un- desirable cattle could be prevented from being used to breed from, if cows and heifers had the same attention paid to them which is paid to the male stock, and if there were greater facilities for grazing, we would soon have a less demand for bulls. Without any intention of making disparaging remarks, I wish to observe that District Boards and others seem to consider that, as soon as they have succeeded in securing and placing a good bull in a neighbourhood or area, that they have immediately conferred a great boon to the cattle owners of that area. No doubt this is perfectly true; but if any really good results are to be expected from him (the bull), the cows and stock should be placed under the conditions I have just mentioned. The bull is far too frequently held responsible for the too numerous needy and bad stock seen about the country, whereas he oftener is the last animal to blame. 10. (ii).

During the current year there should not be quite so large a deficit, as we ought to be able to put a fair amount of our land under grass and crops. OUTSTANDING ACCOUNTS. 14. The outstanding sum of Rs. 83-12 shown in the last year's reports was realised during the year. The outstanding accounts of 1905-06 amounts to Rs. 287-2. This amount represents the fees of the treatment of animals dis- charged towards the close of the year, and is expected to be realised very shortly. THE HOSTEL. 15. The students as usual lived in the hostel, and, with the exception of I couple of cases of small-pox, their general health was good. Unfortunately have again to report that no additional accommodation has been made during the year. As what, we have is uncomfortably limited, and fearing that several of the new candidates might leave the premises for want of better quarters,(9) 19. Out of this work, it is much to be regretted that the Public Works Department have only been able to complete one item, viz., the dissecting house. It was only in March they saw their way to commence the erection of the horse isolation boxes, the operation theatre part of the boundary wall and filling in of a couple of tanks. GENERAL. 20. During the year under report we had to labour under great difficulties through the inadequacy of our teaching staff, due to the absence on furlough of Mr. Burke, Assistant Principal, and want of an Imperial officer who could devote his whole time to the college. The latter case was fully recognised by the Examining Board, who remarked that "it is absolutely impossible for the Imperial officer holding a dual appointment to give time and atten- tion necessary to turn out good smart practical men." The inadequacy of the staff was represented shortly after I took over charge of this office, and the matter was included when discussing the reorganization scheme of this depart- ment in Bengal at a Conference under the Chairmanship of Hon'ble Mr. L. Hare in January 1905. That Conference urged the importance of appointing an Imperial officer whose sole time should be devoted to the college. This recommendation was sanctioned in October last, but as the officer selected did not put in his appearance until February, it was obviously of little use his taking up any teaching at the termination of the session. Besides, he was nominated a member of the Examining Board, shortly after his arrival in Calcutta, and as a member of that Board he could not be a Principal, Professor or a Lecturer of any college or school. It may be mentioned that, as the particular officer sent here was a complete stranger to India and without any experience of routine work, etc., etc., he has been placed under me for general training before he can be appointed to assume charge of an important and responsible office. To further emphasize the want of at least another officer who could devote his time to this work, Major Raymond, in June 1903, said his staff were then working at high pressure, and as a result most of them were either actually on the sick list or showing the effects of a long and arduous session. At that time there were four lecturers on the staff, two of them European to teach a total of thirty students. This year we had one European and three native lecturers with one native lecturer on probation to educate the maximum number of students the college has reached in our session, viz., 142 students. Although further comment appears to me to be unnecessary, I feel it incumbent on me to place on record my conviction that, even with the return of Mr. Burke and the appointment of an Imperial officer whose solo duties are to be in connection with the college, the appointment of the second Imperial officer for the college is urgently required. 21. If we are to cope this year with the suppression of glanders and farcy over the enormous area of Calcutta and its suburbs and also epizootic lymphangitis and surra, there is still a greater necessity to employ a second Imperial officer in the college. I must remind you again that the Punjab have not less than six Imperial officers conducting veterinary work and cattle- breeding. It should behove Bengal too, when agriculture is most extensively carried on, to see that it has a proportionate complement of Imperial officers to help it to progress in veterinary work and cattle-breeding. 22. The important question of the education of the candidates seeking admission has been considered lately. I made particular note during the year that youths with the small educational qualifications hitherto accepted as suffi- cient should no longer be admitted. So anticipating that the reorganisation scheme of this department with its proposed enhanced rates of pay will come into force long before the new candidates of 1906-07 will graduate, I con- sulted with the other members of the College Committee, and got their per- mission to try and obtain Government sanction to pass a rule to raise the standard of educational qualifications for admission to the college. This was sanctioned, and the rule is now in force. A. S. TRYDELL, CAPTAIN, Supdt., Civil Veterinary Dept., Bengal, and Principal, Bengal Veterinary College.

[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] AGRICULTURE. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] DARJEELING, THE 26TH AUGUST 1906. RESOLUTION No. 1843T.-R. READ(2) 4. There were altogether 530 cases of deaths from glanders and farcy in the Province during the year as against 430 in the previous year, excluding the figures for the transferred districts. Of these, 473 occurred in Calcutta and its neighbourhood as against 413 reported during the preceding year. Steps having been taken to enforce the Glanders and Farcy Act in the metropolis and its suburbs, it is probable that a larger number of patients suffering from the disease will be brought to notice in future than at present. 5. The total number of deaths from cattle disease was 12,374 as against 12,276 during the preceding year, excluding the figures for the transferred districts. Of these, by far the largest number of deaths (9,023) was caused by rinderpest. The districts which suffered most from the disease were Burdwan, Darjeeling, Shahabad, the Sonthal Parganas, Balasore, Ranchi, Palamau, Manbhum and Sambalpur. The Superintendent complains of the defective reports regarding cattle diseases supplied to his department by the Police officers of the Province. The Inspector-General of Police will be requested to take such steps as are possible to remedy this. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to notice that cattle inoculation is gradually gaining ground in the Province, the number of inoculations performed during the year being 22,613 as against 13,276 during the previous year. 6. Veterinary Infirmary, Belgachia.(3) 14 in the new Province of Eastern Bengal and Assam, as compared with 54 during the previous year. Captain Trydell inspected all the dispensaries with the exception of that at Ranchi, and it appears from the report that, on the whole, they worked satisfactorily. The only dispensaries which have been unfavourably reported on are those at Howrah and Patna. The latter was badly reported on in the previous year. The Lieutenant-Governor hopes that the Municipality will take notice of the conduct of the Veterinary Assistant in charge. The unfavourable results achieved are reported to be due to his apathy in furthering the objects of the dispensary. It is stated that the Veterinary Assistants in charge of dispensaries generally worked satis- factorily, the most prominent among them being those in charge of the Dumraon, Burdwan, Larpur and Palamau dispensaries. 10. The Lieutenant-Governor has much pleasure in acknowledging the zeal and ability with which Captain Trydell managed the Department during the year under report, and considers that he deserves great credit for the progress which has been made in its development. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, R. W. CARLYLE, Chief Secy. to the Govt. of Bengal. B. S.
