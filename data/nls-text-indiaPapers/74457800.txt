From Commissioner, Benares Division, to Secretary to Government, North-Western Provinces (No. 212).-Dated the 18th August, 1869. SIR,-I have the honour to submit, for the information and orders of Govern- ment, the accompanying letter, with enclosure, from the Magistrate of Ghazeepore, reporting a serious outbreak of cholera in the town of Suhutwar, in the Bulliah Sub- Division. 2.     Mr. Pasley informed me demi-officially on the 5th instant, that a report had been received to the effect that 300 persons had died from cholera at this place, but in a subsequent note doubt was expressed as to the  truth of the report.    I men- tioned the subject in one of my demi-official notes to  you,  and I have only to-day received the enclosed official communication. 3.    The last entry in the Native Doctor's statement is for the   14th, and  shews that on   that day   24 deaths  had  occurred.    From the appended remarks it would appear that all efforts to check the disease had failed,  and  that every case had  been fatal. 4.     Suhutwar, where this outbreak of disease has occurred, is a large place, con- taining upwards of 8,000 inhabitants, and it may be presumed that the zemindars and principal residents are men of some position and intelligence.    This, therefore, seems to be a case in which some measures might fairly be adopted to prove that we are thoroughly in earnest in regard to sanitary reform.   Persuasion and advice have evi- dently been thrown away, for it appears that both the Magistrate of the District and the Officer in charge of the Bulliah Sub-Division endeavoured during the last cold season to impress on the inhabitants the advantage of cleanliness, and were  met  by childish excuses and passive resistance. 5.    Placed in this position,  with  cholera "raging furiously, "the   Magistrate prays to have his hands strengthened so that he may be able to "compel the adoption of proper sanitary measures in any village,   the  zemindars of which either neglected or refused to listen to and act on his advice on the matter."    The  Magistrate would also wish to be invested with power "to enforce some quarantine rules in those   vil- lages in which cholera may become epidemic." 6.     In his concluding paragraph Mr. Pasley refers to the Bulliah Fair,  which is held within 14 miles from Suhutwar; and suggests for the   consideration  of Govern- ment whether, in the event of cholera continuing to prevail at Suhutwar, the Fair should not be put a stop to this year.    About 21/2 months hence people will begin to collect  at Bulliah, but we may reasonably hope that  before  that  time cholera will have  dis- appeared.   Should it prevail in the neighbourhood, either the infected villages should be placed in quarantine, or the Bulliah Fair stopped, unless we are prepared to run most serious risk on that occasion. 7.    Under proper management, there is no reason why disease should break  out in the Bulliah Fair itself.    The locality is a peculiarly open and healthy one, and   I would therefore recommend  that, if necessary, a  cordon be  drawn  round infected villages rather than that this large religious gathering should be interfered with. I have, &c., A. SHAKESPEAR, Commissioner. 1
(   2   ) From Magistrate of Ghazeepore, to Commissioner, Benares Division (No. 117).-Dated Ghazeepore, the 17th August, 1869. SIR,-I brought to your notice demi-officially about a week ago that I had received a report to the effect that cholera was very prevalent at Mouzah Suhutwar, in the Bulliah Sub-Division of this district. The report then received was from Inspec- tor Hussun Ruzza, and was to the effect that 300 people had died of cholera. Imme- diately on the report being read to him, Mr. Horne, in charge of the Bulliah Sub-Division, sent out orders by sowar that the Tehseelee Peshkar and Native Doctor at Bulliah were to proceed at once to Suhutwar, taking cholera pills with them; that the former was to employ himself in having the village thoroughly cleaned up, while the latter was to attend to the sick. At the same time orders were sent to Inspector Hussun Ruzza to ascertain and report the exact number of deaths from cholera that had occuried on each several date. No full report has been received till to-day, when a report was received from the Native Doctor, Khyrath Ali, copy of which I enclose for your information. I am doing all in my power, with the assistance and advice of Doctor Jameson, Civil Surgeon, to try and prevent the spread of the disease to other places, and also to provide medicines for the sick. A Native Doctor is being sent to Suhutwar. 2.    The village of Suhutwar is a notoriously filthy place.    It is a large village of 8,300 inhabitants.    The zemindars not only neglect the commonest rules of sanita- tion, but, when spoken to on the subject and advised as to the steps they should take to prevent the constant stench around their village, raise some absurd objections as to a fuqeer  having pronounced a curse on any one who should attempt to clean up any particular spot.    I was at this village during last cold  weather with the object of selecting a site for an Anglo-Vernacular  school building, and was very much struck with the extremely filthy state of the place.   I suggested the cleansing and repairing of a tank, the neighbourhood of which I considered a good situation for the school-house, but the zemindars raised the objections above-mentioned.     Mr. Horne has often spoken to them about cleaning and keeping the village clean, but without success.   The utmost they do is to pay a little attention as long as his camp is near their village.    A large market is held twice a week in the heart of the village, and Mr. Horne, going through the village the day after market-day, saw human ordure lying about in the neighbour- hood of the market-place.   He had it removed at once, but there is no doubt that ordi- narily this is left to lie.    And further, the place for burning dead bodies is quite close to the village, so that the smell would be carried into the village if the wind happened to be in that direction.    It is not, then, to be wondered at that cholera should become epidemic in such a village. 3.    My object in bringing this matter prominently to your notice, and through you to Government, is three-fold:- First.-I would propose legislative action whereby a Magistrate, with the sanction of the Commissioner, would compel the adoption of proper sanitary measures in any village, the zemindars of which either neglected or refused to listen to and act on his advice in the matter, and make the zemindars pay the expenses of such sanitary measures. Second.-I think some power should be given to Magistrate to enforce some quarantine rules in those villages in which cholera may become epidemic, so that the spread of the disease to other villages may, as far as possible, be prevented.
(   3   ) Third.-The Bulliah Fair is held within 14 miles of Suhutwar, and the Fair is crowded by people from all the villages of the Sub-Division, as well as by traders and others from a distance. It is impossible to say how long cholera may continue in Suhutwar, but it is a point worth consideration whether, in the event of cholera still being at Suhutwar at the time, it would be possible, and if possible whether it would be advisable, to take any steps to prevent the Fair taking place. I have, &c., (Sd.)       G. B. PASLEY, Magistrate. Cholera Statement of Suhutwar from the 6th of July to the 14th of August, 1869, copied by the Daily Putwarree's Statement. Month and Dates. Name of village. Deaths. Sickness not fatal. Remarks.  6th, Suhutwar, 7 None. On my enquiring as to the out-break of cho- lera at Suhutwar, I am informed that a mar- riage procession consisting of hundreds of in- dividuals had gone down to a place called Sulab- deara, in the Shahabad District, where one Sahib Dhoonia was attacked by cholera, and he returned to Suhutwar on the 4th July, 1869; and on the 6th some seven persons caught the disease, and they died. Since the above date it prevailed throughout the village, but it was diminishing during four or five days, from the 6th to the 10th instant; no one newly contracted the disease in those days. But from the 11th instant it is again much increasing. It appears to be epidemic. The total deaths are 287, as per accompanying statistic. Average morta- lity, 7.1 per diem. The number of daily deaths are obtained from the Putwaree's returns; but some of the inhabitants confirmed the truth of the above statement. No return is kept at the Suhutwar Police Chowkee. It is raging furi- ously, as will be seen from the number of 24 deaths occurred yesterday. Although I tried much yet I failed to find out the more fatal cases there.  7th, Ditto ... 8 "   8th, Ditto ... 0 "   9th, Ditto ... 0 "   10th, Ditto ... 9 "   11th, Ditto ... 0 "   12th, Ditto ... 3 "   13th, Ditto  5 "   14th, Ditto ... 4 "   10th, Ditto ... 6 "   16th, Ditto ... 7 "   17th, Ditto  4 "  July, 1869  18th, Ditto ... 9 "   19th, Ditto ... 5 "   20th, Ditto ... 0 "   21st, Ditto ... 6 "   22nd, Ditto ... 0 "   23rd, Ditto ... 9 "   24th, Ditto ... 10 "   25th, Ditto ... 4 "   26th, Ditto ... 8 "   27th, Ditto ... 8 "   28th, Ditto ... 10 "   29th, Ditto ... 11 "   30th, Ditto ... 9 "   31st, Ditto ... 7 "   1st, Ditto ... 9     2nd, Ditto ... 12     3rd, Ditto ... 7     4th, Ditto ... 4    5th, Ditto ... 9    6th, Ditto ... 9    7th, Ditto ... 7   August, 1869.  8th, Ditto ... 10    9th, Ditto ... 11    10th, Ditto ... 7    11th, Ditto ... 12    12th, Ditto ... 6    13th, Ditto ... 11    14th, Ditto ... 24                    Total  287 None.

?( 4 ) From Secretary to Government, North-Western Provinces, to Commissioner, Benares Division (No. 1479A.).-Dated Nynee Tal, the 6th September, 1869. SIR,-I am directed to acknowledge the recept of your letter, No. 212, dated 18th ultimo, reporting a serious outbreak of cholera in the town of Suhutwar, in the Bulliah Sub-Division of the Ghazeepore District. 2.     In reply, I am to state that His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor  has  heard with regret of this severe outbreak, and the more so   as   it may in   some  respect  be attributed to neglect of the reiterated admonitions of the Local Authorities to attend to the sanitary condition of their village. 3.     The provisions of Section 34 of Act V. of 1861 have   this   day been  made applicable to  the  town  of Suhutwar, and a copy of the notification which has been issued is herewith forwarded for your  information.    It is  thought that the power which will thus be placed in the Magistrate's hands will  enable  him  to enforce  the removal of nuisances injurious to the public health. 4.    I am to add that it is to be hoped that, as the Bulliah Fair draws  near,  the vicinity will become more healthy.    The Magistrate of Ghazeepore, however, will, if necessary, report further on this subject as time advances. 5.    The original enclosure of your letter is returned. I have, &c., R. SIMSON, Secy. to Govt., N.-W. P.

From Magistrate of Ghazeepore, to Commissioner, Benares Division (No. 121).- Dated Ghazeepore, the 24th August, 1869. SIR,-With reference to my letter, No. 117, dated 17th instant, I am glad to inform you that the prevalence of cholera has subsided to a great extent in Suhut- war, Pergunnah Khureed. From the reports which now come to me, it appears that one or two cases of cholera occur daily, but do not terminate fatally as before, and the epidemic has not spread itself beyond Suhutwar. I have, &c., (Sd.)       G. ?. PASLEY, Magistrate. No order. 1                                                       2
