Before undertaking large-scale field trials with these products, it was considered desirable to collect all available information concerning the disease as it occurred in Bengal, and it was necessary to acquire some reliable information concerning such epizootiological aspects as seasonal prevalence, regional distribution, etc. It was also considered pertinent to determine if large-scale annual vaccina- tions were really advisable on technical as well as economic grounds. Records dating back to the inception of the Civil Veterinary Department in Bengal were examined along with relevant data concerning certain selected periods. The results of this study, and of some vaccination work which was undertaken during the year concerned, were reported to the Indian Council of Agricultural Re- search [Mohan, 1946]. In view of the desirability of comparing these findings with those of other Provinces, the information collected is described below. HISTORY A perusal of the old annual reports of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, shows that anthrax was one of the few infectious and contagious diseases of animals which were well recognized to occur in different parts of the Province at the inception of that Department in 1892. At that time, an- thrax was known in India as 'Loodianah disease', but on closer study of the clinical features, the identity of the two diseases soon became clear. In the 1896-97 report, in response to a request from the Director of Land Records 'to draw up brief instructions describing symptoms, etc., of the disease for circulation to all Collectors', Raymond [1897] appends a short clinical description of 'Loodianah disease' and concludes: 'For practical purposes, Anthrax and Loodianah are one and the same disease, as far as our knowledge goes at present'. The tabulated statements, of districts affected with cattle disease outbreaks appended to the 1898-99 report, contain the first anthrax seizure and mortality figures in some districts of Bengal, as the Province is at present constituted [June 1947]. The disease is almost every year reported to have caused varyin g degree of mortality in the different districts ever since. EXTENT OF MORTALITY Speaking on the whole, the annual recorded mortality due to anthrax in Bengal, has been low. Thus, mortality due to this disease in bovines recorded in the annual reports during a period of 32 years [1911-12 to 1942-43] constitutes only about 2.6 per cent (varying from 0.2 per cent to 16.8 per cent) of the total mortality amongst this species of domesticated animals attributed to contagious diseases. There have, however, been certain periods when anthrax caused heavy mortality in the Province, either when it broke out in most districts and caused heavier all-round mortality or when it assumed the form of large-sized epizootics involving considerable areas of one or more districts. Below is given a brief account of mortality caused by the disease in Bengal during the years 1898-1945. Starting from a small total of 40 in five districts in 1898-99, death figures due to anthrax sudden- ly rose to a total of 804 in 18 districts in 1899-1900, gradually coming down to 17 (only one district affected) by 1902-03. In 1903-04, there were only 39 deaths in three districts. In the following year, 473 deaths were recorded from seven districts, 440 of these being from Mymensingh. In 1905- 06, there were only 51 deaths, and no deaths were recorded during the succeeding three years. Then for eight years, mortality varied irregularly between 17 in 1910-11 and 162 in 1912-13, but in 1917-18, it suddenly rose to 1,683 being followed by 2,555 deaths in 1918-19. In 1917-18, 12 districts were * New Veterinary Investigation Officer, United Provinces, Lucknow.

In 1918-19, only five districts were affected and the bulk of the mortality recorded was in 24-Parganas which returned a figure of 2,503 deaths.

4 Some Aspects of Anthrax in Bengal [VOL. XVIII, PART I, There have been deaths among the equines practically every year, but the mortality figures have always been very low. The total mortality due to anthrax among equines during 30 years from 1911-12 to 1942-43 is 87 (or 3.2 per cent) out of a total mortality in them due to contagious diseases of 2,697, and the maximum number of deaths occurring in any year was 15 in 1917-18. This is per- haps largely due to the fact that Bengal is not a horse-raising country; the total equine census of this Province is 77,398 only. In sheep, only four outbreaks have been recorded so far, mostly from Dacca. The mortality caused was two in 1938-39, 32 in 1936-37, 49 in 1932-33, and 20 in 1923-24. In goats, especially from 1936-37 onwards, outbreaks have been reported from some districts, the annual mortality varying between 20 and 154. The total mortality caused by anthrax in goats from 1936-37 to 1941-42 was 377 (or 2 per cent) out of a total mortality of 17,506 from all causes in this species, and about 54 per year on an average. In 1932-33, one death due to anthrax in an elephant was recorded at Jalpaiguri. There are no authentic reports of the disease breaking out in pigs and other susceptible species. Anthrax in man There have been occasions when the disease has spread to human beings. In the 1936 epizootic [Kerr and Balwant Singh, 1936] involving certain districts in East Bengal, 66 human beings (58 males and 8 females) became affected. These people were either directly or indirectly connected with slaughter of infected animals and handling of their hides and flesh. They were mostly hide-merchants, butchers and cultivators and belonged to beef-eating communities. In one of the affected villages (Shayestapur, District Noakhali) a cultivator slaughtered a sick cow which he had purchased the previous day from a neighbouring market, sold, and distributed its meat to other villagers. Thirteen persons who handled this meat contracted the infection and two of them, both women, died. Four cattle and one goat also became affected. The malignant pustules, developing in human beings in these outbreaks generally remained loca- lized and the majority of the affected persons recovered completely in a few weeks to a few months. In eight, however, septicaemia developed and death resulted in three to seven days. The pustules were located on different parts of the body, those most commonly affected being the hands, especially the fingers, and the face. In order of frequency, the upper extremities were involved in 45 per cent of cases, the head and face in 27 per cent, the legs in 20 per cent and the trunk in 8 per cent. In five of the eight fatal cases, the pustules were on head and face, in two on the fingers, and in one on the leg. Age and sex of affected animals There are no records to show at what age the different species of animals acquire infection in largest number. It seems, however, that adult animals about the middle part of their life, say three to six years in the case of cattle, are those most susceptible. Regarding sex, there is absolutely no information. It is possible to make a general statement that so far no particular age, sex, breed and colour susceptibility to the disease has been observed. CLINICAL ASPECTS In this paper, it is not proposed to deal at length with clinical symptoms and post-mortem fea- tures. Reference was made to the symptoms described by Raymond (loc. cit.) for 'Loodianah disease' as well as those briefly noted by Kerr and Balwant Singh (loc. cit.). Some information was also collected from certain officers of the Department, who claimed first-hand clinical experience of the disease in Bengal. All these accounts were, in general, found to correspond fairly with the standard text book descriptions of the disease and the variety of symptoms commonly observed in other parts of the world. It may, however, be noted that in goats, the disease has generally been seen to run a peracute course, proving fatal in almost all cases. Deaths have been noted to occur in a few hours and, in some cases, even in a few minutes after the onset of symptoms.
MARCH 1948] RAM NARAIN MOHAN AND SYED MAHMUD ALI 5 DIAGNOSIS Since some years ago, it has been made the. routine practice for the district staff to submit for microscopical examination blood-films from cases suspected of anthrax. Very often, however, neither any affected animals nor any carcases are available at the time the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon visits the affected village, so that, not all outbreaks reported as anthrax are microscopically confirmed. Examination of some 200 outbreaks which occurred during the latter part of the period after 1940 showed that only about 60 per cent of these were confirmed. In most parts of Bengal, the cattle owners are not so familiar with anthrax as they have become with diseases like rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease, black-quarter and haemorrhagic septicaemia. Most of them fail to recognize anthrax, especially at the beginning of an outbreak, when even compe- tent technical officers, and especially those who have had no previous experience of the disease, may often find it difficult to diagnose correctly from clinical signs alone. It seems probable that anthrax is often mistaken for other diseases such as haemorrhagic septicaemia, poisoning, snake bite, etc. Added to these difficulties is the fact that the disease usually occurs sporadically in well-separated localities. Many of these points are repeatedly stressed in the annual reports of the Department and, in view of this, a hundred per cent reliance cannot be placed on the recorded figures. Seasonal prevalence In the war against any disease, knowledge of its natural behaviour is always helpful. An im- portant aspect of this is the season to season variation in its incidence. Moreover, when dealing with a vaccine, the immunity conferred by which is not expected to last for more than a few months, it becomes essential to determine at what time of the year the prophylactic inoculations should be undertaken so that revaccination may not become necessary until the following year. For securing information about the seasonal prevalence of anthrax in Bengal, records giving figures of outbreaks in different months in different districts of the Province during the ten year period from 1937 to 1946 were examined. They were also analysed statistically. These figures (Tables I and II) have shown that the outbreak incidence curve in Bengal is at a low point in January. It shows a tendency to rise in February and March, followed by a somewhat sudden jump to very near the peak in April. The peak is reached during May and June, but during July and August the curve declines, reaching its almost lowest point of the year in September. Again, in October and November, there is an upward tendency, before the final decline to the lowest point of the year in December. Among the different districts, there seems to be no appreciable and signi- ficant difference in the seasonal behaviour of these outbreaks, beyond some minor irregular varia- tions.

8 Some Aspects of Anthrax in Bengal [VOL. XVIII, PART I, It may be concluded from this that while anthrax may break out in any part of Bengal at any time of the year, the majority of the outbreaks occur during the summer months. Thus, of the 998 outbreaks which occurred during 1937-1946 more than 65 per cent were during the four months of April, May, June and July. Analysis of the seizure and mortality figures for this period has also revealed a very much higher incidence of the disease in these four months than in the other months. It is generally believed that in warm countries the maximum incidence of anthrax is in the months of June, July, August and September [Topley and Wilson, 1936]. The present study, however, shows that the period of maximum incidence in Bengal slightly precedes this, it being the summer and the first half of the rainy season. On comparing the incidence curve of anthrax outbreaks in Bengal with the prevailing weather conditions the two factors which appear to mainly coincide with this incidence are the atmospheric temperature and the rainfall, probably as they affect the soil and other environmental conditions. Thus, in December and January (Tables I and II), when the weather is cool and dry and the rainfall is at its minimum, the incidence of anthrax outbreaks is very low. In February and March, when both maximum and minimum temperatures rise, rainfall increases a little (though the humidity is still low), the incidence, though still rather low, shows a tendency to increase. In April, when the temperature rises to very near the most optimum temperature for vegetation and multiplication of B. anthracis, rainfall increases a little more, and the humidity, though still low, shows a tendency to rise, the incidence increases considerably. In May, when the mean temperature is about the same as in April, the rainfall increases considerably and the humidity also rises, the incidence is at its highest. In June, when the maximum temperature comes down and the minimum temperature rises, both by a couple of degrees, the rainfall is heavy and the humidity high, the incidence is almost as high as in May. In July, when the temperature is still favourable, humidity very high and the rainfall heavy, the incidence is moderately high but on the decline. In August, when the temperature is almost the same as in July, humidity a little higher still and the rainfall continues to be heavy, the incidence decreases considerably. In September, when the temperature and humidity remain about the same as in July and August, and the rainfall decreases a little, the incidence is almost at its lowest point in the year. In October and November, when the temperature, though gradually coming down, is still favourable, humidity about the same as in June, cloudiness and rainfall further decreased and the soil comparatively less soaked with water than before, there is a small increase in the incidence before the final decrease in December. To sum up, the incidence of anthrax outbreaks in Bengal seems primarily to vary with the at- mospheric temperature, being low in winter months, gradually rising with the approach of summer and reaching the peak when the mean temperature approaches the most optimum temperature for the growth and multiplication of B. anthracis. Moderately high humidity and moderately heavy rainfall seem to favour high incidence, very heavy rainfall and very high humidity keeping it low. The great decrease in the incidence from July to September may be due chiefly to a cumulative effect of the heavy and continued monsoon showers which can be expected to wash out most of the existing soil contamination, leach out the available food elements, dilute the remaining contamination, and by raising the atmospheric humidity and the moisture content and acidity of the soil, interfere with aerobiosis and multiplication of the organisms. The finding, that anthrax in Bengal shows a well-defined seasonal incidence can be profitably utilized in case it is decided to adopt prophylactic vaccination in any locality. Such operations can be so timed that the most active period of the immunity conferred covers the major anthrax season. Thus, the best time to undertake prophylactic vaccination against the disease in Bengal, if done only once a year, would be the period soon after the beginning of February. As it is advised to use the vaccine as fresh as possible, its manufacture and stocking in bulk may also be adjusted according to the seasonal prevalence of the disease.
MARCH 1948] RAM NARAIN MOHAN AND SYED MAHMUD ALI 9 YEAR TO YEAR VARIATION IN MORTALITY The extent of annual mortality due to anthrax as recorded in the reports of the Department from 1897-98 to 1944-45 has been briefly summarized elsewhere. It is seen that the annual figures of these 48 years show a very great variation, viz., from nil to a maximum of 2,555, working to an average of under 450 deaths per year. This variation remains almost as patent when it is considered in relation to total mortality in livestock and even after allowing for fluctuations due to seasons and random causes. The extent of variation seems too great and irregular to be satisfactorily explained as due to direct influence of any climatic or other environmental factors. The three periods which stand out more or less prominently associated with heavy mortality are considered below. (i) The year 1899-1900 recorded 804 deaths due to anthrax against 40 in the preceding and 339 in the succeeding years, and the total mortality in the three-year period from 1899- 1900 to 1901-02 was 1,436. (ii) The heaviest annual mortality ever experienced was recorded during 1917-1919 (4,238 deaths in two years). (iii) An extended period of eight years from 1934-35 to 1941-42 recorded an average annual mortality of 1,310 in bovines and about 50 in other animals. The periods noted above do not bear any relationship with each other and it is difficult to imagine that the heavy mortality experienced in them was primarily related to any natural factors. It seems likely that the occurrence of large epizootics and consequent heavy mortality are chiefly due to spread of infection by means which are well appreciated by animal epizootiologists. The fact that these periods have occurred at intervals of about 18 years may not be of any significance. Regional distribution Some idea of the regional distribution of anthrax in Bengal can be gained by considering (i) the number of years during which anthrax outbreaks have occurred in the different districts, (ii) the mortality figures of different districts, and (iii) the number of outbreaks occurring in different districts during 1937-1946. The past years have shown wide difference in these respects. Generally speaking, the extent to which a particular district has been affected with anthrax seems to have been largely governed by its area and livestock population. Nevertheless, even after allowing for such factors, certain districts do seem to have been affected somewhat more than the others. Dacca stands out as the most heavily affected district. Moreover, it is in this district that the disease has often spread to goats and also to human beings. The other districts in which the incidence has been comparatively high in the past few years are Midnapore and Murshidabad in West Bengal, and Tippera, Noakhali and Mymensingh, flanking the banks of the Brahmaputra in East Bengal. In the Gangetic delta in south Bengal, the districts of Khulna and Bakarganj have occasionally experienced heavy mortality10 Some Aspects of Anthrax in Bengal [VOL.

It is not desired to draw any conclusions from the small experience with these two herds. It tends to show, however, that the new Indian Veterinary Research Institute spore vaccine is perfectly safe for use in cattle and buffaloes in that, it does not give rise to much systemic disturbance or local swelling, and that the immunity following vaccination may not be expected to last for more than five months or so. INADVISABILITY OF LARGE-SCALE ANNUAL VACCINATION (a) Economic considerations. It has already been stated that the average recorded mortality due to anthrax amounts to only about 2.6 per cent of the total mortality due to contagious disease in bovines. While it is neither possible nor advisable to vaccinate every year the entire stock of the Province (over 30 millions), even in smaller areas such vaccinations are economically unjustified. Below are examined some data for two small Thana areas in Jhargram Sub-division of Midnapore district, localities which in the recent past have been affected with anthrax comparatively more frequently: MARCH 1948] RAM NARAIN MOHAN AND SYED MAHMUD ALI 15 6. There have been certain periods, of no obvious relationship, when epizootics of larger size were experienced. 7. The percentage of mortality recorded has varied annually from about 70 to about 85. 8. The clinical features have shown no substantial departure from the classical symptoms. 9. The disease has shown a definite seasonal prevalence in that roughly two-thirds of all outbreaks have occurred during the period April to July, i.e., in the summer and the first half of the rainy seasons. 10. The number of outbreaks occurring in different districts has generally been largely propor- tionate to their area and cattle population. 11. Certain districts, especially those in the combined Ganges-Brahmaputra deltaic area, have experienced comparatively heavy mortality. 12. Some experience with anti-anthrax serum inoculation and vaccination, including the new Indian Veterinary Research Institute spore vaccine, is described and the technical and economic aspects of such prophylactic measures are considered. 13. The new Indian Veterinary Research Institute spore vaccine has been found safe for use in all types of cattle and it probably confers immunity for about five months. 14. In view of the disease occurring in almost all parts of Bengal and in the absence of known endemic centres, it is considered that prompt diagnosis and suitable hygienic measures, combined with judicious vaccination, are likely to effect better control than large scale annual vaccinations, which are also uneconomical. 15. For valuable stock, however, prophylactic vaccination is recommended. REFERENCES Balwant Singh (1937). An. Rep. Vet. Invest. Officer, Bengal, for 1936-37 Kerr, P. J. and Balwant Singh (1936).

OBSERVATIONS ON USE OF ANTHRAX SPORE VACCINE IN MADRAS By G. R. VISWANATHAN, M. RAMAKRISHNA PILLAI and S. VENKATARAMA AYYAR, Veterinary Investiga- tion Service, Madras (Received for publication on 29 July 1946) THE use of anthrax spore vaccine in Madras was introduced in 1939. The results have been referred to in the reports of the Disease Investigation Officer of Madras [Viswanathan, 1937-45] and in the report of the Civil Veterinary Department of Madras for the year 1933-34. This article summarises some of the results observed. Apart from vaccination, it is recognized that in order to achieve success in checking the disease, other measures required are, an early and correct diagnosis, as well as the proper disposal of carcases and proper cleaning of contaminated areas. While in most cases anthrax can be readily diagnozed by microscopical examination of blood smears taken immediately after death, the clinical symptoms and history are very helpful in making a tentative diagnosis. As to the use of anthrax serum for control, serum sometimes appears to be efficient in bovines and also in sheep in fresh centres of infection. In our hands, however, it has not proved effective in controlling outbreaks of 'subacute anthrax' in bovines. that is, outbreaks which tend to run a prolonged course. Nor has the serum been found helpful with sheep and goats, except in enzootic areas. SPORE VACCINE IN PRACTICE The vaccine used was obtained from Mukteswar during 1939 to 1941 and from 1942 to date. During 1941-42 a thousand doses of vaccine prepared in Burma were used. The vaccine was given in 1.0 c.c. dose subcutaneously in the neck in bovines, sheep and goats; in elephants the injection was given into the subcutaneous tissue behind the elbow and was followed 20 days later by a second dose of 3.0 c.c. The vaccine has good keeping quality and under favourable storage conditions remains unchanged for some time, so that no difficulty was experienced in its transport and distribu- tion in the field. Unless assured as to the safety of the vaccine, small-scale preliminary tests were conducted on the particular species to be vaccinated. Thus in 1941-42 the Burma vaccine was tried during an outbreak of anthrax on six bovines, of which, four bullocks were given at the same time anthrax serum in dose of 20 c.c. There were no reactions. On another occasion spore vaccine from Mukteswar was used together with anthrax serum on five goats and 74 lambs. Serum was used for all the animals in dose of 20-40 c.c. the goats were given 1.0 c.c. of the vaccine and the sheep 0.5 c.c. The goats died of anthrax while the sheep were unaffected, showing that the vaccine was too severe for goats, at least in the dose given. This is in accord with the knowledge that it is more difficult to produce a suitable vaccine for goats than for sheep, though with the latter species also no small care has to be taken. As a result of the experiment just referred to, a milder vaccine and one suitable for goats as well as sheep is now supplied from Mukteswar. In company with Mr V. R. Rajagopalan, a safety test of spore vaccine was made on an elephant belonging to the Forest Department. In this case the vaccine was found to be safe when given in dosage of 1.0 c.c. followed 20 days later by 3.0 c.c. In Table 1 are shown the species and number of animals treated with the spore vaccine, both at the time of outbreaks and in localities where no outbreak was prevailing. No animals could be left as unvaccinated controls in the particular herds or flocks being treated, though in the same villages some herds or flocks remain unvaccinated. In the case of sheep and goats some animals in free areas adjacent to the enzootic areas were first vaccinated as a trial. The results were encouraging in the sense that anthrax failed to appear in areas where anthrax carcases had been carelessly disposed of and where contamination was likely to have occurred. The elephants mostly belonged to the Forest Department and a few to private owners. 17 O

In cattle and buffaloes the reactions were negligible and consisted in a small proportion of cases of slight local swelling, slight fever and dullness. All these symptoms were transient. In elephants, only slight local swelling was seen. In sheep and goats, as noted by others e.g. Chadda [1939] symptoms due to the local irritant effect of the strong glycerol diluent were seen. Shortly after the injection, the animals started running round, jumping and bleating. Some lay down and rubbed their heads on the ground. Such symptoms caused alarm to the ryots but the signs of acute local irrita- tion could be easily avoided by diluting the vaccine with two parts of normal saline solution prior to injection. With the first batch of vaccine from Mukteswar the reaction was very severe and 11.5 per cent of the injected animals (2,600 sheep and 88 goats) died, and some pregnant ewes aborted. With the milder batches subsequently supplied the reactions consisted only of slight local swelling and fever, though they were rather more severe in goats, a negligible percentage (below 1.0 per cent) died. DURATION OF IMMUNITY Mitchell [1930 ] in Burma states that from his experience of the immunization of animals against anthrax, the immunity lasts for about 12 to 16 months. It was found that sheep and goats left under natural conditions are unable to withstand three months later an inoculation of 1000 MLD of virulent anthrax culture. In this connection, 29 sheep and 25 goats, with six sheep to six goats as controls, were tested. That there is some residual immunity however is shown by the fact that after the test dose, the course of the disease in vaccinated animals is of two or three days, whereas in unvaccinated ones death occurs earlier. Also, after experimental inoculation, the mortality ratio as between vaccinated and non-vaccinated is 1:7.3, the numbers used being seven of the former and 51 of the latter. Since in practice sheep and goats do not contract anthrax within eight months after vaccination it would seem that they have a serviceable immunity at least for this period. In some of the enzootic areas annual vaccination of sheep and goats has completely stopped the disease. The vaccine indeed has become popular in the province. Ryots now understand the value of vaccina- tion in minimising the losses from anthrax, whereas formerly they were often unwilling to permit vaccination since deaths from anthrax are usually few, at least at the beginning of outbreaks. Finally, a test with 1000 MLD of virulent culture applied by Mr Rajagopalan in Madras to an elephant 24 days after its second vaccination produced no reaction. SUMMARY Results obtained in Madras from the use of anthrax spore vaccine for cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats and elephants are briefly described. Over twenty-two thousand sheep and goats and 120 elephants have been vaccinated during this work. The first vaccines tried were too virulent for

The present vaccines, which are safe for these susceptible species, have been used as a preventive in areas hitherto free from anthrax and in enzootic areas, both in the presence and absence of outbreaks. Under these conditions outbreaks in cattle have been controlled and when used annually, vaccination has prevented the appearance of the disease in sheep and goats in areas where previously there was heavy mortality. There is reason to suppose that the period of effective immunity is not less than eight months. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Thanks are due to Messrs P. T. Saunders and T. J.

SREENIVASAN, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on 19 September 1947) FOR a number of years reports have occasionally been received at this Institute of accidents following the use in cattle of immune sera or vaccines. From the description received it is quite obvious that these accidents are anaphylactic in nature. Within a few minutes to several hours after injection of the product, any of the following symptoms may attract notice: generalized urticaria with itching, oedema of the head and perineal region, restlessness, excitement, tenderness at the site of injection, yawning, tremor, muscular weakness, dyspnoea, coughing. Deaths have occasionally been reported. A few references have been found to the occurrence of anaphylaxis in cattle. Holmes [1913] refers to fatalities occurring in cattle after massive repeated injections of rinderpest blood and peritoneal washings. Since the material was homologous in kind and since symptoms were not immediate, with death as long as 2 to 11 days later, it is doubtful whether the illness so induced was true anaphylaxis. Jacob [1940] states that symptoms are often alarming but disappear within a few hours and death is rare. Reichel [1939] quotes Hoskins to the effect that the period of incubation may be from 1 to 4 weeks. In some instances shock develops after what is alleged to be a first injection and even with homologous proteins. Such cases are perhaps to be explained by a specially high natural suscepti- bility, though it is not known in what proportion such cases occur. Even heated serum, homologous or heterologous, is capable of producing anaphylaxis. A possible but not very practical test for determining the sensitiveness of animals which are to get serum consists in an opthalmic test, in which a few drops of the serum diluted at 1:10 are placed on the conjunctiva. An intradermal test can be similarly employed. In India, the occurrence of anaphylaxis or serum sickness in cattle is not widely known; no references for example have been found in the annual reports of the Disease Investigation Officers. On the other hand, colleagues with whom the matter has been discussed are aware of its existence. As concrete examples of anaphylaxis the following are worth mentioning. In the filed records of this Institute we find that in 1927 at the Hosur farm (Madras) 40 young cattle of Sindhi cross-bred, Ongole and Kangayam breeds were injected with anthrax serum and of these 18, aged 13-32 months, showed severe anaphylactic shock and one died. These animals had previously been given black- quarter aggressin and serum. In 1929 at the same farm 326 cattle were given rinderpest serum in the course of serum-simultaneous immunization, and as a result 51 showed symptoms of serum sickness and one died. The latter was a heifer of Ongole breed, aged three years. It developed symptoms within 10 minutes of being injected, viz. swellings in various parts of the body, distressed breathing and sub-normal temperature. On post-mortem examination haemorrhagic lesions were found in the submucous coats of the abomasum and intestine. Even allowing for the facts that only a proportion of such accidents as those described are reported and that severe serum sickness must be comparatively rare cases, when they do occur, are naturally disturbing to field workers and deserve investigation. Some investigations indeed were carried on hill-bulls at this Institute by the late Mr Hugh Cooper and myself in 1930. These seemed to indicate that of biological products ordinarily used blackquarter agreessin was the one most liable to be followed by anaphylaxis, provided the animal had previously received injections of immune sera. There were no deaths. A fresh series of experiments was started at Mukteswar in 1944 in order to obtain further informa- tion on the liability of the local cattle to suffer anaphylaxis after being injected with various doses of immune serum at various times. Some work with blackquarter vaccine was also done. Finally some observations were made on methods of preventing attacks and the duration of the refractory state which immediately follows the reaction to an injected antigen. 21 D
22 Anaphylaxis or Serum Sickness in Cattle [VOL. XVIII, PART 1, EXPERIMENTAL Kumauni hill-bulls were used as experimental animals, except in a few cases where cross-bred (Ayrshire-Sahiwal or Sindhi) calves were used. The products used were immune sera prepared against anthrax, blackquarter, bovine pasteurellosis and rinderpest. Since most, if not all of these products for veterinary use in India are prepared in buffaloes and since it was most likely that the trouble arose from the use of heterologous serum, some use was also made of normal buffalo serum. A few tests were also done with homologous serum. At the present time, aggressin is no longer manufactured in the Institute for prevention of blackquarter. Use was therefore made of the formalinized culture vaccine that is now issued; this is prepared in Noguchi medium in which is incorporated buffalo muscle extract and rabbit kidney. The products were injected at intervals varying from 7 to 60 days, while a few regular reactors were tested after 13 months. Incidence of anaphylaxis, symptoms During the whole course of this work 260 hill-bulls and 12 cross-bred calves have been treated subcutaneously with various biological products, mostly immune serum made from buffaloes. It is highly improbable that these animals had been given any form of serum treatment previously. Of these 62 (22.8 per cent) showed symptoms of serum sickness and one animal died. Further details of this work are given below and the data are summarized in Table I. The incidence of reaction in the various groups was variable, e.g. in one batch of 124 bulls about 20.0 per cent reacted, in another group of 100 bulls 5.0 per cent reacted. The 62 cases could be divided into three groups according to their severity as slight, mild and severe reactors. Thus in 31 (11.4 per cent) reactions were slight, in 14 (5.1 per cent) they were mild, and in 17 (6.3 per cent) they were severe. The symptoms produced varied considerably, from a few urticarial eruptions to severe shock. Many of the reactions would have been overlooked had not a thorough examination been made. In mild cases the only changes were urticarial swellings round the anus and on the perineum, slight swelling of the anus, and watery discharge from the eyes. Severe cases are indicated by pronounced oedematous swelling of the anus, perineum scrotum and sheath, of the head and neck or of the ears. There may also be severe urticarial eruptions over the body, marked swelling at the site of inoculation, restlessness, rapid and noisy dyspnoeic breathing, passage of dull-looking faeces which may be soft and blood-tinged. The animal does not feed and lies down. There is discharge from the eyes and nose, profuse salivation and sometimes muscular twitchings. The body temperature falls to 99°F. Tympanites is liable to appear and may cause death unless relieved. The appearance of urine is unchanged. The symptoms may develop as early as five minutes after subcutaneous inoculation and in many cases within 20 to 60 minutes. In mild cases the symptoms disappeared within 2-3 hours and in severe cases within 24 hours. One bull, which died, developed acute tympanites before death. Noticeable changes were widespread cutaneous haemorrhages, oedema of the larynx, pharynx and base of the tongue with yellowish gelatinous exudate. There was some endocardial haemorrhage on the left ventricle, and congestion of various organs, e.g. the lungs. Results obtained with repeated injections of various biological products The results obtained with 19 hill-bulls and five cross-bred calves, which reacted at least once following the injections, are summarized in Table II. It will be seen that two subcutaneous injections of blackquarter serum at 20 or 40 days interval produced no symptoms. This in fact was the case with all the 62 reactors whatever the antigen. Their state of hypersensitiveness however is shown by the shock which follows the subcutaneous injection of rinderpest serum or blackquarter vaccine. Once the animals are sensitized in this way they are liable to be shocked by other immune sera, dosage being unimportant within the limits used, and the fact that they equally respond to serum from uninoculated buffaloes strongly suggests that it is the foreign serum protein which is responsible for the shock. At the same time serum from hill-bulls, i.e. homologous serum, is without effect. In these experiments the duration of the sensitive state was for at least 397 days.

XVIII, PART 1, TABLE IIMARCH 1948.] M. K. SREENIVASAN 25 Experiments on prevention of shock Three methods have been proposed : (1) The use of immune serum prepared from the same species of animal, (2 Dividing the amount of antigen into fractions, and giving one or more small doses and following up with the remainder of the amount after an hour or so. What may be called a modification of this method and (3) is to give the desensitizing dose of serum in diluted form, i.e. injection of reagents having an anti-histamine effect. As to (1), the chief reason why buffalo serum is used in the immunization of cattle is apparently because, with the defibrinated or exalated blood of buffaloes, the red cells quickly sediment rendering the use of a centrifuge unnecessary. This is a very important consideration in serum institutes where large quantities of product have to be manufactured. The use of Bos indicus instead of Bos bubalis for serum production would introduce great difficulties in practice. As to (2), the method has been favourably reported upon and if found to be efficacious, should solve the problem. Thus Jacob [ 1940 ] has obtained useful results in this way. As to (3), a number of products have been tried and research in this field is continuing more particularly as regards prevention of atopic disorders such as asthma and hay fever. Thus, Dragstedt, Mills and Meed [1937] found that acute shock in sensitise dogs could be prevented by extract of adrenal cortex. Holmes [ 1913 ] and Reichel [1939] state that the simultaneous injection of a small dose of adrenalin, say 1.0 c.c. 1 : 1,000, will reduce the shock and the reagent may be mixed with the serum. Wolfram and Zwemer [ 1935 ] found cortin to be successful in sensitized guinea pigs. In course of this work chief attention was paid to the second method, the principle of which is to desensitize the animal. Thus in December 1944, 124 hill-bulls were given 25 c.c. blackquarter serum followed 40 days later by a second similar dose. As expected, there were no reactions. Forty days later, the animals were divided into three groups : group I of 42 animals was given 25 c.c. blackquarter serum as a single dose and 10 reacted ; group II of 41 animals was given 25 c.c. healthy buffalo serum as a single dose an even reacted ; in group III of 41 animals the dose of 25 c.c. blackquarter serum was divided: 14 animals were given 1.0 c.c. serum, 14 animals were given 2.0 c.c. serum and the remainder were given 5.0 c.c. serum, one hour later the remainder of the serum dose was injected. In this third group, nine animals reacted viz., two which had been started with the 1.0 c.c. dose, six which had been started with the 2.0 c.c. dose and one which had first been given the 5.0 c.c. dose. These 26 reactors and four non-reacting hill-bulls were then used for further experiments of the same kind. These animals were divided into two groups of 13 reactor and two non-reactors. After about 40 days, rest, group I was given 25 c.c. blackquarter serum in one dose and nine reacted (including one of the ' non-reacting ' hill-bulls); in group II the dose of 25 c.c. blackquarter serum was divided into two parts, the first portion of 5.0 c.c. being followed an hour later by 20 c.c. In group II, eight animals reacted, viz., one severely after the 5 c.c. fraction and the rest after the remaining 20 c.c. fraction. The experiment was continued with the 17 hill-bulls now left as reactors. These animals were divided into three groups of five, 6 and six bulls and tested 45 days later with blackquarter serum. The five animals in group I were given 25 c.c. serum as a single dose and all reacted. The animals of group 2 were given 5 c.c. serum followed two hours later by 20 c.c.; of these six animals, three reacted severely after the 5 c.c. fraction and one died, one reacted slightly after the 20 c.c. fraction, and two did not react. The animals of group III were given 1.0 c.c., 1.5 c.c. and 2.5 c.c. serum at two hourly intervals, followed two hours later by the 20 c.c. fraction; of these six animals, one reacted after the 1.5 c.c. fraction, one after the 2.5 c.c. fraction, two reacted after the final 20 c.c. fraction, and two did not react. DISCUSSION This work has again demonstrated that injections of a foreign antigen set up in cattle a state of hypersensitiveness, revealed by a definite train of symptoms of varying severity on reapplication of the antigen. Cattle vary considerably in their powers of response to the shocking agent, differing in this respect from guinea pigs and rabbits, on which most of the experimental work has hitherto been done. It has been shown that in the small hill cattle the sensitive state is not readily induced E
26 Anaphylaxis or Serum Sickness in Cattle [VOL. XVIII, PART I, and that more than one injection of the antigen at a suitable interval is required. How plains cattle compare in this respect cannot be said. It has also been shown that under the conditions of the experiments in hill cattle only about 20 per cent of the animals are sensitized sufficiently to respond visibly to a shock dose of antigen and that in only about 6 per cent are the symptoms of shock really severe. Under these circumstances it is doubtful whether in practice any special precautions aimed at preventing serum shock are likely to become popular. Nevertheless, the facts are worthy of note by field workers and it may be pointed out that biological products such as serum and vaccine should not be used on the same animals indiscriminately. Whether buffalo serum is more likely to produce shock than sera from other large animals or whether the incidence of anaphylaxis tends to be related to any particular season we do not know. The facts remain that buffalo serum excited shock in the present experiments and that most of the immune sera used for animals in India are prepared in buffaloes. SUMMARY 1. An anaphylactic state can be induced in cattle by subcutaneous injections of immune sera prepared in buffaloes and by injections of blackquarter vaccine consisting of formalinized Noguchi medium culture. The symptoms of anaphylactic shock in cattle are described. About 20.0 per cent of hill cattle react with visible symptoms, in about 6.0 per cent the illness is severe, but less than 1.0 per cent die. 2. Not less than two sensitizing injections are required to produce a state in which visible symptoms will be elicited by further dosage of antigen. For a week or two after a shocking dose the animals are desensitized, while the sensitive state has been found to endure for upwards of a year. 3. Attempts at prevention by giving the shocking dose in small fractions at first, followed within an hour or so by the remainder were unsuccessful. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I am obliged to Dr F. C.

CUTANEOUS ERUPTIONS IN RINDERPEST By * RAM NARAIN MOHAN, Veterinary Investigation Officer, West Bengal (Received for publication on 19 September 1947) THE development of some form of eruption on the skin of cattle during the course of rinderpest has been noted by many observers. The phenomenon seems to have been recognized in India since time immemorial and, as in most other countries, the popular names given to rinderpest have usually been the same as for human pox. In Bengal particularly, it has received some attention in recent years, notably by MacGregor [1944] who, in collaboration with another officer [Mr M. B. Menon], made some preliminary observations and tests. The desirability of making further observa- tions and critical tests to establish the association of the exanthema with rinderpest led to the problem becoming a part of the author's programme of work during 1943-1945. The work done and the information collected are described in the author's reports [Mohan, 1944, 1945] and are partly included in MacGregor's paper. In order to stimulate more interest in this aspect of rinderpest, a summary of these observations is given in this paper along with a résumé of relevant literature. LITERATURE The cutaneous eruptions of rinderpest have been observed in almost all the European countries and in many parts of Africa. It is stated by Curasson [1921, 1932] that the cutaneous form of rinder- pest had attracted the attention of the authors of the eighteenth century and that the relationship between the exanthema and the infection had been recognized as early as 1712 by Ramazzini. In those days, rinderpest is reported to have been classed among the eruptive fevers, as it tended to simulate serious forms of vaccinia [peste varioleuse de Vicq-d'Azyr] and, according to Gerlach [1873], Ramazzini went so far as to designate rinderpest as ' pockenseuche', i.e.,'pock disease '. The develop- ment of the eruptions as a characteristic feature of rinderpest was recognized by later writers also, but once the specific relationship was established no further importance was attached to them, so that the subject was gradually forgotten and was mentioned only exceptionally. The eruptions were repeatedly noted during the great wars of the nineteenth century and were described by Gerlach (loc. cit.), Peuch [1892], Nocard and Leclainche [1903], and other European writers. Gerlach's notes were based on observations made chiefly in Holland and Germany, but also in Hungary and England. Gärtner [1920] found them to be a common feature in East Africa. Hutyra and Marek [1916] described them from Roumania and noted their frequent occurrence in cattle of the steppes of Russia, where considerable importance has been attached to the phenomenon. Curasson (loc. cit.) and his colleagues working in West Africa during the epizootics of 1916-1919 found the eruptions a more or less constant feature in Sudan and other parts. Croveri [1921] found them very frequent in Italian Somaliland, Carlier [1920] in Belgian Congo, and Pecaud [1924] in Chad. Malfrey [1927] and Schein [cited by Curasson, 1932] have discussed the phenomenon and have sought explanation in climatic influences. Angeloff [1918], on the other hand, noted the eruptions in only two cases out of several hundred during the 1912-13 Balkan War, and Malfrey [cited by Curasson] observed them in only exceptional cases in Nigeria during the 1916-1919 epizootics. Vrijburgh [cited by Hutyra, Marek and Manninger, 1938] and Melanidi and Stylianopoulo [1927] never observed any cutaneous lesions in West Indies and Greece, respectively. In India, MacGregor (loc. cit.) seems to have been the only modern writer to draw attention to the appearance of these eruptions. The Indian Cattle Plague Commission's report [1871] contains several interesting references to the subject. A few selected extracts are given below. Page 59. (A letter from Hiram Farrell, Veterinary Surgeon, His Majesty's Bengal Army, to Baboo Hem Chander Kerr, Deputy Magistrate, Diamond Harbour, District 24-Parganas, Bengal.) '...........body is covered with small vesicles resembling pimples (which later) become ulcerated, dry and covered with scabs..........I have invariably found that the greater the amount of erup- tion the more favourable was the case'. * New Veterinary Investigation Officer, United Provinces, Lucknow. 27 F
28 Cutaneous Eruptions in Rinderpest [VOL. XVIII, PART I, Page 75. (Evidence of T. L. Taylor, Superintendent, Municipal Gaokhana, Calcutta). ' ...... eruption in some cases occurring generally on the loins, fore shoulders, but not on the belly. The eruption is dry, and in passing the hand over the skin it feels like hard pimples.

(Evidence of Brojo Kishore Ghose, 25, a resident of Korojolee near Diamond Harbour, District 24-Parganas.) Generally speaking, in sporadic form, or in those cases occurring at a time when the disease has not assumed an epizootic form, very often the cattle affected do not entirely lose their appetite and do not, as a rule, purge, but in such cases eruptions on the skin are almost sure to make their appearance. The animal generally gets well. When purging takes place and there is no eruption it is nearly always fatal. Page 97. (Information given by three residents of Dowlat Dyar, District Nadia, Bengal.) ........in some cases an eruption appears on or about the seventh day (one or two days after diarrhoea), at first in the form of spots, and the skin peals off.

On the fifth day (of the fever) the eruption appears about the udder, sometimes only a few pustules, at other times, they are numerous and confluent ; but the result does not seem much dependent on the eruption. Whether the pustules are numerous or rare, the disease is almost equally fatal........ When the hair is rubbed off after the pustules have appeared on the udder, the skin is found covered with sores ; many die before the eruption makes its appearance. Page 196. (Extracts from records of Medical Department, Lohardugga District, Chhota Nagpur. A letter from W. Dunbar, Assistant Surgeon, Dorunda, dated March 1836.).........towards the close of the disease in such cases (i.e., which recover) an eruption breaks out over the skin, of a reddish dusky colour, each spot or pustule being about the size of a split pea. The eruption, as the animal gets well, generally disappears. Similar evidence was available concerning the Central Provinces, Sind and South India (Canara). FREQUENCY OF APPEARANCE From the foregoing résumé of literature it will be seen that while some observers found the erup- tions to be rare or uncommon, there are many others, notably Curasson, who regard them as a more or less constant feature of the disease appearing almost as commonly as other symptoms like mouth lesions and diarrhoea. Gärtner (loc. cit.) observed generalized exanthema in 60 to 80 per cent of affected animals. From the fact that skin eruptions are seldom reported from most parts of India, where epizootics of different dimensions break out practically every year, the experience of this country would place the frequency as very low indeed. At any rate, the eruptions, if they develop, do not appear generally to do so in sufficient numbers and severity to attract attention. In Bengal, on the other hand, they seem to have been observed comparatively frequently, though here again there is some difference of opinion with regard to their frequency. The experience gained in the past few years shows that they are not a common feature, as most of the animals examined during a number of outbreaks of rinderpest failed to show any eruptions. During the period 1941-1945, the eruptions were noticed in nearly twenty outbreaks, out of several hundreds, in different parts of the Province. It must, however, be recognized that, on account of their minute size in the earlier stages and the more or less hairy coat of cattle, the eruptions are liable to be missed in most cases, unless specially looked for particularly when they appear in small numbers only. Moreover, a large proportion of the animals affected with rinderpest in India die before any skin eruptions are detected fully. DESCRIPTION AND COURSE OF THE ERUPTIONS Among the western writers, the eruptions have been well described by both Gerlach and Curasson. As these descriptions are in German and French and not available to most field workers in India, some relevant translated extracts are given below.
MARCH 1948] RAM NARAIN MOHAN 29 Gerlach (1873). The skin is affected principally in the same way as the mucous membrane, but not so constantly, and generally in a few places only. If the lesions are few in number they are liable to be missed. It is always the fine, especially the unpigmented, skin on which the exanthema appears, the favourite sites being the udder, especially the base of the teats, and the scrotum. Less frequently, it may be seen on the nasal alae and vulvar labiae, perineum, inside of the thighs, on the head and neck ; very seldom, it gets generalized. As with lesions on the mucosa, the course of the skin eruptions varies with the severity of the initial lesion. The mildest lesions lead to rich des- quamation and yellowish brown crusts cover the areas. The next higher grade shows itself by hyper- aemia, diffuse erysipelatous reddening, much peeling off, transudation, moistening and greasing of the affected spots, and finally formation of thin scabs. The severest lesions consist of intense reddening, destruction of epidermis and formation of thick crusts which are dirty yellowish brown, often many layers thick, and firmly set over the dark red corium. The lesions of milder degrees occur in diffuse form over large areas, particularly on the neck and inside of the thighs. Those of the severest degree are generally localized to the udder, scrotum and perineum. Vesicles and pustules do not form, but the eruption on the udder is reminiscent of pox. Carasson (1921, 1932). The cutaneous manifestations are a constant symptom of rinderpest. They appear in the second stage of the attack simultaneously with conjunctivitis, stomatitis and diarrhoea, but in view of their small size and discrete nature they are generally noticed much later than the concomitant lesions. The red, round and more or less discrete or confluent spots (macules) occur on different parts of the body, more commonly where the skin is thin and the hair fine, less frequently on the upper parts of the body and the extremities, exceptionally below the hock or the knee. On these spots, the hair stands erect and, if the lesions are isolated, the small bunches of hair appear as in miliary ringworm. As they porgress, the macules rapidly become papules, and later vesico-pustules ; at this time they generally attract attention. In two or three days, transuda- tion starts, the pustules burst causing matting of the hair, and the picture varies according to the number and disposition of the lesions. When localized to areas of fine skin like the udder, and when they dry up, the crusts and the matted hair fall off leaving small gaps in the coat. The hair on these spots reappears slowly and the small ' tufts grow against the grain '. If, on the other hand, the pustules involve more or less large plaques, the skin gets raised by fluid collected in layers in the thickness of the dermis, but following transudation on the surface it subsides, when it may crepitate. Later, the corresponding pieces of epidermis fall off and the dermis which is laid bare is in a state of congestion, which disappears slowly, and is like a raw surface left after strong vesication or blistering. On these parts, the hair grows slowly, is always sparse, and its colour and direction are different from the surrounding coat. Such lesions are commonly encountered on the back, loins and croup. Very rarely, the eruptions become generalized, covering the whole body, and resulting in the forma- tion of large plaques. When the scabs from these areas fall off, an intensely congested, naked, and badly damaged skin is left behind, as in severe vesication. The deeper papillary layers of dermis are destroyed and the hair does not grow again ; veritable cicatrices remain. Eruptions as seen in Bengal The initial lesions, when noticed, are said to be in the form of small, discrete, reddish spots, ' like mosquito-bites ', appearing about the same time as the mouth lesions, diarrhoea, etc. These develop and turn into pustules about the size of a split pea in diameter, and some thick sero-purulent matter is discharged which causes the hair to mat in isolated bunches. The scabs which form stick to the body of the animal for about five to ten days, sometimes even longer, and, when the dried up crusts fall off, small hairless islets are left behind. New hair grow up after some time on these spots and in four to six weeks attains the level of the surrounding coat from which it may generally be distinguished by appreciable differences in colour and direction. In many cases, the pustules are ill developed, especially those on the back and chest, and there is little transudation, so that the crusts stick closely to the underlying skin and do not fall off until some weeks after their formation The commonest sites of the cutaneous eruptions seem to be the region of the shoulder and the ad- joining areas on the chest, back, neck and dewlap. They have, however, been noticed on almost
30 Cutaneous Eruptions in Rinderpest [VOL. XVIII, PART I, any part of the skin extending dorsally from the muffle to the anal region, laterally from the cheek to the back of the thighs, and ventrally from the jowl to the perineum in both sexes, including both sides of the upper parts of the legs. They make their appearance in a single crop, but their numbers may vary from a few scattered lesions to several hundreds, with a tendency to form groups of closely situated eruptions on some areas, when they may coalesce and on being shed leave behind bigger patches of raw skin. The severest types of lesions described by the European observers are seldom seen in Bengal, except occasionally in buffaloes in which many large pieces of epidermis may come off. ASSOCIATION OF ERUPTIONS WITH RINDERPEST Certain observers who appear to have had little experience of the true rinderpest exanthema have doubted the development of any specific eruptions in this disease and have even suggested that these may only be the result of some non-specific factors like tick-bites, impetigo, etc. While the possibility of such non-specific lesions being sometimes mistaken for true rinderpest exanthema, especially by those workers who have had no previous experience of the latter, cannot be denied, the eruptions which usually develop during the course of rinderpest can generally be recognized without much difficulty. Though the experience of workers in India and abroad left little doubt of the true relationship between the infection and the eruptions, it was considered desirable to provide some positive evidence to support this. In most of the outbreaks investigated ample clinical evidence diagnostic of rinderpest was available. Because of the delay which usually occurred in reporting and contacting the scene of the outbreak, blood transmission could not be undertaken. Attempts to transmit the infection with material consisting of scabs collected from affected animals in the ' field ' and transported to the laboratories in Calcutta had to be resorted to, so that usually many days elapsed before the material could be put to test. In all, about a dozen tests were done, with scab suspensions in 0.5 per cent saline inoculated sub-cutaneously into goats, calves and buffaloes, and also applied by scarification on the external ear. In the majority of cases, the results were negative, but in at least two instances the disease was definitely reproduced. In one of the positive cases, the scabs had remained at room temperature for nearly three weeks before test. Related clinical and epizootiological aspects The appearance of the cutaneous eruptions on animals affected with rinderpest has generally been a welcome feature in view of the popular belief that such attacks are comparatively mild and more commonly followed by recovery. A similar notion regarding many human diseases is also prevalent in many parts of the world. Actual scientific data in support of this contention have never been forthcoming, but the experience of most observers shows that the eruptions, though often seen in severely affected animals, are usually a feature of milder attacks. Again, they have been more commonly observed in outbreaks of moderate severity than in those accompanied by heavy mortality. The experience in Bengal has been identical and the eruptions have been much more commonly seen in isolated and mild outbreaks and towards the fag-end of bigger epizootics than in the midst of severe and widespread outbreaks. In view, however, of the nature and course of the eruptions, as already stated, their comparative infrequency in animals dying of acute attacks of rinderpest may be more apparent than real. Below are given (Table I) some relevant particulars of two outbreaks in which cutaneous eruptions developed. These may serve to illustrate the usual course of events in such cases.

Both in Bengal and elsewhere, the eruptions have been reported more frequently in cer- tain years (or series of years) than in others, but the exact significance of this variation is not understood. The identical nature of the popular labels given to rinderpest in different parts of the world (though very often the same labels have been used to designate many other diseases), and the fact that the cutaneous eruptions had attracted the particular attention of the earlier writers, are considered, perhaps correctly, by some modern observers to signify that originally rinderpest was more a skin affection, like vaccinia, than a generalized organic infection, as commonly seen now-a-days. It seems possible that rinderpest virus is gradually becoming more organotropic and less dermotropic. Even to-day, some observers in Bengal would go so far as to assert the occur- rence of non-fatal outbreaks of more or less pure ' cutaneous form of the disease, unaccompanied by much systemic disturbance beyond a little rise in temperature. There have been at least two such instances in this Province in the recent past, but the opinions of experienced officers who visited the affected place were sharply divided about the authenticity of these outbreaks. Unfortunately, no conclusive proof by way of biological tests was secured and the disease could not be reproduced by inoculation of scab material, so that it is not possible to make any decisive statement about the outbreaks. The eruptions in most cases were in a very much exaggerated form and, on the whole, were very unlike those usually seen in rinderpest. MacGregor (loc. cit.) has included photographs of these eruptions. Some workers have tried to seek some sort of relationship between the eruptions and the pre- vailing weather conditions. Thus, Malfrey [1927] considers them to be more frequent in the rainy season, especially on those animals which are exposed to showers of rain. According to him, the eruption is a reaction of the hyperaemic skin to the rain, while Curasson quotes Schein as regarding G
32 Cutaneous Eruptions in Rinderpest. [VOL. XVIII, PART 1, it a reaction to the Sun rays. The recent outbreaks of ' cutaneous ' rinderpest in Bengal were not confined to any particular part of the year, but the majority of them occurred during the rainy season and in the autumn (i.e., April to November), when both atmospheric temperature and humidity are high. There has, however, been no regional localization, almost all parts of the Province having reported eruptions at different times. The annual rainfall in the different districts varies from about 55 to about 130 inches. As a rarely, or even frequently, developing symptom of rinderpest, the cutaneous eruptions are perhaps of no more than a little clinical interest to-day. There is no doubt that the scabs tend to stick to the affected animals for several days and thus may play some part in disseminating the infection, in view of the fact that the rinderpest virus may persist in them in a viable condition. Their rôle in the causation of the so-called ' spontaneous ' outbreaks of the disease [MacGregor, loc. cit.], however, seems to have been unduly exaggerated, like that of the hides. SUMMARY 1. A consolidated summary of some observations recently made in Bengal concerning the appear- ance of cutaneous eruptions in cattle affected with rinderpest is given along with a résumé of literature on the subject. 2. The nature and course of these eruptions are described and some related clinical and epizootio- logical aspects are discussed. REFERENCES Carlier (1920). Cited by Curasson, 1932 Croveri, P. (1921).

(Cited by Curasson, 1932) VERMINOUS PNEUMONIA IN ANIMALS IN BENGAL By *RAM NARAIN MOHAN, 34 Verminous Pneumonia in Animals in Bengal [VOL. XVIII, PART I, Clinically, the disease was ushered in by an occasional dry and husky cough which generally passed unnoticed till it gradually became more frequent. As the disease progressed, there was some loss of condition accompanied by depressed appetite and irregular bowels. Later on, there was some discharge from the nose, usually in the form of masses of mucus expelled during paroxysms of cough- ing. In fatal cases, extensive involvement of the lungs became apparent and all the symptoms of a true pneumonia developed, marked dyspnoea being prominent. In animals thus affected there was a more or less complete loss of appetite, the rectal temperatures rose high, and many developed diarrhoea. Once true pneumonia set in, death followed in a fortnight or so, though occasional cases lingered somewhat longer. Recoveries were common only in those cases which did not show signs of the lungs being involved to any 'considerable extent. On post-mortem examination of a few carcases, the organs found mainly affected were the gs. These commonly showed extensive consolidation accompanied by varying degrees of thicken- and distension of the inter-lobular septa in parts. In some cases, there were either small dis- e foci or bigger areas of suppuration. The basic morbid change uniformly present was an in- titial cum catarrhal pneumonia, typical of verminous pneumonia. There was no evidence of iritis. The trachea, and especially the bronchi, showed inflammatory and catarrhal changes they always contained the worms, Dictyocaulus viviparus, generally in large numbers. On microscopical examination, numerous typical metastrongyle eggs and larvae were seen in fresh cover-glass preparations of lung exudate. Stained films of the exudate revealed a variety of organisms among which chiefly two types predominated. In films made from the more or less uni- formly consolidated non-suppurating parts, the predominant organism was a Gram-negative cocco- bacillus having some tendency towards ' bipolar ' staining, while in those from suppurating parts it was a Gram-positive diphtheroid. Due to lack of suitable facilities no cultural work could be undertaken, so that it is not possible to state the exact identity of these organisms. It may be men- tioned here, that in studies undertaken earlier by the author at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, on the bacteriological flora of normal and pathological lungs of ruminants, the two pathogenic organisms most commonly isolated were Corynebacterium pyogenes and those known as ' haemolytic cocco-bacilli '. This is similar to the findings of other workers abroad [Bos- worth and Lovell, 1944]. In view of this, it seems likely that these two were the organisms second- arily concerned in this outbreak also. Stained films of peripheral blood of affected animals and peripheral and heart blood of carcases were uniformly negative. Histological examination confirmed the macroscopic and the micros- copic findings. The basic picture was that of verminous pneumonia, but at many places this was more or less completely masked by the superimposed bacterial pneumonia. The results of these investigations left little doubt with regard to the correct nature of the diagnosis. It was nevertheless considered desirable to examine the possibility of co-existing con- tagious bovine pleuropneumonia. This was ruled out by the complete lack of reaction in two bulls inoculated subcutaneously with lung exudate from a somewhat suspicious case. The affection did not spread to the suckling calves and the few deaths which occurred among them in this period were due to other causes. LUNG-WORMS IN SHEEP Dictyocaulus filaria and the pulmonary changes associated with it, i.e., typical verminous pneu- monia, were often encountered in plains sheep in Calcutta slaughter-houses. Their occurrence in hill sheep in Darjeeling slaughter-house was noted to be more common and the infested lungs generally showed patchy consolidation, especially in the apical and cardiac lobes [Mohan, 1945]. Balwant Singh [1937] encountered Varestrongylus pneumonicus also in a few hill sheep. Bengal is not a sheep-raising country and the occurrence of fatal outbreaks of pneumonia in this species is not known.
MARCH 1948] RAM NARAIN MOHAN 35 LUNG-WORMS IN GOATS Mortality due to verminous pneumonia in goats in Bengal was first investigated and reported by Balwant Singh [1938, 1939, 1940], who found almost all flocks in Darjeeling district affected. The extent of affection and mortality in these flocks was very variable, but there were instances of whole flocks having been lost. The lung-worm most commonly encountered was Varestrongylus pneumonicus. In some cases, Dictyocaulus filaria was also present. The infestation was generally heavy and the lungs showed evidence of severe broncho-pneumonia accompanied by much consolidation, especially of the anterior lobes. Scattered patches of pure verminous pneumonia were a constant feature. The histological features were, an interstitial cum broncho-pneumonia, marked by the presence of worms, eggs and larvae in sections (as in lung exudate), and in some cases purulent foci were seen. The disease could not be reproduced by experimental inoculations with lung exudate and a Pasteurella type of organism, once isolated from an affected lung, proved non-pathogenic for bovines. The main clinical symptoms were, gradually increasing loss of condition and a persistent cough which was dry in the earlier stages but moist and accompanied by a muco-purulent nasal discharge in advanced cases. The rectal temperatures often rose to 106°F and some goats developed diarrhoea. The disease was found more prevalent during the winter months. LUNG-WORMS IN SWINE The occurrence of Metastrongylus elongatus in pigs in Bengal has also been noted [Balwant Singh, 1937 ; Mohan, 1945]. Balwant Singh found these worms in nearly 50 per cent of slaughtered pigs. Mohan has recorded serious mortality caused by pneumonia in piglings of a big commercial farm in Darjeeling district. The two worms which seemed to be concerned in mortality were Matastrongy- lus elongatus and Ascaris lumbricoides. In most cases in which the lungs were extensively conso- lidated, the bronchi were found packed with dense masses of M. elongatus, and there was little doubt of their fatal rôle. In those few cases in which the lung-worms were few or absent, the round worms, which were present in very large numbers in the intestines of such animals, must have contributed considerably towards undermining the general health of the piglings and, in view of their life-cycle, may also have had some part in causing pneumonia. Microscopical and histopathological examina- tions revealed numerous metastrongyle eggs and larvae and small Gram-negative cocco-bacillary organisms, the latter generally present in the form of large focal agglomerations. The recording of Metastrongylus elongatus in this country is of special interest. Baylis and Daubney [1923] recorded only fragmentary material of this species from the bronchi of a pig in the collection of the Zoological Survey of India. In view of this, Baylis [1936] says, 'it is uncertain whether the specimens were of Indian origin ', though Bhalerao [1935] has included the worm in his catalogue of the helminth parasites of domestic animals in India. The present record should leave no doubt of the widespread occurrence of this parasite in India, as it has been repeatedly encountered in the hills and the plains, and in pigs bred locally, in Orissa, and in the United Provinces. SUMMARY 1. The occurrence of lung-worms and verminous broncho-pneumonia in domestic animals in Bengal is recorded. 2. Fatal outbreaks of pneumonia, primarily verminous, in adult cattle, goats and piglings are described. 3. The worms incriminated are Dictyocaulus viviparus in cattle, Dictyocaulus filaria in sheep, Varestrongylus pneumonicus in goats, and Metastrongylus elongatus in pigs. The occasional occurrence of Dictyocaulus filaria in goats and Varestrongylus pneumonicus in sheep is noted. 4. Metastrongylus elongatus may be accepted as a well established parasite of pigs in India.
36 Verminous Pneumonia in Animals in Bengal [VOL. XVIII, PART I, REFERENCES Balwant Singh (1937). An. Rep. Vet. Investigation Officer, Bengal, for 1936-37 DENTITION IN INDIAN CATTLE By H. K. LALL, B.Sc., M.R.C.V.S., Assistant Animal Husbandry Commissioner with the Government of India, New Delhi (Received for publication on 8 October 1947) INDIAN farmers, veterninarians and others when ageing cattle, have not employed the western stan- dards but have modified them in accordance with experience. There exist no easily available recorded data concerning what these modifications should be, and it was, therefore, decided with the help of government farm staff to make observations anew and to record them forthwith. What follows is the result of that work. The permanent dentition of the ox consists of the following teeth 0033 / 4033 . The temporary or milk dentition is 0030 / 4030. Observation has been made of the teeth of individuals in various age groups in most of the import- ant breeds of the country, viz. Hariana (from Bengal, Hissar, Quaderabad and the United Provinces districts), Sindhi, Sahiwal (from the Punjab and Delhi), Hallikars, Ongoles, Kanngyam, Amritmahal (from Bombay and Mysore). Gir, Dangi, Kherrigahr and Ponwar. The number of animals examined, in various ages has varied in each case according to the facilities or the number of the animals avail- able at the time of the examination, but on account of the similarity in the samples, statistically, it is considered that the number of animals examined are enough and can be taken to represent the population of that breed as a whole. Teeth were examined at one month (in some cases), three months, six months, one year, one and a half years, two years (in some cases), two and a half years, three years, four years, four and a half years (in some cases), five years and six years. The dentition observed at each of these age periods probably represents the dentition at the age specified plus or minus one month because of possible inaccuracy in the dates of birth or because of the fact that in some farms the animals are aged according to the quarter of the year in which they are born. The following Table I illustrates the order of eruption of the teeth of individuals of the Hariana breed. TABLE I Eruption of the various teeth in Hariana Cattle Time of eruption Incisors Molars 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 At 1 month . . . . . . . . . . . . 38 Dentition in Indian Cattle [VOL. XVIII, PART I, All temporary incisors and the first, second and third temporary molars are present at one month. The fourth permanent molar erupts in 33 per cent of the animals at the age of six months, and is completely up in all the animals by nine months. At one and a half years the fifth permanent molar is up in 50 per cent of the animals, while at two years all the permanent molars except the third are through and rising. At two and a half years they are well up. The first pair of incisors are just rising in 50 per cent of the animals at two years, while at two and half years they are well up. By the third year the first and second pairs of incisors are up, and the set of permanent molars is complete. In the fourth year the third pair of incisors is up. The third pair of incisors are up soon after one month of the second pair. The corner pairs appear sometimes in the fourth year but are only well up at four and half a years. The permanent dentition is complete between four and a half to five years, and all the four pairs of incisors have been brought into wear. In the Hariana cattle examined in Bengal, dentition is slightly later. The fourth permanent molar is seen in all cases at about nine months, and the first pair of incisors in all cases is erupted at two and a half years. In all other breeds the same type of dentition is observed as in the Harianas in Bengal, i.e. the first pair of incisors is up at two and a half years, and the permanent dentition is complete at five years. Differences are observed in the case of Amritmahal, in some of which full mouth is obtained a bit later. In Ponwars, the fourth permanent molar erupts at three months, while the fourth and fifth both are well up at six months. At nine months the sixth permanent molars are up. The first pair of incisors erupts at one and a half years, the second at three years and the third and fourth at four years. Some observations were made in the case of Terai buffalo, in which dentition closely corresponds to that of Ponwar. In Sahiwals, except that the fourth permanent molar is up earlier, i.e. it starts erupting at three months, and is up at six months, the usual trend of dentition is the same as in the Hariana and the same is the case with the Sindhis. The Sahiwal herd at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, which is kept under an intensive system of management, did not show any significant variation in dentition from other Sahiwals. The central permanent incisors are up at two years, corners start coming up at four years one month or so in number of cases and the mouth is complete at four and a half to five years. Table I may therefore be taken to represent the dentition more or less for all the breeds in India except for minor differences here and there and for the fact that in most of them (except Harianas and Sahiwals in the Punjab) the first pair of incisors is up at two and a half years. All the animals examined were from the various Government farms, but as no intensive feeding on western lines is practised (except where stated) in any of these farms, it is likely that the dentition in village cattle will be very much the same. There was no difference however, in dentition, between the males and females. Buffaloes The dentition in buffaloes is more or less the same as that of Indian cattle. In their case, the central as well as the medial temporary incisors are up even at birth. At one month the three pairs and at three months all the four pairs are up. At three months the corners are just erupting and are overlapped at laterals. This overlapping of the corner is noticeable at six months but none is observed at one year when wearing surfaces are also more extended. At two years, corners have a characteristic depression on the wearing surface and the centrals are more spaced and have a necked appearance. At two and a half years, the central pair of permanent incisors is seen and the depression in the temporary corners is disappearing. The medical pair of permanent incisors comes up at three and a half years. According to Capt. Hayard, I.A.V.C., through whose courtesy information on buffaloes has been obtained, the date of eruption of laterals is very variable because some animals develop six permanent incisors at three and a half years, while others have only four permanent molars at four years. At six years, all the permanent incisors are up while the corner incisors develop a hook at the seventh year and the centrals show a star (enamel line). At eight years, the corner incisors appear more worn ; the hook of the wearing surface disappears and the wearing surface of the central, middle and lateral incisors begin to show the star : from the front view, the teeth appear longer and more ridged. The molar teeth were not examined.
MARCH 1948] H. K. LALL 39 The horns give no indication of the age in adult buffaloes as individual rings cannot be definitely distinguished. It is ovserved that the teeth in our cattle erupt at a later stage than those of English ones. In common English cattle brought up under ranch conditions, according to Miller and Robertson [1937] the first pair of incisors is up at one year and nine months to two years, the second at two and a half years, the third at three years and the fourth at three and a half years, to four years. In the case of molars the fourth permanent molar arises at six months, the fifth at one year and three months to one and a half years, the sixth at two years, the first and second at two and a half years, and the mouth is complete at three and a half years, to four years. Robertson and Miller's figures for ranch cattle and Ellenberger and Baum's figures indicating the ages of eruption of permanent teeth for breeds maturing late, correspond to some extent with those obtained in the case of our cattle, and are given in the Table II.

MUKHERJEE and D. PARTHASARATHY, Poultry Research Section, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 26 August 1947) IN the absence of information on the digestibility of certain Indian poultry feeds the authors have determined the digestible nutrients of three comparatively cheap cereal grains cheena, jowar (Sorghum vulgare) and ragi (Eleusine coracana). Experiments on two other grains, viz. barley and bajra (Pennesetum typhoideum, bulrush millet), for which foreign data are available, have also been conducted to see if the figures given by western workers hold good for similar Indian grains. Except ragi, the grains studied are sparingly used for human consumption in India. An investigation of their value as poultry-feeds is necessary since such staple cereals as rice and wheat are often in short supply in this country and should be used sparingly in rations for livestock. Katayama [1924] and Halnan [1926] for obvious reasons, used indirect methods of determining digestibility coefficients of poultry feeds by analysing the mixed excreta and making use of certain equations. These equations are given by Katayama (Loc. cit) and are based on data obtained on only two birds, before and after operation. The formulae as reproduced in an article by Halnan [1926] are as follow: 1. Dung Nitrogen=Excretory N-(Uric acid N-free ammonia N) 114.6 per cent/102.3 per cent 2. Urinary Nitrogen=Excretory N-Dung N 3. Urinary organic matter=Urinary N × 3.26 4. Urinary ether extract=Organic urinary matter × 108 per cent This method of computation has been used in this study. Fraps [1920] has determined the digestibility of a large number of feeds taking the urinary products as consisting entirely of uric acid and ammonia. Though this method has been used by a number of other workers it is undoubtedly less accurate. EXPERIMENTAL The cereal grains were fed singly, without the addition of any other feed to adult desi (indigenous) cockerels between 1 and 1½ years of age. They were housed individually in roomy (16 × 12 × 16 in.) metabolism cages with wire bottom. The mixed excreta were collected on polished glass-plates placed under each cage. Food was provided in wooden boxes and water in triangular tins fastened to the sides of the cages. The birds were kept in their respective cages for a few weeks before the experiment so that they become used to the environment. Each metabolism experiment was preceded by a preliminary period of five days with a collection period of seven to eight days. The birds were weighed on two days, viz. at the commencement and end of the digestibility trial, the average weight being used for calculation. During the metabolism experiment a weighed quantity of the test feed, the amount of which was based on the consumption of each bird during the preliminary period was offered to the cockerels. Any food left over was weighed. Every attempt was made to feed an adequate amount of diet and to ensure an uniform intake throughout the period of observation. The birds were given 1 gm. of common salt and 2 gm. of limestone-grit along with their daily diet and water was always available to them. Every morning, the excreta were scraped and collected in glass-stoppered bottles after mixing with 10 c.c. of 10 per cent acetic acid after collection. The glass stoppered bottles were kept at 30°F to arrest fermentation. At the end of the experimental period the pooled sample was rendered distinctly acidic by adding acetic acid, mixed thoroughly and weighed. Suitable quantities were then weighed out into tared porcelain dishes and dried in an electric oven at a temperature not exceeding 70°C. The dried material was ground finely, passed through a sieve to remove any pieces of feather and stored in glass-stoppered bottles for subsequent analysis. 41 K
42 The Digestible Nutrients of certain Cereal Grains [VOL. XVIII, PART I, The total nitrogen was estimated by the Kjeldahl method while the ether extract, fibre and ash were determined by the A.O.A.C. procedure. Bose's method [1944] was used for uric acid and ammoniacal nitrogen was obtained by following Van Slykes aeration method using a mixture of methylene blue and methylred [deWasselow] as indicator [Cole 1933]. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The composition of the grains used is given in Table I and the digestibility figures in Table II. Of the five cereals studied only two viz., barley and. bajra (bulrush millet) have been studied by pre- vious workers Fraps [1928] and Halnan [1928] and the results are compared in Table III. Table IV contains an abstract of the results and the values for digestible protein and starch equivalent. The starch equivalent was calculated in the usual manner using the normal figures. Individual variation. With cheena there is little variation in the digestible coefficients among individual birds, except for crude fibre which is not of much importance in poultry. In the case of ragi the digestibility figures for protein vary fairly widely while those for crude fibre are erratic as in other cases. Barley showed a comparatively wide variation in the digestibility coefficients of crude fat and nitrogen free extract. This may be due to the fact that barley is not very palatable to poultry and the food intake and faecal output are both irregular. The individual figures for bajra and jowar tally except in respect of crude fibre. The crude fibre of jowar does not seem to be digested at all.

TABLEIII Comparison of present observations with those available in literature MARCH 1948] R. MUKHERJEE AND D. PARTHASARATHY 45 The protein values of ragi, jowar and bajra are comparatively low (Table 1). Although individual samples of the same grain may differ fairly widely in protein content. The available Indian data show that the above millets have a lower protein content than wheat, barley, maize or oats. Conse- quently in spite of the high digestibility coefficients of protein, the three millets rank comparatively low in digestible protein. The digesible protein of jowar, however, does not represent the appropriate value for this millet since our sample contained less protein than is generally found in Indian samples. On this basis it can be classed with bajra and ragi in respect of digestible protein and may be considered inferior to barley or cheena. Barley is richer than the other four grains in digestible protein, while cheena is of intermediate value. It is recognized that the digestible protein figure alone is insufficient to enable one to judge the value of a feed or ration as a source of available protein. SUMMARY The digestible nutrients as poultry feed of five common cereal grains, cheena, ragi, barley, bajra and jowar have been determined. The starch equivalent and digestible protein were calculated from these data. Bajra and jowar were found to be equally superior to the other three grains. Regard- ing their starch value they are indeed as rich as wheat. Barley was found to be the poorest in net energy content while ragi and cheena were of intermediate quality. The digestibility coefficients and starch equivalent figures for bajra and barley agreed well with those obtained by Western workers. The grains arranged in decreasing order of digestible protein content stand as under : barley, cheena, bajra or ragi or jowar, the last three millets being of equal value, and barley the richest of all.

MUKHERJEE, Poultry Research Section, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 26 August 1947) IN view of the importance of manganese in poultry nutrition, the manganese content of some poul- try feeds, commonly used in India, was determined to see if rations compounded from them are sufficient with respect to their manganese content. Though figures for some of these feeds used in foreign countries are available, the Indian products have been examined for comparison in order to find out if they show any variation. The manganese content of some Indian feeds have been determined, in a different connection, by Rudra [1939] and Sundara Rao [1940]. We have included in our list some feeds studied by these workers to see if any differences exist ascribable to soil variations. MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUE The cereals and their by-products were purchased locally except ragi which was obtained from Madras. As far as possible only the portions of leafy vegetables which are not used for human consump- tion have been used for the estimation. These and other grasses were obtained from the institute farm. The A.O.A.C. (1940) method using ammonium persulphate was employed in several cases. In cases, however, where the concentration of chlorides was high, the method of Willard and Greathouse [1917] with slight modifications was employed, as in our experience the latter method produced a colour which was brighter and stable for longer periods, while the colour produced by the persulphate method was somewhat dull and faded out quickly. The modified method of Willard and Greathouse was as follows : The sample was ashed in a silca crucible at dull-red heat. The ash was dissolved in a small quantity of concentrated nitric acid, about 5 c.c. of syrupy phosphoric acid and sufficient quantity of distilled water were added till the crucible was about three-fourths full. The solution was heated for about 30 minutes on a water bath for complete extraction of the ash, then cooled, filtered and washed. To the filtrate, in a 150 c.c beaker, about 0.3 g. of potassium periodate was added and the beaker heated on water bath till the maximum colour developed. The solution was cooled and compared in a colorimeter with a standard solution of manganous sulphate similarly treated. In preliminary experiments to compare the above procedure with the A.O.A.C. [1940] method using ammonium persulphate, agreement was found to be fairly close. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The results of the determination are given in Table I which shows that certain cereal by-products such as rice bran and wheat bran are excellent sources of manganese. Ragi used in South India by human beings and for poultry is also a good source of this element. The low manganese in polished rice may be due to milling. Bajra, cheena, jowar and barley are poor sources and when the ration consists entirely of these, the inclusion of necessary supplements in the form of manganese sulphate or other concentrates may be necessary to get the optimum level of manganese. The cakes of linseed, groundnut and mustard seem to be moderate sources. Limestone is a good source but there is much variation from sample to sample. Among the green feeds studied cowpeas appear to be a very good 47 M

PARTHASARATHY, Poultry Research Section, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 26 August 1947) THERE is a little information on the nutritive vaue of the proteins of certain cereal grains fed either singly or in combination to poultry in India. The biological value of some of these grains for rats is known ; but the value of a protein for poultry must be assessed by conducting experiments on the birds themselves since their amino acid requirements are different from those of rats [Almquist, 1941]. The lack of information on the nutritive value of proteins for poultry is due mainly to the fact that urine and faeces are excreted through a common opening and their separate collection is impossible unless artificial means are adopted. The following review indicates the methods used to tide over this difficulty. Fields and Ford [1900] and Brown [1904] assumed that the sum of uric acid and ammonia nitrogen represented the urinary nitrogen and they subtracted this sum from the total nitrogen to get the faecal nitrogen. This method is not sound since uric acid and ammonia nitrogen form only a part of the urinary nitrogen. Coulson and Hughes [1930]. and St John, Johnson, Carver and Moore [1932] calculated the urinary nitrogen by taking the sum of uric acid and ammonia nitrogen as 80 per cent of the total urinary nitrogen. The flaw in this method is, the arbitrary assumption of the factor 80 per cent. Paraschtshuk [1902], Lehmann [1904] and others produced an aritficial anus by operation and collected the faeces and urine separately. This method has been criticized because the bird is under a strain. Katayama [1924] used a correction factor based on analysis of mixed excreta of normal birds and of urine and faeces of the same birds after operation but this cannot be regarded as accurate since the experiment was conducted on only two birds. The method of* Heller Morris and Shirley [1930] based on the mechanical separation and analysis of the 'white caps' cannot be expected to yield accurate results. The urine residue found in the front of a normal excretion is commonly known as ' white cap '. Mitchell [1924] proposed a method, later elaborated by Ackerson, Blish and Mussehl [1926] to determine the efficiency of dietary protein. The nitrogen excretion of birds on a diet practically free from nitrogen was first determined for calculating the biological value of the protein. Ackerson, Blish and Mussehl [1929] thus obtained the comparative efficiency of various proteins of cereals when fed to poultry at varying levels of nitrogen in-take. Macdonald and Bose [1944] also employed this method in principle and we have used it with slight modifications in these investigations where the efficiency of proteins of five cereals, viz. cheena, jowar, bajra, ragi and barley, commonly used as poultry feeds in India has been determined. EXPERIMENTAL The nitrogen balance trials were carried out on adult desi (indigenous) cockerels. The feeding, management and other experimental technique was the same as in our previous study [Mukherjee and Parthasarathy (in press)]. The experimental rations consisted of a single kind of grain with daily supplements of about 1 g. of common salt and 2 g. of limestone grit per bird. The metabolism periods were of 10 days and were preceded by adjustment periods of five to seven days. Throughout each metabolism experiment, the birds were fed a constant amount of food sufficient to meet the energy requirement and maintain body weight. The endogenous and metabolic nitrogen of the birds was determined by feeding them on a nitrogen-free diet composed of sago, common salt, limestone-grit, potassium phosphate and supplements of 'Adexolin ' and ' Berin'. (These are patents of Glaxo Laboratories which were fed orally. ] drop of ' Adexolin ' daily and J c.c. of a sus- pension of 1 tablet of ' Berin ' in 5 c.c. of distilled water, per bird.) The metabolism and adjustment periods of the nitrogen-free experiment were seven and five days respectively. This diet was well relished by the birds, and they maintained weight during the experiment Seven birds were fed the 51 N
52 Biological Values of the Proteins [ VOL. XVIII, PART I, nitrogen-free diet and the total nitrogen in the excreta, uric acid nitrogen and ammonia N were determined. The endogenous N and faecal metabolic nitrogen were calculated by Coulson and Hughes' formula (Loc. cil). Total N of dried excreta was determined by the Kjeldahl method. The ammonia N was estimated by the Van Slyke aeration method using a mixture of methylene blue and methyl red as indicator Cole [1933]. To 1 g. of the excreta 3-5 of potassium carbonate and a few c.c. of distilled water were added and the aeration carried out for three hours. Parallel experiments with and without acidi- fication of the excreta with HCl before adding potassim carbonate, showed that subsequent acid treatment was not necessary when the excreta was dried after acidification with acetic acid. The uric acid was estimated as by Bose [1944]. The urinary nitrogen was calculated on the basis that uric acid and ammonia N represented 80 per cent of total urinary nitrogen. The faecal nitrogen was obtained by subtracting the computed value of urinary nitrogen from the total nitrogen. In the case of jowar, it was assumed, for the reasons mentioned later on that the sum of uric acid and ammonia nitrogen formed 90 per cent of the urinary nitrogen. The results were calculated according to the following formulae Mitchell [1924]. (1) Food N-(Faecal N-Metabolic N)/Food N × 100 = True coefficient of digestibility. (2) Food N-(Faecal N-Metabolic N)- (urinary N-endogenous N) × 100/Food N-(Faecal N-Metabolic N)=Biological value. DISCUSSION The metabolism data on nitrogen-free diet (Table I) show that the average endogenous N was 85 mg. per kg. body weight and the average metabolic faecal nitrogen was 0.0884 g. per 100 g. dry matter in-take. In these studies each nitrogen feeding period was not preceded by a nitrogen- free period. This step was omitted since according to Ackerson et al [1929]. Individual standardiz- ation of the subject produces no greater accuracy of results than the use of an average value for the endogenous nitrogen excretion in calculating biological values. It has been assumed that in birds as in animals the metabolic faecal nitrogen is proportional to the dry matter in-take and that endo- genous N is proportional to body weight. The average values thus calculated have accordingly been used in the computation of endogenous and metabolic nitrogen excreted during the nitrogen feeding periods for the calculation of biological values. The compostion of the cereal grains in these experiments is given in Table II. The biological values (Tables III-VI) are calculated on the assumption that the uric acid nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen represent 80 per cent of the total urinary nitrogen. But, in the case of jowar (Table VII) this assumption gave negative values for faecal nitrogen which strengthens the doubt of Van Landing- ham, Clark and Schneider [1942] whether with all diets uric acid and ammonia N represent a constant percentage of the total urinary N. We have therefore assumed, purely on an arbitrary basis, that the sum of uric acid N and ammonia N forms 90 per cent of the total urinary nitrogen on the jowar diet and thus obviated the difficulty of negative values for faecal nitrogen. Macdonald and Bose determined the biological values of three mashes for which the 80 per cent basis might possibly hold good as in the case of the remaining four feeds in the present observation, More extensive studies with a larger number of feeds are required to settle this point. The results obtained for jowar show that the uric acid N and ammonia N do not remain a constant percentage of the urinary nitrogen with all diets.

Alongside are also given the biological values as determined by rat experiments [Aykroyd, 1940]. It appears that bajra, ragi and barley have nearly the same biolo- gical value. The biological value of bajra was the same for rats and fowls but in the case of the other three cereals the values for the two species differed markedly. These observations support the view of Almquist (Loc. cit) that the amino acid requirements of the fowl are different from those of the rat and that the values obtained with the latter do not hold good for the former.

In protein values (which take into consideration both the biological values and the digestibility coefficients bajra is the richest, barley and ragi coming next. while jowar and cheena are the poorest. According to Halnan also, bajra (bulrush millet) is a very good food and is akin to wheat in feeding value. Further work with laying birds and growing chickens is necessary to obtain more evidence on this point. SUMMARY The biological values and digestibility coefficients of the proteins of five cereal grains jowar cheena, bajra, ragi and barely used commonly as poultry feeds in India have been determined by the balance method using adult cockerels for experiment. The average biological values are 56, 56, 85, 81 and 82 per cent respectively. In protein value bajra is found to be the best, barley and ragi next best and jowar and cheena the poorest. Evidence is presented to show that the sum of uric acid nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen does not remain a constant percentage of the urinary nitrogen with all diets. O

ABSTRACTS WILLIAM ORR (1945). Observations on Rinderpest in Goats Imported to Malaya Jour. Comp. Path. & Ther. 55, 185-200 SOME years before 1939, the Malayan governments prohibited the importation of cattle, sheep and goats from India on account of the danger of introducing rinderpest and other diseases. This measure, together with the constant vigilance of the veterinary departments, enabled these govern- ments to eradicate rinderpest from Malaya and only occasional localized outbreaks of the disease due to the introduction of infection from other countries continued. In 1939, however, military require- ments made it necessary to relax these restrictions and to import large numbers of goats from India. When consignments were expected to arrive Singapore was overcrowded with highly susceptible Bali-oxen, which had been imported to supplement the local stock of food. The indigenous water- buffalo of Malaya is also highly susceptible to rinderpest. The consequences of introducing the disease to this susceptible stock would have been disastrous specially at a time when conservation of existing food was of major importance. The consignments of goats from India arrived at Singapore and rinderpest was detected in them on arrival. So, without regard to the immediate losses, it was decided to eradicate this infection the slaughter and disposal of all the animals in the shipments involved. Four consignments arrived, comprising 1.500 goats in all. The disease manifested itself in an unusually virulent form and caused heavy mortality. In one of these four consignments, rinderpest was not diagnosed immediately on arrival at the port. The disease however, made its appearance within 24 hours of the landing of the animals and rapidly assumed epizootic form within the next 48 hours. Of the first consignment of 500 goats shipped at Calcutta, 40 died on the. voyage, 191 died within eight days of arrival and the rest were destroyed. In the second consignment of 500 goats 72 died on the way, 272 died in seven days after arrival and the rest were destroyed in a moribund state. In the third consignment of 200 goats shipped from Calcutta two died of other causes on the voyage and the remaining 198 goats showed no evidence of disease on arrival. But the disease was noticed the next day. Six animals died within two days after arrival and on. the third day the. remaining animals including 19 sick animals were all slaughtered. In the last consignment of 300 goats shipped from Calcutta 16 animals were lost on the voyage, 19 died within two days after arrival and the rest including 37 sick animals were all destroyed. Rinderpest was detected in a consignment of goats shipped from Calcutta to Penang at about the same time. Biological tests carried out with material obtained from this batch of goats in Bali- oxen and indigenous goats in Penang showed that this rinderpest virus was highly infectious and virulent. The peracute and fatal reactions that followed in the experimental animals were essentially similar to those observed in these animals following infection with rinderpest virus of bovine origin. The symptoms and post-mortem lesions observed in these goats at Singapore are described in great detail. The author also refers to Whitworth's account of an undiagnosed disease which occurred among Indian goats imported to Singapore in 1935 and which was suspected as rinderpest and com- pares it with the disease that occurred in 1941. After this outbreak, it was decided to discontinue further importation of Indian goats to Malaya pending a revision of the conditions under which the traffic might be resumed. But the outbreak of hostilities in Malaya in December, 1941. prevented the resumption of importation. [P.R.K.I.]. 57 P

The authors report their findings on nine dairy cows. Six of them were uncomplicated cases of ketosis, one of mild ketosis complicated with metritis and cystic ovary and two of mild ketosis compli- cated with enteritis. Six to 18.5 million units of vitamin A were given to the cows without any ameliorative effect. The authors conclude that vitamin A therapy in ketosis is of no value. A big dose had no favourable effect on the blood sugar and acetone bodies of the blood and urine. [N.D.K.] The Importance of Commercial Processing for the Protein Value Food Products. H. H. Mitcheli, T. S. Hamilton and J. R. Beadles (1945). J. Nut. 29,1, 13MARCH 1948] ABSTRACT 59 The animal experiments were conducted in the Southern Hemisphere in air-conditioned room and the duration of each experiment was seven hours, unless the fowl's life was threatened on account of high rectal temperature (113°F.). Air temperature of 80°F. (dry bulb) is comfortable for the fowl, but beyond this, slight disturbances of bodily functions become obvious. The fowl cannot safely withstand an air temperature of 100°F. for seven hours, unless the relative humidity is less than 75 per cent, while at 105°F, the fowl can with- stand only a few hours whatever be the humidity. The authors have observed, that if shade tempera- tures above 105°F. are likely to be experienced for more than one hour during the day, the well-being of the hens will be upset and death may occur. In Australia it has been observed that if at any time before 1 p.m. the air temperature exceeds 100°F. active precautions are necessary as it is likely to be a hot day and the temperatures remains high until 5 p.m. Ventilation of poultry houses is helpful in preventing exessive moisture and removing the heated air from houses. The provision of a constant and adequate water supply, permitting the bird to douse the heap whilst drinking, is stressed. It has been stated that the level of protein in the diet has nothing to do with heat tolerance. Hens can become acclimatized to hot environment but in the initial stages the acclimatization may be accompanied by a drop in eggs production. Six breeds of hens, consisting of both light and heavy, have been studied ; Leghorns (white and brown). Minorca. White Wyandotte, Australorp, and Rhode Island Red. Under hot conditions (105°F. with 25 per cent relative humidity) the White Leghorn showed the least rise of temperature and the Brown Leghorn the greatest, while the heavy breeds60 ABSTRACT [VOL. XVIII, PART 1, sheep of immature flukes was 12 ± 29.3 and that of adults was 2.07 ± 5.29. While necropsy of the latter lot showed immature flukes in three and mature flukes in one only and the mean number per sheep of immature flukes was10 ± 13.74 and that of adults was 0.57 ± 1.69. The results indicate that immature flukes are more resistant than mature ones. The author suggests that the treatment of animals should be undertaken during the season when there are fewest immature flukes in the body. To determine the effect of repeated administration of the drug, it was drenched to one small mature ewe and one yearling ram in daily doses of 30 and 60 c.c. for 12 and four days respectively and was found to be well tolerated by both. However, in a footnote, the author states, that some instances of intoxication and death occurred in one locality following treatment of sheep with hexachlorethane as well as with a standard dose of carbon tetrachloride.

(Published by the Imperial Bureau of Pastures and field Crops Aberyslwyth, Imperial Forestry Bureau, Oxford, and Imperial Bureau of Animal Nutrition Aberdeen, June 1947 Re. 0-9-0-) IN the foreword of this recent publication of the I. A. B., the reader is reminded of the importance of the subject with which it deals by the arresting statement that ' It is humbling fact for grass pasture experts to realize that probably more animals feed on shrubs and trees, or on associations in which shrubs and trees play an important part, than on true grass or grass-legume pastures, short and tall- grass ranges, and steppes '. A brief and very general description is given of the material, now available for grazing and brow- zing in vast areas on every continent, except Latin America (already dealt with in Bulletin 36) ; of the land on which it grows ; of the system, or lack of system, used by the graziers ; of observations made by the scientists and of their recommendation for regeneration, preservation and development; of a descriptive list of the fodder trees and shrubs found in each territory of the importance attached to them locally as animal feed. A valuable Table indicates the chemical composition of the edible parts, at various stages of growth of 486 of these trees and shrubs, and another, the nutritive value of 79 of them. Throughout the world, there is the same tale of ignorant misuse, if not, actual abuse of this indis- pensable fodder. Although it is within, only the last two or three decades that the subject has received any considerable scientific study, the authorities in each country apparently have little difficulty in confidentally recommending the action needed to stop deterioration. The lamentable fact remains however, that although one reads of what should be done and what could be done, there is little to be told of what has been done. In this respect, India is, with the United States, one of the countries which can report the results of trials actually made. One of the most useful parts of the publication, will probably be, found to be the list of references at the end of each section. [G. W.] MGIPCORIGINAL ARTICLES INVESTIGATION OF CONTAGIOUS ABORTION IN GOATS WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO ISOLATION OF Brucella Abortus (BANG) FROM GOATS' MILK* By P. R. NILAKANTAN and P. G. PANDE, Section of Pathology and Bacteriology, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, United Provinces (Received for publication on 13 January 1948) THERE exists a loose natural host specificity amongst the organisms of the genus Brucella para- sitizing cattle, goats and swine amongst the domestic animals. Of these, Brucella abortus, the common causative agent of bovine abortion has been recovered from naturally infected horses, fowls, dogs, sheep, wild dear, wild buffalo and human beings [Huddleson, 1943]. Br. meletensis, the organism of goat abortion, has been known to cause ' undulant fever ' in man and parasitizes cattle producing abortion in this class of animals. Br. suis, which causes abortion in sows, has been isolated from the horse, the fowl, the dog and human beings. Of the two species causing abortion in goats and cows, Br. meletensis may naturally infect cows [Parisot, Vidal and Levy, 1932 ; Giles, Peres and Culty, 1932 and Taylor, Lisbonne and Roman, 1932] the natural host of Br. abortus. Very little informa tion is really available regarding the susceptibility of goats to natural infection with Br. abortus, though the organism is capable of producing abortion in goats [Doyle, 1939] when introduced arti- ficially. Positive evidence regarding natural infection of goats with Br. abortus emanates from the work of Meurou and Pineau [1937] in France. These authors isolated a strain of Br. abortus from the milk and blood of a case of abortion in a goat that had remained for sometime in contact with an abort- ing heifer. Others, particularly Haddow [1934] in India and Holth [1937] in Norway carried out agglutination tests in large herds of goats and found a considerable number of reactors to Br. abortus antigen. In the present investigation Br. abortus was isolated from the milk of goats in a badly infected farm where cases of abortion in goats have been occurring annually since 1929. The finding reported in this paper, therefore, bears some significance in that, firstly, it tends to supplement an already meagre information on natural infectivity of goats to Br. abortus and secondly, it represents the only authentic record of the isolation of Br. abortus from goats in an infected farm. SHORT REVIEW OF PREVIOUS WORK The following review of work done during the past years has been prepared from the research record files maintained at this Institute. This showed, that most of the work was carried out with materials obtained from the Government Livestock Farm, Hissar, in the East Punjab. The first outbreak of the disease amongst Beetal goats of the Hissar Farm was reported in 1929. Agglutination test carried out with the sera of some of the aborted goats with the stock antigens of Br. abortus and Br. meletensis has yielded a negative result. Heart blood and the stomach con- tents of foetuses and the vaginal swabs of some freshly aborted female goats on cultural examination has yielded a stumpy cocci-like organism which did not agglutinate when put to test against the sera of aborted animals. In this outbreak, as a sequal to abortion, some goats were reported to have died of metritis. The condition was again reported in the following year in which Br. meletensis was isolated from the milk of one of the goats. In this outbreak the largest number of abortions occurred during September and November amongst the Jamunapari goats. A large number of sera put to agglutination tests with Br. abortus and Br. meletensis antigens was found to react positively against one or the other of these antigens.

62 Investigation on Contagious Abortion in Goats Vol. XVIII, Part II secretions and placentae from aborted goats on cultural examination did not yield any organism which could be incriminated for goat abortion. Drenching of infective placental emulsion to preg- nant goats has caused in one of the goats the expulsion of premature kid from which an orga nism suspected to be Vibrio foetus was isolated. Further study with this organism was not pursued and the results of the investigation was summarized with the conclusion that more than one orga nizm might be the cause of goat abortion on this farm. In 1933, sera from 175 goats consisting of Toggenburg, Jamunapari, Barbari and local breeds belonging to the Experimental and Research Goat Breeding Farm Etah, United Provinces, were tested against Br. abortus and Br. meletensis antigens. With the exception of four goats which reacted positively to Br. abortus antigen, the rest proved negative to both the antigens. In 1934, out of 54 sera from the same farm, only two reacted positively to Br. abortus. In 1935, out of 151 sera tested two proved suspicious and the rest negative to Br. meletensis antigen. The above review indicates that the previous investigations on caprine Brucellosis in India were mainly limited to agglutination test of sera from either known aborted cases or from in-contact animals on a farm where abortions had occurred. Bacteriological investigations carried out with infective materials received from some of the outbreaks did not afford any definite evidence regard- ing the isolation of Br. abortus from aborted goats' tissue or secretions. PRESENT INVESTIGATION The present investigations were carried out amongst goats of the Government Livestock Farm, Hissar, in the East Punjab. The farm comprising about 46,000 acres of land is essentially a cattle breeding farm, but other livestock including goats, sheep, horses, donkeys and camels are also bred though on a limited scale. The animals live under ranch conditions which provide sufficient grazing. Shelter from rains is provided during the monsoon period. Concentrates are fed to draft or working animals or to those in milk or pregnancy, according to requirements. As stated in the previous section of this paper the existence of Brucellosis amongst the goats of this farm has been proved by aggultination test in 1929. During the subsequent years also the disease had been occurring from time to time, but investigations carried out during these years with the object of determining the type of Brucella or any other microorganism involved in these out- breaks had failed to yield any conclusive results. The later efforts since 1937, therefore, were directed towards controlling of abortion rates by complete segregation of aborters and taking hygienic measures. Table I contains the incidence of abortion during 1937-1946. TABLE I The incidence of abortion during 1937-1946. Year Percentage of abortion 1937June, 1948. P. R. NILAKANTAN AND P. G. PANDE. 63 During the year 1937, the incidence of abortion had reached fairly a high figure of 13.1 per cent. and during the subsequent three years the hygienic control measures had brought about considerable improvement. Since the year 1940, it has been the routine practice in the farm to blood test all the goats for Brucellosis and remove the positive reactors separately, thus setting up two herds, e.g. the Brucella-positive and the Brucella-negative herds. The position as revealed by agglutina- tion test from the year 1940-1946 is given in Table II. TABLEII.

Two years later, when the herd was augmented by fresh purchases the incidence of reactors had again increased ; in 1945 no tests were made and the following years test showed some increase over the previous year. Brucella -negative herd This herd comprized of 214 goats on the basis of agglutination test carried out by one of us (P. R. N.) in August 1946. Of these, 11 were breeding bucks. Abortions had occurred in two goats 892 and 105 in the last week of July, i.e. about four to five weeks before visiting the farm. Blood serum of these animals were found negative for Brucella infection. Vaginal washing from each were inoculated subcutarneously in 1 c.c. dose to guinea pigs which were destroyed six weeks post injectio. Liver and spleen materials were cultured on crystal violet liver infusion-agar plates and incubated aero- bically as well as under 10 per cent Co2 tension at 37°C for seven days. No growth of Brucella in any of these were observed. Another goat 242 aborted on 20th September 1946. Heart blood and stomach contents of a three months old feotus expelled from the goat were sown in tryptose broth culture tubes which were sent to Mukteswar for incubation and isolation of the organism. No pathogenic organism was isolated from these materials. About 1 c.c. of a mixture of the stomach contents and heart blood of the foetus was inoculated simultaneously to a g. pig, but no growth of Brucella was observed on crystal violet-liver infusion-agar plates cultured with the spleen and liver materials of the g. pig destroyed six weeks post injectic. Milk samples obtained from this goat were cream separated and inoculated in 1.5 c.c. dose to two g. pigs. Another sample preserved in 1 per cent boric acid solution was sent to Mukteswar for cultural examination. No organism of pathogenic significance was iso- laled either from milk or the liver and spleen of the g. pigs. Blood serum of this goat was tested on the fourth day and three weeks after abortion for Brucellosis and Salmonellosis, but the results were negative for both.
64 Investigation on Contagious Abortion in Goats Vol. XVIII, Part II Brucella-positive herd This herd consisted of 12 adult she-goats, one breeding buck and a few kids. All the adult goats except the buck were found to be positive reactors. Of these, five were preganant, five had kidded three to four weeks before the farm was visited and two were sterile. No proper breeding history of this herd was available. One of the sterile goats was destroyed for the isolation of Brucella organism but no growth occurred on crystal violet-liver infusion-agar plates sown with liver and spleen materials of g. pigs inoculated with saline emulsions of the iliac and supra mammary lymphatic glands of the goat. Vaginal swabs and normal saline washings from the vaginae of goats 26, 685, 753, 918 and 985 which had recently kidded were cultured and inoculated into g. pigs respectively for the isolation of Brucella organism. No growths were observed after seven days' incubation of crystal violet-liver infusion-agar plates inoculated with the original swab material and the spleen and liver material of the g. pigs inoculated with the washings. Examination of milk About 10 c.c. of milk from each of the above five goats were collected in sterile tubes with aseptic precautions and kept in ice undisturbed for eight hours, 2 c.c. of cream from each sample were inoculated subcutaneously into g.pigs. The g. pig inoculated with the material from goat 26 died on the same day but no cultural examination was made due to highly putrified state of the carcase. Milk samples collected in the same manner and preserved in 10 per cent boric acid solution were also sent to Mukteswar for direct cultural examination, but no organisms were recovered from these samples. The remaining g. pigs were destroyed six weeks post injectio and their liver and spleen were cultured on crystal violet-liver infusion-agar plates which were incubated aerobically as well as under 10 per cent Co2 tension at 37°C. Five days after incubation, plates exposed to Co2 tention and sown with the liver and spleen materials of g. pigs inoculated with the cream samples from goats 753, 918 and 985 showed colonies similar to Brucella. The colonies were picked and subcultured on liver agar slants and grown under 10 per cent Co2 tension. Identification of the Brucella strains isolated Each of the three strains was examined as follows: 1. For morphological and staining characters. 2. Against a positive Br. abortus serum. 3. For the production of H2S 4. For growth on Huddleson's dye media 5. For agglutinin-absorption test 6. For pathogenicity to g. pigs. 1. Morphologcial and staining characters. Culture smears were stained by Gram's method and examined. Gram negative, short and slender rods were observed. 2. Test against a positive Br. abortus serum. Suspensions of the organisms were made in 12 per cent saline which was 0.5 per cent carbolized and adjusted to Brown's opacity tube No. 1. These, together with the standard Br. abortus antigen, were put to agglutination test against stock Br. abortus anti-serum. Positive agglutination was observed in high dilutions of the serum in all the cases, thus proving that the strains under study belonged to the genus Brucella. 3. H2S production. The goat Brucella strains along with the known Br. abortus, Br. meletensis and Br. suis strains were subcultured on liver infusion agar slants. Strips of filter paper dipped in 10 per cent lead acetate solution and dried were inserted so that the free ends of the strips would hang inside the culture tubes just above the level of the media. The tubes were then incubated at 37°C (10 per cent Co2 tension was used wherever necessary). The strips of indicator paper were changed daily and the date and the culture number marked on them. This process was repeated for seven days and on comparison with the known strains the goat strains of Brucella had produced

Further, it is probable that during the sixth week after kidding when the vaginal materials were collected, the vaginae might have ceased to function as the channel of elimination. Our success in isolating the organism from the milk would only indicate that during the period after kidding when the samples were collected the organisms had localized in the udder and were being eliminated through the milk. Where the blood serum response is positive in a high titre, the evidence of infection by Brucella organisms may be considered as irrefutable, although it might not be possible to demonstrate in every such case the organism by cultural examination. In view of the isolation of Br. abortus from milk samples of goats of a farm subjected to frequent epidemics or endemics of goat abortion, the question arises as to the possible relationship of the in- fection to cattle of the farm and vice versa. Although cattle abortion had been occuring in this farm, it never assumed the same seriousness as amongst the goats and as such, no investigation on the incidence of the disease amongst the bovines was called for. From a few trickles of abortion that have been reported, the organisms isolated were reported to conform to Br. abortus-meletensis type. The goats from which Br. abortus was isolated in of the present investigation were purchased from some adjoining district and being kept separate from the bovine herd, chances of infection being acquired by them from cattle could, therefore, be considered remote. Strict isolation of these two herds may also account for the disease being localized amongst the goats only. SUMMARY 1. Brucellosis amongst goats at the Government Livestock Farm, Hissar was investigated by blood serum agglutination test and by cultural examination and g. pig inoculation of infective materials including milk of some normally kidded goats. 2. From a few serum-positive goats, Br. abortus (Bang) was isolated by milk samples inoculated into g. pigs. The essential criteria used in the differentiation of the genus Brucella were tested in the present work of typing this organism.

INFECTIVITY BY CONTACT OF RINDERPEST VIRUS, INCLUDING GOAT- ADAPTED VIRUS, FOR CATTLE AND GOATS* By C. SEETHARAMAN, B.Sc, B.V.Sc, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar-Kumaun (Received for publication on 3 February 1948) (With four text figures) EDWARDS [1927] succeeded in implanting virulent rinderpest bull virus in goats by passing it through the foetal membranes of pregnant animals. In this way, a goat-adapted rinderpest virus was elaborated which, while retaining its specific pathogenicity for goats, was of value for protect- ing cattle and which is in use for this purpose in India up to the present time. This weakened virus, produces in Indian cattle only a mild thermal reaction but the immunity is serviceable and lasting, and under experimental conditions at Mukteswar has been proved to endure for some ten years. After extensive use of this product for nearly twenty years, both in free areas and in the face of out- breaks, almost no adverse comment has arisen as to its value and safety. On the other hand, im- ported cattle, water buffaloes, cattle of pure-bred progeny, and native cattle with an admixture of foreign blood tend to show a more severe thermal reaction and other ill effects. To control such undesirable reactions it is well known to be sufficient to inject at the same time a small quantity of rinderpest immune serum, say 10 to 40 c.c. per 100 lb. body weight. This serum-simultaneous method using goat-virus has also been adopted with satisfactory results, both under laboratory and field conditions [Bawa, 1940] for protecting sheep and goats against rinderpest. During the past twenty years the general observation has been made that the use of goat-virus produces centres of infection neither in native cattle nor in more susceptible cattle. Experiments in the same connection have been made, both at Mukteswar and in the field, to determine whether cattle undergoing vaccination with the modified virus are infectious for healthy cattle and goats by contact. As a result, it seems evident that under what may be called ordinary conditions of contact transmission does not occur. However, it still remained to be ascertained whether transmission might occur under conditions, some of them admittedly rather artificial, which would enhance the chances of transfer. The results of experiments in this light are reported here. EXPERIMENTAL The strains of virus used were (i) a virulent bull virus, designated Line 'E' This virus is highly pathogenic for hill bulls and causes a mortality of 95 per cent. (ii) a goat-adapted virus, designated Line 'W', which is maintained at this Institute for supplying goat spleen tissue to the field for immu- nization work. Representative temperature charts of these viruses in bulls and goats are given in Figs. 1 to 4. The animals used in the experiments were goats and Kumauni hilll bulls. The latter according to Edwards, are 18 times as susceptible to rinderpest as plains cattle. The goats were brought from the plains and the goat-modified virus has a specific pathogenicity for these animals. To represent various degrees of contact that are possible under ordinary field conditions, ex- periments were made as follows : (i) In a cattle shed. This was of the double row type, 50 × 20 feet, in which the animals are tied facing away from one another. At each end there are two doorways, between which runs a central passage, three feet wide. The house has no separate feeding passages and is divided into stalls, six feet wide. For ventilation there are skylights in the roof and three windows in each of the long walls. In this experiment two animals were tied in the one stall, the windows were always closed and doors opened except at night. (ii) In a chappar, where still closer contact between healthy and infected was possible. This was really a small room, 10 feet square, and about large enough to accommodate two hill *Paper read at the Indian Science Congress 1948, 69 B

In the stall where the virus producers are accommodated, it was arranged that two healthy goats and one hill bull should be kept and that these animals should remain in contact with not less than ten conse- cutive batches of virus producers. The temperatures of the experimental animals were not taken so as to avoid any chance of mechanical transmission. Three weeks later the two goats and the bull were proved to be susceptible to rinderpest on being tested with goat virus and bull virus res- pectively. B2

A healthy bull was inoculated with the goat-adapted virus and accommodated in a stall of the shed described above. In the same stall were tied two goats and one hill bull so that there was appreciable contact between them. Although the inoculated bull reacted, the in-contact animals showed no rise in temperature and were later proved susceptible to rinderpest. 2. Chappar contact In the next attempt a chappar was used.

The inoculated goats died nine and ten days after inoculation. The in-contact goats and bull showed no signs of infection. After three weeks they were tested with line 'W and line 'E' virus respectively, and shown to be still susceptible. (b) Bull as donor. A hill bull was inoculated with goat virus, and two goats and one. bull were allowed to remain in contact for a period of three weeks. Although the inoculated bull showed a thermal reaction, the in-contact animals showed no signs of infection and all proved susceptible to rinderpest.

On the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh days after inoculation, a healthy goat was exposed for six hours at a distance of three feet from it. Seven days after the last exposure the animal showed a thermal reaction (104.5°F.), and when tested three weeks later, proved to be immune. In another experiment a goat was inoculated with goat virus. On the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh days after inoculation a hill bull was exposed, for six hours and at three feet distance on each of these days. The goat died on the ninth day, but the bull remained unaffected and was later proved susceptible to rinderpest. (b) Bull as donor. Idnani [1944] has proved by the above method that transmission of rinderpest does not take place between a bull inoculated with goat virus and a healthy bull. To find out if by this method, a healthy goat will contract the disease from a bull inoculated with goat virus, a healthy goat was exposed to an infected bull daily from the third to seventh days for a period of six hours at a distance of three feet. The experimental animal remained unaffected and later proved susceptible.
74 Infectivity by contact of Rinderpest Virus Vol. XVIII, Part II EXPERIMENTS WITH VIRULENT BULL VIRUS To ascertain the infectivity of a more virulent rinderpest virus by contact from goat to bull, from goat to goat or from bull to goat, a set of experiments was carried out on the lines of work done with goat virus. 1. Shed contact (a) Goat as donor. Two goats were inoculated with line ' E ' virus. Two goats and one hill bull were placed in contact in the same stall. Although the inoculated animals showed a thermal reaction, the in-contact animals remained unaffected and three weeks later proved susceptible on test. (b) Bull as donor. Two goats and one bull were in contact in the same stall with one hill bull inoculated with line ' E ' virus. The inoculated animal showed typical reaction of rinderpest and died on the 11th day. The in-contact bull contracted the disease and later died of it, whereas the in-contact goats showed no reaction and were susceptible to rinderpest on test. 2. Chappar contact (a) Goat as donor. Two goats were inoculated with line ' E ' virus and kept with two healthy goats and one hill bull. Both inoculated goats showed a thermal reaction and one of them died on the 12th day. All the in-contact animals showed a thermal reaction from the seventh day. The bull died of rinderpest on the 14th day, one goat died on the 11th day and the other goat survived. (b) Bull as donor. Two goats and one hill bull were allowed to remain in contact with one hill bull inoculated with line ' E ' virus. The inoculated animal showed typical reactions of rinderpest and died on the 11th day. But the in-contact goats did not contract the infection and later proved susceptible on test with goat virus. The in-contact bull contracted the disease and died. 3. Trevis contact (a) Goat as donor. A goat inoculated with line ' E ' virus was exposed to a healthy goat for six hours daily from the third to seventh day, separated by a distance of three feet. In another experiment under similar conditions a bull was exposed. The experimental goat contracted the dis- ease and died. The bull showed no signs of infection and later proved susceptible on test. (b) Bull as donor. Experiments done by Idnani have proved that transmission of rinderpest by expired air from an infected bull to a healthy one is possible. To ascertain if a goat would contract the infection under similar conditions, a bull was inoculated with line ' E ' virus and a goat exposed to it from the third to seventh day daily for six hours, the distance between the animals being three feet. The experimental animal remained unaffected and after three weeks proved susceptible to rinderpest.

SEETHARAMAN 75 In the tabular summary, the results of transmission experiments described in this paper using the goat-adapted virus (W) and the virulent virus (E) are as follows : TABLE I Results of transmission experiments Strain of virus Animal inoculated Animal exposed Results Shed Chappar Trevis Line 'W' . . .

Goat . . . . 76 Infectivity by contact of Rinderpest Virus Vol. XVIII, Part II use of goat virus may have been responsible for establishing a certain form of epizootic in goats and that this in turn may have been responsible for the spread of a form of rinderpest in cattle. The results of the transmission experiments described in this article, with both the virulent and the goat- adapted rinderpest virus, suggest, however, that when epizootics occur in goats it is most unlikely that they originate from the use of goat virus vaccine. It is well known that outbreaks of rinderpest do occur in goats, but in the light of all the evidence one can only conclude that they are due to the natural virus, probably from cattle. How frequently such outbreaks actually occur in sheep and goats cannot be stated, because the diagnosis of rinderpest in sheep and goats, apart from laboratory procedures, is rather difficult, the symptoms according to Orr [1945] being not unlike those seen in other common diseases in these animals. The possibility of rinderpest virus from natural outbreaks in sheep and goats producing rinderpest in cattle is one which requires investigation. The results of the present experiment suggest that, in general the chances of transmission will depend on the nature of the virus, its virulence and environmental conditions in which goats and cattle happen to be accommodated. In any case, an early diagnosis of rinderpest in goats would be desirable, so that opportunity for its dissemination may be impeded. SUMMARY 1. The possibility of goats or cattle undergoing vaccination with the goat-modified rinderpest virus spreading the infection to goats or cattle kept in the same shed has been tested. The experiments have given negative results. Under ordinary field conditions, therefore, there appears to be no danger of spread of the disease occurring through this cause. 2. Under artificial conditions of very close contact, as when healthy animals are compelled to breathe the expired air of infected ones, transmission is possible. Important factors here are the virulence of the virus and the degree of exposure in terms of time and distance between the animals. C ACKNOWLEDGEMENT My thanks are due to Dr F. C.

NASAL CARRIERS IN BOVINE PASTEURELLOSIS By NAGIA SINGH, Research Scholar Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (U.P.), India (Received for publication on 23 December 1947) THE older view that in nature Pasteurellosis results from the ingestion of Pasteurella-septica leading a saprophytic existence in the outer world is no longer tenable. To explain the spread of the disease transmission by vectors had been postulated. Thus Magnusson [1914] suggested that some sucking insect was responsible for a large epidemic which occurred among reindeer in Sweden. Daubney, Hudson and Roberts [1934] adduced some evidence that the disease in cattle could be carried by the flea, Ctenocephalus-felis-bouche. This was supported by Mehra [1941-1943] who suc- ceeded in transmitting the disease in rabbits and in large animals through the agency of the same flea. This matter has been investigated by Sapre [1945] with some thoroughness. Using a highly virulent strain of Pasteurella he has found that while fleas can transmit the disease with ease in rabbits, such transmission failed or sometimes occurred only with the greatest difficulty in young water buffaloes which are highly susceptible in nature. At the present time it is considered with much justification that in all probability respiratory carriers are responsible for maintaining and spreading pasteure- llosis in cattle or as it is still termed, haemorrhagic septicaemia. The same is true of swine [Uhlenhuth and Haendel 1913]. In the case of rabbits, Dekruif [1921, 1922a, b, 1923] observed Pasteurella orga- nisms in the nose of a large proportion of apparently normal animals living in association with rabbits suffering from snuffles. Webster [1924a, b] found that preceding an outbreak of rabbits Pasteurallosis there was a rise in the normal carrier rate and that the susceptibility of rabbits varried greatly, some being highly resistant, others succumbing with ease. With fowls, Pritchett, Beaudette and Hughes [1930], showed that 11 per cent of healthy birds acted as carriers and that it was from such birds that the organisims spread and gave rise during the winter months to the various forms of infections viz., carriers, localized upper respiratory disease and typical fowl cholera. Hughes and Pritchett [1930] showed that Past. septica was incapable of inciting fowl cholera when introduced directly into the alimentary tract, but could produce the typical disease when administered into the upper respiratory passages. Jorgenson [1925] found that in cattle a considerable proportion of normal animals (about 15 per cent) carried Past. septica in the upper respiratory tract. All such observations suggest that natural infection occurs through the nose and is dependant on the presence of carriers. The present work was undertaken in order to ascertain the proportion of Pasteurella carriers in selected groups of cattle and buffaloes. In all, the nasal passages of 300 animals were swabbed, viz., 100 slaughtered animals at the abattoir and 200 live animals in areas in the United Provinces where Pasteurellosis prevails. The animals examined were mainly young buffaloes. Of the dead animals, 7 per cent were found to be pasteurella carriers while the carrier percentages among live animals were: Area No. examined Carriers per cent 1 60 5.0 2 60 3.3 3 80 3.75 EXPERIMENTAL The swabs were made of copper wire 46 cms. long with a cotton wool binding at one end. This was placed within a shorter rubber tube of 0.6 to 1.0 cm. internal diameter, so that the wool binding lay near one end. Both ends of the rubber tube were then plugged and the whole outfit sterilized. For swabbing the nasal chamber, wet swabs soaked either in sterile normal saline or in sterile broth 77 C
78 Nasal Carriers in Bovine Pasteurellosis. [Vol. XVIII, Part II were used. Dry swabs did not give satisfactory results. In taking the swab, the wool plugged rubber tube was passed into the nostril through the nares in the live animals and through the oesaphagus or after splitting the head in the dead one, the plug pushed out, the mucous membrane rubbed, the wire pushed back into the lumen of the rubber tube before withdrawing the whole outfit from the nose. Swabs taken from animals at long distances from the laboratory were emulsified in broth at the spot, material taken to the laboratory, incubated for six hours and then plated out. Swabs taken from animals near the laboratory were directly streaked either on blood agar or on serum agar plates which were previously partially dried in the incubator. The plates were then incubated for twenty- four hours when they were searched for colonies like those of Past. septica viz., round, low convex with smooth glistening surface and entire edge. Among other organisms often met with on plates were staphylococci, gram-negative diplococci, haemolytic and non-haemolytic streptococci. Sus- picious colonies were fished to blood agar slants for further examination. Any organisms which were then found morphologically similar to Pasteurella were further studied for fermentation and other characters. Tests were made in 1 per cent dextrose, lactose, maltose, sucrose, mannite and salicine, also for indole and hydrogen-sulphide production, in litmus milk, for gelatin liquifaction, V. P. and M. R. reactions. Cultures conforming to Pasteurella were retained for agglutination and patho- genicity tests. Results In Table I are shown the reactions of 15 Pasteurella strains isolated from dead and living animals. TABLE I Reactions of different Pasteurella Strains Ser.

Abbattoir A June 1948] NAGINA SINGH 79 All the above strains when subjected to M. R., V. P., litmus milk and gelatin liquifaction reactions proved negative, but they all produced indol and hydrogen sulphide. Agglutination The serum dilutions ranged from 1 : 50 to 1 : 3200 and some times higher. Tubes were placed in water bath at 55°C for 2-4 hours or in dry incubator at 37°C for 24 hours. A positive test serum was prepared by injecting rabbits at 4-7 days intervals with increasing amounts of 0.4 per cent formalized culture of highly virulent typical Past. septica. Seven injections were given, animals were bled seven days after the last injection and serum was preserved with 0.5 per cent phenol. Antigens were pre- pared from the 15 strains described in Table I by washing off 24 hours agar cultures and diluting to a density between 1 and 2 (Brown's opacity standard). An experiment with the 15 strains showed that where agglutination occurred, there was no di- fference in the titre between live and dead Pasteurella antigens. Hence for routine agglutination tests, heat killed antigens preserved with 0.25 per cent chloroform have been used. It was also noted that four of the 15 strains, Nos. 4, 7, 8 and 9 failed to show any agglutination, but nearly all the rest reached a titre of 3200 to 6400. This result was not unexpected in view of the previous work. Cornelius [1929] working with 26 Pasteurella strains showed that these varried widely in agglutinibility and that not infrequently strains would become temporarily inagglutinable. He found that infection by a particular serological type was not confined to a particular species of animals. He fitted 17 of the strains into four groups but there was no relationship between serological grou- ping and the animal species of origion. Yusef [1935] classified 14 out of 21 strains into three sero- logical groups. Pathogenicity Tests were made in rabbits by injecting intramuscularly 0.0001 c.c. of 18 hours broth culture. The rabbits were of roughly the same weight and were kept under observation for a week. The results are shown in Table II.

80 Nasal Carriers in Bovine Pasteurellosis [Vol. XVIII, Part I The results show that 12 of the 15 strains were virulent for rabbits although they were not standard virulence. Pasteurella was recovered from the heart blood and internal organs of rabbi that succumbed. DISCUSSION The proportion of carriers detected in this work probably greatly under estimates the incidence in nature. For one reason the nasal passages in bovines are very long and it is very difficult to reach their remote parts so that in many animals swabbing is incomplete or otherwise unsatisfactory. Secondly the nasal mucous membrane is very sensitive and the irritation often causes much struggling Correspondingly the carrier incidence determined in animals after death was somewhat highe viz., 7 per cent compared with 4 per cent in living ones. SUMMARY 1. Fifteen strains of Past. septica were isolated from nasal swabs taken from 300 cattle, mostly young buffaloes. One hundred were from freshly slaughtered animals at the abattoir while the re- maining were from live cattle in regions where Pasteurellosis is not uncommon. Among the dead animals the carrier incidence was 7 per cent and in the living one 3.5 per cent. These percentages are probably under-estimates. 2. The strains were similar in being non-motile, non-gas-producing, fermenting dextrose, sucrose and mannite but not fermenting lactose and salicine, and producing indole and hydrogen-sulphide. 3. Four of the 15 strains were not agglutinated by serum prepared with a standard laboratory strain of high virulence. Twelve of the 15 were pathogenic for rabbits.

THE NUTRITIVE VALUE OF MAIZE HUSK By D. G. PANDITTESEKERE, S. C. RAY AND N. D. KEHAR, Animal Nutrition Section, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (RECEIVED FOR PUBLICATION ON 25 NOVEMBER 1947) OWING to the increasing demand in recent years for industrial starch, a number of factories in different parts of the country are manufacturing it from maize, with maize-husk or bran and maize-oil cake as by-products. In the United Kingdom and United States of America these by- products are used for stock feeding. The starch manufacture in this country should thus yield two valuable cattle feeds. Through the courtesy of Messrs Govan Bros., Rampur (United Provinces) one lot, each of maize- husk and maize-oil cake were received for investigations into their nutritive value. ORIGIN OF THE BY-PRODUCT It is understood from the manufacturers that miaze-husk is obtained in the course of starch manufacture as follows: The maize, as received, is cleaned in a maize cleaner. The grain is then softened by soaking in water slightly acidified with sulphurous acid. The softening requires several days after which the maize kernels are torn apart in crushing mills so as to liberate the germs. The material is then mixed with water and passed into tanks where the germs, which owing to their oil content are lighter, rise to the surface and are removed. The residue is finely ground and strained in stages through silk sieves there by separating husk from the starchmilk. The husk is then pre-dried through a roller mill and thereafter dried by steam driers and finally bagged. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF MAIZE HUSK In Table I is shown the chemical compositions of maize husk, corn bran82 Nutritive Value of Maize Husk [Vol. XVIII, Part I] wheat bran but much lower than that of rice-bran. The husk contains nearly the same amount of crude fibre as the brans but is significantly richer in nitrogen free extract, being twice as rich as rice- bran. The figures for calcium and phosphorus in the two samples of brans are not available, but from data of other samples [Sen, 1946] it is apparent that, unlike the husk, the two brans are rich sources of phosphorus, though their calcium content is definitely poorer than that of the husk. METABOLISM OF MAIZE-HUSK For reasons stated later, this investigation had to be carried out in two experiments : EXPERIMENT I The object was to study the maximum quantity of maize-husk taken by cattle when given free access to it, and with maximum consumption of husk and wheat-bhoosa fed ad lib to determine (a) the digestibility coefficient of the whole ration as well as of maize-husk and (b) nitrogen calcium and phosphorus balances. Four adult healthy kumauni bullocks of average live weight of 300 lb. were selected for experiment. In a preliminary trial, an attempt was made to assess the maximum quantity of the husk the animals would consume. They seemed to relish the stuff and the daily consumption varied between 4 to 5 lb. per animal. In the course of about a week, however, con- sumption gradually fell. The method of feeding was then changed by mixing finely ground common salt with the husk. This improved the consumption and just before the experimental trial it was stabilized at about 3.5 lb. During the trial each animal was given 4 lb. of the husk mixed with one ounce of common salt, the residue left over was weighed and recorded. After the consumption of the husk, which was placed before the animals at 9.30 a.m. and the residue removed after about 3 hours, weighed quantity of wheat-bhoosa in excess of the actual requirement was offered. A record was also maintained of the residue left of the wheat-bhoosa. This ration was fed for a preparatory period of 15 days, after which 24 hourly collections were made of excreta for 10 days to determine the digestibility and balances of nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus. During the feeding trial, the animals were frequently weighed. The weight at the end of the trial revealed that all the animals suffered a mean loss of weight of 7 lb. Food consumption. In Table II is given the consumption on dry basis of individual items of the ration per head per day, as also the total dry matter consumption per 100 lb. live weight. The data in Table II show that the average daily consumption of maize husk in three out of four animals was a little over 1400 gms. in one animal it was slightly less than 1200 gms. The daily consumption, when averaged for the four animals works out at 1354.6 gms. maize husk per animal per day. This high intake of husk supplemented simply by common salt seemed to have seriously affected the con- sumption of wheat-bhoosa which was as low as 66.8 gms. per animal per day. The lowered intake of roughage was reflected in the total dry matter consumption per 100 lb. live weight. Considering that the average capacity of consumption of dry matter, under maintenance condition of an adult, should ordinarily approximate 900 gms. per 100 lb. live weight, the average intake of 672.8 gms. dry matter indicates that the actual consumption is about 25 per cent below the expected normal. It would be of interest to trace the reasons for this depression in intake when the feeds were offered freely. One of the possible factors limiting the optimum intake may be the physical effect of swelling which maize-husk may undergo in the rumen. But perhaps a more potent factor is the unusually low phosphorus content of the husk. It is well known that one of the earliest physiological distur- bances produced by phosphorus deficiency is depression in appetite [Tjeiler and Green, 1932]. The data presented later seem to justify this contention. RESULTS OF METABOLISM TRIALS In Tables III and IV are detailed the composition of the feeding stuff used in the experiment and the consumption and excretion of various nutrients and their digestibility coefficients. The balances of nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus are shown in Table V. The significance of these data on metabolism will be discussed later.

KEHAR 89 DISCUSSION ON RESULTS OF COMPARATIVE METABOLISM TRIALS IN EXPERIMENTS I AND II Digestibility Co-efficient. The introduction of a small quantity of linseed-cake into the ration had a profound effect on dry matter consumption and the digestibility of the whole ration, as also of maize-husk determined by process of elimination. The average digestibility co-efficient data summarized in Table X, show that the inclusion of the cake has improved the digestibility of crude protein and ether extract of the whole ration; the carbohydrates moiety being relatively little in- fluenced. The effect seems to be much pronounced in the case of maize-husk, all the constituents of which have shown significantly higher digestibility in experiment II.

G. PANDITTESEKERE, S. C. RAY AND N. D. KEHAR 91 and rice. The data show that in available protein, the husk is relatively poorer than either wheat or rice bran, but in energy moiety it is somewhat richer than either of the by-products. SUMMARY Maize-husk or maize bran, apart from its total carbohydrates, is inferior in chemical make-up to wheat or rice bran. Contrary to other brans it is also extremely poor in phosphorus which is as low as 0.09 per cent. When maize-husk is fed in a simple combination with wheat-bhoosa, the total dry matter con- sumption becomes sub-optimal, digestibility is depressed and balances of N, Ca and P are negative. This nutritional defect is corrected if the ration is supplemented by linseed-cake to an extent approxi- mately one fifth of the maize-husk intake. Under balanced feeding the digestibility co-efficient of maize-husk works out to be: crude protein 55, ether extract 53 and total carbohydrates 79. Based on these co-efficients, the nutritive value has been calculated as 4.09 lb., 59.1 lb. and 67.9 lb. digestible crude protein, starch equivalent and total digestible nutrients respectively per 100 lb. of the material.

UTILIZATION OF BY-PRODUCTS OF STARCH MANUFACTURE FROM MAIZE AS CATTLE FEEDS II. THE NUTRITIVE VALUE OF MAIZE-OIL CAKE By D. G. PANDITTESEKERE, S. C. RAY, N. D. KEHAR, Animal Nutrition Section, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 25 November 1947) IN Part I the authors [1946] described how the germs are separated from the kernels in the manu- facture of starch from maize. To prepare maize-oil cake the germs are collected on metal sieves, dried first in roller mills and then in rotary steam driers after which the oil is expelled by oil expellers; the solid material left after oil extraction is the cake. In this paper are presented the results of investigations on the nutritive value of maize-oil cake. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF MAIZE-OIL CAKE. In Table I are given data as to percentage composition on dry basis of important organic and inorganic constituents of the cake. For comparison, similar figures are given for other oil-cakes commonly used in this country. It is seen that in its organic constituents, maize-oil cake is com- parable with cocoanut-cake; while its inorganic constituents are more like those of groundnut cake. The ether extract content of 14.97 per cent is rather high for an oilcake used for feeding livestock. However, in view of the fact that cotton seed with an ether extract of 20.6 per cent [Sen, 1946] is tolerated and extensively fed to milch stock in certain parts of the country [Patel, Patel and Dave, 1944], the oil in the maize cake is unlikely to have an untoward effect on nutrition. The crude protein content is similar to that of cocoanut cake but lower than of other cakes. Of the cakes compared maize cake has the highest value for nitrogen-free extract which is also reflected in the value for the total carbohydrates. The richness in this constituent is natural in a by-product from a cereal, like maize. It is, however, poor in calcium and phosphorus and is the lowest in the group except ground- nut cake.

K. TALAPATRA, S. C. RAY and K. C. SEN, Indian Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 24 November 1947) IN majority of the methods published on the estimation of oxalic acid in biological materials [Dakin, 1907, Arbenz, 1917, Nelson and Mottern, 1931, Pucher et al, 1934, and Kohman, 1939], the principle involved is to release the acid free from its combination of a salt by treating the sample with a mineral acid. The free acid is then extracted with ether and from the ethereal extract, oxalic acid is precipitated as its calcium salt and finally estimated by permanganate titration. Some of these ether-extraction methods published on or before 1931 have been found not sufficiently accurate. Incomplete extraction of oxalic acid and the lack of proper control in its precipitation from the ethereal extract are factors responsible for inaccuarcy in estimation. In later methods, particularly in that of Pucher et al cited above, these limitations have been successfully overcome and accurate and reproducible values have been obtained. The accuracy in estimation, however, is achieved only after introducing laborious and complicated modifications in the technique which are unsatisfactory for routine work involving at one time a large number of analyses. The ether-extraction method, moreover, offers a difficulty of considerable magnitude under the Indian conditions. In summer months, the complete extraction of oxalic acid by ether proves to be an impossible operation. Not only large amount of ether is wasted, but due also to much reduced number of syphoning, the extrac- tion period has to be prolonged indefinitely and even then, uniformly satisfactory extraction cannot be made. Majumdar and De [1938] have attempted to simplify the extraction method by excluding the use of ether. Because of its simplicity, the method was given careful and repeated trials in this laboratory. These trials had however, shown that with biological materials, such as, cattle feeds, fodders and faeces, the method was unworkable. Further, in connection with some metabolism studies reported elsewhere [Talapatra, Ray and Sen, 1947], it was found essential to know the relative proportions of 'soluble' and ' insoluble ' forms of oxalicacid occurring in oxalate-rich feeding stuffs. In the published literature there is no reference in which an attempt has been made to partition the oxalic acid of a food or other biological sample. In view of the limitations in existing methods, and as none has scope in carrying out the partition a new method with the necessary advantage has been evolved. A part of the work reported in this paper was published in an abridged form by Talapatra et al [1942]; in the present communication the full details are being given and additional information regarding oxalic acid content in Indian feeding stuffs, its variation with the progressive maturity of the plant and its distribution in leaf and stem are also being included. General principle of the new method. Depending upon the nature of the biological sample, it is first boiled in distilled water or in 1 per cent solution of caustic soda for half hour. Sufficient con- centrated sodium carbonate solution is then added to make the final strength approximately 4 per cent and the boiling is continued for another half hour. During these two cooking processes, the following changes are effected; (a) the cellular tissues are completely broken down, (b) fatty matters are saponified and (c) by a process of metathesis, all insoluble oxalate salts are converted into soluble sodium oxalate. The liquid extract is then filtered and residue washed with hot water till the wash water does not show any alkaline reaction. The combined filtrate and wash water is then con- centrated to a small volume and allowed to cool. In the cold, with constant stirring, hydrochloric acid (1:1) is added drop by drop till the final acid concentration after the neutralization of the alkali becomes approximately one per cent. At this stage, a heavy precipitate of extraneous matter appears which is allowed to flocculate. The extract is then carefully filtered. In the clear lightly coloured filtrate, oxalic acid is precipitated as its calcium salt and is determined in the usual way. 99 H
100 New Method of Estimation of Oxalic Acid [Vol. XVIII, Part II, Details of technique. The biological material, such as a feeding stuff, is first dried and then finely powdered in a milling machine. A quantity varying from 2 to 5 grams of the powdered sample is taken in a 600 c.c. tall-form pyrex beaker and 40 c.c. of distilled water added. The beaker with its content is then placed over a sand bath, the top of the beaker being covered by a suitable round bottom flask filled with cold water to act as a condenser. As soon as the content in the beaker start boiling, it is given a thorough shaking and the boiling is allowed to continue for another half hour. At the end of this period keeping the beaker in the sand bath, 10 c.c. of a 20 per cent solution of sodium carbonate is added. The content of the beaker is thoroughly stirred with a rubber capped glass rod which is then washed in the beaker. The water in the condensing flask is also changed with fresh cool water. The cooking is then continued for another half hour. During the interval, the contents in the beaker are occasionally shaken without removing the condenser flask at the top. When the cooking is over, the content is filtered hot by suction through a disc of cloth (65 threads to an inch) fitted to a 7 c.c. Buchner funnel. The residue on the cloth is washed with hot water until the wash water does not show any alkaline reaction. The filtrate is quantitatively transferred back to the original beaker and boiled down to 100 to 150 c.c. It is allowed to cool, and then enough hydrochloric acid (1:1) is added drop by drop and with constant stirring until the final acid con- centration becomes approximately one per cent. At this stage a flocculent precipitate appears and the whole thing after vigorous stirring is transferred quantitatively into a 200 c.c. volumetric flask and the volume is made up to the mark. The precipitate in the flask is allowed to settle and the clear supernatant liquid is filtered off through a fluted filter paper. An aliquot of the filtrate is taken in a 400 c.c. beaker, diluted with water to 200 c.c. and then made just ammonical and reacidified with acetic acid. In the cold medium is added 10 c.c. of a 10 per cent solution of calcium chloride and the mixture is stirred well to induce the precipitate of calcium oxalate to appear. The preci- pitate is allowed to settle overnight. The clear supernatant liquid is carefully decanted off through a Whatman No. 42 filter paper leaving as much of the precipitate as possible undisturbed. The precipitate is then dissolved in hydrochloric acid (1:1) after first allowing a few c.c. of the acid to pass through the filter paper and collecting it in the beaker containing the precipitate. From the hydrochloric acid solution, oxalic acid is reprecipitated and, this time, from a hot solution. The second precipitation is necessary because, in the first, some colouring matter is liable to be dragged along with the calcium oxalate precipitate which in subsequent titration with standard permanganate is likely to introduce an error. The final calcium oxalate precipitate is dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid and then titrated with 0.05 N potassium permanganate solution. One c.c. of 0.05 N permanganate solution is equivalent to 0.00225 gram anhydrous oxalic acid. All figures of oxalic acid shown in this paper are expressed in the anhydrous form. Estimation of oxalic acid in cattle faeces. Since cattle faeces contain relatively large amount of silica, it is necessary that this should be removed before oxalic acid is precipitated by calcium chloride. Besides this additional step, the slight modification in the method required for the purpose may be described as follows: 5 grams of the dried and finely ground sample of faeces are first cooked in 40 c.c. of one per cent solution of caustic soda for half hour which is followed by another half hour cooking with the sodium carbonate solution. After the cooking is over, the extract is separated by filtration through a disc of 7 c.m. Whatman No. 1 filter paper fitted to a Buchner funnel. The extract is boiled down to about 50 c.c. and allowed to cool. In the cold extract, enough hydrochloric acid (1:1) is added to make the final acid concentration one per cent. The precipitate formed is filtered off. A suitable volume of the filtrate is taken in a graduated flask and just sufficient ammonia added to make it alkaline. The volume is made upto the mark with distilled water and the content of the flask is thoroughly shaken. The silicic acid precipitate is filtered off and in an aliquot of the filtrate, oxalic acid is determined. Estimation of water soluble oxalates. The obvious use of water for the extraction purpose is precluded by the fact that free organic acids are liberated from the plant material if cooking is carried out with water alone. The liberated acids are liable to act on some of the salts of calcium and magne- sium and the cation thus set free will combine with soluble oxalates to form insoluble salts. The
June 1948.] S. K. TALAPATRA, S. C. BAY AND K. C. SEN 101 extraction is therefore carried out with an ammonical solution so as to prevent the formation of free acids. The details of extraction consist of as follows: A suitable quantity, 2 to 5 grams, of finely ground sample is boiled with an ammonical solution (1:10) under reflux for one hour. At the end of the period, the reflux is removed and the boiling is continued for another 15 minutes. The content is cooled and diluted with distilled water to make the extract approximately 200 c.c. After a thorough shaking, the content is allowed to rest so that the solid may settle at the bottom. The supernatant liquid is then filtered through a quantitative filter paper to eliminate the possibility of fine crystals of insoluble oxalate passing into the filtrate. The rest of the procedure is the same as described for the total oxalate estimation. EXPERIMENTAL TRIALS In establishing the method as described above, the fulfilment of the following conditions is essential: (a) The conversion of insoluble oxalates into soluble oxalates by metathesis with sodium carbonate should be quantitative. (b) The cooking processes should guarantee complete extraction of salts of oxalic acid from biological materials. (c) The method should yield reproducible values and effect the desired recoveries of the added pure salts of oxalate. The conversion of insoluble oxalate into soluble oxalate. The insoluble oxalates in biological sample occur mainly as calcium oxalate. In small quantities, oxalates of other alkaline earth metals and perhaps in some cases micro quantities of manganese oxalate may also occur. To test the completeness of metathesis, a pure salt of calcium oxalate monohydrate (C2O4Ca, H2O) was prepared in the laboratory. Duplicate weighings of the salt were directly titrated with 0.1N. permanganate solution after dissolving in dilute sulphuric acid. Another set of four duplicate weighings of this salt were first boiled with 4 per cent solution of sodium carbonate for 5, 10, 20 and 30 minutes res- pectively. The precipitate of calcium carbonate formed in an excess of sodium carbonate solution according to the equation C2O4Ca+Na2CO3=CaCO3+Na2C2O4 was filtered off and washed. The mixture of the combined filtrate and wash water was then titrated in the usual way with the standard permanganate solution. The amounts of permanganate solution required in the cases where no metathesis was carried and those where the expedient was used are shown in Table I. It is apparent from the data presented above, that the estimated value is slightly higher than the calculated value but well within the experimental error. It may also be noted that the complete metathesis is brought about within such a short period as 5 minutes inspite of the fact that the quantities of calcium oxalate taken are much in excess of what can be expected in a biological sample. Similar results were also obtained when oxalates of magnesium, barium and manganese were tested. The extraction of oxalates in biological samples. To determine the minimum time required for complete extraction of oxalates, a sample of finely ground paddy straw was taken. Three to five grams of the sample were first cooked in water for half hour, followed by second cooking in sodium carbonate solution for 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes according to the technique described. The values of oxalic acid estimated from the extracts obtained from the different periods of cooking in sodium carbonate solution are given in Table II. The data in Table II, show that there is practically no difference in the value of oxalic acid estimated in the extracts obtained between 15 minutes and 120 minutes of cooking. The closely similar values, moreover, suggest that the complete extraction of oxalates is assured if the digestion with sodium carbonate is fixed for half hour only. Various other biological samples such as, hays, straws from other cereals and millets, cattle faeces, etc., were also tried and the results were uniformly satisfactory. H2

It seems from the available analytical data that no survey has been carried out on the oxalic acid content in the feeds and fodders used for feeding live-stock. As farm animals are herbivorous and oxalic acid is known to occur in plant materials, the importance of this analytical study is obvious. By the method already described, a large number of feeding stuffs have been examined for their oxalic acid content and the results are shown in Table VI.

The effect of progressive maturity of fodders on oxalate content. It may be seen from the data in Table VII that early cut napier grass contains more oxalic acid than one cut at the ripe stage. Same is the case with guinea grass. Since these cultivated fodder plants are fed both at young and mature stages, a systematic study was carried out to determine their content at progressive stages of matu- rity. On the basis of theoretical interest, similar study with paddy plant was also included. Besides oxalic acid, nitrogen and some of the major minerals were analysed in the sample. The results of this study are given in Table VIII.

This decrease appears to be correlated with a similar fall in nitrogen content. If the figures for nitrogen is considered as the index of vegetative development, it can reasonably be assumed that the elaboration of the salts of oxalic acid is associated with the vegetative growth of the plant. Amongst the minerals, potassium alone seems to undergo similar change. Unlike that of paddy, the data on the analysis of napier and guinea grass show, that, with the progress from prime to efflorescent stage, the reduction of oxalic acid, nitrogen and potassium is relatively much more pronounced. In view of the fact that animals while eating often show preference for the leafy portion of a fodder, a study was made of the distribution of oxalic acid, nitrogen and minerals in leaf and stem of napier grass cut at different stages of maturity. The results are set out in Table IX.

But as the plant grows, the distribution is reversed and the difference in oxalic acid composition between the stem and the leaf becomes fairly wide. Nitrogen, as well as, calcium are higher in the leaf, whereas phosphorus is higher in the stem at all stages of growth. High phosphorus value in the stem appears to be a peculiarity of napier plant. SUMMARY 1. In view of the limitations in the applicability of the existing methods of estimation of oxalates in biological materials, a new method has been described which is simple, quick and accurate and also permits, with minor modification, the partitioning of total oxalates into soluble and insoluble forms. The method mainly consists in digesting the sample with a strong alkali carbonate solution which not only breaks the tissue cells, thereby releasing the encased salts, but simultaneously converts by a process of metathesis, all insoluble oxalates into soluble salts. The total oxalate is thus brought into the extract. The extract is then separated by filtration and treated in the cold with hydro- chloric acid to allow precipitation of the extraneous matters dissolved in the alkaline extract. The acid treated extract is filtered. In the filtrate, oxalate is precipitated by calcium chloride and finally estimated by the usual permanganate titration. 2. An analytical survey of the total oxalic acid content in commonly red Indian feeds and fodders shows that it is present from negligible to a very significant quantity in different feeding stuffs. Some fodders, such as, paddy straw, napier and guinea grass are rich in this substance. In oxalate-rich fodders, the salt is present both in soluble and insoluble forms. The soluble form, which occurs mainly as potassium oxalate, represents by far the major portion of the total oxalate. The total oxalic acid content in these fodders decreases with the progressive maturity of the plant. In napier grass, at the early stages of its growth, the oxalate content in the stem is higher than in the leaf. With the maturity, however, this distribution is reversed. The work described in this paper was carried out in the Animal Nutrition Section, Indian Veteri- nary Research Institute, Izatnagar. I

FERTILE eggs were incubated at a temperature between 37°-39°C and ten-day embryonated eggs were inoculated with 0.2 c.c. of a 10 per cent suspension of rinderpest calf spleen tissue in broth, the inoculum being dropped through a window cut in the egg shell over the region of the embryo. The window was sealed and the eggs incubated for three days and then opened for serial passages. The chorio-allantoic membrane and the amniotic membrane were removed aseptically and ground well with about 3 c.c. of the amnio-allantoic fluid; of this 0.2 c.c. was used for each passage. In this manner eleven serial passages were made. It was found that the virus was present in the membranes but not in the fluids and embryos. II. SERIAL passages were made by yolk sac inoculation as well as over the chorio-allantoic membrane. The authors observed that attenuation was more regular and uniform in virus passaged by yolk sac inoculation than in virus passaged by membrane inoculation. From the 67th onwards to the 71st passage the virus was found to be attenuated to a degree such that it could be safely used as a vaccinating agent, inoculated animals showing only a thermal reaction. Immunity was effective within 4 to 10 days. Vaccinated animals did not transmit infection to in-contact healthy animals. III. ANTISERA from chicks were obtained by inoculating intravenously the avianized rinderpest virus when the chicks were one day old and by bleeding the chicks 21 days later. The sera were tested in rabbits for neutralizing capacity against rabbit-adapted virus, the rabbits showing no thermal reaction if the virus was neutralized. Neutralization tests were successfully conducted and the chicks were good substitutes for calves when it was desired to determine either the presence of the avianized form of rinderpest virus or its concentration. IV. AMNIO-ALLANTOIC fluid collected from an infected egg constituted the antigen. Inactivations was achieved by heating the antigen at 60°C for one hour. By the use of this test the authors demonstrated complement-fixing antibodies in the sera of vaccinated animals from 14 days to 5 or 6 months after vaccination. (C.S.) MAX KLEIBER (1945).

110 Abstract [Vol. XVIII, Part II, The net utilization transfer of food energy to a form of energy useful to manJune 1948.] Abstract 111 rate in deficient beings can be raised by a provision of the vitamin in the diet. The in vitro paral- lelism between tissues from vitamin-deficient and cyanide-poisoned pigeons, indicates lack of respira- tory enzymesin vitamin B deficiency. Addition of vitamin B, or yeast extract raised the oxidation- rate of beriberi tissues. Polyneuritis has but a doubtful effect on tissue-metabolism. Riboflavin is involved in major normal oxidation processes. A lack of this constituent leads to a complex disturbance of coenzyme functions. Riboflavin deficiency per se has no marked effect on basal metabolism of rats. The limited in vitro study tilts in favour of the riboflavin deficiency lowering the oxidation rate. A diet, deficient in vitamin A or having an excess of it, does not significantly alter the metabolic rate. A reduced oxidation rate observed in in vitro studies with most of the tissues from the vitamin deficient rats points to the possible role of the vitamin in the oxidation of cells. Administration of vitamin D raises the metabolic rate and in keeping with this, the muscle from rats administered liberally with this vitamin has a higher rate of oxygen consumption in vitro. The skin from rachitic rats has a low oxidation rate in vitro. The major role of vitamin E has not yet been proved adequately. The vitamin is essential to the integrity of skeletal muscle and its deficiency leads to muscle dystrophy. The vitamin deficient rats exihibit a metabolic increase which can be lowered to the normal level by addition of wheat- germ oil or L-tocopherol to the deficient diet. Nevertheless, there is evidence to show that the notential metabolic increase in deficient rats is just counter-balanced by the opposite effects of a lowered food intake. In vitro studies on the dystrophic muscles of rabbits, guinea-pigs and rats support the view that the vitamin E deficiency increases the metabolic rate which is lowered by addition to the medium of L-tocopherol. A recent contradiction of this view needs elucidation. On account of the universality of their functions, as enzymes, hormones and antibodies, the protein deficiency lacks well-defined symptoms. The metabolic effects of a protein or a single amino- acid deficiency are not fully known. The view, that protein deficiency per se lowers the metabolic rate is based on meagre grounds. No data are available on the in vitro metabolism of tissues from protein deficient animals. However, it has been observed that addition of protein in any form to most of the tissues of normal animals increases the oxidation rate. It has been mentioned before that a low protien diet necessitates an increased oxidation of carbohydrates and fats. The loss of energy thus incurred is a homeostatic waste. Metabolic stimulation in most mineral deficiencies per se may also be due to homestatis. As in a normal animal the mineral concentration in the soft tissues remains nearly constant, the deficiencies can apparently be made up by destroying the muscles and hence there is the observed increase in the oxidation rate. Vitamin deficiencies in general do not affect or decrease the metabolic rate. Probably, the vitamins can considerably be squeezed out of the tissues without destroying them and so from an economic view point, the vitamin deficiencies need not be attended to as much of those of minerals.

Two further treat ments in persistent infections cured 80 per cent and this repeated in the reminder gave a 93 per cent cure. Nearly 95 per cent of the penicillin injected was absorbed from the udder tissue in about 12 hours but an effective concentration remained after this period if the dose was not less than 15,000 units. Treatment resulted in a transient fall in milk yield 13-37 per cent. The bacterial, and cell counts were practically nil within 12-24 hours of treatment. Staphylococcal infection was less amenable to treatment. Stress is laid on maintaining a high standard of shed hygiene and milking methods if the penicillin treatment is to prove effective. (II) Results are given of further trials with penicillin, treating six batches of 158 streptococcal and staphylococcal mastitis cases by udder infusion. A preliminary dose of 25,000 units of penicillin 100 c.c. normal saline followed by two doses of 5,000 units at 12 hourly intervals cured 71 per cent of clinical streptococcal mastitis cases. The percentage cure with three doses of 25,000 units in distilled water was 78 to 93 in clinical mastitis due to Str. agalactiae, 100 due to non-group B, streptococci and nil due to staphylococci. One single dose of 100,000 units in distilled water eliminated infection in 38 per cent of clinical mastitis due to Str. agalactiae, in 25 per cent due to streptococcus non-group B and in none due to staphylococcus. Three doses of 12,500 units in distilled water at 24 hour intervals eliminated infection in 71 per cent of clinical mastitis due to Str. agalactiae and in 17 per cent due to non-group B. streptococcus. Staphylococcal mastitis did not respond to treatment. Four doses of 25,000 units in distilled water were tried in treatment of 2 cases of clinical staphylococcal mastitis, without success. Three doses of 25,000 units in sterile peanut oil at 24 hour intervals proved efficacious in eliminating infection from 94 to 100 per cent cases of clinical mastitis due to Str. agalactiae but staphylococcal mastitis was not suppressed. It was observed that an effective concentration of penicillin within the udder for two-three days was more beneficial than a higher concentration for a shorter period. Although more than three doses enhanced the percentage cure, it was not economical for the farmer. Emphasis is laid on the inadequacy of penicillin alone in reducing the incidence of mastitis in commercial dairy herds, other factors, particularly hygienic, are of dominant importance. (M.M.S.)

June 1948.] Abstract 113 From the results of several tests this solution was found to have excellent possibilities for use as a spray in the control of cattle ticks. It was not poisonous and did not produce any irritation. For general eradication of ticks in an infested area each animal may be sprayed with 80 to 150 c.c. per head of the combined solution every 14 days. It effected a 85 to 99 per cent mortaility of ticks within 7 days after the application of the spray. If desired, the combined solution may be used with the same effect diluted with equal quantity of water. The solution could be applied on animals by use of hand or knap sack sprayers and power sprayers. It is economic and easier to apply and acts more rapidly in complete eradication of ticks than the control methods hitherto used in tropics. It averts danger of losses due to overheating, mechanical-injuries and poisoning. The D.D.T. rotenone combination is superior to the use of either ingredient alone. It works well under both dry and wet tropical conditions and even a continuous rainfall of eight hours following the applications of the spray did not reduce its efficacy very much. A fine penetrating spray was found most efficient and the results depended very much on the spray technique. The progressive killing action of the combined solution lasted as long as seven days. (P.B.M.) MGIPCRESEARCH INTO CONTAGIOUS ABORTION OF CATTLE, SHEEP, AND GOATS* BRUCELLOSIS IN INDIA By JOHN B. POLDING (Received for publication on 6 June 1947) INTRODUCTION THE scheme for the investigation of contagious abortion in the cattle, sheep and goats of India has occupied a period of five years, involved a considerable monetary expenditure and entailed some 25 thousand miles of travel, in persuing an enquiry throughout a subcontinent. Consequently, to avoid costly repetition and to preserve hardly won information, it seems that the results should be recorded as a single consecutive entity. In compiling this report, therefore, an attempt has been made to give a comprehensive, but concise, exposition of all that has been learnt during the scheme. Further, although some of the work has been partially or wholly described elsewhere116 Contagious Abortion of Cattle, Sheep and Goats [VOL. XVIII, PART III per annum. In special circumstances, however, major endemics are encountered and here the annual loss of calves may amount to 20 per cent of breeding stock during a period of several years; happily, such occurrences are again comparatively rare. Superimposed, or secondary, epidemics are not uncommon and in these, the loss of calves may amount to 5 to 15 per cent of breeding stock in the course of a few months. Continental survey, a general conspectus Fig. 12 gives an approximate representation of the geographical distribution of Brucellosis in India. Most of the organized farms of the country have been visited while from most of the remainder specimens have been sent to Mukteswar for examination and it has been found that, with very few exceptions, Indian farms are to a greater or lesser extent infected with Brucellosis. Further, as the majority of strains isolated from farms have proved to be the pure European type (Br. abortus) the source of a good part of the infection is attributable to the earlier stock, much of which originated in Europe. The actual appearance of Brucellosis in these farms, therefore, is of small epidemiological significance, for, its occurrence is largely fortuitous depending on where the farms happen to be and the character of their foundation stock. In the villages, on the other hand, the position is entirely different. Obviously, it has only been possible to visit a representative few rural areas in each province, but, nonetheless, discoveries in villages have been of far greater epidemiological interest than those in farms. If it is to be believed, for instance, that villages have become infected from farms, it would be reasonable to assume that most village infection would be found adjacent to farms. A glance at Fig. 12 shows that such is not the case, and indeed, village infection is commonest where farms are fewest and vice versa. More- over, as is shown on page 47 all Brucella strains, so far isolated from villages, differ in their typing characteristics from the Br. abortus strains isolated from farms. It would appear, therefore, that village infection, as seen almost exclusively on the Indian peninsula, has not been imported from Europe via the farms, but is an indigenous Indian infection, the distribution of which is of the highest epidemiological significance. Be that as it may, the distribution and persistence of a bacterial disease is chiefly concerned with microbial dissemination and, not until the section dealing with this subject is reached, can a hypothesis covering the peculiarities of epidemiology of the disease in village be preferred. In the meantime, a few remarks are necessary on some possible inaccuracies of village survey work. In a country of the utmost conservatism, where there are no laws giving power over live- stock, and where religion frequently forbids the drawing of bovine blood, to make a serological dia gnosis on privately owned animals is often impossible. It follows that village blood samples can only be obtained when the local veterinary staff are able to over-persuade the prejudices of the people. Furthermore, persuasion usually results in sick, rather than healthy, animals being produced and consequently cattle with some history of disease (in this case usually genital) are the ones most frequently bled. When, therefore, it is stated in the succeeding pages that say 45 per cent of animals tested were Brucella positive, this is not ordinarily a true percentage of all the stock of the village, but only of those more likely to be infected. Nevertheless, inaccurate though they may be, such records are the best obtainable and have been found by experience to reflect fairly exactly the apparent abortion rate in the villages concerned. As to the real abortion rate, in the absence of records, it is possible only to guess but where Brucella reactors are say upwards of 30 per cent, it is believed that abortion may occur at the rate of about 10 per cent per annum. The obtaining of blood samples from slaughter-houses is also often opposed, the chief trouble here being the dis- inclination of butchers to be put to the slightest inconvenience. However, the returns from tests of such samples are possibly only a very rough index of the prevalence of abortion in the surround- ing villages and so the loss of samples of this sort is annoying but hardly calamitous. Now it must be admitted at once that by far the largest number of village blood tests have been made in Madras, Orissa and the Central Provinces and Berar, or in other words in the very situa- tions where village Brucellosis has been most diagnozed (Fig. 12), whilst in the United Provinces,
SEPTEMBER, 1948 ] JOHN B. POLDING 117 Punjab and North West Frontier Province tests have been disappointingly few. It is carefully to be considered, therefore, whether the results shown in the figure are, on this account, invalid. Leaving aside for the moment the serological test, reports of actual clinical abortions in villages are un- doubtedly received voluntarily in the south-east, whilst in the north-west it is impossible to extract an admission from proprietors that such an occurrence is other than very rare. Now the villagers in the south-eastern tracts are often very orthodox and sometimes shy and ignorant too and it seems unlikely that they would describe an occurrence unless it actually happened. Moreover, village headmen will more or less willingly produce some 15 to 20 animals alleged to have aborted. So that the common finding of a high proportion of strongly positive blood tests amongst these 'aborters', together with the occasional isolation of a distinctive Brucella variant, surely corroborates the villager's statements. In the north-west, however, the inhabitants are often well-informed and capable zemindars, yet they deny that abortion is common, resist blood sampling and in other words cannot be bothered with a subject the importance of which has evidently not been made plain to them by actual losses. Such tests as can be made hereabouts reveal only occasional doubtful, or more rarely, weakly posi- tive reactors. The inference is that the incidence of village infection as shown in Fig. 12 is, as far as it goes, correct; nevertheless, whilst it can be generally accepted that village infection is rare in the north- west and common in the south-east, it is of course highly probable that more centres of village infec- tion remain to be discovered, especially in the extreme east, centre and south-west. Lastly it must be always borne in mind that it is not suggested that Brucellosis is totally absent from village cattle in the north-west; it is only stated that the incidence appears to be insignificant. A detailed survey with reference to climatic * regions A detailed description of the occurrence of Brucellosis, province by province, would be of scant general interest. So, because it is believed that the disease occurs with a certain relation to climate, a synopsis of its local incidence in regions of similar climate and character is given in Table I, while, for the interest of local workers a detailed place-to-place survey, together with notes on climate are interpolated in small print at the end of the sub-head.

118 Contagious Abortion of Cattle, Sheep and Goats [VOL. XVIII, PART III A study of the detailed survey suggests that, as far as farms are concerned, Brucellosis is most prevalent where farms are abundant, but there is some evidence to suggest that, provided there is a sufficient reservoir of infection, epidemics and endemics in farms are gravest where rainfall is either very heavy, as in the coastal belt of Bombay and in Assam, or, to a lesser degree, in the bi-seasonal or tri-seasonal rainfall areas, such as the Himalayan water-shed, east of Meerut, Ambala and Lahore. As for infection in village stock, inspection of Table I reveals a curious and interesting posi- tion. Infection, as far as it has been discovered, lies mainly in the tri-seasonal rainfall area of the peninsula south-east of the red line, Fig. 12. It has, however, advanced as far as, and follows with considerable accuracy the limits of the bi-seasonal rainfall area (south-east of the blue line, Fig. 12). Conversely, the area of minimum village infection seems to be the arid north-west. But, although, throughout these epidemiological studies, it is necessary to bear in mind the fundamental function of climate, its precise role can only be postulated when all other considerations have been brought into account. A DETAILED SURVEY OF BRUCELLOSIS IN INDIA BY CLIMATIC REGIONS Region 1. Sind, Baluchistan, North-West Frontier Province, Rajputana and Ajmer This region consists of the Thar desert, the partially irrigated lower Indus valley and the arid hills of the north-west; the mean annual rainfall is the least in India. Village stock. In this region, village Brucellosis seems to be rare or absent. Thus enquiries by the Veterinary Investigation Officers of Sind and the North-West Frontier Province and the writer elicited the invariable reply that village abortions occurred with extreme rarity. Again random tests at Peshawar, Karachi and in the Rajputana States showed a few doubtful or weakly positive reactors. Abortion in sheep and goats, on the other hand, is relatively common, but all tests on these animals have been negative to Brucellosis and the mishap can usually be attributed to other causes (page 189). Farm stock. In the few organized farms of these parts, clinical abortions and Brucella reactors are either absentSEPTEMBER, 1948 ] JOHN B. POLDING 119 the last decade. Similar results have been obtained in the past by an examination of private gow- shalas of this province. Farm stock 2120 Contagious Abortion of Cattle, Sheep and Goats [ VOL.

Travelling eastwards from Akola where Brucella reactors in village cattle are first encountered [viz., 4 out of 46 (8 per cent) at Akola and Ellichpur], abortions are first reported around Nagpur itself. Hereabouts, 12 out of 65 (18 per cent) animals tested were Brucella positive. South-east of Nagpur in the Chanda district abortions and positive reactors have been noted, whilst between Nagpur and Raipur and around Raipur itself abortions become even commoner and out of 71 animals 18 (25 per cent) reactors were found. A gap occurs in the survey south of Chanda and the enquiry is taken up again around Warangal in Hyderabad State, where, in at least three villages, abortions have been frequent in the last decade and the incidence of positive reactors was 42 per cent of the herds. The territory just described merges with the coastal district of Orissa and the occurrence of village Brucellosis continues across the provincial boundary. Thus in the adjacent Orian district of Nawa- para 42 per cent reactors were encountered in tests of several village herds and abortion was alleged to be very common. Around Sambhalpur, Jharsaguda and Angul the reactor rate was 31 per cent, whilst south of Cuttack in the Berhampur district the incidence of reactors was the highest yet recorded in villages (viz., 50 per cent) and abortions were again very common. Two Brucella A/M type strains (the term A/M is used from now on to define the aberrant village Brucella type found in south India and described on page 144) have been isolated from this area. In the recently opened up Orian interior round Russelkonda and Koraput positive reactors, while present, were much less frequent than in other parts. Passing south along the coast Brucellosis is again encountered at Vizagapatam; whilst at Bezwada, although only doubtful Brucella reactors have been so far obtain- ed, abortion and enlarged synovial joints are reported. However very few tests in cattle have been made in this section. In Nellore town, only goats were available for bleeding, but an 8 per cent incidence of reactors in these animals suggests that Brucellosis is common in cattle hereabouts; a supposition corroborated by the results obtained in villages some 22 miles to the south, near Godur. Here, in one village, 16 out of 37 (43 per cent) cattle were strongly positive and clinical abortions were said to be very common. Three village strains were isolated in this area, once again all being of the A/M type. As yet serious infection has not been discovered around Madras city, but the disease has been diagnozed southwards along the coast at Chidambaram. The scene of the survey now shifts inland to the country around Trichinopoly, where infrequent tests failed to reveal infec- tion. A little to the south, however, in Madura district, the trail was again picked up and infection was detected at the slaughter-house in Kodaikanal; whilst around Periaculum considerable infec- tion was once more encountered. In eight villages hereabouts, 18 out of 71 (25 per cent) animals were positive to the test and abortion and enlargements of the synovial joints were common. Some infection was found in and around Madura itself. South and east of Madura, infection has been diagnosed near Tinnevelly and Ramnad respectively. Proceeding north and west from Madura, infection was again encountered at Pollachi whilst around Conoor and Ootacamund it is fairly wide- spread. In the Ootacamund slaughter house the incidence of reactors was about 8 per cent and in that of Conoor about 5 per cent, whilst in seven adjacent villages 22 (58 per cent) out of 38 cattle were positive to the test and abortion is alleged to be frequent. On the west coast, infection has been diagnozed in random slaughter-house tests at Calicut and Tellicherry. On the Mysore-Madras boundary, two more taluqs were found to be heavily infected viz., Hosur and Kollegal. In seven villages of the former taluq, 28 (55 per cent) out of 51 cattle were Brucella positive and in nine villages of Kollegal, 32 (35 per cent) out of 91 animals were reactors. Clinical abortion is said to be common in this area. In Mysore State the occurrence of Brucellosis seems to be very much on the wane and on that side of the state adjacent to Kollegal, it was not possible to trace any infection, whilst the wild Amrit Mahal herds also appear to be disease free. One sharp outbreak has been detected, however, in a village of the Kadur district of northern Mysore, but notwithstanding that further north still village infection appears to die out with a few random weak reactors to be found in the Kanara forest in the extreme south of Bombay Presidency, a Brucella A/M type strain similar in character to the village strains of this region has been isolated from a synovial enlargement of a cow of the Kanara district.
SEPTEMBER, 1948 ] JOHN B. POLDING 123 It must be remarked that most of the positive sera collected in Madras reacted to a high titre and one or two reached to the unusual orders of 1 in 10 and 20 thousand. Although the diagnostic value of the serum agglutination test for Brucellosis is discussed fully in the appropriate place, it might not be out of place in view of the peculiarities of village survey and the large number of positive reactors obtained in this region, to give here a Table showing the incidence of reactors in relation to the clinical history of the animal, as alleged by the village spokes- man.

For example, whenever numerous abortions were reported in a small village, several positive reactors were nearly always found amongst them ; but when only one or two aborters were to be found these animals would often be negative and such isolated cases make up a large number of the 59 negatives shown in the Table. It would appear that synovial enlargements are more often than not connected with Brucellosis, as many of the negative animals included in the Table had passed the active stage of fluid enlargement and had reached the stage of induration, when animals are less likely to react. The number of villages considered in the foregoing review was approximately 70. Reports of abortions in sheep and goats are very unusual throughout the whole of this region and the over-all incidence of Brucella reactors in these animals was 3.1 per cent, the greatest incidence being found around Nellore and in Orissa. At Vizagapattam, of 892 sheep and goats, but 15 (less than 2 per cent) were positive. Farm stock. In the indigenous stock of Government and jail herds Brucellosis was as a rule absent. One exception was a government farm on the east coast, where abortions in cows and buffaloes occasionally occur ; seven out of 55 animals were positive to the Brucella test. At one time there was an infected military herd of cross-bred cattle near Conoor, which has since been dis- persed. The remnants of this herd are still to be found at Bangalore, but the disease does not appear to have spread from them to co-habiting indigenous cattle. A private herd of mixed European and indigenous cattle at Mysore is also infected. B
124 Contagious Abortion of Cattle, Sheep and Goats [ VOL. XVIII, PART III Region 6. Central and northern Bombay and adjacent states This region is bordered on the west by a fertile coastal plain, wide in the north, but narrowing to the south, between the western ghats and the sea. The major portion of the interior is a plateau, or hilly. Apart from June to October, when in the coastal tract the monsoon is exceptionally heavy and is elsewhere considerable, the northern portions and interior are, for the rest of the year, practi- cally without rain. The southern extremity however, receives more than 2 in. of rain during March, April and May. Rainfall is, therefore, bi-seasonal at this spot only. Village stock. As far as can be ascertained Brucellosis in village cattle is at present rare in this region. It seems probable, however, that, in the coastal belt at least, infection may at any time spread to the villages from the severe epidemics sometimes found on Bombay farms. Organized farms. Most of the organized farms of this region lie in the coastal tract adjacent to Bombay and many of them are private gowshalas, some of which have developed into quasi-com- mercial concerns. Some carry indigenous cows whilst others combine these with buffaloes. There are also a number of dairies in and around Bombay that keep in-milk buffaloes only. There are four military farms carrying cross-bred stock in this region proper and another closeby in the Central Indian Agency. In the four smaller farms the abortion rate is less than 2 per cent per annum and the incidence of Brucella reactors is 12 per cent alike of tested buffaloes and cows. In the fifth and largest farm, the annual abortion rate was 8 per cent of cows and 4 per cent of buffaloes, while the incidence of Brucella reactors at the time of inspection was 41 per cent and 63 per cent respectively. The former figure is surprisingly low and the latter, the highest on record for Indian buffaloes. But two farms of indigenous cows are believed to be free from Brucellosis, one a government herd of Amrit Mahals at Bankapur and another a private herd of Gir cattle about 20 miles outside Bombay city. In the remaining three herds, visited in 1940-41, abortions were occurring, although their histories were unrecorded or confused, while, despite the great difficulty of obtaining permission to bleed, positive Brucella reactors were found. The average abortion rate in these herds was 1 per cent per annum and positive reactors occurred at the rate of 34 per cent of animals bled. Since 1940, severe epidemics of abortion have been found in two additional herds of this type; in one, 77 per cent of the breeding stock aborted in two years and 95 per cent of the aborting animals were Brucella positive; in the other, 40 animals aborted in a few months. Both farms purchased from Bombay city, pregnant animals which on abortion started the epidemics. Once there were several buffalo dry-stock farms lying along the humid coastal belt, north of Bombay and serving the milking stables of that city, but all have since been closed owing, it is alleg- ed, to the very great incidenceSEPTEMBER, 1948] JOHN B.

They are obtained by multiplying the mean expectation of loss of calves per aborting animal [Table X column 7] by the mean expectation of unrepeated abortion during the lifetime of 100 random animals [Table IX]. If the smallest figure is taken as unity, the relative susceptibility of zebu, co-habiting zebu, and crosses is found to be as 1 : 2.5 : 7. In future, figures so obtained will be alluded to as the susceptibility index the figure for the zebu being, in all cases, regarded as unity. Some findings suggest, either that the susceptibility of Indian cows to Brucellosis is decreasing, or that a better knowledge of the disease in relation to animal management is limiting its spread. For example, the reports of the military farms (northern circle) from 1932 to 1939 show a progres- sive annual decrease in the abortion rate ; a decrease which runs parallel with improvements in hous- ing and management. On the other hand, since 1939 there have been indications that, in the busier farms at least, the rate has again increased and this has coincided with the unavoidable lessened attention and over-crowding due to the wartime emergency and expansion. It seems probable, therefore, that good management, rather than reduced susceptibility, was the cause of the earlier decrease ; neverthelessSEPTEMBER, 1948] JOHN B.

POLDING 131 As with cows, so with buffaloes there are exceptional rates of abortion. These occur in two forms, viz., (1) severe epidemics, of which Brucellosis is fairly plainly the cause and (2) exceptional epidemics appearing mostly in villages, about which little is known. The former are not very common, but data of two such epidemics are given in Tables XXI and XXII. The latter are discussed more fully on page 188. Sheep and Goats In the five years of the scheme not a single abortion in sheep has on investigation been attribut- able to Brucellosis, nor can the writer recall a significant incidence of reactors in these animals, either where abortions were epidemic, or where sheep were in contact with infected cattle. It must be supposed, therefore, that the susceptibility of Indian sheep to Brucellosis is indeed slight. The goat, on the other hand, seems to be rather more susceptible, for, although Brucellosis has not hitherto been diagnosed in cases of clinical abortion amongst village goats, in two old-established goat farms, this disease has undeniably co-existed with abortions. The specificity of these abortions has, however, been disputed and their description has consequently been relegated to the section on non-specific abortion. Whilst testing in slaughter houses, occasional isolated reactors have been encountered amongst sheep and goats alike and it is remarkable that these have been occurred only in south India, where Brucellosis is common in village cattle, viz., of 405 sheep and goats bled in 15 towns of south India, 11 (2.5 per cent) were positive ; of 250 tested in 11 towns of north India, none was positive. Inextricably entangled as it is with many improperly understood features of disease transmis- sion susceptibility per se is a most imponderable characteristic and its mensuration on a basis of rates of abortion and loss of calves is consequently bound to be fraught with inaccuracies. Never- theless, it is felt, that the foregoing are tolerable estimates of the ordinary liability of Indian cattle to contract Brucellosis. In an exceptiona environment, any class of stock may behave in an un- predictable manner and the response of animals to infection by Brucellosis is not likely to be exempt from such irregularities. One more point requires mention ; it has been stated in the past that many Punjab goats are infected with Brucellosis and the infection rate has been variably estimated at from 8 to 60 per cent. These rates are greatly at variance with themselves and the present findings, but it must be recalled, that the antigenic instability of rough Brucella strains was not understood until the middle-thirties of the present century and that the Br. melitensis strains, usually used for testing goats, were almost always rough. Numerous old records are still in existence, wherein 9/10 of the positive results of Brucella tests are clearly the outcome of unstable antigens and this supposedly would account for many former misconceptions. Infection in the goat will be referred to at greater length when the question of human infection is being considered (page 153). SECTION III (EPIDEMIOLOGY). THE DISSEMINATION OF BRUCELLOSIS IN INDIA The roles of climate and hygiene The channels by which Brucella leave their host are too familiar to deserve discussion in so prescribed a space as this paper. The point to be noted is that, although, Brucella organisms are considered obligatory parasites, in favourable circumstances, they will survive and disseminate outside the host. In this country, the effects on their survival of sunshine, of high temperatures and of dryness, on the one hand, and, of humidity, of moderate temperatures, and of reduced sunlight on the other, can be vividly contrasted in north and south India. In the whole of the north-west, scorching sun- shine is diurnal from April to October, natural shade is rare, while the annual rainfall is but one inch, or less. In the south, conditions are reversed, temperatures vary little about the blood heat of cattle, the atmosphere and the land surface and soil are moist while, not only is natural shade everywhere C
132 Contagious Abortion of Cattle, Sheep and Goats [VOL. XVIII, PART III more common, but for fairly long periods the sun is overcast altogether. But it has already been shown that Brucellosis is endemic in the south and rare in the north-west (page 116). The simple and understandable inference is, that sunshine and dryness are inimical to Brucella microbes, or conversely that equible temperatures, humidity and shade are propitious to their survival. Other more isolated observations corroborate these suppositions. On page 128 allusion has been made to the decrease of Brucellosis on the Punjab Grantee Farms. These farms lie in a semi-dessert tract and for the most part their indigenous stock live and calve out-of-doors. It is possible that this is an example of self-elimination of Brucellosis due to animals living in dry, sunlit surroundings. In contrast to this, are the returns from three farms situated in Assam, a region which endures a heavy and protracted monsoon and which, moreover, lies within the bi-seasonal rainfall belt of India. The animals of these farms are of similar type and origin to those of the grantee herds, yet in 1941 the incidence of reactors amongst them was 20 per cent, whilst their abortion rate is from 2 to 6 per cent per annum. In another indigenous herd of the Punjab [farm (1)], the mean annual abortion rate during the climatically normal period 1930 to 1935 was 1.27 per cent of completed pregnancies, whilst, during the entirely rainless period 1936 to 1939, this rate was 0.66 per cent, i.e., a reduction by half. Here, another important consideration arises, for, during the rainless years the stock could not be grazed and had to be stall-fed in congested corrals. The result of this over-crowding was a severe epidemic of tuberculosis. It appears, therefore, that conditions of congestion, sufficient to produce an air- born respiratory epidemic of a relatively resistant organism, resulted in a diminution of Brucella infection during a period of constant sunshine and extreme dryness. Congestion as a factor in the spread of Brucellosis, therefore, may be secondary to excess of sunlight and it seems likely that Brucellosis is essentially not an air-born disease. In contradistinction to this result, are the findings at a pinjrapole [farm (2)] situated on the arid Deccan plateau. During 1941-42 this farm suffered an extremely violent epidemic of Brucellosis and 77 per cent of the herd aborted. Here, climatic variation was negligible and sunlight was more or less continuous. Congestion also was extreme, the animals never being out of the farm compound. The contradictory results of farms I and II may perhaps be explained on the grounds of hygiene. In farm (I) aborting animals are segregated and gross infective materials, such as the placenta, are quickly destroyed. In farm (II), no such precautions were taken and general cleanliness was lacking. In cows, therefore, it appears that, provided gross sources of dissemination are removed, the sterilizing effects of sunlight are sufficient to suppress the remaining minor sources of infection, even when congestion is great; conversely, where animals are dispersed hygiene becomes of less importance and the effects of sunlight are paramount. Village cattle, on the whole, graze over wide areas and bacterial dispersion, therefore, counteracts the lack of hygiene, so that, here again, sunlight plays a major part in the suppression of contamination. There are, however, other aspects of the effects of climate upon the dissemination of Brucella' i.e., humidity and rainfall and the possible role played by moisture is very well illustrated by the restriction of indigenous Brucellosis to the humid tracts of India, and especially by some aspects Brucella epidemiology in buffaloes. Only one serious endemic of Brucellosis has been encountered in buffaloes (farm 3). The abortion rate on this farm is shown in Table XXI and, for India, it is undeniably excessive, possibly unique. In an attempt to explain this unusual incidence, many environmental factors have been considered, but the only extraordinary influence that could be found was the exceptionally heavy monsoon, amounting to 80 in. of rainfall in the period June to Septem- ber. Table XXIII presents a statement of the percentage rates of abortion amongst susceptible stock for each month of the year, the calculation being made from an aggregate of the returns for five years. The head of stock that was adjudged susceptible to abortion in any one month was the aggregate of animals carrying a foetus between five and nine months of age inclusively. This period of term was selected after a study of Table XX. A further study of the same Table, however indicates that the liability to abort differs in the various months selected in the proportion of
SEPTEMBER, 1948] JOHN B. POLDING 133 1 : 1.75 : 2.75 : 3.25 : 3.5 for the months five to nine respectively. In each case, therefore, the aggregate of animals pregnant in each month was multiplied by its respective liability factor, and the sum of these calculations was taken to be the corrected number of susceptible animals [Table (XXIII) column 8].

Figures in column 8=the sum of the figures in columns 2 to 6, after application of the abortion liability ratio, plus the figures in column 7. The result of this calculation shows that the abortion rate for the months November to July varied little about a mean figure of 1.4. It is further to be noticed that, although the population of susceptible animals steadily increases from January to July, there is no corresponding increase in the abortion rate. In August, however, whilst the number of susceptible animals commences to decrease the abortion rate suddenly doubles and in September and October it is just thrice the mean for the normal months of the year. Thereafter, the rate returns to normal. Now as the period of transmis- sion and incubation of the disease is likely to occupy a period of one to two months, the critical period of increased infection rate causing the increased abortion rate during August, September and October, commences in mid-June and lasts up to August. But in this period the abortion rate and, therefore, presumably the bacterial elimination rate, is constant, whilst the corrected number of susceptible animals does not vary greatly round a mean of 1200 ; further the absolute number of abortions in July is the same as in May. In other words donor and receptor influences do not vary sufficiently during this period to account for the large increase of abortions in August, September and October, and this increase, must be explained by a change in environment which affects bacterial survival and transmission. But from June until August the climate changes completely from diurnal sunlight to total sunlessness and continuous rainfall and this suggests that either the absence of sunlight, or the presence of moisture, or both, favours the spread of Brucellosis in buffaloes. c2
134 Contagious Abortion of Cattle, Sheep and Goats [VOL. XVIII, PART III As before, however, the factor of congestion complicates this picture. During the monsoon buffaloes cannot be grazed and they are consequently standing in congested cowsheds, sometimes for weeks at a stretch. The influence of congestion may perhaps be eliminated by comparing this result with the records of farm 2, page 131, which, besides carrying the herd of Brucella-infected cattle already discussed, keeps a herd of closely co-habiting buffaloes. Now on each farm, the factor of congestion is probably about equal but on farm 2, as evidenced by the spread in cows, the abundant sunlight was unable to destroy the infection. Thus the two environments may be compared as follows :SEPTEMBER, 1948] JOHN B. POLDING 135 systemic disturbances. More remotely, it may be supposed that many buffalo abortions are not due to Brucellosis at all, but to some quite unrecognized factor of rainfall, a preposition which receives further consideration on page 188. Plainly, the dissemination of Brucella in India is influenced by several interdependent factors and, while it is not possible wholly to disentangle their individual roles, some tentative postulates come to mind. The factors which inhibit fruitful dissemination are elementary hygiene, sunshine and animal dispersion, and where indigenous cattle are concerned, the optimum action of all the three will result in a gradual elimination of the disease, or prevent its gaining a hold on an already clean farm. Further, the combined action of any two factors is likely to minimize the disease, but, where one factor alone is operative, the disease will in all probability spread. Conversely, the influences propitious to dissemination are absence of hygiene, absence of sunshine and congestion. The conflicting roles of humidity and dryness are less ponderable, but at least it is easier to clean dry hard surfaces, than wet and muddy ones, while the vehicular value of fluids cannot be ignored. Many epidemiologists have associated moisture with the spread of diseases. Rogers [1926], for example, found that cholera spreads as the absolute humidity reaches 0.4 in. and it may be noted in passing that, in lower Bengal and on the Coromandel and Malabar coasts (i.e., in the Brucella endemic areas of India), the absolute humidity is never below 0.4 in. About Brucella little has been proffered, but Horrocks [1905] found that these organisms sur- vived for 43 days, in soil that was allowed to dry naturally (in Malta) and for 72 days in damp soil. Be that as it may, whether soil-moisture, the relative or absolute humidity of the atmosphere, or a tri-seasonal rather than uni-seasonal rainfall is considered, the main function of the moisture will be to delay or obviate drying. Consequently, the effect of drying Brucella has been studied in one or two simple experiments. In one series of tests, 0.5 cc. of a Brucella suspension in saline (density=Brown's scale 5 ; approxi- mate live count=10,000 million organisms) was pipetted on to filter papers previously placed in lightly plugged test tubes. A 1/10 dilution of the suspension could be reconstructed from these papers by pipetting 4.5 cc. of saline into a still-wet filter paper, or 5.0 cc. into a paper that had dried. Re-suspension was effected by pulping and wringing the paper with the pipette. The resulting suspension was used to make a ten-fold rising dilution series for counting. Later, this technique was abandoned, as unevenness of the paper pulp caused irregularity of counts. Using this method, the effect of rapid drying in vacuo was studied. Attached to a Chryochem* apparatus and subjected to a vacuum of 50µ the papers took about 1 hour to dry. No artificial freezing was used but self-freezing may have occurred towards the end of the process. The suspen- sion was counted before placing on filter paper, again after reconstruction immediately after deposi- tion on the paper and finally immediately after drying. The results of duplicate counts are shown in Table XXIV and reveal that a large number of Brucella die during rapid drying under vacuum, even at room temperature (20-25°C).

136 Contagious Abortion of Cattle, Sheep and Goats [VOL. XVIII, PART III After drying, the vacuum was released and some unused papers were stored over CaCl2 at 42°C ; from time to time they were pulped and the suspensions counted. Despite the irregularities already mentioned, the counts indicated that the death rate was dramatically swift (Fig. 1). In a second experiment, using the same technique the artificial drying in vacuum was omitted and the samples were placed directly in the 42°C incubator, some over CaCl2 and others over H2O and H2SO2 variously mixed to produce relative atmospheric humidities of 40 per cent, 80 per cent and 90 per cent. This experiment failed because the death-rate was so rapid that it quite outstripped the dilutions selected for counts, all that could be learnt was that the samples over CaCl2 showed a count of nil in the 1/100 and 1/10 dilution at 24 and 38 hours respectively (lower plates were not made). In the 90 per cent humidity, on the other hand, one count of 1.4 millions per cc. was obtain- ed at the 56 hour. It is to be noted that in the CaCl2 atmosphere the papers were nearly dry at 20 hours, when a count of 800 million was obtained. Whereas, at 32 hours the paper was perfectly dry and in the interim the count had fallen almost to nothing. Conversely, the paper in the 90 per cent humidity was not dry at the 92 hour. These preliminaries suggest that in the quite ordinary summer plains temperature of 42°C Brucella die within 36 hours, in dry air but in moist, remain alive for three or four days. The foregoing technique was now abandoned and instead, 0.5 cc. amounts of suspension were pipetted into several covered, empty, 1½ in. petri dishes, which in turn were placed in the various atmospheres. A suspension was reconstructed by adding 5.0 cc. of saline to a dry plate, whilst an estimated quantity between 4.5 and 5.0 cc. was added to one partially dry. (The error necessarily occurring here is appreciated, but, as such large differences are concerned it is probably not important.) Again, as 42°C is rather higher than the usual day maximum in the humid parts of India, the storage temperature was reduced to 37°C which is commonplace in winter and summer in the endemic areas. Using this method, it was found that 0.5 cc. of suspension over CaCl2 dried completely between the 26 and 30 hour and that during the period 18 to 42 hours the count dropped from 990 millions to 0.066 million. In 80 per cent humidity on the other hand, the count dropped from 5,800 millions to 220 millions in the same period, while drying was incomplete at 90 hours (Fig. 2). The above experiment was, nevertheless, unsatisfactory, mainly owing to incorrect estimates of which dilutions to plate at the later counts. Again it was thought that the salt in the saline suspension might be playing an inimical part as it became concentrated during drying. So the experiment was repeated but bacteria suspended in distilled water, instead of saline were used. The results appear in Fig. 3 and, while both death-rates are considerably slower in pure water than in saline, the mortality in dry atmosphere is again more rapid than in the humid. It is to be noted moreover, that natural drying of Brucella is unlikely to occur often in a substrate entirely free from salts. The foregoing experiments contribute towards a better knowledge of the roles played by humidity and dryness in the dissemination of Brucella in Asia and reviewing them in conjunction with the actual findings of the Indian field, it might not be too rash to suggest that a cornerstone has been laid in the construction of a hitherto neglected aspect of Brucella epidemiology. The role of seasonal breeding When the buffaloes' habit of breeding seasonally causes them to be advanced in pregnancy dur- ing the monsoon, Brucellosis, once established, will tend to spread. This tendency might possibly be corrected by inducing the animals to breed at a more favourable season. Reservoirs of infection The principal reservoirs of Brucellosis in India are to be found where the environment favours dissemination viz., (i) in congested city stables, as found in Calcutta and Bombay, whence the disease
SEPTEMBER, 1948] JOHN B. POLDING 137 is disseminated by the sale of dry cattle to the surrounding country, (ii) in south-Indian villages; here, cattle movements from south to north are probably insufficient to permit a grave extension of infection, but a possible route has been suggested on page 145.

138 Contagious Abortion of Cattle, Sheep and Goats [VOL. XVIII, PART III It is probable that a further big reservoir is even now developing. The vastly increased buffalo population in military establishments cannot be given the attention it would receive in normal times. Moreover, temporary farms are being erected in the unfavourable climates of south and east India. It is not improbable that Brucellosis will spread among these animals and these may disseminate disease to other parts of India when dispersed.

THE BACTERIOLOGY OF INDIAN STRAINS To rehearse the whole bacteriology of Brucellosis, or to cite a torrent of references here, would be supererogatory and those unfamiliar with its details are referred to the many excellent treatise in the literature ; in the pages to follow, the subject is dealt with solely in so far as it concerns the disease in India. Classification The bacterial genus Brucella is usually supposed to contain three species Br. abortus, Br. meli- tensis and Br. suis. Not all strains, however, can be so classified and, in an examination of some 2,000, Huddleson [1939] has mentioned 13 that were atypical. Some eight or ten methods of classify- ing the genus have been described, but the criteria most commonly used are based on (i) CO2 require- ments at isolation (ii) antigenic structure, (iii) H2S excretion and (iv) the inhibitory action of dye media. Because all tests are relative estimations of biological processes and as most are very suscep- tible to errors of technique and personal judgement, they should be made as far as possible on a number of strains at the same time and by the same person, using a standard technique and a single batch of original media. The techniques used in the present work have been as follows :SEPTEMBER, 1948] JOHN B. POLDING 141 is likely to vary more than that of tryptose). After sowing, a slip of filter paper, previously soaked in a saturated solution of lead acetate and sterilized in hot air, is inserted beside the plug of each culture-tube so that it projects into its lumen. The slants are incubated at 37°C for eight days. At the end of each 24 hours of this interval, the slips of filter paper are removed and fresh inserted. The removed slips are labelled, dated and retained as a record of the degree of blackening of their surface due to the formation of lead sulphide by the interaction of H2S and lead acetate. Br. melitensis strains eliminate no H2S. Br. abortus strains eliminate medium quantities of H2S for three or four days only. Br. suis strains eliminate maximum quantities of H2S for upwards of six consecutive days. (iii) The inhibitory action of dye media. A single batch of tryptose or liver agar pH 6.6 to 6.8 is prepared and divided into seven lots. Lot (1) is left unaltered. Lots (2), (3) and (4) are melted and whilst warm a hot aqueous solution of basic fuchsin is added to each so that the final concentration of dye in the three lots is 1/75,000, 1/85,000 and 1/100,000, respectively. In the same way, a hot aqueous solution of thionin is added to lots (5), (6) and (7) so that the dye concentration in the final preparation is 1/50,000, 1/60,000 and 1/70,000 respectively. Plates are poured from each of the seven lots and two or three strains of each of the three type variants are sown into each of the seven different media. Seeding is done by transferring standard large loopsfull of a 48-hour old broth culture of the strains under examination. The plates are incubated at 37°C for three days and their growth examined on the second and third day. The growth on the plain agar is taken as a standard for each strain and is compared with the degree of growth on the various batches of dye media. The object of this work is to select the concentration of dye which best permits a normal growth of Br. melitensis strains on both thionin and fuchsin and which at the same time, just inhibits the growth of Br. suis on fuchsin, whilst allowing its growth on thionin and inhibits the growth of Br. abortus on thionin whilst permitting its growth on fuchsin. Having selected the most suitable concentrations of dye, the unknown strains are seeded in the same way into plates of the selected concentration of dye media and plain liver agar. The in- hibitory effects of the dyes are noted and the unknown strains allocated to their various types accordingly. In this work it is important that all media be freshly prepared and of the correct pH. No delay, therefore, should be permitted between the trial run with known strains and the tests on unknown strains. (iv) Antigenic structure. Type specific antisera are prepared by injecting separate rabbits with one of the type variants, Br. abortus and Br. melitensis. One intravenous injection only is given the dose being approximately 4,000×106 organisms, in 1.0 cc. of saline. Sera with titres in the order of 1/2,560 are the most convenient in use and therefore the rabbit's blood must be tested daily after the third day and the animals killed and bled when the previous day's test shows a titre in the order of 1/640-1/1,280, or thereabouts. The sera should then be cold-stored for a week, during which time their titres will fall a little. To prepare the absorbing systems Wilson and Miles [1932] who also describe the theory of this work142 Contagious Abortion of Cattle, Sheep and Goats [VOL. XVIII, PART III abortus and the Melitensis, monospecific melitensis serum. Each primary dilution of each mono- specific serum is then titrated against abortus and melitensis antigens, which are prepared in the ordinary manner (p. 149). If all has gone well, the monospecific sera should react to between the fourth and seventh dilution with their homologous antigens, and not at all, or to one or two dilu- tions only, with their heterologous antigens. In each case the dilution of monospecific serum which gives the greatest difference of titre between the homologous and heterologous titrations is selected for use. The series of dilutions used in the final titrations are prepared by doubling the dilution in each succeeding tube of a series and, assuming the primary dilution of a serum is 1/20, the final titration series would run 1/40, 1/80 and so on. Whilst, if absorption had been nearly optimum, the serum would react to about +1/640 with its homologous antigen and to about +1/40 with the heterologous. To differentiate unknown Brucella strains all that is necessary is to prepare antigens from them (p. 149) and titrate each against monospecific abortus and melitensis sera. It is to be noted that absorption of Br. suis antiserum is purposeless, as neither antibody is present in excess of the other. Similarly, if Br. suis antigen, in which neither antigenic factor is present in excess, be titrated against monospecific sera, equal titrations are likely to result. The rough or so-called ' para ' strains cannot be classified serologically. In India, the obtaining of satisfactory specimens for bacterial examination presents many peculiar difficulties not encountered in temperate climates. The main troubles are the early putre- scene of dead tissues, dust contamination, long periods of transport in warm environment, but above all difficulties of communications, for abortions usually occur without notice in remote localities, which cannot be reached in time by persons qualified and equipped to take samples fit for bacterial examination. The Brucella strains it has been possible to secure have consequently been disappoint- ingly few, but, such as they are, their origin and classification are given in Table XXV.

It is noteworthy that all pure abortus strains come from organized farms most of which have carried, or still carry, European cross-bred stock, and they occur equally in cows and buffaloes. As regards the melitensis strains, in all the three, there was some doubt as to exact classification (Table XXVI).

XVIII, PART III It will be observed that the first two strains were rough and, therefore, their antigenic structure could not be examined, but in all probability they are normal melitensis types. It is alleged that they were isolated some years ago from a cow and a goat in the Punjab. The third, was isolated from a naval rating in Poona hospital and, whilst growing in air and CO2 and falling to produce H2S, it grew but weakly on thionin and its antigenic structure appears to be more A than M. The origin of these Melitensis strains is obscure, but it seems possible that there is a slight occurrence of Br. melitensis infection in northern India.

SEPTEMBER, 1948] JOHN B. POLDING 145 The 20 strains termed unclassified all differed from true Br. abortus types in one main character- istic i.e. they grew on both thionin and fuschin. Also the majority although undeniably abortus antigenically showed a slight tendency not to differentiate so sharply as pure abortus types on sero- logical tests against monospecific sera and two were distinctly melitensis in this respect. One strain isolated from Patna and one from Mukteswar, whilst conforming to the above grouping, also grew in air at isolation. Table XXVII illustrates the typing results of some of these ambiguous strains ; those not shown in the Table were unexceptional in their behaviour as A/M strains, and are typified by the Madras or Orissa village strains of the Table. On first examining these strains, it was thought that a technical error had crept in, but, when the work was repeated keeping careful controls, it was found that if the dye concentration was low enough to permit the growth of melitensis on both media, and if ordinary European, and undoubted Indian, abortus strains were inhibited on thionin, but grew on fuschin, the results with these aberrent strains were always the same. Moreover, field strains were always typed in lots of 10 or 12 at the same time, and it is significant that, out of 49 strains, no less than 20 inescapably gave this ambiguous result. It is concluded therefore that this abortus/melitensis type is a common Indian Brucella variant, its constant characteristic being its ability to grow on both thionin and fuschin. Variably, it will grow in air on first isolation [2 cases out of 20 (10 per cent)] again its antigenic constitution shows in stability two strains out of 20 (10 per cent) being melitensis in antigenic form, the remainder conforming more or less to the abortus structure. Regarding the origin of these aberrent types, it is significant that all the six strains isolated from the village endemic area of the Indian peninsula were of this nature. It is suggested, therefore, that this is a south Indian indigenous variant and the true Br. abortus type, hitherto found exclusively in organized farms, is an imported European strain. This finding strengthens the postulate that there is an area of indigenous infection almost exclusively confined to the Indian peninsula. Further, a consideration of the part played by climate in Brucella dissemination suggests that, if there was a spread of infection from south India it would be likely to occur along the relative humid Himalayan foot-hills and perhaps descend into the Gangetic plain. It is of interest, therefore, that the abortus/melitensis strains, so far isolated from organized farms, have been found at Jubbulpore, not very distant from the endemic area of Nagpur and Raipur, and at Bihar, Lucknow, Mukteswar and Hissar, whither infection may well have spread in the manner suggested. Agglutination absorption tests have been made on these abortus/melitensis strains to observe whether they contain any additional, hitherto undescribed antigen, but this does not appear to be the case. Dissociation Rough forms of Brucella can sometimes be recovered from the animate host, while they may also arise after prolonged artificial culture, especially if grown in fluids. The species melitensis dissociates very much more readily than the other members of the genus, and amongst the present collection of Indian strains, two out of three melitensis types were rough when examined several sub-cultures after isolation, whereas, of 26 Br. abortus strains, one only was semi-rough at the culture of isolation. However, of 18 Br. abortus strains retested after some 15 or 20 transfers on liver agar, six had become partially rough and two wholly rough. None of the abortus/melitensis strains was rough at isolation, but of 13 retested after some 15 or 20 transfers four had become partially rough and one wholly rough. Rough strains are of course antigenically unstable and are not used for ordinary purposes. Strains were examined for dissociation as follows. Two-day old agar cultures were suspended in 12 per cent saline and adjusted to a density of 1 to 2 on the Brown's scale. The suspensions were placed in a boiling water-bath, readings for agglutination being made after 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes. The suspensions were then removed and left on the bench until the following morning when they were again examined for agglutination. A strain showing any agglutination in these circum- stances was regarded as antigenically unstable.

A=Br. abortus M=Br. melitensis A/M=Br. abortus/melitensis CO2=CO2 sensitive. The Indian strains that were typed were recently isolated and, except the melitensis variant, were CO2 sensitive ; as might be expected the order of virulence proved to be as follows : melitensis most virulent; abortus/melitensis of intermediate virulence and abortus least virulent. As repeated subculturing is supposed to lead to loss of virulence, a comparison with the overseas type-specific strains must be undertaken with caution, in as much as the Maltese strain has been isolated for six years and the English abortus strain must be many years old. If, however, due allowance is made for this, the experiment suggests there is little difference between Indian and overseas variants. In order to check this suggestion, in Table XXX the Indian strains are compared with an average result of four recently isolated English Br. abortus strains typed by Priestley [1938] and, if it is to be believed that tests done by different persons can be at all comparable, the foregoing conception of virulence seems to be substantiated.

XVIII, PART III Technical notes For general information the following brief technical notes are appended. Routine cultures : Unless otherwise specified all day-to-day cultures and the monthly sub-cultures of the type collection have been made on liver agar pH 6-6 to 6-8 [Huddleson 1939]. Up to the present, it has not been possible to preserve cultures by desiccation in vacuo, other than experimental- ly. However, with the recent installation of the necessary apparatus at the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute it is hoped that the type collection can be so disposed in future. Isolation cultures : As long as tryptose has been available cultures intended for Brucella isolation have been made on tryptose (Difco)* agar or broth, (pH 6.9) otherwise liver media (pH 6.6 to 6.8) have been used. Routine tests : Before use, stock Brucella strains have always been tested for roughness; unless so specified, rough strains have not been used. Dye media : Crystal-violet-liver (or tryptose) agar (crystal violet 1/700,000) has been used for primary isolation, when there has been risk of much contamination. In this and in dye media in- hibition tests Grubler dyes have been used. Technique of isolation : When several strains have been isolated from the same herd, subsequent, attempts have been made by cultural methods only. When no previous strains have been obtained, culture and guinea-pig inoculation have both been used. The actual field technique used in securing specimens has been described elsewhere [Polding 1943]. SECTION V. DIAGNOSIS Amongst the several recognized ways of diagnosing Brucellosis, by far the most popular is the blood serum agglutination test. The intradermal test is the only other method receiving practical attention and great claims are made for it in the U.S.S.R.; but the double intradermal test entails the handling of animals thrice and a halt of four days to read a single test. The agglutination test, on the other hand, requires the handling of animals once and a halt of a few hours ; so that in the difficult touring conditions of India, and in dealing with the wild indigenous animal, the former method is much less practicable than the latter. In the present work, therefore, the agglutination reaction has been exclusively used, and, in the interests of uniformity, an effort has been made to introduce a standard all India tube agglutination test. The standard tube agglutination test Experience in Europe has incontravertibly shown that it is often far from easy to standardize a biological reaction, even one so uncomplicated as a straight agglutination test. It has been shown for example that an antigen prepared at one institute may differ considerably from that made at another although the same technique and bacterial strains are used. The first step in standardiza- tion, therefore, is the exclusive universal use of a single antigen prepared as far as possible by the same staff and in the same laboratory. In consequence, a carefully prepared antigen has been offered to the provinces by the Indian Veterinary Research Institute at production cost only. Obviously, such an antigen should be used in the particular modification of the technique of agglutination for which it is designed, and the interpretation of the test's results should be in accordance with a pre- determined schedule. A leaflet governing the use of the antigen is, therefore, obtainable from the Indian Veterinary Research Institute and has also been published [Polding 1943]. The tube agglutination test, as recommended by the Indian Veterinary Research Institute is believed to be the most critical and uniform that can be devised for routine work. Its use is urged, therefore, when an accurate diagnosis is required, that is to say, when a drastic decision, such as the disposal or slaughter of animals, depends on its result, or at other times when exact information is required. * Baird & Tatlock Ltd: London.
SEPTEMBER, 1948] JOHN B. POLDING 149 The theory and practice of the standard agglutination test is as follows: Antigen : Fundamentally, a Brucella antigen consists of a suspension of Brucella organisms in saline. It may therefore vary, (1) as to the character of the organisms used, (2) as to the density of the bacterial suspension, and (3) as to the concentration of NaCl in the vehicle. The character of the organisms employed is important in one outstanding respect; the strain must be smooth, but contrary to the belief of many in this country, it is not particularly important which variant is used, and some antigens are made from a combination of one, or more, strains of each of the variants abortus and melitensis, whilst others are prepared from a mixture of several strains of the same variant. In the present work, tests for variation in antigenic sensitivity have been made on numerous Indian and European strains (p. 146), and it has been found that, within the limits of experimental error, they all react to the same end-titre against a standard serum. Consequently, it does not appear to be very important from the point of view of origin, or type, which strain is selected, whilst the use of a multiplicity of strains complicates the work and leaves more loopholes for error. Actually, a single English Br. abortus strain is used for preparing standard abortus antigen and a single Maltese melitensis strain for making a melitensis antigen. The latter antigen has hitherto been offered merely to satisfy an apparent demand from persons wishing to make comparative tests, but it serves no useful purpose for antigens of either variant will react to approximately the same titre with their hetero- logous or homologous antisera. The density of an antigen is a matter of considerable importance, for variation of bacterial concentration will materially alter the end-point of a titration. In practice, antigens are encountered that vary from the transparency of water to nearly the turbidity of milk and while many complain of inconsistent results, there seems to be no satisfactory explanation why any individual adopts any particular density. The writer believes that a bacterial suspension should, in the first place, be sufficiently visible to make the detection of agglutination possible without the use of agglutinos- copes and for this, the final opacity, after dilution with serum, should not be much less than one half of the density of Brown's tube I. Secondly, within this limit, the density should be such as to be in nearly optimum proportion with the major antibody, when a serum is diluted to near its end- point. Some optimum proportion tests have been made to discover the antigenic density that gives an optimum reaction with serum, so diluted. In optimum proportion tests conducted near a serum's end-titre, the first appearance of agglutination is so trivial that the readings of different observers may disagree and the results of such tests must, therefore, be accepted cautiously. In each of the present tests, the selected dilution of serum was kept constant and the density of antigen varied. The systems were placed in a water-bath at 60°C. and observations were made at 5 minute intervals from the commencement of visible agglutination. The results of some of these tests are shown in Table (XXXI). The master titres of individual sera were obtained by testing them against antigen diluted to between tubes 1 and 2 of the Brown's scale. TABLE XXXI Optimum proportion tests of Brucella antigens Time Density of antigen* 5 &gt;4 &lt;4 3 2 &lt;2 1 &lt;1 ½ &lt;½ Serum (1) Stableforth's reconstructed serum, diluted 1/320 (titre +1/1280). 11.15 A.M. . . 150 Contagious Abortion of Cattle, Sheep and Goats [VOL. XVIII, PART III, TABLE XXXISEPTEMBER, 1948] JOHN B. POLDING 151 In all, 21 optimum proportion tests were made and, on the whole, the results confirmed that, no matter whether a weak, medium, or strongly positive serum was used, if tests are made with dilutions approaching the serum's end titre, the optimum primary density of antigen is slightly less than 1 on the Brown's scale. When, however, serum is diluted to considerably less than its end- titre, the density of antigen that gives optimum reaction is greater, i.e., near about a final dilution of 2 on the Brown's scale. Now, if it is agreed that an agglutination system should be most sensitive towards the end- point of a titration, these results show that antigen should be primarily diluted to about tube 1 on the Brown's scale. Its dilution when admixed with serum then becomes one half of tube 1 and it has been found that, when antigen is prepared to about this density, it agglutinates with Stable- forth's reconstructed serum in a dilution of about ++1/1280. Stableforth [1936] himself prepares antigen at a density of 4 on the Brown's scale and his end-point with reconstructed serum is +1/480. A third variable in antigen preparation is salt concentration. In the test being described, 12 per cent NaCl and 0.5 per cent phenol is used. A 12 per cent salt concentration is said to abolish zoning; it also ensures adequate self-mixing of the antigen and serum and does not appear to interfere with the test. Antigens are prepared as follows : The selected strain is tested for S-R change and smooth strains only are used. After this test, the strain is sown on liver agar and incubated for 48 to 72 hours at 37°C. The growth is then washed off in carbol saline (12 per cent NaCl, 0.5 per cent phenol) and the bacterial density reduced to between 2 and 3 on the Brown's scale. This suspension is again tested for S-R change. A sample of the bulk is then diluted 19 parts to 1 and 18 parts to 2 and so on, in 12 per cent saline and each dilution is tested against reconstructed serum in the primary dilutions of 1/320, 1/400, 1/480, 1/560 and 1/640. The density of antigen that agglutinates nearest to +1/1280 is selected and the bulk antigen diluted accordingly. Serum The collection, preservation, and transportation of serum for the agglutination test have already been described [Polding 1943]. In selecting the serum dilutions for the standard test the series 1/10, 1/20 etc. has been chosen, rather than the other popular range of 1/25, 1/50 etc. The initial primary dilution (1/5) of the former is easier to prepare than that of the latter (1/12½). Further, in the former range there are four closely spaced dilutions (1/10, 1/20, 1/40, 1/80) in the critical portion of the range, whilst in the latter there are but 3 (1/25, 1/50, 1/100). For these reasons the former range is more practical.* The quick agglutination test Antigen for the quick agglutination test as recommended in India is prepared exactly in the manner of Huddleson [1939]. The actual technique and interpretation of the test is, however, a simplification of his method [Polding 1943]. In a country like India, the value of the quick test, as a supplement to the tube test, is unqualified. For, whilst its results are somewhat subordinate to the personal judgement of the operator and are therefore only a rough guide to the incidence of Brucella infection, the virtues of the test are manifold, e.g., (i) the abolition of the need for sending field specimens to the laboratory with all the attendant difficulties, and delays, (ii) the obtaining of a diagnosis on the day of the visit to the field outbreak, and (iii) the cheapness and compactness of the apparatus required. On the other hand, on account of its lesser accuracy, the quick agglutination test is only recommended for use in rough village survey work, for making preliminary tests before taking specimens for the isolation of Brucella, and for simple diagnosis, when all that is required is to establish the existence of Brucellosis in a herd. More- over, this method can also provide valuable information in tests on fluids other than blood serum. For example, it is advantageous to quick-test the synovial fluid of bursal enlargements and the milk of aborting dams and only to attempt isolation of Brucella from these sources if their reaction is positive. Further, if time is available, it is advisable, in survey work, to quick-test the blood and milk of aborting anmals and the blood serum and synovial fluid of animals with bursal enlargements
152 Contagious Abortion of Cattle, Sheep and Goats [VOL. XVIII, PART III for, either of these fluids may be positive when the other is negative. A final important use of the quick-test is in vaccination work ; here, it is usually desirable to vaccinate Brucella negative animals only and, if tests are made by the tube method, the animals must be twice-handled, once for bleeding and once several days later for vaccination. A better method is to secure the animal and take 5.0 cc, of blood into a bottle containing a few drops of a 20 per cent solution of sodium citrate. The mixture is shaken and the whole-blood tested immediately. The animals which have not yet been released, may now be vaccinated, or not, according to the result. Using whole-blood in place of serum, the quick-test is rather more difficult to read and, unless the operator has great experience, some sort of reading box, such as described by Huddleson [1939], should be employed. But failing this the plate should at least be screened from the direct rays of the sun, which, coming from above, obscure the reading, for it is light from beneath the plate that is required if the flocculation is to be detected amongst the turbid blood. The accuracy of the agglutination test Different authorities have placed the accuracy of the serum agglutination test, variously between 65 and 95 per cent, and it is fairly well established that perhaps one-third of all Brucella infected animals are transitory reactors, if indeed they react at all. In Indian herds, it has generally been found that about 70 per cent of animals, aborting during a true epidemic, are Brucella positive, whilst, in one very severe primary epidemic, 95 per cent was recorded. When, however, a minor epidemic is prolonged into an endemic, such a high ratio is not always seen, e.g., of 38 crossbred cows aborting during the period 1935 to 1940 and tested early in 1941, but 14 (36 per cent), were Brucella positive. In such cases, it is clear that very few temporary reactors have been picked out by the test and that the reactions of a number of permanent reactors has subsided. Nevertheless, this does not entirely account for the scarcity of reactors amongst aborters, for, of the above animals nine aborted during 1940 and of them, but two (22 per cent), were positive. It seems probable, therefore, that at the end of an endemic period, or perhaps in some secondary epidemics, the presence of permanent reactors is greatly diminished. If whole herds, and not simply aborting animals, are considered, it appears that, when abortions are frequent, the incidence of reactors reflects to some extent the abortion rate, but when abortions are rare this relationship fails. In the early stages of sharp epidemics, when the abortion rate is in the order of 12 per cent to 15 per cent of the herd, the total percentage reactors in the herd will be from 45 to 60 and a number of animals are found to be infected that have not yet aborted. During a typical minor endemics, on the other hand, this rate is lower and was found, over an average of seven herds, to be 35 per cent. This last figure agrees exactly with that found by Doyle and Bechett [1936] in English cattle. The diagnostic titre of the aggiutination use has been much debated. In India, for example, it has been suggested that many indigenous cattle possess a week natural non-specific agglutination response to Brucella antigens, and that allowance should be made for this in diagnosis. But such a concept seems hardly tenable, for, in herds in which abortions do not occur, seldom a single animals can be found with even a doubtful reaction, whilst, in the comparatively disease-free districts of northwestern India, almost all the village animals that have been tested were strictly negative (p.117). On the other hand, in herds where abortions prevail, titres are usually quite high (1/320-1/2560) and sometimes very high (1/20,000), no matter the particular breed of cattle that is concerned. It is rarely difficult, therefore, to confirm an outbreak of Brucellosis by means of agglutination, but the diagnosis of infection in a single animal is only really informative when the test is positive. Opera- tors should, therefore, view a single suspect animal in conjunction with the herd, as a whole, taking into consideration the magnitude and duration of an epidemic, the influence of intercurrent disease and all relevant data such as clinical symptoms, susceptibility, and epidemiology. To assist in interpreting the agglutination test, a list of commonly accepted diagnostic standards has been published. [Stableforth 1936].
SEPTEMBER, 1948] JOHN B. POLDING 153 In buffaloes the position is entirely different, for, sometimes during primary epidemics of abortion in these animals, but 5-10 per cent dubious reactors can be found and it seems possible that some factor other than Brucellosis is at work. The aspect of specificity is discussed on (p. 188); here, it is important only to note that, if these primary epidemics amongst buffalo are indeed due to Brucellosis, then the agglutination test is wholly inadequate for their diagnosis. Tests of buffaloes, co-habiting with endemically infected cows, and themselves aborting spordical- ly, show that 25 per cent of buffaloes as opposed to 38 per cent of cows are Brucella positive. In one flare-up of an endemic amongst co-habiting cows and buffaloes, 12 per cent of each population aborted within a few months and, whereas 70 per cent of aborting cows were strongly positive but 48 per cent of buffaloes were weak reactors, and some 30 per cent were doubtful. In a herd of buffaloes suffering from a major Brucella epidemic (20 per cent abortions per annum), during the third year of the outbreak, at a time when some 60-70 animals had aborted, 25 per cent of the whole 215 animals were positive, while, three months later, a further 23 out of 152 previously negative animals had become so. In the fourth and fifth year of the endemic, about 50 per cent positive reactors were found. The highest positive incidence yet encountered in buffalo is 63 per cent of aborting animals in the fifth year of a fairly severe exacerbation of the disease. Finally, in the ordinary minor endemics of military farms, i.e., in cases where a trickle of abortion has been going on for years, the incidence of reactors is alike in cows and buffaloes (Table XXXII). TABLE XXXII The incidence of Brucella reactors in aborting cows and buffaloes in minor endemics on military establish- ments 154 Contagious Abortion of Cattle, Sheep and Goats [VOL. XVIII, PART III as prevalent as early as 1872 and by 1938 Benzone [1936] claims that, next to Malta, Italy is the most infected country in the world. At this time, the fever had become common even in the extreme north-western province of Piedmont, adjacent to the French frontier. Again the disease had been recognized in the Iberian peninsula as far back as 1759. France, therefore, has been threatened along two landward approaches and it is significant that during the decade of the thirties, the two main endemic areas of that country were along the marches of the Pyrenees and a deep area lying vis-a-vis the Piedmont frontier. [Taylor, Lisbonne, Vidal and Hazeman 1938.] In 1938, these two endemic zones had not quite become confluent in the department of Aude on the gulf of Lyons. Moreover, the remoter sheep-populated departments of Eure et Loire and Seine et Marne and the western goat-populated department of Deux et Sevres have hitherto been disease-free. The infection has, however, spread along the Franco-Swiss frontier, or more probably through Switzerland itself, into the goat-breeding departments of Meuse, Moselle, Rhin and Vosges and so, into south-western Germany. Eyre [1936] defined the limit of its spread at the 46th parallel of latitude N., but by this date or a little later, the 50th parallel had almost been reached. It has been suggested that infection was carried from the Mediterranean region to the new world via the milk goats of the conquistadores. On the Mediterranean littoral itself, other places known to be infected are Greece, Asia Minor, Algeria, Tunisia, Lybia, Palestine and Egypt, whilst further south some infection is probable in Transjordania, Erytrea, Tanganyika, Iran, Iraq, Aden, Somali- land and possibly the Cape (Fig. 13). Melitensis infection has also been described as far east as Singapore and Manchuria. It is evident, therefore, that in certain circumstances this disease can disseminate with ease, and it would be indeed extraordinary had not infection in some way penetrated into India. From the year of Wright's and Semple's [1897] demonstration of the agglutination test for Brucellosis up to the time of the famous revelations of the Mediterranean Fever Commission [1905-07], report after report was published of undulant fever in this country. A crescendo was reached in 1907 and then very little more was heard of human infection in India. It is remarkable that, with the crude facilities and technique of those times, officers were apparent- ly able to isolate Br. melitensis with ease and certainty wherever they tried, viz., from 11 humans in Multan and Ferozepore [Lamb ; 1906] and from goats again in Ferozepore [Forster ; 1906] and that numerous positive and typical cases were described from all over India. Indeed, a perusal of the journals of that era must have forced contemporary readers to assume that melitensis fever was endemic in certain military cantonments with the inference that the Punjab, at least, was widely infested. Amongst the numerous places alleged to be infected were Ferozepore, Multan, Rawal- pindi, Murree, Nowshera, Peshawar, and Mian Mir. Furthermore, scrutiny of these records cannot fail to impress the critical reader with the fact that a gram-negative, non-CO2 sensitive, cocco-baccillus, which was agglutinated by Brucella specific serum, was indeed being isolated from humans suffering from clinical undulant fever. Moreover, that Co2 was not required to isolate these strains is reasonable proof that they were the variant melitensis. On the other hand, agglutination reactions were, on the whole, weak and a demonstration of infection in animals was infrequent and applied to a few cantonment-goats only. From 1907 onwards, the spate of case reports suddenly subsides until at the present day it is difficult to obtain more than very rare reports of single cases of undulant fever in humans in India. But this surprising state of affairs can only be explained by one of three propositions, viz., (1) that the earlier reports were wholly incorrect (2) that in the period 1907-1939 human Brucellosis in India has p actically died out, or (3) that undulant fever still occurs frequently and it is either not reported, or not diagnosed. The earlier work must either be disbelieved as a whole, thus discrediting the work of several specialist officers, or accepted as a whole ; whilst at the present time, it is past belief that, frequent cases of so serious a disease as melitensis infection, could be missed in modern army hospitals. In the face of this, explanation must be sought in the rather improbable proposition 2.
SEPTEMBER, 1948] JOHN B. POLDING 155 Now it is queer, to say the least of it, that case reports in India subsided so soon after 1907, the very year succeeding that in which the infection rate in the British garrison at Malta was so greatly and dramatically reduced. But nearly all the cases of genuine Malta fever reported in India, occurred in cantonments and in the words of Scott [1939]. The disease was shown to be widespread in north-west India and especially in places where British troops were stationed. (The italics are the present writer's.) Can it be accepted then, that infection in Indian cantonments was brought by trooping movements from Malta, that dissemination from the human vector was purely localized, and, to round off the premise, that when fresh sources of infection from Malta failed, the local endemics, in the absence of a sufficient animal reservoir and possibly in the face of stricter boiling of milk, partially, or wholly died out ? During the present investigation constant attempts have been made to stimulate medical interest in Brucellosis ; but it has been rightly contended that, during the wartime emergency, little effort could be spared for a disease of such apparent minor importance as Brucellosis. This branch of the work has, therefore, been considerably handicapped by the unavoidable circumstances of war. Nevertheless, it is of deep epidemiological interest why a disease, so prevalent in man living on the goat populated Mediterranean littoral, should be apparently so rare in man in India ; where, in certain parts at least, sheep and goats are bred abundantly. At one time the simple explanation of the almost universal Indian custom of the boiling of milk was stressed as the explanation but, in France, Taylor, et al [1938] has clearly shown that amongst goat and sheep-breeders, at least, and possibly also amongst all who come in close contact with these animals such as stall-holders, house- wives, and butchers probably 40-60 per cent of infection is transmitted to man, by contact. For a considerable section of the Indian public, therefore, the boiled-milk explanation fails and, if it can be assumed that Brucellosis in man would be diagnosed and reported were it a sufficiently prevalent- disease in this country, an assumption which is probably valid then it appears that, the reason for its rareness in man, must be its rareness in animals ; or, more remotely, that the conditions for contact- transmission prevailing in France are absent in India. As for animals, occasional verified Br. melitensis strains seem to have been isolated in the Punjab and it is possible, therefore, that the disease has indeed reaohed this country probably via Persia or by sea from Malta. Nevertheless, it has been shown earlier in this paper that Brucellosis is rare in Indian sheep and goats, that indeed the only places where a regular, if low, incidence of reactors can be traced in these animals are in south India, where they are cohabiting with abortus infected indigenous cows. In the north-west, on the other hand, reactors are almost entirely absent. The inference is, that, as in man, so in sheep and goats Brucellosis is uncommon in India. The whole position, therefore, appears to be one of disease transmission and the probable reason why Br. melitensis infection is rare, in man and animals alike, is because the main reservoir of near-Asia is shut off from India by vast expanses of sparsely populated sun-scorched desert and arid vegeta- tionless hills. At the same time, even the trace infection that has so far reached the north of India is barely able to survive in the destructive climate of the Thar desert and valley of the Indus. Nevertheless, looking back on the section on transmission it seems sufficiently clear that, if enough infection can traverse the Thar desert southwards then Br. melitensis infection might become an important endemic in south and central India. A second means by which melitensis infection might reach south India is through the personnel of the fourth Indian division, which might have contracted sufficient undulant fever during its cam- paign in the Mediterranean to disseminate the disease after demobilization. In this respect, it must be recalled that man may eliminate Brucella organisms in the urine for months, or even years, after primary infection. Br. melitensis is not, however, the sole Brucella variant pathogenic to man, and it seems possible that a variable number of Indians must become infected with Br. abortus by contact with infected animals.

XVIII, PART III to time, notably in the North West Frontier Province and the Punjab, but, until the responsible strain is isolated, it will not be known whether these fevers are melitensis or abortus in type. In the endemic areas of south India, the behaviour of the indigenous A/M strain in man would be of particular interest. During the last several years six or seven cases of undulant fever have been described at the King George V hospital, Vizagapatam [Pandalai and Raman 1941]. Regrettably such strains as were isolated from these cases were discarded untyped, but, in the writer's opinion they were probably A/M in character. In view of the practice of boiling milk and the peculiar climatic conditions of south India, it would also have been of great interest to have discovered the incidence of Brucellosis in man in the village endemic areas of the peninsula. In consequence, a list of infected districts (Table XXXIII) was given to the medical authorities, who, in their turn, addressed a questionnaire to the local doctors concerned. From all districts the reply was that no undulabing-type of fever was encountered in humans; but that, in future, undiagnozed cases of pyrexia would be tested for Brucellosis.

Orissa These replies are about the some of the information that can be obtained at present and, on the whole, it appears that, if the disease occurs at all, and it would be surprising if it did not, then it does so within insufficient severity or frequency to make itself noticeable to the local medical authorities. When the disease is due to abortus strains, symptoms are often so slight, that in view of the numerous transient undiagnozed fevers, which are either attributed to malaria, or treated empirically and are always regarded as commonplace, it would not be surprising if most cases were overlooked. Un- dulant fever due to melitensis infection, on the other hand, is usually severe and it is hardly possible that in army circles, at any rate, it would pass undiagnozed. It must be conceded, therefore, that melitensis infection of man must be relatively rare in India, but that an unknown amount of infection with the abortus or abortus/melitensis strains may pass unnoticed in south India. This view is support- ed by the admission in reply to the above-mentioned questionnaire that undiagnozed fevers do exist in Brucella endemic tracts of south India. In view of what has just been written concerning the climatic barrier of Persia and near-Asia to the eastward migration of melitensis into India, the question might aptly be asked, why this infec- tion continues to be so prevalent on the arid and sun drenched Mediterranean seaboard ? As far as man is concerned the custom of drinking unboiled milk is, to the writer's knowledge, universal amongst the uneducated Maltese, and this probably holds good throughout most of the northern littoral. Infection in the goat, therefore, ensures infection in man. As for the goat, this animal breeds seasonally kidding as a rule in February, March and April and although the Mediterra- nean is generally supposed to be arid, this season, at least, is one of extreme cold and violent rainstorms.
SEPTEMBER, 1948] JOHN B. POLDING 157 SECTION VII158 Contagious Abortion of Cattle, Sheep and Goats [VOL. XVIII, PART III of a drained cement floor surrounded by six-foot brick walls, cemented on the inside to the top. A simple roof, carried on poles projecting four or five feet above the walls and with everhanging eves, completes the structure. The entrance does not require a door and may be closed by bars fitting in slots, whilst drainage should be carried onto cultivated land so as to be inaccessible to cattle. The size and number of boxes or paddocks are matters for some deliberation; if it is uncommon for more than one or two recently aborting animals to be on the farm at one time, then a single box or paddock with accommodation for two will be sufficient, but, as it is not desirable to place more than two or at the most three recently aborting animals in the same paddock or box, when abortions are more frequent, proportional accommodation must be arranged. In fixing this, it must be borne in mind that the longest continuous period a single animal will be in isolation is 60 days. The periods during which Brucella infected animals should be isolated in these premises are as follows: (1) From the first signs of abortion or premature delivery until 60 days after the act of delivery. (2) All cows isolated under (i) from about three weeks before the anticipated date of the sub- sequent parturition, or from the time of second abortion or premature delivery should it occur. (N.B.SEPTEMBER, 1948] JOHN B. POLDING 159 vaccination can be defended on the ground of safety, for, the longer the period between vaccination and parturition the less the chance of bacterial dissemination at calving. But although the Americans suggest that the optimum age for immunization is 4 to 8 months, many believe that they have not proved their case [McEwen 1941]. It is well known, for example, that very young calves are naturally strongly immune and that this immunity is entirely lost by puberty, and without experimental proof it is difficult to believe that a weak immunity, conferred by a low-virulent strain, at 4 to 8 months of age will survive into the first or second calving; it is nonetheless possible, that by vaccinating between 4 to 8 months, i.e., when the natural immunity of calfhood is beginning to fade, the animals are caught at the most suitable moment for re-immunization. A very large scale trial of this system is at present being made in United States. On the whole the results of first calvings seemed promising, but at the second calving they were less so. In this connection it has been rightly pointed out that, as heifers are usually kept separate from the adult herd during their first pregnancy, they are much less exposed to infection than second calvers who spend a whole pregnancy in contact with infected adults. In England, McEwen has worked in great detail along parallel lines, and, by artificial passage has produced from an almost a virulent parent strain (No. 45), two sub-strains [No. 45 (6) and No. 45(20)] each of rather greater virulence than its predecessor [McEwen 1940]. He has also developed one or two systems of measuring virulence (p. 146) and has further shown that a strain's immunizing value is proportional to its virulence. With reason, therefore, he suggests that a vaccine strain should be of the greatest possible degree of virulence, short of its being virulent enough to cause generalized infection in cattle; he adds that to achieve and maintain this degree, in practice, is not at all easy ; McEwen favours the vaccination of heifers and his strain No. 45(20), being rough, does not invoke an agglutination response in the recipient, which is an advantage, as confusion over blood tests need not arise. Very many trials have been made of vaccines prepared from either Cotton's or McEwen's strains, and, whilst the results have not been uniformly favourable, there is an overall indication that some measure of protection can be obtained from their use. THE CHARACTER OF THE VACCINES USED IN INDIA Cotton's strain No. 19, McEwen's Nos. 45, 45(6) and 45(20) together with another similar strain Huddleson's No. 805 have been brought to this country and have been tested for virulence under Indian conditions. As Cotton's and Huddleson's strains were brought out at the commencement of the scheme, they have been tested more thoroughly than McEwen's which were received much later. Owing to a shortage of funds and accommodation, it was not possible to conduct controlled tests on these strains in adult buffaloes, zebu and crossbreds as was manifestly desirable. Experiments have been made, therefore, in crossbred calves, goats, guinea-pigs and white mice. Examination of vaccine strains Test I. Cotton's strain No. 19 and Huddleson's 805, having been in the writer's possession for a very long period, were examined as to their general characteristics. They were found to be typical Br. abortus, to be smooth and of standard antigenic sensitivity. Test II. Strains 19 and 805 were examined for their virulence in guinea-pigs. The guinea-pigs received 3500 × 106 organisms in 1.0 c.c. of saline in the manner shown in Table XXXIV where the animals' subsequent serum responses are also recorded. The guinea-pigs were killed on the 35th day and the liver, spleen and kidneys of each animal were plate-cultured. Brucella organisms did not appear on any of these cultures. Test III. The pathogenicity of Cotton's No. 19, Huddleson's 805 and a recently-isolated, CO2 sensitive, Indian-field-strain, out of a buffalo, was compared in goats. The virulent control

The blood of these goats was cultured at various intervals (Table XXXVII) and it was found that the virulent strain produced a bacteraemia in all three of its recepients, whereas no bacteraemia was demonstrable in members of either group receiving the vaccine strain.

The effect of varying doses of Cotton's strain 19 was tested in crossbred calves, aged 4-8 months. Inoculations were given subcutaneously to pairs of calves, in doses of 800, 4,000, 8,000 and 40,000 million organisms, in saline. The resultant temperature reactions appeared to be un- affected by the magnitude of the dose, all of them reaching a peak of about 104° to 105° F on the second day, after which, they fell rapidly to normal. A hard and fairly painful swelling reaching a maximum on the third day and disappearing in about a week developed at the site of injection. The animals continued to feed and appeared otherwise unaffected by the injection. All calves res- ponded with a high serum reaction which peaked about the 12th day with titres in the order of +/SEPTEMBER, 1948] JOHN B. POLDING 163 the relative virulence of the three principal ones is fairly accurately portrayed in Table XXIX. If then the immunizing value of a strain is indeed proportional to its virulence, and, if a single strain only is to be used, plainly either McEwen's No. 45(20), or Cotton's No. 19, should be selected as being of the highest virulence consistant with safety. If however, the use of a combination of strains or even two injections is contemplated, then the choice becomes more difficult and trials would have to decide, whether to give a strain of low virulence followed by one of greater or whether some other combination was preferable. There is an enormous field of research in which to decide (i) the opti- mum age, or sexual phase, at which to inject cattle with164 Contagious Abortion of Cattle, Sheep and Goats [VOL.

In an earlier experiment (Table XL) counts, made on vaccines sent to the Military Veterinary Laboratory, Lahore, stored for varying periods at average temperatures of 71° and 77°F. and returned to Mukteswar, compared very unfavourably with counts on a control vaccine stored at a constant 79°F. in the Institute. Therefore, as temperature alone was clearly not to blame, it appeared that death might have been due to (i) changes in temperature during transit or (ii) shaking during transit. In experiment V, Cotton's strain 19 was suspended at density 5 (Brown's scale) in the optimum vehicle evolved in Experiments I to IV (i.e., 0.85 per cent NaCl in glass-distilled water, buffered with M/50 Sorensen's phosphates to pH 6.4, with the addition of 0.1 per cent tryptose). This suspension was divided into three parts ; one portion was stored continuously at 42°C., a second sample was moved from one incubator to another, so as to vary the temperature of storage as much as possible, whilst roughly imitating the diurnal temperature changes on the plains (see schedule on the reverse of Fig. 9.) A third sample was shaken from 10 a.m. to 4-30 p.m. and throughout the night was stored at 42°C. without agitation. The shaking was achieved by placing the suspension in a bottle which contained 3 parts of air and 1 part of vaccine and attaching the bottle to a rotor moving in a plane set at approximately 30° to the vertical. In this way the vaccine was precipitated from end to end of the bottle, twice in each revolution. The speed of rotation was 120-150 r.p.m. As may be seen from an inspection of Fig. 9, the bacterial death-rate was not strikingly affected by shaking and not at all by variations in temperature. A puzzling result, for not only is it at variance with the inference drawn from the mortality occurring during transit in India, but it also disagrees with the findings of Mitchell and Moore [1942], who, by means of counts taken before and after various journies, de- monstrated the lethal effect of trnasportation on Brucella. Nevertheless, it must be recalled that in the foregoing experiment the control remained for the whole time at 42°C. whilst, during the shaking periods, the shaken sample was at bench temperature. Thus, as the two mortalities are almost the same, it is to be supposed that bacterial destruction due to shaking at say 22° to 25°C. equals that due to storage at 42°C. Moreover in this experiment the
SEPTEMBER, 1948] JOHN B. POLDING 169 optimum vehicle was used, whilst the vaccine sent to Lahore was made with saline. Accordingly, two more experiments were made. In the first, a saline control was kept continuously at 42°C and both an optimum and a saline sample were shaken, as before (during the day at room temperature and stored during the night at 42°C). Another saline sample instead of being shaken was jerked. Jerking was arranged by securing the bottle containing the vaccine to a strip of copper sheet anchored at one end only ; the free end of the strip was within reach of a four armed rotor (r.p.m.=150) adjusted so that each arm struck the sheet in passing. The sheet thus became a slow vibrator and transmitted vibrations to the vaccine in a manner reminiscent of railway-travel in India. In this experiment, the greatest death-rate occurred in the saline control; the least in the opti- mum shaken sample, whilst after the first 24 hours the comparative rate in the jerked saline sample was considerable (Fig. 10). In the other experiment (Fig. 11), a saline suspension was kept at bench temperature conti- nuously, while a saline and an optimum sample were shaken at the same temperature without inter- ruption for 72 hours. In this experiment there was a noticeably greater death-rate in both the shaken samples than in the control. A review of the preceding work forces the conclusion that temperature of storage, age and agitation cause Brucella vaccines to deteriorate and while the greatest individual contribution to- wards this end is undoubtedly temperatures higher than about 70°F. the cumulative effect of all is very considerable. Further, in all tests, the optimum substrate evolved in the earlier work proved slightly better in most environments, and very much better in extreme environments than did the saline. Therefore, the technique recommended for the preparation and issue of Brucella vaccines in India is as follows. The vaccine strain is to be sown on liver agar pH 6.8-7.0 and incubated for 48 to 72 hours at 37°C. The growth is then to be washed off in a small measured quantity of optimum vehicle (say 25 c.c. per roux flask). The yield from sufficient flasks is pooled (one flask is generally sufficient to produce 100 to 150 c.c. of finished vaccine) and a small sample of the pool is tested to get the dilution factor required to give a density of tube 5 or 6 on the Brown's scale. The pool is diluted accordingly and bottled. Where possible, vaccine should not be issued between April and September, but, if it must be used during this period, not more than 7 to 10 days should elapse between the despatch from Muktes- war and the cancellation date marked on the bottle. In winter, when routine vaccination should be practiced, a period of validity of three weeks might be permitted, but, in every event, the instruc- tions should urge the earliest possible use of the vaccine. It is also permissible to store vaccine at Mukteswar at zero degrees C. for one or two months between preparation and issue; it may be noted further, that the easily obtained and less costly gelatin may be substituted for tryptose in the preparation of the optimum vehicle. THE PRESENT POLICY OF VACCINATION IN INDIA At present, vaccination against Brucellosis is recommended when eradication by hygienic control seems improbable, or it has been tried and failed. As a general guide, vaccination need only be considered when farms have an abortion rate of more than 5 per cent of the breeding stock per annum and conditions adverse to hygiene control (p. 157) exist. The class of stock to be vaccinated may be selected to suit local convenience, the primary object being to protect all healthy females both existent and to come. The first group of vaccinees that usually presents itself is existing uninfected adults and, because these must be inoculated when not in-calf, the work becomes troublesome as it entails the vaccination of two or three cows at a time as they accumulate after calving. It usually also means vaccinating in-milk animals, which causes a small but not, it is to be noted, permanent drop in the milk-yield. Therefore, if only a few uninfected adults remain in a herd, it is for considera- tion, whether it is worthwhile vaccinating them. Where, however, a number remains, vaccination

There remain two other groups of possible vaccinees, viz., heifers, which become eligible for inoculation at any time during the six months preceding the anticipated age of first oestrus, and calves between 4 to 8 months of age. It is for decision which of the classes, both now, and in the future are going to be most convenient to vaccinate and, in deciding this, the following points should be borne in mind : (1) that calves are more easily handled than heifers182 Contagious Abortion of Cattle, Sheep and Goats [VOL. XVIII, PART III attempt to get results, but records, other than a very rough statement derived from the village spokes- man, will probably never be available. Turning to farms, one private recorded herd was vaccinated as early as November of 1941 and here alone is it possible to review the results of two completed breeding seasons. The vaccinated animals were mainly empty adult Punjabi buffaloes and the injection consisted of 50 thousand million organisms of Cotton's strain 19, suspended in 5.0 c.c. of saline. A single dose was given subcutaneously. The abortion rate for the six prevaccination years 1936-41 can be seen on page 131 in (Table XXI) ; the rate since 1941 is given in (Table XLIII).

Nevertheless, it is debateable how much this drop is due to the vaccination and how far it may be attributed to a natural cessation of the endemic. Unfortunately, a study of the abortion rates in the various groups reveals little, for, while it is true that the principal vaccinees show one third less abortions than the controls, the rates in all other groups are uniformatively alike, worse still, the rates in the very large batches of unvaccinated animals were very much lower than the lowest rate for the preceding six years. It is hard to believe that the protection of 77 animals so reduced the concentration of disseminable contagion that most of the remaining 150 or so animals escaped infection, and the result is as bewil- dering scientifically, as it is gratifying in practice. At the most, but a poor case can be made out for the vaccine, while, there is much to suggest that the endemic might well have ended spontaneously ; for instance, no new buffaloes had been purchased for some three or four years, while the home-bred new-entry were few. It is easy to suppose, therefore, that after a 20 per cent abortion rate for six years much of the herd had become naturally immune. However, as a result of renewed confidence inspired by the fewer abortions, the owners are buying 100 new adults in 1944 ; these animals are to be vaccinated and the real test will come when they commence to breed. Another fairly large scale trial of vaccination has been made in the young cow-stock of five military farms Animals were inoculated in two age groups viz., at 4 to 8 months and 18 to 24 months respectively. A single subcutaneous injection was given of 5.0 c.c. of Cotton's strain 19 suspended at a density of 7 to 8 on the Brown's scale. As yet, insufficient results have accumulated to permit the formation of an opinion on this work, but such records as are available are analyzed in Table XLIV, p. 183. They are at present unworthy of discussion.

XVIII, PART III SECTION VIII. SPECIFIC ABORTION, OTHER THAN BRUCELLOSIS (Abortions caused by specific primary genita infection, other than Brucellosis) During the course of the scheme, a constant vigilance has been maintained for evidence of specific primary genital infections, which, Brucellosis apart, are known to cause abortion ; those commonly described are (i) Trichomoniasis, (ii) Listerellosis, (iii) Vibrio infections, (iv) Salmonella infections, to which may be added one or two bacterial diseases suspected of having the occasional ability of causing abortion. It may be said at once that, in India, no epidemic abortion has been encountered which could be attributed to any of these infections ; but the following notes on each are appended. Trichomoniasis Infection by T. foetus has been suspected in occasional cases of bovine abortion or sterility in south India. Suspicions have generally been aroused by the co-existence of purulent vaginal dis- charges with abortionSEPTEMBER, 1948] JOHN B. POLDING 185 they have been very scantily examined. Again, on account of the extreme difficulty of obtaining pregnant goats for animal-inoculations and of preventing the few obtained from dying of pneumonia in the rigours of the Kumaun winter, the results of animal passage are too few to be convincing, For what they are worth, however, they are very briefly appended. The organism is a small gram-positive cocco-bacillus or bacillus, reminiscent of the short form of Lis- terella, but, unlike Listerella, long forms have not yet been observed and pleomorphism is slight. The organism is believed to be sluggishly motile, but growth is so feeble at bench temperatures that ins- pection during the first 72 hours is almost fruitless. Spores are not formed. Growth at 37°C is almost equally problematical in broth or on agar and unless strains are passaged every three days they will sooner or later be lost. ACO2 atmosphere does not improve matters. Comparative growth has been observed on 2 per cent tryptose agar, liver agar, and 1 per cent glucose agar and in 2 per cent tryptose and 2 per cent, 1 per cent and 0.5 per cent glucose broth. One per cent glucose seems to be very much better than other concentrations while 2 per cent tryptose is a very good substitute. On solid media, colonies are pin-point to small pin-head, translucent, sparkling and beadlike. They neither enlarge with time nor tend to coalesce. So far, isolation cultures have shown sparce colony growth only. The continuous growth, seen on established cultures, is so faint as to be only discernable by the closest scrutiny, while manipulating the slant in transmitted light. For a day or two, it appears as little more than a faint fogging on the surface of the agar, which may be confused with a patch of dried condensation. This wraith-like appearance on solid media is characteristic and although well- established strains occasionally get slightly denser, as a rule, the culture dies before it can thicken. The growth in broth produces a uniform faint turbidity, part of which, in well established cultures, deposits in the form of light flakes. On none of the media used, can growth be expected before the second or third day of incubation and even well adapted strains may fail to emerge before the fourth. At any time a strain may die for no apparent reason and to obviate this mishap it is desirable to maintain cultures in 2 per cent tryptose or 1 per cent glucose broth and to subculture twice weekly by pipetting a substantial quantity from the old to the new tube. Before this system was developed several promising lines186 Contagious Abortion of Cattle, Sheep and Goats [VOL. XVIII, PART III Both strains were non-pathogenic for mice, guinea-pigs, and rabbits ; thus again differing from Listerella ; but in pregnant goats one or two pathogenic effects were noted that can hardly be ignored. They are schematized in Table (XLVI). TABLE XLVI The injection of pregnant goats with X strains Goat No. Inoculum and route Results 380 X.39 (5.0 c.c. of a 48 hours broth culture, intravenously).

Out of six pregnant goats receiving viable X strains, only one remained unaffected (No. 341) while three aborted and four died. From three affected goats an X-like strain was recovered in pure culture, in each case from the genital tissues. The remarkable and baffling point is that two of the three abortions occurred within 48 hours of the administration of the injection ; in one case in the night following and in the other during the second night following inoculation. It is scarcely believ- able that these early abortions could be the direct result of bacterial invasion, but it is perhaps possible that this organism is a fairly common inhabitant of the goat and that the injections precipitated a crisis of an otherwise subclinical infection. In this respect it has already been noted, how little is required to provoke a goat to abortion. It is perhaps unfortunate that no tissues of the dead goats, other than genital, were cultured. Pneumonia is fairly common in goats and at that time it was not associated with the injections. In retrospect, however, it does not seem improbable the X organism may have been a cause of the pneumonia, and in fact be concerned in goat pneumonia in general. On
SEPTEMBER, 1948] JOHN B. POLDING 187 the present evidence it would be folly to suggest, that a new cause of goat abortion has been discovered, but it does seem desirable that when future cases of obscure epizootic goat abortion are being investi- gated, organisms of the type described should be diligently sought. Further, in view of some of the similarities between goat and buffalo abortion, it is not impossible that X strains might be encountered in the latter species also, SECTION IX. NON-SPECIFIC ABORTION (Abortions not demonstrably caused by specific primary genital infection) Cows Although non-specific bovine abortion is infrequent in India, in almost every herd, occasional abortions occur that are not due to obvious disease. The incidence of such casualties is from 0.5 per cent to 2.0 per cent per annum, their appearance is sporadic and their cause is difficult to discover, Many attribute these abortions to injuries received in fights, to careless driving through door-ways and gates and to slipping in railway waggons or on ill-faced cow-house floors. Such explanations are plausible, but the fact remains that a perfectly healthy cow is capable of sustaining a considerable amount of rough handling (e.g., in casting) without aborting ; whilst, if the analogy be tenable, a mare far advanced in pregnancy, may roll for hours in colic and fail to abort. Plant-poisoning is another favourite retreat of the baffled diagnostician, but, whenever this explanation has been proffered during the present work and where malpractice could be ruled out, the writer has not known a single instance supported by scientifically acceptable proof, while, in the cases where the fodder has been analyzed, the reports have always shown it to be harmless. How- ever, in one occurrence of- several abortions in a jail herd in Bengal, malpractice was definitely sus- pected, firstly because all abortions occurred outside the jail wall, in an easily accessible place, secondly because most of the animals died during delivery, and thirdly because pregnant animals of the same batch taken inside the jail failed to abort. The local authorities suggested that there was a plant known in the district which if administered to cattle caused poisoning and abortion, whilst another possibility is trauma caused by inserting sticks or other objects per vaginam. As, however, the cases were apparently not very carefully examined at the time of the occurrence, the real explanation will probably never be known. Whatever the cause, it is quite out of the ordinary for a majority of animals to die from an apparently uncomplicated outbreak of abortion and this can be regarded as a unique and irrelevant incident. A far more genuine cause of abortion in which the genitalia are not primarily involved, is an attack of a severe infection such as rinderpest, or foot-and-mouth disease, and although the sequel of abortion is not so common in cows, as in buffaloes, sheep and goats, one clear case was encountered during the present work. A combined attack of rinderpest and hæmorrhagic septicaemia appeared to be the inciting stimulus, the abortions occurring nearly simultaneously in several Brucella-free convalescents. There seems good reason to suppose therefore, that many otherwise inexplicable abortions could be attributed to previous sickness or physical upset were the history of the case but known. Deficiencies of diet have often been suggested as causes of abortion and conjectures of this sort again provide a smoke-screen for ignorance. It is a truism that abortions are commonest in scienti- fically fed herds and rarest amongst half-starved village animals. This may perhaps be explained on the grounds that scientifically fed animals are also almost always forced, whereas, the village cow can adjust her output to changes of environment. Nevertheless, although several workers have more or less associated a deficiency of various food factors with abortion, it has yet to be shown that, in ordinary circumstances, the lack of any particular item of diet has caused wholesale abortion in an otherwise healthy herd. That certain deficiencies, coupled with forcing, may predispose to infec- tion is by no means questioned, but academic proportions such as these must be placed on a rather more practical basis before they can be treated seriously in Indian field practice. K
188 Contagious Abortion of Cattle, Sheep and Goats [VOL. XVIII, PART III, Buffaloes Throughout part I, constant allusion has been made to certain peculiarities of buffalo abortion whose specificity was held in question. The salient points recapitulated are (i) sharp epidemics of buffalo abortion can often be connected with preceding heavy rains, (ii) when these epidemics are primary and where the buffaloes are not co-habiting with cattle, it is unusual to find more than a few doubtful Brucella reactors amongst the affected buffaloes, (iii) in exacerbations of minor ende- mics, when buffaloes are co-habiting with Brucella-infected cattle, the reactor rate in buffaloes is about half of that in cattle and the serum titres of the buffaloes are low compared with those of the cows, (iv) towards the end of prolonged outbreaks of abortion in buffaloes Brucella reactor rates have been noted equal to the normal rate in cows irrespective of whether the buffaloes are with cows or not, (v) buffaloes seem slow to contract Brucellosis from co-habiting cows, (vi) at least one epidemic of buffalo abortion has been investigated in which unusual symptoms have been noted. It seems that these anomalies can be explained by one of three postulates, viz., (1) that the abortions are the result of some effect of the rain, e.g., chill, of depression (2) that they are caused by an atypically manifested Brucellosis, exascerbated by rain, (3) that they are due to an unknown rain-invoked infection. The possibility of the chilling effect of rain being the unaided cause of abor- tion seems, at first sight, remote, for there is usually a lag period of some weeks between the rains and the epidemic. As, however, a similar lag is sometimes observed when abortions are plainly the sequel of fevers, this possibility cannot be entirely discarded. Indeed, on deeper enquiry, this postulate becomes more attractive, in as much as the two species in which unexplicable abortions connected with rains occur, are the buffalo and the goat, animals which are liable to be severely affected by chilling. It might be further argued that continuous rainfall enhances this effect by depressing the buffalo's very sensitive metabolism over long periods. Brucellosis could be accepted as the cause, were Brucella reactors constantly and adequately present in all epidemics, and the part played by the rain could be explained by the hypothesis of ' a better infective dose being transmitted by fluids ' (p. 134). But, if, in the face of so many poor agglutination reactions, an aetiology of Brucellosis is insisted upon, then it must be conceded that, in primary outbreaks, the Brucella agglutination response of buffaloes is bad. There is considerable data to be found throughout this paper which adds support to this supposition ; furthermore, it is irrefutable that Brucellosis is at least intercurrent in many epidemics, and, while, in this disease, the carrier-role of fluids seems a reasonable one, the preserving value of humidity on the contagion has been demonstrated. Finally, if neither of the preceding suppositions be tenable, then certain sporadic primary out- breaks of buffalo abortion must be due to an unknown waterborne infection, for this is the only other solution which fits the facts. Nevertheless, it remains a solution without an aetiology, and to de- monstrate the difficulty of securing evidence of another causal factor the following case report is cited. In an epidemic of abortions among buffaloes co-habiting with and presumably infected by cattle, the Brucella reactor rate in buffaloes was half that of the cows, the rate in the cows being normal. In the buffaloes only, there were the following symptoms, which disagreed with the Brucella syndrome, (1) abortions occurred much earlier in pregnancy than was normal for Brucella infected buffaloes, i.e., at three months term (2) a proportion of buffaloes were emitting a purulent vaginal discharge, (3) a few necrotic ulcers the size of a shilling were seen on the vaginal mucosa. Sabotage, plant- poisoning and the sequel of vaccinations or febrile infections could be ruled out. The vaginal secre- tions were examined for protozoa by the usual means and for bacterial infection by numerous small animal injections and direct cultures. But no pathogen, including the Brucella microbe, could be found. It is to be noted that the outbreak was preceded about one month earlier by exceptional rains. For the present, therefore, it is not possible to adjudicate between the three hypothesis, and plainly, experiment should determine the true course of Brucellosis in buffaloes and the effect of their
SEPTEMBER, 1946] JOHN B. POLDING 189 being chilled while pregnant. At the same time, further field investigation is needed in search of the postulated pathogen. In the face of so much incertitude it is pleasant to be able to recall that buffaloes are definitely known to abort after an attack of a severe fever or systemic disturbance, e.g., rinderpest, antirinderpest injections, haemorrhagic septicemia, or foot and mouth disease and the likelihood that they are more liable to this accident than cows adds credence to the conjecture that abortions may be also caused by chilling during rainfall. Sheep and goats Although abortion due to Brucellosis seems to be quite rare in the village sheep and goats of India, abortion associated with extra-genital disease is common. Indeed it seems possible that these animals will abort as the result of any disease which seriously impairs their health, e.g., pneumonia, rinderpest or rinderpest pneumonia, contagious pleuro-pneumonia (goats), wah, pox and even para- sitic infestation. On the whole, goats appear to be worse offenders than sheep ; indeed the writer is of the opinion that goats will sometimes abort as the result of the slightest interference even one so trivial as an intravenous injection. According to some reports, the rate of abortion at such times may be extremely high and even 70 to 80 per cent has been suggested. Whenever blood testing has been possible in connection with these outbreaks, the results have been consistently negative to Brucellosis and Salmonella infections. As in buffaloes, so in goats there are certain abortion epidemics of obscure aetiology. Unhappily the majority of these have occurred long before they can be investigated and as a rule no recorded history is available. One government herd, however, has been investigated and reinvestigated for more than a decade and while, like those of the last sub-head, the results of their investigations are largely speculative ; as they not only typify some problems of goat abortion, but also parallel the enigmas of buffalo abortion they merit a short critical review.* The herd in question was founded in the summer 1928, mainly with in-kid goats purchased from around Gujranwala but about 20 local goats were already on the farm as early as April of that year. In the same autumn one local and four purchased goats aborted, and abortions have continued to the present day. Both then and since, undoubted Brucellosis has been prevalent in a large cow-herd grazing the same forest, and, although the occurrence of Brucellosis in some at least of the goats is irrefutable, many attempts have been made to prove that the actual abortions are due to some other cause. The reasons for this are threefold viz., (1) with the exception of one dubious record, many careful attempts to isolate Brucella from the goats have failed. (2) The serum agglutination test has given irregular and, at times, meagre proof of Brucella infection. (3) At times, aborting goats have shown symptoms of other diseases, notably metritis and mastitis, thus suggesting a different aetiology. To anyone familiar with the difficulties of isolating Brucella from goats in India, item (1) will appear insignificant, and if, indeed, for many valid reasons, it has been impossible to isolate Brucella, it has been equally impossible to secure a substitute pathogen, or even to offer the least vestige of a substitute pathology. A new pathology might, at first sight, be thought to appear in item (3) in as much as, out of 66 goats aborting between 1929 and 1935, 17 were stated to have died of metritis within a month or so of parturition : on the other hand no such deaths have been reported since 1935, and none occurred in a big abortion outbreak in 1943. Indeed, the records show that metritis is a wholly inconstant complication. As for the agglütination test, several fairly plain concepts can be constructed from the records. Firstly the periods during which infected goats remained blood-positive have been very short ; e.g. of 53 goats, 28 reacted on one occasion, 15 on two occasions, 10 on three and 0 on four occasions, when *Many of the records used here are due to the work (unpublished) of M. Abdussalam, L.V.P. who carefully investigated the problem in 1936 ; his kindness in permitting their use is gratefully acknowledged. K2
190 Contagious Abortion of Cattle, Sheep and Goats [VOL. XVIII, PART III, tested four or more times at very irregular intervals averaging about six months apart. Indeed, the inspection of individual records suggests that few goats were blood-positive for more than two months at a time. Secondly, the appearance of positive blood reactions in relation to abortions was very irregular (Table XLVII). TABLE XLVII Blood reactions in relation to abortions Before abortion Months. After abortion SEPTEMBER, 1948] JOHN B. POLDING 191 then from the earlier investigations is that Brucellosis is present in the herd, although its very irre- gular manifestations in the form of agglutination responses leave much doubt as to whether it was the sole cause of the abortions. The history after 1935 is very similar. As a result of the bad abortion years of 1934, 1935 and 1937 special pains were taken from 1937 onwards in the testing and disposal of reacting goats.* The abortions diminished until in 1939 there were none ; whereupon the testing regulations were relaxed. In February 1940, the whole herd was tested and found practically disease-free, but during the 10 succeeding months 11 (4.4 per cent) goats aborted, while in 1942 and 1943 the abortion rate had again become serious. In May 1943, the whole herd was tested, 10 per cent being positive ; while in July of the same year reactors had increased to 22 per cent. Of 15 animals aborting up to this time, rather less than 50 per cent were positive, as also were 6 per cent of the young stock. The 1943 outbreak was carefully investigated by one of the writer's staff. Unfortunately, as with all previous investigators, he arrived after the abortions had ceased. However, cultures (tryp- tose broth, MacConkey's and Robertson's media) and inoculations (guinea-pig) were made of the cream and vaginal secretions of the recently aborted animals. Vaginal mucus was also examined for protozoan infection. From none of these preparations could any pathogen of known significance, including Brucella, be isolated. The most commonly occurring commensals were gram-positive cocci while from two cultures non-pathogenic bipolar organisms were isolated. A Listerella-like organism which has been described on page 184 was secured from one other culture. The whole history of this endemic is unsatisfactory, mainly on account of the irregularities of the agglutination test and failures of isolation. It is quite clear, however, that a proportion of goats have been infected with Brucellosis and it may be supposed that many abortions have been due to this infection. The supposition is supported by the fluctuations in the abortion rate following the tightening and relaxation of the test-and-disposal orders. Plainly, Brucellosis should be perma- nently eradicated from the herd, a process not without difficulty, as new goats are constantly being purchased and existing goats must occasionally be exposed to infected cattle. If after permanent eradication abortions continue, then plainly, there is room for a further investigation which should begin, at least, by a following up of the investigation of the Listerella-like organism already described. It is to be noted that rainfall, intercurrent extra-genital disease, diet deficiencies, and food-poisoning cannot be implicated in this endemic.

SUMMARY This report is a detailed record of a five year's scheme of investigation into abortion amongst the cattle, sheep and goats of India. The text is divided into nine main sections, all, but the two last, being devoted to the subject of Brucellosis. * In 1930-31 on the orders of the Director of Veterinary Services of the Province reacting goats were disposed of, but before 1937 it is very difficult to trace how long this order was rigorously enacted.
192 Contagious Abortion of Cattle, Sheep and Goats [VOL. XVIII, PART III, Sections I, II and III. Epidemiology Section I outlines the distribution of Brucellosis in India, and at the sale time distinguishes, two forms of the disease viz., an imported and an indigenous. The former occurs in organized farms whilst the latter is shown to have a remarkable incidence in its being almost entirely confined to the villages of the humid Indian peninsula. The character of indigenous strains is peculiar. Bru- cellosis of any sort was found to be rare in the arid north-west and fairly common in the south. Details are given of both farm and village outbreaks. Section II is mainly composed of epidemiological data for the various classes of Indian stock (e.g., mean figures of frequency of abortion). Examples of exceptional occurrences are also given. It is concluded that the descending order of the susceptibility amongst the various stock is European cows ; crossbred European-zebu ; indigenous zebu ; buffaloes ; goats ; sheep. Section III reviews, in the light of the field findings, the probable means by which Brucellosis is spread in India, and it appears that elementary hygiene and climate are of supreme importance in this respect. The extremes of the Indian climate offer an unusual opportunity for the study of the effect of climate on the spread of the disease and a hypothesis that moisture is an almost essential factor in the dissemination of Brucellosis is deduced from the distribution of the infection in this country. This hypothesis not only fits the observed facts but is supported by an experimental de- monstration that Brucella die much more rapidly in dry, than in moist, air. Section IV. Bacteriology Section IV records the examination of some 50 Indian Brucella strains. From the aspect of virulence (white mice tests), antigenic structure and sensitiveness and tendency to dissociate these strains are unremarkable. In one respect only do they differ from these of Europe, i.e., some 40 per cent of all Indian field strains have typing characteristics intermediate between abortus and melitensis. All village strains were of this nature and evidence is adduced which suggests this is an indigenous strain. Section V. Diagnosis The standards for an all-India tube agglutination test are discussed and fixed in section V. This test is intended for fine diagnosis but the use of the quick test is urged for survey work. The reliability and specificity of these tests in Indian animals are reviewed and examples of the interpreta- tion of field results are given. A number of optimum proportion tests fixing the best density for tube antigen are reported and a simple method used for standardizing the density against reconstructed dried serum is explained. Section VI. Human infection Section VI discusses the human aspect of Brucellosis in India. Reports of the prevalence of melitensis infection in this country, published during the first decade of the century, are reconciled with contemporary reports, asserting the scarcity of the disease by supposing that spread of infection from the Mediterranean basin is obstructed by the interposing deserts, and that the infection referred to in the earlier records was introduced into strictly localized areas by trooping movements from Malta. Man's liability to infection by the indigenous strains of south India is discussed, but little real evidence can be adduced in this connection. Section VII. Control Section VII deals with control of Brucellosis (a) by hygiene and (b) by vaccination. In India, it is not usually feasible to control minor endemics by sufficiently frequent tests followed by disposal. It has been noticed, however, that where zebu live more or less on the ranch system, in dry sunny climate, Brucellosis is almost self-eliminating ; this tendency, augmented by a brief maternal segrega-

It appears that the method may be of value in the semi-desert areas of India, at least. The subsection on vaccination first records an examination of the behaviour of overseas vaccine strains under Indian conditions. The bad keeping qualities of the vaccine are noted, and by means of plate counts, the effects of extreme temperature variations in temperatures, and shaking on the mortality of Brucella suspensions is investigated. Temperatures of upwards of 80°F. were found to cause rapid death, variations of temperature had no obvious lethal effect, whilst shaking is undoubted- ly the cause of a certain mortality. By means of several counting experiments, a substrate was evolved for the vaccine that materially improved its keeping qualities in extreme conditions. Re- commendations follow regarding the preparation, issue and application of the vaccine in the field. The section concludes with a few notes on the early results of calfhood and adult vaccination in Indian farms. Section VIII. Other infectious abortion In this section, attention is briefly called to infectious abortion other than Brucellosis. The apparent absence of T. foetus from India is noted, as also the rareness of other abortifacient infections such as Listerellosis. A new bacterium is described that may in some measure be concerned with goat abortion. Section IX. Non-specific abortion Circumstances commonly leading to non-specific abortion are discussed in section IX. In the zebu, such occurrences are thought to be rare and almost exclusively associated with systemic dis- turbances such as fevers. To a much greater degree this also applies to the buffalo, in which animal obscure epidemics of abortion are frequently noted, often associable with extreme rainfall. This phenomenon is discussed at some length. Both sheep and goats are very liable to abort as the result of systemic shocks and it is not im- probable that the organism mentioned in section VIII, or some other undescribed microbe is the cause of certain obscure epizootic abortions amongst goats in the Punjab.

Livestock Farm, Hissar (Received for publication on 9 July 1948) QUALITY in wool is a vague term. It is intended to indicate a combination of certain characters like medullation, length, fineness, strength and elasticity etc., which help to improve the spinning quality of the fibres ultimately affecting the merits of the finished cloth. Most of our Indian breeds of sheep produce only the carpet class of wool i.e., a mixture of varying proportions of wool and hair. The presence of hair (technically known as medullated fibres) is a major defect in wool as it prevents its use for the manufacture of good clothing material in comparison to Merino and Cross bred wools which are either totally free from medullation or show only a slight amount of hairiness. The presence of hair in wool reduces its spinning quality, gives roughness to the cloth, is weaker in tensile strength and does not take up the dyes. Any attempt to improve the quality of Indian wool must primarily include the elimination or reduction of hair in the fleece. Medullation in wool has been found to be highly correlated to fineness, strength and handle of wool, thereby indicating that improvement in medullation alone will greatly affect the quality of Indian wools. With the partition of the country, the problem of making the Indian Union self-sufficient as regards its requirements of various types of wool has assumed greater importance. To achieve the object in view, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, has recently drawn up a plan for the production of various types of wool, both by grading up with the Merino and by selective breeding of some of the indigenous breeds. The plan for selective breeding is based on the work done at Hissar. While going through a large number of fleece samples of Bikaneri and Lohi sheep in the wool analysis laboratory at the Hissar Farm, it was noticed that there was wide variation, ranging from a purely woolly fleece to a totally hairy type. It was, therefore, felt that the evolution of a clothing type of sheep should not be impossible. Accordingly, the improvement of fleece quality by selective breeding was started in both the breeds in the year 1943-44. In the course of about five years, it has been noticed that with the help of an improved system of judging the fleece quality and resorting to judicious selection, an appreciable improvement in the fleece quality of the flocks can be affected. TESTING OF FLEECES AND FIXING OF QUALITY STANDARDS As a pre-requisite to improving the quality of wool, an accurate method for the testing of indivi- dual fleeces and laying down some quality standards was considered essential. It had already been experienced that assessment of fleece quality by feel was an unreliable method and often led to in- correct results. Some standard laboratory method was, therefore, necessary to fulfil this requirement. This was accomplished by adopting the ' rapid benzol test ' described by Nanda, Singh and Mongre- [1946]. Small representative samples were taken from the shoulder region of each sheep and tested in the wool laboratory for the percentage of medullation in the fleece. This method afforded satisfac- tory results for the purpose in view. Quality standards of foreign wools are well known in the trade, but India produces mostly coarse type of wool for which there are no suitable standards. Any type of coarse or fine wool, irrespective of its utility value in the manufacturing process, is classed as a carpet wool. Certain arbitrary standards were laid down for use in the present work. To fix up these working standards, a large number of Bikaneri and Lohi sheep were first surveyed for the quality of wool on medullation basis, and it was 195
196 Improvement of Wool Quality by Selective Breeding [Vol. XVIII, Part IV noticed that in these breeds, the range of medullation varied from 0 to 100 per cent. On the basis of medullation of wool, fleeces were divided into the following four classes [Nanda, 19471. A Class . . Fine woolly fleeces with 0 to 20 per cent medullation, quite suitable for the manufacture of clothing material. B Class . . Ideal carpet type fleeces with 20 to 40 per cent medullation, best suited for carpets. C Class . . Coarse hairy fleece with 40 to 70 per cent medullation, conforming to in- ferior type of carpet wool suited for low grade carpets. D Class . . Very coarse hairy fleeces with 70 per cent and higher medullation, hardly suitable for spinning and weaving processes. Selective breeding and inter-breeding of different classes The procedure adopted for selective breeding consisted in classifying flocks of Bikaneri and Lohi ewes into A, B, C and D types according to the standard mentioned above. To start with, only a small percentage of better type fleeces were available, as the majority of ewes came in C and D classes. More of A and B type rams were introduced each year and the C and D type ewes were eliminated in successive years. Shoulder samples of all the male progeny at the lamb's clip and of the female progeny at the 2nd clip were tested to judge the improvement and to help in selection for future breed- ing. This practice, exhibited a gradual but distinct improvement in the new progeny with increased number of A and B type lambs each year. The following figures indicate the results obtained in Table I. Table I Bi kaneri sheepDecember 1948] P. N. NANDA AND GURBAX SINGH 197 It is evident from the above Table I that in about 4 to 5 years' time, the percentage of progeny with finer type of wool increased from 6.0 to 30.4 per cent in the Bikaneri flock and from 9.8 to 40.6 per cent in Lohi flock with a decrease in the coarse and hairy types from 41.1 to 10.8 per cent and 37.4 per cent to 0 per cent in the two flocks respectively. With continued selection, complete elimination of C and D types and the establishment of pure A or B type flock is now envisaged. Improvement would have been quicker if it had been possible to use all A class rams from the very first year. This was not possible as only a limited number of male lambs upto the required standard were available for selection in the beginning. The comparatively quicker improvement in the Lohi flock was due to the larger number of A and B type rams used. With a view to study the results of inter-breeding among different classes, the inheritance of medullation in the grading up of C and D type ewes with A and B type rams and the possibility of evolving a clothing type woolly sheep by inter-crossing of A class sheep, breeding records of different crosses during the last three to four years have been analyzed. The information, thus obtained, provides a basis for formulating a general plan for the improvement of fleece quality of Indian sheep. The results obtained by various crosses are shown in Table II.

Though the differences in the performance of different classes of ewes in both the flocks are not very significant, the under noted inferences are however apparent : (i) ' A ' type is definitely a lighter and a smaller sheep. (ii) Fertility in the A class sheep is lower as compared with other classes. (iii) Although the birth weights of the lambs from different classes are uniform, yet the weaning weights of lambs from A class ewes are the lowest. This indirectly indicates a poor flow of milk in these ewes. (iv) Inspite of the fact that A class is a lighter sheep, there are no significant differences in the average wool yields during the year. (v) Except for a slightly heavier body weight, D class ewes possess little advantage over other classes. It is therefore useless to retain these hairy type of ewes in the flock. Besides the above inferences, a slightly higher mortality in the A class lambs is also apparent. As the year under study was an abnormal one, with heavy rains and severe adverse conditions, this factor will have to be studied during normal years. With the improvement in fleece quality, another feature observed was a remarkable decrease in the percentage of twin births in Lohi sheep. This breed is well- known for its milk capacity and a high percentage of twins. The percentage of twins from different classes of ewes from the year 1943 to 1946 were as below : Class of ewes Percentage of twin births A . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12.5 B . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15.9 C . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18.1 D . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20.0 PROGENY TEST OF RAMS Progeny test is a reliable method to ascertain the transmitting qualities of a sire and is one of the surest means to bring about a substantial improvement in any class of livestock. While, carrying out selective breeding for fleece quality, it was noticed that although A class rams always produced
200 Improvement of Wool Quality by Selective Breeding [Vol. XVIII, Part IV higher percentage of better class progeny when used on different classes of ewes, their transmitting ability was highly variable when compared with one another. This fact is revealed from Table IV below : Table IV Progeny test of rams No. of ram Class Class of ewes lired Number of lambs dropped Percentage of lambs in different classes Remarks A B C D 314 A A 9 33.0 66.7 .. ..

The cause for this variable prepotency in the rams can either be attributed to variable inheritance or variation in the medullation percentage of the fleece which ranges from 0 to 20 per cent in the shoulder samples. On analysing the whole fleece, significant variation of quality has been observed in different regions of the sheep's body. This fact further widens the medullation range in different individuals when it is taken collectively for the whole fleece. In order to obtain the maximum advan- tage in the selective breeding, the following points should be borne in mind : (i) All rams should invariably be subjected to the progeny test at the close of the breeding season and only those rams should be retained for breeding which show a high percentage of A class progeny. (ii) Only those rams should be used for breeding which show the least percentage of medulla- tion. (iii) While assessing the quality of a ram, medullation percentage should not be relied upon on shoulder sample alone but the collective result of the whole fleece should be evaluated by testing representative samples from different regions of the body. Discussion It is evident from the above that improvement of wool quality in the Bikaneri and Lohi sheep is possible under careful selective breeding. Large scale improvement in the village flocks can he undertaken, on the same lines, by establishing of breeding farms and issuing of tested rams in different localities. Before any large-scale plans are taken up throughout the country certain important aspects deserve special attention. Firstly, a general survey of the sheep breeds throughout the country is essential to ascertain their potentialities for the improvement of wool quality in relation to climate and other environ- mental factors. India as a whole, presents a wide range in its sheep breeds reared under a variety of conditions. From the South to the North, there is a gradual improvement in the quality of sheep
December 1948] P. N. Nanda and Gurbax Singh 201 till the best breeds are found in the northern parts of the country. The range of climate over this area is also variable to the same extent. This shows that limitations of climate etc., are probably responsible for the inherent qualities of different breeds. Drastic changes under such circumstances may not produce appreciable results. Two alternatives are, therefore, suggested, before any definite lines are laid down for improvement. In those breeds which are extremely hairy in the fleece and possess little potentialities for a woolly type, attempts to improve their character to a clothing type must be tried with caution. A suitable plan would be to bring these up to an ideal carpet wool produc- ing sheep, corresponding with B type animals described in this note. For dealing with other breeds, which are located in favourable environments, efforts may be made to breed them for a clothing type sheep. Secondly, much of the impetus to produce a better class wool depends upon the price obtained in the market. Unfortunately, market conditions are very unsatisfactory in the country and there is no encouragement for the breeders of better quality wool. All wools whether good or poor, classed or unclassed and washed or unwashed sell practically at the same price in villages. To encourage breeders to produce better wool, it is essential that the markets should be organized on systematic lines and the prices controlled on some recognized standard basis. Thirdly, it has been observed that the fine quality wool has a limited use as a cottage industry. This is because no head-way has been made in providing suitable hand looms for treating this fibre. With the increase in production of good quality wool, it is necessary that particular attention should be paid to this item. In order to encourage the production of a better quality wool, adequate safe- guards will also be needed to restrict imports of foreign wool. Summary 1. A method for improving wool quality in the Bikaneri and Lohi sheep by selective breeding has been suggested. 2. Workable standards of wool quality according to their utility value in the manufacturing processes have been laid down on medullation basis. 3. Breeding from A type rams, higher percentage of better class progeny is obtained. The percentage of medullation in the fleeces of the progeny appears to be directly related to the percentage of medullation in the ewes and rams. 4. Inter-breeding of A type sheep (having less than 20 per cent medullation) produces a high percentage of better class progeny, indicating definite possibilities for evolving a clothing type sheep from both these breeds. 5. Improvement in fleece quality appears to result in a decrease in the size, live weight, fertility of ewes and growth of lambs. It is also apparent that these deficiencies can be made good by fixing minimum standards for rams and paying special attention to the milk flow of the dams at the time of selection. 6. It has been observed that the A class rams possess variable prepotency in transmitting their characters to the progeny. This may be due to a variable percentage of medullation in their fleece which range from 0 to 20 per cent. To ensure maximum improvement in the flock, all rams should be subjected to the progeny test at the close of the breeding season and only desirable rams should be retained for breeding. In addition, assessing of wool quality of the ram should be based on testing representative samples from the different regions of the fleece and not from the shoulder alone. 7. For large-scale improvement in the village flocks, it seems, that a preliminary survey of all the sheep breeds throughout the country is necessary to lay down a definite plan. Proper control and organization of wool markets with the establishment of utilization centres to deal with the fine quality wool in hand looms are additional requirements to encourage breeders to produce fine quality of wool.

In the first set, process- ing of raw milk consisted in bringing it just to boil. In the second set, boiling Was continued for 10 minutes. In the hay-box method two sets of duplicate lots of 7½ lb. morning's raw milk filled in well seasoned mud pots of 8 lb. capacity were given initial treatmnets as mentioned above. Immediately after the treatment the pots were transferred into uniformly packed hay-boxes and left undisturbed till evening. In the evening, warm milk in the pot kept in hay-box was transferred into a second pob of 50 lb. capacity containing 7½ lb. raw evening milk. Morning's warm preserved milk and evening's cold raw milk together with 2 per cent (Bangalore) or 1½ per cent (Jhallar) of lactic starter from stock supply were thoroughly mixed and allowed to ripen. In the simmering method, the two sets of duplicate lots of 7½ lb. morning's raw milk filled in seasoned mud pots of 50 lb. capacity were given the prescribed heat treatment. The pots with their contents were then transferred to separate choolas with smouldering fire of cowdung cakes. The milk in the pot was thus kept simmering until evening when 7½ lb. of evening's raw milk was added. The mixed milk was then treated in the same way as in the hay-box method. The treated milk samples by different methods were allowed to ripen for a period of 15-16 hours under atmospheric conditions. The curd at the end of the ripening period was thoroughly mixed and samples were taken for determining the acidity before churning. Churning was done in the same vessel with the aid of indigenous churning device. No special precaution was taken in controlling the temperature of churning except that cold water was added from time to time. The total quantity of cold water added was equivalent to that of the curd. The churning was discontinued when the butter granules were formed. After allowing 15 minutes for settling, the butter granules were collect- ed and worked up to a lump as practised in the villages. As soon as a sample of butter was prepared, it was tested for acidity, curd content and moisture. The quality of butter-milk was also examined for its taste and flavour. Soon after butter from each treatment was prepared, it was clarified into ghee in aluminium degchies held over kerosene stove. During clarification the melt was continuously stirred and the flame of the stove was so adjusted as to finish the removal of moisture between 110-120°C. After allowing to cool, the ghee samples were strained through fine muslin cloth and their weight recorded. The fresh ghee samples under each treatment made in different seasons were judged for their market quality according to the following basis : Points for judging Score allotted I.

The methods followed in the determination of these constants were the same as given in the Miscellaneous Bulletin No. 64 of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. The keeping quality of the samples was followed by determining the peroxide value at regular intervals of representative preparations which were filled in 1 lb. tins of uniform size and stored at a constant temperature of 104°F. The market quality and the physico-chemical constants of the stored samples were also judged at the end of the storage period of three months.
December 1948] M. P. Srivastava, et al 205 In view of the fact that milk used at Bangalore was mixed from cow and buffalo, and at Jahallar from buffalo only, ghee was also prepared from the same aliquots of milk by the standard cream- butter method to facilitate comparison of yield, market quality and storage property of ghee obtained by the methods under investigation. Results and discussion The effect of the method of heat treatment and subsequent preservation on the quality milk, curd, lassi and butter : The role of the hay-box is essentially to offer insulation to heat processed milk so that at an elevated temperature it can remain sweet till the evening's collection is ready to be added. The efficiency of the method is to be judged, therefore, from (i) the degree of heat conservation it affords against continuous heat transmission entailed in the simmering of milk and (ii) the extent of prolifera- tion of the surviving micro-organisms. The temperature of hay-box preserved and simmered milk just before evening quota is added has been found to be 120-130°F and 145-155°F respectively. The lower and upper limits of the range are obviously influenced by the seasonal atmospheric temperature. In Table I are given the average figures of acidity, total count and presumptive coliform in the morning milk at different stages of its handling.

In the course of the present investigation, neither at Bangalore nor at Jhallar there was any instance of the actual curdling of the morning milk. Perhaps this might have been due to the shorter interval (6.7 hours) of preservation. Experimental data obtained recently in the Dairy Technology Section of the Indian Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore, show that if milk is collected in hot and humid season and stored at an elevated temperature varying from 120-140°F., curdling of milk takes place within 8 hours. As in actual practice, the preservation period in the villages may have to be as long as 12 hours, the hay-box method seems to be of doubtful utility. Srinivasan and Banerjee [1946] and Rangappa et al [1946], have recently shown that more than the quantitative, the qualitative distribution of microflora in milk, prior to its ripening, decides the nature of fermentation and thereby the quality of the curd on which, in turn, will depend the quality of butter and butter-milk. In the present methods where the evening's raw milk is added to morn- ing's processed milk, the significance of initial processing on the quality of the curd or butter or butter- milk is practically lost because it has been observed that the addition of evening's raw milk invariably introduces coliform contamination which is absent in morning's processed and preserved milk. The re-entrance of coliform contamination is indicative of the presence of harmful organism which would eventually frustrate the use of lactic starter in setting up the desired curd. This is borne out by the fact that the curd in all the methods has been slightly blown up, and possessed of ropy texture, with the rising up of the curd separately from the whey. Due to this uncertain course of fermentation, irrespective of the method, butter-milk (lassi) obtained at Bangalore was uniformly of inferior quality. According to the opinion of Jhallar workers butter-milk from simmering process was slightly more palatable than that produced by the hay-box method.

As the direct comparison of the data may prove confusing, it is considered convenient to express the relative yields by hay-box and simmering methods as the coefficient of the yield from the standard cream-butter method used both at Bangalore and Jhallar. In Table III, the data have been set out accordingly.

The increased yield is about 2.4 to 2.9 per cent at Bangalore and between 1.7 to 3.0 per cent at Jhallar. The slightly lower yield by the simmering process may be an effect arising out of high temperature processing of milk for prolonged period bringing in its train extensive denaturation of milk protein. The latter in turn gets incorporated with the butter and at the time of clarification forms a relatively larger ghee residue absorbing more of the milk fat which would otherwise pass out in the ghee layer at the time of filtration. A careful scrutiny of the data on outturn of ghee prepared in different months of the year showed that for all the methods tried, no significant difference was observed at Bangalore which could be ascribed to seasonal effect. Whereas at Jhallar, winter yield of ghee by hay-box and simmering process was about 4.6 and 5.0 per cent higher than the yield in the rainy season. The absence of seasonal influence at Bangalore may be due to equable atmospheric temperature throughout the course of the investigation.

208 Bay-Box and Simmering Processes of Preserving Milk [Vol. XVIII, Part IV It is evident from the score that, when fresh, market quality of ghee prepared by hay-box method is definitely superior to that of simmering method. The variation in the physico-chemical constants suggests that but for slightly higher acid value for ' hay-box ' ghee, the method of preparation has no appreciable effect on the constants of ghee. There is, however, some difference in this respect between the creamery-butter and indigenous methods. In the cream-butter-ghee, according to the present finding, there is a slight decrease in the S. V. and P. V. indicative of the presence in ghee of lower proportion of the higher fatty acids and water insoluble steam volatile lower fatty acids. The development of unsaturation as evident from the I. V. and also acidity seem to be somewhat lower in the cream-butter samples. Doctor, Banerjee and Kpthavalla [1940] in their study on the effect of the method of manufacture on the physico-chemical constants of ghee have, however, shown that the methods of preparation, such as, creamery butter and common indigenous method have no marked effect on the chemical properties of freshly made ghee. Owing to the constancy in the dairy ration at Bangalore, no significant change was noticed in the initial quality of ghee prepared in different seasons. At Jhallar only R. M. value could be deter- mined and it was noted that there was no marked difference in R. M. value of ghee prepared by differ- ent treatments. There was, however, a significant difference in this value between ghee samples prepared in the winter and rainy seasons. The lower value in the winter was due probably to feeding the buffaloes with cotton seed and dry fodder. Keeping quality of stored ghee.December 1948] M. P. Srivastava, et al 209 Table V210 Hay-Box and Simmering Processes of Preserving Milk [Vol. XVIII, Part IV A perusal of the data in Table V suggests that prolonged storage does not materially affect the S. V., K. M., P. V. and I. V. of ghee samples prepared by different methods. The two constants which exhibit definite change are peroxide value and acidity. Both these values have significantly increased during the course of storage. The greatest increase in peroixde value is with hay-box (just boiled) sample followed by hay-box (10 min. boiled) simmering (10 min. boiled) and simmering (just boiled). The acid value is observed to follow the same order. The increase in these values is relatively greater in the samples prepared in the monsoon than in those prepared in the post-monsoon and winter month. These findings are supported by the trend of change in the peroxide value depicted in fig. 1, which also clearly indicates the comparative rate of deterioration in the storage quality of ghee samples prepared by different methods. Summary Investigation carried out to study the relative efficiency of ' hay-box ' and ' simmering' methods in the preservation of morning milk shows that while the former method is more economical and obviates acquiring of smoky flavour in the final product, its efficacy as a means to preserve milk in all seasons is doubtful. In both methods, the present practice of adding evening's unprocessed milk takes away much of the benefit derivable from processing and sweet preservation of the morning milk. Such addition does not ensure the type of fermentation desired in the course of ripening of milk with lactic starter and thu6 may eventually result in the production of poor quality butter and butter-milk. The results of the present trials substantiate the claim made regarding higher outturn and initial quality of ghee by the hay-box method as against village simmering process. The keeping quality of ' hay-box ' ghee, however, is inferior to that of ghee prepared by the simmering method.

INVESTIGATIONS ON FAMINE RATIONS KANS (SACCHARUM SPONTANEUM LINN.) A REORIENTATION IN ITS USE AS CATTLE FEED By Narain Das Kehar, Animal Nutrition Section, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 11 May 1948) (With one text figure) SINCE the publication of the first article on famine rations [Kehar, 1944], more information has become available on the quantitative and qualitative shortages of livestock feed. Ware [1943] pointed out that the total supply of roughage and concentrates in India (excluding States, for which accurate data were not available) was sufficient only for 78.83 and 29.1 per cent respec- tively of the adult bovine population. If this supply is calculated [Kehar, 1946] on the basis of physiological requirements of Indian cattle, weighing about 600 lb., the entire roughage and con- centrates from all organized sources will suffice for only 106 and 35 million adult cattle respectively. This, however, does not take into account their milk production or growth requirements, nor the reqirements of 48 million sheep, 38 million goats, 4.5 million equines, 1 million camels, and 173 million fowls. These shortages are not only of quantitative nature but also qualitative, because straws, which are nutritionally poorer than cultivated fodders, constitute more than 50 per cent of the total rough- age supply. Even with normal rainfall the feeding-stuffs fall short of the livestock requirements Since rainfall is rather uncertain in the tropics and in India three-fourth of the cultivated crop depends on it, acute scarcity of fodder results from drought caused by partial or total failure of monsoon or from floods caused by excessive rains. Both these conditions affect the productiveness of the soil and livestock are exposed to the ravages of famine. Hardly a decade passes without the visitation of a famine varying only in its intensity and it is known that since 1708 B. C. 105 famines have devas- tated India. During such droughts, tanks dry up and springs fail to reach the surface. In the 1937-40 famine212 Investigations of Famine Rations [Vol. XVIII, Part IV India, except for insignificant amounts used for thatching purposes and apart from the indifferent [Hall, 1946] and occasional browsing by animals, it is considered as one of the most pernicious weeds and large amounts of money are spent in certain farms on its eradication. Howard and Howard [1929] pointed out that in extreme cases of infestation the farmer had to give up cultivation of the particular land and Howard (1927) showed that kans was responsible for an enormous monetary loss in reducing the yield of cotton. A survey of the kans-ridden areas suggested that it might be utilized as a famine fodder in green or dry condition. In both forms its chemical make-up (Tables I and VII) indicated that in green condition it compared favourably with some of the cultivated fodders and at the ripe stage with cereal straws. Encouraged by the above observations, it was considered desirable to study (1) its palatability in both dry and green conditions when fed as a single or mixed feed, (2) its nutritive value, (3) its effect upon the health of animals when fed over a prolonged period, and (4) yield of dry matter and other nutrients per acre. Experimental Since according to available information kans was not considered a normal fodder and was to be tried as a stand-by for scarcity periods, Kumauni bullocks, which were used as experimental animals, were kept for about 10 days on half the scheduled ration before commencing feeding of kans. The object was to simulate fodder shortage conditions prevailing in scarcity areas. The feeding trials were conducted at two different stages of growth of the plant, namely before blossoming in the green state and after it was dead ripe. (1) Experiments on green kans Green kans was analyzed for crude protein, ether extract, crude fibre, nitrogen-free extract, carbohydrates, calcium, and phosphorus. It was found (Table I) that it compared favourably with some of the cultivated fodders like guinea grass (prime) and napier grass (prime).

214 Investigations of Famine Rations [Vol. XVIII, Part IV The data in Table III show that the protein digestibility from kans is quite satisfactory. It is interesting to note that though animal No. 240 consumed a larger quantity of the roughage, the excretion. in the fæces of undigested protein was more than that of the other two animals, the average digestibility coefficient of 57 per cent of protein is not much different from those of the individual data recorded. The digestibility of ether extract is about 20 per cent less in animal No. 39 while the other two showed concordant results. The digestibility of crude fibre is of great significance in ruminants and it may be observed that the average digestibility coefficient of crude fibre of green kans is as high as 76 per cent. All the animals behaved uniformly so far as the digestion of this constituent is concerned. An average digestibility coefficient of 76 per cent is generally found in good quality green feeds, like oats or maize. A variation of about 15 per cent is observed in the digestion coefficient of N-free extract and since there is little variation in the crude fibre digestibility between the individual animals, the total carbohydrate digestibility shows a variation of about 12 per cent only. Nitrogen balance under green kans feeding The nitrogen balance data shown in Table IV indicate that the animals had enough protein and that there was a considerable margin of safety when green kans formed the sole feed.

In comparing the digestibility coefficient of kans (Table V) with some of the green feeds it was observed that the amount of digestible protein of 3.13 lb. per 100 lb. of kans is slightly lower than that obtained from an equal amount of bajra, elephant grass, guinea grass or maize, but the amount of digestible carbohydrate is more than that of bajra, elephant grass and guinea grass, and a starch equivalent value of 19.3 is considerably higher than those of all the above-mentioned green feeds.

December 1948] N. D. Kehar 217 The results show that in respect of crude protein, N-free extract, and total carbohydrate, two of the animals showed very satisfactory results while animal No. 39 recorded an increased diges- tibility coefficient in all these fractions. The crude fibre digestibility was, however, uniform, and this was so with ether extract also. If the digestibility coefficients of kans at both the green and ripe stages are compared, it will be seen from Tables VIII and IX that when ripe kans is fed together with a suitable amount of cake, the values for ripe and green kans are almost identical with regard to digestible fractions of crude protein, ether extract and crude fibre, whereas the digesti- bilities of N-free extract and total carbohydrate are invariably higher when green kans is fed as a single feed. It may also be seen from the figures given below that the starch equivalent values of both green and ripe kans are practically the same, whereas the amount of digestible protein is considerably greater in the green stage. The excess of digestible protein available in 100 lb. of green kans as compared with the ripe stage is equivalent to 3.3 lb. of rape cake. 100 lb. of ripe kans 100 lb. of green kans (Dry Matter, 85 per cent) (Dry Matter, 46 per cent) D.P.

Kehar 219 Meanwhile two more kumauni bullocks were placed on the same ration on the 55th day of experi- mentation. They started relishing this ration from the beginning and by the 120th day their weight had increased from 244 lb. to 272 lb. Unfortunately at this stage one animal developed fever and had to be discontinued and was replaced after 10 days by another. The mean weights of the two animals on the 130th day of the experiment was 251 lb., which rose to 278 lb. on 210th day when feeding was discontinued. From the above long term feeding trial extending over a period of about nine months it is evident that ripe kans can be fed as a roughage without adverse effect. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Fig. 1. Average weight of two Kumaoni bullock under 'Kang' feeding. Amount of kans available in India. It has not been possible to obtain precise information on this point, nor of the percentage that is satisfactorily utilized. The Chief Conservators of Forests and Directors of Agriculture of different provinces were asked to supply information as to the exact acreage under kans, along with its approximate yield but the replies were disappointing. Whereas all the officers reported that leans grows over large areas the amount of kans per acre was reported to vary from two md. in Assam to 100 md. in the Punjab. Nowhere has systematic work been done on the exact yield of kans per acre under a given set of conditions. In order to arrive at an approxi mate estimate, a plot measuring 65 feet square was selected at the Clutterbuckganj nursery through the courtesy of Mr. Kanjilal, Silviculturist, U. P., and the Chief Conservator of Forests, the United Provinces since the intention was to record the maximum yield the plant was cut when it reached the pre-flowering stage or a height of about 3 ft. Four cuts could be obtained in a year. The date of cutting and the yield per cut along with the chemical composition are given in Table XIII. D

(4861 lb. dry matter) containing 2039 lb. starch equi- valent and 3189 lb. of total digestible nutrients. Samples from all these four cuts were analyzed and it was found that if 4 per cent. crude protein, 0.4 per cent CaO and 0.5 per cent P2O5 are taken as the criteria of a good quality fodder, green kans warrants a place in that category. The foregoing observations indicating green kans at the pre-flowering stage to be equivalent to some of the cultivated fodders and ripe kans equal to some of the common cereal straws, will in- troduce a reorientation in our views about the use of kans. Although these experiments were origi- nally intended to make available some feeds to cattle under famine conditions, on the basis of the results reported above it can be safely recommended as a normal cattle feed. Summary In an effort to exploit hitherto unutilized sources of feeding stuffs, attempts have been made to find it Saceharum spontaneum (kans), which is not economically used much at present and is consi- dered a pest, can be used as cattle feed during famine periods. On chemical analysis kans was found to be fairly rich in protein and other constituents. Feeding trials on the pre-flowering and dead ripe stages of kans indicated that : 1. Green kans at the pre-flowering stage forms a maintenance ration and can be fed as a single feed. In regard to chemical composition and nutritive value it compares favourably with some of the cultivated fodders like guinea grass and napier grass. 2. Ripe kans compares favourably with common cereal straws like wheat and rice straw. The digestibility coefficient of protein of kans is far superior to that of wheat or rice straws. 3. Ripe kans roughage fed for about eight months showed no adverse effect on the health of animals. It has not been possible to ascertain the total quantity of kans available in India but from in- formation obtained from the various provincial Chief Conservators of forest and Directors of Agri- culture, it is assumed that it grows in every province over millions of acres. Each acre roughly produces about 10568 lb. of green kans, giving 2039 lb. of starch equivalent and 3189 lb. of total digestible nutrients.
December 1948] N. D. Kehar 221 Although these observations were originally intended to find some feed for starving animals to enable them to tide over drought periods, these findings indicate that kans can be recommended as a normal cattle feed.

Chaudhry, Animal Nutrition Section, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 25 February 1947) ACCORDING to a recent estimate the quantity of roughages available in India falls short of the requirement of the livestock population by about 45 per cent. This shortage is felt all the more when there is a partial or total failure of monsoon. Wars and famines have multiplied needs and created further shortages. To meet this quantitative insufficiency, efforts have been made to utilize so far unexploited fodder resources for animals. Observations on 'munj' Saccharum munj and molasses [Kehar 1944] and on Kans (Saccharum spontaneum)224 Investigations on Famine Rations [Vol. XVIII, Part IV The plants, after rounding of their spines, were placed before the animals. They showed no disinclination but did not consume their full quota of dry matter. It was, therefore, supplemented with molasses and it was observed that the dry matter consumption rose to about 1.75 lb. per 100 lb. body weight. Two adult Kumauni bullocks were then fed for a period of 15 weeks on a ration consisting of 2¼ lb. barley straw, 2¼ lb. Kantiara ½ lb. cake and ½ oz. salt. The quantity of barley* straw and Kantiara was soon raised to 3 lb. each. The animals presented a healthy appearance and the average body weight of the animals rose from 233 lb. to 245 lb. during the observation period. Two more adult animals were then fed on a ration* consisting of Kandiara and oat hay in equal proportion. After the first three weeks of the observation period both the animals suffered from a severe infection of ' foot and month ' and lost 22 lb. in weight. On recovery, they started picking up and gained an average weight of 10 lb. during the observation period of ten weeks. Kantiara when young, say up to six inches in height, has no spines and can therefore be fed to animals, as such. Young Kantiara (below six inches) mixed with wheat bhusa was next fed to a set of three adult bullocks for a period of five weeks. Towards the end of the period a metabolism trial was conducted by the procedure detailed in a previous article [Kehar 1944]. Two of the animals fell victim to ' foot and mouth ' disease and the trial could, therefore, be conducted on one animal only. The nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus balance was found to be positive and the animal gained 44 pounds in weight. Another feeding trial was next conducted on three adult bullocks. A mixture of dry Kantiara and wheat bhusa in the proportion of 1 : 2 was fed to them. The proportion of Kantiara was gradually raised and wheat bhusa withdrawn until the ration contained 60 per cent of Kantiara. The ration finally given to each animal consisted of ½ lb. rape cake, 4 lb. Kantiara and 2 lb. wheat bhusa. In addition to the above, each animal was given one oz. of common salt daily. The ration was fed for a period of eight weeks. Average dry matter consumption was 1.8 lb. per 100 lb. body weight. It will be observed from Table II that two of the animals gained in weight while the third showed a slight decrease. The net result was an average increase of 7.3 lb. in body weight on the experimental ration.

226 Investigations on Famine Rations [Vol. XVIII, Part IV It will be observed from the Tables given above that the replacement of wheat bhusa by Kantiara to the extent of 66 per cent gives a wide positive nitrogen and calcium balance. The phosphorus balance too is fairly positive. The digestible nutrients per 100 lb. of dry Kantiara as compared with other straws is given in Table VII. TABLE VII Digestible nutrients of Kantiara as compared with other straws STEPHANOFILARIASIS AMONG BUFFALOES IN ASSAM* BY V. R. GOPALAKRISHNAN, Veterinary Investigation Officer, Assam, Gauhati (Received for publication on 21 April 1948) THIS article is based on an investigation into an outbreak of Stephanofilariasis among buffaloes in Nowgong district, Assam, and it also records the observations on its occurrence in other parts of the province. Fairly large number of buffaloes are maintained in certain localities in Assam and the climatic and geograhpical conditions seem to suit them well. Stephanofilariasis or ear-sore as it is popularly called, was investigated in buffalo herds of several localities in five districts. The incidence of the disease has also been reported from other parts of India, particularly from Bihar, Orissa and Madras. The clinical lesion observed in the ear of buffaloes is known by various names, such as, ear-sore, Enzootic Otorrhoea, Otitis, Otacariasis, Contagious otorrhoea, etc. It seems probable that the condition is likely to be caused by other factors or agents than Stepkanofilaria Sp., depending upon the locality, climate and enviornment. However, in this paper, the specific nature of the parasite occurring in the ear-sore of buffaloes in Assam, is recorded and so it is considered appropriate to designate the condition as Stephanofilariasis. Microfilariae or the larval forms of certain adult nematode worms, are found free in circulating blood as well as in skin lesions of demestic animals in India. It is not uncommon to demonstrate the presence of microfilaria in the peripheral circulation, causing no apparent inconvenience to the animal. However, the occurrence of microfilaria as a morbid entity of importance affecting the health of some species of domestic animals in this country, has been recorded by some workers during the past few years. In a resume on the subject Sen [1931] stated that only two species of microfilaria were definitely recorded in equines and pointed out that the occurrence of microfilariasis in the horse as a condition concomitant with other forms of blood infection had been the general observation of workers. In dogs microfilariasis is commonly noticed with variable symptoms228 Stephanofilariasis among Buffaloes in Assam [Vol. XVIII, Part IV NATURE OF OCCURRENCE The disease occurs generally in a sporadic form. A few buffaloes in a herd are affected and there is hardly any indication either for a slow or for a rapid spread to other animals. Stray cases in a village are also observed. However, it occasionally assumes the form of an outbreak affecting a large number of buffaloes in a village and even spreading to a few villages in an area having large buffalo population. In such cases, the prevalence of the disease is seasonal ; the outbreaks being noticed in the rainy season, especially soon after the first showers in February and March. But stray cases, not of acute or severe type, have been observed in almost all the months of the year. It seems that the lesions are quiescent in winter season and become active during rains and in this respect the behaviour is similar to that of hump-sore of cattle. The occurrence of the disease is observed in all the districts in the plains of Assam, particularly in lowlying localities on either bank of the Brahmaputra and the Surma rivers and their major tributaries. In fact, the first investigation of affected cases was carried out in silchar on the bank of the Barak river, a tributary to the Surma, in Cachar district in November, 1939. Subsequently the disease was investigated in several localities of other districts, all of them situated on the bank of rivers. Cases are often seen in herds that are usually maintained in marshy low-lying areas or in riverain tracts that abound in grazing pastures. The occurrence of the disease is more common in the Surma Valley and the Lower Assam Valley than in the Upper Assam Valley. It is noteworthy that the disease has not been observed in buffaloes in the hill districts of the province. Buffaloes of both sexes and of all ages seen equally susceptible. But more cases are often seen among the adult and old animals. The disease is very rarely fatal even though the incidence of affected animals in an outbreak may vary from 20 to 50 per cent depending upon the severity of the outbreak. Outbreak in Nowgong district Investigation into this condition was carried out in March 1942 and in subsequent years in Kampur, Nowgong district. In the first instance, it prevailed in the form of an epidemic affecting about 30 buffaloes in Kampur and two adjoining villages. The outbreak was noticed about ten days after the rains. The first case was observed at Kampur in the middle of March and subse quently more cases were reported in the three villages. The villages are situated on either bank of a river that winds its way near Kampur. The whole area is low-lying and is usually flooded during rains. Fairly extensive grazing area is available in the marshy banks of the river and around low lying pools where buffaloes graze and lie down for rest in the stagnant water for some part of the day. Symptoms Frequent shaking of the ear and sometimes slightly offensive odour near the animal, are first observed. Examination reveals the inflamatory condition at the base of the ear near about the meatus while the external ear becomes more or less thickened presenting cracked surface of the skin. Appetite is diminished and there is definite decrease in milk yield. The inflammed area shows numerous minute pin-point congested spots. Frequent rubbing or scratching of the ear to poles or trees is often seen. One or both the ears are affected. If one ear is affected the animal holds its head side ways with the diseased ear down. Slight watery discharge is observed at the early stage which later becomes purulent, light or dirty yellow in colour with offensive odour. Sometimes ulceration of lining of the ear is seen. The exudate is occasionally streaked with blood. There is usually extraneous infection. The animal shows much pain when handled. Occasionally pharyngitis and congestion of the nasal mucous membrane with profuse discharge, are noticed. Submaxillary lymph glands become sowllen. Neglected cases become fly-blown and even maggots are formed. In severe cases, when both ears are affected there is constitutional disturbance which interferes with the working capacity of the
December, 1948] V. R. GOPALAKRISHNAN 229 animal. A large number of cases are usually seen in working animals, i.e., male buffaloes. They are mainly used for field work such as ploughing and for carts. During the rest period of the day they often remain in miry and marshy places near water-ways. This habit, to a certain extent, seems to retard the improvement in treated cases. The condition usually becomes chronic and often remains quiescent in the cold season. Generally active lesions reappear during rains, the monsoon weather being most favourable. Several cases were examined in various localities during the rainy and winter seasons, to study the differential characters of the lessions in the active and quiescent stages. The symptoms described above refer to the active stage in the rainy season. In winter, the lesions become inactive and appear more or less dry. The surface presents a healthier appearance and there is less local irrita- tion. In fact, the animal does not manifest any inconvenience or pain. Parasites have been re- covered from all the cases though their number from these cases may be less. When the lesions are active, more parasites are obtained from the scrapings. The disease usually runs a slow course of two to three weeks or more. Generally one ear is affected and sometimes both are involved. Recovery ordinarily takes place and there is rarely any mortality. Collection of scrapings Scrapings are collected from the affected part after cleaning the surface with normal saline solution. A blunt scalpel or a curette will serve the purpose. Certain observations regarding the collection of adult worms from fresh scrapings are worthy of note. While scraping affected areas or lesions, it is not uncommon that a portion of the parasite protrudes from the scraped surface. Dropping a small quantity of saline over the area, removes the oozing blood, thus exposing more distinctly the adherent parasite which can be gently removed with a pair of forceps or camel-hair brush. Besides, when scrapings are collected in normal saline in a Petri-dish, the worm could be found embedded in a piece of scraped tissue, sometimes with a portion of it protuding. A careful teasing of the clumps of the scrapings dislodges the worm. While examining the worm under micro- scope, it is not infrequent that the anterior extrimity is covered with fragments of tissue. Laboratory findings Scrapings and smear preparations were examined in all the cases that were investigated. From the scrapings adult nematode worms, both male and female, have invariably been recovered for examination. As usual in Filariidae, female parasites were found longer than the male ones. Smear preparations have revealed numerous microfilariae. These preparations have been examined fresh as well as stained with Leishman stain. In wet smears, the microfilaria is coiled up inside an egg- like membrane. In stained smears, free forms are detected. The morphological characters of the parasite have been found apparently identical with those of Stephanofilaria assamensis causing hump- sore of cattle as recorded by Pande [1936]. Further, with the object of getting the findings confirmed, collection of worms from the ear scrapings was sent to the Officer in-charge, Veterinary Zoology Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, and it has been identified as belonging to Stephanofilaria (sp). Besides, specimens of worms from further cases were sent to the Officer-in-charge, Helminthiasis Scheme, Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, Lucknow University, Lucknow, and these too were identified as Stephanofilaria (sp). In the smear preparations, in addition to microfilaria, various organisms have been seen, such as cocci, fungi, acari parasites, etc. These are considered saprophytic or secondary invaders in view of the anatomical position of the parts affected ; nor is their presence constant in all cases. Transmission of the disease Experimental transmission or reproduction has not been successful so far. In view of the seasonal occurrence of the disease, insects must be considered to be the probable vectors of the

GOPALAKRISHNAN 231 SUMMARY Details are given of investigation of Stephanofilariasis among buffaloes in Assam and of its occurrence as a specific cutaneous microfilariasis of the ear. The disease usually occurs sporadically but at times, it prevails in the form of an epidemic. Full particulars of its seasonal occurrence and localities affected, are given. Symptoms, course, means of control and treatment are described. The disease is generally confined to buffaloes. It is very rarely fatal though the incidence of affected animals in an outbreak varies from 20 to 50 per cent. The causal parasite, both mocrofilaria and adult nematode, has been recovered from the lesion of ear-sore. The morphological characters of the parasite have been found apparently identicals with those of Stephanofilaria assemensis [Pande 1936], causing hump-sore of cattle in India. The findings have been confirmed by Mukteswar Institute and by Officer-in-charge, Helminthiasis Scheme, Lucknow University. Skin affections of cattle in India and elsewhere, caused by Stephanofilaria sp., are cited. The occurrence of Stephanofilaria sp. in buffaloPREPARATION OF VEGETABLE RENNET FROM WITHANIA COAGULANS, DUNAL By NOSHIR. N. DASTUR, K. N. SHAMA SASTRY AND D. VENKATAPPIAH, Indian Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 18 June 1948) AN enzyme which can be used in the place of animal rennet in the preparation of cheese will prove very useful taking into consideration the particular food habits of our population. The berries of Withania coagulans, Dunal, are known to contain an active material useful for this purpose [Lea, 1883-84]. Recently Kothavalla and Khubchandani [1940] used a saline extract of Withania coagulans for preparing cheeses. These authors used a temperature of 105°F. for coagulation. Some difficulty in preparing hard cheeses of satisfactory quality was experienced as they developed open texture. Narain and Singh [1943] have described the properties of alcohol precipitated enzyme and also used this material for making Cheddar cheese. Since Kothavalla and Khubchandani carried out their work at this Institute, further experiments have been in progress with the object of isolating an enzyme which can be used in place of animal rennet, under the accepted working conditions. The results of this work are described here. EXPERIMENTAL (a) Preparation of extract. Preliminary trials were carried out to find out where the enzyme material is stored in the plant. Leaves and stems of the plant and seeds from the berries were found to be devoid of all enzyme material. The pulp in the berries was the most active source of milk clotting enzyme, and the aqueous extract of the outer husk of the berries had about a third of the activity of the pulp. For experimental work, an extract of the whole berries was used as it was very tedious to remove the seeds embedded in the pulp and the weight of husk in relation to the pulp was very small. For extracting the enzyme, various materials in different concentrations were tried, viz., water, NaCl (0.3 to 10 per cent), Na2CO3 (5 per cent), glycerine, alcohol (5 per cent), HCl (1-5 per cent), CaO (1 per cent) and CaCl2 (0.3-2 per cent). Distilled water and 1 per cent NaCl proved most suitable. The extraction was carried out as follows : 1,000 gm. of berries were ground with about 750 ml. of water to a thin paste. This was centrifuged when a considerable amount of insoluble material settle down. The top liquid was opaque brown. The residue was washed twice with water and separated in the manner described. The total quantity of water used was 850 ml. and the yield after centrifuging was about 700 ml. The extract was quite stable at room temperature even without any antiseptics. On storage, both in cold and at room temperature, some insoluble material deposited from the extract. The precipitate formed was completely inactive and the removal of this deposit by centrifuging had no effect on the activity of the supernatant liquid. Various preservatives were added to see if these would prevent the formation of the precipitate. The substance tested included borax (0.5 per cent), boric acid (1 per cent), mustard oil (1 per cent), glycerine (5-10 per cent). NaCl (5-10 per cent), alcohol (5 per cent) toluence and combinations of some of these. None of these preservatives was able to prevent the formation of the precipitate. (b) Determination of activity. Activity was determined using milk substrate at a temperature of 37°C. Fresh milk, and milk adjusted to an acidity of 0.2 per cent lactic acid by adding a suitable quantity of 0.25 N pure lactic acid solution, were used. This acidity was adopted as this is the acidity in milk normally used for cheese making. One ml, of rennet solution under test was added to 50 ml. of milk and time of clotting when first flakes began to appear was noted in seconds. Each result given in the subsequent Tables represents the mean of two observations. 233 H
234 Preparation of Vegetable Rennet [Vol. XVIII, Part IV At a later stage it was found that CaCl2 enhances the activity of the enzyme and so milk was fortified with Ca by adding 2 ml. of 12.33 per cent CaCl2 solution to 98 ml. of milk. (c) Concentration of the enzyme (i) Concentration under vacuum. Attempts were made to concentrate the enzyme by distilling off water under vacuum at 40-45°C. A heavy froth was produced during distillation. In the end a thick pasty mass was obtained resembling molasses in appearance. Attempts were made to dry this material over sulphuric acid under vacuum without success. Eight hundred and fifty gramms of the aqueous extract gave nearly 275 gm. of the concentrate after vacuum distillation and drying. This method was abandoned as it did not promise to give useful results. (ii) Precipitation with acids and alkalies. When the aqueous extract was treated with dilute H2SO4, HCl, NH4OH and NaOH, no precipitation occurred. (iii) Precipitation with salts. Sodium chloride, ammonium sulphate and magnesium sulphate were used for this purpose 1,000 ml. of aqueous extract required 350 gm. of NaCl for complete precipita- tion of the precipitable matter. Some precipitate was obtained at 20.8 and 38.4 per cent ammonium sulphate but the bulk of the precipitate was at 39.0 per cent concentration. Magnesium sulphate gave precipitates at 22 per cent and 53 per cent concentrations. With each of the above precipitants, when complete precipitation had occurred the clear supernatant liquid was decanted off and the solution containing the precipitate was dialyzed after adding some toluence. When the dialysate was free from the added salt, the bag containing the material was removed and the contents trans- ferred to a measuring flask of 250 ml. capacity and made up to the mark. During the process of dialyzing some precipitate was formed which did not go in solution and which was inactive. For the determination of activity, the whole suspension was used in each case. The results showed that in no case was a highly active material obtained. As this method of precipitation was likely to prove tedious under commercial conditions, it was not perused further. (iv) Precipitation with organic solvents (a) Precipitation with alcohol. Each 100 ml. of water extract required 250 ml. of absolute alcohol for precipitation of the active enzyme. First signs of a precipitate occurred after 160 ml. of alcohol were added. By this method about 9 gm. of dry powder was obtained from 100 ml. of aqueous extract. Larger yields could be obtained by adding more alcohol to the supernatant liquid but the precipitate formed was quite inactive. The enzyme powder was not completely soluble in water and on keeping, insoluble matter settled down. The alcohol precipitate had good milk clotting properties as shown in the following Table. 4 per cent solution of Clotting time of milk adjusted to 0.2 per cent lactic acid Sample I . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 61 Sample II . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 63 Animal Rennot . . . . . . . . . . 65 The results show that it is possible to get an active enzyme by this treatment. Similar results have been reported by Narain and Singh [1943]. (b) Precipitation with acetone. By trials it was found that the optimum amount of acetone to be added was two volumes to one volume of aqueous extract. Aqueous solution of Withania coagulans of different strength were made and precipitated with acetone. It was observed that the enzyme precipitated from dilute solutions was more active. Extraction of Withania coagulans berries with a 5 per cent CaCl2 solution and adding acetone to this extract gave a completely inactive product.
December 1948] NOSHIR N. DASTUR, et al 235 Attempts were also made to first precipitate the enzyme with NaCl, (NH4)2 SO4 and MgSO4, dissolve the salt free precipitates in H2O and then again precipitate with acetone. The precipitates so obtained did not prove more active than the enzyme obtained by precipitation from the original water extract. The final process evolved for the preparation of the enzyme by acetone precipitation was as follows : 1,000 gm. of Withania coagulans berries were extracted with two volumes of H2O and centrifuged when a clear extract was obtained. One volume of this extract was treated with two volumes of acetone with stirring. After about 15 minutes, the supernatant liquid was decanted off and the precipitate washed two to three times with a little acetone. It was then dried over H2SO4 under vacuum. 1,000 ml. of extract gave 10-15 gm. of a grayish powder, which was quite stable even when stored at room temperature. To enhance the activity of this concentrate, one part of the dry enzyme was mixed with two and a half times its weight of anhydrous CaCl2. The activity of the material obtained as above can be increased by dissolving it in water and reprecipitating with acetone as shown below, but for studies described here only the once precipi- tated enzyme was used.

Vegetable rennet was dissolved in 12.33 per cent CaCl2. The activities were compared at 37°C. and 45°C., the latter as shown later, was the optimum temperature for vegetable rennet. TABLE I Comparative activity of vegetable and animal rennets (expressed as time taken to curdle 50 ml. of milk by 1 ml. of rennet solution) At 37°C. At 45°C.

On this basis it is estimated that one part of the vegetable rennet will coagulate 90,800 parts of milk in nearly 30 minutes. (d) Properties of Withania coagulans enzyme (i) Optimum temperature : A 5 per cent solution of the enzyme in 12.33 per cent CaCl2 was used. Side by side, trials were also made with a 10 per cent solution of Hansen's liquid rennet for comparison. The results are shown in Table II.

236 Preparation of Vegetable Rennet [Vol. XVIII, Part IV The optimum temperature of the vegetable rennet was between 45-65°C. The optimum tempera- ture of the animal product also lay within the same range. At temperature below 45°C. the activity of vegetable rennet was markedly affected and at 37°C. it was only about a third of the activity at 45°C. The activity of the animal rennet was affected comparatively to a small degree by changes in temperatures within the range indicated. (ii) Effect of pH. Milk was adjusted to different acidities and the pH determined using quin- hydrone electrode. The enzyme solutions were of the strength indicated before. TABLE III Optimum pH. of Withania coagulans enzyme Acidity of (per cent lactic) Milk Trial No. 1 Trial No. 2 pH Vegetable rennet Animal rennet pH Vegetable rennet Animal rennet (Coagulation time in seconds) (Coagulation time in seconds) 0.12 6.80 100 100 6.60 93 90 0.14 6.68 99 79 6.48 85 65 0.16 6.56 75 47 6.35 75 47 0.18 6.46 67 38 6.22 67 40 0.20 6.38 62 30 6.11 62 35 0.22 6.24 55 25 6.01 58 32 With the increase in acidity, the time of coagulation was found to decrease both with vegetable and animal rennets. This increase in activity was more in the case of animal product. (iii) Effect of heat. 10 ml. of solutions of vegetable and animal enzymes were placed in a test tube and the tube immersed in a beaker of water maintained at a particular temperature. After the solution had attained the required temperature, it was maintained at that temperature for 5 minutes. The results are shown in Table IV. TABLE IV Effect of heat on rennets December 1948] NOSHIR N. DASTUR, et al. 237 The results show that both the vegetable and animal rennets are sensitive to heat. Heating over 50°C. even for short duration, effects the activity of the solutions of these rennets adversely. (iv) Effect of using boiled milk. Milk was brought to first boil and then allowed to cool to 37°C. As substrates milk and milk containing CaCl2 were used. The results are given in Table V.

The figures for the relative time for the coagulation of cow and buffalo milk are interesting. Buffalo milk on an average was found to take less time for coagulation either with animal or vegetable rennets. (v) Effect of various absorbents. A 5 per cent aqueous solution of acetone precipitated enzyme was used. 50 ml. of this solution were treated at room temperature with 5 per cent of the follow- ing :238 Preparation of Vegetable Rennet [Vol. XVIII, Part IV TABLE VI Activity of vegetable rennet solutions treated with absorbants Original solution Vegetable rennet solution treated with 5 per cent of Animal charcoal Rice husk charcoal Fuller's earth Kaolin Aluminium oxide Calcium carbonate Calcium hydroxide Kiesulghar (Coagulation time in seconds) 149 231 152 305 243 166 160 Over 1,200 229 It was found that Ca(OH)2 wholly destroyed the activity of the filtrate. Similar results were obtained even with 1 per cent Ca(OH)2. Fuller's earth, Kiesulghar, Kaolin and animal charcoal, calcium carbonate and aluminium oxide and rice husk charcoal decreased the activity in the order mentioned. Attempts were made to extract the enzyme from these absorbents with various media without success. Some of the absorbents were alkaline and so the filtrate obtained was acidified and then the activity tested. Still the solutions did not show enhanced activity. (vi) Toxicity of Withania coagulans extract. This was tested with rats. Four young male rats were fed 4 ml. of a 10 per cent extract of the berries for a period of ten weeks. An equal number of animals were kept as controls. The weight of animals was recorded. No difference was found in the growth rate of control and experimental groups of animals. It was concluded that the extract of the berries was non-toxic. (vii) Effect of different salts and sunlight. That calcium chloride considerably enhances the activity of the Withania coagulans enzyme has been indicated previously. Effect of other inorganic salts was investigated. Amongst the salts tried were ZnCl2 (0.004 per cent), KI (0.005 per cent). Cu2O (0.04 per cent) and bleaching powder (0.04 per cent). The salt to be tested was added to milk. Vegetable rennet solution was made in 12.33 per cent CaCl2. The results are given in Table VII.

DASTUR, et al 239 (viii) Preparation of cheese. Both soft (Surti panir) and hard (Chaddar) cheeses were prepared from various concentrates of Withania coagulans obtained from time to time. As promising results were obtained in the beginning with the vegetable rennet, no attempt was made to deviate from the standard technique followed with animal rennet. A few difficulties were encountered in the begin- ning but these were gradually overcome. It will, however, be interesting to record some of the main defects encountered in the beginning for information. (a) Soft cheese. The texture was very crumbly. Cheese when kept dipped in whey gradually became thinned at the edges. (b) Hard cheese. Cheese developed open texture on keeping. There was a bitter and biting taste which made the product unpalatable. Cheese was soft and would not cut clean. As better quality rennet material was obtained, these difficulties were gradually overcome and it was possible to make as good a soft cheese with vegetable rennet as with the product obtained from animal source. A summary of a comparative operation for the manufacture of Surti panir is shown in Table VIII. The method of preparation of Surti panir has been described in detail by Kothavalla and Verma [1942] and was followed in the present investigation. For dipping vegetable rennet cheese, various media, including animal rennet whey, 1.5 per cent salt solution, 0.05 per cent lactic acid solution in 1.5 per cent NaCl, were tried and in the end it was found that vegetable rennet whey obtained during the operation was the most satisfactory.

On the whole Surti panir prepared by animal and vegetable rennets were indistinguishable. Trials were also carried out to prepare Chaddar cheese with vegetable rennet. By trials it was observed that longer time is required for the ripening of Chadder cheese made with Withania coagulans and it should possibly be extended to six months. As the time of ripening increased, the bitter taste diminished. It has, however, not been possible to remedy this defect completely. Further work is in progress to purify the enzyme and it is hoped that it will be then possible to get over this difficulty.
240 Preparation of Vegetable Rennet [Vol. XVIII, Part IV SUMMARY 1. Seeds, leaves and stems of Withania coagulans show no milk clotting property. The pulp o the berries was the most active source of the enzyme. A little activity was also shown by the outer husk. 2. For the preparation of an enzyme concentrate, the enzyme was first extracted with wate and then precipitated with two volumes of acetone. The activity of the acetone precipitated enzym compared well with that of Hansen's liquid and powder rennets. 3. The optimum temperature of Withania coagulans enzyme lay between 45-65°C. At higher temperatures than 70°C., the activity of the enzyme decreased rapidly and it was completely inactive at 80°C. 4. The activity of the enzyme increased with an increase in the activity of milk. 5. Boiled milk took a longer time to clot but the lost activity could be restored to a large measure by adding calcium chloride. 6. Withania coagulans extract is non-toxic. 7. Different absorbents decrease the activity to different degrees. 8. Soft cheese of a quality indistinguishable from that made with animal rennet was prepared.

Whey was daily collected from the market and its calcium content was found to range between 0.62 to 1.3 mg. per c.c. The results of metabolic experiments with human subject and rats are presented in Table II from which it is observed that both the subjects J. C. D. and K. N. S. maintained negative calcium balance when living on poor vegetarian rice diet. The average intake and balance of calcium on rice diet was found to be 237.1 mgm. andDecember 1948] H. N. DE AND A. B. SOM 243 The higher utilization value of whey calcium above 80 per cent observed here in both human and rat experiment may be due to the presence of sufficient quantity of lactic acid in it. It has previously been pointed out that about 1,200 tons of whey is daily thrown away as waste in Bengal. Taking the average calcium content of whey as 0.7 mg. per c.c., the net utilizable calcium wasted away daily along with whey is approximately 9 tons. If 200 c.c. of whey is given as food supplement to each adult, the above quantity of whey can make up the deficiency of 5.5 million people of Bengal. So for practical nutrition, whey thrown away as waste in the production of sweets for rich section of the people may be used as a calcium supplement for the poor and the present work opens a new avenue for the fortification of poor Indian diets. SUMMARY Administration of 200 c.c. of whey with the poor rice diet would supply about 137 mg. of extra calcium and make up the deficiency of the rice diet with regard to this essential element. By both, rat and human experiments the percentage utilization of the whey, calcium was found between 80 to 90 per cent. REFERENCES Basu, K. P., Basak, M. N. and De, H. N. (1942). Ind. Jour, Med.

The general conclusions arrived at were thus summarized by Hora in his concluding remarks: ' The flooded condition of a river or a tank is the primary factor that is responsible for the spawning of Indian carps. It has also been brought out that intensive flooding capable of inundating vast shallow areas, which form the spawning grounds of fish, could only induce the spawning of Indian Carps. By creating floods artificially, which should be of sufficient intensity so as to inundate spawning grounds, at Radhanagar, Midnapore and at Satkania, Chittagong, it has been possible to induce spawning and reversely when low floods in the Punjab did not inundate spawning grounds, the fish refused to come out for spawning though they were sexually mature. The high pH and oxygen content value of water are a necessary corollary to floods but have no independent value in inducing spawning. Both pH value and oxygen tension could be artificially controlled, but it will generally be conceded that these factors by themselves have no value unless the spawning grounds are covered for some time, so as to enable fish to induce in amorous play, liberate eggs and give sufficient warmth for the helpless larvae to pass a few days of their life in the seclusion and rich pasturage characteristic of shallow waters. One other factor of importance which seems to affect spawning independently of floods, is the temperature. It has been observed in the Pubjab that as soon as the temperature rose from 76°F. to 96°F., the fish, which had responded to the floods, deserted the spawning grounds. Similarly, Das and Das Gupta found that in the Kurkuti Bundh, Midnapore, so long as the temperature was above 84°F. two batches of fish were induced to spawn successfully but the third batch refused to spawn as the temperature had fallen to 81°F. Mr Langdale Smith's observations on the breeding of Mahseer and from our knowledge of the factors influencing the spawning of European Carp, it is also clear that temperature is a factor of considerable importance.' From the observations recorded below regarding the probable breeding of Catla in the Khakhra 'Dhand', it would appear that flood is undoubtably a primary factor though it is not caused by the monsoon rains but by the melting of snow. Unfortunately no regular records of temperature were maintained but from the analysis of total salts and pH given here it is clear that waters of the 'Dhand' undergo considerable variation in these respects at the time of the breeding of the fish. THE KHAKHRA 'DHAND' The Khakhra ' Dhand' is situated in the course of the Khakhra tributary of the Sutlej river and is an extensive low, marshy area, situated in the jurisdiction of the village Bhangala, near Valtoha Railway station, in the District of Amritsar. It is one and a half miles long and at least quarter of a mile broad during the flood season, but during the dry season its breadth shrinks and is not more than one hundred yards. It is connected with the river Sutlej by a perennial channel which is about a mile in length, and is fed by the Khakhra 'Dhand'. 1. Proc. Nat. Inst. Sci. India, IX, pp. 303-330 (1945) 245 K
246 Khakhra Dhand in the Punjab [Vol. XVIII,Part IV Khakhra tributary in which, the Khakhra 'Dhand' lies, is the old bed of the river Beas. The rivers Sutlej and Beas at one time flowed parallel to each other for a considerable distance in the districts of Amritsar, Lahore and Montgomery. As the river Beas now falls into river Sutlej at ' Hari-ke-Pattan', about twenty miles above the confluence of the channel of the Khakhra tributary into the river Sutlej, the Khakhra tributary serves as a drain of the low-lying area between the river Sutlei and the old bed of the river Beas. The level of the water in the Khakhra 'dhand' and the channel of the Khakhra tributary rises, as the level of the water in the river Sutlej gets higher due to the melting of snow, ultimately flooding the fields lying on either side of the channel and some part of the 'dhand'. Apart from the Khakhra 'dhand', a few more big pools are found in the Khakhra tributary in its upper reaches. But, they are not appreciably affected by the rise of level in the river Sutlej during the floods. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 1. Khakhra Dhand the spawning ground for Catla and other carps Evidence of Catla breeding in the 'Dhand' The actual courtship, wed-lock and spawning have not been observed, but the following facts indicate fairly clearly that the fish breeds in the 'dhand'. 1. Large-sized Catla, presumably sexually mature, have been observed entering the 'Dhands' from the river Sutlej in the month of June. 2. Spent Catla have been caught while going down to the river in September. 3. Sixty per cent of the fish population of the 'dhand' consists of young Catla. 4. Flooding of the river and in consequence of the channel and the 'dhand' takes place in June and July owing to the melting of the snow, but independent of monsoon rains. As floods due to melting of snow occur every year, the spawning also occurs in the 'Dhand' every year. 5. The sides of the channel as well as of the 'dhand' provide suitable spawning beds when covered with flood water. 6. The temperature never rises above 90°F., and is therefore, suitable for Catla spawning.

Catla fry of very small size (half an inch in length) were seen in large numbers in a part of the 'dhand' during the last week of June, 1946. The tiny Catla fry grow and live in Khakhra 'dhand' from the time of hatching till the next year. Most of the fry die in April, if not removed earlier. The death is brought about due to the lack of oxygen in the 'dhand' water when decomposition of the organic matter takes place. Most of the algae and other aquatic plants, viz., Potamogeton pectinatus, die during April on account of the high concentration of salts in the 'dhand' water. By then, the fry or the fingerlings which happen to survive, become ten to twelve months old, and when fresh water from the river enters the 'dhand' during the month of June, the yearlings leave the 'dhand'. We get a fresh supply of the fry from the eggs laid by Catla and other carps during the months June-July. Adult Catla of the river, most probably, enter the 'dhand' due to their liking for the brackish water, when the water-level of the river rises. The fields lying in between the river and the 'dhand' serve as spawning ground for the adult Catla during the flow of water from the river to the 'dhand'. The continuous supply of fresh water from the river keeps the temperature of 'dhand' water sufficiently low, and helps the tiny fry, to a great extent, in its struggle for existence. SUMMARY Due to the restricted distribution of Catla in the rivers and streams of the Punjab, its spawning has not so far been studied. The presence of Catla fry in large numbers in certain 'dhands' and pools is an indication of the spawning of Catla in those places. Catla is not known to breed in confined waters. Catla fry formed 60 per cent of the fish population of Khakhra 'dhand'. It is not found anywhere else in such a great number throughout the Punjab. Adult Catla is not present in this 'dhand' before the spawning season. The spawning of Catla in this place is independent of the local rains. It takes place during the month of June or July. The fields lying in between the river and the 'dhand' are inundated when the level of Sutlej river-water rises due to the melting of snow and rains in the hills. Catla present in the river are most probably attracted by the saline water of the 'dhand', and during their journey from the river to the 'dhand' they spawn in the inundated fields. The spent-up Catla leave the 'dhand' when the water from the 'dhand' and the inundated fields recedes. The temperature of the 'dhand' water remains suitable for the spawning of Catla, as it is kept low by the inrush of fresh water from the river. The low temperature of the 'dhand' water also helps the tiny fry in their struggle for existence during the hot months.
DETECTION OF ARSENICAL POISONING IN AN EXHUMED CARCASE By M. RAMAKRISHNAN, G.M.V.C., Veterinary Investigation Officer. Madras (Received for publication on 1 March 1948) ARSENICAL poisoning in animals as well as in human beings is quite common, but a record of cases in animals where the carcases have been exhumed are rare or almost absent. The object of this note is to record one such investigation. It was reported in the Indian Express of 23 September 1947, that a thousand head of cattle had died of poisoning in Ottapalem area in Malabar District but on confirmation, however, it was found that only cattle worth 1,000 rupees had died. Arsenical poisoning of malicious nature was suspected because of the value of the skins that would become available on death of animals. It was stated that after some deaths, carcases were buried, thereby preventing the interested parties for having access to the skins and that, this precautionary measure resulted in the stoppage of such deaths. No detailed investigation was intended because it was thought that the carcases would be several days old and that it would be difficult to make out any organs or structure or to get material for chemical analysis. Mr Hurley, the Director however considered that it would be useful to conduct one or two postmortem examinations since arsenic is suspected and that the carcases might still be in a state of preservation. HISTORY Twenty two animals had died after an illness of one to two days duration in the course of about a month. No occurrence of any contagious disease during that period was reported. The symptoms mentioned by the ryots were highly suggestive of arsenical poisoning. The poison was said to be concealed in jack fruits left in the grazing areas, for the animals to ingest, while grazing. Postmortem The carcase of an animal that had died most recently was selected and examined. The animal was a dark brown bullock252 Arsenical Poisoning in an Exhumed Carcase [Vol. XVIII, Part IV, usual size and the auricles and ventricles were empty. Blood vessels were normal. Lungs decomposed and partly liquefied. Nothing unusual was noticed in trachea, larynx and glottis. Liver was contracted and hardened with capsules intact; consistency was a little harder than normal and gall bladder was empty. Spleen was highly decomposed and jelly-like, but retained its form and size with its capsule intact. Kidneys were jelly-like and decomposed. Oesophagus was also decomposed. The four compartments of the stomach were still intact and could be separately made out. Rumen contained the usual amount of ingesta in an almost dried up state with the usual colour. The contents of the other three compartments were drier than normal and decidedly darker. The inner lining of the three compartments was black. Small intestines were contracted and tumified, almost empty and mucus lining was darker than normal. Large intestines were also contracted and tumified and contained hard dry dung. Nothing unusual was noticed in the lymphatic glands, bladder or generative organs. Brain and spinal cord were liquefied and jelly-like. It was, thus obvious, that the carcase was contracted and in mummified condition and the skin and the hair were intact. There was absence of postmortem changes in the tongue which was normal in colour and consistency. The liver was contracted and hardened and seemed to be in a fair state of preservation. The condition of the heart and stomach and the intestines also signified that they were contracted and tumified and not decomposed. There was absence of maggot formation. Diagnosis Arsenical poisoning was suspected. The contents of stomach, including that of the rumen and bits of liver and intestines preserved in rectified spirit with a control sample of rectified spirit, were sent to the Chemical Examiner, who detected arsenic in all the samples, except the control one. DISCUSSION As stated in the beginning, the cases of malicious arsenical poisoning of cattle have been fre- quently met with, in the past in this country. The chief motive is the procurement of the skin, though ill feelings, personal jealousies and quarrels among villagers often play a part. The crime is invariably perpetrated by the Chamars or chucklers either on their own initiative or at the instiga- tion of others. The other poisons used are mercury, and vegetable, but arsenic is the most commonly used because of the smallness of its dose and the convenience of administration, and easy availability. According to Hehir and Gribble [1929] there were 283 cases of arsenical poisoning out of the total of 293, during the five years from 1885 to 1889. Cases of exhumation are comparatively rare or even absent. In cases of human beings there are quite a few records specially where the bodies have been buried either enclosed in a coffin or free. In animals there are rare cases of burial or cremation, because of the usual practice of skinning the carcase and discarding the remains. From a reference to the statistics available with the Chemical Examiner to the Government of Madras from 1942 to 1946, 15 cattle and 23 human beings were diagnozed against arsenical poisoning and except for one case in human beings no carcase was exhumed. In passing, the preservative qualities of arsenic may be mentioned. Macfall [1925] has mentioned in this connection that arsenic is an indestructible poison and may be found in the body after many years ; in one case it was found after 14 years. Whitford [1884] records, that the body in one case was found remarkably preserved for a period of 37½ months after internment. Jai Singh and P. Modi [1945] state that the body of Full Ham of Agra was found to be well preserved when it was exhumed 14 months after death, even though the grave was a kutcha one and the lid of the coffin had already given way. Apparently, in the carcase of the bull exhumed, it was the preservative effect of the arsenic that had resulted in the prevention of putrefaction and preservation of some of the organs. The appearances met with, in the different organs, are very varied and interesting, particularly indicating the relation to their distribution of arsenic in the various tissues and body fluids. While the skin with hairs, tongue, heart, liver and all the four compartments of the stomach and intestines were in the state of fair preservation, the skeletal muscles, lungs, spleen, kidneys and brain had
December 1948] R. RAMAKRISHNAN 253 undergone decomposition and complete softening approaching liquefaction. John Glaister [1945] has mentioned in this connection, that arsenic quickly absorbed is stored in the liver and from there it passes to general circulation. Although the intestinal tract eliminates some of the arsenic from the body the kidneys are the principal excretory organs. From this it is evident that the liver is the main reservoir of the chemical, from where it passes on to the kidneys and intestines through circulation. The following Table from Glaister [1945] gives the distribution of Arsenic in the various tissues and body fluids.

FERGUSON, Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd., Jealott's Hill Research Station, Bracknell, Berks [Reprinted from The Journal of Agricultural Science Vol. 38 No. I January 1948] THE application of soluble nitrogenous fertilizers to a hay crop some 7-20 days before the crop is cut results in an increase in the protein content of the hay. In 12 experiments, Lewis [1941] showed that 1 cwt./acre of sulphate of ammonia, nitrate of soda or ' Nitro-Chalk ' gave an average increase of 1.0 per cent in the crude-protein content and with 2 cwt. fertilizer/acre the average increase was 1.75 per cent. He also showed that most of the extra nitrogen absorbed by the crops was converted into true protein and, with two minor exceptions, the proportions of nitrates and ammonia were undisturbed. Later Lewis [Jealott's Hill Report, unpublished] summarized the results obtained in 47 repli- cated experiments carried out in various parts of England and northern Ireland between 1938 and 1946. The nitrogen dressing used varied slightly. From 1935 to 1945, 1 and 2 cwt./acre 'Nitro- Chalk ' or sulphate of ammonia were applied and in 1946 1¼ and 2½ cwt./acre ' Nitro-Chalk '. The mean results obtained are given in Table I.

A direct comparison of the amino-acids present in late top-dressed hay and hay not top-dressed might yield circumstantial evidence on the nutritive value of the added protein, but no work on this line has been attempted. A comparative feeding trial using dairy cows or young stock is obviously desirable, but in view of the relatively small difference to be measured, a high or practically unattainable degree of accuracy would be necessary. The obvious necessity of a ration of minimal protein content adds to the difficulties of such a feeding trial. Since the major part of the added nitrogen is present in a form precipitable by alkaline copper hydroxide and therefore might be expected to be protein, polypeptides or certain amino-acids, it is thought that analysis supported by information on the digestibility of the protein should give a reasonable estimate of nutritive value of the protein in top-dressed hay. Such information is pre- sented in this paper. EXPERIMENTAL The hay was from a ley in its third year. It was a good crop consisting mainly of vigorous tye-grass with some leafy cocksfoot. The clover content was fairly low. A block of about 2 acres was top-dressed with 2 cwt. sulphate of ammonia, per acre on 31 May and cut on 13 June. Rain fell on the 11th day after the dressing, the total rainfall being 1.33 in. The weather was cool with bright intervals. No rain fell after the cutting, and the top-dressed and control hays were baled in the field on 19 and 20 June. The crop, and also the stubble after cutting, were noticeably greener on the top-dressed area. The digestibility of these hays was determined using three sheep for each hay. In 1946 the hay was made from old permanent grass, the herbage consisting mainly of meadow grasses with a little wild white clover. The botanical composition varied considerably over the field. The lay-out consisted of eight strips, each about 33 ft. wide, running the length of the field. Alternate strips were top-dressed with 3 cwt. ' Nitro-Chalk ' per acre. Yields of hay were measured, but as expected the top-dressing resulted in no increase in yield. Top-dressing was applied on 13 June and the crop was cut on 21 June. The hay was cocked on 27 June and baled on 1 July. Slight rain fell each day between 13 and 21 June, the total rainfall being 0.8 in. A further 0.9 in. of rain was recorded in 5 days between 21 and 28 June. The aftermath on the treated strips was markedly greener than that on the control strips. Digestibility trials were carried out on the two hays using four sheep for each hay. RESULTS Chemical composition of the hays The hays were sampled by selecting 10-12 bales at random from the main crops. These bales were opened and 7 lb. hay removed from two places in each bale. The samples were then chaffed, thoroughly mixed and used for the digestibility trials. Daily sub-samples were taken during the 10-day digestibility trials and these were composited for analysis. The compositions of the hays are given in Table II.

FERGUSON 259 The values have been adjusted for block differences, and comparison with one mean figure quoted in the Appendix shows these adjustments were very small. There were obviously no significant differences between the top-dressed and control hays as regards starch equivalent values, but the differences in protein equivalent values were highly signi- ficant. These were very similar in both hays and the top-dressing resulted in increases of 1.55 and 1.58 per cent protein equivalent. Throughout this paper the data have all been expressed on a dry-matter basis, and certain figures may be useful experessed on hay containing the average dry-matter cotent of 85 per cent given in Table VI.

Whether the ratio, increase of crude protein : increase of protein equivalent, 1 : 0.8, would hold whatever the res- ponse to top-dressing remains to be proven, but this does not appear unreasonable. The protein contents of the hays in this country are generally distressingly low and methods of increasing the level are desirable. The present work shows that a useful increase in ' apparent ' digestible protein results from late nitrogenous top-dressing. Even if part of the nitrogen is not ela- borated to protein in the plant it may still have appreciable feeding value for ruminants in view of the latter's ability to utilize non-protein nitrogenous substances. An additional benefit from the top-dressing is the stimulating effect on the growth of the after- math and it appears therefore that late top-dressing of the hay crop is a valuable practice which might be more generally applied.

Antimicrob. 11, 4-5, 222-275 [English summary] (Author's conclusions) THE normal saline wash of minced tissue constitutes a poor vaccine in general. Its effi- cacy is proportionate with the quantity of antigen extracted by the processes of mincing and washing by gathering this small quantity of antigen one does not obtain an increase of vaccinat- ing substance. Formalinized dried vaccine is superior to formalinized liquid vaccine even when the latter is freshly prepared ; the first vaccine best conserves its potency at 25-30°C. and the latter at 6°C. Formalinized dried vaccine maintained at laboratory temperature is somewhat inferior to toluene vaccine maintained under the same conditions. The immunity conferred by the dry vaccine is almost of the same duration as the immunity conferred by toluene vaccine but the results of vaccination are probably more uniform with the former ; dry formalinized vaccine gives a more lasting immunity than the ordinary liquid formali- nized vaccine. In the same conditions of concentration of the virus, whether it be in the form of a powder or a saline extract, the dry vaccine has a much smaller volume; this is an advantage which favours its use in certain circumstances. However, such circumstances are not always encountered in prac- tice ; particularly in Indo-China vaccination in the field has to be carried out by subordinate staff to whom the vaccine is sent from the nearest veterinary field dispensary. There is an additional disadvantage in that the dry vaccine forms clumps when water is added to the powder and this not only makes vaccination difficult but also the assessment of the actual quantity of the vaccine inoculated. This is the reason for our present opinion that a formalinized adsorbed alumgel vaccine is much to be preferred in field practice. [J. F. S.] Jacotot, H. (1947). Etude du vaccine contre la peste bozine (2nd memoire). Les techniques vaccination. Rev. d'Immun. Ther. Antimicrob. 11, 6, 329-381. (Author's summary and conclusions) THERE is no reason to doubt or even question the conclusion that rinderpest vaccines pre- pared from formalinized emulsions of the tissues of a bovine experimentally or otherwise injected with the virus of rinderpest contains living virus ; such vaccines nevertheless pos- sess strong and uniform immunizing properties. Other things being equal, such as the methods of preparation of the vaccines and the actual concentration of tissues in the emulsion, vaccine prepared from lymph gland tissue is approximately twice as potent as that prepared from spleen pulp and at least four times as active antigenically as that made from lung pulp. Even the intestinal mucosa may be used in vaccine preparation, the necrotic portion especially having a higher antigenic value than spleen pulp. The small pox lymph obtained from she buffaloes or heifers inoculated both with rinderpest virus and lymph vaccine possesses an antigenic value almost comparable with fresh rinderpest virus and of greater potency that spleen pulp. Liver and testicular tissues are antigeni- cally inactive or at the best have but feeble immunizing value and are valueless in the prepa- ration of rinderpest vaccine. The antigenic value of the selected tissues of calves artificially infected with virus is nil during the period of inoculation ; it is evident, though very feeble, at the first day of fever and reaches its maximum with the maximum temperature reaction, or very shortly after ; it remains at this level for two or three days then diminishes until at about the tenth day it is hardly demonstrable. 263 O
264 ABSTRACT [Vol. XVIII, Part IV, There is a relationship between the antigenic value of the tissues and their actual virus content but it is probable that they owe their antigenic properties to the manner in which the virus is attached to certain component cells. It is not necessary that an animal inoculated with rinderpest virus should show a reaction so that the tissues are suitable for vaccine production. The antigenic value of those tissues is as good as in animal reacting fully. The deterioration of rinderpest vaccine is shown both by its failure to produce immunity and the irregular reaction in vaccinated animals. A low storage temperature is fundamentally necessary in the conservation of the full antigenic potency of emulsion vaccines. A toluine vaccine gives better results than a formalinized vaccine. It possesses stronger immunizing value, especially marked when freshly prepared, and antigenic qualities are better maintained in storage. Dried formalinized vaccine is better than liquid and retains its full potency better. It is somewhat inferior as a vaccine compared with toluine vaccine but it has the advantage of a small bulk and this balances, in practice in the field, its somewhat poorer antigenic value. It does not appear that the immunity following two vaccinations is any better than a single vaccination but the advantage of the former method is definitely apparent in the building of a stronger immunity in the week's following vaccination. The administration of the large quantity of vaccine notably prolongs the duration of immunity but after a period of eight months the benefit of massive inoculation is not so obvious. Comparing the results of vaccination with formalinized, toluine, and flourine vaccines inclines one to the belief that a relationship exists between the reaction at the site of inoculation and the duration of immunity conferred by the inoculation . The fact that a vaccinated animal can withstand a moderate test dose of virus does not infer that it can tolerate without severe reaction a larger test dose. An animal which has failed to react to several small test doses of virus will certainly react strongly to a large dose of the same virus. The quality of the vaccine, the dose given, the time elapsing after vaccination, the size of the test dose are, however, factors that operate in immunity. In animals vaccinated and tested by standard methods, 10-20 per cent of them remain or later become susceptible to infection with rinderpest virus. The antigenic value of a virulent pulp vaccines is generally feeble. The intravenous inoculation of a vaccine has no prophylactic value ; given in the incubation phase or in the preliminary febrile phase the vaccine will not avert the normal development of the disease. Consequent to vaccination with massive doses of formalinized vaccine the serum of some young cattle acquires a strongly prophylactic value. Young calves, the offspring of highly immunized cows, may be successfully immunized by means of a virulent spleen and other tissue extracts ; there is no incompatibility between the immunity of maternal origin which lasts until weaning and that resulting from a later vaccination. The addition of aluminium hydroxide to formalinized suspensions is an improvement. Vaccine adsorbed on aluminum gel gives a solid immunity with a tenth of the dose of the ordinary forma- linized vaccine used immediately on preparation and it also retains its antigenic value longer. Thus, the ratio of activity at the first test is 1/10, 1/15, 1/20 and on retest two to three months later 1/20, 1/30, 1/40, proviced that both vaccines under test have been subject to optimum storage temperatures. Absorbed vaccine possesses when just prepared and even on storage a uniformity of antigenic value that the other vaccine never possesses, even when freshly prepared. Tissue vaccines treated with aluminum gel are comparable in their antigenic power with ordinary tissue suspension vaccines, but their effect is slightly more durable. The increase of antigenic potency of the vaccine is directly related to the quantity of adjuvant incorporated in the vaccine ; 60 parts of pulp mixed with 100 parts of gel equivalent to 5.5 gm. aluminum hydroxide is the most satisfactory working ratio and fulfils all practical needs. The gel seems to exercise a double roll ; it stimulates the development of immunity (action on the tissues) and protects the formalinized pulp against deterioration (action on the vaccine). Between the years 1940-45, 55,000,000 c.c. gel rinderpest vaccine have been used in Indo-China and at least 2,000,000 cattle have been vaccinated. Wherever it has been properly used, the ad- sorbed vaccine has given the results expected of it. Of the practical results following the use of this vaccine, mention must be made of the saving of young cattle used for the provision of vaccine material, a ratio of almost 1/3 compared with the preparation of other tissue vaccines.

December 1948] ABSTRACT 265 Ralph W. Philliphs, Victor L. Simmons & Ralph G. Scohott. (1943.). Observations on the normal estrous cycle and breeding season in goats and possibilities of modification of the breeding season with gonadotropic hormones. Amer. Jour. Vet. Res. 4,360-367. THE observations recorded in the paper were made with a view to the production of milk throughout the year as the breeding season in goats is limited and goats milk only for five or six months during a lactation. To achieve this and certain possible means that can be exploited are : (a) Does may be bred at different times during the breeding season, (b) Select such does that come in estrus out-side the breed- ing season, (c) To bring about estrus by artificial means such as treatment with gonad stimulating hormones and, (d) Stimulation of lactation without gestation by use of lactogenic hormones. Literature has been quoted where extra seasonal breeding in goats have been induced by reduc- tion of light during the early part of summer and inducing lactation in virgin goats by injections of stilbestrol. In Swiss goats ovulation occurs during the months of October, November and December but may extend to other periods due to domestication ovulation occurs at regular intervals of three weeks. Whereas in Boer and Angora goats in S. Africa the breeding season is from April to August. The authors observations were mainly on the duration of breeding season, the length of estrous cycle and on the possibility of obtaining pregnancies in does outside the breeding season by means of gonadotropic hormones. Saanen and Toggenburg does and kids were used in study. The total number observed for estrus included 32 milking does, 20 dry does, 16 kids born in 1941 and 19 kids born in 1942. The obser- vations started from 20th October 1941 and lasted up to 13 December 1942. These observations indicate that most does will come in estrus between the middle of September and middle of December. A few, during July, August and early September and some in April, May and June. Estrous cycles were observed in milking and dry does and in the 1941 kids. A considerable number of estrous cycle fall in about 21 days. Shorter cycles of 12 days or less as well as longer ones which were multiples of 21 days were also observed. The average length of estrous cycles of 161 observations was 22.8 and 23 days in dry and milking does respectively and 16.6 days in kids. The results of hormone treatment with P. M. S. (pregnant mare serum) indicate that one injec- tion of 400 units will bring about estrus in dry does whereas lactating does require 400-600 units and even then they may not respond as readily as dry does. Of the 15 dry and 4 lactating does which came in estrus as a result of treatment with P. M. S. only six dry and one lactating doe conceived and. produced kids though all were bred while in estrus. The number is too small to arrive at a definite conclusion. A small trial with luteinizing hormone indicated that it may be helpful in stimulating ovulation at the proper time. [M. K.

PENICILLIN, the wonder drug, which enjoyed a period of unstinted praise as a drug of great value in the treatment of bacterial diseases in man and animals was found to have unanticipated limitations when more comprehensive and exacting tests were made with it in certain diseases. In this article, the authors deal with some of the limitations of penicillin in the treatment of bovine mastitis. In bovine mastitis it is necessary to determine the nature and type of infection by bacteriological methods before penicillin therapy is adopted. If the drug is used indiscriminately it will rapidly bring it into disrepute. In certain infections penicillin will have to be combined with other methods of treatment. The authors used penicillin in two outbreaks of acute mastitis due to Streptococcus agalactiae characterized by sudden onset and rapid spread of the disease terminating in atrophy or fibrosis of
266 ABSTRACT [Vol. XVIII, Part IV, the affected quarter and reduction of milk flow. In this type of infection the organism quickly penetrate the udder-parenchyma and as such penicillin fails to contact them effectively. It was found that from the stand-point of sterilizing the udder, in such cases penicillin was found to be dis- appointing. Clinically, however, the treatment resulted in marked physical improvement and the owners get satisfied consequently with the good results that ensue. The authors consider penicillin most effective in the treatment of chronic mastitis caused by Str. agalactiae where the infection is dormant. In these cases the infected quarters become free from infection and remain so for months and the milk yield increases in some cases. In the treatment of mastitis due to Staphylococcus aureus and Coryne-bacterium pyogenes, the efficacy of penicillin is dependent upon its immediate use in the early stages. In the later stages of these conditions, penicillin is valueless. [P. R. K. I] Minett, F. C. (1947). Effects of artificial showers, natural rain and wallowing on the body temperature of animals. J. Ani. Sci., 35-39. THE author carried out experiments to find out the extent of body heat loss by body wetting in buffaloes, zebu cattle, small hill cattle and sheep. The wetting methods employed were artificial showers, natural rain, wallowing, hosing and splashing. Chilling affects the well being of animals which explains the incidence of certain diseases during monsoon in India. A two hour's heavy shower in the morning lowers the body temperature of buffaloes by 2.8°F. and a similar shower in the afternoon lowers the body temperature of buffaloes and cows by 1.6ºF. and 0.5°F. respectively. The fall in buffaloes is during the shower and in cows during subsequent drying. Young buffaloes suffer more than adults. The body temperature fall under natural shower ranges between 0.7° to 2.7°F. in cows, 1.6 to 3.3°F. in hill cattle and 1.4° to 2.7°F. in sheep. The results clearly show the inefficiency of temperature control in the buffalo as compared with the zebu cow which is probably due to the protective coat in cows and the less efficient hyroid adrenal me- chanism in buffaloes. Body cooling or wallowing is indispensible for the buffalo in summer. Inclination to wallow is intense from July to October. Body cooling by hosing for three minutes is as good as wallowing for 20 minutes or one hour, but splashing for 10 minutes is not as effective. Wallowing by a previously- exercized animal reduces the body temperature by 3° to 4°F. The author recommends showers in place of wallows for organized dairies. [K. C. S.] George D. Quigley & Earnest N. Cory. The utility of D. D. T. for the control of poultry ectoparasites. Poultry Sci. Sept. 1946, Vol. XXV, No. 5, 419-423. WHEN 50 mg. of D. D. T. was fed mixed with all mash ration even up to 120 days, no toxic effects were evidenced but apparent elimination of body lice took place after 10 weeks. Eggs from treated birds were not toxic to experimental rats upon feeding, but when the same amount of D.D.T. was given by mount in capsules toxic effects were noticed after 20 days, suggesting the cumulative nature of the drug. Massive doses of D.D.T. though toxic in effects, did not prove lethal. At 20 per cent and one per cent levels D.D.T. in pyrophyllite when dusted on half the egg towards the larger end or one per cent. D. D. T. in triton-xylol emulsion when applied to the egg, did not reduce hatchability. When applied to individual birds at 2 per cent and 10 per cent levels in pyrophyllite by salt shaker method, D.D.T. gave protection for 30 days but 48 hours had to elapse before the birds were free of the lice. Dusting of layers upon the roosts twice at least two weeks apart at 20 per cent, level in pyrophy- llite was effective to control both body and shaft lice. This method had no adverse effect on egg production. Insects and bed bugs were easily destroyed by D.D.T. and in case such dead insects are consumed in large quantities by fowls the authors are of opinion that no harm will ensue. [S. G. I.]
267 [Vol. XVIII, Part IV REVIEW Veterinary Helminthology and Entomology By. H. O. MONNIG (Published by Bailliere Tindall and Cox, 7 and 8, Henrietta Street, London, 3rd Edition pp. XVIII+427, 31s. 6d.) ZOOLOGISTS in general and parasitologists in particular will doubtless hail the appearance of the third edition of Monnig's book which is very handy work of reference for students of veteri- nary helminthology and entomology. The first print of this book appeared only 13 years ago and the rapidity with which the third edition had to be brought out is a clear indication of its utility and popu- larity. The book has been written in an easy style and the general get-up is excellent. The third edition is marked out by the additional drawings of some helminth ova and gravid segments of common tapeworms of domestic animals. Some figures in the previous editions have been replaced by the author's own drawings. The information contained in Section I forms a very useful intro- duction to the understanding of most of the implications of veterinary parasitology. Section II is devoted to technique, the knowledge of which is indispensable to a student of parasitilogy. Refer- ences have been made to the anthelmintics such as hexachlorethane and phenothiazine and insec- ticides such as D.D.T. and Gammexane which have been successfully used in recent years. A fairly exhaustive note has been added on phenothiazine. In a short compass of the book of this size it is not expected that all helminth and arthropod parasites so far recorded from domestic animals should have received attention but the important ones have been dealt with. It is, however, felt that re- ference should have been made to parasites such as Paryphostomum sufrartyfex, Pseudodiscus collinsi, Varestrongylus pneumonicus, Capillaria bilobata, Hæmonchus similis and Leiperacanthus gallinarum. Parafilaria bovicola and Protostrongylus rufescens do occur in India also. The name and date [Bhalerao, 1942] have been bracketted against Cymbiforma indica, which is evidently an error. Mention should have been made of Tobacco-lime dressing against warble-fly larvæ. G. D. B.

K. LALL, B.Sc., M.R.C.V.S., Assistant Animal Husbandry Commissioner with the Government of India and V. R. RAJAGOPALAN, Dip. Bact. (Vict.) Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar-Kumaon (Received for publication on 4 November 1948) (With plates I to III) A PECULIAR form of dermatitis was noticed among the lambs at the Govern- ment Livestock Farm, Hissar, and, at one time, it caused some concern as mortality among the affected ones was rather high. The disease was observed in 1942 among a few lambs but it attracted particular attention when it assumed serious proportion in 1944. The disease at first, occurred in one of the blocks of the farm and spread to another one, about four miles away, in about two weeks. Clinical features The outbreaks occurred in the rainy months of July, August and September and higher incidence was recorded, in pens which were damp, being in low lying areas. The Hissardale2 ACTINOMYCOTIC DERAMATITIS IN CROSS MERINO LAMBS [Vol. XIX, Part I, it took a long time, for the skin to assume normality and the wool remained dis- coloured for quite sometime. Some of the scabs took longer to fall off and with the new wool growing under them, they looked like an odd crop of mushrooms (Plate II, fig. 2). The crop of wool after recovery was got analyzed, as regards crimp, length, elasticity and tensile strength and was found to be normal. It, therefore, appears, there is no permanent damage to the wool follicles. There was no itching in the initial stages, but in later stages some animals were seen scratching and responded to the scratch reflex. The course varied from four to fifteen days. The appetite was maintained in those cases in which there was no rigidity of the neck. There was a rise of tempera- ture of one or two degrees in fatal cases, usually on alternate days. PATHOLOGY Post-mortem lesions The skin was hard, congested, and about ten times thicker than the normal. In some cases there were small depressions at the surface of the skin and in others nodular eruptions, but in the majority of cases, however, the skin was like a sheet of parchment. The cut surface, showed the presence of minute pustules (Plate II, fig. 1). The blood vessels of the skin were extremely congested. No lesions, directly referable to the main disease, were detected in any of the internal organs. HISTOPATHOLOGY The lesions are referable to a local infectious disease of the skin with the seat of the germ in the epidermis. There is an inflammatory change of the cutis at the epithelial margin, leading to rapid proliferation of the cells of the germinal layer with cornification or parakeratosis and hyperplasia of the prickle cells (Plate III, figs. 1 and 2). The cells of the parakeratotic transitional layer preserve their nuclei which are flattened and in section appear lentil-shaped. The cells of the superficial layers are devoid of nuclei and stain poorly and uniformly. These parakeratotic cells, on account of the pressure of the cornified tissue from above and the strong degree of resistance of the wavy papillary body from below, are thrown into ridges and taps and look under low power as a series of pillars composed of arched cells. There are focal accumulations of polymorphonuclear leucocytes, usually at the base of the arches at their junction with the prickle cells. The blood vessels of the dermis are congested and those of the papillæ are laden with a large number of leucocytes. In some cases the wool folicles are fewer in number. The sebaceous glands are compressed and are not easily distinguishable in grossly affected places. The collogen fibres of the hypodermis are very thick and numerous as compared with the normal and the blood vessels are congested and contain many polymorphs. The causal organism is rod-shaped with infrequent branching. In sections they appear of varying thickness. By gram weight they are Gram positive and appear to stain uniformly but under higher power, most of these rods comprise of rules of biscuit-shaped discs. These discs apparently stain more intensely along the

The organisms are distributed in largest numbers at or near the surface of the skin. They work their way up along shaft of the wool follicles and sometimes reach as far down as the papillæ of the hair. They are also found working into the epidermis in tortuous courses along the poles of the sweat glands. Sometimes fragments are found dis- tributed throughout the cornified tissues but they never apparently reach the prickle cells or the dermis. The peculiar distribution of the parasite suggests that they are normally present on the surface of the skin and in the hot rainy months when there is a large outpour of sweat, the stratum cornium becomes soft and affords the parasite a suitable site for its growth and multiplication and the infection probably extends along the sweat pores but the inflammatory changes induced at the stratum germinativum and the attraction of leucocytes through the intercellular lymph spaces of the prickle cells is a distant action possibly effected through the agency of a diffusible toxin. BACTERIOLOGY The causal organism which was clearly a mycelium in morphology, could not be cultivated as the lesions, in each case, had been previously treated with preparations containing iodine. Detailed work on the bacteriology of the organism from other outbreaks is under investigation and will be published on completion of the work in. due course. DISCUSSION From the available literature it appears, that this condition has not been previ- ously recorded in India. Seddon [1927-28] described a form of disease very similar to what we observed except that in our cases the matting of the wool was not a prominent feature. Bull [1922] isolated a mycelium from such cases which he named Actinomyces dermatonmus. Morais [1922] described apparently the same disease under the term 'Lumpy wool' and he associated the disease with an excess of mois- ture owing to continued rainfall. Cases also were marked by 'Lumpy wool'. Morais [1930] was unable to transmit the disease by contact or by scarification, but Fethers [1939] was readily able to transmit the disease. Among those who have described similar diseases in other species is Albiston [1933] who reported the disease in calves. The organism isolated conformed to the general description of A. dermatonomus except that colonies of his cultures were greyish-white in contrast to the yellow colour typical of the type species. Stable- forth [1937] and Edgar and Keast [1940] encountered similar conditions in the horse caused by the same organism. The lesion started at the lip and spread to other places. The disease has been reported in the goat by Beaton [1932] in which lesions were found in the abdomen and the inner surface of the forelegs and thighs. SUMMARY A form of dermatitis in Hissardale lambs (Bikaneri-Merino crosses) caused by a mvcelium is described along with the symptoms, lesions, and histopathology.

STUDIES ON THE DRYING OF RINDERPEST VIRUS By N. B. DAS, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on 6 August 1948) THIS paper describes experiments on the drying of rinderpest virus so as to conserve its virulence. The undried virus does not retain the virulence for very long in the Indian field conditions unless maintained on ice or otherwise suitably refrigerated. The dried virus, on the other hand, can resist better the environmental factors, chiefly climatic, which are responsible for the rapid deterioration of the undried product. Pfaff [1938] dried goat spleen vaccine in vacuo over calcium chloride and showed that the dried vaccine was equal in its immunizing effect in cattle and buffaloes to the untreated fresh spleen vaccine. Nair et al. [1942] also reported similar results. Robles and Generoso [1934] prepared a vaccine by slow drying of spleen and lymph glands of rinderpest infected animals over calcium chloride in the cold. We have desiccated the virulent virus according to Pfaff as well as by other methods and have also studied the stability of the dried product at such temperature ranges as would be experienced in the transit of dried virus from the laboratory to the field. EXPERIMENTAL The virus contained in leucocytes as well as in spleen tissues has been desiccated by different methods. The dried products were tested on hill bulls (Kumauni cattle) for virulence at varying intervals after preparation to study the survival of the virus under certain methods of drying and when exposed to different tempera- tures for varying periods. Experiments with leucocyte-cream Blood of a hill bull, inoculated with rinderpest virus (E-line of this Institute) was collected in sterile flasks containing sodium oxalate (0.2 per cent final concen- tration). The oxalated blood was centrifuged to separate plasma and the white cells were carefully collected with a pipette. The white cells were freed from the contaminated R. B. C. by repeatedly centrifuging the cell suspension in normal saline. One c.c. of this cream was kept at 4°C as control; 0.1 c.c. of this control sample was tested on a hill bull along with the other samples described below. Drying on filter paper A piece of Whatman filter paper (No. 40; 2 sq. c.m.) was soaked with 1 c.c. of the above leucocyte-cream and was dried in a vacuum desiccator over calcium chloride, the desiccator being in an ice-salt mixture for the first few hours and then at 0°C overnight. The evacuation was repeated a few times during the first five hours in order to maintain a high vacuum. Ultimately the dried material was ground in an agate mortar with 2 c.c. normal saline and the whole suspension was injected subcutaneously into a hill bull (Table I). 5 B
6 STUDIES ON THE DRYING OF RINDERPEST VIRUS [ Vol. XIX, Part I Drying by cold acetone One c.c. of the leucocyte-cream was mixed with 5 c.c. of acetone (cooled in ice- salt mixture for two hours prior to use) in a small test tube and was left in ice-salt mixture for five minutes with occasional shaking. The whole precipitate was then collected on a small filter paper (Whatman No. 40) in the refrigerator. The precipi- tate, along with the filter paper, was dried in a vacuum desiccator over calcium chloride as described above. The dried material was ground with 2 c.c. normal saline and was inoculated into a hill bull (Table I). Drying by cold alcohol One c.c. of the leucocyte-cream was mixed as above with 5 c.c. of cold absolute alcohol and was kept in ice-salt mixture for five minutes before filtration. The residue on the filter paper (Whatman No. 40) was dried as above. The dried material was similarly ground with 2 c.c. normal saline and was injected into a hill bull (Table I). Arrangement of animals, inoculation and recording of temperature, etc. All the experimental animals described here were kept in alternate stalls in disinfected sheds in order to prevent spread of infection from one to the other. Separate syringes were used for injecting different animals and the operator disin- fected his hands after every injection. The control animals, inoculated with un- treated virus, were isolated from the experimental animals by accommodating them in a different shed and their temperature was always taken last of all. The thermo- meters were sterilized by washing first with alcohol and then with carbolic acid solution before recording the temperature of each animal.

March, 1949 ] N. B. DAS 7 From the above Table it appears that the leucocyte-cream virus was not com- pletely destroyed either by drying on filter paper or by precipitation with cold acetone. The delayed reaction in case of alcohol dried virus appears to be due to the changed properties of the virus. The above results prompted us to study if virulent rinderpest spleen virus could be dried without loss of potency ? Experiments with spleen tissue The spleen was collected from hill bulls on the 5th day of inoculation with the E-line virus in a sterile vessel covered with ice and was minced twice in a cool and sterile mincer. The resulting spleen pulp was dried by the methods described below. Drying by cold acetone The spleen pulp was agitated with five volumes of cold acetone (cooled in ice-salt mixture) for three minutes and was filtered over Buchner funnel under suction. The residue was treated again as described above and was finally kept in a sterile beaker in vacuo over calcium chloride in order to get rid of the last traces of moisture, the desiccator, covered with a black cloth, being in ice-salt mixture for two hours and then at 0°C. After 40 hours the dried tissue weighing 1.1 gm. (equivalent to 5 gm. fresh tissue) was emulsified in 15 c.c. sterile broth and was inoculated subcutaneously into a hill bull. The other half of the dried tissue was kept in a sealed tube at room tem- perature and was tested after one month (Table II). Drying by cold acetone and ether The pulp was treated twice as described above with cold acetone and then with twice its volume of cold ether on a Buchner funnel. The tissues which were almost dry were finally kept, as above, over calcium chloride. After 40 hours the dried tissue, equivalent to 5 gm. fresh tissue, was injected into a hill bull as mentioned earlier and the other half was kept at room temperature to be tested after a month's storage (Table II). Drying by cold acetone in the presence of phosphate The pulp was mixed with a solid phosphate mixture yielding pH 7.0 and was treated with ten volumes of cold acetone for five minutes before filtration under suction. The fine dry powder was then kept over calcium chloride as above. After 40 hours the dried tissue, equivalent to 5 gm. fresh tissue, was injected into a hill bull and the other half was stored at room temperature (Table II).

Calcium chloride dried virus is active even after fifteen days storage at 37°C and after four months storage at 4°C. SUMMARY Rinderpest virus contained in leucocytes can be dried by cold acetone as well as on filter paper in vacuo over calcium chloride. Experiments on the drying of rinderpest virus contained in spleen tissue by cold acetone, cold acetone followed by ether, cold acetone in the presence of phosphate as well as in vacuo over calcium chloride are described. Virus dried in vacuo over calcium chloride appears to be the best and is active up to 0.01 gm. dose while virus dried by cold acetone was sometimes found inactive in that dose. Virus dried over calcium chloride has been found potent after at least fifteen days storage at 37°C and four months storage at 4°C. It is not inactivated on storage for seven days at 28°C after being kept at 4°C for four months. Acetone dried virus was found potent after two months storage at 4°C. This work was carried out under the guidance of Mr J. R. Haddow. REFERENCES Nair, K. S., Krishnamurti, R. & Kalyanasundaram, G. S. (1942). Indian J. vet. Sci. 12,305. Pfaff, G. (1938).

SOME EFFECTS OF FEEDING WHITE RATS WITH RATANJOT (ONASMA ECHIODES) IN VAN ASPATI AND ITS PATHOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE. By D. A. MUNRO and J. M. LALL, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 6 July 1948) THE powdered leaves and roots of the plant Onasma echiodes Linn. (ratanjot) are in common use in ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of various affections in the human subject and although much has been learned of the therapeutic use of this drug, little is known of its activity in the body after absorption. It has been suggested that the dye extracted from the roots of the plant would be a suitable agent for colouring vanaspati to distinguish it from ghee when retailed for sale and, in furtherance of this aim, it was considered desirable to test its toxicity on small animals. In studies carried out at this Institute [Pande and others] results have shown the coloured vanaspati to be non-toxic when fed to rabbits, as no symptoms of toxicity developed. It was, however, considered advisable to reinvestigate this problem in order to determine if the same factors had any influence on white rats, and whether the addition of the dye to vanaspati rendered it toxic by its repeated and continuous absorption in the tissues of the body over a prolonged period and if so, whether it was sufficient to produce symptoms of clinical importance. White rats were chosen for this study, as these animals are mostly used for dietetic experi- ments on account of their adaptibility to a variety of diets; besides in feeding habits they approximate most closely to man in subsisting on foods compounded from different sources. In an attempt to use rabbits for our feeding experiments in the early stages of this work it was found that when ratanjot was mixed with vanaspati and added to the diet, the feed was totally refused, or eaten very sparingly. Feeding with the aid of a graduated pipette was then resorted to, but here, there was too much resistance on the part of the animal, and the danger of the food entering the trachea and bronchii was always considered a risk, besides a good deal of wastage occurred making it impossible to estimate accurately the total quantity taken. An appreciation of these facts led us to abandon the use of rabbits, as bad results are likely to follow when food unfit for a particular type of animal is forcibly given. A distaste for the coloured vanaspati or as a matter of fact for vanaspati alone when fed by drenching showed itself by the animal eating very sparingly and often starving itself, thus affording an excellent example of the bad results which follow the abuse of natural laws in connection with dietetics. On the other hand the feeding of rats with coloured vanaspati and vanaspati alone is quite a simple affair, the rats accustom themselves gradually to this diet and no interference with the normal process of digestion is brought about. 11 D
12 SOME EFFECTS OF FEEDING WHITE RATS WITH RATANJOT [Vol. XIX, Part I METHOD Concentrated ratanjot in powdered form was obtained from the Director, Indian Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore. A solution of the dye in vanaspati was prepared by gently heating the mixture repeatedly till as much of it as possible was dissolved. This was filtered through cotton wool and the concentrated dye used to colour the vanaspati to produce colour readings of 5, 12, and 25 red units in a half centimeter cell in the Lovibond tintometer. The experiment was carried out on eight rats and two control rats, all within the 85 to 90 days age limit. The rats were divided into four groups and all were kept on the same stock diet consisting of wheat flour 65 per cent, maize 15 per cent, casein 10 per cent, wheat bran 3 per cent, salt 1 per cent, yeast 5 per cent and calcium carbonate 1 per cent, plus an allowance of milk and green daily. In addition, raw goat liver was given twice weekly. The progress of each animal was watched and each was weighed every ten days. Mea- sured quantities of coloured vanaspati calculated at the rate of 1.25 c.c. per 100 gram body weight was given orally once daily to each rat with the aid of a graduated pipette as follows: Group 1.March, 1949.] D. A. MUNRO AND J. M. LALL 13 coalesing to form a small mass. On microscopic examination Gram negative cocci- form bacilli were seen which confirmed the identity of the disease to that caused by Bacterium pseudotuberculosis rodentium. The most striking feature at post- mortem was that in the livers of rats receiving the coloured vanaspati, the surface was studded with haemorrhagic spots giving it a spotted appearance. These lesions were seen to extend to the parenchyma. Varying degrees of differentiation were observed in the livers of those receiving more of the dye, which also showed a wider range of changes on microscopic examination. Macroscopically, the livers on cross section showed a deeper reddening of the hepatic parenchyma with dilated central and peripheral veins. All other organs were normal. HISTOLOGICAL FINDINGS A histological examination of the tissues of all rats under the experiment was carried out. The organs examined were the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidney, stomach, intestines, and eye. The examination showed very few changes in the tissues examined. Slight changes were found in the spleens of rats receiving larger amounts of the dye which showed congestion and dilatation of the venous sinuses. Patches of broncho-pneumonic lesions were frequently found in some of the lungs indicating a secondary infection, but as these lesions had no relation whatsoever with the experiment itself, they did not merit further consideration. The main changes were in the liver of rats receiving the coloured vanaspati, details of which are given below. Rats in Group 1 A slight widening of the hepatic capillaries with no changes in the liver cells. Rats in Group 2 Hepatic capillaries engorged. Liver cells are seen to disintegrate, fade and gradually disappear, leaving pale areas devoid of liver cells. Rats in Group 3 The hepatic capillaries are more deeply engorged. The liver substance is, congested, although the inflammatory process is not evenly distributed. Here too the liver cells are seen to disintegrate and fade, leaving in some parts of the hepatic tissue pale areas completely devoid of liver cells. DISCUSSION It will be seen from the above that the most important changes are brought about in the liver, following the presence of an irritant in the portal blood. It is an interesting fact that the absorption of the dye after a period of feeding for four months does not cause any special symptoms, although the morbid change affects the liver of the animals in varying degrees. Further, it does appear entirely improbable that the presence of these lesions in the bodies of the rats should be accidental, especially since the gradations of the lesions in the three groups of rats vary in severity with the amount of the dye fed.
14 SOME EFFECTS OF FEEDING WHITE RATS WITH RATANJOT [Vol. XIX, Part I, SUMMARY The feeding of ratanjot dissolved in vanaspati (with a colour reading of 5 red units in a half centimeter cell under Lovibond tintometer and heated to a tempera- ture of 160-170°C) for a period of four months did not reveal any toxic symptoms, but on autopsy hæmorrhagic spots were present under the capsule of the liver which might also be seen in the parenchyma. No changes in the liver cells were observed. In the case of rats of groups 2 and 3, which were fed continually for a period of four months with a higher concentration of the drug having a tintometer reading of 12 and 25 red units, the livers showed definite changes, with severe destruction of liver cells. Ba d on the evidence obtained from feeding rats with ratanjot dissolved in vanaspati with a colour reading of 5 red units, it would appear to be advisable to use a much lower concentration of the dye to tint vegetable fats to avoid the harmful effects on the liver, if it is desired to use this substance as a colouring agent. No abnormal charges were observed in the livers of the control rats. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT We wish to express our thanks to Dr N. D. Kehar for his great interest and assistance in this work.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE OX WARBLE-FLY (HYPODERMA LINEATUM DE VILLERS) AND SOIL MOISTURE IN INDIA By B. N. SONI, B.Sc.(PUNJAB), B.Sc. AGRIC. (EDIN.), Officer-in-Charge (Hides and Skins Schemes), Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar-Kumaun (Received for publication on 5 July 1948) THE outstanding fact in the regional distribution of warble flies is their occurrence- in dry, arid localities and their rarity in, or almost complete absence from, moist areas. Thus, Bishop and his collaborators [1926] working in the States of America, state that warble grubs are not found in cattle in low swampy areas; whilst, according to Smith [1932], they are more numerous in Kansas after a dry spring than after a wet one. Walton [1925], in his account of warble-fly infestation among cattle in Great Britain observes: 'Tabulated records suggest a diminution in the abundance of warble larvae following a cool, rainy spring in the preceding year.' In India, Fletcher and Sen [1930] refer to the infestation being 'as a rule, restricted to North-Western India, and absent from the moist areas, such as Madras, Assam, Burma and Ceylon'. Numerous observations made by the present writer in the course of his warble-fly surveys of different localities in India, point to the same conclusion. Thus, during the winter of 1938 the writer examined 178 heads of cattle of the Dacca Government Cattle Farm in Bengal and none of these showed warble larvae on the back, in spite of the fact that for some previous years warble-infested bulls had been imported into Dacca from Hissar (Punjab). A similar observation was recorded at Trivandrum in South India. Here the writer examined about 20 dairy cows recently imported from Karachi and all showed fully developed H. lineatum larvae in their backs, the infection in these cases having been apparently acquired before importation into Trivandrum; for no tumours were found on local breeds of cattle or on cows previously imported from Karachi. During 1937-38, the writer, in collaboration with Mr S. R. Chadha, carried out a survey of the North-West Frontier Province and the infestation was found to be 'very heavy in the hilly districts.' In places where the land is marshy all along, e.g., in Bannu, the warble- fly is very rare but in the dry sandy areas like Dera Ismail Khan it has been most abundant [Chadha and Soni, 1939]. Likewise, in Rajputana, 5,355 (68.65 per cent) heads of cattle were found infested out of a total of 7,800 examined there by the writer in November 1941, whilst in certain tracts not one animal was found free from the infestation. It is noteworthy that similar observations have also been recorded in the case of the goat warble-fly (H. crossii), for Cross and Patel [1921], *Paper read at the 24th meeting of the Indian Science Congress, held at Banaras in January, 1941. Re-written in the light of the discussion which took palce at the meeting. 15 E
16 THE RELATIONSHIP OF OX WARBLE-FLY AND SOIL MOISTURE [Vol. XIX, Part I, working in the Punjab, observed that the percentage of goats harbouring the larvae of this fly varied from 48.3 in some flocks to 91.8 per cent in others. A very high incidence of warble-fly infestation in goats has also been recorded from the North- West Frontier Province, Sind and Baluchistan. In as much as the adult and the egg-stage periods of H. lineatum are very short and its entire larval life is spent inside the animal's body, atmospheric humidity and temperature can have little influence on these stages of its life-cycle. On the other hand, the pupal period normally lasts for from 4 to 6 weeks and is spent underneath the soil surface. It would, therefore, seem more than probable that one, if not the only, condition that ensures the viability of the fly in its pupal stage is the freedom of the soil from excessive moisture. This is illustrated in the case of the district of Gujranwala in the Punjab, where, inspite of heavy warble infestation in the ad- joining areas, the water-logged condition of the soil in certain localities of this dis- trict has apparently operated against the development of H. lineatum in its pupal stage. A similar example is provided by the marshy tract of tehsil Laki in the district of Bannu, North-West Frontier Province. Support to the foregoing hypo- thesis is also lent by the fact that, whilst varying degrees of infestations have been seen in the hilly districts of Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Nilgiris and Shillong, the pest has been found to be wholly or almost absent from the adjoining plains, this being attributable, inspite of frequently heavy rains in these districts, to the quick loss of the moisture content of the soil due to declivity and gravelly nature of the locali- ties. It is of interest that, at Darjeeling and Kalimpong, the incidence of warble-fly infestation was sometimes as high as 20 to 30 per cent. Bruce [1938], working in the United States of America, has also referred to the influence of soil moisture on pupal development in H. lineatum. He observes, Cattle grubs, Hypoderma bovis De G. and Hypoderma lineatum (De Vill.), are found throughout the United States, but there are certain areas where they are scarce or periodically absent. Most of these areas are small and scattered, but there is one large area, the Red River Valley of the North, where, under average climatic conditions, cattle grubs are entirely absent. To most stockmen of this area cattle grubs are unknown. Quite naturally the question arises, what factor or set of factors is responsible for the scarcity of cattle grubs in this area ? This question was studied by the Bureau of Entomology from 1929 through 1932. Apparently the dominant controlling factor is excessive soil moisture.' Observations made on H. lineatum larvae and pupae kept under known moisture conditions at the Mukteswar laboratory have shown that grubs placed on soil saturat- ed with moisture died without pupating. Out of a dozen pupae left over for 50 days on soil containing 20 per cent moisture and over, not a single emergence took place, and the pupae on dissection showed no trace of adult development. Also no fly emerged from a batch of twelve pupae kept at 15 per cent soil moisture and on dissection only two of the puparia showed partially developed adults. In a batch of six pupae kept at 10 per cent soil moisture, only one emergence took place, the pupal period in this case being 42 days. Pupae kept in containers with soil moisture varying from 1 to 5 per cent yielded the maximum number of emergences,
March, 1949.] B. N. SONI 17 for out of a batch of nine pupae thus treated six fully developed adults emerged, the average pupal period in these cases varying from 14 to 18 days. A constant tem- perature of 22°C. was maintained throughout these experiments. These results are summarized in the following Table I. TABLE I Observations made on H. lineatum larvae and pupae kept at known moisture conditions Percentage of soil moisture Percentage of emergences Pupal period 20 . . . . . . . . . . nil .. 15 . . . . . . . . . . nil .. 10 . . . . . . . . . . 16.6 42 days 1 to 5 . . . . . . . . . . 66.6 14 to 18 days The laboratory observations described above are claimed to demonstrate con- clusively the intimate relationship of soil moisture with the pupal development of H. lineatum and indirectly with the regional distribution of the pest. It is of interest that they are in accord with the results of some field experiments carried out by Bruce [1938] in the United States of America, for these results 'showed that although Hypoderma pupae would not develop in wet soil, the same soils, provided with ample drainage, would permit complete development and adult emergence.' SUMMARY An excess of soil moisture has been found to have detrimental effect on the development of the Hypoderma lineatum in its pupal stage, which normally extends over a period of nearly six weeks. Experiments carried out in the laboratory at Mukteswar have shown that the maximum number of emergences occur at a soil moisture varying from 1 to 5 per cent. No fly emerged from pupae kept at a soil moisture of 15 per cent and above. It is concluded that, it is the moisture content of the soil that accounts for the concentration of the H. lineatum in certain localities and its absence from others. This conclusion is borne out by field observations on the regional distribution of the pest in India and in the United States of America.

THE NUTRITIVE VALUE OF THE INDIGENOUS GRASSES OF ASSAM The aquatic grasses, their chemical composition and nutritive value By S. K. TALAPATRA, and M. N. DEV GOSWAMI, Animal Nutrition Research Scheme, Assam, Gauhati (Received for publication on 14th June 1948.) THE importance of the uncultivated grasses in the economic feeding of our cattle needs no special emphasis. In the eastern provinces of the country where conditions are favourable, they seem to grow in abundance during their season time. Organised attempts have not been made to utilise these grasses as cattle feeds, partly because little is known about their palatability, chemical com- position and nutritive value. However, data on the composition of some of the highland indigenous grasses are available [Sen, 1937] and [Kehar, 1947] but there seems to be no reference in the literature either in regard to the chemical composition or the nutritive value of the aquatic grasses which grow in abundance almost in every part of Assam. In view of the acute shortage of fodder in the country, it has been considered desirable to explore the possibilities of utilising these stuffs as cattle feeds. We have recently completed some detailed investigations as to whether the aquatic grasses can be profitably utilised in the dietary of our cattle as green fodder, hay and silage. The object of the present communication is to give an account of these investiga- tions as follows :20 THE NUTRITIVE VALUE OF THE INDIGENOUS GRASSES OF ASSAM [Vol. XIX, Part I, TABLE I Protein content of the monthly cut samples on dry basis Month Dal grass Uridal grass Khanapara Tongra Panjabari Beltola April . . . . . . . 27.1 28.1 29.4 ..

34 THE NUTRITIVE VALUE OF THE INDIGENOUS GRASSES OF ASSAM [Vel. XIX, Part I, Calcium, phosphorus and nitrogen balances under uridal feeding.March, 1949] S. K. TALAPATRA AND M. N. DEV GOSWAMI 35 Mineral nutrition of cattle following the feeding of the aquatic grasses.30 THE NUTRITIVE VALUE OF THE INDIGENOUS GRASSES OF ASSAM [VOL. XIX, PART I, SUMMARY The aquatic grasses are fairly rich in protein and phosphorus but poor in calcium. Even at the worst stage, they are leafy, soft and succulent and contain protein above the hay level. As green fodders they are not much relished by cattle. When made into hay by the 'Tripod system', considerable green colour is retained and the stuff is very much relished by cattle. Metabolism experiments have shown that the crude fibre digestibility of the grasses is high, which indicates that the fibre is not coarser in ligno-cellulose aggrega- tion. A positive retention of calcium is not assured whether the grasses are fed as green fodder, hay or silage. It has been observed that the aquatic grasses should preferably be utilised in the form of hay, as green feeding leads to considerable worm trouble.

INVESTIGATIONS ON FAMINE RATIONS JAMAN (EUGENIA JAMBOLANA, LAM.) SEED AS A CATTLE FEED BY N. D. KEHAR AND K. SAHAI, Animal Nutrition Section, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 31 July, 1949) INDIA is one of the food deficit countries. The shortage of concentrates is much more acute than that of roughages. According to a recent estimate [Kehar, 1946] the supply of concentrates falls short of the adult bovine requirement by about 62 per cent. This estimate does not take into account the growth require- ments of young stock and production requirements of milch and draught cattle. The magnitude of the shortage appears all the more serious, when the requirements of 48 million sheep, 38 million goats, 4.5 million equines, 1 million camels and 173 million fowls are also taken into consideration. With a veiw to meet this shortage of concentrates Kehar and Chanda [1945] have shown that mango seed kernel, which was largely thrown away as a waste, could be satisfactorily used as a partial substitute for grains and oil cakes in cattle rations, thereby making available 70 million lb. of digestible protein and 760 million lb. of starch equivalent. Likewise, entrails, which are not economically utilized at present, were found by Kehar and Chanda [1947] to be a rich source of protein for cattle and they would make available about 47.4 million lb. of excellent protein material. This article presents observations on the use, as cattle feed, of Jaman seeds, which are found in enormous quantities and are at present thrown away as a waste. Jaman is an evergreen tree met with throughout India and Burma, ascending the hills to about 6,000 feet. It is also known as Blackplum, Jaman- plum, Jambul and Blackberry, etc. EXPERIMENTAL The seeds, collected from the waste heaps or from sweepings under the trees, were washed to remove the adhering sand, dried and analyzed for organic and inor- ganic constituents. The chemical composition of jaman seeds, as also of some common grains, on dry basis is given in Table I. 37 I

The balances for calcium and phosphorus too are positive. The positive retention of important nutrients agrees with the gain in weight and healthy appearance of the experimental animals. The data on the consumption, excretion and digestibility coefficients of the various constituents in the jaman seeds are detailed in the Table VI. The digesti- bility was determined by the method of elimination and the necessary data for the auxiliary feeds, viz., wheat straw and rape cake, was taken from Sen [1938].

The fairly satisfactory digestibility coefficient of the protein, ether extract and total carbohydrates and the biological value of protein give the seed a place in the list of concentrates of proved value. It has not been possible to assess accurately the quantity of jaman seeds avail- able annually, but as one tree yields about two to four maunds or seeds, it is believed that these observations would make available, from a hitherto unutilized source, millions of maunds of protein-rich food for livestock.

AYYAR, Animal Nutrition Section, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar. (Received for publication on 19 March 1948) ALKALI treatment of straws has been the subject of study in the Animal Nutri tion Section for some time past and it has been observed that alkali treatment improves the nutritive value of roughages. Its effect is mainly on the digestibility of fibre. On alkali treatment the liguin binding of the celullose of the roughage is ruptured, thereby facilitating the action of digestive juices on colullose during meta- bolic processes. Sen, Ray and Talapatra [1942] have shown that on alkali treat- ment the total carbohydrate digestibility of wheat and paddy straws increased to a marked extent. In the present work alkali treatment of Sacchurum munja, locally, known as Bhurra grass has been studied. In India, where shortage of fodder for livestock is acute, improvement of straws which are not generally utilized by cattle has a great economic significance. Bhurra grass is a typical example of such a straw. It is a perennial grass with very low palatability. When green it is not very much relished by cattle and when dry it is impossible to feed it as such. It is available in large quantities and is generally used for thatching purposes. In a previous expe- riment conducted in the section [ by Kebar, 1944], it has been shown that animals could not be induced to eat dry bhurra grass except with the addition of molasses and its feeding value, under those conditions of feeding, was found to be 3.8 per cent starch equivalent and 27.78 per cent total digestible nutrients with no digestible protein. Analysis of the bhurra grass has shown that it is fairly comparable with wheat and paddy straws in chemical composition (Table I, next page). The following work was, therefore, undertaken to see whether dry bhurra grass could be improved in its palatability and nutritive values by treating it with caustic soda solution. The results have been found to be quite encouraging. Treatment of Bhurra grass with caustic soda solution The bhurra grass was chopped and soaked in ten times its weight of 1.5 per cent caustic soda solution in a cemented tank of suitable size for 24 hours. It was turned several times during the period of soaking for a uniform treatment of the lot. There- after the residual alkaline liquor was drained off to another tank.

It was then dried in the sun. Fifty per cent more alkali was 47 L

AYYAR 49 added to the mother liquor which was made up to the original volume with water to bring it approximately to the original strength and the reinforced alkaline solution was used for treating another lot of bhurra grass. Twenty-four lb. of caustic soda were used in 1600 lb. of water for treating 160 lb. of bhurra grass. Twelve lb. more of caustic soda were used to reinforce the residual liquor which was made up to the original volume for treating another 160 lb. of bhurra grass. In all, 36 lb. of caustic soda were used for treating 320 lb. of bhurra grass and the yield of alkali treated bhurra grass was 256 lb. There was thus a loss of 20 per cent in the air dry material due to alkali treatment. The effect of alkali treatment on the dry matter of the straw is as shown below.

Per cent dry matter lost. 100 92.07 80 72.39 21.88 The loss in dry matter could be accounted for by the loss sustained by the other constituents except crude fibre. Nitrogen free extract and the total ash are the constituents which contributed most to the loss of dry matter. By the alkali treatment of bhurra grass its various constituents were affected as shown in Table III. The percentage loss or gain of the different constituents are also shown therein. It might be noticed that the percentage of crude protein, ether extract, N-free extract, phosphours, potassium and chlorine was lowered and that of crude fibre, calcium, magnesium and sodium was increased. Crude fibre was apparently not very much affected by the alkali solution as is evident from the percentage loss. The loss in N-free extract has, however, been compensated by the rise in fibre so that the total carbohydrate content of the treated grass is higher than that of the untreated grass. The rise in the calcium content, may to a great extent, be accounted for by the deposition of calcium on the grass from tap water which on later examination contained significant amounts of calcium. The increase in sodium content of the treated straw was obviously due to a certain amount of the alkali having been retained inspite of the repeated washings. Digestibility and nutritive value of treated bhurra grass For carrying out a digestibility trial two country bulls and two Kumaon hill bulls were used. Their live weights were 833 lb., 832 lb., 231 lb. and 236 lb. res- pectively. All the animals were started on a ration containing treated bhurra grass fed ad libitum, a weighed quantity of 'sarson' cake and an ounce of common salt L 2

The animals consumed a fair amount of the treated grass, the average consumption per 100 lb. live weight being approximately 14 lb. It may be observed, that the crude protein and the ether extract of the treated bhurra grass were not digested by the animals, though in the case of animal No. 5 a slight digestibility of ether extract may be noticed. As regards the digestibility coefficients of crude fibre and total carbohydrates they are fairly high, the figures being 84.17 and 71.98 respectively. When the digestibilities of these ingredients are compared between the country bullocks and hill bulls, it appears that the country bullocks digest the crude fibre and the total carbohydrates slightly better than the hill bulls. The nutritive value of alkali treated bhurra grass has been determined by the usual Kellner's method and the results are set out in Table VIII; for the purposes of comparison the nutritive values of alkali treated wheat straw and paddy straw [Sen, Ray and Talpatra 1942] have also been given.

Calculated on the basis of the original untreated straw these values for the remainder come to 23.5 lb. S. E. and 42.6 lb. T. D. N.; compared to the untreated grass these values are much higher. The importance of alkali treatment, thus gains more significance. It improves the grass as regards its palatability and nutritive value to a remarkable extent. The nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus balances under treated bhurra grass feeding have also been studied and the balances (average per day) of intake and out- put of these elements have been worked out and the results are presented in Table IX.

With regard to nitrogen balance, both these sets of animals do not show any difference. The balances of the three elements under treated bhurra grass feeding show that the animals are capable of retaining them in their system.
March, 1949] A. W. ZUBAIRY AND N. K. AYYAR 57 SUMMARY Dry bhurra grass is not eaten by cattle. Alkali treatment makes it palatable. Cattle consume about 1.4 lb. of alkali treated bhurra grass per 100 lb. live weight when it is supplemented with suitable amount of concentrate; and they maintain their live weight and remain in positive nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus balances. The treated grass contains 58.8 per cent of total digestible nutrients and its starch equivalent is 32.4 per cent. In its nutritive value the alkali treated bhurra grass compares well with alkali treated wheat and paddy straws. REFERENCES Kehar, N. D. (1944). Indian J. Vet. Sci., 14, 1, 40-48 INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES OF GENERAL DETERIO- RATION OF CATTLE IN MALABAR AND SOUTH KANARA (MADRAS PRESIDENCY) BY M. S. RAJENDRAN, G.M.V.C., P.G.(Mukt.), P.G.(Anim. Husb.), Lecturer in Animal Husbandry, Madras Veterinary College (A Scheme financed by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, from 1.5.1944 to 31.12.1945) (Received for publication on 8 December 1947) IT is well known that the cattle on the West Coast of the Madras Presidency are small and stunted in growth which is attributed to mineral and vitamin deficiencies, general malnutrition and parasites, etc. An experiment was conducted to determine the relative importance of each factor, at Pattambi in South Malabar District. There, in the West Coast, the annual rainfall ranges from 75 to 150 inches, with an average of 100 inches at Pattambi. The soil is poor and laterite in nature and is known to be deficient in lime and phosphates. There is no distinct breed of cattle in this area, all being non-descript, the average lactation yield of cow being 500 to 700 lb. with a daily average of about 2 lb. and a maximum daily yield of 5 to 6 lb. Stall feeding is not practised as a general rule except in case of a few animals which are fed a little rice gruel and rice straw or in case of milch cattle which get small quantities of concentrates like cotton seed, oil cake and rice bran during their lactation period. METHODS AND MATERIAL Forty-eight bull-calves, about one year old and locally bred, were purchased. These were divided into four representative groups of twelve each, keeping in view their size, height, health and vigour so that all the groups were as similar as possible. These groups were named as A, B, C & D and given a different type of feed and treatment. Each group was separately photographed in the beginning of the experiment and thereafter every six months. Their body weights and measure- ments were kept to see the variation in growth as the result of different feeds and treatments. Group A was the control group and fed rations somewhat similar to that given to the animals of this type normally in this area. 59 N
60 INVESTIGATIONS INTO CAUSES OF GENL. DETERIORATION OF CATTLE [Vol. XIX, Part I, RATION March, 1949] M. S. RAJENDRAN 61 RESULTS Verminosis The greatest trouble that was encountered just before and after the commence- ment of the experiment was the death among the calves at very short intervals, 11 out of a total of 14 deaths had occurred within a period of two months (from the 18th April 1944 to the 19th June 1944). A large majority of the animals that died both before and after the commencement of the experiment showed clinical symptoms and post-mortem appearances of verminous infection and they were the youngest of the whole lot. However, when the animals attained the age of one year and more and when there was marked improvement in their condition under better feeding, care and management, mortality from verminosis stopped. There were but three deaths for the whole of the remaining period of the experiment, i.e., 18½ months, but the clinical symptoms and post-mortem appearances in these three were quite different from those of the previous 11 deaths. In all the above 11 cases, there were typical clinical symptoms of verminosis before death. In seven of them, the worms collected at post-mortem, from the fourth stomach were identified as Mecistocirrus digitatus or Haemonchus contortus; thus detection of strongyle eggs in their dung earlier as evidence of verminosis was confirmed at autopsy. It was noteworthy that not a single worm of Ascaris species was found and not a single specimen of dung was found to contain eggs of Ascaris species even though specimens of dung from each animal were examined regularly throughout the period. The response shown by the. animals suffering from parasitism, particularly with strongylosis, is worthy of attention. It was, however, not possible to save many of these diseased animals from death since in all these, the parasitic infection was so advanced as to cause exhaustion, lowered vitality, anaemia, etc. Every animal that was treated for strongyles with copper sulphate and that died subse- quently within a few days of treatment, had no worms at all in the fourth stomach; in a few cases when the period between the treatment and death was short, post- mortem examination revealed either dead or disintegrated worms in the fourth stomach (in one case they were found just at the commencement of the duodenum); whereas in every case that was not treated, numerous worms were discovered in the fourth stomach during autopsy and they were identified as Mecistocirrus digitatus or Haemonchus contortus. Four of the seven animals that died after the actual commencement of the experiment on 1 May 1944. died carly during the experimental period, i.e., from about the fourth to sixth week. Except in one in which there were a good number of Haemonchus contortus (this was an untreated case in Group A), no worms were encountered at the time of the post-mortem examination in the other three. The deaths in these cases are considered to be due to the after-effects of strongyle infection coupled with the poor anaemic and exhausted condition of these animals at the beginning of the experiment. That parasitism is particularly harmful in the early age of an animal is again proved by these findings; in addition, it has to be stressed that treatment, to be effective against parasitism, must be undertaken in the early stages of the animals' life, i.e., before it is a year old.

62 INVESTIGATIONS INTO CAUSES OF GENL. DETERIORATION OF CATTLE [Vol. XIX, Part I, In all the groups except the first which was left untreated as a control, treatment for worms was repeated every three weeks for the first two months and afterwards every two months. For the first four months, only one per cent solution of copper sulphate in doses of 100 c.c. was given and was found to be effective in the removal of stomach worms. Later on, copper sulphate in combination with nicotine sulphate was given in the following increasing doses, the interval between treatments being two months.

Three animals in this group died during the course of the experiment, one due to Haemonchosis. In another the clinical symptoms and post-mortem appearances were indicative of parasitic gastritis and the dung taken before death and at post- mortem examination revealed eggs of strongyles but no worms were found. Death in the 3rd case was due to mechanical bronchitis. From the general appearances of the animals. the post-mortem findings, as well as from the statement of daily weights recorded, it may be observed that the animals in this group were not any more backward than those in Group B, although the latter group was subjected to periodical deworming. Group B This group differed from Group A in that the animals in it were dewormed periodically, while in the previous one they were not treated at all.

DETERIORATION OF CATTLE [Vol. XIX, Part I, In this group, two animals died showing clinical symptoms and post-mortem appearances of strongyle infection. The deaths can be attributed to the after- effects of parasitism and so treatment could not save these animals. To add to it, there were the factors of lack of pasture and malnutrition to reckon. Group C This group differed from Group B in that it was given, in addition, graded doses of a mineral mixture and common salt as shown before.

DETERIORATION OF CATTLE [Vol. XIX, Part I, W=L×G2 /.300 when W is the live weight in pounds, L is the length of the animal from the point of shoulder to the point of the buttocks in inches, G is the heart-girth of the animal in inches. The weights calculated from the measurements (length and girth) and actual live weights recorded during a month were averaged. The coefficient of correlation between the actual and calculated weights were worked out monthwise. The values of coefficients show that the correlation is fairly high, especially so, as the age of the calves advanced. It would, therefore, appear that for all practical purposes the live weight of the animals, when no weighing machine is available, may be calculated by this formula. SUMMARY The cattle of the West Coast of the Madras Presidency (Malabar and South Kanara) are small and stunted in growth and cows are poor milkers. This article deals with a nutritional experiment conducted to study the cause or causes of small and structed growth of cattle and their poor milk-yield in Pattambi (Malabar), where the rainfall is heavy and the soil is laterite in nature and known to be deficient in calcium and phosphorous. The experiment was conducted with four groups of one year old locally bred bull calves. A. B. C and D. each group consisting of 12 animals. Group A (the control group) was fed on rice conjee, paddy straw and a little common salt. Group B received the same ration as above but was dewormed periodically. Group C received the some treatment as Group B but was given, in addition, graded doses of mineral mixture and salt. Group D was fed on a balanced ration consisting of cotton seed, groundnut cake, rice bran, mineral mixture, shark liver oil and salt and was also dewormed periodically. The animals were kept under observation and fed on these rations for a period of 20 months. The greatest trouble encountered was death among young calves below or nearly one year of age due to strongylosis. Treatment with copper sulphate alone or in combination with nicotine sulphate was found to be effective. The animals in Group A were not any more backward than those in Group B although the latter were periodically dewormed showing perhaps, that with advanced age, resistance to the bad effects of helminthic infection also increases. Rice gruel in quantities given in combination with paddy straw was inadequate for growing calves. Better results were obtained when the same ration was supple- mented with green grass. The rate of growth of the animals became less and less as the age advanced.
March, 1949] M. B. RAJENDRAN 67 The feeding of large doses of mineral mixture and salt did not significantly improve the condition of the animals and it is not known whether the inadequate ration or the lack of vitamins A and B or both were responsible for this. Better results were obtained when an improved balanced ration was given as for Group D. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS It is my pleasant duty to express my gratitude to Mr. T. J. Hurley.

TEMPERATURE CORRECTIONS FOR THE LACTOMETER READING OF THE MILK OF INDIAN COWS AND BUFFALOES By ZAL, R. KOTHAVALLA, C. P. ANANTAKRISHNAN, AND T. M. PAUL, Indian Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 31 March 1947) (With one text figure) IN the routine testing of milk, the determination of the lactometer reading is an essential preliminary test. Seasonal and individual variations in the composition of milk are large, but the herd milk has a comparatively small range in that respect. It is, therefore, not easy to adulterate milk with water to any considerable extent and at the same time keep it within the standard lactometer reading. The simplicity of the test, the cheapness of the equipment required, and the narrow range within which the values fall for genuine milk, render the test quite useful in determining the genuineness of milk. Ordinarily, to determine the correct specific gravity, the temperature of the milk sample is raised or lowered, as the case may be, to 60ºF., before the correct lactometer reading can be taken. This adjustment of temperature is all the more necessary if the sample is below 50ºF. or above 70°F. Within this narrow range of 50° to 70°F. fairly accurate values for specific gravity, can be obtained by taking the lactometer reading at the temperature of observation of the sample and then applying the correction factor from the Tables prepared by either Vieth [1885] or Richmond [1899]. These Tables are widely used for finding out the specific gravity of milk at 60°F. from the lactometer reading taken at some other temperature. The total solids may then be calculated from the specific gravity and also the precentage of fat in the milk. The temperature corrections in these Tables, however, range only from 40 to 75°F. and from 40 to 80°F. respectively. The British Standards Institution [1937] has published a correction Table, but even this extends only upto 86.0ºF. Hence their use is rather limited in a tropical country like India, where the maximum temperature is seldom below 80°F. for the major part of the year. Wright [1913] extended Vieth's Table with a view to make it applicable to lacto- meter readings taken between 40ºF. and 80ºF. Hutchinson [1940] extended Richmond's Table to 90°F. But even these extended Tables do not meet the require- ments of countries like India. It is difficult to cool milk samples to 60°F. for specific gravity determinations when the room temperature is 100°F. or above, as it is, in certain seasons. Facilities for cooling milk are seldom available in rural areas. It has, therefore, become necessary to resort to the method of taking the lactometer reading at whatever temperature the milk is received and then applying a correction for the difference in temperatures. The conditions under which this kind of test is required to be carried out demand that the correction Table should be so wide as to cover the range of temperatures usually met with in the tropics. 69 P
70 TEMPERATURE CORRECTIONS FOR THE LACTOMETER [Vol. XIX, Part I, This paper, therefore, deals with the results of investigations carried out to achieve the above object, as also with a study of the effect of fat content and varia- tion in temperature on the specific gravity of milk. It is a well known fact that a rise in temperature decreases the specific gravity of a milk sample and a fall in temperature increases its specific gravity. Secondly, solids not fat increase the specific gravity, whereas the fat decreases it. Vieth and others have studied the variation of specific gravity mainly with reference to temperature only. Perhaps they have assumed either that fat and solids not fat in milk are almost the same universally or that they vary only within a very narrow range as in the Western coun- tries. In India, however, cow milk shows a wide variation in fat percentage (usually from 3 to 6 per cent), and in buffalo milk a fat percentage as high as 8 per cent is not very uncommon. This makes the study of the problem all the more complicated. EXPERIMENTAL Effect of fat and temperature on the correction of lactometer reading Samples of milk were taken from the dairy herd at the Institute, at 4-30 A.M. and kept under refrigeration at 40ºF. till 8-30 A.M. to avoid Recknagel phenomenon. Fat percentage was determined by the Gerber method. The milk samples were then toned to various lower fat percentages with separated milk which usually contained less than 0.1 per cent of fat. Separated cow milk was used for toning cow milk and buffalo milk for buffalo milk. Generally 200 ml. of the toned milk were taken in a 250 ml. conical flask. After cooling or warming it to the desired temperature it was mixed thoroughly by slow rotation, taking care that no air bubbles were incorporated due to violent shaking. The milk was then poured into a 250 ml. measuring cylinder, the lactometer dipped upto its entire scale length and then left free. When the lactometer came to rest the reading was taken at the top of the meniscus, an addition of 0.2 being made to the reading to make up for the error due to meniscus. Simultaneously with the noting of the lactometer reading the temperature also was noted with a Fahrenheit thermometer. Of the lactometers available in the laboratory, Gerber's thermolacto-densimeter, graduated from 20 to 40 with a sensitivity of 0.5 and having an attached thermo- meter ranging from 0º to 40ºC., was the only one found to record the same specific gravity as determined by a specific gravity bottle or pyknometer. Another advant- age of this lactometer was that its scale divisions were well apart. As, however, the attached thermometer was graduated in degrees C. and as it took considerable time to record the temperature when it was rising or falling, a separate Fahrenheit thermometer was used for noting the temperature of the milk. Having taken the lactometer reading at 50°F. the temperature of the milk sample was gradually raised to 60ºF. by pouring the milk back into the conical flask and heating it on a water bath. Again the lactometer reading was taken as before. These readings were repeated at intervals of 10ºF., from 50ºF. to 110°F. Whenever the temperature had to be brought down it was done by cooling the sample in ice. After finishing one reading the measuring cylinder and the lactometer were washed and drained completely before another reading was made.
March, 1949] ZAL, R. KOTHAVALLA, C. P. ANANTA KRISHNAN AND T. M. PAUL 71 Four dozens of samples each of cow and buffalo milk were studied as described above. Both types of milk are considered together in this paper. The mean of the results of the variations in the specific gravity with fat and temperature obtained, is given below in Table I. All these results were tabulated and the difference in the lactometer reading from that at 60°F. was calculated for every temperature of observation. These differences in lactometer readings always exceeded the correc- tion factors given by Richmond. TABLE I Fat per cent Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit Difference of lactometer reading from that at 60ºF. Fat per cent Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit Difference of lactometer reading from that at 60°F. 50 72 TEMPERATURE CORRECTION FOR THE LACTOMETER [Vol. XIX, Part I, fixed from 50ºF. to 110ºF. The fat percentage was fixed at 3 as the minimum, since no genuine milk sample is ordinarily below this figure in India. The higher limit of fat was fixed at 8 as ordinarily the fat percentage does not exceed this. Preparation of the Correction Table One hundred and seventy-five samples covering a range of 3.0 to 8.5 per cent fat were studied. These included approximately equal numbers of both cow and buffalo milk samples. The temperature range adopted was 50°F. to 110°F. with readings at intervals of 10°F. The difference in lactometer reading at each tem- perature interval from the lactometer reading at 60°F. was thus experimentally obtained for each fat percentage. These results were all grouped according to the fat percentage and the mean of all the values was taken in each case as the average difference of lactometer reading from the lactometer reading at 60°F. at the particular temperature and for that particular fat percentage. These mean differences for each fat percentage at 50°, 70º, 80º, 90º, 100º, and 110ºF. were plotted and presented in Fig. 1. This graph was utilized for preparing Table II for correcting the lactometer reading taken at any temperature between 50ºF. and 110ºF. for milk samples with fat percentage ranging from 3 to 8.

ANANTAKRISHNAN AND T. M. PAUL 75 Lactometer readings were also taken with each increase of 5ºF. temperature, and the difference of the lactometer reading from that at 60ºF. was then plotted against the temperature. The points were found to be on the same curve as with an interval of 10°F. Cow and buffalo milks of the same fat percentage were studied and were found to behave similarly with regard to the change of lactometer reading with a rise in temperature. Further, cow and buffalo milks were mixed in various proportions and the change in lactometer reading in relation to temperature studied, There again the samples were found to behave quite normally with regard to the correction factors. Milk samples having various acidities ranging from 0.11 to 0.20 per cent lactic acid were also studied in a similar way. It was found that acidity had no effect on the lactometer readings and their corrections. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Fig. 1. VERIFICATION OF THE CORRECTION TABLE The Correction Table was verified with cow and buffalo milk-samples selected at random. The correct lactometer reading at 60ºF., one reading between 50ºF. and 60ºF., and 2 or 3 readings at temperatures between 60ºF. and 110ºF. were taken for each sample. The actual difference between the lactometer readings at 60ºF. and other temperatures were thus determined and compared with the readings
76 TEMPERATURE CORRECTIONS FOR THE LACTOMETER [Vol. XIX, Part I, from the table for the correction of lactometer readings. Over 400 readings were thus experimentally obtained from samples taken at random including cow and buffalo milks and covering the entire range of fat percentages of the table prepared. The summary of the results of this verification showed that 17.0 per cent of the results agreed with corrections found in the prepared table, 22.0 per cent differed by ±0.1; 19.5 per cent differed by ±0.2; 15.0 per cent by ±0.3; 7.0 per cent by ±0.4 ; 9.0 per cent by ±0.5; and only 10.5 per cent exceeded a difference of ±0.5. On the whole, 90.0 per cent of the samples tested agreed within an error of ±0.5. Since Richmond's Table extends only up to 80°F. and since he has not mentioned the fat percentage of the milk, the correction factors obtained by Table II can not be strictly compared with Richmond's. However, for milk with 3 per cent fat, the correction factor obtained by our table was found to be much higher than that obtained by Richmond's Table. Since ordinary lactometers are graduated only in whole numbers indicating only the third place decimal of the specific gravity (0.001), an error of one degree in the lactometer reading may be permitted without much serious inaccuracy in the specific gravity. If such an error is permissible, all the values taken for verifying the new table agree with the Correction Table worked out. Sixty-five readings obtained from the milk of two Ayrshire cows and 150 readings from the milk of half-breed cows were also found to agree with the new table prepared and now recommended as a result of this investigation. HOW TO USE THE NEW TABLE (ZAL-KRISHNAN TABLE) FOR THE CORRECTION OF LACTOMETER READING To obtain the correct lactometer reading at 60°F. of any milk sample at any temperature between 50ºF. and 110ºF., the milk need not be heated or cooled. If the sample is to be examined directly after milking, sufficient time (at least 2 hours) should be allowed, or proper precautions taken to see that the Recknagel phenomenon has ceased. The sample should then be stirred well and the fat percentage of a representative sample determined. The milk should then be poured into a suitable container (preferably a glass container), which should permit free floating of the Gerber's thermolacto-densimeter, without touching either the bottom or the sides. Usually one quarter of a pound of milk will suffice for this purpose, if a cylindrical vessel of suitable diameter is available. The lactometer should then be immersed to the full length of the graduated scale and set free so that it freely moves up and down. When it comes to rest the reading should be noted without any error due to parallax. Simultaneously with the noting of the lactometer reading, the temperature of the sample should also be noted with a good Fahrenheit thermo- meter. The correction factor should then be read out from the table against the observed temperature and fat percentage, and added or subtracted from the observed reading according to the observed temperature being above or below 60°F. In applying the correction factors the fat percentage may be corrected to the nearest whole number and the correction factor read out from the respective column.

SEM EN STUDIES AND ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION IN POULTRY By D. P. MUKHERJEE and P. BHATTACHARYA, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for Publication on 17 July 1948) (With plate IV and one text figure) ARTIFICIAL insemination in poultry was first attempted by Ivanoff [1913]. Since his pioneer work various techniques for collection of semen from cocks and for inseminating the hens have been tried by several workers abroad. However, artificial insemination in poultry has not assumed the same importance that it has in large farm animals. The reasons are that most of the Western countries have already reached a very high and uniform standard of excellence in poultry and production costs in poultry are nomimal as compared to those in large farm animals. Furthermore, there is no great scarcity of high quality cocks for breeding purposes. Also fertile pedigree eggs can be had easily. The life-cycle in these animals is very short and huge flocks can be developed in about a couple of years. In India the conditions are different. Poultry husbandry is yet in its infancy. The size of birds is small and their performances poor. Good birds are rare. By the introduction of artificial insemination, a large number of hens can be bred from a few outstanding cocks. Also, it will remove the difficulty of physical incompa- tibility encountered in mating small sized hens with large sized cocks. To carry out a successful programme of breed improvement by grading and other breeding practices information regarding the characteristics of cock semen is needed. The present experiment was undertaken to determine the characteristics of semen of desi cocks and exotic birds (White Leghorns) reared in India. MATERIAL The experimental material consisted of three one year old White Leghorns, an equal number of desi birds of the same age, and 13 laying hens. Of the 13 hens six were White Leghorns and the remaining Rhode Island Reds. The birds were obtained from the poultry farm, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar. The hens were housed in a shed 14 fit, 3 in. × 11 ft. opening on one side into a run 18 ft. 6 in. × 14 ft. The cocks were kept confined in separate cages 1 ft. 7½ in. × 1 ft. 4½ in. × 2 ft 5 in. throughout the experimental period, except at the time of semen collection. Care was taken that each cock received sufficient sunlight. The birds were kept on a balanced ration throughout the experimental period. METHOD Collection of semen from cocks and insemination of hens were made according to the method of Burrows and Quinn [1935]. The semen is collected by massaging the soft part of the abdomen below the pelvic bones of a cock as shown in Plate IV. fig. 1 and for inseminating the oviductal opening of the hen is first exposed by 79 R
80 SEMEN STUDIES AND ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION IN POULTRY [Vol. XIX, Part I, exerting digital pressure on the abdomen and the semen is deposited in the oviduct as shown in Plate I, fig. 3. Semen samples were collected from each cock every Monday and Thursday. The Monday collection was used for the study of semen characteristics and the other sample was used for insemination. Twentyfive samples from each cock were studied for the following characteristics (i) colour and consistency, (ii) volume, (iii) pH, (iv) initial motility of spermatozoa, (v) sperm concentration per c.c., (vi) total number of spermatozoa and (vii) percentage of abnormal spermatozoa. Colour, consistency, volume and motility were observed immediately after collection. Volume was measured to the nearest 1/100 c.c. and the degree of motility was scored in terms of criterian recommended by Erb, Andrews and Hilton [1942]. pH was determined by B.D.H. Capillator within 10 minutes after collection. Sperm density was determined by the haemacytometer method in terms of millions per c.c. [Macirone and Walton, 1938]. To determine the percentage of abnormal sper- matozoa the following methods of fixation and staining were adopted. A very thin film of semen was made by adding a drop of semen to normal physiological saline solution on a clean slide. The film was then fixed in the vapour of 2 per cent osmic acid for about 10 to 15 minutes and stained with 0.1 per cent methylviolet for 15 to 20 minutes. One hundred spermatozoa were examined at random with the aid of an oil immersion lens and abnormal spermatozoa were noted. The semi-diagramatic camera lucida drawings of normal and various abnormal spermatozoa found during the course of the experiment are given in Fig. 1.

BHATTACHARYA 81 Each hen was inseminated once a week with 0.3 c.c. of diluted semen (1 part of semen and 2 parts of Ringer's solution) by depositing it into the exposed orifice of oviduct with the help of a micropipette (Plate I, fig. 3). RESULTS Table I shows the various physical characteristics of semen produced by the cocks. It will be seen from this Table that in desi birds colour and consistency of semen varied from very thin milky to thick milky whereas in White Leghorns variations were from milky to very thick milky. The mean volume in desi birds varied from 0.182 ±0.011 to 0.335±0.018 and in White Leghorns from 0.304±0.012 to 0.43±0.026. The mean pH in desi birds varied from 6.6±0.05 to 6.8±0.03 and in White Leghorns 6.4±0.46 to 6.8±0.13. The most common initial motility of spermotozoa of the two breeds was +++++. The mean sperm concentration in desi birds ranged from 1635±253 to 3287±240 and in White Leghorns from 2891± 347 to 3852±185 millions per c.c. The mean total number of spermatozoa in desi varied from 491±77 to 1012±104, and in White Leghorns from 1191±92 to 1266±199 millions. The mean percentage of abnormal spermatozoa in desi birds varied from 3.2±0.172 to 4.08±0.288 whereas in White Leghorns from 3.68± 0.31 to 3.8±0.29. On the whole the quality of semen of White Leghorns as judged by colour and consistency, volume, sperm concentration and the total number of spermatozoa, was superior to that of the desi. The data of the various attributes of semen of the two breeds have been statisti- cally analyzed and the results are presented in Table II. It will be seen from this Table that highly significant variations were found in volume and the total number of spermatozoa per collection in the two breeds. Significant variation had been noticed in the sperm concentration of the two breeds. There was, however, no significant variation in pH, initial motility and the percentage of abnormal spermatozoa. Fertilizing quality of the semen produced by the experimental cocks is shown in Table III. This Table also shows the plan of artificial breeding. This plan was followed throughout the experiment with a view to minimise the effect of breed difference in hens, if any, on fertility. The percentage of fertility in birds inseminated with semen of desi cocks was 82.21 and in those inseminated with White Leghorn semen 88.73. DISCUSSION The volume of semen obtained per collection in this study was comparatively smaller than that reported by Lambert and Mackenzie [1940], but it was similar to that obtained by Martinaz [1939]. It may be mentioned here that considerable variation exists in the amount of semen produced by different cocks and even in the same bird at different times, Hutt [1929]. It would be necessary to undertake an extensive study to determine definitely, whether the volume of semen produced by cocks in India was really smaller than the birds reported by Lambert and Macken- zie [1940], pH and sperm concentration of semen were within their respective ranges R 2

Burrows and Quinn [1937] obtained 90 per cent fertility in fowls by inseminating one hen per week with 0.1 c.c. of good quality semen. Jeffrey [1941] reported 82 per cent fertility in hens by inseminating once a week with the same amount. It seems, therefore, that percentage of fertility may vary from 82 to 90 per cent in fowls by one insemination a week with 0.1 c.c. of good quality of semen. The percentage of fertility obtained for individual birds as well as for the two breeds were almost the same as reported by the above mentioned workers. The difference in percentages of fertility as found in desi and White Leghorn cocks may not be due to the difference in the semen quality of the two breeds. SUMMARY Various characteristics of semen of White Leghorns and desi birds have been studied. Significant variation was found in volume, total number of spermatozoa and concentration of spermatozoa in the two breedsABSTRACTS COCCIDIOSIS OF POULTRY. ' SULPHA' DRUGS OFFER NEW HOPE OF CONTROL Fischel, W.G. (1946). Newzealand J. Agri. 73, (6), 515-517 THE author has found Sulphamezathine to be very useful for the treatment and control of every type of coccidia affecting the poultry. Both forms of administration, i.e., in drinking water and with the feed are equally effective but the former appears to be less wasteful and ensures the intake even if the appetite is impaired by the inflammatory condition of the intestines characteristic of coc- cidiosis. Saturated solution of the drug is, for example, prepared by dissolving 0.5 gm. (or 8 grains) in hot water by constant stirring. For four-day treatment of hundred chicks of varying ages the proportionate requirement of the drug and water is as follows: Age 1-2 weeks . . . . . . 10 gm. in 2½ gallons 88 ABSTRACTS [Vol. XIX, Part I, membrane of the develop g chick. The authors demonstrated the presence of the agent after ten serial egg passages. No pathological change of the membrane was noticed during the course of such passages. Attempts to demonstrate the agent microscopically and culturally failed. In view of the above findings it was considered that the infection was due to a virus. (C.S.) THE AMOUNT OF DDT FOUND IN THE MILK OF COWS FOLL- OWING SPRAYING Howell, D. E., Cave, H. W., Heller, V. G. and Gross, W. G. (1947) J. Dairy Sci. 30, 717 IN this article the authors have recorded their observations on the amount and toxicity of DDT found in the milk of cows following the recommended and excessive spraying with the drug for the period beginning from July 15 to August 30. Four equal lots, each comprising of two Jerseys and two Holstein dairy cows, were employed in the experiment. The first lot was sprayed daily with 2 quarts of 5 per cent water suspensible DDT spray per animal and the second with a similar quantity of 5 per cent emulsion for the first four days and 1 per cent for the subse- quent period of the experiment to prevent tissue damage. The third and the last lots were sprayed individually on the same day every other week, the former with 2 quarts of 0.25 per cent water suspensible powder and the latter with 2 quarts of 0.25 per cent emulsion. In addition to these animals one single cow was sprayed and sampled daily with 2 quarts of 5 per cent water suspensible DDT from August 10 to August 30, to provide more comprehensive data of the elimination of DDT through the milk. It was found that milk samples collected from the experimental cows three and ten days after spraying contained no DDT; but all samples collected on the seventeenth day after spraying was started were positive for qualitative tests. The amount of DDT found in the milk as a result of quantitative tests ranged from slight traces to 33.6 parts per million. The milk of Jerseys generally contained more DDT than those of Holsteins. It was concluded that all animals tested ex- creted some DDT in the milk and those sprayed with excessive amounts continued to eliminate DDT until the end of their lactation period, 119 and 126 days after the last spraying but none after freshening. Biological tests to determine the toxi- city of the milk conducted on mice, mosquito larvae and flies proved to be negative. (T.A.) A TECHNIQUE FOR THE ISOLATION OF COAGULASE-PRODUC- ING STAPHYLOCOCCI FROM MILK IN BOVINE MASTITIS Delia M. Velilla, Faber, M. S. J. E., Jr., Ph. D., and Pelczar, M. J., Jr., Ph.

Res. 8, 275 THE authors have made a comparative study of Difco phenol red, mannitol, salt agar (PRMS), dehydrated (experimental); and Difco Staphylococcus Medium 110 (SM 110), dehydrated (experimental) in isolating pathogenic strains of Staphy- lococci from milk, taking mainly coagulase-production as the criterion of patho- genicity. Composition of the media is described. Plating was done by spreading
March, 1949] ABSTRACTS 89 0.1 c.c. of milk, previously shaken, on the medium surface by means of a sterile, bent glass rod. The inoculated plates of PRMS and SM 110 were incubated at 37ºC for 36 and 48 hours respectively, and colonies were picked up on the basis of fer- mentation in the former and pigmentation in the latter. To determine the coagulase activity various methods using fresh, citrated, pooled rabbit blood and plasma were employed. Slide-clumping test was done according to the technique of Cadness- Graves et al, and for tube coagulase tests the techniques described by Chapman and Chapman et al, were adopted. Observations have also been made regarding haemolytic activity on rabbit blood-agar plates. It has been shown by facts and figures that SM 110 is more efficient than PRMS, although none of the two is perfect. Of all the coagulase tests the slide-clumping test was found to be simple, reliable and quick. Lyophilized blood and plasma proved to be almost as good as fresh blood and plasma on repeating some of the observations with the former. It is further shown that coagulase production does not show complete correlation with either haemolysis or pigment formation on SM 110. All the non-pigmented strains, how- ever, proved to be negative for haemolysis and coagulase production. The procedure recommended for the maximum recovery of coagulase producing Stphylcocci from milk includes the use of both the media with a final confirmation by slide-clumping test. (G.S.) THE OPTIMUM STRUCTURE OF BREEDING FLOCKS. I. RATE OF GENETIC IMPROVEMENT UNDER DIFFERENT BREEDING PLANS Dempster, E.R. and Lerner, I.M., (1947). Genetics. 32, 555-66 THE authors have studied the rates of gain in the production index of birds of various age distribution under three different breeding plans. They have stressed that the efficiency of the breeder's operations depends on three factors: (a) the intensity of selection, (b) the accuracy of selection, and (c) the average interval between generations. In the plan designated as III, the first selection is made on two-year old hens, on the basis of the full records of themselves and their sisters. A year later, the second selection from the group thus chosen is made on the basis of their part progeny records. Finally, a third selection is made on the basis of the full records of the progeny at four years of age. In plans I and II, the above pro- cedure is advanced by a year. Under both these plans, the first selection is made on the basis of individual and family records of birds which have been in production for about four months. In plan I, the pullets rejected are not further considered. The second and third selections are similar to that under plan III except that they occur one year earlier. In plan II, the pullets rejected on the basis of their part records are considered at two years of age when they and their sisters hay completed records. As regards males, the first selection is made at one year of age, on the basis of the part records of sisters. At two years of age, the second selection from these males is based on the full records of the sisters as well as the part progeny records. The authors have shown that greater efficiency is obtained under plans I and II than the schemes under plan III. The use of breeding plans involving a high per- centage of pullets, not only leads to more rapid improvement but also result in a T
90 ABSTRACTS [Vol. XIX, Part I, considerable saving in the cost of breeding operations. In addition to the economic savings due to curtailment of trapping operations, certain reproductive economics have also been realized. It is well known that pullets have a higher reproductive rate as regards egg production, fertility and hatchability, and as such a greater number of chicks per breeding bird is obtained, thus permitting higher selection intensity. (S.B.) NEW INSECTICIDES FOR CHICKEN LICE CONTROL Telford, H.S., J. Eco. Entom. (1945.) (5) 38, 573-576 IN order to meet the urgent need for suitable substitutes for rotenone and pyre- thrum, two very efficient and safe lousicides so far then known, which were in short supply during war time, efforts were made to develop effective insecti- cides for the control of lice on poultry and cattle. Out of 37 compounds tested on 149 chickens infested with lice belonging to the species Eomenacanthus stramineus (body louse), Menopon gallinae (shaft louse) and Goniocotes hologater (fluff louse), DDT 0.5 to 4 per cent, derris (with 5 per cent rotenone) 10 per cent and mixtures containing sulphur and the teramethyl thiouram salts exhibited demonstrable residual effect and relatively quick action. Sodium fluoride 33 per cent, kryocide (cryolite) 0 per cent and micronised wettable sulphur were highly effective but slow to act. The duration of effectiveness of three promising preparations was determined by placing treated hens, freed of lice, in an infested flock. Six birds dusted with 4 per cent DDT had louse infestations approaching their original populations within 30-34 days. Micronised wettable sulphur gave longer protection but 33 per cent sodium flouride was less lasting. Thanite 5 per cent and lethane B-71, phenothioxine, NH dust and O-nitrodiphenyl each at least were relatively quick acting but de- monstrated no residual properties. Unsatisfactory results were given by 15 per cent sodium fluoride, 0.5 per cent necotine (Black leaf 155), 0.25 and 0.125 per cent DDT, 30 per cent genicide (Xanthone), 5 per cent 2,4-dinitro-O-cyclohexyl phenol, 10 per cent sabadilla, 2 per cent 2,4-dinitro-anisole, a mixture of 2 per cent dinitro- anisole and 2 per cent IN-930, 10 per cent orthphenylphenate and a mixture of 2 per cent di-phenyl and 5 per cent velsicol AR-50. A proprietary louse powder containing 0.066 per cent pyrethrins, 30 per cent sulphur, 5 per cent naphthalene, 0.45 per cent petroleum hydrocarbons and 64.48 per cent inert ingredients was found to have quick action and good residual effect when undiluted, but unsatisfactory at dilutions of 50 or 25 per cent in pyrax. (P.B.M.) THE NUMBERS OF DAUGHTERS NECESSARY FOR PROGENY TESTS IN THE FOWL Muller, C. D. and Hutt, F. B. (1946). Poultry Science (25), 246-55 THE report deals with respect to ability to live (viability) and egg production of offspring, in an attempt to determine ways of spotting out superior cocks and hens at early ages and in larger numbers. The breeding season was of 10 weeks' duration and from the first three hatches of the season sufficient number of daughters was usually obtained. When 50 daughters per sire are wanted one should put
March, 1949] ABSTRACTS 91 15 to 18 females in each breeding pen. Any sires already proven superior by pre- vious progeny tests are recommended to be used continuously through the breeding season, in order to produce the maximum number of superior birds. In regard to breeding for viability in the fowl the authors endorse the old saying that the sire is more than half the flock, further males are more easily progeny-tested than females. When the mortality in the flock ranged from 37 to 53 per cent in the test period, the records of 86 sires each of which had 50 daughters or more, on analysis, revealed that about 30 daughters were enough for testing the ability of a sire's progeny to live. More daughters were, however, found necessary in the case of the population with lower mortality. Familial differences in resistance to a specific disease (avian leucosis complex) were obvious when it killed 12.6 per cent of the population or more, but not when it killed only 8 per cent. As the numbers of daughters raised from single dams in one season are too small for differentiation of families the authors conclude that tests of dams are less reliable than those of sires. On the other hand the number of daughters necessary for egg laying trials is much less than that required for tests in regard to viability. Six daughters with completed records appeared adequate for tests of dams for ability to transmit egg laying qualities. (S.G.I.) THE EFFECT OF COBALT ON GROWTH AND CERTAIN BLOOD CONSTITUENTS OF SHEEP Pope, A. L, Phillips, P. H. and Bohstedt, G. B. (1947). J. Ani. Sci. 6. (3) IN 1944, the problem of low wool and lamb productions arose in Northern Wis- cousin. In the begining it was considered to be a parasite problem complicated by anaemia and a decrease of vitamins A and C in blood plasma. The symptoms were weakness, emaciation, lowering of vitamins A and C and haemoglobin contents. An internal parasitic infection was also noticed. The soil was sandy hence liable to mineral deficiency; it was decided to find out effects of mineral trace elements mixed with salt. The authors divided the experimental animals (sheep) in two groups which were similar in general condition and body weight. Group I was fed on a ration consisting of iodine, manganese, copper and iron. Group II was given cobalt sul- phate in addition to the ration fed to animals of group I. Sheep of group I developed symptoms similar to those noticed in the dying sheep in the country around, while the sheep of group II showed an increase in weight and haemoglobin content. Later on, cobalt sulphate was added to the ration of group I and it was noticed that the sheep regained their appetite and commenced feeding within three days. After four weeks of feeding they showed an increase in weight, in haemoglobin con- tent and in the concentration of vitamins A and C in the blood plasma. (K.C.) CONTENT AND DIGESTIBILITY OF MORNING AND EVENING CUTTINGS OF ALFALFA Adolph, William H., Macdonald, H. A., Auilan Yeh and Lofgreen G. P.,August 1947. J. Ani. Sci. 3, 6 IN 1944, Curtis reported that alfalfa plots cut in the evening yield 19 per cent more of total dry matter than those cut in the morning. He suggested that there would be a distinct advantage in cutting all the forage crops in the after-noon rather
92 ABSTRACTS [Vol. XIX, Part I, than in the morning. Further more he felt that the greater part of increase in the dry matter content in the day time was in the easily digestible materials so that there should be a gain in the feeding value much more than that shown by the increase in dry matter. However it was considered desirable to know if feeding tests with animals would show an increase in nutritive value. The present experiment was conducted to compare the digestibility of morning and evening cuttings of alfalfa hay. For this study a field of alfalfa in the early flowering stage was selected and the plots were statistically treated. In the above experiment no significant difference in yield was found between the morning and evening cuts, but a significant curing loss was found in the evening cuts. A metabolism experiment with rabbits showed no significant difference between the digestibility of morning and evening cuts of alfalfa. Oven dried samples of alfalfa showed higher digestibility of carbohydrates, but lower digestibility of protein than the field cured hay. (K.G.)

ORIGINAL ARTICLES LIFE-HISTORY OF COTYLOPHORON COTYLOPHORUM, A TREMATODE PARASITE FROM THE RUMEN OF CATTLE, GOAT AND SHEEP By BIPIN BEHARI SINHA, D.Sc., Research Assistant, Helminthiasis Scheme, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (From the Department of Zoology, Lucknow University, Lucknow) (Received for publication on 22 July 1949) (With eleven text-figures) THE earliest account on the life-history of Cotylophoron cotylophorum is by Krull [1934] who made many interesting observations, but did not give the exact developmental stages. Bennett [1936] thoroughly worked out the life-history of the parasite in America and has, besides, given experimental data in support of it. Srivastava [1938] in India also worked out its life-history and gave a brief account of the developmental stages obtained by him. His paper does not contain any details of the morphology and behaviour at different stages in the life cycle. Under a scheme of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, the author has made extensive studies on the life-history of this parasite and the following results are being published to show the course of development of the parasite as it occurs at Lucknow. METHODS AND MATERIALS Mature worms were collected from the rumen of cattle, goat and sheep from the slaughter houses at Lucknow, and induced to lay eggs in the laboratory by placing them in water in a dish and then surrounding the whole by a water jacket at 70º-80ºF. Cultures of eggs thus laid were prepared, care being taken to remove as much of the animal matter as possible from the eggs, thereby minimizing the development of bacterial infusions in the cultures. The cultures were always prepared in distilled water and the water was changed twice daily. The eggs laid by the worms after removal from the host were studied alive. Miracidia, sporocysts, rediae, cercariae and metacercariae were also studied alive in toto mounts. The miracidia were studied alive unstained, but some were stained intra vitam in either Brilliant Cresyl-blue or neutral red, both of which gave good results. They were killed and fixed in hot acetic sublimate solution, when they maintained almost their natural shape and size. Acetic acid, alum carmine and Ehrlich's acid haematoxylin gave good results for the whole mounts. Sporocysts, rediae and cercariae were taken out of the snails by dissection. Some infected snails were kept in water in beakers and the emerging cercariae collected for further observation and experimental work. All these stages were studied alive, stained and unstained. 1 A
2 LIFE-HISTORY OF COTYLOPHORON COTYLOPHORUM [Vol. XX, Part 1, [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 1. Cotylophoron cotylophorumMarch, 1950] BIPIN BEHARI SINHA 3 THE EGG The eggs (Figs. 1 to 3) are ovoid in shape being slightly attenuated at one end. The egg shell is of uniform thickness throughout, except at the end opposite the operculum, where it is slightly thickened in the form of a small projection which is generally asymmetrical in position. The egg shell is semi-transparent and the ovum can be almost clearly seen through it under the microscope. The eggs are small and measure 0.123-0.134 mm. by 0.067-0.069 mm. in size. Although majority of the eggs laid do not show cleavage, a few were observed to possess two blastomeres at the time of laying. The time required for the eggs to hatch at the laboratory temperature varies greatly. Ordinarily it takes 7 to 9 days in summer and 15 to 16 days in winter. MIRACIDIUM The process of hatching is complicated and observations on the fully developed miracidia inside the eggs, were made to study the process. In a fully embryonated egg (Fig. 4), it was found that a plug-like structure intervened between the operculum and the miracidium. The miracidium was observed to strike against this plug with its anterior end. The plug was gradually destroyed and the miracidium became free to exert its pressure against the operculum. It forces the operculum in a very short time and squeezes out its body through the aperture, which is slightly smaller than the diameter of the body. A miracidium on hatching is extremely active and swims in straight lines with great speed. The body in its forward movement also rotates on its long axis in an anti-clock-wise direction. Each miracidium (Fig. 5) is pyriform in shape, the greatest breadth being a little behind the anterior end. Anteriorly the body tapers sharply to the apical papilla, while posteriorly it decreases gradually in size to terminate at the rounded caudal end. It measures 0.16-0.185 mm. in length and 0.06-0.68 mm. in the greatest breadth. The breadth in our forms is almost one and a half times greater than that given by Srivastava. The entire body with the exception of the apical papilla, is covered over with ciliated plates. These epidermal plates are 20 in number and are arranged in four rows (Fig. 6). The anterior row contains six, the second eight, the third four and the last only two plates. The number and arrangement of these plates have never been found to vary. The nuclei of the plates are large and irregularly branched. In the anterior three rows, the nuclei are situated near the posterior margins of the plates while in the last row are more towards the anterior border of the plates. (Figs 5.) There is a sub-epithelial layer beneath the plates whose nuclei are large, oval to rounded in shape. A fully developed miracidium contains a flask-shaped primitive gut; two pairs of penetration glands4 LIFE-HISTORY OF COTYLOPHORON COTYLOPHORUM [Vol. XX, Part 1, [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 4. Cotylophoron cotylophorumMarch, 1950] BIPIN BEHARI SINHA 5 second rows of the epidermal plates, a small papillar outgrowth is projecting out. Bennett classified it as sense organ. The flame cells are situated a little in front of the middle of the body and their ducts extend posteriorly as two loose coils to open laterally between the third and the fourth rows of the epidermal plates at the excretory pores. INTERMEDIATE HOST Limnaea, Gyraulus, Indoplanorbis and Melanoides were selected for infection experiments, care having been taken to ensure that the snails were free from previous infections. Both individual and mass infection experiments were attempted and as a result it was found that Indoplanorbis exustus was the only snail that attracted the miracidia. Subsequently all the developmental stages were recovered from this snail and thus it was definitely established to be the natural intermediate host of the parasite. No developmental stages were recovered from any other species of the snails used. Two days after penetration of the snail, the miracidium changes into a sporocyst (Fig. 7) which, to begin with, is more or less rounded in shape and the germ ball in many cases had started breaking up and on the third day of infection it was found to contain four to seven developing rediae inside. The mature sporocyst is an elongated sac with the two ends bluntly rounded, and with a central cavity filled with parenchymatous cells. It also bears a pair of flame cells with their ducts on either side of the body. REDIAE It takes 10 to 12 days for the rediae to become fully developed and they are found free inside the body of the snail. The developing rediae are found in various stages of development within the sporocysts (Fig. 7). The germ balls enlarge and assume an elongated oval shape. At one end it becomes rounded and the rudiments of the pharynx are formed while the other end remains broadly rounded. A fully developed redia (Fig. 8) is sausage-shaped and measures 0.56-0.62 mm. in length and 0.13-0.15 mm. in the greatest breadth. It possesses a mouth, a muscular pharynx and a primitive sac-like gut which does not extend beyond 1/3 of the body length from the anterior end. The excretory pore is situated near the middle of the body and there are three pairs of flame cells. The anterior pair of flame cells lies on either side of the gut, while the second pair is laterally in front of the hinder end. The third pair is situated at the middle of the body. The ducts of the anterior and posterior pairs join together near the pore and open by a common duct, while the ducts of the middle pair open into the duct of the anterior pair before it meets the posterior duct. The flame cell formula here is 2 (2+1). The common duct before opening to the exterior, swells to form a small vesicle. The germinal epithelium is situated at the posterior end and the birth pore on the ventral side a little behind the pharynx. The rediae do not possess any lateral

A fully developed redia was observed to contain 10 to 17 developing cercariae inside. No case of a daughter rediae inside the parent was observed. CERCARIAE The snails generally begin shedding fully developed cercariae on the 30th day of infection. They are quite active when shed and swim in water by lashing movements of their tail. It is not easy to take the measurements in the living condition but when the movements are properly restricted, it was found to be 0.456-0.472 mm. in length and 0.141-0.149 mm. in greatest breadth (Fig. 9). They are, however, 0.319-0.43 mm. in length and 0.269-0.298 mm. in breadth in fixed condition. The tail varies from 0.46-0.51 mm. in the fixed condition and 0.61-0.67 mm. in the living condition, so that it appears that cercaria is extremely contractile. The entire body of the cercaria, particularly the anterior third, is thickly pigmented and does not easily permit the study of the internal structures in the living condition. A pair of conical eye spots, however, are easily observed situated immediately behind the oral sucker, with their apices directed antero-posteriorly and the bases mounted with a clear refractile lens. The body is covered over with a thick cuticle while underneath it rows of cystogenous cells are easily seen. The oral sucker is oval in shape and is situated terminally at the anterior end. The acetabulum is oval, being broader than long and is situated at the posterior end of the body. The oesophagus runs posteriorly and bifurcates behind the eye spots into two intestinal caeca. Caeca are small in diameter and terminate a little in front of the (ventral sucker) acetabulum. The reproductive organs are represented by two groups of cells, connected by a single cord of cells. One group of these cells is situated just in front of the acetabulum while the other just behind bifurcation. The posterior mass represents the ovary and the testes, while the anterior one, the genital pore and genital sucker, the cord representing the uterus and vas deferens. The excretory system consists of an excretory bladder, situated dorsally over the acetabulum and the posterior reproductive mass of cells. A small duct running dorso-anteriorly from it opens at the excretory pore while two large excretory ducts meet it laterally. The large lateral ducts were seen to run from the bladder outward towards the anterior end. Near the middle of the body they loop inward, and again pass forward and outward up to the oral sucker. Here again the ducts make a loop behind the eye spots, between it and the oesophagus and then turn outward and backward to run down to the sides of the acetabulum. At the middle of the body, the lateral ducts give out inwards one branch each which run inward and meet each other. From this junction a small duct is sent forward as a median diverticulum. On account of the heavy pigmentation of the body and the presence of cystogenous cells, the flame cell pattern could not be studied. The main ducts, the cross connections and the median diverticulum, are all filled with refractile excretory granules. The tail possesses a central excretory duct which joins the bladder posteriorly. The central duct runs down towards the tip of the tail and a little in front of it swells up into a small vesicle. Two small ducts arise from this and run latero-posteriorly to reach the surface.

In the process of encystment, the cercariae stop swimming and sink down. The body keeps on contracting and elongating while the tail is kept beating violently.. Simultaneously cystogenous cells are thrown out of the body and collect round it. The tail now breaks off and the separated tail continues to beat for a considerably long time afterwards. The completed cyst (Fig. 10) is flat on the ventral side and rounded above. The dorsal surface is dome-shaped. The cyst is almost transparent and the encysted cercariae are seen to retain the pigmentation. The oral sucker, acetabulum, alimentary canal and the excretory ducts are clearly seen even under low magnification. INFESTATION EXPERIMENTS IN FINAL HOST In order to feed the metacercariae to the final host it was thought advisable to induce them to encyst on grass blades which were placed in the beakers containing snails shedding cercariae. The grass blades were then fed to the kids. No record of the metacercariae fed to the kids was kept but the experimental feeding was maintained for five weeks. Two months after feeding one of the kids showed signs of diarrh10 LIFE-HISTORY OF COTYLOPHORON COTYLOPHORUM [Vol. XX, Part 1, TABLE 1 Observations March, 1950] BIPIN BEHARI SINHA 11 REFERENCES Bennett, H.

THE EFFICACY OF TINCTURE OF TOBACCO IN THE TREAT- MENT OF MANGE IN RABBITS* By PARAMJIT R. PABRAI, K. VENKATACHALAM14 EFFICACY OF TINCTURE OF TOBACCO [Vol. XX, Part 1, for 30 minutes after which an ointment of 2 parts of sulphur, 1 of potassium car- bonate and 8 of lard may be applied every day till the fifth day when the soap is again applied and the treatment continued until every rabbit is either cured or destroyed. Schwartz and Shook [1928] advocate a similar treatment with slight modifications. Tobacco is said to possess antiseptic properties when used locally and agriculturists have been effectively spraying a watery infusion of tobacco to destroy vegetable pests. In this laboratory we made an attempt to see if tobacco will be of use in the treatment of this condition in rabbits. A 1 in 10 tincture of tobacco leaves in methylated spirit was prepared and painted on the affected areas twice a week in 17 suffering rabbits. Scabs were taken for microscopical examination after scraping with the dull edge of a knife until blood appeared. The smear examination, after clearing with 5 per cent NaOH, under microscope showed the presence of both the type of mites, Sarcoptes scabiei cuniculi and Notoedres minor cuniculi. OBSERVATIONS Observation of the rabbits treated next morning after application revealed signs of disintegration of the crusts and less of itching. On the second day, the crusts showed falling off from all the. lesions and the animals showed an improvement in their general outlook. They were more active and took interest in their food. On the third day healthier skin was visible at places where crust had fallen off. A smear examination of skin scrapings at this stage showed the presence of mites in fewer numbers. The observations being encouraging after the very first application, it was thought desirable to give another application on the lesions on the fourth day. The improvement was much quicker on the fifth, sixth and seventh days and by the end of the week nearly all the crusts had fallen down and there were signs of hair growth. One more application was given and about 50 per cent of the rabbits completely recovered with almost normal growth of hairs (Plate I, fig. 2) and resumed their normal life. The examination of skin scrapings under the microscope showed complete absence of mites in most of the rabbits and presence of a few in some. Rabbits which were not cured after the third application required one or two more applications for complete recovery. During the course of treatment, the surroundings were disinfected with lysol lotion and cleaned daily in order to remove the dead or dying mites which had fallen off with the crusts from the suffering rabbits. As a control, four affected rabbits, diagnosed microscopically to be suffering from the same disease, were painted with plain methylated spirit. No change in the condition of the lesions was observed proving that some active principles in tobacco are responsible for the parasiticidal action of tobacco when dissolved in methylated spirit and not the latter alone. A watery infusion of tobacco (1 in 10) was also tried on another four suffering rabbits. A course of 10 to 12 applications even was not sufficient to give complete recovery; only a part of the scabs could fall off during this period. This shows

OJHA 15 that the alcoholic extract is much more potent as compared to the aqueous one possibly due to a higher solubility of the parasiticidal principle in tobacco in spirit than in water. Moreover, an alcoholic extract of the drug can be preserved indefinitely. All the seventeen rabbits without exception proved amenable to this treatment and local applications did not produce any toxic symptoms except signs of mild irritation for not more than a minute after the application is made possibly due to irritation caused by diffusion of some spirit into the eyes and the nasal mucous membrane. SUMMARY A 1 in 10 alcoholic tincture of tobacco has been found to be useful in the treatment of Sarcoptic and Notoedric mange in rabbits. Complete cure is effected within 2 to 3 weeks depending upon the degree of infec- tion. The drug has been found to be harmless to the skin when applied locally. The drug may be useful in the treatment of alopecic conditions due to parasitic infections in man. It is under trial.

SOME OBSERVATIONS ON INVESTIGATION OF JOHNE'S DISEASE IN MYSORE STATE By K. RANGANATHA RAO, Veterinary Research Officer, Mysore State (Received for publication on 8 November 1946) THE prevelance of Johne's disease in India was first reported by Sheather in 1917. The reports of the Disease Investigation Officers from the different provinces have lately confirmed that the disease also occurs in many parts of India. In Mysore its occurrence was first noticed in the year 1927. An intensive investiga- tion was undertaken under a scheme subsidized by the Indian (then Imperial) Council of Agricultural Research with effect from July 1935, with a view to studying the incidence and pathology of the disease and to find out the curative effect of oleum chaulmoogra. EXPERIMENTAL HERD In the beginning, a batch of clinically suspected cases comprising three cows and one bullock taken over from a dairy farm constituted the experimental herd on which the preliminary studies were started. Later, positive and suspicious cases which were either received free of cost or purchased for a nominal cost were added to the herd. In addition, groups of animals of varying ages and breeds free from the disease were also added to the herd for the purpose of studying the course of the disease under artificial infection. During the period of study a total number of 788 animals comprising 202 cattle, 31 sheep, 56 goats and 499 small laboratory animals were used. The breeds of cattle represented were (1) Amritmahal (2) Sindl i (3) Gir (4) Kangyam and (5) Cross bred. Naturally advanced cases of the disease were encountered in both sexes in all these breeds of cattle. Epizootology With a view to ascertaining the extent to which the disease existed among cattle in the two cities of Bangalore and Mysore, an epizootological survey was undertaken. For this purpose, each city was divided into blocks on the same lines as the Municipal divisions and with the help of the Municipal authorities, a house to house inspection of cattle was conducted. In Bangalore, out of the total number of 6,512 cattle inspected 2,975 were cows and heifers and the rest were buffaloes. Of the cows and heifers four per cent were declared strongly suspicious for Johne's disease. Similarly in Mysore 1.5 per cent were found suspicious. The source of most of these suspicious cases could invariably be traced to farms known to harbour the disease. Further, conditions under which cattle were housed in the cities were anything but satisfactory. Illventilated, undrained and insanitary byres were largely in evidence. D 17
18 OBSERVATIONS ON JOHNE'S DISEASE IN MYSORE [Vol. XX, Part 1, The existence of Johne's disease, in three big dairy farms which are run on modern scientific lines, was established as a result of a detailed study on the clinical material collected. Evidence was available to show that Johne's disease occurred also among the indigenous cattle in the interior of the State. This was confirmed, when during July 1939 a cow belonging to a Government Cattle Breeding Station, where cattle of Mysore breeds are reared, showed symptoms, suggestive of Johne's disease; it reacted to Johnin positively and later was confirmed by a detailed post-mortem examination to be a typical case of Johne's disease. The corrugations of the intestinal mucosa often described characteristic were not present but bacilli in large clumps could easily be demonstrated in smears. Johne's disease, among sheep was also encountered in the course of the investiga- tions. On two occasions sheep maintained on farms, where Johne's disease among cattle had been known to exist were reported to suffer from diarrhoea and wasting, detailed post-mortem examination and subsequent cultural tests undertaken on these cases revealed that two out of six suspected cases died of Johne's disease. The cultural and microscopical characteristics of causal organism recovered in pure cul- tures from both these cases were in no way different from the organism generally recovered from cattle. Appreciable growth was obtained after three to four weeks of incubation. In view of the fact, that a separate sheep strain of Johne's bacillus, which, is comparatively more difficult to grow than cattle strain has been described by several workers, it would appear more probable, that the sheep mentioned above had contracted the disease from the cattle. Result of artificial infection Repeated attempts were made to infect artificially different species of animals other than cattle, with infective material collected from positive cases of Johne's disease. Sheep, goats, rabbits and guineapigs were employed during these studies. Sheep Out of 15 sheep employed for the purpose 9 were infected per os 4 intravenously and 2 intraperitoneally. All these 15 sheep either died or were destroyed at the end of periods varying from 10 months to 2½ years. The results of detailed examination showed that five out of nine infected per os, two out of four infected intravenously and none out of two infected intraperitoneally harboured the infection. Goats Out of the 56 goats comprising 35 infected intravenously and 21 infected per os it was found that only 13, all belonging to the former lot, had picked up the infection. The material employed for infecting sheep and goats consisted of an emulsion of mesenteric lymph glands freshly collected from a positive case that died of Johne's' disease. The dose was 5 c.c.
March, 1950] K. RANGANATHA RAO 19 Rabbits and guineapigs They were injected intraperitoneally with a paraffin oil emulsion of Johne's bacillus according to the method described by Mohler [1933]. The infective material consisted of an emulsion of culture of Johne's bacilli in paraffin oil. As indicated by Mohler, the proportion of the infective material to paraffin oil was 1:2. The dose employed was 2 c.c. injected intraperitoneally. It was observed that both with regard to the mortality and the type of lesions produced, the results obtained were similar to those described by Mohler. Eighty per cent of the infected animals died at the end of periods varying from seven days to one month. Whereas, the controls that received either plain paraffin oil or a saline or a saline emulsion of Johne's bacillus, all remained healthy. It would, however, be difficult to conclude from these findings that Johne's disease, as we generally understand it, has been reproduced in these animals especially because it is pointed out by some workers, firstly, that such infected rabbits and guineapigs do not usually succumb unless the dose of bacilli is a large one and secondly, that nearly the same type of lesions are obtained by the intraperitoneal injection with even saprophytic acid-fast bacilli or killed tubercule bacilli suspended in paraffin oil. So much so, it is suggested that the lesions are more reaction products than the result of bacterial activity. DIAGNOSIS The diagnosis of fairly advanced cases was comparatively simple. The persistant characteristic diarrhoea which may be intermittant and the progressive wasting of musculature, particularly of the hind quarters, were prominent symptoms. Out of 29 cases which were confirmed as positive, post-mortem smears from rectal mucosa had revealed the bacilli only in nine cases, whereas, the smears of dung were positive in 28 cases. The dung smears for examination were prepared by emulsify- ing dung in normal saline and allowing it to stand for ten minutes when it would separate into three layers, the top layer of lighter pieces of straw, etc. the middle fluid layer and the bottom layer of sediment. A drop from the intermediate fluid layer was spread on the slide, dried, fixed and stained in the usual manner for Johne's bacillus. The results of allergic test were studied on a lot of 34 animals which were all examined post-mortem. Correlating the post-mortem result with the allergic tests it was seen that out of 22 reactors to avain tuberculin, eight, i.e. 36 per cent were found positive post-mortem whereas, out of 17 reactors to Johnin 11, i.e. 65 per cent were found positive post-mortem. Again out of 12 non-reactors to avain tuberculin only eight, i.e. 67 per cent were found negative post-mortem whereas out of 17 non- reactors to Johnin 16, i.e. 94 per cent were negative post-mortem. Further out of 12 animals which were confirmed positive for Johne's disease post-mortem, eight had reacted positively to both Johnin and avian tuberculin and three had reacted to Johnin only and one was a non-reactor to both. Thus, it is observed that Johnin was more specific and reliable than avian tuberculin in spotting both positive and negative cases of Johne's disease in these experiments vide Appendix I. About five weeks old cultures of M. paratiberculosis grown on the synthetic medium were employed for the preparation of Johnin. The Lister Institute strain D 2
20 OBSERVATIONS ON JOHNE'S DISEASE IN MYSORE [Vol. XX, Part 1, of the bacillus which was well adopted to grow on an artificial medium was used for this purpose. The synthetic medium described by Henley [1929] and employed by Dunkin [1931] was employed for the purpose. At the end of five weeks of in- cubation a luxuriant surface growth with pellicle formation was obtained. In the commencement, the whole culture was evaporated to one-tenth of its original volume for purposes of concentration and then filtered but later the cultures were first filtered through paper and the filtrate evaporated on water bath to one-tenth of its original volume. This constituted the Johnin employed for the double intradermal test. The test was conducted in the same manner as tuberculin test, with this difference that the dose of Johnin was 0.2 c.c. at each injection instead of 0.1 c.c. generally used in the case of tuberculin. The increase of thickening of fold of skin obtained in positive cases varied from 6 mm. to even 21 mm. Results of extensive field tests undertaken by the Director of Veterinary Services, Assam, using Johnin supplied from Mysore also confirm these findings. According to the first report, out of 262 cattle tested by him 86 were positive and bowel washings from 54 among these showed Johne's bacillus. Results of detailed post-mortem examinations undertaken on positive naturally infected cases of Johne's disease showed that the so called corrugations of intestinal mucosa were not a constant feature. In a number of animals there was absence of corrugations of the mucosa but smears taken from them contained bacilli in clumps. In such cases, however, the intestinal wall was thickened and the mucous membrane looked coarse and granular. In one instance even this thickening was absent but the smears were positive for organisms. An unusual finding was recorded in one instance where there was evidence of necrosis in mesenteric lymph glands as well as intestines. The smears showed acid-alcohol-fast organisms and tuberculosis was raled out by guineapig inoculations. The following is the summary of the gross pathology recorded from 29 cases : Extensive corrugations 10 Patchy corrugations 3 Corrugations entirely absent 15 Necrotic change present 1 29 TREATMENT Several attempts have been made in the past to treat cases of Johne's disease. Drugs such as ferrous sulphate, sulphuric acid and formalin have been found to check the diarrhoea but not to cure the disease. Williams [1928] in America, on the similarity of the causal organisms of Johne's disease and leprosy, attempted the use of chaulmoogra oil for treating clinical cases, with inconclusive results. Dawnham [1929] also used chaulmoogra oil in six cases and reported 50 per cent success.
March, 1950] K. RANGANATHA RAO 21 Attempts were also made in India to treat cases with spleen extracts and egg al- bumin. In Mysore, under the present scheme, the curative value of chaulmoogra oil was investigated. Several brands of the oil were analyzed and the best, approxi- mating to B. P. standard was employed in the treatment experiments. The different brands of oleum chaulmoogra obtained from Bengal Immunity Company as well as oleum hydnocarpi received from Madras Medical Stores, were all analyzed. As the oleum hydnocarpi from Madras Medical Stores was recommend- ed as the best, it was selected. The subjects for treatment selected from the experi- mental herd consisted of a few naturally affected cases of Johne's disease and a larger number of cattle artificially infected with the disease. The artificial infection was accomplished in the following manner : A representative piece of the bowel of a confirmed case of Johne's disease was collected and, after removing the serous covering and fat, was cleaned with distilled water and then cut into small bits with a pair of scissors and ground with normal saline till a fairly thick emulsion was obtained. The material was then filtered through cotton wool to remove larger bits and a loopful of the filtrate was then examined after appropriately staining it. If the material showed large clumps of Johne's bacilli crowded up in each field it was employed for infecting. Each animal received 100 c.c. of this filtrate administered orally. It may be stated that while selecting these subjects, a positive reaction to allergic tests was taken as the evidence of the disease in the artificially infested cases. A batch of 37 animals selected for these experiments was divided into two groups of 20 and 17 each. The former of 20 made up of five clinically affected cases, two suspected clinical animals and 13 artificially infected cases, received treatment with oleum hydnocarpi (chaulmoogra oil) in the manner described below ; the latter batch of 17, consisting of three naturally affected cases and 14 artificially infected cases, was left untreated as controls vide Appendix II. The treatment consisted of drenching the infected animals at weekly intervals with oleum hydnocarpi (chaulmoogra oil) at the rate of 5 c.c. per 100 lb. body weight shaken up with 4 to 5 ez. of clcum lini and half a pint of water. The dose was arrived at after preliminary tests with varying doses, when it was found that this dose of 5 c.c. per 100 lb. body weight was well tolerated without any ill effects. Of the 20 animals thus treated, the majority, i.e. 13 had received treatment for a period of nine months which was also the longest period for which an animal was treated. The clinical cases showed no improvement in their general condition as a result of the treatment nor was there any significant variation in the general condition of the artificially infected cases inspite of good feeding and mineral supplements. The results of post-mortem examination undertaken on these animals after the conclusion of the treatment have shown that of the 20 treated six were positive for Johne's disease and the rest negative. Out of the 17 animals left as controls only three were found positive for Johne's disease, the remaining being negative for Johne's disease.
22 OBSERVATIONS ON JOHNE'S DISEASE IN MYSORE [Vol. XX, Part 1, Oleum chaulmoogra had no appreciable effect on advanced cases of Johne's disease even after a prolonged course of treatment and the findings obtained with the cases which were artificially infected with the disease do not admit of any definite conclusions being drawn owing to the controls having failed to take up the infection uniformly. SUMMARY The incidence of Johne's disease in animals on various Government Farms as well as in villages is described. The possibility of reproducing the disease in sheep, goats, guineapigs and rabbits is discussed. Johnin was found to be more reliable than avian tuberculin as adiagnostic agent. Corrugations in the intestine were not present in all Johne's disease infected animals. Treatment with oleum chaulmoogra was found to be of no use.

STUDIES ON THE METHODS OF PREPARATION OF V*., MODIFICATIONS OF THE INDIGENOUS PROCESS By K. S. RANGAPPA and B. N. BANERJEE, Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (Received for publication on 22 February 1947) ONE of the defects of the desi method of manufacture is that butter is not generally washed, and that it cannot be washed satisfactorily owing to its lumpiness and pasty consistency. In the creamery or barrel process of churning cream, the grains of butter are slowly built up, and they are washed twice with water, so that the acidity is reduced to a large extent. The storage property of creamery butter is therefore, about ten times better than that of desi butter. Im- provements in this line are therefore necessary in the desi process also. After a number of trials, a simple process of washing butter in the village on a small scale has been devised. WASHING OF BUTTER Experiment Two-litre lots of buffalo milk of 6.4 per cent fat and 0.13 per cent lactic acid were boiled for five minutes, and seeded as usual in three earthen pots. After 18 hours the acidity of the curd was determined and churned in the vessels with a country churn, until the butter granules were about 1 mm. in size. Water was added from time to time during churning up to a volume equal to that of the curd. In the first pot, butter was then collected into a lump. In the second pot the lump of butter so collected was washed three times with twice its volume of water. In the third pot, the bottom layer of butter-milk was carefully siphoned off with a rubber tube, leaving behind the discrete butter granules. (The butter-milk may be churned again and the last traces of fat recovered.) Four litres of water (twice the volume of the curd) were then poured into the churning pot containing the butter grains and gently rechurned for one to two minutes, taking care not to overchurn the butter. This washed off the butter-milk from the grains. The washed granules were then collected into a lump and converted into ghee both by the boiling and the decantation methods. They were examined for acidity and article quality as described in article III of this Series. The results are given in Table I. Discussion The results in Table I clearly indicate the effectiveness of the simple method of washing butter grains. Without reducing the yield, the acidity and quality of ghee are very perceptibly improved. A result of this procedure worthy of notice in that the acidity of ghee is very nearly the same as that of washed butter, which is thrice as low as that of unwashed butter and about half as that of ghee from unwashed * The earlier four articles of the Series were published in June, 1946 issue of this Journal.

The simplicity of the device and the large benefits resulting from its adop- tion should recommend themselves to the farmer who makes butter for the market. MODIFICATIONS IN THE METHOD OF PREPARATION OF GHEE A number of attempts have been made to prepare ghee directly from cream or cream-made butter. Kothavalla and Cox [ 1927 ] reported the preparation of good-flavoured ghee with better yields by boiling butter made from soured cream. Steward and Banerjee [ 1929 ], however, found that the distinctive aroma was present only in ghee prepared from soured milk. This observation has been confirmed by Doctor, Banerjee and Kothavalla [ 1940 ] who compared the qualities of ghee made by the curd process and from unsoured milk. They found that ghee by the latter process lacked flavour though it gained in keeping quality. But French [ 1936 ] claimed to have obtained better flavoured ghee by boiling diluted and reseparated cream than from soured-cream butter or soured-milk butter. Wright [ 1937 ], however, states that experienced ghee merchants are of opinion that the souring of milk in the ' country ' process imparts a particularly acceptable flavour to ghee while ghee made by the separator method is of inferior quality. Workers at the Imperial Dairy Institute (Annual Report 1940) reported that milk curdled with 0.5 per cent citric acid yields ghee of better quality. It is also mentioned that reseparated cream yields 88 to 98 per cent of its fat as ghee against 80 to 84 per cent without reseparation, and that the indigenous method gave the least yield, the loss being as high as 24.7 per cent. But the acidity, storage property and other qualities have not been studied. Experiments were, therefore, carried out to study these properties in ghee as well as the yield. The following series of experiments were conducted with cow's milk of 0.14 per cent acidity and 6.4 per cent fat and with buffalo milk of 0.13 per cent acidity and 7.6 per cent fat. While boiling the butter or cream into ghee, the temperature
March, 1950] K. S. RANGAPPA AND B. N. BANERJEE 29 was never allowed to rise above 110°C. and the ghee was filtered through a muslin cloth, weighed and stored. The room temperature varied between 26°C. and 28°C. during the course of the experiments. Curd process (a) Two litres of milk were boiled in a five-litre earthen pot, cooled and seeded as before. After souring for 18 hours the curd acidity was determined and then churned with a country churn in the earthen pot itself. During churning, water was added from time to time equal to the volume of the curd. When the butter granules were 1 mm. in size, the butter-milk was carefully siphoned off. (The fat in the butter-milk was determined by the Gerber process.) Four litres of water were then poured into the earthen pot and gently churned so that all the butter- milk was washed off the granules of butter. Butter was collected, excess water drained off and boiled into ghee. (b) Two litres of milk were separated into 40-45 per cent cream, diluted with water to two litres and churned. The butter was then boiled into ghee. The fat in the butter-milk was determined as before. (c) Milk was separated into cream as before. (It would no doubt be advantageous in making ghee directly from cream to make the cream as thick as possible; but the cream with fat higher than 45 per cent entails a greater fat loss in the skim milk.) Cream was boiled over a low flame with stirring to avoid charing of casein. Heating was continued until all moisture was driven off and the casein was coagulated, leaving a clear fat layer. In order to give the ghee the requisite flavour the casein was slightly browned while heating. This also helps in the better recovery of fat. (d) Cream from two litres of milk was brought to boil, cooled, seeded and soured for three hours at 37°C., when the cream developed a mild butter flavour and then boiled into ghee. (e) As it was found that the acidity of ghee from diluted and reseparated cream was almost the same as that from direct cream, washing of the cream by gentle churning in a bottle churn was tried. The cream thus churned was reseparated and boiled into ghee. In order to try the effect of citric acid on ghee flavour three more experiments were conducted.

At 1.1 per cent acidity of the curd, the five lots were churned with 30, 50, 100, 200 and 300 per cent of water respectively at the room temperature of 25°C. Ghee was reprepared by the boiling process. The churning time and properties of ghee were determined as before. The results are given in Table IV.

Beyond this, at greater dilutions there is no improvement, but there is risk of increased fat loss in buttermilk. Therefore, dilution of the curd with an equal volume of water is the best for churning. It will also be noticed that the keeping quality of ghee increases to some extent with increasing dilution of the curd. Churning Two methods of churning were tried. One was the country process in which a wooden churner with a corrugated surface attached to a bamboo pole is rotated by drawing alternatively the two ends of a rope coiled a few times round the pole in a wide-mouthed earthen pot of about ten litres capacity. The other was a ' Dazey' American bottle churn of four litres capacity in which the paddles revolve in one direction only. Buffalo milk was steamed, cooled and seeded with the laboratory seed. When the curd reached one per cent acidity after 20 hours at the room temperature of 17°C. to 25°C., one lot was churned in the country churn and the other in the bottle churn. Curd was diluted with an equal volume of water. The acidity, churning time, flavour of butter and ghee by the boiling process were determined. The experiments were repeated with unprocessed milk, using a village seed. The results are given in Table V. The mechanical churn clearly shortens the churning time, otherwise there is little to choose between the two churns in the matter of yield and quality of the resulting ghee.

Among a number of methods of making ghee from curd and cream, it has been found that ghee made from cream +0.1 per cent citric acid possesses good flavour and keeping quality. The yield is also high. The effect of starter, dilution and acidity of curd and type of churn have also been studied. The quality of starter used for making curd determines to a considerable degree the yield and quality of ghee. Dilution of curd, when churning, with an equal volume of water appears to be the optimum proportion for yield and quality of ghee. The American paddle churn compared to the village churn, while shortening the churning time, does not affect the yield. REFERENCES Dastur and Kothavalla (1940). Rep. Imp.

COMPOSITION OF MILK OF INDIAN ANIMALS I. FREEZING POINT, LACTOSE, CHLORIDE AND ACIDITY IN THE MILK OF DIFFERENT BREEDS OF ANIMALS By C. S. DHARAMARAJAN, R. VENKATESWARA RAO, M. N. MENON and NOSHIR N. DASTUR, Indian Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 15 August 1949) FREEZING point has now been accepted as the most reliable test for the detection of adulteration of milk with small quantities of water. Various aspects of the subjects have been studied ever since the classical work of Monier-Williams [1944] and it is not proposed to go into details here. Im- portant data on the freezing point of milk have been recently summarized by the Department of Health, Scotland [1943]. With regard to the freezing point of Indian animals Leather [1914] found the freezing point of milk of individual cows to vary from 36 COMPOSITION OF MILK OF INDIAN ANIMALS [Vol. XX, Part I, EXPERIMENTAL (i) Determination of freezing point. The freezing point was determined by the standard technique using Hortvet Croyoscope as outlined by the A. O. A. C. [1946]. The thermometer used for noting the freezing point was standardized at intervals against 7.0, 8.5 and 10.0 per cent A. R. sucrose solutions, and also checked against a standard N. P. L. certified thermometer. Each day before taking readings with samples, freezing point of fresh glass distilled water was determined to check the zero of the thermometer. Each reading given in the Tables is a mean of two determinations. It is well known that this technique gives depression which is about March, 1950] C. S. DHARAMARAJAN AND OTHERS 37 freezing point of individual and herd cow milk samples lies within the range of 38 COMPOSITION OF MILK OF INDIAN ANIMALS [Vol. XX, Part I, The lactose content of buffalo milk is distinctly higher than in cow milk, the average being 5.26 per cent. No difference was noticed in the lactose content of milk of the two breeds of buffaloes studied. Milk from individual buffaloes shows wider fluctuations in lactose content, the average ranging from 4.99 to 5.41. Nearly 93 per cent of herd milk samples have lactose content within the range of 3.51 to 5.50. In the case of milk from individual animals a large number of samples have lactose content between 5.51 to 6.00 per cent, the number varying widely from animal to animal. In the case of buffalo No. 272 this was as high as 40 per cent of the total samples examined. Chloride in milk Data for the amount of chloride in milk are given in Tables III and V. The average chlorine content of cow was 0.89 per cent. In the case of herd milk the average varied from 0.082 to 0.097 per cent. Sahiwal cow milk contained the least amount of chlorine, while Tharparkar cow milk was the richest in chlorine content. Samples from individual animals of the same breed show wide fluctuations in the chlorine content of milk. The chlorine content of nearly 97 per cent of cow milk samples lies within the range of 0.071 to 0.130 per cent. Davies [1938] also reported fluctuations in the chloride content of milk, the average in different breeds varying from 0.085 to 0.128 per cent. Buffalo milk contains less chlorine than cow milk, the average being 0.072 per cent. There was no difference in the chloride content of two breeds of milk studied. Buffalo milk shows a wider scattering in the distribution of chlorine content than cow milk ranging from 0.031 to 0.190 per cent, though the majority of the samples are covered by the range 0.051 to 0.130 per cent. Relationship between lactose, chloride and freezing points It is well known that these constituents of milk are closely related. The relation- ship between lactose and chloride have been formulated by several workers. This has been reviewed by Davies [1939] who found the following relationship for the amounts generally found in milk : Lactose (per cent) +13.5 Cl2 (per cent)=6.26 This factor was calculated from the data obtained in the present studies and the results are shown in Table VI. The average for cow herd milk was 6.10, for indivi- dual cow milk 6.13, for buffalo herd milk 6.18 and for individual buffalo milk 6.27. It was noticed that in a large majority of samples the factor was lower than the average suggested by Davies [1939]. Buffalo milk as a rule gave higher figures than cow milk. Staub [1926] has shown that the freezing point depression of milk was due to three main classes of compounds, viz. lactose, chlorides and residual substances. Taking the average freezing point of milk as March, 1950] C. S. DHARAMARAJAN AND OTHERS 39 0.0532°C. and 1 mg. of Cl2 of 0.0018°C., the contribution of lactose and chloride to the freezing point of milk was calculated from the average figures with the follow- ing results : Cross-bred cow milk 78.6 per cent Gir cow milk 76.1 do. Sahiwal cow milk 76.2 do. Sindhi cow milk 76.0 do. Tharparkar cow milk 77.9 do. Dharwar buffalo milk 71.8 do. Murrah buffalo milk 73.0 do. Staub [1926] formulated a contribution of 74.5 per cent by lactose and chlo- ride to the freezing point of milk. Porcher and Chevallier [1923] on the other hand obtained a figure of 77 per cent. The results show that the contri- bution of lactose and chloride to the freezing point of milk from Indian animals is generally of the same order as that given by other authors inspite of the variation in the percentage of lactose and chlorine in milk. Acidity in milk The results for the acidity in milk are summarized in Tables IV and V. The average figures for acidity in cow and buffalo milk are very similar and come to 0.12 lactic acid. For cow milk the large majority of samples lie within the range of 0.09 to 0.18 per cent, whilst in the case of buffalo milk this range extends from 0.07 to 0.020. The acid values given here have been determined using the improved method of A. O. A. C. [1946] and for this reason the results are inclined to be a bit lower than the figures usually found in the literature [c. f. Davies, 1939]. SUMMARY Nearly 1,300 samples of cow and buffalo milk have been examined for freezing point, lactose, chloride and titrable acidity. Over 96 per cent of cow and buffalo milk samples show freezing point depression greater than 0.530°C.

Sc., M. S. (Calif.), Lecturer in Animal Husbandry, Madras Veterinary College, Vepery, Madras and R. O. BERRY, Associate Professor of Animal Husbandry, Texas A. and M. College (Received for publication on 25 June 1949) (With Plates II48 OBSERVATIONS ON SPERM DEVELOPMENT [Vol. XX, Part I, This present work was undertaken in an attempt to get a better understanding of sperm physiology, especially on the function of the cytoplasmic drop and the mechanism of its descent and extrusion. It was also desired to trace the origin and development of the cytoplasmic cap in the three species studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS The animals included in this study are the ram, the goat, and the wild Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia). The male gonads and epididymis were obtained from goats and Barbary sheep by castration and the entire reproductive tracts of rams were obtained at the time of slaughter. In all cases examination was made within half-an-hour after obtaining the material. Portions of this material were stored at 45°F. for further studies. The Barbary sheep is a native of North Africa and belongs to the same subfamily as sheep and goats. It was included for comparative studies of sperm morphology of different genera in the subfamily Caprinae. Material was obtained from the epididymis by making an incision at the desired region and transferring the exuded material by means of a glass rod or by touching the cut surface to a drop of saline solution on the slide. Similar procedures were adopted for obtaining material from the testis for examination. The staining techniques used in this study were largely those given by Rao and Berry [1949b]. The concentration of sperm was determined by using a Spencer bright-line haemocytometer, and the desired dilution was made with a saturated aqueous solution of chlorazene. The saturated chlorazene solution was found to bring about uniform dispersion of the sperm without increasing the number of tailless sperm. The rams used were 1½ to 3 years of age and most of these animals were not used for breeding. The goats ranged from 1½ to 3 years and only one animal was used for breeding, the previous year. The Barbary sheep was about three years old. RESULTS Development of ram sperm In preparations from the testis of the ram, spermatozoa can be seen in various stages of development. The majority of sperm in this organ have the cytoplasmic drop, the position of which is variable. In a few sperm it is seen as a cytoplasmic mass surrounding the posterior half of the head. In some sperm it is found at the base of the head and completely surrounds the neck and extends on to the connect- ing piece. The connecting piece is found to be filiform and distinctly thinner than the main part of the tail and may also be tortuous. Many sperm in the testis have the cytoplasmic drop at the anterior end of the connecting piece as a globular mass of cytoplasm, which does not encroach on the neck region. They often show a tortuous or wavy condition of the connecting piece which is normal in thickness and development, but some sperm also have a straight and well developed connecting piece. In smears stained by Wiegert's iron haematoxylin and safranin [Rao and Berry, 1949b] the cytoplasmic drop is seen to take the basic stain and appears brown while the head appears light black in colour. Most of the testicular sperms in the ram present at the anterior end of the head a process similar to the protoplasmic cap demonstrated for the bull sperm by
March, 1950] C. K. RAO AND R. O. BERRY 49 Rao and Hart [1948a]. This process extends on the sides to about the middle of the sperm head and completely surrounding the acrosome, but it presents great variation in its size and extent of development. This cap takes the basic stain and appears light brown, while the head takes the nuclear stain and appears light black or blackish-brown. In preparations from the head of the epididymis the cytoplasmic drop on a majo- rity of the sperm is located at the anterior end of the connecting piece as a compact mass of cytoplasm (Plate II, fig. 1). In some the drop is at various levels down the connecting piece, but may exhibit a wavy condition if the drop is at the anterior end. The proportion of the sperm as regards the position of the drop can be seen in Table I. Cytoplasmic drops which are located on the anterior half of the connecting piece are termed anterior drops, while those located on the posterior half of the connecting piece are called posterior drops.

50 OBSERVATIONS ON SPERM DEVELOPMENT [Vol. XX, Part I, In the body of the epididymis the proportion of the different types of sperm varies according to the relative location within this organ. In the upper third of the body, sperm with anterior drops are more numerous while in the lower third sperm with posterior drops are more abundant. In this region the connecting piece on the sperm shows normal development and the cytoplasmic cap is quite prominent. In the tail of the epididymis the cytoplasmic drop is found to be absent from a large number of sperm (Plate II, fig. 2). The proportion of the various types of sperm in this region are shown in Table I. The cytoplasmic cap can still be seen, although it is more or less restricted to the anterior end of the sperm head on most of the sperm. In the ampulla of the vas deferens, the majority of sperm do not possess the cytoplasmic drop (Table I) and the ejaculated sperm rarely ever show the drop. The cytoplasmic cap is still noticeable, though not as distinct as on sperm from the deeper regions. Even in ejaculated ram sperm, the cap can be demonstrated and this probably corresponds to the vesicle described for the ram sperm by Green [1940]. When viewed on flat the ejaculated ram sperm are oval with the broadest portion lying about the middle of the head (Plate II, fig. 2). When the whole testis was stored in the refrigerator, the cytoplasmic cap and the drop disappeared from a large number of sperm from the testis as well as from sperm in regions of the epididymis. When ejaculated ram semen is stored, the cap disappears from most of the sperm depending upon the period of storage [Green, 1940]. Development of motility in ram sperm Motility is an early characteristic of the developing sperm and can be demons- trated even in sperm from the testis. Using the techniques described by Rao and Hart [1948b] it was found that the testicular ram sperm are capable of locomotion, though this is restricted to lashing movements of the tail with very little progression. Movement becomes more active as the sperm travel down the epididymis. Sperm examined immediately after collection from the tail of the epididymis with- out diluting exhibit maximal motility with the formation of waves and eddies, presenting the typical appearance of a whirlpool. When a drop of the epididymal fluid is mixed with a drop of warm 0.9 per cent saline, motility was greatly increased. The various types of movement exhibited by sperm from the tail of the epididymis when diluted with saline solution and the mechanism of this locomotion resemble that described for the bull sperm [Rao and Hart, 1948b]. When motility is maximal, the sperm always maintain the on edge position and travel in a linear direction, with slight changes in its path affected by lateral bendings of the head about the flexible neck. Most of the sperm with drops also exhibit maximal motility. The fluid from the tail of the epididymis was of about the same consistency as the ejaculated semen. The concentration of sperm in this fluid is given in Table II. Material collected from the head and body of the epididymis was sticky and highly viscous. Sperm from the ampulla also exhibit maximal motility, and their con- centration in this region was lower than in the tail of the epididymis (Table II).

A small portion of the head of the epididymis was dissected and multiple incisions were made on this part, which was then dropped into 1c.c. of warm normal saline, and incubated at 100°F. for about 15 minutes. Material from the body of the epididymis was similarly dealt with and examination for motility was made at five-minute intervals. It was found that though this procedure induced a more active movement, the sperm did not exhibit maximal motility.
52 OBSERVATIONS ON SPERM DEVELOPMENT [Vol. XX, Part I, Fluid collected from the tail of the epididymis was diluted with warm normal saline and incubated at 100°F. for 15 minutes. After incubation the proportion of sperm with posterior drops was greatly reduced. This was apparently caused by the more effective lashing of the tail due to the lowered sperm concentration and the reduced viscosity. Development of the spermatozoa of the goat Sperm development in the goat is almost identical with our findings in the ram. The sperm from the testis showed the cytoplasmic drop either surrounding the posterior part of the head, surrounding the neck or situated at the anterior end of the connecting piece (Plate III, fig. 3). Sperm of the first two types possess a filiform connecting piece, while some of the third type have a tortuous though well developed connecting piece. The cytoplasmic cap is common on most of the sperm and is very prominent, presenting the same staining reaction as the ram sperm. In the head of the epididymis the majority of the sperm have a large and com- pact cytoplasmic drop at the anterior end of the connecting piece. The connecting piece of most sperm is normal in development, although sperm with a tortuous connecting piece may occasionally be found. Sperm with a filiform connecting piece were not observed in the head of the epididymis. The proportion of the various types of sperm in this can be seen in Table I. Practically all sperm show the cytoplasmic cap distinctly. In the tail of the epididymis, most of the sperm do not have the drop (Plate III, fig. 4), and the cap is quite prominent. The ejaculated goat sperm when viewed on flat present a head which is broad at the base carry- ing about the same width from the base to the apex. Development of motility in the goat sperm Observations made in this species are similar to our findings on the ram sperm. Motility, though exhibited by sperm from the testis and the head and body of the epididymis, is only passive with very little progression. The material obtained from these regions is found to be viscous and sticky. Active motility could not be induced even after providing optimal environmental conditions to those sperm as described for the ram. Fluid collected from the tail of the epididymis and examined immediately with- out diluting showed that the sperm in this region are capable of maximal motility, presenting the appearance of a whirlpool, as in the case of the ram sperm. The types of motility and mechanism of sperm locomotion are the same as in the case of the bull and the ram. Development of sperms in the Barbary sheep The sperm development follows in general the account given for the ram and the goat. The position of the cytoplasmic drop on the testicular sperm is similar to that in the other two specie. Sperm with a filiform connecting piece and those with a tortuous connecting piece are frequent in smear from the testis. Most of the sperm in the head of the epididymis have the drop at the anterior end of the connecting piece, while the drop is absent on many of the sperm from the tail
March, 1950] C. K. RAO AND R. O. BERRY 53 region. The results of this study are shown in Table I. The cytoplasmic cap is noticeable on most of the sperm presenting varying degrees of development, being most pronounced in the sperm from the testis and the head of the epididymis. When viewed on flat, the sperm head in this species is found to be similar in appearance to the goat sperm except that it is slightly narrower and smaller. Development of motility Our results in this species correspond to the results obtained with the ram and goat sperm and do not require special mention. Sperm from the tail of the epididy- mis exhibit maximal motility. The consistency of the material obtained from the various parts of the reproductive tract is similar to that in the ram and goat. DISCUSSION In the ram, goat and Barbary sheep, the cytoplasmic drop is seen at three different positions on the testicular sperm. In some sperm it completely surrounds the posterior half of the sperm head and probably corresponds to the protoplasmic cuff reported by Selivanova [1939]. Some sperm have the drop posterior to the head and completely surrounding the neck, while other sperm have the drop as a compact mass at the anterior end of the connecting piece, behind the neck. These three types presumably represent successive stages in the development of the testi- cular sperm. There are also present in the testis two types of sperm which are not ordinarily found in the ejaculate or in the lower part of the epididymis. To the first class belong sperms which have a filiform connecting piece which may at times also show a wavy condition. The second type of sperm have the connecting piece of normal thickness but tortuous in appearance. These two types of sperm are quite abundant in preparations from the testis and the former presumably represents an earlier stage in the development of sperm. In the head of the epididymis in all three species a great majority of the sperm have the drop at the anterior end of the connecting piece, which is usually normal in development and appearance. However, it is not unusual to find a few sperm with a tortuous connecting piece. In the body of the epididymis this drop is located at various levels on the connecting piece and in the tail of the epididymis it is usually absent from a large number of sperm. The extrusion of the drop is probably brought about by the active movement of the sperm in this region and the sperm that still possesses the drop could not get rid of it due to the restricted movement and partial clumping or sticking together of sperm. The descent of the drop seems to be controlled largely by factors which are internal rather than external, owing to the fact that sperm with posterior drops may be found in considerable numbers in the head of the epididymis and sperm with anterior drops may occasionally be present in large numbers in the body of the epididymis. It appears that the cytoplasmic drop is associated with sperm maturation and presumably has a nutri- tive function [Rao and Hart, 1948a], this being supported by the following facts : (i) The filiform or tortuous connecting piece on the sperm is seen only when the cytoplasmic drop is situated at the anterior end of the connecting piece or higher up at the base of the head ; and (ii) the cytoplasmic drop is large
54 OBSERVATIONS ON SPERM DEVELOPMENT [Vol. XX, Part I, and compact and firmly adherent when situated at the anterior end of the connect- ing piece and gets smaller, less compact and loose as it goes down the connecting piece. The connecting piece is normal in appearance when the drop is at the posterior end. It also appears that the function of the drop is completed when it reaches the posterior end of the connecting piece and is no longer needed by the sperm. In preparations from the testis, the epididymis and the ejaculate, the vast majo- rity of the sperm are seen to possess at the anterior end of the head a cytoplasmic cap in all the three species. Using Weigert's iron haematoxylin and safranin, this cap takes a cytoplasmic stain, while the head takes a nuclear stain. This cap is probably a cytoplasmic remnant and its persistence throughout the development and even after the maturation of sperm suggests that it might be differentiated for some specific function. Recent work [Johnston and Mixner, 1948] points to the bull spermatozoa as capable of secreting the enzyme hyaluronidaze, which has been demonstrated to be capable of dispersing the corona radiata cells of the ovulated mammalian ovum. It is possible, as suggested by Rao and Hart [1948a] that this cytoplasmic cap, along with the acrosome, is involved in the process of secreting this enzyme. It appears that after leaving the testis the only changes in morphology of sperm are confined to the cytoplasmic cap and the drop, the former undergoing partial regression, while the latter changes its position. According to Milovanov [1934], the spermatozoa of farm animals rotate round their longitudinal axis owing to the asymmetrical structure of the head. Our observations on sperm development in the ram, goat and Barbary sheep suggest that the sperm head in these species does not show any asymmetrical structure during its development. The sperm head in these species is flattened from side to side, and roughly biconcave in the 'on edge ' position. In the ' on flat ' view, the shape of the head is characteristic for each species. The goat sperm and sperm of the Barbary sheep are more nearly alike in appearance. In the three species, the sperm are differentiated for motility very early in their development, but movement of the sperm is suppressed by unfavourable environ- mental conditions of which viscosity of the medium and high sperm concentration are quite important [Rao and Hart, 1948b]. Although capable of slight movement, active motility cannot be induced in sperm from the deeper regions of the male reproductive tract, even when suitable conditions are provided. This raises the question of the physiological maturity of the sperm. It is also noticeable that as the cytoplasmic drop goes down the connecting piece, the sperm exhibit a slightly more active movement. Finally, maximum motility is initiated in vivo in the tail of the epididymis in the ram, the goat and the Barbary sheep. The factors involved in the initiation of motility are probably the physiological maturity of the sperm combined with the lowered viscosity and lower sperm concentration. It appears doubtful, however, that the secretions of the tail of the epididymis have any specific stimulatory effect on sperm movement. Our observations on the induction of sperm motility are in direct conflict with the accepted theories, in this respect. Epididymal fluid is considered to be the most favourable medium for the maintenance of sperm viability. According to Milovanov [1934] the low content of the epididymal fluid in chlorine ions and electrolytes
March, 1950] C. K. RAO AND R. O. BERRY 55 generally and its acid reaction favour the transition of the sperm into a state of anabiosis. The same authority considers that the high content of electrolytes (particularly NaCl) and the alkaline reaction of the accessory secretions are mainly responsible for the initiation of sperm movement. Walton [1933], on the other hand, is of the opinion that the function of the accessory secretions is mainly mechanical, giving bulk to the ejaculate and rendering the peristaltic contractions of the urethra more effective in ejaculation. In the boar it appears that removal of the contribu- tions of the seminal vesicles and Cowper's glands from the semen increases the duration of sperm motility, and the presence of the accessory secretions is not essen- tial for fertility in the boar [McKenzie, Miller and Bauguess, 1938]. Rao and Hart [1948b] reported that the sperm from the tail of the epididymis in the bull did not move in vivo, but maximal motility could be induced in a few minutes by diluting with 0.9 per cent saline. They also reported the initiation of sperm movement in vivo in the ampulla in the bull. It is obvious that the accessory secretions do not have any factor which is specific in initiating sperm movement. It appears that the accessory secretions favour sperm movement by the following ways : 1. In those species in which sperm do not move in the tail of the epididymis the accessory secretions initiate sperm movement by lowering the viscosity of the epididymal fluid and also reducing sperm concentration. In those species where sperm from the tail of the epididymis exhibit maximal motility, sperm movement at ejaculation is augmented by the humoral medium from the accessory glands. 2. The high content of NaCl in the accessory secretions probably also stimulates sperm movement. 3. The higher temperature of the accessory secretions greatly helps to accentuate sperm motility. That the spermatozoa undergo maturation during their passage through the epididymis can no longer be questioned. This is indicated by the morphological changes that sperm undergo as they pass through the epididymis, represented by changes in position of the cytoplasmic drop, the regression of the cytoplasmic cap, the disappearance of the tortuousity of the connecting piece of the sperm and also by the physiological changes as evidenced by the increasing capacity for movement as the sperm go further down the epididymis. It also appears that the secretions of the epididymis have no influence on these changes in sperm morphology, which are presumably controlled largely by internal factors alone. The mechanism of locomotion and the types of motion exhibited by the sperm of these species compare favourably with that of the bull, and when motility is maximal the sperm are always found to maintain the ' on edge ' position [Rao and Hart, 1948b]. No rotation on the long axis was observed, as considerable resistance would be offered to this type of motion owing to the sperm head being broad and flattened from side to side. In fresh preparations from the testis and epididymis in these species, sperm with bent tails were found to be very rare. However, when the fluid was collected from the tail of the epididymis and stored in the refrigerator without taking precau- tions for gradual cooling, a large number of the sperm developed bent tails. It appears that sudden cooling exerts its destructive effect by killing a few of the K
56 OBSERVATIONS ON SPERM DEVELOPMENT [Vol. XX, Part I, weak sperm and causing a bent tail in some others. This characteristic is also shown even by ejaculated sperm from the ram and the goat, when subjected to rapid cooling. SUMMARY In the ram, goat and Barbary sheep, the cytoplasmic drop is present at various levels on the sperm, depending on the region from which they are collected and on their stage of development. The cytoplasmic drop may be found in any of the following locations on the sperm. 1. Surrounding the posterior half of the head. 2. Surrounding the neck of the sperm and continuous with the base of the head. 3. At the anterior end of the connecting piece. 4. On the connecting piece at various levels between the two extremes. 5. At the posterior end of the connecting piece. The first two types are restricted to the testis, the third is found in the head of the epididymis and the fourth type in the body of the epididymis and are most abundant in the central part or middle third of the body. The fifth type of sperm is found in large numbers in the lower third of the body of the epididymis, some in the tail of the epididymis. The descent of the drop is controlled by internal factors and not by the secretions of the epididymis. The cytoplasmic drop is asso- ciated with the development of the sperm and probably performs a nutritive func- tion. Its function appears to be complete when it reaches the posterior end of the connecting piece ; their extrusion is brought about by active movement of the sperm. Sperm with posterior drops should therefore be considered as physiologi- cally mature and normal. Sperm with a filiform connecting piece and those with a tortuous connecting piece presumably represent early and successive stages in sperm maturation. The cytoplasmic cap is a constant feature on the sperm from all levels of the reproductive tract in these animals and is found both on morphologically normal and abnormal sperm. It is always most pronounced in the sperm from the deeper regions, but can be readily observed on most of the ejaculated sperm. The sperm of these species are in maximal motion in the tail of the epididymis probably owing to the lowered viscosity and reduced sperm concentration. While the accessory secretions serve the dual purpose of adding bulk and stimulating sperm motility they are not essential for the initiation of sperm movement. REFERENCES Baylor, M. R.

D. johnin was a slightly better diagnostic agent than synthetic johnin which was superior in potency and specificity to avain tuberculin. Goats infected with intestinal scrapings or with cultures developed allergy very slowly. The lag phase in the development of allergy varied between about one to six months and is com- parable to that of cattle. The allergy waned in advanced cases but in those which developed progressive disease the allergy remained for a long time. Although a positive reaction was more significant a negative reaction did not mean that the animal was not harbouring the organisms or shedding out the bacilli in faeces. Artificially infected young goats can replace cattle for testing of johnin prior to their use in the field. Antiformin 10 and 20 per cent was usually used for the isolation of cultures from the faeces. Dunkin's medium was used and Gentian Violet (1:10,000) was incor- porated into the medium whenever intestinal materials were cultured. When administering per os large doses of the organisms were necessary to establish infection. The bacilli could be found in faeces during the incubation period and long before the onset of symptoms. A correlation between the results of the johnin test and the presence of the bacilli in the faeces was found and the balance on the whole was in favour of the allergic test. In early cases the naked-eyes lesions of the intestines were difficult to detect. In mesenteric glands in clinical cases oedema and sometimes enlargement with the thickening of the capsule and degeneration with caseous or calcified foci arranged peripherally presenting a bosselated surface were found. Histologically the intestinal lesions were similar to those seen in cattle. In the mesenteric nodes islets of epitheloids and giant cells were seen which showed a tendency to localise in the lymphatic sinuses and progressively formed syncytial masses while in advanced cases the normal glandular structure got obliterated. Caseation and calcified degeneration of the epitheloid cells was also sometimes observed. Johne's bacilli were found in smears and sections of nodules. Caseation and calcification were not found in the tonsils submaxillary and pharyngeal lymph glands, though specific histological changes were found in most of the clinical cases, the bacilli probably having had a direct entry in the lymphatics of the mouth and the pharyns. Specific bacilli were also recovered in culture from the bronchial pharyn- geal portal tonsillar and submaxillary glands in advanced clinical cases but the bacilli remained confined to the intestines and mesenteric glands in all early cases. The liver and bile were also found to be infected on culture. One infected goat which showed avain tubercle bacilli in the mesenteric gland revealed johne's bacilli in the tonsils and pharyngeal nodes but not in the mesenteric glands and intestines. The author has discussed in the end, the portal of entry of the bacillus and affirms that the main entrance is through the intestinal wall whence the lymphatic glands are invaded and the spread of infection takes place afterwards possibly through the blood stream.

ABSTRACTS 61 The use of sulfonamides in the control of Pullorum disease. ROBERTS, E., CARD, L. E. AND ALBERTS, J. O. (1948). Poult. Sci., 27, 194-200 THE various preparations used against experimental infection (S. pullorum) in chicks or poults include sulfamerazine, sodium sulfamerazine and soluble Sulfonamide No. II. They were mixed in feed and fed for 8 days to the birds which had been orally inoculated, one day of age, with known amounts of S. pullorum culture. The survivals, in percentages, at the end of 21 days were recorded. Though quantities of sulfamerazine less than 0.5 per cent in the feed were found effective in reducing mortality, the authors recommend the use of larger amounts as the degree of protection was correlated with the amount of drug in the blood. Concentrations of 1.5 per cent and 2.0 per cent in the feed were found to be toxic and 0.5 per cent was the better dosage. With poults some difficulty was experienced in controlling the infection as they ate very little of the feed during the first few days and received only small amounts of the drug. The feed consumption was, however, increased by the simple expedient of putting a few ten-days old chicks in each brooder with the poults. How long chicks should be given the medicated feed for sufficient protection was investigated. Treatment of chicks for eight days was as effective as for a longer period of ten days, while treatment for six days and less did not provide as high a a degree of protection. Tests were also made to give information about the effect of treatment at various times after inoculation. The results indicate that a period longer than three or four days before inoculation and the beginning of treatment, will reduce the protective value of sulfonamide treatment. In untreated chicks the major mortality from pullorum disease occurred well before the end of 21 days and even before 14 days. Administration of sulfonamides in the drinking water did not give results quite as good as those when mixed in the mash. The effect of sulfonamides (0.3 to 1 per cent) on the growth-rate of chicks was determined. At concentrations used in the experiments no depressing effects on growth, as judged by weight at 21 days, was observed. The average blood level of chicks on 0.2 per cent sulfamerazine in the feed was only 1.8 mg. per 100 c.c. of blood which was too low for protection. (S. G. I.)

Both the groups were fed normal ration except for the difference that one group received an average supplement of 40,382 U. S. P. units
62 ABSTRACTS of vitamin A per heifer daily. No significant difference in gain of body weight or height at withers was obtained, the control group gaining 130 lb. and 4.9 cm. and the vitamin A group 135 lb. and 4.9 cm. Another experiment with 28 heifers divided into two similar groups based upon age, body weight, blood plasma carotene, vitamin A, inorganic calcium and phos- phorus concentrations was conducted from January 1 to May 6, 1947. The vitamin A group received a supplement of 129, 400 U. S. P. units of vitamin A apart from 114,000 U. S. P. units contained in the basal ration. A significant increase in gain of body weight but not of height resulted from feeding supplemental vitamin A, the average values being 235.9 lb. and 9.4 cm. for the vitamin A group and 187.6 lb. and 8.4 cm. for the control group. General condition of the heifers in the vitamin A group was better. Mean blood plasma vitamin A concentrations of the heifers used in the first and second experiments were 18.14 and 15.82r/100 ml. for the control groups and 21 and 21.71r/100 ml. for the vitamin A fed groups. In the first trial the blood plasma carotene concentration decreased from 183 to 96r/100 ml. in the vitamin A group and from 220 to 153.. /100 ml. in the control group. The corresponding values in the second trial were 271 to 85.. /100 ml. in the vitamin A group and 278 to 156.. / 100 ml. in the control group. The increase in the blood plasma vitamin A concen- tration and the decrease in the carotene concentration in the vitamin A groups was highly significant. The cattle were fed on pasture for three months after the first experiment and it was found that the heifers receiving supplemental vitamin A had lower blood plasma carotene and vitamin A concentrations while on pasture than the heifers which did not receive supplemental vitamin A. Blood plasma inorganic calcium and phosphorus concentrations were not altered by feeding supplemental vitamin A. (I.K.)

Not unlike arsenic, chlordane destroyed the younger ticks but adult female ones were but little affected. It is superior to arsenic as it is not toxic to cattle in strength much greater than recommended. The residual effects appeared to be very high. Practically 100 per cent kill of ticks including even the female adults in the last two to three days of parasitic life was obtained with 0.65 per cent and 0.55 per cent emulsion of toxaphene.

ABSTRACTS 63 Result of trials with hexachlorethane in the treatment of Distomatosis of sheep. STAUFFRR. V. D., LOUIS GONZALES MUGABURU, REY DE CASTRO, A. (1947). North Amer. Vet., 28, 437-439 THE authors tried hexachlorethane alone and in combination with bentonite on four lots of sheep infested with F. hepalica. Lot. A consisting of four sheep was given one bolus containing 20 gm. of hexachlorethane each. Lot B consisting of six sheep was given 1½ boluses containing a total of 30 gm. of hexachlorethane and 7.5 gm. of bentonite each. Five sheep of lot C and six sheep of lot D received 20 gm. and 30 gm. of pure hexachlorethane each in the form of bolus respectively. Nine sheep were kept as controls and left untreated. The animals were not fast prior to or following the treatment. The results obtained had shown that the dry pressed form of hexachlorothane was rapidly dissolved in the ruminant digestive tract and was effective in the removal of the common liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica))of sheep from the bile ducts of the liver in a high percentage of cases. The drug had no untoward effect upon the mucous membrane of the digestive tract and had a wide margin of safety with regard to the dosages and could safely be given to the animals that were in poor condition, pregnant or nursing lambs. The larger dose of hexachlorethane-bentonite mixture (30 gm.) showed some advantage over 20 gm. dose but the 30 gm. dose of hexachlorethane alone proved to be equally efficacious. (H.S.

It was observed that the natural sexual season (which embraces the autumn and winter months) may be modified or even reversed at will by suitable artificial alteration of the daily light ration. In the ewes studied, the onset of sexual season in response to decreasing daily amounts of light, occurred 13 to 16 weeks after the change from increasing to decreasing length of day; while the cessation of sexual season took about 14 to 19 weeks after the change from decreasing to increasing length of day. The responses occurred irrespective of the level at which the change over in trend of daily lighting took place and was unrelated to specific M
64 ABSTRACTS threshold amounts of light. The length of the dioestrous interval and the duration of pregenancy were not affected by the reversal of the sexual season produced artificially. Rams. Seasonal variation in fertility of rams also appeared to be controlled by the light environment. Artificial reversal of the seasonal light conditions during summer gave rise to a period of high fertility as opposed to natural decline in libido and semen quality observed at this time of the year. The author discusses at length the role of light environment in conditioning sexual activity in animals. (S. S. P.) Application of water to the body surface of water buffaloes and its effect on milk yeild. SINHA, K. C. AND MINETT, F. C. (1947). J. Ani. Sci., 6, 258 THE authors conducted observations on some milch buffaloes in the peak of their lactation during May and June to determine whether cooling of their body surfaces by wetting with water before milking had a desirable influence on their milk yields. Four sets of observations over consecutive periods of ten days each were carried out. In the first period animals were splashed with water for five minutes both in the morning and evening before milking, in the second period splashing was omitted, in the third period the whole group was split into two, one of which was treated with splashing and the other was left un-treated, and in the fourth period all the animals were brought back to the routine practice of splashing. The results indicated that during the summer months cooling of body by wetting is essential. When this is omitted the milk yield declines and becomes irregular, the variations were found to be statistically significant. (T. A.)

The Control of the Swarming of Proteus vulgaris by boric acid.SYKES, J. A. and REED, R. (1949). J. of General Microbiol. 3, 117 THE swarming of Proteus vulgaris is mixed cultures has been a continual source of trouble to the bacteriologists. Chloral hydrate and some surface active agents suggested by some workers for controlling the swarming of Proteus did not give the desired effect with the authors when used for the isolation of gonocci from urogenital tract. Aluminium which proved to be the active part in potash alum which prevented the swarming of Proteus but inhibited the growth of other organisms lead to the trial of other members of the group 3 of the periodic table. Boron com- pounds especially boric acid was found to be very effective. The most satisfactory concentration of boric acid was found to be 0.1 per cent while one per cent affected the growth of certain bacteria and 0.05 per cent or less did not prevent the swarming of Proteus. The standard medium used for the isolation of gonocci from the urogenital tract was heated blood agar containing 20 per cent blood and 0.125 per cent boric acid. On examination of 350 specimens 56 of the control plates (without boric acid) were swarming with Proteus while none of the plates containing the above medium showed swarming. Gonocci were isolated in 38 instances in boric acid medium and only in 26 of the control plates. Electron microscope studies of Proteus vulgaris and free flagellar suspensions in media with and without boric acid and viscosimetric measurements of the flagellar suspensions suggested that the control of the swarming was probably due to the formation of a boric acid-polyhydroxylic complex, resinous in character, the for- mation of which caused flagellar disintegration. When copper sulphate was substituted for boric acid or the p H was lowered with 0.1N Hcl no changes in the flagella was noticed. (P. R. N.) Mineral Metabolism Studies in Dairy Cattle66 ABSTRACTS showed a great concentration of reduced and total glutathioneca, inorganic P, acid and alkaline phosphatase, ascorbic acid and a greater number of erthrocytes as compared with their dams. However a comparatively greater corpuscular volume and corpuscular haemoglobin content, a higher plasma level of total proteins, globulin and albumin were found in cows. Similar concentrations of various blood constituents were found regardless of the sex of the new born calf. Calves which had received colostrum prior to the procurement of blood at an average age of 4.5 hours had higher plasma levels of total proteins, globulin, and albumen, with less haemoglobin, smaller numbers of erythrocytes and a smaller proportion of whole blood volume consisting of erythrocytes (probably owing to dilution). Before the ingestion of colostrum the new born calves showed a small quantity of globulin in their plasma. (A. N. B.) The newer sulfonamides in veterinary practice. THROP, W.T.S, (1945). J. Amer. Vet. Med. Assoc. 106 75-82, 6 tables, and 9 references THE author has briefly discussed the value of different sulfonamides like sul- fathiazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamerazine, sulfaguanidine, sulfasuxidine and sul- fathalidine with regard to their toxicity and therapeutic efficiency in various dosages. The comparative value of sulfathiazole, sulfadiazine and sulfamerazine in the treatment of calf pneumonia has been ascertained and on the basis of experimental studies and clinical observations it has been shown that sulfathiazole is less toxic and just as efficient as sulfadiazine. Sulfamerazine also gives encouraging results in the treatment of the above mentioned disease. Sulfaguanidine has been proved to be efficacious against calf scours and has also been used successfully in coccidiosis both in poultry and live-stock. It is more effective for coccidiosis than either sulfathalidine or sulfasuxidine. Clinical observations have indicated that sulfathalidine and sulfaguanidine when used with or without a vitamin supplement for enteritis in swine produce good results. Sulfathalidine has proved to be of great therapeutic value against calf scours and studies on its toxicity have also given favourable indications. While prescribing, a necessary care should be exercised so that each sulfonamide is used for the purpose for which it is intended and during their administration increase in the fluid intake of the body should be made to prevent dehydration. (H. S. D.) Tuberculosis in the horse. INNES, J. R. M. (1949). British Vety. J. 105, 373-383. 9 plates and 28 references THE paper is an addition to series of papers, published by the author on this subject in this journal, reviewing the pathology of equine tuberculosis and containing a discussion on five autopsy cases. The incidence of tuberculosis, in horse concluded on the basis of post-mortems in knackeries is rare, being 0.06 per cent in Saxony, 0.14 per cent Germany, 0.09 per cent in Sweden, 0.22 per cent
ABSTRACTS 67 in Denmark and 0.07 per cent in Paris. The difficulty of finding the correct in- cidence is stressed, on account of the difficulty of carrying out complete post- mortems in knackeries and difficulty of clinical diagnosis due to unreliable tuber- culin reaction because of high percentage of 'no visible lesion reactors'. So called classical symptoms of stiffness of neck, due to affection of cervical vertebrae and infection of mesenteric lymph glands, do not appear to be really classical, after the pathology and incidence of disease is studied in detail. Primary infection is by ingestion and in horses is mainly due to bovine type of bacillus. The organs mentioned as mostly being affected include, lungs, liver, spleen and nasal mucosa. Lesion in the brain meninges, testis, pancreas, long bones, uterus and tongue have not been recorded. Though infection of pleura and peritoneum has been recorded, the typical 'Perlsucht' of cattle appears to be rate. The histological studies by the author go to confirm that lesions in horse are of chronic proliferative character and are rarely caseating and calcifying as seen in bovines and human beings. The presence of numerous giant cells in horse lesions in absence of necrosis, is taken to indicate that they are not a response to necrosis as was once believed. It is suggested that study of histology of the intestinal lesions and mesenteric glands in horse, where reaction to the bovine strain is in the form of proliferative tuberculoid and of the reaction of avian infection in horse may clear up the doubts, about the similarity of lesions of regional ileitis in horse to lesions of Johne's disease in cattle, and occurring of chronic proliferative lesions, in pigs and cows in response to avian infections.

ORIGINAL ARTICLES. MORTALITY IN SHEEP AND GOATS IN INDIA By F. C. MINETT* (Received for publication on 14 September 1949 ) THIS is an analysis of deaths among animals on certain Government sheep and goat breeding farms. Some of these are now closed. Two sets of data have been used, (a) a sample or series of at least 100 fatal cases which at my request the farm managers have been good enough to provide (Section 1), and (b) the reports submitted annually by most of the farms to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (Section 2). A comparison of the data in Sections 1 and 2 is shown in Section 3. The results of the analysis are intended to emphasize the lines along which veterinary control effort and research may be directed. It is not suggested that these results represent anything that is altogether new, since many of the facts are well-known to those concerned with the farms and are mentioned in the valuable reports thereof. The facts, however, will be the better for collation and critical analysis and will bear repetition. Moreover, the opportunity has been taken to consolidate the data so that comparisons may be as comprehensive as possible. To make the narrative more complete, the opportunity is also taken to give in outline some information regarding the farms themselves, their situation and purpose, their size, livestock population and birth-rate, and the conditions of husbandry and weather under which the stock are kept. Fuller information on many of these points can, of course, also be obtained from the reports themselves. PARTICULARS REGARDING THE FARMS 1. Banihal Banihal in Kashmir lies between Jammu and Srinagar at 5,200 ft. The sheep farm is on a mountain slope, with abundant facilities nearby for grazing and grow- ing hay and other fodder. Routine management is as follows. During the summer the flocks move up a few miles to forest grazing areas at 6,000 ft. to 12,000 ft. About November, while the 'stationary' part of the flock remains at Banihal, the migra- tory part moves down to winter forest at Reasi (Jammu), at 2,000 ft. to 3,000 ft. The journey of 80 miles across the hills takes about a fortnight, but the rams are moved by lorry in the day. At Reasi, there are also good grazing and watering facilities. There in November and December the ewes are mated and are moved again to Banihal in April where it is stated they lamb in April to June. Mating of those staying at Banihal is rather earlier. *The author was formerly Director, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteshwar and the work referred to in this paper was done during his tenure there.

70 MORTALITY IN SHEEP AND GOATS IN INDIA [Vol. XX, Part 1], The object of the farm is to test the grading-up of local ewes with imported rams Merino, Cheviot, Border Leicester and Wensleydale. The migratory flock remains in the open throughout the year, but lambing ewes are penned if the nights are rainy or cold. The stationary flock is housed from mid-November to mid- April and fed on hay. Rainfall in winter at Reasi is heavy, the normal average for the month being 4.23 in. from January to March. There are some 400 ewes. The mean annual birth-rate from 1942-46 was 237; during March 1943, 168 lambs were born. Rams and pure-bred stock are given concentrates; breeding ewes and half-breds subsist on grazing. Shearing of the local stock is thrice a year, in March, July and October, and they are dipped after the October clip. There was a good deal of trouble from fluke disease, sheep scab and in lambs from some helminthiasis. There were also heavy losses in lambs from pneumonia, caused by winter rains. 2. Peshawar The farm was actually at Togh (Kohat) at 2,500 ft. The object of the scheme was to explore the possibilities of Karakul pelt production by crossing pure Karakul rams with Hashtnagri ewes. The mean population in 1943-45 was 110 ewes and 50 young stock. Most of the lambs were born in January and February. Setbacks due to disease have been from sheep-pox in 1943-45, rinderpest in 1942, pneumonia, foot and mouth disease, and especially in 1945 what was diagnozed as pasteurellosis. There has also been lack of a good water supply. Since young stock are liable to be slaughtered soon after birth for pelt production or when about three months old, consideration of mortality rates is of little value in this flock. 3. Quetta The Bibrik breed of sheep was kept there. In summer the flock was grazed at Nigandi (9,000 ft. to 11,000 ft.), 17 miles north east of Quetta, on wild hilly country intersected by ravines. In the lower tracts of these hills the weather is hot in summer and the rainfall precarious, so that the flocks had to move. An account of the conditions at and near Nigandi and of the Bibrik breed is given in the first report [1941-43]. Normally, lambing was from end-March to mid-July, and early lambs did better than late ones. In September or October the flock moved down to a place near Sibi, a journey of 120 miles across the mountains, which occupied about two weeks. The grazing area near Sibi was subject to flooding in July-August and at the end of winter. In March the stock moved up again. Shearing was at end of May and beginning of November. Usually, rams alone were fed on concen- trates, the ewes subsisting on grazing. The scheme had many adversities, due, in part, to climate and disease factors. In 1943 and 1945, the summer rains failed and this meant lack of green grazing, so that both young and old suffered. At Sibi there were sometimes cold winter rains. The farm site at Nigandi had a nor- therly aspect, unfavourable to the early lambing desired in Baluchistan owing to the short period available there for green grazing. Every year from April to July there were outbreaks of a fatal disease, of obscure origin though well known
June, 1950] F. C. MINETT 71 in the area. An account of this disease is given in the 1943-44 report. To avoid this, the practice was to move the stock to other areas, but this in advertently proved fruitless moreover, interfered with grazing and led to excessive mortality especially in ram lambs. There was also lack of shelter, for animals and attendants. The young stock have suffered from pneumonia and from lousiness and the adults from myiasis, while in 1943 there was a severe outbreak of foot and mouth disease, 4. Hissar Bikaneri sheep have been bred at the Punjab Government Farm since 1928 and the object of the scheme (under the supervision of Mr. P. N. Nanda) has been to study methods of breed improvement, and to gain some detailed information on feeding and pasturage, breeding and general management. The flocks are accom- modated in thorn pens, with some shelter. The best mating season was found to be March to May, to produce lambs at the close of the monsoon, when ewes have plenty of milk. The rams get some concentrate feeding, but the ewes ordinarily subsist on grazing72 MORTALITY IN SHEEP AND GOATS IN INDIA [Vol. XX, Part II, these months. Watering is from a well. There is probably insufficient protection from rain and wind. From 1942-46 the ewes were allowed to lamb at almost any time of the year. At Gaya and in the early days at Monghyr there was much trouble from helminthsJune, 1950] F. C. MINETT 73 8. Etah (Uttar Pradesh) It is situated at about 300 ft. Originally, two breeds of goats were being selec- tively bred, Jamnapari and Barbari, but from 1941 the latter breed only was kept. A great deal of valuable information has been accumulated at this station under the direction of Mr. A. E. Slater on various aspects of goat breeding and dairying. There has been much trouble from disease, such as pneumonia, foot and mouth disease, goat-pox, and in the winter months bisi (probably paramphistomiasis). 9. Orai It is in District Jalaun (Uttar Pradesh) about mid-way between Kanpore and Jhansi at 770 ft. The farm of about 230 acres was started in November 1938 and in the spring of 1939 Bikaneri and local (Jalauni) sheep, about 100 of each breed, were introduced. Subsequently, the number of the combined flocks was raised to about 300. The work made a bad start due to an extensive outbreak of sheep-pox during the summer of 1939 and the following winter. Since then sheep-pox has appeared on more than one occasion, in spite of ovination. Shearing is during first halves of April and October. 10. Dhar It is in District Betul (Madhya Pradesh), at 1,260 ft. There was much disease in lambs, presumably helminthiasis, in 1945-46. Shearing is in April and October. 11. Shillong The Government Experimental Farm is at 6,000 ft. and has a rainfall of about 100 in. a year. Among others, Bikaneri and Hissardale sheep are kept. 12. Hingoli (Hyderabad, Deccan) It is at 1,500 ft. Shearing is in March and October. 13. Farms in Mysore State Hunsur Sheep breeding is practised at the Cattle breeding Station, altitude about 2,500 ft. This small flock is shorn in February. Hebbal (Bangalore District). Altitude 3,020 ft. The flock numbers some 30 only and shearing is in February. Garudapalya (Kolar District). Altitude about 2,500 ft. Shearing of the some 250 sheep is in February. Yellichihalli. It is 12 miles from Mysore City, at about 2,600 ft. Shearing is in January. There are 420 acres of rather poor land. Annual rainfall in 1940-44 averaged about 34½ in.
74 MORTALITY IN SHEEP AND GOATS IN INDIA [Vol. XX, Part II, SECTION 1 Analysis of sample data A circular letter was sent to the Superintendents of the farms asking for details of not less than 100 and preferably 200 or 300 individual deaths, provided the deaths had been distributed over a fairly long period, say two years or more. This condi- tion was fulfilled in all cases save one and usually the period covered at least three years. If there had been outbreaks involving the death of dozens or scores of animals at any one period, information for a larger series was required. The details asked for were, numbers of animals and breed, category (ewe, ram, etc.,) date of death, date of birth (or approximate age at death), and supposed cause of death. The data received have been arranged in tables ; in some cases owing to the voluminous nature of the information only totals are shown. Tables I and IV show the period covered and number of animals at each farm for which information was received ; the total numbers are 3,548 sheep and 540 goats, which may be regarded as samples of reasonable size. Age groups for total deaths When the cases are arranged in age groups, 43.3 per cent of the deaths in sheep from all causes (Table I) are found to occur before the age of one year. With in- dividual farms, extreme percentage values are 17.0 and 62.9 ; on six of the farms the figures is well above the mean. Practically 9.0 per cent of the deaths fall within the category of 'old age' which is arbitrarily defined as six years and over. With goats at Hissar and Etah (Table IV) 67.2 per cent of deaths from all causes occur before the animal is a year old,June, 1950] F. C. MINETT 75 dying from such ailments as 'diarrhoea', 'enteritis', 'anaemia', and 'debility', are included, even if worm parasites were not reported as occurring in them, if there is evidence of the widespread existence of parasitism on the farm. Where there is no such evidence, animals dying below six months of age are included in group 1. Admittedly, in making such allocations mistakes are inevitable owing to defects in diagnosis, but they may not be important on the whole and some arbitrary divi- sion has to be made. It appears from the Tables II and V that in sheep, excluding 20 per cent in adults, the age of which is not known, parasitic attack is most fatal in sheep below the age of two years and is especially heavy between the ages of 6 to 12 months. There is no great variation in this respect on the individual farms, but at Bhamburda rather more than half the deaths under this category occurred in four to five year old animals. This is exceptional and from the reports of this station it seems more likely that malnutrition resulting from climatic stress is the cause rather than parasitism. This, of course, may also be true of some other farms. With goats also, at Etah, most of the deaths from parasitic attack occur before the age of two years. Group 3. It contains all cases of six months and over in which lung affections were considered responsible for death. The total for sheep, excluding Banihal, is only 153. Banihal is excluded since there almost all the lung affections occurred in lambs from 3 to 12 months of age, suggesting that lung disease was not a primary cause of death. The reason for the general age limitation to over six months is because conditions labelled pneumonia in very young animals are quite likely not pneumonia in the true sense, but merely pulmonary congestion or oedema arising from weakness or other cause. Since, however, pneumonia may be the immediate cause of death in old animals, ones over six years of age are included in this group. If then Banihal is excluded, the heaviest incidence of pneumonia in sheep falls in the six months to two years age groups, though the figures are too small for men- tioning particular farms. Much the same is true of goats. Group 4. It contains animals dying at six years and over from no easily apparent cause. This includes cases labelled 'debility'. In one-third of the cases in sheep, the age of the 'old' animals is not stated, while there are very few cases attaining nine or ten years. Group 5. (Sheep only). It contains miscellaneous diseases or other factors con- tributing to death, which deserve mention owing to their effect on the mortality rate of individual farms. Included are sheep-pox at four farms, a disease at Quetta designated 'obscure' and about the most serious complaint at this station, tympany, rinderpest, 'encephalo-myelitis', deaths from wild animal attack, at Banihal 'rains' which were on one occasion responsible for severe loss, and finally deaths which are frankly described as of unknown origin. With sheep-pox, the heaviest mortality falls in two age groups, birth to six months and two to three years. The disease is usually said to be most fatal in lambs, but this apparently is not the case at Garudapalya. At Banihal, the effect of the heavy rains was greatest in lambs, as might be expected. The 'obscure disease' at Quetta chiefly affected adults from one year upwards. Wild animal attack caused more severe losses in lambs than in adults, whereas losses from rinderpest
76 MORTALITY IN SHEEP AND GOATS IN INDIA [Vol. XX, Part II, at Peshawar were heaviest in adults of three years and over. Losses from' encephalo- myelitis' at Hissar and from unknown causes were greatest in animals under a year old. Seasonal occurrence of deaths In Tables III and VI, deaths falling in the various groups have been arranged seasonally. Group 1. In group 1, the death rate will naturally largely depend on the season of birth. Any seasonal effect will, therefore, mean little unless births are occurr- ing with some uniformity all the year round, which they are not (Tables VII and VIII). As the present figures stand, it is seen (Table III) that for young sheep June and July are by far the healthiest months and December the worst. May is also rather high, due chiefly to events at Peshawar and Quetta. The total seasonal distribution for 443 cases may be put as follows : winter (November to February) 42.9 per cent, summer (March to June) 27.3 per cent, and monsoon period (July to October) 29.8 per cent. Differences are not significant. With goats (Table VI) the corresponding figures for 236 cases are 46.6, 37.3 and 16.1 per cent. Difference between the highest and the lowest figures is highly significant. Group 2. It contains 1,465 cases in sheep, which for purpose of the enquiry are connected with parasitism. Here again the death rate is minimum in June and July, and also in August and September, rising again from October to April. The number of deaths from November to February is significantly higher than at other seasons. The rather high incidence in March and April is due to fluke disease at Banihal. If this is omitted, a higher incidence of parasitic effects in the winter months, October to February, stands out more clearly. With 80 cases in goats at Etah, the great bulk occur from July to December. Group 3. In group 3, apart from Banihal, which seems to have a rather special incidence distribution (June to September in 1943), 54.2 per cent of the pneumonia cases in sheep occurred between October and March. The total cases, however, are only 153, very few for stations so widely distributed in India. The differences in any case are not significant. With goats at Etah, the bulk of the cases are re- turned as 'heamorrhagic septicaemia', and their occurrence is during the hot months, April to June. Group 4. In group 4, in sheep, 39.6 per cent of the deaths from 'old age' are in winter (November to February), 34.6 per cent in summer and 25.8 per cent in the monsoon. Differences are not significant. The worst month is January. Another bad month is June, due mainly to events at the farm at Dhar. Of the total deaths from 'old age', 53.9 per cent occurred between October and March. Group 5. In group 5 (sheep only), with sheep-pox at Orai, nearly 50 per cent of fatal cases occur during the dry summer season, as expected. Of the total sheep- pox deaths, 69 per cent occur between April and September. At Banihal heavy rain is likely from January to March; the rain which killed so many sheep occurred in March 1944. The obscure disease at Quetta occurred mainly in June, beginning in April and fading out in July, perhaps suggesting vector transmission. There are rather more deaths from 'unknown' causes in the winter,June, 1950] F. C. MINETT 77 October and March. Most of the 'encephalo-myelitis' cases at Hissar occurred in May and June.

On statistical analysis, however, differences are not significant either with birth rate or with death rate. It seems that there is no seasonal influence on mortality rate at this early age. Table XI for goats at Hissar (1944-45 report) shows the death rate in stock upto 18 months of age, over a period of 17 years. There is definite evidence from this series that gross mortality in younger goats is higher between October and March and least during the warm months. The death rate from January to March is significantly higher than at other seasons. It is also shown in the report by means of a graph that over the same period of 17 years what are described as the two most killing diseases, viz., pneumonia and gastritis, have a similar seasonal distribution. At Etah, pneumonia in kids is also referred to the winter months. Some cases of pneumonia, said to be associated with Pasteurella, are however stated to occur in April to August and this agrees with the direct sample data. There is little concrete information in the reports as to the seasonal incidence of disease, including fatal cases, but there are some statements which taken together give definite indications, which may be compared with those of the sample data above. From Banihal, Peshawar, Hosur and especially Hissar, there are indications that the mortality from pneumonia occurs mainly between October and March. This scarcely agrees with the direct sample data. Fascioliasis at Banihal appears from January to April. At Reasi, parasitic attack was from October to March in 1942-43, parasitic pneumonia at Peshawar from January to March, at Hosur during the winter ; at Bhamburda it is worst during the summer monsoon82 MORTALITY IN SHEEP AND GOATS IN INDIA [Vol. XX, Part II (c) According to sex The following is an unselected series of deaths in lambs in which the sex of the offspring is recorded. Number of deaths Farm Males Females Ratio (M : F) Hosur 116 108 1.074 Hissar 205 175 1.171 Monghyr 29 26 1.115 Yel 131/481 92/401 1.424/1.196 Quetta 145/626 90/491 1.611 The ratio of male to famale deaths is thus 1.196 in lambs at four farms; at Quetta, where the animal husbandry conditions are quite different, it is 1.611. Even with the four farms with the lower M : F ratio, the difference is highly signi- ficant. With kids, a small number of figures from Hissar give a M : F ratio of 3.857, the numbers being 108 males and 28 females. Unfortunately, both with lambs and kids a considerable number of deaths have occurred below 14 days of age, but the sex is not given. (d) In relation to method of rearing young stock (kids) Data taken from the Hissar reports of 1943-46, may be set out thus.

Information as to whether the kids used were singles or twins could not be obtained. It is assumed that kids 'removed from experiment' (figures given in brackets) died ; this is stated as a fact in Experiment 1. Only kids ' removed ' within three months of birth are included, except in Experiment 1 when the age at death is not stated. The data suggest that, as might be expected, naturally-fed kids are more likely to survive than hand-fed ones, but differences are not significant. (e) Mortality in relation to number of lambings in the year This question has been investigated at Hissar and the following data are taken from the reports for 1937-45. The figures are too small for significant differences. It is clearly stated that the comparison is between ewes allowed to lamb once and ewes given an opportunity to produce two lambs a year. The ewes were kept in separate pens of about 40 each.

C. MINETT 101 Comments are as follows with the sheep flocks. Hosur. The direct sample is a fair one and shows the importance of parasitic troubles. Hissar. In the direct sample, gastroenteritis and pneumonia are much higher, while the proportion of early deaths and (in group 5) 'encephalomyelitis' are lower. Monghyr. The direct sample is a fair one ; both samples show the importance of parasitic troubles or effects presumably thereof. Quetta. The direct sample is a fair one ; the importance of the ' obscure disease' (group 5) is emphasized. Banihal. In the direct samples, parasitic diseases are higher and pneumonia lower than in the reports sample. Peshawar. In the direct sample, parasitic diseases are higher and sheep-pox (group 5) lower than in the reports sample. Yellachihalli. The comparasion emphasizes the importance of parasitic diseases. With regard to the two goat flocks, it is seen that with Hissar the direct sample is a very fair one and shows the extreme importance of troubles in kids. With Etah, the reports sample emphasises the importance of parasitic disease, due to an extensive outbreak diagnosed as bisi in 1936-37. DISCUSSION This paper deals with only one aspect of sheep and goat husbandry, namely mortality, and this is not the place for any comprehensive discussion. The analysis attempted above is only a beginning and refers only to organized farms*. Many more data would have to be collected, with specific, objects before true pictures could be drawn. A study of the data emphasizes how little exact information we have as yet regarding animal disease in India, apart from some well defined condi- tions. The need for up to date research is therefore obvious, while at the same time a perusal of the reports brings out the enormous importance of the weather condi- tions which the animals may have to withstand, conditions which may of course act directly or indirectly. The climates which are most suitable for sheep-raising are tolerably well known; they have been defined, for instance, in the form of hythergraphs and climographs by Johnson [1924]. So a useful piece of research would be to produce such climographs for Indian breeds of sheep and goats. Apart *Reports regarding the following schemes were consulted 1. Madras Sheep Breeding Scheme.

102 MORTALITY IN SHEEP AND GOATS IN INDIA [Vol. XX, Part II, from all this, each of the farms participating in these schemes has its special problems. Whatever the general considerations, the problems of farms like those of Banihal and Quetta, where migration is an annual feature, are quite different from those of stationary flocks situated in other parts of the country. One cannot order the weather but one may be able to take steps to avoid the worst effects of it, e.g. by shearing at a favourable time, by giving protection during lambing, by sheltering ewes and lambs at time of excessive rain, by giving extra feed at reasonably economic levels when circumstances demand it, such as to rams before and during service to ewes before and after lambing, to all stock when grazing is scanty or when heavy parasitic attack is threatened. Regarding many of these points, the reader's atten- tion may be drawn to the writings of the late Mr. E. J. Bruen (Bhamburda reports of 1938-39, 1940-41), of Mr. P. N. Nanda (Hissar report 1940-41), and of Mr. A. E. Slater (Etah reports). A problem that requires special consideration is mortality in young stock. One of the ways to minimize this is to arrange a suitable season of birth so as to avoid excessively cold conditions for the young and so that they may have a chance of grazing before the weather turns cold. This matter has received due attention at several of the farms. SUMMARY An analysis is made of deaths among sheep and goats on certain organized farms in India. The analysis is based on (a) particulars of 100 to 300 or more fatal cases occurring on each farm over a period usually of at least three years-spoken of as ' direct sample data ', (b) data extracted from reports submitted annually to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. 2. The total number of deaths in sheep analyzed under (a) is 3,548 and in goats 540, and the data are tabulated. Deaths are dealt with under five groupings, (1) disorders of early life, (2) parasitic disorders, (3) lung affections, (4) old age, (5) miscellaneous cases, and they have been further considered according to age at death and the season of its occurrence. Within these groupings, allocations are somewhat arbitrary. For instance, group 1 includes deaths up to six months of age ; group 2 includes deaths ascribed to ' debility ', ' diarrhoea ', etc. if parasitic disease in the flock was known to be widespread ; group 3 excludes cases under six months of age ; group 4 is confined to animals of six years or over, provided there was no easily apparent cause such as pneumonia ; group 5 includes sheep-pox, deaths from wild animal attack and so on. 3. Both direct sample data and data from the reports emphasize the high death rate among younger animals. Thus, over a series of years nearly two-thirds of the mortality in sheep is in young stock, and in goats about three quarters of it. Other figures show that both in sheep and goats the mean annual mortality rate is two to four times higher in the young than in their dams. The bulk of the deaths occur in the first three months, the death rate in males being higher than in females. 4. There are suggestions that, (a) mortality in weaned kids is higher than in unweaned, (b) mortality both in ewes and lambs is relatively higher when the use are allowed to lamb twice in the year.
June, 1950] F. C. MINETT 103 5. At several of the sheep farms helminthic disease is an outstanding source of mortality, while the effect of environment, nutritional and climatic, in this connection is emphasized. The death rate from helminthic disease, both in sheep and goats, seems to be at its worst from six months to two years and especially at 6 to 12 months. In goats the majority of deaths occurred before the age of six months. 6. As to seasonal effect, the numbers of cases and the conditions on the farms are sometimes so different that no general statements can be made. Deaths in lambs and kids up to six months of age are usually more frequent in the colder weather, after making due allowance for the season of birth. Similarly, deaths in older sheep from helminthic disease and pneumonia are highest between October and March. Other examples of seasonal incidence are ; in lambs at Hissar a condi- tion styled encephalo-myrelitis in May to July, in kids at Etah a condition attributed to Pasteurella in April to August, sheep-pox April to September, an obscure disease of sheep at Quetta April to July. 7. Other information noted in passing is, (a) that with kids male births are proportionately greater than female, (b) of nearly 2,000 goats kidding at Etah and Hissar 55 per cent give twins.

PROTEINS FOR EGG PRODUCTION BY D. PARTHASARATHY and S. G. IYER, Poultry Research Section, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, Uttar Pradesh (Received for publication on 31 January 1950) IN the feeding of poultry it is a well known fact that cereals alone cannot sustain good egg production for their proteins are deficient both in quantity and quality. Besides they are deficient in some minerals necessary for egg production, e.g. calcium. In commercial farms where fowls are kept as a source of income, the deficiencies of minerals and proteins have therefore to be made good. Limestone or oystershell is usually given as a calcium supplement. But the finding of protein supplements is a difficult problem as they are the most expensive, and important too. The bulk of the experimental evidence indicates that proteins of animal origin are superior to those of vegetable origin both for egg production and growth. However, in recent years animal proteins have become very expensive and scarce. An experiment has been carried out to compare the values of groundnut cake meal and rape cake as protein supplements for egg production. Hill [1944] has reported that rape seed meal at a level of 10 per cent in the mash was satisfactory for pullets. In some parts of this country rape cake is fed as a protein supplement in the ration of cattle but as far as is known there are no reports of its use in poultry rations, In previous experiments at this Institute, Maedonald and Bose [1943] found that meat offal was a good protein supplement and approached milk which of course is an ideal protein supplement. Therefore the results are compared with meat offal. In other countries fish meal is used as a source of protein supplement in poultry feeding and in this experiment it has also been tried. EXPERIMENT Materials. The cereals and the vegetable protein supplements were obtained from the local market. The meat offal was supplied by a contractor from local slaughter houses. The fish meal was obtained from a firm in Delhi, Chemical examination of the fish meal revealed that it was not good in quality as the protein content was low, 40 per cent. However, it was decided to carry out the experiment as it would give at least some idea about its utility. Stock. Into each of five laying pens were placed about 50 Rhode Island Red pullets of about the same age and strain, and which had just started laying. The birds were fed the experimental rations for a period of 16 weeks. The data recorded in the paper have, however, been taken for the last 12 weeks leaving the first 4 weeks as a preliminary period. Housing. Each of the pens consisted of a run measuring 120 ft. by 90 ft. In the centre of the run was situated the house, made of one inch angle iron bar and wire mesh. Half-span roof chuppers with wind screen on one side of the house F 105
106 PROTEINS FOR EGG PRODUCTION [Vol. XX, Part II, made of dried grass and bamboo gave better protection against sun and rain. The run itself was enclosed on the four sides by means of wire netting. On one side of the enclosure there was a gate for entrance. Feeding. All the five groups were fed on mash only. Besides the mashes each of the pens was provided with broken limestone and water ad lib. Liberal amounts of succulent green food were also given every afternoon. The basal mash used was of the following composition : Wheat bran ...... .....25 parts Yellow maize meal..... .....35 do. Ground oats ................. ......15 do. Ground jowar ...... ..... 5 do. Group 1 (basal group) was fed the basal mash supplemented with 0.5 per cent common salt. This group served as the negative control. Group 2 (rape cake group) received a ration containing 79.5 parts basal mash, supplemented with 20 parts rape cake meal and 0.5 part common salt. Group 3 (earthnut group) was fed on a ration consisting of 84.5 parts of basal mash, 15 parts of earthnut meal and 0.5 part of common salt. Group 4 (fish meal group) was fed on a ration consisting of 84 parts basal mash and 16 parts fish meal. Group 5 (meat offal group) received the basal mash supplemented with 1 to 1.1 oz. of meat offal per bird per day. Group 1 to 4 were fed dry mash ad lib. in waste proof hoppers. The meat offal was minced and cooked for about an hour, with a small quantity of water The cooked material which became very soft, together with any liquid material that was left over, was mixed with some quantity of dry mash approximately in the proportion of 1.5 oz. dry mash for 1 oz. of meat offal per bird per day. The quantity of meat offal was adjusted from day to day to bring up to the required protein level. This was fed as wet mash in open hoppers at 4 p.m. every day before the birds went to roast. This wet mash was so much relished that the whole quantity was consumed in about fifteen minutes. The average composition of the mashes is given in Table I.

There was some how a drop in the pro- duction in all the groups during the 6th period. The average egg production figures for a period of 12 weeks were 16.9 : 33.2 : 27.3 : 31.1 : and 34.4 in groups 1, 2 3, 4 and 5 respectively. As was expected there was marked difference in the produc- tion figure of group 1 (negative control) and other groups. Egg weight.

In groups 2 and 4 there was only one death in each. In group 5 two birds were lost, one of which died because of an accident and so in this group also the actual loss may be considered as only one. The birds were weighed at the beginning of the experiment and thereafter at intervals of 4 weeks. The average weight of the birds in each group at the beginning and at various intervals are given in Table VI. The birds maintained good condi- tion throughout and in every group there was some gain in weight during the experi- mental period. DISCUSSION The groups fed on protein supplements whether of vegetable or animal origin gave better egg production than the one without. In group I the egg production was 16.9 (lowest) for a period of 12 weeks or on percentage basis, 20.1 per cent.
110 PROTEINS FOR EGG PRODUCTION [Vol. XX, Part II, A better egg production was obtained in group 3 where earthnut meal was used as the protein supplement. The production figure was 27.3 for 12 weeks or 32.5 per cent. This figure compares well with the figures of 33.5 per cent obtained by Macdonald and Bose [1943] for the same protein supplement, although it should be mentioned that in this experiment the birds were Rhode Island Reds, and the cereal base was slightly inferior to that used by the above workers. In this experiment wheat and paddy were omitted and instead only jowar, which does not have a high biological value, [Mukherjee and Parthasarathy, 1948], was used. Nevertheless better production 33.2 eggs for the experimental period or 39.4 per cent was obtained in group 2 where rape cakemeal was used. It appears therefore that rape cake can be used with advantage as a protein supplement in the ration of laying hens. This information has considerable potentialities for poultry keepers particularly in Northern India where the cake is abundant. The best egg production figure 34.4 or 4.08 per cent was obtained in group 5 in which meat offal was the protein supplement. This is slightly less than the figure 44.3 per cent obtained by Macdonald and Bose [1943]. As already stated their cereal base was better and their birds were of a different breed (Leghorn). In group 4 in which fish meal was used the production figure was 31.1 or 37.0 per cent. Fish meal has been found to be a good protein supplement by many workers, and the quality of eggs also is reported to be quite good [Marble, Nicholes and Knandel, 1938] but in this particular experiment unfortunately the fish meal used was not of the right quality. This experiment emphasises the need to analyse the individual feeds before the commencement of the experiment, as that would give an idea of the quality, and also an idea of the proportions in which they should be used. In all the groups 2, 3, 4 and 5 the egg production was increased to a varying degree by the addition of protein supplement whether of vegetable or animal origin. The lowest egg size was obtained in group 1 getting the basal mash alone. In group 2 getting rape cake meal the egg weight was only a little better. The maximum egg weight 2.11 oz. was obtained in group 4, on fish meal as supplement. The egg weight in group 5 which was getting meat offal was 2.05 oz. In group 3 getting earthnut meal the weight was a little betterJune, 1950] D. PARTHASARATHY AND S. G. IYER 111 quality. It is significant that rape cake meal was very efficient and exceeded the fish meal which was used in this experiment. As expected group 1 on basal mash alone had the lowest efficiency. The general health of the birds was quite satisfactory. Deaths were due to accidents or simple causes like egg peritonitis and colds. In all the groups there was an increase in body weight during the period of experiment. It is to be noted that in group 1 there was maximum gain. Next in order came groups 2 and 5. It is somewhat significant that in spite of greater production involving some strain on the body both groups 2 and 5 were able to put on some weight during the period of the experiment, particularly group 2. On the whole all the groups maintained good health and no untoward effects were found. SUMMARY An experiment on the comparative values of rape cake meal, earthnut meal, fish meal and meat offal as protein supplements to a laying ration was for a period of 12 weeks, with Rhode Island Red pullets. The maximum production was obtained with meat offal, rape cake meal coming next. Fish meal and earthnut meal followed in order. No significant differences in egg size were observed among the groups. Food consumption was a little high in rations containing rape cake and fish meal. The efficiency of food utilisation as expressed by the number of pounds of feed to produce one egg was highest with meat offal, rape cake, fish meal and earthnut meals following in order. The general health was satisfactory in all the birds. REFERENCES Hill, D. C. (1944). Scientific Agriculture 24, 576 Macdonald, A. J., Bose, S. (1943). Indian J. vet. Sci. 13, 150 Marble, D.

RESEARCH INTO INDIAN CITY MILK I.CHEMICAL AND BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION By R. N. NAIK, G.B.V.C., Vice-Principal and Bacteriologist, D. T. PARNAIK. G.B.V.C., Assistant Bacteriologist and P. R. DHAKE, G.B.V.C., Graduate Assistant, Bombay Veterinary College, Parel (Received for publication 1 May 1948) JOSHI [1916] collected 68 samples of milk from the stables of Bombay city and reported an average of 17,103,000 bacteria per ml. in them. He also carried out bacterial counts of 240 samples of milk collected at random from certain stables, dairies, milk hawkers and milk shops of Bombay city and found on an average 36,385,000 bacteria per ml. in them. Walton [1925 and 1927] studied the bacterial contents of milk produced at the Agricultural Research Institute Dairy, Pusa and reported that the total bacterial and coliform counts varied seasonally, the highest number occurring during the rains. The Annual Report of the Imperial Dairy Expert [1939] stated that the average plate count of milk produced at the Imperial Dairy Institute, Bangalore, was 235,000 per ml. and that the methylene blue reduction time was four hours. Verma, Kothavalla and Seshacharyulu [1945] determined plate counts of bacteria in milk samples collected both at the production and at the supply end at Bangalore city from the Imperial Dairy Institute and from the travelling milch cows showed a plate count below 500,000 per ml. and a. methylene blue reduction tim above four hours; the milk samples from milk hawkers had a plate count between 500,000 and five millions per ml. and a methylene blue reduction time of less than three hours ; and milk samples from town dairies had a plate count between one million and over 90 millions and a methylene blue reduction time below two hours. They found further a better correlation between the methylene blue reduction time of four or more hours and 200,000 or less plate counts of bacteria than between the reduction time of five and a half or more hours and 200,000 or less plate counts of bacteria. Milk is one of the essential protective foods, judging the quality of which is an important problem. The quality is judged by determining the chemical consti- tuents and bacterial contents of milk. The bacteriological examination is an in- dispensable necessity to safeguard the public health and to ensure keeping qualities of milk. It is a known fact that milk contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms which may be found in faeces of persons suffering from intestinal diseases or of persons who are carriers of the disease is dangerous for human consumption. But few have attempted to identify the bacteria found in milk supply of big cities in India or have carried out coli tests, etc., which are useful in evaluating the quality of milk. Forty samples of milk marketed in Bombay city were, therefore, subjected to almost all chemical tests and bacteriological examinations and the results obtained are reported in this paper. 113 G
114 RESEARCH INTO INDIAN CITY MILK [VOL. XX, PART II METHODS Collection of milk samples Milk is marketed in the Bombay city by (1) the Government subsidised milk shops where milk produced in the buffalo stables of the city and suburbs is sold to regular customers at the rate of 14 annas per seer, (2) the owners of stables themselves who arrange to distribute a high quality milk to regular customers at a high price, (3) milk shops owned by Bhaiyas, halwais and others who generally buy milk from buffalo owners of the city and suburbs and sell it to a few regular and a large number of other customers and (4) milk hawkers who collect milk from any producer or whole- sale dealer and sell it at the chawls of poor classes of people. In the latter two cases no standard quality or price is maintained except for a few regular customers. The samples tested by us were obtained from all these four categories but the samples from the first two sources are referred to as coming from buffalo stables and from other two as coming from milk vendors in this paper. The milk samples were collected at the supply end in the mornings between 5-45 a.m. and 8-30 a.m. in the bottles sterilized on the previous day. The milk bottles were then transferred to wide mouth thermos flasks containing ice imme- diately after collection and transported to the laboratory where they were main- tained in a refrigerator pending examination. Two samples of milk were collected alternate days. Forty samples of milk were thus collected and subjected to various tests within about four hours after collection. The tests included a determination of specific gravity, fat, total solids, total viable bacterial numbers, coli test, methylene blue reduction test, alcohol test, phenolphthalein test and cultural examination, for the identification of the milk flora. ANALYTIC PROCEDURE Chemical tests 1. Specific gravity. The Quevenne lactometer was used. Every milk sample was thoroughly shaken and brought to a temperature of 15°C. when the specific gravity of milk was calculated from its lactometer reading by dividing the lactometer reading by 1000 and adding one according to the method stated by Simmons and Gentzkow [1944]. 2. Determination of fat. This was done by adopting the Gerber's method. Strong sulphuric acid 10 c.c. was introduced into the Gerber's acid butyrometer tube and then 11 c.c. of well shaken milk was allowed to trickle slowly down so that it formed a layer upon the acid. 1 c.c. of amyl alcohol was added and the neck of the tube closed with a tightly fitting rubber stopper. The contents were then centrifuged in Gerber's centrifuge at a speed varying from 1000 to 2000 revolutions per minute for five minutes. The tubes were then transferred with the stopper downwards in a water bath maintained at 60°C. and the percentage of fat read. 3. Total solids. Direct Gravimetric method was used. Five grammes of milk were placed in previously weighed fiat bottomed dish 7 cm. in diameter, and thoroughly dried by evaporation. The dish and contents were then weighed and the total solids content calculated according to the official laboratory method of the United States Army described by Simmons and Gentzkow [1944].
June, 1950] R. NAIK, D. PARNAIK AND P. DHAKE 115 4. and 5. The solids-not-fat and water. The solids-not-fat was calculated simply by deducting the fat percentage from the total solids and the water by deducting total solids from 100. Bacteriological tests Bacterial count. This was done by adopting the method of the standard plate count described in the Laboratory methods of the United States Army by Simmons and Gentzkow [1946]. The milk agar medium contained agar 15 gm., beef extract 3 gm., peptone 5 gm., glucose 1 gm. and distilled water 1,000 c.c. The dilution used for plating were 1 in 100, 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 10,000. The colonies of bacteria were counted only on those plates which showed 30 to 500 colonies or nearest to 500 according to the method stated in the English milk order [Mackie and McCartney, 1946]. Coliform test This test is carried out to estimate the degree of contamination present, a high degree of which renders the milk unsatisfactory for human consumption. The method described by Gaiger and Davis [1947] was adopted to carry out the test. Three tubes each containing 5 c.c. of McCartney broth culture medium were taken and 1 c.c. of 1/100 dilution of milk in sterile water was transferred into each of them. The culture tubes were incubated at 37°C. for 48 hours and then examined for acid and gas production, when two out of three tubes were found to be free from both acid and gas, the milk was regarded as satisfactory. Methylene blue reduction test This test is used in conjunction with Coliform test. The test was carried out according to the standard official method of England described by Mackie and McCartney [1946]. As methylene blue tablets were not available here methylene blue (methylthionin chloride) made by Boots Pure Drugs Co., Ltd., was used. A 1:20,000 solution of the dye was prepared and a part of this solution was heated to 100°C. for a few minutes before use. Two control tubes of milk one containing in addition 1 c.c. methylene blue solution and the other 1 c.c. of tap water were prepared, immersed in boiling water for 3 minutes and used for comparison. Cultural examination With a view to finding out the micro flora of milk samples marketed in big cities by actual identification of the individual species every milk sample was centrifuged and the centrifuge deposit was subjected to cultural examination. The cultures were made on nutrient agar and blood agar media in series for growing single Colonies and incubated at 37°C. under aerobic conditions only. Rapid Platform tests Alcohol test. This test detects the abnormal quantity of acid i.e., more than 0.21 per cent of calcium and magnesium. The method used was that recommen- ded by Eckles, Comb and Harold Macy [1943]. Ten c.c of 75 per cent alcohol and 10 c.c. of milk were taken together in a test tube which was inverted several times G2
116 RESEARCH INTO INDIAN CITY MILK [VOL. XX, PART II and observed for the production of coagulation or fine particles of curd, which denotes the abnormal nature of milk. Phenolphthalein test. This test is performed to note the abnormal percentage of lactic acid present in the milk as a result of the bacterial activity. The method adopted was that recommended by Eckles, Combs and Harold Macy [1943]. 17.6 gm. of milk were taken, 5 drops of 1 per cent alcoholic solution of phenolphthalein added to it and then N/10 sodium hydroxide solution was added to the same through a burette in drops until a persistent pink colour appeared. The percentage lactic acid was calculated according to the following formula. Percentage lactic acid = c.c. N/10 sodium hydroxide x 0.009 x 100/grammes of milk RESULTS The results of the chemical tests are given in Table I. The total count of viable bacteria and the classification of milk samples on the basis of bacterial count and dye reduction tests are given in the Table II. The results of Coliform tests and of rapid platform tests are given in the Table III. The classification of milk samples based on their chemical composition is given in the Table IV. The classification of milk samples based on their bacteriological quality is set out in the Table V. The results of the cultural examination carried out to study the flora of milk samples which were used in these experiments will be reported in a subsequent article as the work connected with it has not been completed, as yet. DISCUSSION It is observed from these findings that the standard plate count of milk samples, collected in Bombay city market, was not high according to the classification adopted in this study. All milk samples fell under Class I or 'good milk' and Class II or 'milk of a fair average quality' except about seven per cent of the samples. There were only 3 out of 40 samples which were classed as Class III or ' bad milk' and there were no 'very bad milk' samples classified either according to the plate count or the methylene blue reduction test. The average bacterial counts of milk from buffalo stables were 1,475,533 and that from milk vendors 1,368,800. Joshi [1916] has recorded in the city of Bombay an average plate count of 17,000,000 and 36,000,000 of bacteria per c.c. of milk from the city stables and milk vendors respectively. Our results do not, therefore, confirm Joshi's findings. Perhaps it may due to the fact that our investigation having been undertaken during winter. Our results are, however, in line with the findings recorded in Bangalore city by the Imperial Dairy Institute [1939]. The results on the composition of milk marketed in the Bombay city have yielded very interesting results. Milk rich in fat, high in total solids and normal in water contents, generally showed higher plate counts of bacteria per c.c. than those milk samples which were poor in fat and total solids and which contained more water

Further it may be observed that the milk from buffalo stables passing to the consumers direct or through the Government subsidised milk shop was the best and was in accordance with the average quality milk of buffalo except in water contents in about 50 per cent of samples. But the vendors' milk was in almost all instances very poor in all chemicals composition (Table I). It is common knowledge that in advanced nations, the quality control of milk is insisted upon all marketed milk and the easiest time saving method of estimating the extent of bacterial activity or contamination in the town where a laboratory is not available for carrying out bacterial count is methylene blue reduction test.

CHANGES IN FAT GLOBULES OF MILK ON SOURING By K. S. RANGAPPA AND B. N. BANERJEE, Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of science, Bangalore (Received for publication on 19 December 1949) (With three text-figures) THE size, distribution, electric charge, churning temperature and state of aggre- gation of fat globules in the churning medium (dahi or cream) are the principal factors determining the churnability and the yield of butterfat. (The role of dilu- tion of curd has already been studied in part V.) A study has been made in this paper of the changes in electrophoretic velocity and appearance of fat globules in milk on souring. CHANGES IN APPEARANCE OF FAT GLOBULES ON SOURING Experiment Boiled buffalo milk, was seeded as usual and soured. During souring, 1 c.c. of sample was drawn, made up to 25 c.c., carefully mixed and examined under the microscope. A micrometer eyepiece was fitted to the microscope to observe the size of the fat globules. The behaviour of fat globules of various sizes at different levels of acidity of curd was noted. The illustration, recorded with a camera lucida (Fig. 1), gives a picture of the changes on souring. The souring was conducted at room temperature (19°C.124 STUDIES ON THE METHOD OF PREPARATION OF GHEE [VOL.

The tendency of the large globules to coalesce, and even undergo distortion on staking, becomes very marked at this stage. On churning out the butter, almost all the fat globules remaining behind in the buttermilk are less than 3.3µ and are enmeshed in lumps of casein, and account, mostly, for the fat loss on churning. The same changes occur at both the temperatures of souring studied in the experiment. ELECTRIC CHARGE ON FAT GLOBULES The electric charge on the fat globules of milk and their iso-electric point have formed the subject of study by various workers. Thus Momsen [1929] found that the fat globules of milk carried a negative charge, and he located the iso-electric point at pH 4.1. Prieger [1930], however, found the iso-electric point to lie at pH 4.2. North and Sommer [1935] as well as Mohr and Brockmau [1930] found the iso-electric point to lie at pH 4.3. And it is to be noted that almost all the workers have used in their studies, acid and alkaline media or buffer solutions for changing the pH artificially, and only washed or unwashed milkfat, more or less free from the milk proteins. In the present experiments the electrophoresis of milkfat on souring has been recorded. Experiment Buffalo milk was soured as before, and the pH, acidity, and electrophoretic velocity were recorded at two temperatures (17°C.126 STUDIES ON THE METHOD OF PREPARATION OF GHEE [Vol. XX, PART II [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 2. PH-Mobility curve [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 3.June, 1950] K. RANGAPPA AND B. BANERJEE 127 DISCUSSION The table and the figures show that the iso-electric point of milkfat during souring of milk lies between pH 4.5 and 4.6, irrespective of the temperature of souring and the starter used. It must, however, be noted that the wide variations in the electrophoretic velocity of the individual particles at all stages, and the observation that even at pH 4.7 and 4.6 an increasing number of particles are elec- trically neutral, show that all particles are not neutralised simultaneously. When the acidity-mobility curve is considered, however, there appear appreciable differences in the acidity levels at the iso-electric point. With the pure culture of Lacto bacillus acidophilus and with one sample of mixed starter, the iso-electric point of the fat globules in dahi lies between 1.2 and 1.3 per cent lactic acid ; but with a different sample of mixed starter it lies between 1.5 and 1.6 per cent. In practice as the majority of fat globules are electrically neutral at pH 4.6 and 4.7, the maximum yield of butter may be obtained by churning the butter at about 1 per cent acidity.

BANERJEE 129 SUMMARY A study has been made in this paper of the changes in electrophoretic velocity and appearance of fat globules in milk on souring. As the acidity develops in soured milk the medium-sized fat globules first begin to coalesce. The larger globules then enter the clusters, leaving only the minute globules (less than 3.3µ free in the inter globular spaces. The shape of all the globules is retained to the last. But the tendency to adhere together and even undergo distortion increases with the rise in acidity. On churning the curd, practically all the globules above 3.3µ enter into butter. In the buttermilk only the very small globules, entrained in casein lumps, are to be seen. The changes that occur in the electrophoretic velocity of milk fat globules on souring milk with three different starters have been studied by using Mattson's microcatephoretic apparatus. The fat globules are found to become electrically neutral at a pH of 4.5 to 4.6, irrespective of the starter used and the temperature of souring. But the level of acidity of sour milk at which this occurs differs with the starterKEEPING QUALITY OF GHEE By NOSHIR N. DASTUR. A. RAHAMAN and N. B. SHROFF, Indian Dairy Researeh Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 13 May 1949) FRESH ghee should have no free fatty acids or rancidity. Presence of free fatty acids denotes that ghee has been prepared and stored under unfavourable conditions, e.g. use of raw milk, storage of curds unnecessarily long, storage of butter and kachha ghee, etc. [Srinivasan and Banerjee, 1946 ; Rangappa et al., 1946 Rangappa and Banerjee, 1946]. Rancidity in ghee denotes poor storage quality. Both these defects are thus associated with poor keeping quality of ghee. At present there is no legal safeguard against poor quality of ghee in most of the provinces. Only the Agmark and Army standards provide a limit for the maximum free fatty acids to be allowed. Large quantity of ghee usually sold in the market has con- siderable amount of free fatty acids. For rancidity no chemical standard has been prescribed but it has been suggested that ghee should not have a peroxide value of more than 5 ml. of N/500 thiosulphate per gm. of ghee (I.C.A.R. Misc. Bull., 64, 1946). Many of the common defects in ghee are attributed by persons in trade to such causes as feed given to animals. For example, the poor keeping quality of ghee produced in summer months is attributed to the feeding of old oil-cakes and unusual feeds, like the leaves of various trees. As high acidity in ghee is encountered so frequently experiments have been carried out to study the development of acidity in ghee produced under standard conditions, ghee produced by animals receiving special feed and ghee collected from different parts of the country. Side by side the development of rancidity in ghee has also been studied. EXPERIMENTAL For studying the keeping quality samples of ghee were stored in glass bottles with a small air gap and kept at 37° C. in an incubator. The samples were examined at intervals for acid value (per cent oleic) and peroxide value [Dastur and Lea, 1941]. Ghee samples prepared from the milk of animals receiving special feeds were also analyzed for their various chemical constants. The particulars of collection of various samples are described below : Farm produced ghee Milk was collected from Gir, Sahiwal, Sindhi, Tharparkar and Cross-bred cows and Dharwar and Murrah buffaloes maintained at the I.D.R.I. farm. Cream was separated and this churned into butter and the latter was melted into ghee. Ghee was prepared by two methods, viz. by gently heating the butter to a temperature not exceeding 120° C. and by warming butter to 60° C., allowing the aqueous portion to settle and then decanting off the clear fat. Keeping quality of samples pepared by both the methods, was studied over a period of over seven months. The results are shown in Table I. 131 K

For next eight weeks animals were given special feeds after necessary adjustments in their normal ration, and the last four weeks again served as the control period. Milk samples were collected from these animals at intervals, separated and con- verted into butter and ghee, as early as possible. The milk of two cows and two buffaloes receiving the same ration were mixed in equal quantities before separation. A part of the butter obtained was stored at room temperature for seven days and examined for flavour and texture. The feed of animals was arranged as follows : (a) Tender grass. When the experiment was started the dairy ration included 55 lb. of green grass per day in the case of cows and 70 lb. of green grass per day in the case of buffaloes. No change was made in the ration of the experimental animals but care was taken to see that the grass given was as tender as possible. The ration of each animal consisted of: Cows Buffaloes lb. lb. Ragi straw 3 3 Guinea grass 30 35 Rhodes grass 25 35 Concentrate mixture : 1 lb. for every 2 lb. of milk produced by the animal. The concentrate mixture consisted of wheat bran 4.0 parts, groundnut cake 2.5 parts, gram husks 2.0 parts and gram crushed 1.5 parts. (b) Neem, tamarind and mango leaves. These were fed at the rate of 10 lb. per animal per day. Neem and tamarind leaves were consumed by the animals readily. Mango leaves were first chaffed and then mixed with the roughage. The leaves replaced an equal quantity of green grass in the ration. (c) New and stored oil cakes. Three varieties of cakes were used, viz. groundnut- expeller, groundnut-ghanna and sesame-ghanna. These cakes were fed when just received and also after a storage for three months (after packing) in gunny bags. Cakes were fed at the rate of 5 lb. per day to each animal. To make the ration palatable, the above quantity of cake was mixed with 0.5 lb. of each of wheat bran, gram crushed and gram husk. This mixture was fed in place of the concentrate mixture described above. The quantity of green grass was also reduced to only 10 lb. per day and the ragi straw increased to 10 lb. The acid and peroxide values of samples of cakes stored for three months were respectively, sesame cake-ghanna, 46.5 and 6.0; ground nut cake-ghanna, 49.5 and 5.8 and groundnut cake-expeller, 15.4 and 4.6. As a rule ghanna cake contains two to three times more oil than expeller cake. The results of keeping quality of these samples are given in Tables II and III and will be discussed later. K 2

XX, PART II, Ghee samples collected from different centres in India Samples were obtained from ten centres. Special instructions were issued to parties concerned to purchase milk and prepare ghee as per instruction. Butter was not to be melted at a temperature exceeding 120°C. The ghee soon after pre- paration was to be packed in clean tins and despatched to Bangalore. Inspite of these instructions, it was found that ghee was sometimes over-heated and some of the tins were heavily rusted with the result that samples were already rancid when received at Bangalore. The results of such samples are not given here. The samples on arrival at Bangalore were heated at 60°C., filtered, transferred to glass bottles and stored at 37°C. The results of this study are given in Tables IV and V. For obvious reasons the names of parties who supplied the samples are not given but only the place of the origin of the sample is indicated. DISCUSSION (i) Farm produced ghee samples. The results of keeping quality of farm samples are given in Table I. These samples were prepared by the ordinary method taking no special precautions. Over a period of nearly seven months only ten samples out of 17 showed peroxide values exceeding 5.0, but in a majority of cases it was well below 2.0. These low peroxide values were recorded inspite of the fact that the samples were stored in clear glass bottles and they were therefore occassionally exposed to light during the course of analysis. That light is a very powerful catalyst for oxidation is now well established [Dastur and Banerjee, 1936 ; Lea, 1931]. The results also show that for preparing ghee of good quality high temperature is not necessary. Ghee prepared carefully either at 60°C. or 120°C. had equally good keeping quality. The data show that cow and buffalo ghee samples when properly made and stored with reasonable care keep good for a fairly long period. The figures for acidity reveal that all the samples had very low acid value. Similar results were obtained for both the first and second batch of ghee and to avoid repeti- tion, results for only the second batch are given, as in this series ghee was prepared from the same samples of butter at two temperatures. In no case was the acid value over 0.50 per cent oleic, a figure which is well below the stand for ' special quality ' Agmark ghee (1.5 per cent oleic). Method of preparation, or the breed of the animals had little effect on the development of acidity. Banerjee and co-workers (loc. cit.) have shown that the main causes of develop- ment of high acidity in ghee are the use of raw milk for preparing curds, long storage of curds and unwashed butter, and incomplete removal of moisture and associated impurities during the preparation of ghee. The data given confirm this conclusion. (ii) Effect of feeds on the keeping quality. That different types of feed effect the chemical composition of ghee has now been well established [Doctor et al., 1940 ; Anantakrishan et al., 1947]. As the object of the present study was to find out if different feeds affect the keeping quality of ghee, the data for composition are not given here. The keeping quality of butter as well as of the butter fat was studied. In appearance butter fat obtained from animals receiving cakes was much whiter in colour compared to samples from other animals. All the butter samples as soon as prepared were judged for texture and aroma by a panel of judges. They were then stored at room temperature for seven days and again judged. On storing for
June, 1950] N. DASTUR, A. RAHAMAN AND N. SHROFF 145 seven days there was a slight deterioration in flavour but a greater deterioration in texture. No difference was observed in the butter samples from control and ex- perimental animals. The results of keeping quality of the ghee samples are shown in Tables II and III. Keeping quality was studied over a period of five months. The data do not give any indication that the keeping quality of butter fat is adversely effected by any of the feeds given. Neem, tamarind and mango leaves are usually fed to animals during the dry season when there is a scarcity of fodder and the poor keeping quality of summer butter fat is sometimes attributed to these special feeds. There seems to be, however, no justification for such an assumption. In no case has the peroxide value exceeded 3.50 after five months' storage, and the acid value was well below 1.5 per cent oleic acid. It is also noteworthy that the oil in the cakes fed had very high acid value but this does not influence the quality of the secreted fat. (iii) Keeping quality of ghee obtained from different centres. Ghee samples were obtained from about ten centres. Though arrangements were made with the local authorities to prepare the ghee by the standard method supplied, evidence shows that the effect of oxidation on the keeping quality of ghee was not understood by many [cf. Dastur, 1947]. Many of the samples when received had high peroxide values, which could be due to contact with light, or air or metals. The results for samples whose peroxide value was much above five are not given here as these samples were already rancid. The results in Table V show that the rate of develop- ment of rancidity varies widely even in samples received from the same centre. Assuming that the maximum peroxide value that can be allowed in ghee samples is 5.0, the keeping quality of ghee samples, taking maximum period of storage as 220 days, works out as follows: Bangalore 214 days Charodi . 124 days Hosur . 190 days Junagadh . 97 days Delhi . 158 days Guntur 85 days The acid value of these sample is showing in Table IV. These were studied for nearly a year. The maximum acid value noted in one. instance was 3.93, but in large majority of the samples the values were below 2.0 per cent oleic. Studies on breed, feed, and seasonal variation point the fact that ghee prepared with proper care can be stored satisfactorily. High acid ghee (exceeding 2.0 per cent oleic) need not be sold for public consumption. It is only by insisting on a high quality standard that the general quality of the market ghee can possibly be improved. SUMMARY Ghee samples prepared on the farm from the milk of different breeds of animals had good keeping quality. Acidity did not exceed 0.50 per cent oleic even after seven months storage, and the average keeping quality as judged by the peroxide values was well over seven months. The effect of feeding tender grass ; neem, tamarind and mango leaves ; and oil cakes, on the keeping quality of the butter fat secreted were studied. These feed do not seem to influence the keeping quality of ghee in any way.
146 KEEPING QUALITY OF GHEE [VOL. XX, PART II, The effect of feeding stored oil cakes was also investigated. Though the oil in such cakes had very high acid value, the butter fat obtained from animals receiving such cakes in their diet had low acid value and good keeping quality. The keeping quality of ghee samples collected from different centres was studied. All the samples studied did not develop high acidity even after storage of one year. The rate of peroxide development varied considerably. From the results obtained it is stressed that the proper method for the manufacture and storage of ghee are of much greater importance in obtaining ghee of good keeping quality than such factors as breed of animals or feed.

ABSTRACTS Comparative Growth Promoting Values of the Proteins of Cereal Grains. Jones, D.B., CALDWELL, A., and WIDNESS, K. D. (1948). J. Nutrit., 35, 639-649 THE growth promoting values of the proteins of rolled oats, hard wheat, soft wheat, rye, yellow corn, pearled barley, brown and polished rice were compared by means of ad libitum feeding experiments with rats, extending over a period of six weeks. The test substances formed the sole source of protein in the diets, which were made nutritionally adequate with respect to factors other than protein. The experimental materials were incorporated to supply protein at 4.5, 7.5, 9.5 and 12 per cent levels in the diet. The N contents of the substances permitted a comparision of all the eight at 4.5 per cent level, whereas at 7.5, 9.5, and 12 per cent levels, only the first seven, four and two respectively, could be compared. The average increase in weight of each group of animals and the average gain in weight per gram of protein consumed were used as standards of comparison for evaluating the proteins. At the 4.5 per cent protein level oats was closely followed in descending order, by rye, polished rice, brown rice, soft wheat, pearled barley, hard wheat and yellow corn148 ABSTRACTS [Vol. XX, No. II or substances from the sperms.

(S.G.) A Preliminary Study of the Toxicity of Calotropis gigantea. Rathnasabapathy V. el al. (1949). Indian J. med. Res. (4) CALOTEOPIS GIGANTEA (Asclepiadaceae) is a reputed medicinal plant in the indigenous literature and it has been reported to be toxic to animals. Feeding experiments indicate that the leaf powder is non-toxic to ruminants, in doses that would prove toxic to canines, owing to the complexity of the stomach of the former. On the other hand, it exerts a tonic effects on the ruminants. The active principle, obtained from the leaves and the latex of the plant, produces a sustained stimulating action on the circulation, by directly acting on the musculature of the heart and blood vessels. It increases the irritability of the heart, decreases the latent period and shortens the refractory period. Further it has got the power of resuscitation of failing hearts. It is a good ecbolic also, due to the direct action on the musculature of the uterus. Since it acts as a good cardiac stimulant, further work is being pursued to determine the chemical constitution, stability and the possibilities of the therapeutic application of the drug. (R.V.) The Influence of the Ration and Early Rumen Development on the Changes in the Plasma Carotenoids, Vitamin A and Ascorbic Acid of Young Diary Calves, HIBBS, J. W. and POUNDEN, W. D. J. Dairy Sci., 31 (12) AS it is recognized that the period between the birth of a calf and the time it takes to develop into a normally functioning ruminant is critical, from the stand point of nutritional well being and health, the authors have undertaken the study of the influence of the ration and early rumen development on the changes occurring in the plasma carotenoids, vitamin A and ascorbic acid of dairy calves during this early postnatal development. After feeding colostrum for three days, all the calves were fed whole milk for six weeks at the rate of 0.9 lb. per 10 lb. body weight. This low level of milk feeding was adopted so as to encourage the calves to consume more of the dry feeds. They got whole milk and various dry feeds with and without rumen inoculations. There were six groups on the whole. All calves were bled on the 4th and 7th days of the age and weekly thereafter until the 42nd day of age. Till the 42nd day of age plasma carotenoids vitamin A and ascorbic acid were determined. The results of the work show that the drop in blood plasma and ascorbic acid was prevented due to inoculations when only alfalfa hay and milk were fed ; but the effect was adverse when grain was included in the ration. The carotenoid levels increased considerably after addition of whole milk and alfalfa hay, than after the inclusion of grain. No
June, 1950] ABSTRACTS 149 marked changes were, however, noticed on the blood plasma vitamin A after rumen inoculation. When grain was introduced in the ration of calves fed with alfalfa hay and milk, there was marked reduction in hay consumption. There was an increase in plasma vitamin A, but a decrease in ascorbic acid during that period. These results show that palatable and high quality hay stimulates the early development of rumen function in young calves and also meets the vitamin require- ments of animals. (P.N.J.) MGIPCORIGINAL ARTICLES COMPARATIVE GROWTH PROMOTING VALUE OF OILS AND FATS By V. R. BHALERAO, D. VENKATAPPIAH and C. P. ANANTAKRISHNAN, Indian Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 1 June, 1948) (with two text-figures) OILS and fats form an important constituent of the human diet. In different parts of the country, however, people have acquired a taste for different fats, though butterfat being generally preferred. But on account of its high cost and scarcity, other fats specially of vegetable origin are used as substitutes, either in their original form or after conversion into a semi-solid mass by hydrogenation. Vegetable fats and body fats are of course, lacking in vitamins A and D which are present in butterfat. It will be useful to know if, even after supplementation with vitamins, the vegetable fats and body fats show any difference in nutritive value from butterfat. Considerable work has been done on the nutritive value of various fats in different laboratories, but there is, at present, no complete agreement as regards the results of their comparative growth promoting values. Using vitamin supplements Boutwell et al. [1941, 1943] have carried out a series of experiments on the growth promoting values of different fats and have come to the conclusion that butterfat promoted better growth in rats than did vegetable fats. This effect was pronounced when lactose formed the sole carbo- hydrate in the diet, the difference, however, disappeared when the lactose was replaced by any other carbohydrate or a mixture of carbohydrates. Hoagland and Snider [1940, 1941, 1942] carried out experiments with rats to determine the nutritive properties of vegetable oils, animal fats and manufactured shortenings. The average growth values of different fats were found to be almost similar in the presence of vitamins. They further stated that there was no relationship between the melting point or chemical composition of a fat and its nutritive properties. Deuel et al. [1943, 1944] found no difference in the growth rates of rats fed on butter- fat, vegetable margarine fat, maize, cottonseed, soyabean, olive or peanut oils, when added, to the extent of 32 per cent, to a diet of mineralized skim milk powder and supplemented with vitamins. Zialcita and Mitchell [1944] have observed that apart from the differences in the vitamin content, butterfat and corn oil were essentially equal in growth promoting values. Haris and Rosenfield [1940] in their experiments on feeding rats found that butterfat promoted better growth, than olive oil or coconut oil, in diets containing extracted skim milk powder supplemented by minerals and vitamins. Bour and Janson [1941] described experiments in which butter, fatty acids of butter, olive oil and margarine were fed at 10 per cent level (151) A
152 GROWTH PROMOTING VALUE OF OILS AND FATS [Vol. XX, Part III in synthetic diets, wherein they found that the rats on butter and fatty acids of butter grew better. Euler et al. [1942] proved that in presence of vitamins lard was superior to butterfat in growth promoting properties. Recently Henry et al. [1945], compared the growth promoting properties of butterfat, margarine and other vegetable oils in skim milk and in dry basal diet, and, concluded that there were practically no differences in the different fats, so far as their nutritive properties were concerned. Basu and Nath [1946] also compared the nutritive values of different fats and oils and observed a better growth with butterfat than with the other fats. Thus, it is seen that no definite conclusion has been reached with regard to growth promoting values of different fats. It was, therefore, thought of interest to study the comparative growth rate of rats on various fats and oils and the results of the experiment are reported in this paper. A study was also made on the nutritive value of vanaspati (hydrogenated oils) over second and third generations of the rats. Collection of the fats used for the experiment Samples of genuine ghee from eight different breeds of cattle, viz. Sindhi, Kangayam, Ongole, Gir, Kankrej, Sahiwal, Hariana and Murrah buffaloes were collected from the dairy farms at Housur, Madras, Charrodi, Karnal, Hissar, Montgomery (now in Pakistan), Delhi and Bangalore through their respective officers. Goat ghee was collected from the farms at Hissar, Agra, Trichur, Anand, Chikkodi and sheep ghee from Montgomery (now in Pakistan), Anand, Sanand and Togh (Kohat now in Pakistan). The sample of vegetable oils and body fats were obtained from Madras, Bangalore, Allahabad, Calcutta, Kanpur and Lahore and Karachi (now in Pakistan) through the Agricultural Marketing Adviser to the Government of India. The hydrogenated edible oils from groundnut, cottonseed and sesame were obtained through the Vanaspati Manufacturers Association, Bombay. All the fats and oils were stored at a temperature of about 45°September, 1950] BHALERAO, VENKATAPPIAH AND ANANTAKRISHNAN 153 Batch I Batch II 1 Cow ghee 1 Cow ghee 2 Buffalo ghee 2 Goat ghee 3 Cow body fat 3 Sheep ghee 4 Buffalo body fat 4 Mustard oil 5 Sheep body fat 5 Cottonseed oil 6 Goat body fat 6 Groundnut V. m.p. 39.0°C. 7 Groundnut oil 7 Sesame V. m.p. 39.3°C. 8 Sesame oil 8 Sesame V. m.p. 37.1°C. 9 Safflower oil 9 Cottonseed V. m.p. 37.3°C. 10 Coconut oil 10 Cottonseed V. m.p. 35.5°C. 11 Groundnut V. m.p. 37.0°C. 12 Groundnut V. m.p. 34.1°C. 13 Cottonseed V. m.p. 38.5°C. 14 Sesame V. m.p. 38.7C. V. Refers to vanaspati in all cases To study the growth promoting value, young albino rats about 28 days old (6 female and 4 male rats) were used. Rats from different litters were distributed as evenly as possible among the groups receiving different fats. The diet consisted of skim milk powder 57 per cent, and cane sugar 30 per cent, yeast 5 per cent, salt mixture (Osborne and Mendel) 3 per cent each and fat 5 per cent. The skim milk powder (Acorn Brand) contained about 0.30 per cent ether extractives and was, therefore, extracted twice with cold low boiling petroleum ether. Subsequently the milk powder obtained contained only minute amounts of ether extractives, so further extractions were not done. Yeast was extracted by soxhleting for 12 hours with petroleum ether. The average increase in weight, at the end of 48 days of the experiment, was studied and was taken as an index of the growth promoting activities of the various fats. To study the effect on maintenance, reproduction and lactation, the rats were further maintained on a less liberal basal ration consisting of ground wheat 18 per cent and ground maize 52 per cent, skim milk powder 23 per cent each and yeast 2 per cent each. The diets were supplied with the same fats at 5 per cent level. In addition to the m aize diet, each rat received 5 gm. of fresh green consisting of carrots and cabbage. Each rat was supplied with about 5 gm. of the diet in the beginning, which was slowly increased to 10 gm. taking care as far as possible that not much diet was left on the next day. The weights of the animals were recorded every fourth day throughout the experiment. When the animals were 4 months old, the females of each group were mated with males of the same group. The number of live young ones born was recorded as an index of reproduction capacity and the number of young ones alive at weaning time to represent the ability of the mother to rear her offsprings.
154 GROWTH PROMOTING VALUE OF OILS AND FATS [Vol. XX, Part II In order to study the effect of continuous feeding of vanaspati, the experiments were continued over second and third generations using groundnut vanaspati m.p. 37.1°C. and 39.0°C., sesame vanaspati m.p. 37.1°C. and 38.7°C., and cottonseed vanaspati m.p. 37.3°C. and 38.5°C. following the same technique. The rats in the second generation were fed the diets their mothers were receiving, viz. the different fats at 5.0 per cent level. The growth rate was compared after 48 days of the experiment and at maturity, i.e. after 4 months, the male and female rats of the same group were mated. The third generation of rats obtained was treated in the same way as in the second generation. The gain in weight made by the female and male rats, at the end of 48 days of the experimental period, is shown in Fig. 1 for the first generation and in Fig. 2 for the second and third generations.

This is true not only in the first generation but also in second and third generations in case of vanaspati groups. DISCUSSION Though some fats induced poor growth in female rats, they were found to be quite adequate for growth in male rats. It is seen from the results that none of the fats induced poor growth in male and female rats consistently throughout the 3 generations. If all the results are compiled together, it can be said in general that there are practically no differences in the growth promoting values of different fats when fed to rats at 5 per cent level in synthetic diet adequately supplied with vitamins A and B complex. Contrary to the findings of Basu and Nath [1946], mustard oil and coconut oil induced better growth in rats. This might be due to the nature of the carbohydrate used which was starch in their experiments while we had used a mixture of cane sugar and skim milk powder. The differences in the gains in weight caused by different fats were so small that they do not confirm the findings of Wisconsin workers (loc. cit.) and Basu and Nath (loc. cit.), who have indicated that butterfat is superior to other fats in promoting growth in young rats with diets adequate with regard to vitamins and minerals. The Wisconsin workers have attributed the superiority of butterfat to the existence of higher saturated components in it. They have also stated that the differences are manifest when lactose was the sole carbohydrate used and disappeared when it was replaced by other carbohydrates. We have, however, used a mixture of carbohydrates in the diets. No attempt was made by us to separate the butterfat into saturated and unsaturated glycerides to study their respective growth promoting properties. Our results agree closely with those of Henry et. al. (loc. cit.) wherein they have stated that the various oils and fats are as efficient as butterfat in their nutritive properties. Hydrogenation, to the extent carried out in our samples, does not seem to affect the nutritive properties of oils. Out of nine vanaspatis examined for growth rate, only two vanaspatis from cottonseed oil induced poor growth only in females. But in subsequent generations the growth of female rats on vanaspatis compared favourably well with that on cow ghee. The various fats were found to be adequate for fertility both in male and female rats as indicated by the fact that more than 94 per cent of the females cast litters. From the standpoint of lactation, as judged by the survival of the young ones and their weight at weaning time, the different fats were found to be equally effective and vanaspatis in no way were inferior to cow ghee. Three consecutive generations were, moreover, successfully reared on diets containing 5 per cent of vanaspati supplemented with vitamins. It can, thus, be concluded that with an adequate vitamin supplement, the fats studied were of equal nutritive value for growth and reproduction.

There were practically no differences in the growth promoting values of different fats when fed to the rats at a 5 per cent level in diets otherwise adequate for growth. There were also no differences in the reproduction capability and the lactating power of the females on different fatty diets. No differences were found in the growth rate and the reproduction capability of the rats on different vanaspatis of melting points between 37.0°C. and 39.0°C. when the growth experiments were continued over second and third generations.

EFFECT OF CUTTING AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF GROWTH By B. P. SRIVASTAVA, S. K. MUKERJI AND J. G. SHRIKHANDE, Chemistry Section, Agricultural College, Kanpur ( Received for publication on 20 December 1949 ) ( With five text-figures) REGULAR fodder supply in the green and succulent state throughout the year is an important problem in dairying in India. It is difficult in this country to maintain a green crop continuously due to drastic seasonal variations and long period of draught except during the rains. Since India is too poor to maintain pastures on artificial fertilizers and irrigation, leguminous crops are given first consideration. Although legumes like senji and saftal grow wild in our lands, they can not be seriously considered because of their low yields and bad seeding habits. Lucerne and berseem were attempted as substitutes but berseem was preferred because of its adaptability to local conditions producing fairly satisfactory yields. In the United Provinces berseem has been found to withstand a certain degree of salinity and it also grows well in the late paddy areas during winter. As the area under berseem cultivation increased with the desire to preserve it as silage also, the question of its nutritive value at different stages of cut arose. This communication deals with this aspect of the problem. Several investigators have recorded the composition of grasses and legumes at various stages of growth. Newlander, Jones and Ellenberger [1933] observed a decrease in their protein and an increase in their fibre contents with maturity. Iyer [1935] observed a decrease in the crude protein and soluble ash with maturity of certain grasses. Lander [1937] noted a decrease in nutrients with the maturity of grasses which was subsequently confirmed by Fraps and Fudge [1940]. Das Gupta [1942] made a preliminary study of the composition of berseem as affected by maturity. Dharmani [1945] found a decrease in the nutritive value of berseem with the increase in the cutting interval. These workers have indicated only the period when the herbage gave the maximum nutritive value after sowing. In this investigation berseem was harvested at weekly intervals during the entire life process of the plant up to pod formation and the yield and composition were determined from an experiment laid out statistically. EXPERIMENTAL Berseem was sown on the 11th and on the 15th October 1946 and 1947 respectively after jowar (Sorghum vulgare). The experiment was randomized with four treatments ( 169 ) D
170 NUTRITIVE VALUE OF BERSEEM [Vol. XX, Part III and eight replications. The blocks were also fixed at random. The plot was over an acre and the sub-plot area was one-fortieth of an acre. The length of each sub-plot was about twice its breadth. Sampling was done according to the method adopted by Walrath [1948]. Care was taken to avoid sampling of the same plot twice. The following were the treatments : Treatment A. After sowing the plants were allowed to mature and samples were taken at weekly intervals to determine yield and composition. Treatment B. Only one cut was taken and the regular sampling was continued till maturity. Treatment C. Two cuts were taken and the samples were then regularly obtained. Treatment D. Three cuts were taken before sampling of berseem. OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS The green matter yield from each sub-plot was carefully recorded. Fig. 1 represents the average of eight yields. The material was then dried at 100°C. and powdered to pass through 1 mm. sieve ; this was preserved for subsequent analysis. The following determinations were made on these samples :September, 1950] SRIVASTAVA, MUKERJI AND SHRIKHANDE 171 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 1.

174 NUTRITIVE VALUE OF BERSEEM [Vol. XX, Part III A composite sample for all the eight replications was submitted to chemical and enzymatic analysis. Figs. 2a and 2b represent the percentage composition and yield in kilogram per acre of crude protein, crude fibre and ether extract. It will be observed that the protein decreased with maturity. The decrease was very rapid in the beginning and then slowed down. The decrease was proportional to the rate of growth in the early stage but later though the growth rate was appre- ciable, the protein content did not go down. This resulted in a slightly higher pro- tein yield per acre in the later stages of growth. The date fixed for taking subsequent cuts therefore had to take into consideration other components. Ether extract decreased throughout the life of the plant in all the cuts. When the yield of ether extract per acre is considered we see the following differences :September, 1950] SRIVASTAVA, MUKERJI AND SHRIKHANDE 175 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 3a.

September, 1950] SRIVASTAVA, MUKERJI AND SHRIKHANDE 179 Figs. 4 and 5 represent the percentage composition of the plant and the yield of the mineral constituents per acre. Since berseem supplies large amounts of potassium to animals, potassium was estimated to study its effect upon nutrition ; this would also indicate to a certain extent the uptake of potassium by the berseem from the soil. With the increase, due to photosynthesis, in the dry matter of the plant with maturity, there is a proportionate decrease in its mineral content. The absorption of minerals and silica by the plant however continues upto maturity. Absorption is greatest when plant is making rapid growth either after germination or during the period of tillering after cuts. The magnesium, phosphorus and potash content of the plant decreased with maturity. After each cut there is a rapid absorption of these minerals from the soil and the new tillers contain more or less the same amount as after germination, absorption being greater in the early growth. The dates of cut decided upon the basis of organic constituents also served to give valuable information about minerals. The calcium content of berseem however increased with age and then fell very slowly towards maturity. The absorption of calcium by berseem as shown in Fig. 4 indicates an increased uptake in the beginning. It will be interesting to note that the curves representing the composition of berseem for phosphorus and calcium appear to be so to say mirror images suggesting some relationship between the absorption of the two elements, from the soil. Calcium percentage in the plant increased, whereas the phosphoric acid content decreased with maturity. They appear to be correlated negatively. DISCUSSION Berseem is grown in this province for green fodder and for ensilage. The different cuts have therefore to be planned keeping in view the yield and nutrient values. Palatability is another factor to be considered. Berseem with more than 20 per cent dry matter, i.e., less than 80 per cent succulence becomes unpalatable. The dry matter percentage ranged from 17 to 20 between the 9th and 11th week after sowing. The digestible protein content at this stage was 17.6 per cent with the maximum yield. This applies equally to ether extract and calcium. The crop at this stage contained nutrients admirably suited for milch and growing animals. Calcium and phosphoric acid content was sufficient to meet the requirement for rapid milk and bone formation. Both the calcium-phosphoric acid and calcium-magnesium ratios were proper for a biological balance. Potash content was 2 per cent, the optimum above which it may cause digestive disturbances. From a joint consideration of all these factors it appears that berseem should be harvested within a fortnight after two months of sowing. Care should however be taken that in combination with other feeds no other material causing laxative action is included in the ration and that not more than 50 to 75 per cent of berseem is fed as a protein supplement. For a growing animal the lower figure is safer. After the first cut fresh tillers appeared. They made rapid growth. The dry matter content went up gradually with maturity and reached 19 per cent at the end F
180 NUTRITIVE VALUE OF BERSEEM [Vol. XX, Part III of two months. The protein content was 18 per cent of which 61 per cent was digesti- ble. Though this was lower than that obtained before the first cut was taken ; this value is suitable for different productive purposes. Out of 9 per cent minerals 2 per cent was potash, which indicated proper salt concentration in the feed. CaO : P2O5 was 8 : 1 suggesting a low phosphorus content and calls for an additional supplement of phosphoric acid. Calcium-magnesium ratio was normal. The ether extract yield per acre was optimum. The fibre was not too high after the first cut. Harvesting after one cut ensures maximum nutrient removal coinciding with nutrients in an almost balanced state. At this stage berseem could be fed green or preserved as silage. It may also be cured as hay to be used as a protein supplement to replace a part of the concentrate ration. The second harvest of berseem after seven weeks from the first cut gave another series of tillers ; this tillering occurring in spring possessed greater moisture content than the original crop. The dry matter per cent was 13 per cent only. In order to raise the yield of nutrients per acre berseem was allowed to grow at a less rapid rate, till the cessation of further growth when dry matter reached a level of 20 per cent. Protein after the second cut was 17.33 per cent which provided digestible protein to the extent of 66 per cent ; the second cut thus yielded more digestible protein per acre than the first cut. Ether extract per acre was lower. Fibre and total carbohy- drates were higher than after the first cut. Out of 10 per cent minerals calcium oxide was 3.36 per cent, and phosphoric acid was only 0.3 per cent. The calcium phosphoric acid ratio being 11.2 calls for an addition of phosphates to balance the ration. Potash was 1.3 and magnesium 0.56 per cent. From these considerations it appears that the next harvesting of berseem should be done after six weeks of the previous cut. Because of the rise in temperature and flowering of the plants due to hot weather, succulence decreased dry matter being 19 per cent and 27.6 per cent at the end of fourth and sixth weeks. The growth beyond this stage slowed down. Yield of nutrients however at this stage was proportionately high due to low moisture content in the plant after giving three cuts. Due to maturation process digestible protein went down with a corresponding increase in fibre. This apparen- tly decreased the food value of berseem. The final harvesting was meant for straw making. The product is similar to coarse fodders and is not suitable for silage or partial substitute for concentrates. Calves and milch cattle may not be fed on this. Dry cows and draught bullocks which have greater power for utilising coarse fodders may be given this as a roughage. SUMMARY The feeding value of berseem at different stages of cuts was obtained by chemical means. The yield of green berseem per acre increased with growth after sowing as well as after each cut. The succulence decreased and the yield of dry matter increased after sowing and each cut improved succulence and out turn per acre.
September, 1950] SRIVASTAVA, MUKERJI AND SHRIKHANDE 181 Crude protein, digestibility and ether extract decreased on growth after sowing. Cuts gave rise to tillers which improved the nutrient status. Crude fibre and total carbohydrates increased. There was decrease in potash and phosphoric acid whereas calcium content increased with growth up to the flowering stage. First cut is recommended within first fortnight following two months of sowing when the yield of green herbage and dry matter was 2892 kg. and 532 kg. respectively. Digestibility of protein was 81 per cent, CaO : P2O5 was 5 : 1, and CaO : MgO was 6 : 1. Second cut is recommended after two months of the first cut when the yield of green berseem and dry matter were 3232 kg. and 630 kg. respectively with a succul- ence of 80.5 per cent. Digestibility of protein was 62 per cent, CaO : P2O5 was 8 : 1 and CaO : MgO was 8 : 1. Third cut is recommended after one and a half months of second cut when the yield of green berseem was 3671 kg. and dry matter 740 kg. with a succulence of 80 per cent. Digestibility of protein was 67 per cent and CaO : P2O5 was 10 : 1 requiring an extra supply of P2O5 in the feed ; CaO : MgO was 6 : 1. Final harvesting may be done four weeks after the third cut. Feed at this stage was coarse and suitable for working bullocks and dry cattle as roughage. REFERENCES Das Gupta, N. C. (1942). Indian J. vet.

THE NUTRITIVE VALUE OF THE INDIGENOUS GRASSES OF ASSAM II. THE ACID PRODUCING PASTURE GRASS ULU (IMPERATA ARUNDINACEA, CYRILL) AS A CATTLE FEED BY S. K. TALAPATRA, PH.D., U. P. College of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry, Mathura ( Received for publication on 20 February 1948) AS is well-known, herbivora urine is normally slightly alkaline. Under certain conditions of feeding, however, urine tends to become acidic. Iyer, Ayyar and Dasgupta [1935] in their studies on the influence of progressive ripening of fodders on the mineral nutrition of cattle observed that with progressive maturity urine became less and less alkaline till it definitely turned acidic with a number of fodders. These authors, however, remarked that the excretion of the mineral calcium in urine was definitely related to the acid base equilibrium, the higher the alkalinity, the lower was the urinary calcium and that the serum calcium was closely related to urinary clacium ; with each fodder an increase of urinary calcium was paralleled by a corresponding increase of serum calcium. They finally came to the conclusion that serum calcium showed an increase as the crop advanced in maturity and was not dependent either on the intake or the balance of calcium. Again the feeding of some stuffs like paddy straw and Napier grass, which usually contain large quantities of potassium in combination with oxalic acid, produces in the animal body an extreme form of alkalinity followed by severe diuresis as observed by Talapatra et al [1942] and Sen, Roy and Talapatra [1942]. The results obtained by Iyer, Ayyar and Dasgupta is in consonance with the observation [Talapatra et al (loc cit.)]. that the potassium salt of the organic acid, which appears to be responsible for excessive alkalinity in most of these feeding stuffs, decreases as the plant matures. However, from the available data it appears that reduced alkalinity or slight acidity may be normally expected by feeding fodders at their ripe stages and there seems to be little or no reference in the literature on the effect of feeding grasses which normally induce acidic urine even when fed at their early stage. With a view to ascertain the causes responsible for the poor productive activi- ties of cattle in Assam, we have recently undertaken a very detailed survey of the pasture grasses on which practically thrives the entire cattle population. During the course of our survey, it has been observed that the feeding of the pasture grass ulu (Imperata arundinacea, Cyrill), which is predominant in almost all the grazing areas of the province, leads to acidic urine regardless of the stage at which it is fed to cattle. ( 183 ) G
184 NUTRITIVE VALUE OF THE INDIGENOUS GRASSES OF ASSAM [Vol. XX, Part III Cattle are seldom stall-fed in Assam. It has therefore, been considered desirable to study the sum total effect of feeding a grass of this nature on the animal system at various stages of life. Hence adult and rapidly growing animals were taken as experimental subjects. The metabolism of the organic and inorganic nutrients under various conditions of feeding has been separately reported in the present paper which gives an account of these investigations in two parts as follows : I. The chemical composition of the grass from the various pastures of the province at two stages of growth and the metabolism of the organic nutrients as affected by feeding the same to adult and young animals under a variety of conditions. II. The metabolism of the inorganic nutrients calcium and phosphorus with and without the supplementation of calcium salts under various conditions of feed- ing. Ulu is a sweet smelling highland grass, grows abundantly in acid soil and is available in considerable quantities in the hills and plains of the province. Accord- ing to the forest authorities so plentiful is the supply of the grass that the roughage quota of the entire cattle population can be met with if properly mobilised. It is difficult to eradicate once it gets set and is therefore, considered as a pest. In this respect, it behaves like kans (Saccharum spontanium) but is very much softer to the feel than either kans or Bhara (Saccharum munj). During the early growth it is usually associated with many other grasses, but very soon it destroys other natural flora and dominates so firmly that grazing of any description can not either destroy or check its vegetative growth. It grows to a height of about one and a half to two feet. It is extremely drought resistant, when the old ones are burnt down during the months of February and March, within a fortnight new shootings spring up. This process some times saves our cattle from starvation, as the grazing areas are practically barren at this period of the year. A little nitrogenous or farmyard manure makes the leaf broader and under such treatments the grass assumes a deep green colour. When frequently cut and new growth allowed, the grass becomes soft and is much relished by cattle. I. The chemical composition and the metabolism of the organic nutrients under various conditions of ulu feeding The chemical composition of the grass collected from the various pastures of the province at different stages of growth viz., young and prime, representing the early and late monsoon cut is shown in Table I, while the detailed analysis is given in Table II. The data shown in the above table are the mean of a number of samples from the various representative tracts. It is obvious from the composition that the grass is not rich in any of the indispensable nutrients, the content of protein is barely sufficient for maintenance. The detailed composition is shown in Table II. It may be seen from the data in Table II that the grass is conspicuously low in ash at all stages of growth and hence rich in organic matter. The dry matter of the grass usually varies between 25 to 50 per cent. The other nutrients are not very much different from those shown in Table I. The samples may, therefore,

186 NUTRITIVE VALUE OF THE INDIGENOUS GRASSES OF ASSAM [Vol. XX, Part III be taken as representatives of the province and hence any results obtained by feed- ing these will in general be applicable in the formulation of practical ration anywhere in the province. The data shown in Tables I and II further show that at the early stage, the grass is moderately rich in the essential nutrients, which may be regarded as a fairly adequate one for maintenance. At the prime stage, however, when the yield is quite considerable, it is hardly a maintenance ration. The content of phosphorus seems to be very low. Adult animals as experimental subjects Six adult bullocks (local Assamese) of about 400 lb. body-weight were taken for the metabolism experiments. They were fed for a sufficiently long period with the grass at the prime stage ad lib along with a concentrate mixture consisting of one pound of rice bran and 0.5 lb. of oil-cake. The animals voided on an average of about 1.5 litres of urine which was definitely acidic in that the fresh urine turned blue litmus red at once. When sulphuric acid was added to a large volume of urine, no trace of carbon dioxide could be obserevd. The faeces, however, was not so soft as is ordinarily observed under any green feeding. In fact, the feeding of the grass seemed to correct the looseness of the bowels. The animals were kept on this feed for about two months without any evil effect. At the end of this period, they were divided into two groups, three in each. One group was allowed to continue on the same ration, while one ounce of wood-ash was added in the ration fo each animal in the other group. This means that both the group were virtually kept on the same ration. The object of adding wood-ash was to counteract a mild form of acidosis and to bring about normal condition in the animial system. As per expecta- tion, the administration of wood-ash had the desired effect, the animals began to pass alkaline urine, while those without it continued to void acidic urine. At the end of three weeks of feeding wood-ash, a metabolism experiment was conducted to determine the comparative efficiency of utilisation of the organic nutrients of the grass under the two sets of feeding. The dry matter consumption and the digestibility co-efficients under the two sets of feeding are shown in Table III. TABLE III Dry matter consumption of animals Animal number Body- weight lb.

September, 1950] S. K. TALAPATRA 187 The data in the above table indicate that the acid-producing property of the grass had little effect on the consumption of the dry matter. The administration of wood-ash in the diet to bring about normal alkaline condition had little effect except that the animals in the wood-ash group consumed on an average about 10 per cent more of the dry matter.

188 NUTRITIVE VALUE OF THE INDIGENOUS GRASSES OF ASSAM [Vol. XX, Part III The nitrogen balance is definitely positive and there is hardly any difference in the faecal and urinary excretion under the two sets of feeding. The grass ulu at the worst green stage It has already been shown that the feeding of the grass at the prime stage along with a concentrate mixture is not likely to do any harm. However, in spite of all these evidences, it was decided to bring about an extreme condition by feeding the grass at the worst stage (October and November cut), the concentrate supplement was also withdrawn. The same animals were taken as experimental subjects. They were fed exclusively on this grass for about two months. The grass is consumed at this stage at the rate of 1.6 lb. per 100 lb. body-weight. The digestibility co- efficients are shown in Table VI. It may be seen from the data that all the animals showed regularity in digestion and nothing abnormal was noticed.

The S. E. (Kellner's) and D. P. have been found to be 15.6 and 0.44 lb. respectively per 100 lb. of the raw material. The crude fibre digestibility of the grass was high when it was fed as a single feed. It is rather interesting to note that the fibre digestibility was lowered when fed with a concentrate mixture as shown in Table VII. The above data will show that in the absence of a miantenance ration, our animals made a desperate effort to utilise as much of the carbohydrate from the rass as possible. The nitrogen balances of the animals under ulu as a single feed are shown in Table VIII. As expected all the animals showed a high negative balance.

The late or the prime ulu was replaced by the early cut one, as the young calves did not seem to relish very much the mature grass. This ration was fed for a period of two months and at the end of which metabolism experiments were conducted to ascertain the digestibility co-efficients. The young animals continued to pass urine which was slightly acidic to litmus right from the fourth day of feeding the grass. No abnormality, however, was noticed even after feeding for more than two months. When the experiment on the basic ulu diet was over, the animals were fed 20 gm. of precipitated calcium carbonate prepared in this laboratory. The feeding of calciun carbonate brought about some change in the animal system, the urine was alkaline. The animals were kept on this diet for a period of about one month, at the end of which, a metabolism experiment was conducted to test the comparative efficiency of the two sets of feeding. The organic nutriants digested under the two sets of feeding are shown in Table IX.

On an average intake of about 240 gm. or 0.53 lb. of digestible protein, the animals gained on an average about 51 lb. in 59 days on a basal ration of ulu plus concentrate mixture. This normal growth apparently indicates that the acidic ulu ration had no detrimental effect on the general health of the calves. It may be seen from the nitrogen balance data in Table X that when calcium carbonate was added in the diet of the same animals to bring about physiologically normal condition, the animals were better balanced but continued to grow at the same rate. As the period of calcium carbonate feeding was short, no attempt is made to study the rate of growth under the two sets of feeding.

The metabolism of the inorganic nutrients Ca and P with and without the Supplementation of calcium salt under various conditions of ulu feeding It has already been stated that no deleterious effect has been observed as a result of continuous feeding of the grass either to adult or young animals ; yet, it is true that the feeding of the grass almost at any stage of growth leads to a sort of acidosis, the degree of which appears to increase as the plant advances in maturity. Cattle urine being normally alkaline, attempts have been made to correct the acidic character of the diet by feeding the cheapest and easily available substances like wood-ash and calcium carbonate. We have previously reported that such additions of chemicals in the diet have no special advantage in so far as the utilisation of the organic nutrients is concerned. It will be of some interest now to note to what extent the metabolism of the inorganic nutrients, which are known to be absorbed from the gut under favourable condition of pH, is influenced by such treatments. Both adult and growing animals were taken as experimental subjects. The results of these investigations will now be reported. Adult animals as experimental subjects. Six local Assamese bullocks were taken for the experiments. They were fed for a sufficiently long period with ulu (prime and late cut) balanced by a concentrate mixture, except in one instance when it was fed as a single feed. The experiments may be described as follows : The grass ulu (3.5 per cent protein) was fed as a single feed (period 1). It was then fed at the prime stage (5 per cent protein) with a concentrate mixture with and without the supplementation of wood-ash (period II). The grass was finally fed also at the prime stage (5.8 per cent protein) with and without the supplementa- tion of precipitated calcium carbonate prepared in this laboratory (period III). The calcium and phosphorus balances as affected by feeding the grass in different periods are shown in Table XI. H

It may be seen from the data shown in the Table XIII that the animals retained on an average about 5.3 gm. of calcium in period I. In period II when calcium carbonate was added on the basal ration, they seem to retain calcium at the decreased rate of 3.6 gm. per day. The reaction of the urine, however, was changed from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline condition. The results of the experiments in period I and II tend to show that an acidic condition of the intestinal contents is favourable for better retention of calcium in young ones. However, in order to verify whether increased acidity is tolerated in young animals, calcium chloride was added in period III, which served two purposes viz., (a) it is a highly soluble salt which does not require prior solution before entering the intestine and (b) it is bound to make the intestinal contents more acidic than normal, when the basic roughage is either slightly acidic, neutral or slightly alkaline. The animals were kept on this diet for about a month. It is quite interesting to note that in period III, the animals retained on an average as high as 6.3 gm. of calcium per day. The urinary excretion of the mineral remained practically the same which indicates that up to a certain limit, increased acidity is better tolerated in young animals than those of the adult ones. In this connection it may be mentioned that Irving and Ferguson [1925] and Irving [1926] have shown that an acidic condition of the intestinal contents is more favourable for the absorption of calcium. In rickets, where considerable disturbances take place in the absorption mechanism the reaction of the intestinal contents as well as of the faeces is generally more alkaline than normal [Eastman and Miller, 1935 ;
September, 1950] S. K. TALAPATRA 195 Grayzel and Miller, 1928 ; Oser, 1928 ; Shohl and Bink, 1928]. As is well-known that the intestinal reaction is restored to neutrality or slight acidity when anti- rachitogenic agents such as cod-liver oil, Sunlight or ultra violet light is administered. But under the present conditions with young ulu feeding, the intestinal content is normally either slightly acidic or neutral and as such seems to be helpful to young animals for growth and bone-formation. It may be stated that the animals under the three sets of feeding were in good condition. TABLE XIV Phosphorus balance of ulu fed calves Animal number Intake Excertion Balance gm. Ulu gm.

In periods II and III however, the corresponding retention of calcium was more than that suggested by the formula Ca3(PO4)2. On an average, during these periods, about 35 per cent more of the calcium was retained. This increased retention of the mineral may be of a temporary nature, some of the added salts might have been mechanically held up somewhere in the rumen. Further work on the absorption, excretion and utilisation of calcium following the feeding of acid and alkali-forming cattle feeds is in progress. SUMMARY Cattle in Assam thrive almost entirely on grazing. With a view to ascertain the causes as to why cattle are stunted in growth and poor in production, a survey of the pasture grasses has been made. It has been found that the feeding of the predominant species of the pasture grass Imperata arundinacea, Cyrill (ulu) makes urine acidic at various stages of maturity. It grows abundantly in acid soil and is poor in protein, calcium, and phosphorus. When frequently cut and new growth allowed, the stuff becomes softer and better.
September, 1950] S. K. TALAPATRA 197 Metabolism experiments on adult and young animals show that as the grass advances in maturity, the urine tends to become more and more acidic. When fed at the early stage, the urine is neutral or slightly acidic and free from bicarbonates. The administration of wood-ash or precipitated calcium carbonate brings about normal alkaline condition but has little or no effect on the digestibility co-efficients and the net utilisation of the organic nutrients of the grass. The metabolism of calcium and phosphorus is, however, affected by various conditions of feeding. When adult animals are taken as experimental subjects a positive retention is not assured with partially mature grass whether it is fed as a single feed, balanced by a concentrate mixture or supplemented with wood-ash. When growing animals are fed with the early cut grass and a concentrate mixture, on an average 5.3 gm. of calcium are retained 20 gm. of precipitated calcium carbonate on the basal ration makes urine slightly alkaline with an average retention of 3.6 gm. of the mineral per day. When the calcium carbonate supple- mentation is withdrawn and replaced by equivalent amounts of calcium chloride to make the whole ration acidic, an average retention of 6.3 gm. of calcium has been observed. All these experiments tend to show that an acidic condition of the intestinal contents as created by early cut ulu feeding favours rapid absorption of calcium in young animals. With mature or partially mature grass, adult animals are likely to suffer from a sort of acidosis.

ASCORBIC ACID CONTENT OF OVARY AND CORPUS LUTEUM DURING VARIOUS STAGES OF OESTROUS CYCLE AND EARLY PREGNANCY By A. ROY, S. N. LUKTUKE and P. BHATTACHARYA, Animal Genetics Section, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 19 December 1949) FOR sometime past, information has accumulated to show that ascorbic acid plays an important role in the regulation of normal reproductive processes. Follicular and luteal degeneration have been reported in guinea pigs maintained on scorbutic diet. They also failed to become pregnant, or gave birth to prematurely born or dead foetus [Kramer et al., 1933]. Observations have been recorded on the increase in the ascorbic acid content of human fallopian tubes during pregnancy and the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. Very little ascorbic acid was found to be present during the proliferative phase [Joel, 1941]. It has also been reported that ascorbic acid has a progestational effect [Isarael and Meranze, 1941], as well as a mixed progestational and oestrogenic effect [Korenchevsky and Hall, 1945] on the endometrium of ovariectomized animals. Progesterone-like effect of ascorbic acid on the rabbit uterus was, however, not confirmed by Pratt [1943]. The role of ascorbic acid in regulation of the reproductive processes of farm animals has evoked much interest since the reports of Phillips et al. [1940, 1941] that the administration of ascorbic acid to certain impotent or infertile bulls and sterile cows was followed by the restoration of fertility. In view of the importance of ascorbic acid on reproductive processes, it seemed worthwhile to estimate the variation, if any, of ascorbic acid content of ovary and corpus luteum during various stages of oestrous cycle and pregnancy. MATERIAL AND METHOD Both the ovaries of buffalo cows (Bos bubalis) were collected from the abattoir within half an hour after slaughter and were immediately transported to the laboratory in jars containing freezing mixture. The ovaries were dissected free of all extraneous tissues and the corpus luteum was extruded out when present. The ovarian residue (the residual tissue remaining after the extrusion of its corpus luteum), the extruded corpus luteum and the other ovary were separately weighed. The whole of the ovary, ovarian residue and only weighed amount of corpus luteum were then extracted with a fixed volume of metaphosphoric acid (2 per cent)- trichloracetic acid (8 per cent) mixture, by grinding the tissue in porcelain mortars and then filtered. An aliquot of the filtrate was taken for the estimation of ascorbic acid by the method of Bessy and King [1933]. All estimations were done in tri- plicate. The results are presented in Tables I to III. ( 199 ) I

The importance of ascorbic acid, in relation to progesterone or any other hormone on reproductive processes must be viewed against this background. The observations that deficiency of ascorbic acid has been followed by failure of pregnancy, premature birth or still birth [Kramer et al., 1933] are presumably due to the decreased synthesis of the hormone which is primarily responsible for the implantation of the fertilized ova and the main- tenance of pregnancy, i.e. progesterone. It also makes intelligible why fertility is restored in certain impotent bulls and 'hard to settle cows' following ascorbic acid therapy [Phillips et al., 1940, 1941]. SUMMARY The ascorbic acid content of the ovaries obtained from buffalo cows at various stages of the oestrous cycle has been estimated. The two ovaries from the same animal, in one of which ovulation had occurred very recently, were found to contain 19.38 mg./100 gm. in the freshly ovulated ovary and 15.56 mg. in the other. The higher concentration in the former was found to be statistically significant. The ascorbic acid content of the ovaries in various other conditions studied were found to be of the same order. Persistant corpus luteum, compared to normal corpus luteum, is characterized by a very low concentration of ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid content of corpus luteum obtained from animals in early preg- nancy does not differ from those obtained from nonpregnant animals. The importance of ascorbic acid in relation to reproductive processes has been discussed in the light of the recent findings that ascorbic acid is concerned in the synthesis of hormones.

SEETHARAMAN, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on 2 February 1950.) THE literature extant on the subject reveals very meagre information about the blood picture of fowls suffering from Ranikhet disease. This, coupled with the availability of fowls, which are frequently employed to maintain virulent strain of the virus, induced us to study the blood of these birds during the pre- and post-infection periods. This paper records the results of examination of their blood during health and after infection. The altitude of Mukteswar-Kumaun is about 7,500 ft. above the sea-level ; the climate of the place is, for the most part of the year cold, the extreme temperatures ranging between 17.9°F. and 87.4°F. The annual rainfall is 52.28 in. and the baro- metric reading varies from 22 to 23 in. HISTORICAL Blain [1928] and Shaw [1930] expressed difficulty in counting leucocytes of fowls because the treatment of erythrocytes with diluents containing acetic acid liberated their nuclei which were indistinguishable from small lymphocytes. To overcome the difficulty, both of them advocated the use of diluting fluids by which red blood as well as white blood cells are preserved and thus could be counted simul- taneously Shaw [1933], while studying the leucocytes of pigeons, demonstrated appreciable variation in the number of leucocytes at different parts of the day. Biely and Palmer [1934] having employed the technique of Shaw [1930] gave the total blood count of healthy White Leghorns as follows : erythrocytes 21.4 to 38.4 millions per cubic millimetre and leucocytes 18.33 to 49.0 thousands per cubic millimetre. Olson [1935] recommended Toison's fluid as a diluent for the direct count of leucocytes of fowl's blood and mentioned the formula of Dukes and Sch- wart for correcting readings of haemoglobin obtained on Sahli's haemoglobino- meter. Palmer and Biely [1935] showed a rise in erythrocyte count and a fall in leucocyte count of fowls as a result of starvation for 48 hours. Olson [1937] des- cribed the morphology of various cellular elements in the blood of fowls and showed that certain normal variations in these elements were associated with factors like sex, season, keeping the birds indoors or outdoors, etc. Cook [1937] reported that the total erythrocyte and leucocyte counts of healthy chicks were 25.0 millions and 30.0 thousands per c.mm. respectively while the differential count was : lympho- cytes 74.3 per cent., polymorphonuclears 16 per cent, basophiles 20.6 per cent and monocytes 6.3 per cent. He further showed that the average haemoglobin con- centration on Sahli's scale was 60. He used Toison's fluid for making total count *Paper read at the Indian Science Congress (Section of Medical and Veterinary Sciences), Patna, 1948. ( 203 ) K
204 BLOOD PICTURE IN RANIKHET DISEASE OF FOWLS [Vol. XX, Part III of erythrocytes and leucocytes, while blood smears for differential counts were made by Wright's stain. The author correlated the alteration in blood picture with that of changes in the diet of the fowls. Twisselmann [1939] observed that the supravi- tally stained preparations, as compared to cover slip smears stained by Wright's stain, give higher percentage of polymorphs, monocytes and basophiles and a lower percentage of lymphocytes. Fluctuations in the figures of differential counts, made by Wright's stained films prepared by slide method and cover slip method, were slight. Whitby and Britton [1937] stated that leucocytosis was generally absent in virus diseases. Physiological state of the subject at the time of taking blood, the type of the film made, the method of making it and the method of counting white blood cells, were some of the important factors the standardization of which was stressed by MacGregor, Richards and Loh [1940]. It was further stated that the slide method was the most popular owing to its simplicity and the ease with which a good film could be obtained. ' Edge ', ' battlement ' and ' cross section ' methods of examination of blood smears were reported to be more common than the method of random selection of fields for differential counts of leucocytes. Monthly differential counts, of twelve Europeans, by these three methods revealed that straight ' or ' edge ' count gave a consistently higher figure for polymorphon- uclears than that obtained by the ' cross section ' count. As regards lymphocytes the position was just the reverse. ' Battlement ' count showed a result between the values obtained by random counting of 300 cells. Napier and Das Gupta [1940] were of opinion that the slide method as advocated by MacGregor, Richards and Loh [1940] was superior to the cover slip method, so far as the determination of differential leucocyte count was concerned. McCarthy [1943] stated that the factor of diurnal variation was not to be ignored while measuring concentration of hae- moglobin in blood. Lewis and Shope [1928] and Kernkamp [1939] reported marked leucopenia in swines suffering from natural and artificial infection of hog cholera. Kernkamp reported that leucopenia was associated with distinct rise and fall in the percentage of polymorphonuclears (heterophiles) and lymphocytes respectively. He also observed leucocytosis in swines suffering from inflammatory diseases of lungs and gastrointestinal tract but free from hog cholera. Severe leucopenia was encountered by Hammon and Enders [1939] in cats suffering from a virus disease. Distemper in ferrets was also shown to produce leucopenia by Kirk and Collins [1945], while Verma [1947] experienced a similar phenomenon in rinderpest in goats. MATERIALS AND METHODS Birds of the same sex and approximately of the same age were employed through- out. Fifteen known healthy Rhode Island Red male adult fowls were used during the course of the investigation. Birds in cages were kept indoors in a well ventilated room. The diet given to all the fowls was similar both in quantity and quality. Diet was given twice a day. Water was constantly available in the cage. Blood was always collected from the heart in the morning before the birds were fed. The anticoagulant consisting of 2.4 mg. of potassium oxalate was used according to the recommendation of Napier and Das Gupta [1940]. Heart blood was collected in the following manner : One attendant holds the bird by the root of its wings in the left hand and the legs in the right and puts the bird flat on a working table. The operator with the bird in his right hand plucks the feathers
September, 1950] G. L. SHARMA AND C. SEETHARAMAN 205 from the sternal area which is then cleaned with absolute alcohol and allowed to dry. The operator then feels for the heart beat with the fingers of his left hand. The beat is almost invariably located to be most prominent at the space between the sternum and the root of its posterior lateral process. This point is generally about a couple of inches on the line drawn backwards and upwards from the point of the sternum. A wide bore needle fitted to a 5 c.c. syringe is gently introduced at this point, downwards, forwards and a little to the right. When the point of the needle touches the heart the beat is prominently felt by the operator and the needle is then carefully pushed further. The blood starts flowing into the syringe on the application of a gentle pull to the piston. Usually 3 c.c. of blood was drawn at each puncture. The needle is then carefully withdrawn and immediately dis- connected from the syringe and the blood run along the side of the test tube contain- ing the required quantity of the anti-coagulant. The tube is shaken for about two minutes to ensure a thorough mixing of the oxalate powder with the blood. The examination of the blood was immediately started and the procedure adopted was : (1) preparing smears, (2) estimation of the percentage of haemo- globin, (3) estimation of corpuscular volume, (4) determining total erythrocyte and leucocyte counts and (5) examining the smears for differential count. It generally took about four hours to go through the whole procedure. Blood from each fowl was examined on two consecutive days and then the bird was infected with virulent Ranikhet disease virus. Birds so treated were generally found to develop clinical symptoms of the disease in about 72 hours and invariably succumbed to it after 96 to 120 hours. Examination of the blood for the study of changes in the disease, was, therefore, conducted on the third and fourth day after infection. Technique (a) Examination of smears. Uniformly thin films were made. In order to take the same quantity of blood for making uniform smears, a platinum loop with a diameter of 2 mm. was employed throughout this work. Smears were stained by Giemsa's method. A combination of ' edge ' and ' cross section ' methods was employed for differential white blood cell count and the number of leucocytes counted in each examination was in no case less than 200. (b) Haemoglobin determination. Haemoglobin percentage was estimated by Sahli's haemoglobinometer and the reading so obtained corrected by Dukes and Schwart's formula given by Olson [1935]. (c) Total erythrocyte and leucocyte counts. For total erythrocyte and leucocyte counts the stage with Neuber's ruling was used while Toison's fluid served as the diluent. Red blood pipette was employed in collecting the blood. (d) Corpuscular volume and the time required for the complete sedimentation of corpuscles. Scrupulously clean Wintrobes haematocrit tubes (length 11 cm. ; bore 2.5 mm. graduated with a centimetre and millimetre scale 10 cm. in length) were used. Two such tubes filled with blood up to the mark ' 10 ' were centrifuged at a speed of about 3000 rounds per minute. At first the tubes were spun for ten minutes and subsequently for periods of five minutes each. After each interval the centrifuge machine was switched off and allowed to come to a standstill by itself and the corpuscular volume noted. When two consecutive readings were constant K 2
206 BLOOD PICTURE IN RANIKHET DISEASE OF FOWLS [Vol. XX, Part III no more centrifugation was done The time taken by the first one was reckoned as the time required for the complete sedimentation of corpuscles. The corpus- cular volume was directly read from the tubes. RESULTS Mean values of the readings in health and in disease and their statistical ana- lysis are incorporated in Tables I and II respectively. Two fowls died of Ranikhet disease on the fourth day before the collection of blood. The readings of these fowls for the post-infection period are, therefore, those taken on the third day after infection. All the other thirteen birds died on the fifth day and showed characteristic leisons of Ranikhet disease. It would appear from Table I that almost in every case there was a marked drop in the total eryth- rocyte and leucocyte count during the disease, and along with this there was a fall in the haemoglobin concentration. It was also observed that the fall in the leu- cocyte count was accompanied by a high rise in the percentage of heterophiles and a fall in that of lymphocytes. In healthy birds, on the other hand, the percentage relationship between heterophiles and lymphocytes was found to be completely reversed. There is no significant difference in the number of eosinophiles, mono- cytes and basophiles during the disease. Corpuscular volume and the time taken for the complete sedimentation of corpuscles showed a distinct variation in the post- infection period. Reference to Table II would show that the changes, in the total erythrocyte and leucocyte counts, in haemoglobin concentration, in corpuscular volume, in the time taken for complete sedimentation of corpuscles and in the percentages of heterophiles and lymphocytes produced during the disease, are highly significant. This, however, is not the case with the variations in the proportion of eosinophiles, monocytes and basophiles. DISCUSSION It will be seen from the data presented in Tables I and II that the onset of Ranikhet disease is clearly marked by leucopenia and a high rise in the percentage of heterophiles. Eosinophiles, monocytes and basophiles exhibit no significant variation. Lymphocytes, on the other hand, are very much reduced in number. There is a distinct fall in the total erythrocyte count during the disease. Along with this is observed a significant fall in the corpuscular volume and in the concentra- tion of haemoglobin. The time taken for the complete sedimentation of cells is also reduced. It is already stated that detailed information regarding changes in the blood picture of fowls suffering from Ranikhet disease is scanty. However, it is interest- ing to note, as already stated, that the results embodied in this article are in con- formity with those obtained by Lewis and Shope [1929] and Kernkamp [1939] in hog cholera, Hammon and Enders [1939] in a virus disease of cats, Kirk and Collins [1945] in ferret distemper and Verma [1947] in rinderpest in goats. In the light of the above remarks it appears that leucopenia is not a condition that can be taken as specific for any particular virus disease. On the other hand it may be stated that perhaps in majority of the virus diseases haemopoitic tissues are affected in such a manner as to produce leucopenia.

208 BLOOD PICTURE IN RANIKHET DISEASE OF FOWLS [Vol. XX, Part III TABLE 1September, 1950] G. L. SHARMA AND C. SEETHARAMAN 209 As regards eosinophiles, monocytes and basophiles, it may be mentioned that during usual examination of blood films, the number of the respective cells counted is very small due to their low percentages. Variations in the number of these cells, even if present during the disease, may, therefore, escape detection. It is, therefore, felt that in order to have a clearer picture about the position of these cells total number of leucocytes counted for differential count should be much more, say about a thousand, than what is actually done. During examination of blood smears for differential counts it was observed that the results obtained were quite different in different parts of the smear. Though a study of this problem was not within the purview of this work, our experience agrees with that of MacGregor, Richards and Loh [1940] as far as the possibility of getting different figures by examining different parts of the smear is concerned. It was in the light of these preliminary observations that combination of ' edge ' and ' cross section ' method was followed throughout. In almost every smear there occurred roundish, rose-red bodies. Their margin was often broken. On closer examination a relatively darker but similarly stained round structure could be detected in the centre of these bodies. Similar bodies were observed too by DeVillers [1938] who considered them to be ruptured erythrocytes. Toison's fluid was found quite satisfactory for diluting blood for direct count of leucocytes and erythrocytes. Thrombocytes because of their being the smallest cellular constituent of blood, could be distinguished from the red blood and white cells, with difficulty. SUMMARY Heart blood of fifteen adult Rhode Island Red male fowls was examined during health and after the onset of Ranikhet disease induced artificially. Toison's fluid was used as diluent for the counting of erythrocytes and leu- cocytes. For differential counts blood smears were examined by the combination of ' edge ' and ' cross section ' methods of examining smears. During the disease there occurred a marked leucopenia associated with a dis- tinct rise and fall in the percentages of heterophiles and lymphocytes respectively. The number of erythrocytes and haemoglobin concentration dropped markedly and the corpuscular volume was reduced. There was a significant reduction in the time taken for the complete sedimentation of cells. Percentages of eosinophiles, monocytes and basophiles did not undergo any appreciable variation during the disease. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Our thanks are due to Dr H. N. Ray for valuable advice and Mr. S. Sen for statistical analysis of the results.

TURKMAN, Poultry Research Section, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, Uttar Pradesh. (Received for publication on 1 June 1949) THE total poultry population in India in comparison with human population is very small indeed and the backward state of the poultry industry may be due to various factors such as, poor quality of the stock, lack of knowledge in regard to the value of eggs in the diet, prejudice and taboo to keeping fowls, prevalence of diseases, etc. The desi (or indigenous) hen lays, on an average, 53 eggs in a year while 150 is the average figure in the case of certain exotic breeds. In recent years, improvement has been mainly confined to running Government Farms and the distribution of exotic breeds. Till the second world war, production even on Government Farms was not profitable, for the prices of poultry products were too low to meet the cost of production. That is why commercial farms were unknown in this country. The demand for poultry and eggs from the Defence Services shot up during the war and the village flocks were being depleted as attractive prices were being offered. The problem of increasing the egg production in the country, therefore, received serious consideration of the Government of India and 16 military poultry farms in all were organized in the country in order to aug- ment the supplies. In the villages actually no expenditure is incurred for labour, housing and equipment and birds are generally allowed to find their own food. Still bulk of the poultry products in India comes from the villages. To investigate the economics of village poultry keeping and to suggest methods of improvement, a scheme of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research was undertaken by the Poultry Research Section, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar for a period of five years (1943-48), and was initiated by the late Mr. A. J. Macdonald, Officer-in-Charge of the Section. OUTLINE AND WORKING OF THE SCHEME Purebred birds of White Leghorn, Rhode Island Red, desi and their crosses, hatched and reared up to six months of age on the Institute farm, Izatnagar, were distributed in selected villages of Uttar Pradesh. Ten pullets and one cock were given free to each of the villagers on the distinct under standing that the birds would be kept pure for a full period of twelve months, thereby affording facilities to the staff for collection of data regarding egg production, mortality, fertility, hatchability and marketing of eggs, etc. At the end of this period of twelve month's the birds were given away to the villagers.

212 POULTRY KEEPING IN INDIAN VILLAGES [Vol. XX, Part III Site Suitability of different areas. A total of 48 villages in Uttar Pradesh both in the plains as well as hills in the districts of Bareilly, Pilibhit, Nainital including T. & B. Estate, Almora and Sitapur were selected. The conditions in the villages, close to the Institute farm in the district of Bareilly, are typical of most parts of the Northern India having a maximum shade temperature of 117°F. The selected villages were fairly large and there was a fairly good market only five miles away in Bareilly. Banbasa in the Pilibhit district is an undeveloped area lying near the head- quarters of the Sarda canal. There is, however, a good market for eggs from the employees of the Irrigation Department. Jeolikote, a hill station of Nainital district about twelve miles from Kathgodam, has no extremes of climates, snow fall is quite rare and has good markets in the vicinity. Kicha, in the same district lying 20 miles from the foot hills of the Hima- layas, is rather a backward area on account of the heavy incidence of malaria, with fairly heavy rainfall. There is a great demand for poultry and eggs from the Moham- medan population in this area. It is close to Nainital where eggs fetch a good price, say rupees three per dozen. Bazpur, ten miles from the foot hills in the Nainital district, also has heavy rainfall. The presence of nearby jungle is, however, a menace to poultry stock on account of its being exposed to frequent attacks by wild animals. Champawat, 6000 ft. above sea-level in the Almora district, is quite cool all the year round with snow fall during winter. The rainfall is fairly high and compares favourably with that of Kicha, Bazpur and Banbasa. No marketing facilities are available and the eggs produced in this area are consumed by the local inhabitants, who are mostly literate and well-to-do. The villages selected in the district of Sitapur have extremes of weather. As most of the inhabitants are non-vegetarians there is considerable scope for poultry development in this area. The data on the average annual egg production and losses due to mortality in the different areas are given in Table I. Better results were obtained from the villages around Izatnagar in the Bareilly district due largely to the human factor, for in this area it was possible to select a large number of keen villagers who had long experience of poultry keeping and who came into fairly close touch with the Institute farm. The egg production figures for the birds distributed to a large number of educated classes in the Kicha and Banbasa areas rank second. On the other hand low egg production obtained in Sitapur and Jeolikote was due to tick infestation and paucity of animal protein supplements. A total of 436 pullets out of 896 distributed, died. Losses from contagious diseases such as Ranikhet disease were experienced in the first year of the scheme, In the subsequent year, however it was possible to vaccinate the birds against this disease prior to distribution by using the chick embryo vaccine. The birds were also protected against fowl pox. Tick troubles were all too common in the

Birds affected with tick fever were treated with drugs such as Sulphar- senol while the seed ticks infesting the chickens were easily eradicated by applica- tions of derris root suspensions. During summer and monsoon months lice infesta- tions were also prevalent which retarded egg production. Dusting of the birds with sodium flouride or D. D. T. powder, readily obtainable from chemists, and painting of the perches with kerosene or coal tar has given satisfactory results in eradicating the lice. The greatest drain of poultry in villages is losses due to attacks from predatory animals and unless some satisfactory housing accommodation with regular feeding of grains, morning and evening, is provided for the birds, poultry keeping may not attract the villagers. About 45 per cent of the total losses was due to diseases of reproductive organs and general debility following malnutrition and mismanagement. The average egg production of the different breeds and crosses in the villages under different system of management is given in Table II. The high rate of production of imported breeds of poultry is not maintained in the villages unless the birds are adequately fed. Crosses and the improved desi (indigenous) birds have in some cases laid larger number of eggs under the primitive village conditions than the pure breeds. In 1939 a pen of desi pullets was raised from the eggs of village fowls. By selective breeding over a period of six years the average annual egg production as well as egg size have been increased considerably and the improvement maintained in successive generations. The production was the poorest in the case of White Leghorns while Rhodes gave better production. If feeding was adequate the role of housing in relation to production was only secondary, while if both good feeding and housing were given, the results were pro- portionately better. On the other hand, birds housed and fed well under skilled management gave the best returns. The poorest results were obtained from the units kept under primitive conditions, i.e. no housing accommodation, birds drinking sewage water, feeding on refuse and exposed to vermin infestations. The birds in villages are generally housed in temporary dungeons which are much too small, improperly ventilated and unhygienic. From the purely developmental aspect, it is not much good advising expensive housing but it is possible to devise cheap improved houses from purely indigenous material such as kutcha bricks, bamboos and arhar (Cajanus indicus) sticks. From general observations over a number of years it would appear that good housing tends to discourage infestation with parasites which interfere with the general health of the stock. Experience has also shown that with little skill and instruction this very village poultry keeping can be made a paying hobby and will become a profitable cottage industry. The data also show that reasonably good results with layers can be obtained in the villages provided that the villagers are progressive. Hatching and rearing Table III gives the hatching results with natural incubation and mortality in rearing up to three months of age.

Due to the difficulty of obtaining broody hens during the hatching season the villagers are reluctant to produce re- placement stocks and valuable hatching eggs are, therefore, being consumed in their household. The introduction of cooperative hatching by artificial methods merits consideration combined with vigorours propaganda among the people about the economic value of poultry keeping. A total of 653 chickens (54.7 per cent) died of different causes. Young chicks are frequently attacked by wild birds and this can only be prevented by confining the former in runs which could be constructed at little or no expense from indigenous materials such as bamboo strips. As cheap production can only be carried out under free range condition which will reduce feeding costs, it would appear that the only practical solution is to keep the birds away from jackals, pariah dogs and wild cats as far as possible. Food consumption being very low during the rearing period (0-8 weeks) confinement will not cost much as a chicken consumes only about 4 lb. of mash and grain during this period. Marketing With the exception of Bazpur, Champawat and Banbasa which are outlying areas, there appeared to be no need for cooperative marketing, for most of the other centres were within the reach of good markets. In the Kicha area hawkers came regularly to collect the eggs for despatch to hill stations and the price remained steady throughout the period. In Jeolikote and Sitapur the prices ranged from Rs. 1-8 to Rs. 2 per dozen. In the Izatnagar area (Bareilly District) egg collectors came fairly regularly and the price ranged from Re. 1 to Rs. 1-2 per dozen. The lowest prices in the plains were generally obtained during the period from April to September when there was a drop in demand owing to poor quality of eggs and reluctance of people to eating eggs during summer months. On the contrary, the demand for eggs and poultry on the hills during this period was just the reverse.
September, 1950] MACDONALD, IYER AND TURKMAN 217 In the villages, cock birds are usually allowed to run with hens all the year round, as it is erroneously believed that the hen will not lay without the influence of the cock. During summer months, fertility of the vast bulk of eggs produced in the villagers adds greatly to the difficulties of marketing. Villagers will be well advised to keep the male birds separately from the hens during hot periods of the year which will considerably reduce the number of eggs going bad and inedible on account of embryonic growth. In cases where this is not possible, the male birds may be used for table or the eggs produced in the summer and rainy months may be specially treated (defertilised) by immersing in water at 130°F. for fifteen minutes. This process is very necessary as the sale of even one bad egg will adversely affect the consumption figures and the consumer will sooner or later look for other foods. Conservation of the quality of eggs produced should be the order of the day. SUMMARY Though poultry keeping may be more difficult in hot climates than in temperate zones, sufficient data are, at present, available to show that poultry can be kept any where, only they should be fed and housed well for satisfactory returns. Losses due to attacks from wild animals and birds were all too common, and 50 percent of the layers distributed were lost due to causes which could be avoided. Routine vaccination of birds against the common contagious diseases, ranikhet disease and fowl pox, is essential for successful poultry keeping in villages. The high rate of production of the improved breeds was not obtained in the villages unless the birds were adequately fed. If feeding was adequate, the role of housing in relation to production was only secondary, but if the birds were given good feeding and good housing the results would be proportionately better. Birds housed and fed well under skilled manage- ment gave the best returns. The crosses gave somewhat better results than the pure breeds as regards egg production and hence extensive grading up programme is recommended for increasing the egg production in the villages. Food consumption being very low, confinement of chickens between 0-8 weeks is recommended as the losses amongst chickens were mainly due to attacks by predatory animals. From the purely developmental aspect it is not much good advising expensive housing but it is possible to devise cheap improved houses from purely village materials.

ABSTRACTS The value of Winter Pasture and Sweet Potato Meal for Lactating Dairy Cows. JENNINGS, B. FRYE (Jr.) GEORGE E. HAWKINS (Jr.) and HERBERT B. HEDER- SON (1948). (J. Dairy Sci.,OCT., 897 (Dairy Dept., Univ. Georgia, Athens)) THE authors, in this paper, have studied the value of winter grazing versus dry roughage feeding, and also the possibilities of replacing corn by sweet potato meal as the main source of the carbohydrate in the ration for lactating dairy cows. Fifteen cows of the University of Georgia herd were divided in three groups for these trials. The dry fed group received hay ad lib. and a concentrate mixture consisting of 30.2 per cent of corn. The pasture group was provided approximately eight hours grazing each day in addition to the above ration. The third group was supplied sweet potato meal in place of corn in the concentrate rations. Cows on pasture consumed approximately 46 per cent less dry roughage and produced 15.6 per cent more milk and 18 per cent more butter fat than the dry-lot-fed animals. The flavour of the milk from these cows was also very pleasing to taste, except when these cows were milked immediately after being removed from pasture. Cows fed on a concentrate mixture consisting of either corn or sweet potato meal did not show any significant difference in the amount of milk and butter fat produced or in the flavour score of milk. The animals relished both the concentrate mixtures equally. The sweet potato meal did not have any adverse effect upon the digestive system of the cows. (R.S.) Dehydrated Sweet Potatoes as a Concentrate Feed for Dairy Cattle. MATHER, ROBA E., LINKONS WOODROW N., and EHEART JAMES F. (1948). J. Dairy Sci., 31, (7), 569-576 SELECTION of the best quality sweet potatoes for human consumption yields culls which may be dehydrated and used for animal feed. High yields of sweet potatoes in some areas may justify growing them specifically for animal feeding. Dehydrated sweet potatoes, when fed to twelve dairy cows in a 75-day double change over experiment, were found to have 91.4 per cent of the value of ground yellow corn on hundred per cent replacement of the corn. When the replacement was only fifty per cent, they were 94.8 per cent as valuable. In a digestion trial using four mature cows, the main constituent nigtrogen free extract showed a digestibility of 90.08 @ 0.43 per cent. On the basis of the digestion coefficients obtained, the total digestible nutrient value was found to be 70.4 per cent on a 12 per cent moisture basis. Dehydrated sweet potatoes were found to excel yellow corn in maintaining high level of carotene and vitamin A in the blood plasma and milk and these qualities would counteract their slightly lower milk producing value.

220 ABSTRACTS [Vol. XX, Part III The Effect of a High Preheating Temperature with and without Ethyl Gallate on the Storage Life of Whole Milk Powder Spray Dried on a Gray Jensen Drier. WHITE, J. C. D., SMITH, J. A. B., and LEA, G. H. (1947). J. Dairy Res. 15, 127 A GRAY-JENSEN drier was used to prepare whole-milk powder from the same bulk of raw milk, preheated to either 160°F. or 190°F. and storage studies were made at two different centres under controlled conditions at 47°C., 37°C. and 15°C. and at room temperature, with and without the addition of ethyl gallate. Besides determining the miosture, copper and ' readily extractable free fat' contents of the milk powders, the flavour of the reconstituted milk, the oxygen absorbed by the powders and their peroxide values were also estimated at different stages of storage to evaluate their keeping properties. It has been confirmed that the storage life of spray dried whole milk powder could be extended by raising the preheating tempearture from 160°F. to 190°F. but with the disadvantage of a ' cooked ' flavour in the reconstituted milk. The addition of 0.07 per cent ethyl gallate at the lower preheating temperature of 160°F. extended the life of the powder two to three times when stored at 37°C. However, the low temperature preheated, gallate-treated sample speedily developed a rather marked flavour and odour, similar to ' incipient tallowy ' taint and thus it has been tentatively concluded that low temperature preheating plus ethyl gallate is not to be preferred to high temperature preheating without ethyl gallate. It has been established that use of the higher temperature for preheating and incorporation of ethyl gallate extended the storage life of the powder considerably and is perhaps to be preferred to high-temperature preheating and gaspacking for moderate periods of storage. (A.K.) The Properties of New Zealand Butters and Butterfats. (1) Iodine, Reichert Samples of Butterfats from nine Commercial Factories over Four Years. Cox, G. A. and McDOWALL, F. H. (1948). J. Dairy Res., 15, 377 THE iodine, Reichert and saponification values and softening points of butter- fats from butters collected at monthly intervals over a period of four years from nine factories in New Zealand are reported. The trend of variations of any one of the properties was remarkably uniform throughout a season and during different seasons of the year and the same periodicity was noticed in all the four years. But the maxima and minima for all the four properties studied did not occur during the same season. The weighted monthly averages of iodine, Reichert and sponification values and softening points of butterfats which have been cal- culated rather than the straight average of the results obtained, have been found to be 36.7 (33.8-40.2), 30.4 (25.5-32.3), 229.5 (225.5-232.7) and 33.1 (32.2-33.7) respectively. The minimum iodine value occurred in midsummer, i.e. at the season of the year when maximum values are reported for northern hemisphere butters. South Island butterfats diverged markedly from those of the North Island samples in having low iodine values during winter months, which may be due to the feeding of turnips to the cows and consistently less softening points throughout the year. The interrelationship of the different properties did not follow accepted lines and explanation of this observation will have to await further detailed examination of the fatty acids of butterfat during different seasons of the year.

September, 1950] ABSTRACTS 221 Cleaning and Sterilization of Dairy Plants. ROWLANDS, A. (1949) J. Dairy Tech., 2, 152-159 THE paper deals with the importance of cleaning and sterilization of dairy plants, methods of ascertaining the cleanliness and sterility of dairy utensils and the choice of suitable detergents and disinfectants for the purpose. Objective methods of evaluating cleanliness, by photoelectric measurements of the surface film on cleaned slides, cannot be practised in the dairies where reliance has yet to be placed wholly on visual inspection. The available methods of ascer- taining plant sterility by themselves are not sufficient. An examination of the first milk that passes through the plant gives valuable information about the extent of contamination, specially when the examination is conducted on a sample aged for 24 hours at 65°F. to 72°F. The author is of the opinion that cleaning and sterilization whether carried out separately or simultaneously are both equally essential and indispensable. The difficulties, arising out of the formation of hardened milk residues on dairy farm equipments, can be best avoided by emphasizing the need for a rinse, with cold or tepid water, immediately after the milk is removed. A comparison of steam, hot water, hot alkalies and other chemical agents has been made with regard to their comparative sterilizing efficiency. The suitability of each of these, for sterilizing specific plant parts and the limitations for their applicability, has been indicated. Steam at a temperature of 195°F./5 minutes or 170°F./15 minutes is recommended for general farm equipments and for dairy plants where it is feasible and economical to reach the desired temperature quickly and for the desired time. Hot water at temperatures higher than 180°F. is recommended for immersable farm equipments and for closed systems in plants through which water can be circulated. Use of chlorine in a concentration of 200 to 250 p.p.m. is recommended for large storage tanks and open surfaces such as coolers open vats, etc. For the after rinse, while employing chlorine, 10 p.p.m. of chlorine is recommend- ed to be added to the water if its quality is suspicious. In employing alkalies as disinfectants, such as in bottle sterilization, a minimum pH limit of 10 in the detergent solution is considered essential. Substances such as sodium metasilicate, trisodium phosphate and sodium hexametaphosphate are not to be used singly but should always be used along with a basic concentration of caustic soda. The use of quaternary ammonium compounds vis a vis hypochlorite has been discussed. The former's suitability by virtue of its noncorrosibility, nonirritability to the skin and freedom from undesirable odour is admitted. The limitations in its application have, however, been indicated in presence of soaps formed in bottle washing detergents, sodium hexametaphosphate, sodium metasilicate and water containing over 10 p.p.m. of iron. (M.R.S.) Deterioration on Storage of Dried Skim Milk. HENRY, KATHLEEN M., KON, S. K., LEA, C. H. and WHITE, J. C. D. (1948) J. Dairy Res., 15, (3) 292-363 THE authors have carried out a detailed investigation in regard to deterioration on storage of skim milk powder. For this purpose spray dried separated milk powder of low (2.9 per cent), medium (4.7 per cent) and high (7.3 per cent) miosture content, packed in air and nitrogen, was stored at 20°C. 28.5C., and 37°C. for
222 ABSTRACTS [Vol. XX, Part III nearly two years. At frequent intervals, the content of sample cane were examined organoleptically and by various physical and chemical methods. On the basis of these tests, stored powders were further examined for changes in the biological value of the proteins and for microbiological assay of ' essential ' amino acids. Little change was observed in the powders of low and medium moisture content, except in palatability and gas exchange at the higher temperatures. The powder of the highest moisture content, particularly at the higher storage temperatures, rapidly became unpalatable, discoloured and insoluble. In the case of nitrogen packed sample ' heated ' or ' caramelized ' flavour was produced, while in case of air packed powders more objectionable ' stale ' flavour developed. The biological value of the proteins of dried skim milk of high moisture content decreased progressively during storage in air at 37°C., whereas that of medium moisture content proved more stable and of low moisture content seemed to be least affected under any conditions of storage. The decrease in the biological value of proteins was slightly more marked in air packed than in gas packed samples ; the decrease being accounted for by the loss or inactivation of lysine and probably some loss of histidine. It is concluded that skim milk powders containing not more than five per cent moisture can be stored in air or gas pack at temperatures upto 28.5°C. (83°F.) for at least two years, without suffering detectable loss in the nutritive value of their proteins, though with a serious loss of flavour in the former and a less marked loss in the latter. Furthermore, it seems likely that under all conditions of storage skim milk powder will become unpalatable before it suffers any appreciable loss in the nutritive value of its proteins. (S.D.) A Note on the Bacteriological Aspects of Distribution of Heat-treated Milk in Churn. CROSSLEY, E. L. and PATTEN, E. M. (1949) Proc. Soc. app. Bact. (2), 58-61 PERIODIC reports that the heat treated milk transported in churns from long distances failed to satisfy the milk standards of authorities in retail distribution areas, prompted this present investigation. Samples of milk were collected from milk churns intended for transport and were stored in shade at atmos- pheric temperature for the determination of total bacterial counts and presumptive coliform tests at the end of 2, 24, and 48 hours of storage. Methylene blue reduction time was also determined after 24 and 48 hours of storage under similar conditions. Results showed that the increase in colony count was negligible even after 43 hours of storage when the atmospheric temperature ranged between 30°F. and 49°F. ; when, however, the temperature ranged between 60°F. and 70°F., the count exceeded the legal standard of 100,000 bacteria per ml. even after 24 hours of storage. About 40 per cent of the samples reacted positive to the coliform test in 0.01 ml. amounts, thus, failing to satisfy the legal standard. The methylene blue reduction time even after ageing for 24 hours at 60°F. to 70°F. was 3 hours much longer than the legally permissible standard of 30 minutes. When ageing was extended up to 48 hours at 60°F. to 70°F. the reduction time was half hour. Thus, methylene blue reduction test approved on an average 70 per cent of samples whereas colony count and coliform test passed only 48 per cent of the samples maintained under similar conditions.
September, 1950] ABSTRACTS 223 The authors conclude that the solution lies only in improving the conditions of distribution rather than in changing the method of testing. They suggest that pasteurization and bottling should be carried on at the same premises with adequate refrigeration of milk until delivery and that churn transport of pasteurized milk should be minimized and be restricted to short distances only. (V.S.M.) Some Observations on the Bacterial Flora in Farm Water Supplies. THOMAS, S. B. and THOMAS, B. S. (1947) Proc. Soc. app. Bact., 2, 65-69 SAMPLES numbering 126 of farm water supplies of Wales (England) were studied for the distribution of types of bacteria and their possible contaminating influence in dairy products. Sixty per cent of the water supplies contained more than 50 coli organisms per 100 ml. which is a standard suggested for small rural water supplies. Furthermore 60 per cent ranged between 1 and 50 coliform bacteria per 100 ml. of the supplies. The presence of faecal coli organisms is regarded as unsatisfactory in dairy water. As many as 82 per cent of the water supplies showed the presence of milk souring organisms in 1 ml. of sample. Samples of contaminated surface water contained lipolytic and proteolytic organisms which fermented milk within two days when incubated at 22°C. The saprophytic organisms detected in water samples included many types. These acted upon fat and other constituents of dairy products stored even at refri- gerator temperatures. These types were frequently found in water supplies, and their presence must be regarded as unsatisfactory. Thermoduric bacteria were detected in 70 per cent of the water samples and 20 per cent of these were capable of proteolytic or acid producing activity in milk. The need for the development of some simple but reliable test for indicating the influence of the bacterial content of water on the keeping quality of milk has been clearly brought out. (B.N.G.) Experiments on the Transmission of Streptococcus agalactiae Infection by Milking with Infected Hands. LANCASTER, J. E and STUART, P. (1949) J. Comp. Path. 59, 19-30 MILK infected with Streptococcus agalactiae type IIIa was smeared, immediately before each milking for a period of 15 weeks, on to the teats of 18 cows comprising 7 first calved heifers, 5 second calvers, both with no previous history of Streptococcus agalactiae infection, and six older cows, which had previously been infected and cured. Bacteriological and other examinations made five times weekly during this period revealed infection in 27 quarters of 12 cows, i.e., in 2 out of 7 heifers, in four out of five second calves and in all the older cows. The difference in susceptibility or resistance was shown in respect of time and the proportions of cows and quarters infected. By the end of the experiment the clinical picture resembled that of a severe outbreak of Streptococcus agalactiae mastitis in the field.
224 ABSTRACTS [Vol. XX, Part III Results indicated that Streptococcus agalactiae persisted equally well on the outside of the teats of susceptible and resistant cows. Greater susceptibility of older cows was attributed to an inherent factor, which also accounted for the infection in their earlier lactation, rather than their age. Perhaps damage done by one infection predisposed another. Data are provided to show the relation between infection and appearance of clots and the relation between results of direct plating and enrichment. The association of previous infection with other organisms or of non-specific abnormalities with susceptibility to subsequent Streptococcus agalactiae infection is discussed. (M.M.S.) Factors Modifying Host Resistance to Helminthic Infection. ASA C. CHANDLER (1948) Proc. 4th Int. Congr. Trop. Med. Malaria 2, 975-981 RESISTANCE to helminthic infections may be specific or non-specific. Spe- cific or immunological reactions are brought about by metabolic products of the worms. Non-specific or environmental forms of resistance include such factors as age, diet and inherent characteristics. Worms having a parenteral phase may stimulate general immunity with the production of circulating antibodies. Tissue dissolving worms located in the intestine may stimulate local immunity. Immunity leads to resistance to super-infection and often to expulsion of worms. Resistance to Acanthocephala and adult cestoda is mainly environmental as they can stimulate little or no immunity. Diet greatly influences resistance. Deficiency of vitamins A or B may increase the number of intestinal nematodes by interfering with normal peristalsis. Deficiency of calcium, phosphorus and iron may lower resistance by directly affecting the host. A prolonged inadequate diet lowers immunity due to the resulting deficiency of gamma globulin. Loss of blood, chronic diseases, lactation, pregnancy, etc., are other factors which lower the host resistance. Resistance increases with age. A non-specific factor for age resistance is the increase in the number of goblet cells of the intestine. Age resistance may also be due to increased speed to development of acquired immunity. The nature of the inherent characteristics modifying resis- tance is little understood. In case of Acanthocephala and adult cestode infections host starvation is inimical to parasites and lead to their expulsion due to carbohy- drate depletion. Chandler concludes that a poor diet deficient in protein and vitamins is injuri- ous to the host in all helminthic infections ; in case of the immunity stimulating group it lowers host resistance while in case of Acanthocephala and adult cestode it affects the host directly. (S.C.D.) Some Observations on the Effect of Newcastle Disease upon Laying Fowls. PLATT, C. S. (1948) Poult. Sci., 27, 201-206 THE outbreak under study which occurred in Egg Laying Tests was diagnosed as Newcastle (or Ranikhet) disease by means of serum-egg virus neutralization tests on the recovered fowls. Neutralization of 100 lethal doses virus was interpretted as indicating experience with the infection, while neutralization of 1000 or more doses
September, 1950] ABSTRACTS 225 was an evidence of past infection. The layout of the fowl houses and pens of the Egg Laying Tests and the rapidity and direction of spread of the disease therein are described in detail. The author states that the spread of the disease at time was very rapid, while at other time as weak or more elapsed with no new pens showing symptoms of the diseases. Close contact from pen to pen was not a major factor in the order of the spread of the disease. At one test (place) where there was an outbreak of the disease, mortality before the egg production returned to normal was Leghorns 1.1 per cent ; heavy breeds 3.3 per cent. At another test following vaccination against the disease, the mortality in Leghorns was 5.1 per cent for pullets, 11.1 per cent for hens. The mortality following vaccination in the case of heavy breeds was relatively low. In birds affected with Newcastle disease the author studied the laying perfor- mances and states that a sharp decline in egg production is one typical external symptom of the disease. In the case of birds in lay there was a drop from a produc- tion of 74.7 per cent on the day of vaccination to zero 8 days later ; egg production, however, returned to normal within four to five weeks following a marked drop in production irrespective of the fact that the infection was of natural origin or by means of vaccination (perhaps with living mitigated virus). There was considerable variation between pens in time elapsing before production returned to the level existing before the infection. The author attributes this to factors inherent in the stock either of genetic nature or connected with environment earlier in the life of the fowls. In India and several other countries especially of the Far East the mortality following natural infection is usually 98 per cent. Insignificant mortality combined with considerable economic loss through drop in egg production following vaccina- tion or natural infection, in the U. S. A., are points of paramount interest to the Indian poultry keeper. (S.G.I.) The Nutrition of the New Born Dairy Calf. The Response to a Photolised Milk Diet. WARNER, R. G. and SUTTON, T. S. (1948) J. Dairy Sci. 31, (11) 976 THE authors have carried out an experiment to study the effect of feeding calves with natural milk in which the major portion of the riboflavin has been destroyed by light. The influence of riboflavin factor upon the absorption of vita- min A and ascorbic acid by calves and its requirement in the nutrition of them has also been studied. Photolised milk was prepared by subjecting the natural milk to the rays of D. H. 400 Watt mercury vapour lamp. Biological inadequacy of the photolised milk was verified by a rat growth test. Four pure bred male Gurnsey calves were used in this experiment. Two calves A and B were given photolised colostrum while the other two C and R were given normal colostrum for three days. Following this period of colostrum feeding all the calves were given twice daily photolised milk (previously heated to 73°C.) at a rate 10 per cent according to body weight. They were also given vitamin A oil in Soyalecithen. Calf R in addition to the photolised milk, received 2.99 mg
226 ABSTRACTS [Vol. XX, Part III of crystalline riboflavin. Once every week the calves were weighed and 24 hours urinary samples in Hcl solution were collected for riboflavin assay. During experimental period of 12 weeks it was noticed that all the calves except R began to consume their feed less from 4th week and consequently lost in weight. Intermittent diarrhoea, dry scaly dermatitis, alopecia, periodic excessive salivation also appeared in them. Postmortem examinations showed catarrhal enteritis, mild oedma of lungs, pebbled cornea and spotted kidney. The addition of 2 mg. of crystalline riboflavin brought recovery in them. Calf R which was receiving 2.99 mg. riboflavn from the start, showed standard rate of growth. Blood vitamin A and ascorbic acid was normal but the urinary excretion of riboflavin was low in all the calves except R. From the data of analysis of urinary excretion it was concluded that minimum daily riboflavin requirement is 75 per kilo body weight. So riboflavin deficiency during milk feeding is not possible.

Fifty three collections from 8 bullsSeptember, 1950] ABSTRACTS 227 The results indicate that the threshold dose for follicular response in the goat is of the order of 600 I.U. Doses below 1000 I.U. often failed to produce oestrous. Ovulation was obtained with a dose as low as 200-400 I.U. and super ovulations with higher doses. Out of 139 eggs shed.87 were recovered. There is also an indication that though there is an equal chance of finding a few medium and large follicles the ovary during anoestrus, the probability of spontaneous ovulation is small. In another breeding experiment, heat was induced in 35 out of 44 goats with a single dose of 1200 I.U. Ten animals from this series conceived and gave birth to youngs. (S.N.L.)

The production and Utilization of Silage ORIGINAL ARTICLES THE NUTRITIVE VALUE OF THE INDIGENOUS GRASSES OF ASSAM III. THE SEMI-AQUATIC GRASSES AS CATTLE FEEDS By S. K. TALAPATRA, U. P. College of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry, Mathura (Received for publication on 19 January 1950) IN our previous communication [Talapatra, et. al. 1949], we have shown that the aquatic grasses could be most profitably utilised for feeding cattle in the form of hay, as green feeding leads to considerable worm trouble. In view of the acute shortage of fodder in the country, it has been considered desirable to utilise some of the semi-aquatic grasses. An attempt has been made in the present paper to study whether these grasses, which grow profusely in most of the low-lying areas, should find a place in the dietary of cattle in this part of the country. Of the various semi-aquatic grasses, the Leersia hexandra commonly known as arali and Arundo donax, Linn., known as nal seem to grow in abundance. Leersia hexandra is a leafy fodder, 60 to 120 cm. long, slender, leaf blades errect, looks more or less like Cynodon dactylon (Dub.) ; while nal is a quick growing grass and a prolific yielder. The latter can be compared with any of the high yielding grasses like Napier (Peniseutum purpureum), jowar (Sorghum vulgare, Pers.), etc. They are perennial and flower during the months of November and December. They cannot be destroyed or eradicated easily once they get set and can be seen from time immemorial in the various semi-aquatic zones, inspite of rough grazing by wild herbivorous animals. The grass arali as a cattle feed Although it is available in large quantities in many parts of the province, considerable practical difficulty is experienced in cutting the grass from a marshy place which makes the concern wholly unprofitable at least during the monsoon months. During the month of November, the fields are dried up, it is possible to cut any quantity of the grass without difficulty and by January, like most of the indigenous grasses in Assam, it dies up. The period is therefore, short and if at all it is to be used as a cattle feed, it should be fed both as a green fodder and as a hay. Accordingly, a big uniform plot was selected, half the grass was turned into hay by the well known tripod system, while the rest was fed as a green fodder, which con- tained on an average about 35 per cent dry matter. (a) As a green fodder (just flowering) Adult animals of 500 lb. body weight were taken and exclusively fed for a sufficiently long period with the grass which was next followed by a 10-day period of collection.

The heavier animal that is animal No. 5, however, failed to maintain the equilibrium. The calcium and phosphorus balances are negative, as is mostly the case with the indigenous grasses of Assam. (b) The grass arali as a hay When turned into hay by the tripod system, it retains an excellent green colour and is considerably softened. The composition, the dry matter consumption, the digestibility co-efficients and the calcium, phosphorus and nitrogen balances have been shown in the following tables : TABLE V Composition of hay and green arali on dry basis Nutrients Arali hay Arali green per cent Crude protein 6.319 5.825 Ether extract 1.5 2.1 Ash 14.92 16.7 Crude fibre 31.4 28.4 N-free extract 45.86 47.0 Total carbohydrates 77.26 75.4 Nitrogen 1.011 0.932 Calcium 0.146 0.19 Phosphorus 0.135 0.145 The hay is, therefore, almost identical in chemical make up with that of the green grass.

In the present experiment, the hay was fed to 4 adult animals as an exclusive feed for a sufficiently long period which was followed by a 10-day period of collection.

The hay as compared to the green arali As a result of a fairly large number of trials, it has been observed that in the hot and humid climate of Assam, it is extremly difficult to preserve the original nutritive value of the grass when it is turned into hay. A sort of slow fermentation takes place in the stack which appears to be responsible for the poor protein digesti- bility. In the present case, the grass was dried in the fields up to 60 per cent dry

It may be mentioned that about 119 and 117 gm. of digestible protein were required to effect a positive nitrogen balance under green and hay feeding experiments respectively for animals of about 500 lb.

December, 1950] S. K. TALAPATRA 237 The digestibility coefficients of nal hay may be regarded as unsatisfactory, specially when the content of protein in the hay was about 9 per cent. The protein digestibility is definitely low and the very low crude fibre digestibility indicates that the grass is considerably lignified even at the prime stage. The starch value of the hay is only about 13.7 lb. per 100 lb. of the material. It is, therefore, not worth feeding the grass in the form of hay even at the prime stage.

TALAPATRA 239 The digestibility figures shown above indicate that the early-cut ' nal ' (mostly shoots) is a valuable cattle feed. The crude protein digestibility seems to be very high. The buffaloes in this part, it seems, travel great distance in search of these shoots. However, such high digestibility coefficients have recently been reported by Maymone [ 1945 ] working with fig leaves (Ficus carica, L.). According to this investigator, fig leaves containing 33 per cent dry matter showed digestibility co- efficients of 72, 38, 69 and 81 per cent of crude protein, ether extract, crude fibre and N-free extract respectively. The protein content of the sample on dry matter basis was 13 per cent and the starch value as determined by Kellners' method was 17.5 per cent per 100 kg. of the fresh fig leaves. In the present case, however, with the early cut ' nal ' the net energy value of Kellner was found to be 15 lb. per 100 lb. of the fresh shoots.

240 INDIGENOUS GRASSES OF ASSAMTHE NUTRITIVE VALUE OF THE INDIGENOUS GRASSES OF ASSAM IV. THE HILL GRASSES AS CATTLE FEEDS By S. K. TALAPATRA, U. P. College of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry, Mathura (Received for publication on 19 January 1950) WHILE a great scarcity of cattle feeds is almost invariably to be experienced du- ring the major part of the year for domestic animals in this part of the country, the tall and quick growing grasses in the lower regions of the Himalaya continue to supply thousands of wild herbivorous animals like buffaloes, rhinos, etc., with foods enough for their growth, maintenance and reproduction. The robust skeletal formation of the wild cattle and buffaloes is apparent, while useful animals in the plains of Assam suffer from mineral deficiency and are very dwarf in size. In our previous communications, we have shown that the aquatic grasses [ Talapatra et al., 1949 ], predominant species of the pasture grass [ Talapatra, 1950 ] and some of the semi-aquatic grasses [Talapatra*, 1950] though appear to be poor in calcium and phosphorus, could be profitably introduced in the dietary of cattle in various forms. Information on the nutritive value of some of the pre- dominant species of the indigenous hill grasses is lacking. The fact that a con- siderable portion of the state is covered by hills and the ranches stationed in these hills and hillocks seem to provide the best cattle, it has been considered desirable, to study some of the hill herbages. During the course of our survey, it has been observed that the predominant species, which are eaten in large quantities by wild animals, are of two kinds com- monly known as dhus (Eraianthus longsetosus Anderss. ex Bth) and kharika (Micro tegium ciliatum A. Camus). These are used by the wood cutters as also by the ranchers for feeding cattle. They normally grow in a moist but not water-logged soil between 200 to 6,000 feet or beyond. I. The grass dhus as a cattle feed It is a tall-growing perennial grass, grows to a height of about 15 to 20 ft. Several cuttings can be obtained. The leaves are broad and soft which look like young maize leaves. It is available in considerable quantities in most of the Assam hills from May upto the end of January, when it begins to flower and shortly after flowering, it dies up and new shoots appear almost simultaneously. It is eaten in large quantities by wild buffaloes, as seen by their excreta in the natural planta- tion of the grass. During early growth, about 4 feet from the bottom and at the later stage about 4 feet from the top were fed to cattle to ascertain the nutritive value of the grass. It is true that these uncultivated grasses cost nothing, but in view of the transport * These references refer to the articles now printed in these series. 241 C

The record of body weight and other relevant data are shown in the following tables : TABLE X Body-weight of the experimental animals Animal number Age at start Weight before the experiment (lb.)

It may be seen from the data in Table X that in two months time, the animals gained on an average about 45 lb., that is, slightly less than a pound per day. The experi- mental period is short but our object is not to study the growth rate of the animals but the efficiency of utilisation of the nutrients of the grass as determined by measur- ing the digestibility coefficients and mineral balance studies during the active period of growth. One animal, however, failed to grow at the desired rate.

For the sake of con- venience, the average digestibility data are shown below : TABLE XV Average digestibility coefficients with young and mature animals (dhus grass feeding) Nutrients 4 Feet from the bottom (early cut) 4 Feet from the top (late cut) Mature bullocks Mature bullocks 1½ year old calves Crude protein 52 52 40 Ether extract 33 27 38 Crude fibre 63 66 59 N-free extract 65 60 56 Total carbohydrates 64 62 54 It appears from the above data that the young animals showed lower digest- ibility coefficients. The protein content of the sample fed to calves was about 8 per cent less than the one fed to bullocks, even then the digestibility should have been more. When bullocks were taken as experimental subjects, the grass was fed as a single feed, while with calves, protein rich concentrates were used to provide growth ration, as the calves declined in weight on an exclusive feeding of the grass. The digestibility data shown above may, therefore, indicate that either the calves actually digested less or there might be some associated effect of other feed nutrients, D
250 INDIGENOUS GRASSES OF ASSAMDecember, 1950] S. K. TALAPATRA 251 note that the urinary calcium under this diet was about 0.5 gm. per day, while under similar conditions with the mature bullocks, the same figure was as high as 2 gm. When large quantities of the mineral are found in the urine, the animal organisms should have a chance to utilise it for skeletal formation, but as adult life requires but little for calcification, the major portion of such absorbed calcium is likely to be thrown off in the urine; such a state of affair may possibly throw some light on the availability of calcium from any feeding stuffs, the conditions of which are perhaps indissolubly connected with each fodder. However, this is a subject which has not been clearly understood, for under acidosis also calcium excre- tion in urine of adult animals may be quite high. The phosphorus retention, how- ever, is a bit unexpected. Since concentrates contributed the largest share, it is highly probable that excess of this nutrient has been stored in the body in organic combination. (d) Conservation of the grass dhus. The grass was conserved both in the form of hay and silage. The hay was not much relished, on an average about 1 lb. per 100 lb. body weight was consumed. For obvious reasons the metabolism experi- ments were abandoned. The stem, which normally remains soft when green, be- comes very tough and hard on drying and such stuffs are rarely eaten by cattle in large quantities. The silage made out of the grass at the prime stage was con- sumed at the rate 1.5 lb. per 100 lb. of body weight. Metabolism experiments were conducted to test the nutritive value of the silage and the relevent data are shown in the following tables: TABLE XVII Dry matter and crude protein digestibilities Animal number Intake (gm.)

It is highly probable that these grasses, which normally induce a neutral urine reaction followed by high urinary calcium, provide conditions favourable for better assimilation of the mineral, which is perhaps ultimately responsible for the robust skeletal formation in wild life. SUMMARY As a result of a fairly extensive survey it is found that the grass Microstegium ciliatum A. Camus (kharika) and Erianthus longisetosus Anderss. ex Bth. (dhus), particularly the latter, constitute the principal roughage of the wild herbivorous animals during the major part of the year in Assam. They are also used by the ranchers and wood-cutters as cattle feeds. Dhus is a tall growing grass, looks like maize or jawar (Sorghum vulgare, pers.) at the early stage and available in considerable quantities from May right upto the end of January, while kharika in edible form for a short duration in monsoon. The early cut dhus at 4 feet height contains about 8 per cent of protein and is almost identical in chemical composition with its late cut tops. The other variety (kharika) is of inferior type and hardly contains about 6 per cent of protein at the prime stage. Metabolism experiments with young and adult animals indicate that in Decem- ber before flowering, the tops show almost similar digestibility coefficients with the early cut dhus grass. The mature bullocks seem to digest the tops from dhus grass more efficiently than the young ones. The other grass kharika, which is considered more valuable by the indegenous people, provides a bare maintenance ration. Though appear to be poor in calcium and phosphorus, both the grasses provide a maintenance ration in these mineral elements when fed ad lib and show a neutral urine reaction with litmus indicator. About 15 to 20 per cent of the ingested calcium is found in the urine. Rapidly growing calves are found to store about 40 per cent of the ingested calcium in the case of dhus grass. All these experiments tend to show that by inducing either a neutral or slightly acidic urine, these grasses create conditions favourable for better absorption of calcium from the gut.

BY S. K. TALAPATRA, U. P. College of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry, Mathura (Received for publication on 19 January 1950) THOUGH hay making appears to be a simple process and a sort of routine work in some of the drier regions of the country, it is by no means an easy affair in the hot and humid climate of Assam where the average rain-fall is over 70 in. and relative humidity above 70. However, in contrast with some of the States, where natu- ral or pasture grasses do not seem to grow well without irrigation which costs money, conditions appear to be most favourable for the growth of the uncultivated grasses and they grow profusely in many parts, particularly in the low-lying areas of the province. Immediately after the few showers of rain in April/May, indigenous grasses of various descriptions begin to grow. During the full swing of monsoon in June, July and August, they grow considerably and a large supply is available for hay making. Towards the end of September, when the weather is partly favourable, some of the indispensable nutrients are lowered due to progressive maturity [Tala- patra et al. 1949], while by October/November, as the weather conditions appear to be favourable for hay making, some of these grasses are to be seen in flowers. During the months of December and January, most of the areas dry up and grass becomes scarce and practically little is available for conservation. In the present paper, an attempt has been made to evaluate indigenous grasses when turned into bay under a variety of conditions. The well-known tripod system of hay making as recommended by [Wright 1937] has been adopted, which may be described as follows: Three poles are fixed in an inclined position so that they meet the surface of the earth forming an equilateral triangle. The free ends of the poles are tied together so as to form a cone. In between the poles, a sort of vent is constructed on the ground which allows air to pass right through the centre up to the other extremity of the tripod when the stack is complete. Three such vents are required to fill up the empty space of the tripod. The poles of the tripod are then tied up at convenient points by means of strings, which give the appearance of a triangle round the poles. In the actual process, the vent is constructed with galvanised corrugated iron sheets over a wooden frame which is adjustable. The shape of the 257

Though the percentage of crude protein was lowered by almost half due to progessive maturity in November when Hay No. III was made, yet possibly due to favourable weather conditions, the digesti- bility of this nutrient was quite high compared to those prepared in monsoon. The data, therefore, indicate that under monsoon conditions in Assam, much of the protein present in the hay is perhaps converted into humin like substances containing nitrogen but not digestible in the animal body and that the tripod system appears to be less effective under the conditions. The multiple air vent system of hay making In order to cope with the monsoon conditions, as is experienced in Assam, the tripod system was modified. A number of cross vents made of bamboo splinters were placed in double rows under a shade. And as usual the grass was dried upto 50 to 60 per cent dry matter and then spread thinly and evenly over a battery of air vents covering a larger area. In this way considerable quantities of the grass were dried. It may be mentioned that four different species of the indigenous grass were tried under conditions similar to that experienced in the tripod system. The grass appears to dry up much more quickly than the tripod system. The hay retained in some cases an excellent green colour so as to supply carotene during the scarcity period. The grass thus dried was much relished by cattle and they consumed at the rate of about 2.5 lb. per 100 lb. of body weight, except of course, the nal hay which
260 INDIGENOUS GRASSES OF ASSAMDecember, 1950] S. K. TALAPATRA 261 It appears from the data shown in Table III that regardless of weather condi- tions, the hay prepared at any time during the year provides above 3 lb. of digestible protein, which is more than a maintenance ration for mature animals weighing only about 400 to 500 lb. in this part. It is, however, interesting to note that uridal grass makes an excellent quality hay, the loss being only about 11 per cent. It may be mentioned that this grass does not contain any spongy pith like the dal grass and seems to dry up very quickly because of its thin leaf-blades and hollow stem. Moreover, the grass contains about 25 to 30 per cent dry matter, while the other monsoon grasses about 15 to 20 per cent. The uridal grass seems to retain an excellent green colour and thus according to Maynard [Maynard, 1948] it should contain enough of carotene. It is, therefore, highly significant from the data that the success of monsoon hay depends to a considerable extent on the selection of the grass. When the weather becomes favourable in November/December, the content of protein is lowered and even then, the hay from the grasses at this period is superior to any straw and provides a maintenance ration, as has been shown earlier [Talapatra, 1950]. The starch equivalent of the hays The net energy value as calculated by Kellner's fibre method is shown below. It may be seen from the data that the starch value has not been much affected by either of the methods of hay making and agree fairly well with the average Indian hays as recorded by [Sen, 1937].

262 INDIGENOUS GRASSES OF ASSAMCOMPOSITION OF MILK OF INDIAN ANIMALS II. EFFECT OF PRESERVATIVES ON THE FREEZING POINT OF MILK By R. VENKATESHWARA RAO, NOSHIR N. DASTUR AND C. S. DHARMARAJAN, Indian Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 19 May 1950) It is customary to use only fresh samples of milk for the determination of the freezing point, as the development of acidity and addition of preservatives to milk lowers the value and thus leads to uncertainty in results. However, a survey of the freezing point of milk produced in different parts of the country was to be made and this was feasible only if the samples could be preserved for fairly long periods. Though preservatives are commonly used for preserving milk to be tested in the laboratory, so far no systematic work seems to have been carried out with a view to ascertain the one most suited for samples to be tested by the freezing point method. For this reason, an attempt has been made to study the action of different preser- vatives on milk with a view to find out the one most suitable. EXPERIMENTAL The freezing point determinations were made with the Hortvet cryoscope using a standard technique [A. O. A. C. 1945]. All the precautions mentioned before [Dharmarajan, Venkateswara Rao, Menon and Dastur, 1949] were taken to check the accuracy of readings. Eleven substances were tried out as preservatives in varying concentrations. The results are shown in Table I. The samples were kept in glass stoppered bottles at room temperature and examined for freezing point and acidity (percentage of lactic acid) at intervals. Trials showed that at the concentrations tried, mercuric perchloride, formalin and potassium dichromate were the only substances suitable for keeping milk in liquid condition for about five days. Formalin and potassium dichromate changed the original value of the freezing point considerably when added; also the values for freezing point were not steady with these preservatives over the interval studied. Mercuric perchloride in the concentration of 0.075 per cent appeared to be the most suitable of the materials studied. Accordingly further trials were carried out with this preservative using different types of milk over a fortnight to find out the correction to be applied to the observed figures. The results are shown in Table II. 263 G

268 COMPOSITION OF MILK OF INDIAN ANIMALSDecember, 1950] RAO, DASTUR AND DHARMARAJAN 269 DISCUSSION Amongst the preservatives tried it was found that borax (0.5 per cent), boric acid (0.5 per cent), formalin (1.0 per cent) hydrofluoric acid (0.25 per cent), 'Iteol' (a patent preparation) 1.0 per cent, sodium fluoride (0.5 per cent), sulfanilamide (0.5 per cent), thymol (1.0 per cent), and toluene (1.0 per cent), were not suitable. With toluene there was no change in freezing point of milk but the milk curdled within 24 hours. Thymol had only a small effect on the freezing point value, but it had hardly any preserving property and had the added disadvantage of not giving a steady value. Borax, boric acid, hydrofluoric acid, 'Iteol', sodium fluoride and sulfanilamide brought about considerable alteration in the original freezing point value and in most cases the value altered further on keeping. Furthermore, the milk curdled within 48 hours. Formalin (1.0 per cent) increased the freezing point of milk considerably and the preserved samples showed varying values on keeping. With formalin it was possible to preserve milk for over 72 hours. With potassium dichromate (0.1 per cent) milk kept well for nearly 96 hours, but this substance also exhibited the same disadvantages as noted for formalin. Mercuric chloride (0.075 per cent) appeared useful for this purpose in that the increase in the freezing point of milk brought about by its addition was moderate. The values soon assumed a constant figure so that it was possible to apply a correc- tion to the preserved samples with a reasonable accuracy. Using the preservative in the concentration 0.075 per cent it was possible to keep the samples in a good condition for over a fortnight. The average correction for the increase in the freezing point depression was 0.019º±0.0019oC. Aschaffenburg, Temple and Veinoglou [1944] recommended a correction of 0.004ºC. for samples preserv- ed with 0.01 per cent mercuric chloride. The correction found in the present studies was smaller. As shown in Table II individual samples of milk have given differences varying from 0.006º to 0.038ºC. SUMMARY Mercuric chloride in the concentration of 0.075 per cent is a good preservative for keeping samples of milk over long intervals for the freezing point test. The average increase in the freezing point depression brought about by the addition of 0.075 per cent mercuric chloride was 0.02ºC. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors wish to thank Dr K. C.

IN-VITRO DIGESTIBILITY OF OILS AND FATS By V. R. BHALERAO, D. VENKATAPPIAH and C. P. ANANTAKRISHNAN, Indian Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 14 April 1950) (With one text figure) FATS and oils form important constituent of the diet of every nation. Informa- tion regarding their relative digestibility will be of great interest. Dastur and Giri [1937] carried out in-vitro digestion experiments on butterfat and oils and shown that ghee is better digested than groundnut or sesame oils. Menezes and Baner- jee [1935] from a similar study have reported that commercial process of refining re- tard the digestibility of oils. Ahmad and Sareen [1946] and Ahmad and Bahl [1946] carried out experiments on the relative digestibilities of common edible oils using pancreatic and ricinus lipase for hydrolysis respectively and found that the digest- ibility of hydrogenated oils and the different lards was very poor as compared to that of cow or buffalo butterfat. Coconut and sesame oils were digested almost at the same rate as cow butterfat. Apart from these investigations, no much informa- tion on the comparative in-vitro digestibility of various oils and fats and hydrogenat- ed fats of Indian origin is available. Hence, the relative digestibility of butterfats of cow, buffalo, goat and sheep, the body fats of the same mammals, the different edible oils and hydrogenated fats has been carried out and the results obtained are presented in this paper. EXPERIMENTAL Collection of fats used for the experiment Samples of genuine ghee from eight different breeds of cattle, viz., Sindhi, Kangayam, Ongole, Gir, Kankrej, Sahiwal Hariana and Murrah buffaloes were collected from Government Dairy Farms at Hosur, Madras, Charrodi, Karnal, Hissar, Montgomery, Delhi and Bangalore. Goat ghee was collected from Hissar, Agra, Trichur, and Chikkodi and sheep ghee from Montgomery, Anand, Sanand and Togh (Kohat). The vegetable oils and body fats were obtained from Madras, Bangalore, Allahabad, Calcutta, Lahore, Karachi and Kanpur through the Agricultural Marketing Adviser to the Govern- ment of India. The hydrogenated edible oils prepared from groundnut, sesame and cottonsee were obtained through the vanaspathi Manufacturer's Association, Bombay. Twenty samples of vanaspathi manufactured by various firms in India were purchased in open market and used for digestion studies. All the fats and oils were stored at 50º F. till they were analyzed. 271 H
272 In-vitro DIGESTIBILITY OF OILS AND FATS [Vol. XX Part IV, Relative digestibility of fats in presence of activator (a) Preparation of pancreatic lipase. Fresh pancreas from the slaughter house were separated from the adhering fatty material and minced well. It was sub- sequently treated with successive quantities of acetone, acetone-ether (1:1) mixture and ether according to the procedure of Willstatter and Waldschmidt-Leitz [1923]. The defatted material was ground to a fine powder and sieved. For preparing the extract 10 gm. of the fine powder was triturated with 60 ml. of 85 per cent aqueous glycerol and shaken for 4 hours at room temperature. The coarse particles were separated by centrifugation and the turbid extract was used for experiment. (b) Digestion trials. The digestion was carried out as follows. A series of test tubes were set up containing 2.0 gm. of fat and 1.0 ml. of buffer (NH3 NH4Cl, pH 9.3). The bile salt used for the present study was Merck's pure sodium tauro- cholate and 1.0 ml. of this solution was added to each test tube. Finally, 10 ml. of the enzyme extract was added and immediately shaken with the hand for three minutes and kept in thermostat at 350.1ºC. The tubes were removed for titra- tion at known intervals and the contents quickly transferred to a flask containing 50 ml. of 95 per cent alcohol, and 10 ml. of ether added. The mixture was titrated against 0.1-N alkali using phenolphthelein as indicator. The results are corrected for the control and are expressed in ml. of 0.1-N alkali required to neutralise the fatty acids in the reaction mixture after a known period of digestion. Four samples of fats were taken at a time with cow ghee as a standard for comparison. Twenty samples of hydrogenated fats from different manufacturers (different brands) were also used for finding out their relative digestibilities. The results are presented in Table I and Fig. 1. DISCUSSION From Fig. 1, it can be observed that the rate of digestion of ghee from buffalo, goat and sheep follow the same trend as cow ghee. The body fats from cow, buffalo, goat and sheep were found to be digested at a lower rate as compared to cow ghee under the same conditions. As the body fats have very high melting points (49.4 to 52.3ºC.) which is perhaps the reason for their lower digestibilities. The oils were found to be better digested than the body fats which confirm the findings from in-vivo experiments carried out by Bhalerao et al. [1947] except in the case of mustard oil, which was found to be poorly digested in in-vivo experiments. Coco- nut oil was found to show equal or even better digestion than cow butterfat by in-vitro experiment. All the vanaspaties prepared from groundnut, cottonseed and sesame oils were digested slightly better than body fats but the digestion rate was significantly poorer as compared to oils from which these were prepared. There appears to be no significance between the vanaspaties of the same origin and having different melting points used in the present experiment as seen from Fig. 1. In general, the rate of digestion of the vanaspaties from groundnut, sesame and cottonseed appears to be almost the same. These observations are confirmed from the results of another set of experiments wherein the rate of digestion of 20 samples of hydro- genated oils are compared with cow butterfat (Table I).

December, 1950] BHALERAO, VENKATAPPIAH AND ANANTAKRISHNAN 275 SUMMARY In-vitro digestion of butterfats and body fats of different mammals, the edible vegetable oils and hydrogenated fats of different melting points were determined using pancreatic lipase. The butterfats of different mammalian species were digested at a better rate than the body fats of the same mammals and the hydrogenated fats of vegetable origin. Butter fats from cow, buffalo, goat and sheep were digested at almost the same rate, and there was not much difference in the digestibility of different edible oils except coconut oil which was found to be digested almost at the same rate as butterfat. Hydrogenation was found to lower the digestibility of oils. There was not much difference in the rate of digestion of different vanaspaties having different melting points.

SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE REACTION OF VACCINATIONS WITH CHICK EMBRYO VACCINE AGAINST RANIKHET (OR NECASTLE DISEASE) BY S. G. DIXIT, Assistant Disease Investigation Officer, Bombay State, Poona (Received for publication on 27 February 1950) VACCINATIONS against Ranikhet disease with chick-embryo vaccine are being undertaken in this province since 1944. Until 1948 vaccine brought from Mukteswar was being used and for obvious reasons the supply was limited as such it was mostly utilised or Government Poultry Farms where semi-ideal if not ideal conditions of poultry husbandry prevail. But from 1948 onwards the province has established its own production centre and any amount of vaccine is made available. It is during this period, vaccinations were undertaken under varying conditions and following is a short summary of observations recorded. The data collected may appear to be scanty but the experience gained is, I feel, certainly valuable from the point of view of reaction of vaccine. In order to avoid misinterpretation of these results, it is necessary to mention here that the author has vaccinated over 20,000 birds so far, since 1947 and reactions of vaccina- tions are most satisfactory when done under normal conditions. Following are the reactions normally observed From third day onwards usually the birds go listless, seek a shady spot, drink water liberally, dose away with half closed eyes, etc. On fifth day onwards a few (about two to three per cent) show lameness which is evinced when the bird spreads its wings out a little to balance itself. After about 10 days the whole outlook is changed and the birds begin to regain appetite, prefer food to shed, lameness gra- dually disappears and the birds appear healthy once more. The reduction in egg yield which varies from 20 to 60 per cent, does not, however, return to normal for about a fortnight to three weeks and there may be one to two per cent deaths. Ins- tances are on-record where there was no reduction in egg yield at all and vaccine has favourably effected on vigour and growth of few having stunted growth. Actual outbreaks. On more than half a dozen occasions, vaccinations were undertaken in actual outbreaks as an experimental measure. The results have varied from unit to unit. They have been more disastrous, when there were no proper segregation arrangements278 SOME OBSERVATIONS ON REACTION OF VACCINATIONS, ETC. [Vol. XX, Part IV, (2) Afford protection to such birds that have escaped infection prior to vaccina- tions. In these instances the reactions were just the same as when the vaccinations are done under normal conditions except for the severity and some mortality. Percentage of mortality ranged between 2 and 100 per cent depending upon: (1) The severity of the outbreak. (2) Number of incontacts offered for vaccinations. (3) Stage of outbreak when vaccinations were carried out. (4) Segregation and other hygienic arrangements on the farm. Deaths amongst vaccinated birds started on 3rd day of vaccination and were maximum between 7th and 10th day whereafter there was gradual fall. There was no mortality after 14th day of vaccination.

December, 1950] S. G. DIXIT 279 Moult. Vaccinations were undertaken when the birds were in heavy moult, and it was observed that the reaction of vaccine had effected a temporary stop in moult which again commenced after the reaction had subsided and had prolonged the period of low egg yield (two to three months) in many cases while in one or two instances the yield had completely gone for a period of three to four months. Nutrition. On one occasion eight per cent of the vaccinated birds out of 453 died during the period of reaction. The birds showed all the typical symptoms of Ranikhet (or severe reaction). Majority of deaths were between 7th and 15th day and the birds involved were three to four months old chicks. Investigations revealed that there was acute shortage of foodstuff during the period of reactions and the birds were on low plain of nutrition (as a matter of fact amounting to starvation). All other comprehensible causes for such mortality as defective vaccine, contamination any other disease, etc., were eliminated. Sudden change in atmospheric condition On one occasion sudden changes (particularly heavy rains) during the period of reaction have effected the vaccination results adversely, the reactions being more severe effecting mortality to the extent of eight per cent. Had the owner not sold out his severely reacting chickens, the percentage of mortality would have gone high. It has also been observed that birds that are kept confined all the time show severe reactions and sometimes considerable percentage of mortality (if crowded) than those that have a free range. Other disease On some occasions reaction of vaccinations have helped other diseases to play an aggressive role which were otherwise dormant. The diseases that have caused untoward results after vaccinations are (1) fowl-pox (2) coccidiosis (3) spirochaetosis. Fowl-pox. Chickens aged eight weeks that looked apparently healthy before vaccinations showed positive lesions of fowl-pox (cutaneous form) during the first week of vaccinations (no history of infection from outside) causing considerable mortality. Coccidiosis. It is another disease that causes losses amongst chicks after vacci- nations with Ranikhet vaccine. The chicks while reacting to Ranikhet vaccine suddenly showed number of immature coccysts in faecal samples and died while another lot of the same age vaccinated with the same brew showed normal reac- tions. Spirochaetosis. This disease was observed to flare up on occasions causing some mortality amongst vaccinated. Cases were suitably treated which perhaps checked many losses. These observations were made during the investigations carried out to find out the cause of untoward reactions of vaccinations. In some cases, however, definite cause could not be ascertained.
CERTAIN ANATOMICAL VARIATIONS By KISHAN SINGH, B.A., L.V.P., Professor of Anatomy, Punjab Veterinary College, Hissar (Received for publication on 9 September 1950) (With Plates IV-IX) THE author came across during the course of intensive dissection work, the following anatomical deviations: Fibula of the ox with a long slender shaft Fibula of the ox usually consists of two extremities only; the head is fused with the lateral condyle of the tibia and is continued below by a small blunt-pointed prolongation. The distal extremity is a separate bone called the lateral malleolus. There has been observed a tibia and fibula of the ox in which the head of the fibula continued by a long slender shaft which reached almost below the middle of the shaft of the tibia. The distal end of the shaft was not fused with the tibia and ended in a fine point; its length on measurement was found to be about six inches, the usual length is about 1 to 1½ inches (Plate IV). An unusual bifurcation of the right anterior laryngeal nerve in the horse Usually the anterior laryngeal nerve passes through the thyroid foramen of the thyroid cartilage as a single branch. It then divides into terminal branches, which ramify in the mucous membrane of the larynx, the floor of the pharynx and the entrance to the oesophagus. In the course of dissection on the subject (horse) it was observed that the right anterior laryngeal nerve before entering the thyroid foramen divided into two branches C and D. This bifurcation took place at a distance of about one centi- meter from the thyroid foramen on the lateral wall of the pharynx. One of these branches (D) passed as usual through the thyroid foramen, the other branch (C) passed over the dorsal border of the lamina of the thyroid cartilage. On further tracing of the C branch, it was observed, that it also supplied the mucous membrane of the larynx, pharynx and anastomosed with the terminal branches of the D (Plate V). The left anterior laryngeal nerve of the same subject did not show any such deviation. Variation in the origin of the left vertebral artery in the horse Vertebral artery on the left side usually arises as an independent branch in front of the deep cervical artery from the left brachial artery. 281 L
282 CERTAIN ANATOMICAL VARIATIONS [Vol. XX, Part IV, Sisson, however, has observed that sometimes the vertebral artery may arise on the left side along with the dorsal and deep cervical arteries by a common trunk. But it was observed while dissecting a pony, that the vertebral artery on the left side was arising from the left brachial by a common trunk with the deep cervical. The dorsal cervical was arising as an independent branch from the left brachial (Plate VI). Peculiar behaviour of the phrenic nerve of the ox The left phrenic nerve usually enters the thorax as a single branch, though it is formed by the union of two or three roots which come from the ventral branches of the 5th, 6th and 7th cervical nerves. It runs its entire course in the mediastinum. It passes over the upper part of the pericardium and runs backward in the posterior mediastinum to reach the tendinous centre of the diaphragm. In the present subject (cow) dissected during the month of February 1941, it was observed, that the left phrenic nerve entered the thorax as a single branch, but as it passed over the pericardium it divided into two branches. There was a considerable interval between them. In the posterior mediastinum, these branches again united and formed a sort of ganglion. The ganglion again divided into several branches to be distributed over the tendinous centre of the diaphragm (Plate VII). An ox with reduced number of cheek teeth Kishan Singh [1939] records a case in which a buffalo cow had no incisor teeth at all, not even in the lower jaw. Careful examination of the part revealed that the teeth in question did no+ erupt from the very birth. In other words this absence was congenital in nature and was strange enough to invoke interest. During the course of further routine demonstration on dissection of the ox, five cheek teeth on either side of the upper jaw were observed instead of the usual six. The condition being unusual its brief description along with brief discussion of the case is given below: The head was carefully examined and the following observations were made: (1) The head belonged to an old animal. (2) The upper cheek teeth on either side were five in number and their crowns were very much worn out, so much so that the lateral roots or fangs of 3rd, 4th and 5th cheek tooth were exposed and stood wide apart showing as if they were separate teeth. (3) That the missing tooth on either side was the first cheek tooth only (1st premolar). (4) No root or em- bedded part of the 1st cheek tooth was felt under the mucous membrane (Plate VIII). The dense connective tissue around the cheek teeth on both sides was carefully dissected out, exposing the bone and following further observations were made: 1. That the bone exposed in front of the second cheek tooth was of uniform colour. 2. That there was no scar or deep coloured mark in front of the second cheek tooth. 3. No embedded part of the 1st cheek tooth was exposed. (Plate IX).

December, 1950] KISHAN SINGH 283 DISCUSSION From the observations made before and after dissection it is clear, that the 1st cheek tooth either temporary or permanent never erupted at all and this absence is congenital, because in any other forms of absence there would have been present either of the following after dissection: 1. Small rudimentary tooth showing that it was a case of retarded eruption, 2. A scar, showing that the tooth was present to begin with and due to some reasons, traumatic or otherwise, it had fallen off and the alveolus got filled up with the granulation tissue and thus presented a scar of deeper colour than the surrounding bone. A perusal of the available literature regarding animal dentition, dental formation and absence of the formation of the dentine tissue shows that there is a great paucity of records on such conditions. Chauveau [1891] states only about the increase of number of cheek teeth in the horse due to the presence of supplementary teeth in front of the true teeth. Sisson [1938] states about the reduction of number of cheek teeth only in breeds of dogs with short faces which may be reduced to 5/7 or in extreme cases to 4/5. Conditions similar to the present one are not quite uncommon in the human being. Colyer and Sprawson [1931] record the absence of molars as a congenital defect. Such cases are those of retarded eruption associated with their subsequent atrophy and total disappearance. Bennet [1931] states that the absence of molars and incisors may be due to a congenital absence of the requisite tooth building material in a body or failure of the tooth germ to calcify. He adds, that the failure of the calcified tooth to erupt may be due to any one of the following causes, such as impaction due to slight mis- placement of the tooth, total misplacement of the formed tooth, new growths such as cysts or traumatic dislocation of the forming tooth. Injury and death of the developing tooth from trauma or sepsis has been known to occur in the human being. Necrosis of bone tissue may occur in certain infectious fevers and in bismuth poisoning. In such cases all the tooth germs may be destroyed and the dead portions are sequestrated or sloughed off. Whatever be the nature of the etiological agent it is clear that the absence in this case is due to some congenital defect. REFERENCES Chauveau, A., (1891).

ABSTRACTS The Effect of Prepartum Vitamin A Supplementation on the Health and Performance of the Young Calf. A. A. SPIELMAN, H. D. EATON, J. K. LOOSLI AND K. L. TURK (1949). J. Dairy Sci., 32, (4) 367 THESE investigations were conducted on 59 cows divided into four dietary groups. The control group received daily a ration of clover and timothy hay, corn silage and the grain mixture. The other three groups were fed, in addition to the basal ration, 1 million I. U. of vitamin A daily, 30 days prior to parturition in the form of alfalfa leaf meal, the alcohol form of vitamin A and the ester form of vitamin A respectively. The calves born were reared according to the dry-calf starter method, and their performance was studied from birth to four weeks of age. Carotene and vitamin A values in the blood plasma of calves from dams fed either alcohol or ester form of vitamin A were significantly higher, during the experimental period than calves from the control dams or those fed alfalfa leaf meal. Also plasma of calves from cows fed the alcohol form of vitamin A was significantly higher in carotene levels than that of claves from dams receiving ester form of vitamin A. Calves from dams fed vitamin A as either ester or alcohol made higher live-weight gains than those from the other two dietary groups. Calves from dams fed alfalfa leaf meal were heavier in live-weight than calves from control dams. The incidence of scours was significantly lower in calves from dams fed either form of vitamin A than that observed in calves from basal dams. Claves from dams fed alfalfa leaf meal had significantly fewer days of scour than calves from the control dams. There were no significant differences in the feed consumption by various groupings. (R.S.) Comparison of Methods of Estimating Milk and Fat Production in Dairy Cows. M. H. ALEXANDER AND W. W. YAPP (1949). J. Dairy Sci., 32, (7) 621 THIS study was undertaken to develop a method of estimating milk and fat production in cows that will lessen the amount of time and labour required than the standard 1-day test every month, now in use. Altogether 684 milk and butterfat records, based on the standard monthly best were used as source of data for this investigation. These records included only the first 305 days of the lactation period. All records of less than 305 days and those showing indications of abnor- malities were discarded. Various groups of test periods within these records were tried to devise new methods. The four methods that gave sufficiently accurate results were: (1) tests taken every other month, (2) tests taken in the 2nd, 6th and 10th months, (3) tests taken in the 2nd and 10th months, (4) tests taken in the 4th and 8th months. In no case, in these methods, was any test used that was taken earlier than the first full month of lactation. Their order of dependability, as compared to the standard monthly test was found to be as follows: (1) 92.84 per cent, (2) 92.26 per cent, (3) 87.59 per cent, (4) 85.52 per cent. Of these methods, testing bi-monthly was the 285 N
286 ABSTRACTS [Vol. XX, Part IV, most dependable, though it was slightly less so than testing every month. Method (2), wherein the tests were taken three times during the lactation was found to be practically as accurate as bi-monthly testing. However, testing only twice during the lactation also gave sufficiently accurate results, to recommend its use, under conditions where it is difficult to obtain frequent tests. (R.S.) The Influence of Tocopherols and Cod-liver Oil on Milk and Fat Production. FRANK WHITING, J. K. LOOSLI, VALDMIR N. KRUKOVSKY AND K. L. TURK (1949). J. Dairy Sci., 32, 133 EXPERIMENTS have been designed to study the effect of cod-liver oil and tocopherol on milk and fat production of dairy cows. Sixteen cows in four groups were fed successively on control ration, on control ration with 1 gm. of mixed natural tocopherols, on control ration with 5 oz. of veterinary grade cod-liver oil and on control ration with 1 oz. tocopherols and 5 oz. cod-liver oil for a period of four weeks on each ration. Feeding 1 gm. to tocopherols increased slightly but not significantly the fat test, the average daily milk and fat yield and the daily yield of 4 per cent fat-corrected milk. The increase of 27 per cent in fat test obtained by others on feeding 1 gm. tocopherol daily over a 20-month period could not be con- firmed. Feeding 5 oz. of cod-liver oil alone or with 1 gm. tocopherol registered a 14 per cent decrease in fat test but an increase of 6 per cent in daily milk yield is reported for the first time. Feeding tocopherol simultaneously with cod-liver oil could not offset the drop in the fat test due to cod-liver oil feeding. The tocopherol content of the milk fat and blood plasma was increased by feeding tocopherols but was decreased by feeding cod-liver oil. Cod-liver oil had a depressing effect on the carotene content of milk fat and blood plasma but this could be prevented to some extent by supplementing with tocopherol. On the other hand, vitamin A content of milk fat and blood plasma was increased by cod- liver oil feeding. (A.K.) The Use of Dried Skim Milk in Bread-making. S. VAN DAM, R. ABMA AND J. G. RAVALLIER-WARFFEMINS (1948). Netherlands Milk and Dairy J. 2, 148 SKIM milk bread stays fresh longer, has a higher nutritive value and is softer than water bread. The colour of the crust of the former is also finer brown and its crumb has a fine creamy colour. Above all it solves to a great extent the problem of utilising surplus skim milk, However, the claims of the American workers that the size of skim milk bread is larger, could not be substantiated by the authors. Of the different fractions of skim milk, the case in compound as found in milk had a significant depressant effect on the size of the milk bread, while calcium caseinate caused an improvement of the baking quality. By using this compound for bread making, only 1/3 of skim milk was utilized but with the addition of 1.5 to 2 per cent fat, 1 to 2 per cent dextrose and 0.004 per cent potassium bromate to the dough of skim milk bread, a more superior loaf than the water bread was obtained. Heating the skim milk either at 100ºC. for 30 minutes, at 110ºC. for 20 minutes or at 120ºC. momentarily could improve the quality of the baked loaf. In using skim milk powder for bread making, the size of loaf was not diminished by suitably preheating the skim milk. (A.K.)
December, 1950] ABSTRACTS 287 Milk Condensing. W. P. CROCKER (1950). J. Soc. Dairy Tech. 3, (2) 110-114 THE author has given a review containing the latest imformations about the manufacture of the two forms of condensed milks viz., the sweetened variety and the unsweetened or evaporated one. For sweetened condensed milk the manu- facturing cycle comprises of (a) the preheating of the raw milk, (b) the addition of sugar (c) the condensing of the sweetened mixture and (d) the cooling of the condensed milk. The purpose of preheating is to kill the pathogenic and other undesirable organisms, and to inactivate those enzymes causing spoilage of the condensed milk. As a relatively severe preheating has a stabilizing effect (which reduces the tendency of the condensed milk to thicken progressively after manufacture), in the present commercial practice the preheating process may range from 180ºF. with a long holding time, to momentary heating to 212ºF. (or even higher) according to circumstances. The same is carried out in continuous units288 ABSTRACTS [Vol. XX, Part IV, samples to reach the end of their oxidation-induction periods, as found from graphi- cal data. The oxidation tests were made under two conditions: (a) a practical test at 38ºC. ('Indian Summer Temperature') for 4-8 months and (b) an accelerated test at 100ºC. (Swift oxidation tester). The keeping property of ghee was only slightly influenced by the type of culture (dahi, L. bulgaricus and L. acidophilus) used for souring though the flavour was markedly influenced. It was not affected by differences in initial acidity from 0.17 to 0.90, initial moisture content and souring of milk to give 2.5 to 3.0 per cent lactic acid. The heat treatment was found to be the most important factor affecting the keeping property of ghee as it improved with the higher final temperature of clarification of butter (110º-150ºC.) provided the heating was conducted rapidly, in contact with the curd and with a minimum amount of stirring. The authors con- sider the improvement to the due to the antioxidants (apparently phospholipids) extracted from the curd during heating at higher temperatures as heating of butterfat with 1 per cent egg-yolk to 110º and 130ºC. promoted increase in oxida- tion-induction periods. They also suggest that high temperatures in addition to favouring the incorporation of phospholipids might also convert other substances into antioxidants. The rate of oxidation at 100ºC. by the 'Swift oxidation tester' is shown to predict with fair accuracy the storage life of ghee at 38ºC. (P.D.) The Types of Bacteria Commonly Found in Farm and Creamery Water Supplies and their Action on Milk and Milk products. S. B. THOMAS (1949). J. Soc. Dairy Tech. 2, (4) 224-232 ABOUT 170 species of bacteria have their natural habitat in fresh water but only half of this number is encountered in the routine bacteriological examina- tion. The natural microflora of water is composed of the species of Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium and Microccocous. These organisms are quite distinct from the bacilli and actiomysetes washed in with soil, and also from the intestinal and sewage organisms found in polluted water. Bacterium aerogenes, B. cloacae, B. coli, and Alcaligenes Viscosus have often been found responsible for the outbreaks of ropiness in farm milk and the causative organisms have been isolated from water used for washing dairy utensils or from streams or ponds to which cattle have access. Large numbers of coliform bacteria may also be introduced when polluted surface-water is used for washing butter. B. aerogenes and Intermediate types of coliform bacteria grow rapidly in unsalted butter held at 15ºC. and above, and produce objectionable odours and flavours. At refrigeration temperatures fairly rapid proteoloytic and lipolytic spoilage of milk, cream, butter and cheese are brought about by the faculatative psychrophilie bacteria which are often found in appreciable numbers in polluted surface-waters. The majority of the lipolytic bacteria that hydrolyse milk fat and produce rancidity in cream, butter and cheese are gram-negative rods of the genera Pseu- domonas, Achromobacter, Flavobacterium and Alcaligenes, generally found asso- ciated with surface-water.

B., THOMAS, BLODWIN F., THOMAS, AND ELLISON, DOROTHY, (1949). Dairy Indust., 14, 921 THIS paper deals with the incidence of psychrophilic bacteria i.e., those bac- teria which grow well at temperatures below 15ºC., in different types of milk supplies. The samples analysed included raw milk from farm, from bulk tanker and commercially pasteurised milk. The psychrophilic count determined by plating on yeastrel milk agar and incubating for 28 days at 3º-5ºC., were highest in bulk tanker milk, 96 per cent of samples showing more than 10,000 bacteria per ml. while in raw milk from farms and in commercially pasteurised milk, the incidence was 75 and 37 per cent respectively. The keeping quality of milk at 3º-5ºC. assessed by a clot- on-boiling test of corresponding samples was poor for bulk tanker milk, all of them clotting within 10 days while 23 per cent of farm milk supplies and 69 per cent of commercially pasteurised milk did not caogulate even after 14 days. These three types of samples when pasteurised in the laboratory in 10 ml. quantities showed no psychrophilic counts and kept 'sweet' for more than 21 days at3º-5ºC. Unsterilised utensils like milking pails, receiving pans, cooler or churn, contributed to the sys- chrophilic count of raw milk. Only on one case did asceptically drawn milk show psychrophiles. In bottled milk also, the bottle filler and bottle were the chief sources of psychrophiles, the hot milk from the holder showing no psychrophilic counts while the cooler contributing only in one instance. The importance of these findings have been discussed. (V.K.N.N.)

ANANTAKRISHNAN, Indian Dairy Research Institute, angalore (Received for publication on 21 June 1948) THE relative nutritive value of oils and fats is generally judged by their digestibi- lity and the relative rates of absorption. With regard to the former, a number of investigations have been carried out from time to time. Deuel and co-workers [1921], Langworthy et al. [1915] and Langworthy [1923] have carried out experi- ments with human subjects to determine the digestibility of various fats and found that most of the fats were utilised almost to the fullest extent in the human body and the digestibility coefficient of fats having melting points above body tempera- ture varied inversely with their melting points. McCay and Paul [1938] determined the digestibility of cottonseed oil and of hydrogenated vegetable oil in experiments with rats and found that there was practically no difference in their digestibilities. Hoagland and Snider [1942] have compared the digestibilities of lard, vegetable shortenings and mixed vegetable and animal shortenings using rats and found that the digestibility of lard is higher than that of the two types of shortenings. Roy [1944] found by the balance sheet method that excepting groundnut oil, the per- centage of absorption of oils decreased when subjected to thermal treatment. Basu and Nath [1946] have also determined the digestibility of butterfat, mustard oil, coconut oil, sesame oil, groundnut oil and hydrogenated groundnut oil on human beings. They found that there is no great difference in the digestibilities of oils and fats of vegetable and animal origin which are liquid at ordinary temperatures. The results with vanaspati indicate slightly lower value. Nhave and Patwardhan [1945] studied the rat's absorption of different fats when consumed on an empty stomach by adult males and obtained maximum absorption 2 to 3 hours after ingestion in the case of butter ghee and coconut oil, while groundnut and sesame oils showed slower rates of absorption. Misra and Patwardhan [1948] studied the digestibility of hydrogenated vegetable oils and noticed that the digestibility of hydrogenated groundnut oil (m.p. 29.5ºC.) did not differ significantly from that of the product with melting point 49ºC. The hydrogenated products containing different propor- tions of iso-oleic acid had the same digestibility as one another and as that of the groundnut oil itself. During some recent investigations on the growth promoting values of butter-fats, body fats, vegetable oils and hydrogenated vegetable oils at this Institute, an attempt was made to investigate their digestibility coefficients and the results obtained are presented in this paper. EXPERIMENTAL The digestibility was determined on adult rats which were on the following diet during the experimental period: skim milk powder2 DIGESTIBILITY OF VARIOUS OILS AND FATS [Vol. XXI, Part I, wheat flourMarch, 1951] PAUL, BHALE RAO AND ANANTAKRISHNAN 3 the fæces were completely disintegrated. Fifty ml. of ethyl alcohol was now added and heating was continued until saponification was completed. The contents of the flask were then transferred to a separating funnel and a slight excess of hydro- chloric acid was added. After cooling, the contents of the funnel were extracted exhaustively with 100 ml. portions of petroleum ether. The ether extract was washed with water till free from acid, dehydrated overnight over anhydrous magne- sium sulphate, filtered and the ether distilled off in a tarred dish. The dish was then dried to constant weight at 100°C. The weight of the glycerides was calculated by multiplying the weight of the fatty acids extracted by 1.045. Metabolic fat in the fæces was also determined at the same time. The rats were kept on a fat free diet and after a preliminary period of three days to permit the excretion of all the residual fat from the previous diet, the fæces were collected for a week. The fæces were dried and their fat content was determined in the same way as previously described. The percentage of fat in fæces of rats fed on a fat free diet was considered to be the metabolic fat. The true digestibility of each fat was calculated in the usual manner after making the necessary correction for the metabolic fat. Complete data about the digestibility of one sample is given in Table I. TABLE I Data of the digestibility experiments on cow ghee (Collection period of 7 days) Rat number Food consumed gm.

March, 1951] PAUL, BHALE RAO AND ANANTAKRISHNAN 5 Trial 1 The 14 varieties of fats and oils included in the trial can be grouped into four characteristically different types : (a) Butterfats which consist of (1) and (2). (b) Body fats which consist of (3), (4), (5) and (6). (c) Oils which consist of (7), (8), (9) and(10). (d) Vanaspatis which consist of (11), (12), (13) and (14). The comparison of these 14 varieties can be split up into two main parts, viz. (i) the comparison existing between the four types, and (ii) the comparison existing between the varieties within each type. Since each group of rats fed on a particular fat or oil, was composed of both male and female animals, the design also gives a scope to study the effect of sex, if any, on the digestibility of oils and fats. This consists of comparing the overall effect of the two sexes as also their differential response to the comparison envisaged in (i) and (ii) above. The data consist of percentage figures and to make them amenable to statistical study they are to be initially transformed as follows : If P is the digestibility percentage, the transformed variate Z is given by [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] where Z is expressed in minutes.

6 DIGESTIBILITY OF VARIOUS OILS AND FATS [Vol. XXI, Part I, It can be seen that the mean square due to types is highly significant as compared to the error mean square signifying thereby that there is very strong evidence to conclude that the four different types of fats and oils are essentially of different digestibility. The means of the four different types are given in Table IV. TABLE IV Effect Mean 1. Butter fats 714.05 2. Oils 900.38 3. Vanaspatis 1097.93 4. Body fats 1394.88 The critical difference for the comparison of butterfats with any of the other 3 types works out to be 140.6, whereas that for the comparison of oils, vanaspatis and body fats is 114.8. It will be seen that the butter fats, as a type, have the highest digestibility and body fats the lowest, with oils and vanaspatis as intermediaries, no difference being detectable between the latter two, which, however, differ signifi- cantly from butter fats and body fats. In terms of bar notation which is used for specifying varieties of homogeneous effects, the four types can thus be arranged in an order of decreasing digestibility as follows : 1. Butter fats. 2. Oils. 3. Vanaspatis. 4. Body fats. It can also be seen from the analysis of variance table that although butterfats, vanaspatis and body fats are differing as types, there is no evidence to suggest any heterogeneity within the varieties of each of these types since the corresponding M.S.'s are non-significant. The case is, however, different for oils, the mean square for which comes out to be highly significant. This indicates that the different varieties of oils used in the trial could not be of equal digestibility. If all the 14 varieties of oils and fats used for trial 1 are arranged in a decreasing order of their mean digestibi- lity, the picture will be as shown in Table V.

It may be mentioned that the critical difference for comparing any two varieties of fats and oils works out to be 229.6. It will be seen from Table V that coconut, groundnut and sesame oils do not significantly differ from each other in digestibility, but all of them exhibit significant difference from safflower oil which gives the lowest digestibility among the oils. The significance of oil as a type which has been specified above, can thus be directly attributed to the digestibility of safflower oil as compared to other varieties of oil. Table III also shows that none of the mean square involving sex comparisons, whether it is a main effect or an interaction, is significant. This indicates that both male and female rats are of equal ability in digesting all the 14 varieties of fats and oils and also that different varieties of fats and oils do not appear to affect the two sexes differently. Trial 2 The 10 varieties used in trial 2 can also be grouped into the following 3 types : (a) Butter fats which consist of (1), (2) and (3). (b) Oils which consist of (4) and (5). (c) Vanaspatis which consist of (6), (7), (8), (9) and (10).

They can thus be arranged in the order of decreasing digestibility as given below : 1. Butterfats. 2. Oils. 3. Vanaspatis. The critical difference for the comparison of any two varieties used in this trial works out to be 154.0. The following table gives the arrangements of the 10 varieties of fats and oils in an order of decreasing digestibility, the varieties appearing under the same vertical bar not significantly differing amongst themselves. TABLE VIII The digestibility of fats and oils used in trial 2 in decreasing order Serial number Variety Mean 1 Cow ghee 635.4 2 Goat ghee 760.9 3 Sheep ghee 769.1 5 Cottonseed oil 834.3 4 Mustard oil 847.3 8 Sesame vanaspati (m.p. 37.1°C.) 992.8 10 Cottonseed vanaspati (m.p. 35.5°C.) 1012.4 9 Cottonseed vanaspati (m.p. 37.3°C.) 1034.2 6 Groundnut vanaspati (m.p. 39°C.) 1078.4 7 Sesame vanaspati (m.p. 39.3°C.) 1286.3 It can be seen from Table VI that the mean square due to butterfats has not come out to be significant. This result is similar to that obtained in trial 1, i.e. to say the butterfats used in trial 2 were also of homogeneous digestibility. Since cow ghee was one of the butter fats for both trials 1 and 2 and as the results are not significant for the butter fats for the both the trials, the results for the two trials can be combined to conclude that all the four butter fats used in the two trials, viz. cow ghee and buffalo ghee are not likely to be different in digestibility. Unlike trial 1 where the mean square due to oils was significant, the mean square due to oils in trial 2 is not significant ; in fact it is much smaller than the error mean square. The apparent inconsistency of these results for the two trials may be due to any one or both of the following two reasons : (i) The varieties of oils used in the two trials are different, thus the results for the trials need not be similar.
10 DIGESTIBILITY OF VARIOUS OILS AND FATS [Vol. XXI, Part I, (ii) It has been observed that the significance of the oils as a type in trial 1, can be ascribed to the comparatively low digestibility of safflower oil. Otherwise the oils used in trial 1 were homogeneous. The opposite results in the two trials may thus be due to the inclusion of safflower oil in trial 1. As in the case of oils, the results of significance for vanaspatis are also different in the two trials. It can, however, be seen from Table VIII that of the five vanaspatis used in trial 2, four, viz. sesame vanaspati (m.p. 37.1°C.), the two cotton seed vanas- patis(m.p's. 35.5 and 37.3°C.) and groundnut vanaspanti (m.p. 39.9°C.) are not differ- ing among themselves while the sesame vanaspati (m.p. 39.3°C.) having the lowest digestibility is significantly differing from the above four vanaspatis. It is thus apparent that the significance of the various varieties of vanaspatis in trial 2 was due to the comparatively low digestibility of sesame vanaspati (m.p. 39.3°C.). It can further be seen that in trial 2 the sesame vanaspati with the lower m.p., viz. 37.1°C. is of much superior digestibility than the same base vanaspati with the higher m.p., viz. 39.3°C. A similar result is also observed in trial 1, as is revealed by Table V which shows that of the two groundnut vanaspatis the one with the lower m.p., 34.1°C., is of higher digestibility than the one with the higher m.p., 37°C. These may be taken as indications to suggest that for the same base oil the digestibility of its hydrogenated form falls down with an increase in melting point. But such a contention does not hold in the case of cottonseed oil since the two varieties of cottonseed vanaspatis with m.p. 35.5°C. and 37.3°C. have not exhibited any significant difference between themselves (vide Table VIII). On the other hand, it is to be observed that the difference in the m.p's. of the sesame vanaspatis or of the two groundnut vanaspatis is greater than that between the m.p's. of the cotton seed vanaspatis. This may, wholly or partially, be the reason for the significant difference between the sesame and groundnut vanaspatis as against the non-significant difference between the cottonseed ones. The difference in results of significance for groundnut and sesame vanaspatis on the one hand and cottonseed vanaspatis on the other might also very well arise out of some inherent difference between the base oils. In any case there is no sufficient evidence obtainable from these trials to conclusively favour any definite thesis regarding this point. It would be worth- while to study this aspect by taking a greater number of vanaspatis made from the same oil covering a wide range of variation in their m.p's. However, the results indicate that the digestibility of vanaspatis decrease with a rise in the m. p. of the finished product. Unlike trial 1, the effect of sex has been shown significant in some respects in trial 2. Although the main effect of sex is highly non-significant, the interaction between sex X type, sex-x-pils and sex x vanaspatis have exhibited significance. This implies that although on an average the two sexes do not show any difference in digestibility, the response of the two sexes is of an opposite nature for the different types of oils and fats and also separately for different varieties of oils and for different varieties of vanaspatis. The significance of the interaction between sex and oils is of a very high order which places extra emphasis on the differential nature of re- action of sex with different varieties of oils. If the experiments were confined to individual types instead of taking all types together, a different picture might have been obtained.
March, 1951] PAUL, BHALE RAO AND ANANTAKRISHNAN 11 From both the trials it is clear that butter fats from cows, buffaloes, goats and sheep have greater digestibility than oils, vanaspatis and body fats which follow in the order of decreasing digestibility. While all the different butter fats are of almost the same digestibility, among the oils, coconut oil showed the highest digesti- bility and safflower oil, the lowest digestibility. In the case of vanaspatis, the digestibility is influenced by the melting point of the product. The body fats are poorly digested, probably due to their high melting points. This is in close agree- ment with the results of their relative rates of absorption in the 4-hour period where it was observed that they were poorly absorbed as compared to cow ghee. The results, in general, confirm the findings of the previous workers. It can thus be concluded that the natural oils and fats are digested almost to the same extent, except the body fats of high melting points. Vanaspatis can, however, be conveniently used for human consumption, in case, care is taken to see that the hydrogenation is not carried too far to raise the melting point of the product above the body temperature.

MALE BUFFALOES* By N. D. KEHAR and V. N. MURTY, Animal Nutrition Section, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 16 September 1950) THE significance of obtaining an accurate information on the different constitu- ents of blood of domestic animals under normal conditions has been emphasized by Kehar [1940], Kehar et al. [1940], Mullick and Pal [1943], and Kehar and Murty [1945], as an aid in diagnosing the various pathological and metabolic disorders. A systematic study has been undertaken in these laboratories to establish the normal physiological standards for the different species of animals. In this article, observations on the blood constituents of buffaloes are presented. It may be mentioned that buffalo is an important dairy and draught animal in the Middle East, India, Pakistan and South Eastern countries. A perusal of the avail- able literature shows that no systematic work on buffalo blood has so far been attempted, except a few observations on the red blood corpuscles by Norris [1916] and Sankaranarayan [1937]. EXPERIMENTAL Observations were made on 25 apparently healthy adult male buffaloes, during the summer months. The animals were maintained on an adequate diet throughout the experimental period. The hæmatological constituents, namely red blood corpuscles, hæmoglobin, and cell volume and sugar (total reducing substances) were estimated in the whole blood, whereas the inorganic constituents, viz. calcium, inorganic phosphorus, and magnesium, and serum proteins were estimated in the blood serum. Blood was drawn from the jugular vein in the morning before any feed was offered to the animals. Neutral potassium oxalate was used as the anticoagulant and the necessary correction, for the shrinkage of cells, was made while calculating the volume of the packed cells. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The hæmatological constituents were determined by the methods described by Napier and Das Gupta [1945]. The results are presented in Table I, and compared with the corresponding figures for the bullocks of three different breeds. * Read at the Indian Science Congress Session, 1948 held at Patna 13 3

The average value was 79.4±3.10 mg. per 100 ml. Mullick and Pal [1943] reported 80.1 and 88.3 mg. per 100 ml. blood for Hariana and Dhanni bullocks while Kehar and Murty [1945] observed a value of 75.6 mg. per 100 ml. blood. Murty and Kehar [1950] recorded an average value of 88.1 mg. per 100 ml. blood in the case of Kumaoni bullocks. Serum protein. The serum protein was determined by the usual Kjeldahl method and the mean value observed was 7.46 gm. per 100 ml. of blood serum, a value lower than the one reported by Kehar and Murty [1945] for Hariana bullocks, and higher than the figure recorded for Kumaoni bullocks by Murty and Kehar [1950]. Calcium. Calcium was determined by the method of Kramer and Tisdall [1921] as modified by Clark and Collip [1925]. The average calcium content was 10.0±0.09 ranging between 9.4 and 11.0 mg. per 100 ml. of blood serum. A higher value has been recorded for Hariana bullocks by Mullick and Pal [1943] and Kehar and Murty [1945], for Dhanni bullocks by Mullick and Pal [1943] and also for Kumaoni bullocks by Murty and Kehar [1950]. Inorganic phosphorus Estimation of inorganic phosphorus was made by the method of Fiske and Subbarow [1925]. The values varied from 5.76 to 7.84 mg. with a mean value of
16 PHYSIOLOGICAL STUDIES ON THE BLOOD OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS [Vol. XXI, Part I, 6.95±0.05 mg. per 100 ml. sera. This figure is significantly higher than the one reported for Hariana bullocks by Kehar and Murty [1945]. Magnesium The method of Fiske and Subbarow [1925] with the modifications of Holzapfel [1934], was used in estimating the magnesium content of serum. The maximum and minimum values were 3.45 and 2.14 with an average of 2.76±0.10 mg. per 100 ml. of serum. Kehar and Murty [1945] observed 2.78 mg. per 100 ml. of serum in the case of Hariana, while Mullick and Pal [1943] recorded an average figure of 2.40 mg. for Hariana and 2.84 mg. of mg. per 100 ml. of serum for the Dhanni bullocks. Murty and Kehar [1950] noted 2.35±0.11 mg. of magnesium per 100 ml. of blood serum for Kumaoni bullocks. SUMMARY A systematic study of the haematological and inorganic constituents of the blood of different species of domestic animals has been undertaken. This article presents observations on the different physiological blood constituents of the male buffalo. The average values recorded for the different constituents analyzed are as follows : Hemoglobin 7.7±0.22 per 100 ml. blood, red blood corpuscles 6.1±0.16 millions per cubic milli meter, cell volume 35.5±1.26 per cent, mean corpuscular volume 58.4±1.05 cubic microns, mean corpuscular hemoglobin 12.7±0.19 micro micro grammes and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration 21.8±0.40 per cent, sugar (total reducing substances) 79.4±3.10 mg. per 100 ml. blood serum protein 7.46 gm. per 100 ml. serum, calcium 10.0±0.09, inorganic phosphorus 6.95±0.05 and magne- sium 2.76±0.10 mg. per 100 ml. of serum. These values compare favourably with the Kumaoni bullocks which are of non descript type but show interesting differences in the haematological consti- tuents (except the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration), serum protein and inorganic phosphorus, when compared to the pure bred Hariana and Dhanni bullocks.

STUDIES ON VENEZUELA (MELINIS MINUTIFLORA BEAUV) GRASS I. THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF VENEZUELA GRASS AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF GROWTH By J. N. BARUA, N. K. AYYAR, and N. D. KEHAR, Animal Nutrition Section, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 15 February 1950) THE importance of grass in its various forms in the dietary of cattle needs no special emphasis. Various investigations on different fodder grasses show that apart from the dominating influence of factors like soil and climate, the stage of growth of the plant has also an important bearing on the chemical composition and nutritive value [Woodman and Evans, 1935 ; Woodward et al. 1939 ; James and Pratt, 1942 ; Hobbs et al. 1945 ; Schofield 1944, 1945 and 1946 ; and Stapledon, 1947]. Although the flush period of production of different species may differ even under identical conditions of soil and climate, both the nutritive value and palatability are found to be at a higher level in the pre-flowering stage when the cellulose structure of the plant body is not lignified to a great extent. Each species of plant needs separate study under the prevailing conditions to which it is subjected and in the case of grasses it is equally important to know the best period of cutting for hay making. Venezuela grass which is also known as molasses or wynne grass, was first introduced in India by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, and has been successfully grown in many parts of the country, specially in Assam. According to available literature nothing is known about its digestibility co-efficients and nutritive value. In a predominantly agricultural country the selection of a suitable type of fodder grass for cultivation is an important present day problem to provide feeds to the millions of our underfed cattle. The present investigation was under- taken to study the chemical composition of Venezuela as affected by seasonal varia- tions, and also whether this grass could be cultivated as a successful fodder crop in India. Bews [1927] stated that Melinis minutiflora Beauv, molasses grass, is an im- portant fodder grass in the tropics of both hemispheres. In Brazil it is known as 'Capim mellad' (Hackel) or 'Capim gordura' (Warming). It forms a very dense association on very old forest soil giving at the time of flowering, the whole land- scape a reddish brown colour. In Angola it goes under the name of 'Efwatakala grass' and is said to be sought after by domestic animals for fodder and at the same time is considered inimical to the tse-tse fly. It has been during recent years cultivat- ed in Rhodesia and South Africa. In Natal, a hairy variety, 'pilosa stapf' is usually met with. 17 4
18 STUDIES ON VENEZUELA GRASSMarch, 1951] BARUA, AYYAR, AND KEHAR 19 when the number of cuttings was restricted to two from the second plot, the yield was only thirteen tons per acre, i.e. 31.6 per cent less. Chemical composition For studying the chemical composition of the grass at different stages of growth, a narrow strip of grass plot consisting of two to three parallel rows of bushes was set apart at the end of each plot breadthwise and a few bushes were cut here and there at 3 in. above ground level on the first and second day of every month. The stems of the cut bushes were well marked by sticking wooden spikes in the ground near them. Due precaution was taken to avoid recutting the same bushes, as after a few months due to new vegetative growth, the cut bushes also resembled the uncut ones. Thus every month new bushes were selected and cut for analysis which represented respectively the grass at different stages of growth. Monthly samples for analysis were taken for one whole year and estimations were made for their organic and inorganic constituents by the standard methods used in these laboratories. The results of analysis are shown in Tables I and II. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION From a perusal of Table I it may be seen that there is no remarkable variation in the amount of organic matter of the grass from month to month, except that for the first three months there has been a gradual increase. The peak, however, reached in the month of May after which it remained fairly steady. When the organic matter increased there was a corresponding decrease in total ash.

Like calcium, phosphorus and protein, the magnesium content was higher during the early stages of growth when there were fresh develop- ments of tender shoots and leaves. Thus the winter grass was found to be richer in calcium, phosphorus and protein than the summer. Lander [1942] also came to a similar conclusion working on the perennial grasses of the Punjab. As is usually the case, the sodium content of the grass was lower than that of potassium. It showed its variations within a very narrow range. In its rise and fall it rather showed a negative correlation with potassium. The potassium content of the grass showed more regular variations than that of sodium. It had a tide similar to that of protein and phosphorus and the peak values were reached nearly at the same time. The chlorine content of the grass was low. It resembled protein in its rise and fall reaching its peak value in February. The total sulphur content of the grass was negligible and in its rise and fall it also resembled protein. Distribution of different elements in the leaf and stems of the grass at the flowering stage At the flowering stage of the grass a separate leaf and stem analysis was made to study the distribution of various elements. Here the leaf represented the leaf blade as well as the leaf sheath, and stem only the stalk without the leaves. The results are set out in Table III.

22 STUDIES ON VENEZUELA GRASSMarch, 1951] BARUA, AYYAR AND KEHAR 23 SUMMARY Investigations on Venezuela grass were undertaken to study its chemical composition as affected by seasonal variations, and also whether this grass could be cultivated as a successful fodder crop in India. The results are given below : The grass appeared to thrive well in poor acid soil, low in calcium, nitrogen and organic matter without fertilizer applications. If the grass is cut thrice every year the yield is about 19 tons of green herbage per acre, whereas two cuttings gave only about thirteen tons. The chemical composition of Venezuela grass was studied at monthly intervals for one year. The grass came into flower in the first week of April and one month prior to inflorescence, i.e. in February to March the grass contained the highest percentages of all the nutrients. After this there was a gradual decadence of all the nutrients along with maturity. There was a progressive fall of crude protein, ether extract, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, sulphur and oxalic acid with the maturity of the plant. The lime and phosphoric acid contents of the grass were high during the dry winter spell of the year. No marked inverse relationship was shown by them along with maturity. The grass is fairly rich in minerals except calcium. It is rich in phosphoric acid. Cultivation of the grass under proper manurial treatments may further improve the quality yielding a still higher return. REFERENCES Bews, J. W. (1927).

N. BARUA, N. K. AYYAR, and N. D. KEHAR, Animal Nutrition Section, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 15 February 1950) THE chemical composition of Venezuela grass at different stages of growth has already been reported from these laboratories by Barua, Ayyar and Kehar [1951]. In this article the nutritive value of the grass at the preflowering and flowering stages is presented. EXPERIMENTAL The nutritive value of the grass was determined at two different stages of its growth, viz. (1) preflowering stage and (2) the flowering stage. The preflowering sample of the grass represented the September cut during its low period of growth and that of the flowering stage, the April cut when the inflorescence had just emerged. For the purpose of these experiments six locally bred adult male sheep, more or less of the same live weights, age and general condition were selected. The grasses were dried, chopped and fed as hay. The total feeding period covered fifteen days of which the first ten days were regarded as the preliminary period. During the last five days twentyfour hourly collection of excreta were made and analysed by the standard methods used in these laboratories. This period could not be prolonged owing to the fact that only a very limited amount of hay was available for experimentation. In these trials in spite of the fine chopping of the hay the animals by intution showed a special fondness for the tender and leafy portions of the grass and ate a larger proportion of them leaving mostly the stems in the residue. The residues were analysed separately and necessary corrections made in the calculations. The residue left by individual sheep, however, did not differ much among themselves. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In the digestibility trial with the preflowering stage of grass, the chemical composition of the feeding stuffs used and of the hay residues left by the animals is given in Table I. 5 25

It is also evident from the data that two of the animals, Nos. 2 and 12 which consumed proportionately a larger amount of hay, recorded slightly higher positive balances of nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus. Venezuela grass hay (flowering stage) Another digestibility trial of Venezuela hay at the flowering stage of the plant has also been carried out in order to evaluate the grass at this stage of growth. This represented the April cut from the experimental plots just when the inflorescence emerged. Although six animals were selected for the experiment, two of them fell sick at a later stage and, therefore, had to be removed from the experiment. The results obtained with the remaining four are given below. The plan of the experi- ment was the same as in the first case. The chemical composition of the feeding stuffs used, the data on food consumption, the daily excretion of faeces and urine during the experimental period are given in Tables IX, X and XI.

The data on food con- sumption show that the animals consumed a fairly large amount of hay. The average daily consumption of hay was 1306 gm. per 100 lb. live weight, the consump- tion being slightly less than in the first experiment. Sheep Nos. 2 and 7 ate about 3.20 lb. of hay per 100 lb. of live weight. The digestibility coefficients of the nutrients are shown in Table XII. The average digestibility coefficients of organic matter, crude protein, ether extract, crude fibre, nitrogen-free-extract and total carbohydrates were 57.2, 30.9, 13.6, 61.9, 57.9 and 59.7 respectively.

All the animals in both the experiments recorded positive balances of nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus. The retentions of these elements in the preflowering stage were found to be appreciably higher than those of the flowering stage. Hay made at the preflowering stage shows a better nutritive value than at the flowering stage. REFERENCES Barua, J. N., Ayyar, N. K., Kehar, N. D. (1951). Sen, K. C. (1938). I. C. A. R. Misc.

THE DETERMINATION OF THE PERCENTAGE OF EDIBLE FLESH IN THE RHODE ISLAND RED, WHITE LEGHORN AND DESI (INDIGENOUS) COCKERELS AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF GROWTH By T. D. MAHADEVAN and S. BOSE, Poultry Research Section, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, Uttar Pradesh (Received for publication on 16 September 1950) IN India there is, at present, no specialised farm for table poultry production and the birds going to market are mostly by products of egg production. The sale of surplus young male birds is rather seasonal and is a side line to the annual production of pullets. It is a source of profit to the poultry farmer provided the surplus cockerels are disposed off at an age, when the largest net return can be obtained. The present investigation was undertaken to determine the percentage of edible flesh in the Rhode Island Red, White Leghorn and the improved desi cockerels at 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks of age respectively in order to compare the efficiency of the different classes of poultry. EXPERIMENTAL The birds used in the present experiment were from the surplus cockerels left over during the production of replacement stocks in the Institute Farm. They were fed on mash and grain system of feeding and no attempt was made for fattening up the birds. During the first eight weeks, the birds received both groundnut cake meal and separated milk as the protein supplement but from eight weeks onwards only groundnut cake meal was fed as the protein supplement. The birds were killed and bled by dislocating the neck, and were dry-picked immediately after- wards. The distribution of edible and inedible parts of the cockerels of different classes at different stages of growth is shown in Table I. The figures in Table I represent the average results obtained from at least six birds in each case. The percentage of feathers in Rhode Island Reds at eight weeks was found to be about 50 per cent less than in White Leghorns and desis of the same age. Although at later stages of growth the difference was not signi- ficant, up till 16 weeks ' bare backs ' were more pronounced in Rhode Island Reds than in White Leghorns or desis. The problem of feathering in young stock is of great interest as one of the most important quality factors in market poultry is the condition of the body feathering when it reaches the market. As most of the cockerels may go to market between ten and twelve weeks of age, the back region should be well feathered at this age. The problem is, however, primarily a breeding one. As there is a higher percentage of desi than of improved fowls in India, it is fortunate that the desi cockerels acquire a complete covering of feathers at the 39

March, 1951] T. D. MAHADEVAN AND S. BOSE 41 broiler stage (8 to 12 weeks of age). The percentage loss as offal (head, shanks, feet and inedible viscera) was more in White Leghorn cockerels than Rhode Island Red or desi cockerels ; percentages of drawn weight to live weight in the case of both Rhode Island Red and desi cockerels were more than in White Leghorn cockerels at every stage of growth. Therefore, as table poultry, the White Leghorn cockerels are inferior to Rhode Island Red or desi cockerels and occasion considerable reduc- tions in returns. The percentage of edible viscera (heart, liver and gizzard) decreased, in general, with increase of live weight in all the three breeds. The per- centages of edible meat in drawn (eviscerated) cockerels were highest in desi and lowest in White Leghorn cockerels at every stage of growth. The amount of breast meat in desi cockerels was more than in Rhode Island Red or White Leghorn cock- erels. The percentage of breast meat in Rhode Island Red and White Leghorn cockerels did not show any significant differences. The percentages of leg meat (thigh and drum stick) in both Rhode Island Red and desi cockerels were more than in White Leghorn cockerels. There were, however, no significant differences in the percentages of leg meat in the Rhode Island Red and desi birds. As the birds for table should have a high proprotion of meat to bone at killing age and a high proportion of the meat should be breast meat, it is evident that of the three breeds studied in the present investigation, the desi cockerels were the most efficient as market poultry and should therefore command higher prices than the Rhode Island Red or White Leghorn cockerels. Moreover, the average food consumption of desi cockerels was lower than that of Rhode Island Red cockerels but equal to that of White Leghorn cockerels. As the percentages of edible meat in the desi has been found to be significantly higher than in the other two breeds, the desi cockerels give higher net return and should fetch higher premium than the Rhode Island Red or White Leghorn birds. The conformation of the dressed desi cockerels also graded higher than of the other two breeds of cockerels. The conformation of the dressed desi, Rhode Island Red and White Leghorn cockerels were classed as full fleshed, fairly well fleshed and poorly fleshed grades respectively [Charles and Stuart, 1946]. SUMMARY The determination of the percentage of edible flesh in the Rhode Island Red, White Leghorn and desi (indigenous) cockerels at 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks of age respectively revealed that the percentage of total edible meat was highest in the desi and lowest in the White Leghorn cockerels at all the stages of growth. The percentage of breast meat also was higher in the desi than in the Rhode Island Red or White Leghorn cockerels. As regards efficiency, the three breeds ranged themselves in the following descending order : The desi, Rhode Island Red and White Leghorn. The conformation of the dressed desi, Rhode Island Red and White Leghorn cockerels were classed as fully fleshed, fairly well fleshed and poorly fleshed grades respectively. REFERENCE Charles, T.

STUDIES IN THE WOOL QUALITY OF PATTANWADI SHEEP By SUNANDA NARAYAN, Laboratory Officer, Wool Analysis Laboratory, Jaipur (Received for publication on 29 April 1949) (With Plates I-IV and one text figure) PATTANWADI is the main type of sheep in North Gujrat extending upto Palanpur in the north, Viramgham in the south, Cutch in the west and Mahikanta in the east. There are about five lakhs of sheep in this area and two lakhs of the same type of sheep are said to be existing in Cutch also, mostly with the stationary sheep farmers. As the story is recited by the breeders in these areas, the home of Pattanwadi breed is Cutch. About 60 years back the entire sheep population of this state was of this type. During severe drought years, large number of flocks had to go across to North Gujrat in search of grazing. Gradually North Gujrat acquired these sheep permanently both because some of the flocks changed hands and because some of the breeders themselves settled down here. Other breeders from Cutch crossed their sheep with Marwari rams, to introduce the qualities of hardiness, resis- tance to diseases, and thriftiness, necessary for nomadic sheep and evolved the Cutchi nomadic sheep of to-day, breeding true. Pattanwadi sheep are lightly built, brown faced, curved nosed animals, resembl- ing the Kathiwadi in many respects. They produce one of the finest types of wool in India. They are usually bred in flocks of 50 to 100 head. The farmers depend mostly on milk and secondarily on wool for their income out of these sheep. Mutton is of no value to them as they have sentimental objections to slaughtering of animals. As such their breeding policy is to increase the yield of both these products. They do so not only by selecting such rams of the same breed but also resort to cross- breeding with Cutchi rams whose wool yield is better or Chanothar sheep which have better milking capacity. The wool produced by Cutchi sheep is coarser and more medullated than that of Pattanwadi while Chanothar wool is very coarse and extremely hairy (Plates I, II and III). As the rate of wool is fixed without parti- cular reference to quality, the breeders do not appreciate the effect on the wool quality of their sheep by resorting to these methods of breeding which are fast leading to disintegration of the fine woolled Pattanwadi breed. As a part of the drive towards sheep and wool improvement in this area, the former Baroda Government established a sheep breeding farm to rear up im- proved and pedigreed Pattanwadi rams for distribution to the sheep farmers in Patan-Mehsana District. Attached to the farm was set up a Wool Analysis Labora- tory, subsidised by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research to help in selection and breeding of better wool bearing stock and fixing up of specifications for the commercially graded wools. The different attributes of length, crimp, fineness, medullation and density of fibres, of wool samples of the sheep collected at the above farm and their progenies were recorded here. The results of these studies 43

Mean values of length vary from 2.0 to 5.5 inches with largest frequencies at 2.75, 3.25, and 3.75 inches while those for crimp vary from 5 to 12 with largest frequencies at 6.5, 7.5 and 8.5. According to the breeding policy mentioned above it was necessary to choose minimum values for length and crimp of fibres. 2.5 inches for length and 6 for crimp were chosen so as to allow sufficiently large number of sheep for selection and classification on the basis of other characters. Mean values of diameters vary from 26.5 to 46.5 microns, the largest frequencies lying at 32.5 and 36.5 microns.

It has already been observed that the total medullation per- centage is highest in breech regions which is partly dependent on the increased number of hairy fibres found in this region as observed here.

The analysis of variance shows the variation due to age to be significant at 5 per cent level.

Critical difference for age shows that the differences beween 1 and 5 years and 2 and 5 years only are significant. Goot [1945] has established that in Romney sheep hairiness is highest in the first year fleeces and lowest in the second year fleeces increasing gradually thereafter to either the level of hairiness in the first year or a lower level. According to the result obtained here, it is more likely that hairiness leaches a peak at 4 or 5 years and has to be further investigated with fleeces of the same sheep at different ages. It was observed that the heterotypes of older animals were hairier and more easily distinguishable than the heterotypes of younger animals. The medullation of only the heterotypes of animals of different ages was recorded (Table XII). The heterotypes of older sheep are more medullated than those of younger sheep and with the higher proportion of heterotypes tend to increase the total medullation percentage. The wool follicles seem to tend to grow hair rather than true wool fibres as the sheep ages. TABLE XII Medullation percentages of heterotypes of wool samples from sheep of different ages AGE.

March, 1951] SUNANDA NARAYAN 57 Sex The true wool percentages are higher and medullated fibres lower in wool samples of ewes than of rams (Table X). This variation is seen to be highly significant from the analysis of variance. Thus it can be observed that in general rams carry hairier fleeces than the ewes. The chief characteristic of carpet wools is the presence of hair and heterotypes and higher variability in diameter of fibres. An ideal type of carpet wool according to Von Burgen (Mathews Textile Fibres) should contain 35 per cent or more of heterotypes and less than 4 per cent by weight of kemps. On this basis Pattanwadi wool can be broadly classified into two grades, apparel wool usually cut from young ewes and younger rams and superior carpet wool cut from older sheep. Density of growth of fibres The density of fibres recorded on six regions of 5 rams and 3 ewes varied from 500 to 2,500 fibres per sq.cm.

62 STUDIES IN THE WOOL QUALITY OF PATTANWADI SHEEP [Vol. XXI, Part I, Later 12 pairs of ewes of different ages ranging from 1 to 4 years and with corres- ponding average length of wool in side and back regions were selected. One set was shorn both in autumn and spring and the other set was shorn only in spring. Table XVII gives the average length of wool samples of all the animals both in spring and autumn, spring and autumn yields of twice shorn sheep, spring yield of the other, and the total yield of a few animals of this group in the previous year. The important points that arise here are whether shearing once a year has any deleterious effects on the sheep and how it influences wool yield and quality. The health of all the different aged sheep was throughout normal, thus showing that shea- ring once a year had no adverse effects on the health of the sheep. The total lengths of wool and yields of sheep shorn twice a year were generally greater than the lengths and yields of sheep shorn once a year as shown in Table XVII. Moreover the total yields of a few sheep whose records were available, in the previous year when they were shorn twice, were generally greater than their corresponding yields, when shorn only once a year. Similar increase in yield by shearing twice a year was observed by Jones [1928] on Rambonillet sheep, who concluded that shearing sti- mulates wool growth and leads to better yield per year. The average lengths of all the half yearly samples are below 3.5 in. Among the yearly samples, 1 sample is between 3 to 4 in., 4 samples between 4 to 5 inches and 7 samples above 5 in. Samples of wool sorted and classed out of the yearly fleeces, were comparable to 46's combing which is worth more than the half yearly clip. Though shearing once a year may lead to a slight decrease in yield of wool, the loss due to this is likely to be more than made up by the increased value of the wool grown and the reduction in cost of shearing so that it can be more economical than shearing twice a year. Another point which has to be considered is that the spring clip is white and autumn clip yellow, in these areas. Yellow wool of the same quality is usually sold at slightly lower rates. By shearing once a year the whole clip will be classified as yellow. It will be worth-while carrying a mass scale trial in the field to study the effects on other characters like fineness and soundness and go into these questions in more detail so that shearing once a year may also be included as one of the reforms under the wool improvement drive in these areas, if successful. CONCLUSIONS Variation in different wool characters in Pattanwadi breed have been studied and it has been brought out that there are considerable number of sheep, producing completely non-medullated and one of the finest wools in India. There is room for further improvement even by selective breeding. With improvement in length of fibres by shearing once a year, there are definite possibilities of using the wool produced by this breed in the worsted industry. As such Pattanwadi is one of the best wool breeds in India deserving immediate attention in preserving and extending it. However, as stated earlier, the main source of income out of these sheep to breeders in North Gujrat is milk. It has recently been demonstrated that flocks giving the highest yeilds of milk and fatty matter, also give the heaviest fleeces in Lacaune sheep by Albibon and others [1948]. As such milk production need not be discouraged while striving for greater wool production. Suitable experiments could
March, 1951] SUNANDA NARAYAN 63 be carried out in this breed also to find out the relation between quantity and quality of milk and wool production and help the breeders to get the best out of their sheep. It has been shown that the different characters of wool vary in different parts of the fleece. To make up uniform lots for marketing of wool, it is necessary to examine the entire fleece and divide it into different parts and grade them separately as required. When comparing the quality of samples of wool from two sheep the influence of age, sex and season on different characters of wool should be taken into consi- deration. It has been observed that generally ewes carry finer and less medullated wool than the rams. By choosing a ram of the same wool quality as the ewe with reference to these two characters, female progenies of finer wool than the mothers may be expected. The studies recorded here on the relation between age, sex, and wool quality, have to be considered as preliminary investigations which have shown that more detailed observation on these problems are likely to be fruitful. Contrary to the general impression that shearing Indian sheep once a year is not feasible, shearing once a year in spring could be successfully adopted in these areas, which would lead to improvement in staple length and reduction in cost of shearing.

Lacaune EwesABSTRACTS The Accuracy of Diagnostic Methods used in the Detection of the Tuberclosis Cattle. GREGORY, T. S. (1949). Aust. vet. J. 25, (7) THIS paper considers the usefulness of diagnostic methods suitable for appli- cation in Australia. Consideration of clinical examination has been omitted. It has been mentioned that the old subcutaneous method of testing appeared to be accurate from the results obtained after slaughter. The accuracy was found to be between 80 per cent to 90 per cent. One of the reasons ascribed to the high degree of accuracy was the relative low potency of the old tuberculin used. Later when synthetic medium tuberculin was used by the intradermal method, it was mentioned that the number of non-reacting affected ones decreased and N.V.L reactors increased as a result of the diagnostic product being more potent. The author mentions that the second simultaneous injection into the vulvar lip recom- mended by American workers was not followed in Australia. While listing some factors influencing the accuracy of tuberculin test it has been pointed out that potency is one of the chief factors. Low potency tuberculin ensures high proportion of tuberculous cattle amongst the reactors and tends to leave many affected animals undetected, while the stronger product reduces affected non- reactors and increases N.V.L. reactors. It has also been pointed out that it is neces- sary to adjust the potency so as to overcome the influence of environmental conditions like non specific sensitising agents. The method of testing has also been shown to be one of the factors influencing the accuracy in diagnosis. The intradermal method has universally proved to be the most suitable. The additional accuracy vouchsafed by simultaneous caudal and vulvar injections has not been found to be so in the author's country. A single reading after 72 hours was found to be in no way inferior to the 96 hours method. Personal observations on animals tested at the laboratory indicate that the cervical site and skinfold measurements were more accurate than caudal fold site. The third factor mentioned was infection with other organisms resulting in non specific sensitisation. Although there is little doubt that infection of cattle with avian type tubercle bacillus must be an important factor in tuberculin testing, it appears its importance might have been over estimated. It is essential to use a comparative test to eliminate this factor on the basis of the American opinion tending to show increased N.V.L. reactors on farms with tuber- culons poultry. By using a comparative test with avian and mammalian tuberculin cross reaction to Johne's disease could be discerned, as in that case, the avian tuber- culin will give more pronounced reaction than mammalian tuberculin. The so-called 'skin tuberclosis' may sensitise animals to mammalian and avian tuberculin. Close contact with human consumptives may also lead to tem- porary sensitisation so long as the supply of infectious material is present. Non specific sensitisation may also result from presence of non acid-fast-bacilli as in Traumatic paricarditis and lung abscesses with Corynebacterium pyogenes. Recent 65
66 ABSTRACTS parturition may also affect the reacting capacity till four to six weeks. Cases of tuberculous animals not reacting and non tuberculous animals reacting have been dealt with. The first category includes open or spreader cases and N.V.L. reactors in the second category. The accuracy in diagnosis has not been shown to be increased with the complement fixation test used in conjunction. The C.S.I.R supplementary short thermal tuberculin test is a very useful addition, as the number of N.V.L. reactors on presumably tuberculosis free herds, was lower. Also the Stormont test was far more accurate than the single intradermal and comparative single intradermal tests, as judged from data on 300 heads of cattle tested. (M.S.J.)

THE experiment was done to study the efficacy of sulfaquinoxaline both in the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of young growing chickens under field conditions. The diagnosis of coccidiosis was based on gross lesions; caecal cocci- diosis indicated by caecal lesions being attributed to the species E. tenella, and. intestinal coccidiosis, marked by lesions along the wall of the intestine, being attributed to E. necatrix, the most prevalent species in this form of coccidiosis. In the prophylactic treatment, mash containing 0.05 per cent sulfaquinoxaline was fed with various intermittent feeding schedules e.g. 2ABSTRACTS 67 Rams on rations not supplemented with vitamin A showed impaired body growth, low levels of plasma vitamins A and C, high percentage of cystic pituitary glands, degeneration of the germinal epithelium of the testees except in one, and production of semen of low quality. Deficiency symptoms characterised by mus- cular and nervous in co-ordination, partial loss of appetite, general weakness, night blindness, mild convulsions and general unthriftiness developed after periods varying from 7 to 21 weeks. Supplementation of vitamin A caused normal growth, normal level of vitamins A and C in blood plasma and normal semen production. None of the rams receiving vitamin A had cystic pituitary gland. The effects of the supple- mentation with testosterone propionate or pregnant mare serum were negligible and these products exerted no beneficial effect on semen quality of rams on vitamin A deficient ration. Rams getting ten B-complex vitamins in addition to vitamin A and those supplemented with vitamin A alone did not show any marked difference in the characters studied except that the initial motility and methylene blue reduc- tion time of semen showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the former but because of the small number of animals, it cannot be judged whether the differences are due to change individuality of the rams or to the addition of B-complex vitamins. Blood haemoglobin content remained at normal level in all the experimental animals. Eight rams out of both the vitamin A deficient and supplemented lots died of urinary calculi during the experiment. (S.G.) Breeding Cattle for Increased Adaptability to Tropical and Sub-tropical Environments. BONSMA, J. C. (1949). J. Agric. Sci. B39, 204-221. (Union of South Africa) THE knowledge of the various attributes which promote adaptability in cattle will be of great help to the animal breeder as successful adaptation of animals to the climatic conditions is accurately reflected in their ability to grow, to reproduce regularly, and in the production of milk, meat or fat. Animals to be economically productive in the tropics should be endowed with resistance against intense radia- tion, high temperatures and parasites; furthermore, they should be able to thrive on coarse fodder. The observations recorded in this paper on climatological influence on bovines relate to the Messina Experimental Farm and Mare Agricultural Research Station in the Northern Transvaal. The indigenous cattle are endowed with hair and hide colour and other attri- butes (hair characteristics) to protect themselves against excessive radiation. Black cattle are best adapted for high altitudes where mist frequently occurs. In warm relatively dry regions black colour is unfavourable. The Indian and Afrikaner cattle maintain thermostability even when there is high atmospheric temperature by alteration in their body metabolism, dispersion of superfluous heat from the lungs or evaporation from the hide's surface and to act as radiators of heat they have in addition a well developed dewlap, umbilical fold. They are relatively deep and are of the respiratory types. The coat is smooth and the hair do not have any felting quality. Furry coated animals with woolly hair type coat react drastically in hot weather. Animals with higher H.T.C. (heat tolerance coefficient) at one year are likely to be better suited for use in the tropics.
68 ABSTRACTS In the tropics, the animals should be able to walk long distances with ease to reach their feed and watering places as owing to irregular rainfall, high temperature, natural grazing is deficient. Effective and adequate nutrition afford a partial solution to the problem of adaptation in the tropics. Breeds developed in cool temperature regions become hyperthermic as a result of lack of adaptability to higher environmental temperatures. Animals which can thrive well on coarse fodder should be preferred. The reproductive ability of a poorly adapted animal is low and selection on a fecundity basis is an effective method of breeding for adap- tability. Afrikaner bulls gave an average serviceable life of eight years and ten months while in the bulls of the exotic beef breeds it was only three years and three months. With reference to heart water disease the author opines that animals well adopted to the environment being tick-resistant remain comparatively free from the disease and even when they are affected they recover and the mortality rate is low in them. Regarding eye diseases, it was observed that in herds none of the pigmented eyes were sore, while 7.6 per cent of the slightly pigmented and 38.5 per cent of the non- pigmented eyes were affected.

The foundation stock of Tharparkar Cattle at the Government Cattle Farm, Patna, was built up by purchase of selected Tharparkar cows from Karachi and breeding bulls were obtained from the farm of the Government of India at Karnal. The animals are fairly uniform in size and type. Any progeny retained in the herd is selected for type, size and quality. The management and feeding is more or less the same since the farm was started. As the climatic conditions appear to have certain effect on the physiological activities of the animals hence a brief account of the climatic conditions of Patna is recorded so that it may be known from under what climatic conditions the materials came. In Patna district the cold weather commences early in November and comes to an end in the middle of March. The hot weather then sets in and lasts till about the middle of June. Soon after this the rainy season commences and continues till the end of September; the commencement of the monsoon may be as early as the last week of May or as late as the first or second week of July. The climate in the cold weather is pleasant. In the hot weather, the heat is aggravated by hot porching winds and clouds of dust. In the rains the heat is moist and ener- vating and the nights are oppressive. Owing to the hot and dry Westerly winds which prevail in March and April, humidity is much lower at this season than at any other time of the year. With the approach of the monsoon season, the air slowly becomes more charged with moisture. From October until May the prevailing direction of wind is from the West with the commencement of the Monsoon Easterly winds set in. The average annual rainfall is 46.69 inches. METHODS The first step in this study was to determine the mean gestation period. In order to do this all the available gestation periods of different cows were collected from the herd records. The gestation periods were calculated in days from the date of the last service to the date of parturition; the number of days in each month was taken into account. All cases of abortion have been excluded from this study. The study is based on 1146 gestation periods spread over 14 years. After the com- pilation of the initial records of gestation periods it was found that the shortest gestation period recorded is 231 days and the longest period is 402 days. In Table I the total number of calvings under different gestation periods is given. From Table I it will be seen that the highest number of gestation periods come under 285 days and about 81 per cent of the gestation periods come between 275 and 298 days.

Mean gestation period. In order to determine the mean gestation period, all the calvings have been grouped according to gestation periods of seven days class intervals which has been tabulated in Table II. In compiling this table any calving showing the days of pregnancy less than a particular class intervals was included in the previous group. The mean gestation period was worked out from this table along with the standard deviation and probable error.

The difference is 2.7 ± .65. As the difference is more than three times its own probable error hence the difference is considered significant. Seasonal variation of the mean gestation periods In order to find out whether the climatic conditions have any effect on the ges- tation periods, the gestation periods of calves calving in different months of the year were studied in relation to the mean temperature, rainfall and humidity of those months.

June, 1951] A. C. CHAUDHURI AND C. SINHA 75 In Table IV the mean gestation periods of male and female calves born have been tabulated according to the month of calving along with mean temperature, rainfall and relative humidity. In the Fig. 1 prepared from this table it appears there is a tendency for the gestation period to be lower during the period between the end of winter and begin- ning of summer and between the end of rainy season and beginning of winter, i.e., when the climatic conditions are mild. The duration of the gestation period both in the case of the male and female calves has a tendency to be longer when calving is due in rainy season. From the graph of Fig. 1 it is found that the average gestation period in the case of female calves born is longest in the month of November and in general the graph for the female calves differs from that of the male calves on this point. A reference to the original data reveals the fact that this is due to abnormally longer gestation period of 343 days in that month in case of 2 female calves born. Variation of gestation period according to the stage of calving In order to study whether the age of the cow at the time of calving had any effect either of shortening or prolonging the gestation periods, the mean gestation periods were worked out according to the stage of calving and the result tabulated in Table V.

Mean gestation period
June, 1951] A. C. CHAUDHURI AND C. SINHA 77 The mean gestation periods given in Table V have been plotted in the graph (Fig. 2). From this it appears that there is a tendency of slightly longer gestation period upto the 7th calving, i.e., about 10 to 12 years of age and after that the ten- dency is for shorter gestation period. As the number of calvings available from the 10th calving are very few, the record from that stage is not significant. Birth weights of calves in relation to gestation period In order to see whether longer gestation periods are in any way connected with higher birth weights, the birth weights of calves were classified according to the gestation periods. As it was not the practice of recording the birth weights of calves from the beginning when the farm was started but introduced in later years; the birth weights of only 171 calves are available. The result has been tabu- lated in Table VI. TABLE VI Birth weights of calves in relation to gestation period Birth weights lb.

June, 1951] A. C. CHAUDHURI AND C. SINHA 79 SUMMARY In Tharparkar cattle 1146 gestation periods were studied. The mean gestation period is 287.15± 34 days. The mean gestation period when male calves are born is 288.50± 46 days. The mean gestation period when female calves are born is 285.80± 48 days. There is a slight variation in the gestation period according to the season of calving. The gestation period appears to be slightly affected by the age of the cow at the time of calving. The mean birth weight of the male calves is slightly more than that of the female calves.

CERTAIN ASPECTS OF FERTILITY IN THE COW* By C. KRISHNA RAO, G. M. V. C., B.V.Sc., M.S.(CALIF.), Lecturer in Animal Husban- dry, Madras Veterinary College (Received for publication on 7 March 1950) FOR the breeder of livestock, there is no more important economic problem than the fertility of his animals. Animals are simply natural machines utilised by man for turning feed into power, meat, milk, wool and eggs, all these qualities being very much dependent on their reproductive efficiency. Every animal that either temporarily or permanently loses its fertility is plainly a liability to its owner. Dairy cattle that fail to conceive within three to four months follow- ing their last calving are also apt to be liabilities for at least part of that year. For maximum breeding efficiency, every dairy cow should give a calf each year. Animals that do not conceive when young show an increasing tendency towards sterility. There is undoubtedly a small annual loss in every herd owing to their breeding effi- ciency not reaching the maximum. Fertility as applied to the female is its ability to produce viable ova and to provide a suitable environment for the fertilization and subsequent development and finally give birth to the fully developed foetus capable of separate existence. The term fertile is only relative and fertility is a quantitative characteristic, there being various gradations in fertility. The grades high and low fertility are often used to describe differences between individuals. A large number of factors are involved in the problem of fertility and these are very closely interrelated. Age of the animal, its physical condition, the plane of nutrition, heredity and manage- ment are by far the most important controlling factors. The fertility of the herd as a whole is a matter of greater importance than the fertility of any individual cow. According to Lush [1945] this is something like 1.8 to 2.5 services for concep- tion in herds of dairy cattle not complicated by the presence of contagious abortion. This is very well brought out by the study of Miller and Graves [1932] who found that both heifers and cows which were positive for contagious abortion required more services per conception than those belonging to the abortion-negative groups. These workers showed that while abortion-positive cows required 3.03 services per conception abortion-negative cows required 2.51 services for conception. Similarly abortion-positive heifers needed 3.92 services per conception as against 3.31 services for abortion-negative heifers. It is generally felt that heifers require more services for the first conception than for the succeeding ones. Eckles [1932] studied the breeding records of 311 two-year old heifers, 23 of which proved to be non-breeders and of the remaining 288 fertile * This work was completed in December 1946, when the author was a graduate student in the Department of Animal Husbandry, University of California. The kind cooperation and encourage- ment of Dr G. H. Hart, Head of the Department of Animal Husbandry and Prof. F. W. Mead, Asso- ciate Professor of dairy Husbandry are very deeply appreciated. 81
82 CERTAIN ASPECTS OF FERTILITY IN THE COW [Vol. XXI, Part II, heifers 2.4 services were required per conception. The highest proportion of sterility upto nine years of age was reported in the two-year old group and after ten years of age the percentage of sterility was found to increase rapidly with increasing age. Graves [1936] reported that in one Holstein herd 3.38 services were required for the first conception. The same investigator in a study of registered Jerseys found that 4.33 services were required for the first conception, 3.37 for the second and 1.67 for the third to sixth conception. Morgan and Davis [1938] found from a study of the University of Nebraska herd that virgin heifers required more services per conception than any other age group from two to thirteen years with the exception of those in the ten-year old group. Bowling, Putnam and Ross [1940] found that the first conception of the heifers required 2.79 services as compared with 1.8 services for later conceptions. Baker and Quisenberry [1942] reported that fertility was lowest at four years and highest at nine years as determined by the percentage of calf crop in range beef cattle. In a study of fertility in range beef cattle, Lasley and Bogart [1943] found that fertility in heifers between two and three years of age was lower than in cows of other ages. While the heifers required 2.37 inseminations per calf, fertility was highest in five and six year old cows, which required 1.36 inseminations per calf. Beginning at the sixth year of age fertility gradually declined with increas- ing age until the ninth or tenth year, when the cows required 2.09 services per calf, the decline in fertility presumably being due to the decline in vigour with advancing age. From the data presented by Miller and Graves [1932] for the Beltsville herd it is found that abortion-negative heifers required 3.31 services per conception while abortion-negative cows required 2.51 services per conception. Similarly abortion- positive cows required 3.03 services per conception as against 3.92 services for abor- tion-positive heifers. This low fertility in heifers appears to be a rather general feature than an exception in most herds. The objects of the present investigation are to determine the effect of the incid- ence of contagious abortion on fertility in cows, the effect of abortion on the number of services required for conception and also to study the effect of age on fertility. MATERIALS AND METHODS For the present investigation, dairy herds which were under the supervision of the Animal Husbandry Department of the University of California were chosen and their herd records analyzed. For the study of the effect of contagious abortion on fertility, the herd of Norman Neal was chosen and two three-year periods were selected. In the first period from 1 January 1934 to 31 December 1936, con- tagious abortion was prevalent in the herd but every one of the animals was not tested for Brucellosis. Since that herd consists of animals that were positive for Brucellosis and other non-tested animals which were probably non-infected for the most part, that herd was called the mixed herd. The second period was from 1 January 1943 to 31 December 1945 and the herd was free from contagious abortion during this period. A gap of six years was given between the two periods under study with the view of avoiding any of the animals in the first group being carried over to the second period. The herd under study in the second period is called the healthy herd. Only those services were included in the study the results of which were known during those periods.
June, 1951] C. KRISHNA RAO 83 For the study of the effect of age on fertility, four dairy herds were selected which were also under University supervision and animals from each herd were selected in such a way that these could be followed for the first three conceptions. Fertility was calculated on the basis of the number of services required for each conception. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 1. Herd fertility The results as regards the study of the effect of contagious abortion on herd fertility are presented in Table I. TABLE I Herd fertility of Normal Neal for two different periods Period Number of animals Number of services Number of conceptions Services per conception Other details Number of abortions Number of heifers Number that went out of the herd 1 January 1934 to 31 December 1936 (mixed herd) 91 275 135 2.03 22 55 27 1 January 1943 to 31 December 1945 (healthy herd) 105 425 160 2.65 4 42 28 The results of this investigation are contrary to expectations in view of the fact that during the first period, when there was a mixed herd the number of services per conception were 2.03 as against 2.65 for the second period, when the herd was free from Brucellosis. It is reasonable to expect that in a herd having abortion- positive animals, although every one of the animals may not be infected, more services would be required per conception for the herd as a whole than in another herd free from this infection. To determine the causes for the higher conception rate in the first period details regarding the number of abortions, during the two periods the number of first breeders and the number of animals that were culled, were collect- ed. When there is a large number of abortions, it is natural to expect a lower herd fertility and so also when a large number of heifers are present in the herd. Simi- larly, if the breeder selects for fertility by sharply culling out animals that prove to be poor breeders, a higher fertility could be expected than when no selection were practiced. From Table I it can be seen that there are more heifers in the mixed herd, which form 60.43 per cent of the herd while heifers form only 40 per cent of the healthy herd and hence the lower fertility in the latter cannot be attributed to heifers. It can also be seen that abortions are more numerous in the mixed herd than in the healthy herd. The animals which went out of the mixed herd during the three-year period were 29.56 per cent. and those culled from the healthy herd during a similar period were 26.66 per cent the number that went out of each herd being the same. From these data, the higher fertility in the mixed herd may be
84 CERTAIN ASPECTS OF FERTILITY IN THE COW [Vol. XXI, Part II, attributed at least in part to the higher reproductive efficiency of the cows themselves, as determined by their heredity and the lower fertility in the healthy herd may also be explained on the same basis. In this connection the important role of the bulls in determining herd fertility cannot be ignored. Miller and Graves [1932] report that in the Beltsville herd, the abortion-negative group of cows required 2.51 services per conception, while the abortion-positive group required 2.96 services per conception before the separation of the two groups. After the separation of the two groups the abortion-negative group required 2.51 services per conception, while the abortion-positive group required 3.07 services. This investigation although not quite comparable with the work of Miller and Graves [1932] clearly shows that a high herd fertility can be maintained even in a partially Brucella-infected herd having cows with a high reproductive efficiency under conditions of good management and that the mere incidence of Brucellosis alone need not necessarily lower the herd fertility in any appreciable degree. 2. Effect of abortion on the number of services required for conception It is generally felt that an animal requires more services per conception following an abortion than after a normal calving. This is particularly the case when such an abortion is followed by complications or when abortion is the sequel to infection with Brucella abortus in cows. Miller and Graves [1932] found that more services are required for conception after abortion than after normal calvings and the results of their study are presented in Table II. TABLE II Number of services required for conception after normal calvings and after abortions Class of females Conceptions Services Services per concep- tion Abortion-negative group Cows bred after normal calving 179 517 2.88 Cows bred after aborting 16 39 2.43 Abortion-positive group Cows bred after normal calving 276 772 2.79 Cows bred after aborting 99 360 3.63 Entire herd Cows bred after normal calving 455 1,289 2.83 Cows bred after aborting 115 399 3.46
June, 1951] C. KRISHNA RAO 85 It can be seen that while abortion-positive cows required more services per conception after abortion than after normal calving, the abortion-negative cows required fewer services for conception following abortion than after normal calving. The results of the present investigation are presented in Table III. TABLE III Number of services required for conception following normal calvings and after abortions Class of females Number of animals Services Conceptions Services per concep- tion Mixed group: Cows bred after normal calving . . 30 52 30 1.73 Cows bred after abortion . . . 21 61 21 2.90 Healthy group: Cows bred after normal calving . . 65 97 65 1.49 Cows bred after abortion . . . 16 35 16 1.93 Entire herd: Cows bred after normal calving . . 95 159 95 1.60 Cows bred after abortion . . . 37 96 37 2.59 It is clear from the above table that more services are required for conception after abortion than after normal calving in all the three groups. The service rate following abortion in the mixed herd is much higher than in the healthy herd indicat- ing that this is presumably due to the pathogenic effect of Brucella abortus on the female genital tract. It is, however, questionable whether all the aborted animals in the mixed herd were infected, since no systematic testing was done, but they probably were infected. 3. Effect of the interval between abortion and subsequent breeding on the number of services for conception It is of common knowledge that an intelligent breeder never puts his cow to the bull after an abortion, without giving it a sufficient period of rest. After an abortion the female genital tract is not in a position to provide a suitable environ- ment for the fertilization, implantation and subsequent development of the ovum for a variable length of time following abortion. This is particularly the case when abortion is followed by complications like metritis, prolapse of the uterus, etc. The careful livestock breeder allows a period of at least one and a half months following normal parturition before he allows the animal to be bred. It is extremely important that aborted animals should get at least this amount of rest if not more to enable their genital system to come back to normal and bring about rapid concep- tion. The data pertaining to the effect of interval between abortion and subsequent breeding on the number of services per conception are analysed and the results are shown in Table IV.
86 CERTAIN ASPECTS OF FERTILITY IN THE COW [Vol. XXI, Part II, TABLE IV Effect of interval between abortion and next breeding on fertility Interval between abortion and next breeding Number of cows Number of services Number of conceptions Services per conception Below 30 days . . . . 6 18 6 3.00 Over 30 days . . . . 15 43 15 2.86 The animals presented in the above table were drawn from several herds which were free from contagious abortion and as such we are dealing with non-infectious abortion in this investigation. The number of animals available for this study is so small that no definite conclusions can be drawn from the above data. The idea that an animal requires a period of rest after abortion is so firmly rooted in the minds of progressive animal breeders that it is rare to find aborted animals being bred within a month following abortion. It is advisable to skip at least a couple of heat periods after abortion before allowing the cow for service. A longer rest period may be necessary if abortion is followed by complications. 4. Influence of age on fertility in cows Several investigators reported that heifers require more services for their first conception than for the succeeding ones. These investigators studied fertility in animals belonging to different age groups. In the present investigation groups of animals were chosen from each herd and every animal in each group was followed for the first three conceptions. By this procedure it was possible to study the effect of age on fertility in a given group of animals. The results of this study can be noted in Table V.

In Table VI are presented figures to show the percentage of animals that conceive after the first and subsequent services taking into consideration the first three conceptions.

The animals settled after the first two services for the first conception were 68.47 per cent, for the second conception 79.88 per cent, and for the third conception 91.83 per cent. It is thus evident that animals attained higher reproductive efficiency with the advancement of age at least as far as the first three conceptions are concerned. The reasons for the lower fertility in heifers is not clear. It is possible that this is due to endocrine hypofunction involving parti- cularly the anterior pituitary and the ovaries. Further work is required to throw some light on this aspect. CONCLUSION Certain aspects of fertility in the dairy cow were studied and the following were the findings: High herd fertility can be maintained in a partially Brucella.infected herd having cows with high reproductive efficiency under conditions of good manage- ment. Mere occurrence of the disease need not necessarily lower the herd fertility in a striking manner. More services are required for conception following abortion than after normal calving. Reproductive efficiency is lowest in heifers and this improves with age at least as far as the first three conceptions are concerned.

BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL ASPECTS OF SOME ANIMAL NEOPLASMS By SYED MOHIYUDDEEN, B.Sc., G.M.V.C., B.V.Sc, PH.D (OHIO), Disease Investigation Officer, Department of Animal Husbandry in Mysore, Bangalore (Received for publication on 11 September 1950) (With Plates V-VI.) PRESENT literature concerning oncology of domestic animals is limited mostly to morphological descriptions. This study includes chemical and biological aspects of frequently occurring animal neoplasms in addition to their morphology. Emphasis was placed on the study of melanomas in an attempt to evaluate the present theories regarding their histogenesis. Masson [1948] upholds the neural crest hypothesis for the origin of melanoblasts in man and believes that melanoblasts from different tissues would together form a system of neuro-ectodermal origin characterized by the common function of secretion and eventually the excretion of melanin. Allan [1949] strongly favours the idea of epidermogenesis for the origin of cutaneous melanomas stating that many epidermal melanoblasts are not dendritic, a character on which they have been regarded as nerve endings and that the so- called Merkel-Ranvier corpuscles and cells of Langerhans have been assumed to be nerve endings. Apart from this controversy of neurogenesis versus epidermogenesis, Dawson [1925] feels that the intradermal cells also may participate in the formation of melanomas. Willis [1948] has advanced a compromise hypothesis stating that the confusion is due to the presupposition that all melanomas have similar origin. He believes that melanoblasts are not cells of one specific type but are as many and diverse kinds as there are different tissues capable of producing malanin and any attempt to prove the histogenesis of melanomas of different tissues on this or that hypothesis will be artificial. Dihydroxyphenylalanine is the only specific reagent known for the identifica- tion of melanoblasts in frozen sections of fresh tissues. Melanoblasts are dopa- positive while the melanophores are dopa-negative. Dublin [1943] claims that Bodian's silver protein and gold chloride stain is specific for melanoblasts in paraffin sections. Castroviejo [1932] believes that his modification of Cajal's trichromic stain is one of the best for the study of neoplasms composed of different structural elements. Greene [1948] states that the malignancy of a tumor cannot be judged by histological appearance and it is only by its behaviour in the living body that its malignancy can unmistakably be determined. According to him the anterior chamber of the eye provides a favourable environment for heterologous transplanta- tion. Schilling, Snell and Favata [1949] believe that the anterior chamber behaves as a tissue culture medium allowing the survival of tumor cells by virtue of its weak defensive reaction. Although the study of heterologous transplantation in cancer 89
90 BIOLOGICAL & CHEMICAL ASPECTS OF SOME ANIMAL NEOPLASMS [Vol. XXI, Part II, research proved to be of less value than was anticipated, Greene claims that intra- ocular heterologous transplantation is a test for malignancy and degree of autonomy of tumors. It has also been claimed that all tumors which possess the ability to invade and metastasize can be successfully transplanted to alien species and that the completely disorganized tumors often undergo alternations to reveal organized structure indicating the tissue or organ of origin in cases in which this was obscure in the primary host [Greene, 1948; Schilling, Snell and Favata, 1949]. Straus and Cheronis [1948] are of the opinion that tumor cells in contrast to normal mammalian cells obtain energy from glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen and if this difference in the amount of glycolysis in the neoplastic cell is present to an appreciable extent it might be demonstrated by reagents which are capable of reacting with enzymes. They observed that carcinomatous tissues when immersed in one per cent aqueous solution of triphenyl tetrazolium chloride developed pink colour within thirty minutes owing to the reduction of tetrazolium into formazan by the enzyme present in the neoplasm. The uninvolved surrounding tissues remained unstained even after six hours of immersion. One hundred and sixty-four animal neoplasms were studied in regard to their chemical, morphological and biological aspects. One hundred and eighteen were melanomas (one hundred and eight from horses, eight from dogs, and two from swine), forty- two carcinomas and four connective tissue tumors. Representative pieces from melanotic tumors were used to prepare frozen sections stained by dopa reagent and paraffin sections by protogol and gold chloride stain of Bodian. These stains which were specific for melanoblasts were used as controls to compare the reaction in paraffin sections stained by Acetic-Fuchsin-Formalin method of Castroviejo. Highly pigmented tissues were bleached by immersing in three per cent hydrogen peroxide for six days prior to staining. The dopa-positive and silver protein-positive melanoblasts were found to be fuchsin-positive in paraffin sections of melanomas. Therefore modified Castroviejo's stain is regarded as a convenient method to identify a true melanotic tumor with routinely prepared paraffin sections from fixed tissues. Melanophores, experi- mentally produced by injecting melanin suspension into albino rabbits were negative to fuchsin when subjected to Castroviejo's stain. The stain provides easy means of differentiation between a true melanin-producing cell and a phagocytic cell containing melanin and it seems to be a reliable test especially for the identifica- tion of amelanotic melanomas in paraffin sections. Cytological features and histological appearances were not similar in all melanomas studied. Variations in size, shape and pattern of arrangement of melanoblasts were observed. They were either oval or polyhedral in shape usually with a single nucleus but rarely multinucleated. Melanoblasts were arranged in parallel cords or in acinar groups or presented in indefinite pattern. Structures resembling Wagner-Meissner's corpuscle were observed in some cutaneous melanomas. Melanotic pineal bodies of horses and a few melanomas of muscles and salivary glands showed dendritic melanoblasts. Melanomas of gray horses were infiltrative and highly anaplastic and regarded as malignant not only by the morphological appearance but also by their ability to grow in the anterior chamber of guinea pig eyes. The pigment-producing function of melanoblasts was not impaired by their residence in the anterior chamber.

92 BIOLOGICAL & CHEMICAL ASPECTS OF SOME ANIMAL NEOPLASMS [Vol. XXI, Part II, The epidermal origin of melanoblasts was supported by the following morpho- logical features in cutaneous melanomas: (1) melanoblasts in the upper layers of the epidermis suggesting the transformation of the epithelial cells to melanoblasts, (2) the phenomenon of 'Abtrofung' or the downward migration of epidermal melanoblasts into the dermis and (3) the occurrence of epithelial pearl-like structures. In melanomas of other organs the presence of dendritic melanoblasts and structures resembling Wagner-Meissner's corpuscles favoured neurogenesis. Histological evidences in melanomas studied support the hypothesis that these neoplasms have more than one origin. The idea is also supported by the fact that melanoblasts normally occur in entirely different tissues of the body. Twenty-three thyroid tumors from horses were also studied. They were intraglandular, usually affecting one lobe and separated from the normal thyroid tissue by a thin fibrous capsule. No metastases were found. On the basis of histological features the tumors were classified as adenomas and adenocarcinomas however, their biological behaviour indicated that all were benign. None of the five sets of transplants of six animals each, showed growth. Their benign nature was also supported by the absence of infiltrative tendency and metastasis of the tumors in the primary host. Carefully selected fragments from 41 fresh animal tissues (25 malignant, 10 embryonic non-neoplastic and 6 benign) were transplanted to the anterior chamber of 241 guinea pigs. Growth occurred in 13 out of 25 malignant tissues, in 7 out of 10 embryonic non-neoplastic tissues and in none of the 6 benign tissues. All implants of benign tumors were invariably absorbed within six to nine weeks. Fifty-two per cent of the histologically diagnosed malignant tumors such as equine malignant melanoma and renal carcinoma, bovine squamous cell carcinomas, canine osteogenic sarcoma and seminoma and avian renal carcinoma showed good growths in heterologous anterior chamber transplants as indicated in Table I. Malignant tumors did not grow identically in all guinea pigs. These tissue transplants grew in only 23.7 per cent of the animals. Transplants which grew quickly regressed early and those which grew slowly regressed slowly. Most neoplastic tissues grew within two to three weeks after transplantation. In a few cases growth started on the ninth to twelfth day at the earliest and in some others a delayed growth occurred by 24 to 29 days after transfer. Plate V, figs. 1 and 2 presents the above data in detail. All growths were restricted to the anterior chamber and no instance of metastasis was found. An ocular reaction to foreign tissue graft usually occurred but the response was slight or absent to a second transplantation to the same eye. All transplants which grew invariably regressed after a certain period. Regression of all transplants was complete within twelve weeks after transfer. A morhpological survival of about five months without growth or regression occurred in some trans- plants of equine melanomas and bovine carcinoma after an initial take. Guinea pigs in which the transplants were absorbed or regressed after growth were as a rule resistant to second transplantation to the same eye. Exceptions were two avian renal carcinomas which grew better during second transplantation although the implants in both transplantations were identical in regard to the type of tumor, the organ of origin and the species of animal. The span of life of animal neoplasms transplanted to guinea pig eyes was shorter than that reported for human neoplasms. A diagnosis of malignancy based on

June, 1951] SYED MOHIYUDDEEN 93 heterologous growth, irrespective of its practical weaknesses, was a valuable confirma- tory test. Histopathological estimations of malignancy were usually correct but in a few instances proved by the biological test to be erroneous. The residence of a tumor in a heterologous anterior chamber as a rule did not alter its histological appearance. Some ocular growths showed better organization and structural details than the original tumors. Heterologous growth of a seminoma from a dog (Plate VI, fig. 3) organized sufficiently to betray even its malignant nature. Heterologous growths of renal, testicular, thyroid, and ovarian embryonic tissue transplants showed early differentiation. One per cent aqueous solution of triphenyl tetrazolium chloride was used to demonstrate reducing enzymes in neoplastic tissues. Thin sections of living nonneoplastic tissues of animals were immersed in the solution and incubated at 37°c. Neoplastic tissues reduced tetrazolium compound within 15 to 30 minutes whereas non-neoplastic tissues as a rule did not develop the reaction even after three hours. Normal tissues from guinea pigs and dogs such as jejunum, ileum, heart and skeletal muscles slowly reduced tetra zolium salt. Malignant neoplasms developed a positive reaction within 7 to 10 minutes. By intra-venous injection of bacteria-free filtrate of two per cent aqueous solution of triphenyl- tetrazolium chloride in doses of 25 mg. per km. it was observed that the neoplastic lesions developed the reaction earlier than non-neoplastic tissues of the body. The time required for the reaction seems to be an important factor in the interpretation of the results and this test can only be used as preliminary step in the diagnosis of a biopsy material prior to histological examination.

ACTION OF GIGANTIN (ACTIVE PRINCIPLE OF MADAR JUICE) ON THE AMPHIBIAN HEART By V. RATHNASABAPATHY, B.V.Sc., J. C. DAVID, M.B., Ph.D., and V. ISWARIAH, B.A., M.B.B.S., M.R.C.P. (From the Research Unit in Indigenous Drugs, Department of Pharmacology, Madras Medical College) (Received for publication on 3 April 1950) (With Plates VII-XII) MADAR juice is a white milky liquid obtained from Calotropis gigantea, known as erukku in Tamil, jelledu in Telugu and madar in Hindustani. It is common- ly used as a criminal poison, for infanticide and producing abortion. Several thera- peutic properties have been attributed to it. It is said to be an effiecient anti- spasmodic, alterative and nervine tonic in doses of one grain to three grains. It is claimed to be useful in cases of asthma, epilepsy and paralysis. Although the emetic and toxic effects of the root bark and milk juice of Calo- tropis were repeatedly observed in animals and men, it remained for Lewin [1913] to show conclusively the digitalis like action of the milky juice of Calotropis procera. Chemists efforts hence forth have been directed to the isolation of these active principles. Wieland succeeded in isolating 'Calotropin' as a chloroform addition compound. His work was followed by Jacobi on the same product. Both of them withheld publication. Hesse et al [1939] in their investigation of African arrow poisons, obtained from the Calotropis saps several poisonous principles, Uscharin, Calotoxin and Calactin, of which Uscharin is of particular interest, for unlike most cardiac glycosides it contained nitrogen and sulphur in its molecule. Chen [1942] has also isolated Uscharin and other principles and studied their digitalis like action. Sheshadri et al. [1943] state that they obtained from madar juice cardiac poisons containing nitrogen and sulphur, similar to Uscharin but they did not isolate any poisonous principle in a pure state. Pichandi [1948] in his endeavour to isolate the poisonous principle of madar juice in a pure state succeeded in his attempts and got it in the form of pure crystals with a melting point of 232°C. with decomposition. The molecular weight as obtained by Rast's method using camphor as solvent was found to be about 464. The formula C24 H36 O9 was therefore proposed as the tentative molecular formula and the tentative name 'gigantin' was suggested by the same author. Using the same method for isolation, the authors [1949] of this paper, obtained the crystalline substance tentatively named 'gigantin' from the madar juice and did some preliminary pharmacological studies, the results of which have been presented in a previous publication. The present study is the outcome of the 95
96 ACTION OF GIGANTIN ON THE AMPHIBIAN HEART [Vol. XXI, Part II, detailed investigation being carried out with a view to explore the possibilities of therapeutic usefulness of the substance, which resembles digitalis in many respects. MATERIALS AND METHODS Gigantin obtained as mentioned above [Pitchandi, 1948] was insoluble in water, Therefore a stock solution of 1 in 1,000 was prepared in 90 per cent alcohol and dilutions were made in distilled water according to the experimental needs. The amount of alcohol present in a single dose of the drug after large dilutions, was negligible and it did not interfere with the true action of the drug and this has been proved by control experiments by administering similar dilutions of 90 per cent alcohol alone. Rana-hexa-dactyla, the species found in large numbers in and around Madras was used in all the experiments. The weight of the frogs ranged from 180 g. to 250 g. and the heart weight 500 mg. to 800 mg. Methods The action of the drug on the hearts in situ was studied by myocardiogram of the exposed hearts, the drug being administered intra-hepatically through any one of the lobes. Perfusion of isolated hearts was done through the inferior venacava using Clark's [1928] perfusion fluid. The perfusion apparatus consists of a Syme's canula connected with two perfusion funnels through a two-way stop-cock. By this arrangement fluid from any one funnel could be switched on to the canula with great ease and with least disturbance to the heart. The perfusion canula designed by Symes [1911] and [1918] was slightly modified by blowing a hole about 1 cm. above the tip of the nozzle. This hole serves three purposes. (1) It keeps the perfusion pressure constant at about 2 cm. on the ventricle and a little over 1 cm. on the auricle. (2) When the perfusion fluid is changed the fluid remaining in the connecting tubes is flushed out quickly through the side hole without any appre- ciable change in the pressure. (3) A certain amount of the perfusion fluid escaping through the exit keeps the outside of the heart moist. The action of the drug on isolated hearts was studied by two different methods. (1) By perfusing the heart for a short while with ringer solution containing the drug and subsequently followed by normal ringer. (2) By perfusing the heart conti- nuously with ringer containing the drug in a known concentratoin, to study the effect of the drug on the heart muscle. EXPERIMENTAL DATA Action on the rate and amplitude of the heart in situ The results of nine experiments conducted in this series showed that 0.0025 mg. of gigantin given to frogs intra-hepatically produced either an increase or no change in the rate of the heart beat. The amplitude was decreased initially and within two minutes gradually returned to normal (Plate VII, fig. la.) Higher doses from 0.01 to 0.05 mg. caused an immediate slowing of the rate and diminution of the amplitude, recovery to normal taking place in about 5 to 10

Perfusion of the isolated frog's heart with 1 c.c. of 1 in 10,000 concentration of gigantin in ringer, produced an immediate acceleration of the heart from 20 to 36 beats per minute. This is approximately 80 per cent increase over the normal. The amplitude was diminished considerably due to the deficient relaxations, the systolic level being normal. The concentration of the drug being toxic arrested the heart in complete systole in three minutes (Plate VIII). Perfusion with 1 c.c. of 1 in 100,000 concentration of the drug in the ringer followed subsequently by normal ringer did not alter the rate or the amplitude to any appreciable degree. Continuous perfusion of isolated frog's heart with gigantin in a physiological concentration of 1 in 5 million in the perfusion fluid decreased the rate and increased the amplitude of the heart beat from the beginning, the increased amplitude being due to the increased systolic excursions. No heart block and no contracture were observed and the heart worked satisfactorily for more than an hour and a half (Plate IX, and Table I). The results of seven perfusions showed that 1 in 1 million concentration of the drug, which was lethal in about 25 to 35 minutes, reduced both the rate and the amplitude for the first 5 minutes. Then the rate continued to be lessened whereas the amplitude was increased gradually due to the increase in the systolic level, the diastolic level being normal. The heart was regular till the 6th minute, became irregular afterwards due to the occurrence of heart block. It was finally arrested in diastole (Plate X, and Table I). Perfusion with 1 in 500,000 concentration of the drug in the perfusion fluid did not produce any change in the rate for about a minute. This was followed by a gradual slowing and arrest of the heart in about 18 minutes. The amplitude was reduced to 50 per cent of the normal, the diminution being due to the deficient relaxations. The systolic level was either normal or increased. The heart was regular for the first few minutes. Then it became irregular due to the auriculo- ventricular block, resulting in the arrest of the heart. Still higher concentrations as 1 in 100,000 in the perfusion fluid, which was lethal in 9 to 14 minutes, caused slowing of the rate and increase of the amplitude from the beginning. Here again the increase was due to the increased systolic excursions. But the diastole was deficient due to the inability of the heart muscle to relax fully to the normal. The heart was regular till the 4th minute. Irregu- larities in the form of extra systole were observed between the 4th and the 6th minutes. Later heart block set in and arrested the heart in diastole (Plate XI, and Table I). A highly toxic concentration as 1 in 10,000 of the drug in the perfusion fluid, which was fatal in 3 minutes, completely reversed the series of events. The heart was accelerated from the beginning, the amplitude diminished till the end. The systolic level was normal whereas at each successive beat the heart lost its power of relaxation and stoped in complete systole. This phenomena has been termed as ' contracture ' and this resembles that of digitalis.

I. 99 An isolated perfused heart which is devoid of the extrinsic nervous mechanism was a tropinised by applying a few drops of a 0.5 per cent solution of atropine. Such a heart continued to respond to gigantin in the usual way indicating clearly that the action of the drug is completely independant of the nervous mechanism. Changes in rhythm and conductivity100 ACTION OF GIGANTIN ON THE AMPHIBIAN HEART [Vol. XXI, Part II, systole of the ventricle was determined in distance of the primary from the secondary coil, both before and after the administration of the drug. Studied according to this method it was found that the irritability of the cardiac muscle was increased by gigantin. The minimal effective current for stimulating the heart of frog was found to be considerably decreased as shown below (Table II).

R., J. C. D. AND V. I. 101 systolic level which was persistently above normal. The diastole on the other hand was progressively deficient from the increasing slowness of relaxation. The diastolic level was also reduced. The ventricle remained in a condition of semicon- tracture after the active movement towards the end of systole and contractions began even before the heart returned to its normal position of rest in diastole (Plate XI, b and c). Due to the setting in of auriculo-ventricular block by this time, diastole became more complete, because more time was given for relaxation before impulses arrived. The total excurtion of the lever was more than normal till the arrest of the heart in diastole by the heart block. In a very toxic concentration (1 in 10,000) the heart was arrested in complete systole in three minutes by the progressively deficient diastole. At every successive beat the contractions were normal while the relaxations were imperfect and greatly reduced, probably due to the predominance of contracture. Thus in addition to changes in rhythm, individual beats undergo modifications under gigantin. Under physiological concentrations the phase of increased contrac- tility may be prolonged until the drug is excreated or destroyed. The relaxations may be slower but complete. After larger doses (lethal dose) this phase accompanied by deficient diastole is prolonged until it is interrupted by the intermissions of the ventricle. In a highly toxic dose this phase may be of very short duration, mainly indicated by deficient diastole and systolic arrest of the ventricle. The 'contracture' which culminates in the arrest in systole, is essentially in its beginning an imperfect relaxation. The work of the heart102 ACTION OF GIGANTIN ON THE AMPHIBIAN HEART [Vol. XXI, Part II, On repeating the dose for the third time the irregularity and the block not only increased in the intensity but also extended to the sino-auricular conducting fibres, resulting in the three parts of the heart the sinus, auricle and ventricle taking their independent rhythms. It recovered gradually but took about 10 minutes to gain normal rhythm. It may be inferred from the above experiment that the returning of the normal rhythm after a dose of gigantin is not an indication of the complete elimination of the drug from the body. There is a certain amount which is left over in the system which takes a longer time for complete excretion. When the drug is repeated within a short interval, though in the same dose, it combines with the drug already existing in the body and produces a cumulative effect which resembles a toxic dose. Isolated hearts perfused continuously with 1 in 5 million of gigantin in the ringer produced a slowing of the rate and increased amplitude. After an hour the perfusion fluid was changed to normal ringer. The heart however did not return to normal as expected even after a considerable time. This may probably be due to the absorption and fixation of the drug in the heart muscle. Perfusion of isolated frog's heart with 1 cc of ringer containing 1 in 100,000 of gigantin produced no appreciable change, except an increase in the amplitude of the beats. The use of normal ringer immediately after this took about 9 minutes to bring back the heart to normal rhythm, showing that the drug got fixed in the muscle and could be removed only by prolonged perfusion with normal ringer. After 9 minutes when the heart had apparently returned to normality it was again perfused with 1 cc of ringer having gigantin in the same concentration as above and subsequently followed by normal ringer. The heart behaved differently from the above experiment. The contracture was observed prominently by the progressive slowness of relaxations, thus resembling the effects of a toxic dose. The heart returned to normal only after a prolonged perfusion with normal ringer for an hour. Perfusion for the third time with 1 cc of ringer having gigantin as in the pre- vious case and followed by normal ringer subsequently, not only produced more toxic symptoms as increased contracture but also produced auriculo-ventricular block and it took about one hour and a half for the heart to return to normal. A further dose arrested the heart in two minutes, in partial systole. This only indicates that the drug gets fixed in the heart muscle. Relation of calcium to gigantinPlate XII ] [ Indian J. vet. Sci., Vol. XXI Part I [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] A record of the movements of the ventricle of an isolated frog's heart. (Time 6 seconds. Upstrokes are systole.) R.= Normal ringer: RJune, 1951] V. R., J. O. D. AND V. I 103 Perfusion of isolated heart with ringer having no calcium produced diastolic arrest in about a minute. A concentration of 1 in 1 million of gigantin in the ringer as a substitute to calcium did not revive the heart when applied after the diastolic arrest. Changing over to normal ringer, having calcium, at this stage however had the desired effect. When the heart returned to normal it was again perfused with ringer having no calcium. As the heart was in half way towards the diastolic arrest the perfusion fluid was changed over to ringer having 1 in million gigantin in the place of calcium. The effect of the previous perfusion continued for a few seconds. Then the indivi- dual beats greatly increased in the amplitude and the heart continued to work with gigantin in the place of calcium in ringer for about 15 minutes (Plate XII). Finally it was arrested in systole. Thus gigantin may be said to synergesise the action of calcium but cannot replace it in the perfusion fluid. DISCUSSION The effect of gigantin on the frog's heart appears to differ diametrically accord- ing to the dose. The typical action of the drug is a complex of two different factors namely slowing and increased contracture and is best observed when a minimum lethal dose is applied to the heart. Most of the changes can be followed in the exposed intact heart, but the details are best studied in the excised heart perfused with ringer containing the drug. The heart rate is often slowed under the action of gigantin in early stages, more rarely accelerated or unchanged. This change in rate is not inhibitory in nature and it affects the whole heart, so that it might arise from some change in the activity of the pace maker. But the occasional intermissions of the ventricle and the other disturbances in rhythm and the final arrest in diastole must arise from the failure of efficient stimuli to reach the ventricle, -for the auricles continue to beat at their previous rate when the ventricle is reduced in its rhythm. Similarly the sinus preserves its rhythm at a later stage while the auricles beat at a reduced rhythm. The impulses emitted by the pace maker of the heart in the sinus venosus thus fail to arouse the auricle to contraction as at a previous stage the impulses which caused beats in auricle were unable to arouse the ventricle. The auricle or the ventricle in the absence of impulses to contract remain in the position of rest and intermissions of the ventricle or of both auricle and ventricle occur and when a number of successive impulses fail prolonged and final stand still results. The failure of the conduction is first manifested in the auriculo-ventricular connecting fibres, but later extends to the sino-auricular fibres, giving rise to auri- cular intermissions and pauses of the same character as seen more frequently in the ventricle. Finally the pace maker may be slowed and arrested. The contracture, which culminates in the arrest in systole, is essentially in its beginning an imperfect relaxation. Under physiological doses it is manifested by the slowness of relaxations, in lethal doses by deficient diastole and in very large toxic doses by the systolic arrest of the ventricle. The exact nature of contracture is still a matter of question. It has nothing in common with normal contraction. It has a nearer analogy in the prolonged contracture of voluntary muscle which is
104 ACTION ON GIGANTIN ON THE AMPHIBIAN HEART [Vol. XXI, Part II, seen under veratrine, in tetanus, fatigue and similar conditions. It may be an exaggeration of muscle tone in unstriated muscle and the heart itself, though this hardly brings enlightenment, for tone is still an obscure quality. Cushny [1935] after his experiments with digitalis series of drugs, forwards that the contracture is due to some change in the muscle fibres which shorten them without significantly changing their elasticity. The efficiency of the heart seems to be increased under the physiological doses of gigantin, by the powerful systolic contractions and slow but complete relaxations, when there is a better filling and emptying of the ventricle. Thus the pulse volume may be said to be increased. The work done in a unit of time is the product of the rate of beat and the amount of blood expelled by each contraction. When the rate is slowed under gigantin, the influence of the drug upon the output per beat is the chief point at issue. If contractions become more complete and the relaxations remain unchanged the output per beat is naturally greater. Though the output was not measured in these experiments, but only the muscular contraction, it may be inferred that the pulse volume increased in correspondence. But the work done per minute might not be increased to a great extent since the increased pulse volume is compensated for by the slowing. It may be said that the efficiency of the frog's heart is increased especially when it is diseased or irregular before the administration of the drug. The improve- ment in the work is obvious when a previous irregular rhythm becomes regular under the drug. In a toxic dose there is no question of efficiency, for as contracture develops it is obvious that each beat expells less blood from the ventricle. It is of special interest to note the relation of gigantin to calcium salts since the latter tend to increase the strength of the beat and promote contracture in the same way as gigantin and digitalis. The weak beats which are characteristic of the heart beating with insufficient lime are generally strengthened by the addition of gigantin. When the heart has ceased to beat from want of calcium it can be induced to contract for some time by the addition of gigantin sufficiently early before the diastolic arrest. But these contractions under gigantin are merely evi- dence that it increases spontanity of the heart muscle and may be compared to the effect of electrical stimuli rather than to the action of calcium. Gigantin and digitalis. The action of gigantin on the frog's heart resembles in many respects that of digitalis. The slowing, the contracture and the intermissions of the ventricle are all characteristics of the digitalis series of drugs. Experiments show that the drug gets fixed in the heart muscle and can be washed from it only with great difficulty, thus giving rise to cumulative toxicity as digitalis. Whether the drug which is in combination in the heart muscle, is simply deposited there in an inactive form or whether the actual combination is the cause of the changes in the heart is still a matter for study.
June, 1951] V, R., J. C. D. AND V. I. 105 Gigantin differs from digitalis in that it increases the exitability of the heart muscle and shortens the refractory period whereas the latter acts in the opposite manner. SUMMARY The pharmacology of gigantin on the amphibian heart has been studied in detail. By a direct action on the heart muscle, it is found to increase the efficiency of the heart in physiological doses. Though it produces a synergesic action with calcium, it cannot replace it in the perfusion fluid. The action on the heart is analogous to digitalis in many respects.

DRIED COW MANURE IN THE RATION OF GROWING CHICKENS By D. PARTHASARATHY AND S. G. IYER, Poultry Research Section, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, Uttar Pradesh (Received for publication on 27 September 1950) SINCE Bechdel et al [1928] demonstrated that synthesis of vitamin B took place in the rumen, a series of experiments have been reported confirming their observation and also about the quantities of several members of the vitamin B complex. McElroy and Goss have studied about the synthesis of riboflavin and vitamin K [1940, a], pyridoxine [1940, b], thiamin [1941, a] and pantothenic acid [1941, b] in the rumen of sheep and cows fed diets low in these vitamins. Wegner et al [1941] studied the synthesis of thiamin, riboflavin, pyridoxine, pantothenic acid, nicotinic acid and biotin in the rumen of cows on rations of natural feeds. Similar observations have been made by Hunt et al. [1941, 1943] and Lardinois et al. [1944]. Recently it has been demonstrated that a part of the B-vitamins synthesised in the rumen and also in the digestive tract pass through the digestive system, Lampen et al. [1942] and Hammond [1942] made the interesting observation that cow manure exerted a beneficial effect on growth in chicks when added to a diet deficient in riboflavin. Later Hammond [1944] found that the growth of chicks was increased when cow manure was substituted for alfalfa meal, at a level of eight per cent. Rubin and Bird [1946] presented evidence that the growth factor of the cow manure was different from the growth factors previously described and they [1946, b] also reported a method of extracting and concentrating the growth factor. The factor was found to stimulate the growth of chicks fed a practical diet free of animal protein. In addition to the presence of growth stimulating factors, cow manure was also found to contain male and female sex hormones, Riley and Hammond [1942]. The male sex hormone increases comb growth in chickens. This is an undesirable factor in the case of a pullet grown for egg production. "Whitson et al. [1946] claimed that the androgenic potency of cow manure could be destroyed by drying the manure at 80°C. for 24 hours, and then this manure exerted no effect on egg production, while the manure which was not subjected to the above treatment impaired egg production significantly. To investigate if dried cow manure would stimulate the growth of chickens when incorporated in a ration of vegetable origin, without giving rise to any undesirable effects due to the andro- genic hormone, the present experiment was undertaken. EXPERIMENTAL The cow manure obtained from lactating cows of the Institute Dairy was first dried in the sun spread in a thin layer for about two days. During this period the 107
108 DRIED COW MANURE OF GROWING CHICKENS [Vol. XXI, Part II, maximum air temperature was about 80°F. and much of the moisture was lost. The dried product was roughly crushed and again dried in an electric oven at 80°C. for 24 hours. It was then ground finely in a grinding mill and resembled ground lucerne (dried) in appearance. A basal mash of the following composition was made. Wheat bran . . . . . . . . . . . . 35 parts by weight. Yellow maize meal . . . . . . 39.25 do. Ground oats . . . . . . . . . . . . 10.00 do.

Each group consisted of both White Leghorn and Rhode Island Red breeds in about equal number. The chicks were so divided that the average weight in each of the groups for the same breed was about the same and they were wing banded individually. The three groups were fed on the following rations, and the experiment was of 8 weeks duration. The chemical composition of the ration is given in Table I.

Week Group 1 Group 2 Group 3 1st week 1June, 1951] D. PARTHASARATHY AND S. G. IYEB 111 DISCUSSION The fact that there was marked comb growth in the chickens of either sex.in the group receiving 10 per cent cow manure dried at 80°C. showed that the androgenic potency of the cow manure had not been destroyed by drying at 80°C. for 24 hours. This is at variance with the finding of Whitson et al. [1946] that the androgenic poteacy of the cow manure could be destroyed by drying at 80°C. for 24 hours. An examination of the body weight data (Table II) revealed that the maximum growth was obtained in the group receiving milk. The growth was lowest in the group getting cow manure. This showed that the cow manure had not stimulated any growth in the chickens. The average body weight was lower than that in the negative control group even. It is probable that drying at 80°C. for 24 hours had destroyed the growth promoting factors with the result that the resulting cow manure was devoid of any of the growth promoting factors and has no nutritive value The destruction of the growth promoting factors might also be due to the fact that the cow manure was first dried in the sun and then put in the oven at 80°C. On the other hand Whitson et al. [1946] dried the fresh manure immediately after collection, or kept the manure at 0°C. for storage before drying. In the experiments of Hammond [1942] and Turner [1947] the cow manure replaced wither in part or in whole the alfalfa meal. In the present experiment, however, the dried cow manure replaced ten per cent of the total mash and if the presumption of the destruction of the growth factors by drying at 30°C. is correct it is no wonder that the cow manure mixed ration will have a lower nutritive value as in fact it represents only 90 per cent of the original ration. This may account for the lower growth in the case of the cow manure fed group in comparison with the negative control group. Further in the experiments of the above workers, animal protein supplements have been used to replace alfalfa meal. In the presence of animal protein supple- ments the efficacy or otherwise of the cow manure may not fully manifest itself. In spite of the incorporation of an animal protein supplement, it would be seen in the experiment of Turner [1947] that up to 8 weeks of age, the growth rate in the group getting 10 per cent cow manure was nearly the same as in the control group so far as females are concerned, while in the case of males it was much lower. At 10 weeks of age, however, cow manure seems to have exerted a marked improvement. In this experiment growth was studied up to 8 weeks of age only. Since in this experiment the feeding of cow manure has induced comb develop- ment suggestive of hormonal activity without increasing body weight, it is inferred that the androgenic hormone is not responsible for stimulation of growth, and that it is different from the growth factor. SUMMARY An experiment has been conducted to see if processed cow manure can be incorporated in a ration devoid of animal protein supplements, to increase the growth and make the ration less expensive. It has been found that in spite of drying at 80° C. for 24 hours the cow manure retained some androgenic potency and no evidence of growth promoting activity was observed.

Tén-day old fertile hens' eggs are inoculated with virus into the allantoic cavity ; and those embryos that die within 72 hours and have extensive hæmorrhages of the feather follicles are used for vaccine production. Such chick embryos are finally minced and suspended in crystal violet-ethylene glycol (1 : 400) and the mixture is incubated for 36 days at 37.5° C. This is diluted till the dye content is not greater than 0.00005 per cent. The crystal violet acts with some unknown mechanism as the vaccine without its addition fails to confer protection. ' Herts' egg passage virus or 'Turkey' virus have been used for vaccine preparation. The vaccine retains its potency for about five months at 2° C, to 4° C.; immunity is established by about the 7th day after I/M injection of the vaccine and persists for at least 12 months ; can be successfully used on chicks from six weeks onwards without any reaction or after effects. Turkeys have been successfully immunized with it. The vaccine does not cause any reaction, paralysis or check in growth. (B. N. G.) I.Vaccination against Bovine Brucellosis. BUDDLE M. B. (1948).

In such cases it is advisable to revaccinate soon after first parturition. The tail tip method of vaccination with 1 ml. dose was experimentally com- pared with 5 ml. subcutaneously. The group of animals vaccinated subcutaneously have been shown to exhibit a lower infection rate, a lower abortion rate, a longer mean gestation period and a higher percentage of living calves than the intracaudal group. Lyophilized vaccine, reported to be successful in America was not given a trial in New Zealand. Dead vaccines have been shown to be of no avail as immunizing agents. In the second article a summary of Australian trials with calf-hood vaccination has been given. King at Glenfield Veterinary Research Station (N. S. W.) found that immunity conferred by calf-hood vaccination with strain 19 was negligible when challenged with an artificial source of infection through the conjunctival sae, the break-down in immunity being shown to be due to the heavy infecting dose used for assessing the degree of immunity. The authors vaccinated 27 heifers and these and 29 unvaccinated control heifers were exposed during pregnancy to Brucella abortus infection by running them in a poddock with pregnant heifers which were caused to abort at intervals by inoculating them with a virulent strain of Br. abortus. Only one of the vaccinated heifers (3.7 per cent) showed evidence of infection as judged by the agglutination reaction. Of the unvaccinated 18 (62 per cent) became infected. (K. P. B.)

(I. K.) Newcastle Disesase Immunisation with Live Virus. BEAUDETTE, F. R. BIVINS, J. A. and BARBARA R. MILLER (1949). The Cornell Veterinarian XXXIX, 302-334 THE authors have reviewed the literature rather critically and in great detail and conclude that so far no safe method has been evolved for the use of viru- lent active virus as such or for its attenuation by storage, drying or tissue culture to enable the same to be used as a safe vaccine. But other methods such as passage in embryonating eggs, or in ducks, hamster or sheep brain have given encouraging results. The authors' experiments were based on the presumption that it is possible to come across a naturally low virulent or apathogenic strain, which could be used for immunization without having to be modified, if a large number of strains of Newcastle disease virus were examined. With this in view the authors studied 105 strains of their previous collection. All these strains were first tested on five birds each and all but nine strains were discarded as unsuitable. A strain was regarded as unsuitable if it caused a single death or paralysis. Eight out of the nine were again tested on 42 to 50 birds each and only one was found to be quite safe and satisfactory. This strain was first used for immunization of 2884 chicks at 30-36 days old by 'Stick' and intramuscular methods with a loss of 1.73 per cent from all causes. Of these 578 birds were challenged with a virulent strain, which produced cent per cent mortality in controls, by intramuscular and intranasal instillation methods 15 to 23 days after vaccination and only one died of Newcastle disease. This bird was vaccinated with stick method and challenged by intranasal instillation. Another lot of 8715 chicks were vaccinated with a loss of 1.64 per cent from all causes. In a third series of vaccination a total of 83,059 birds from 25 days to young layers were vaccinated in 20 commercial farms with a loss of 1.82 per cent. This rather high loss was due to a heavy mortality in one of the farms due to some intercurrent disease and if this was eliminated the loss would be only 1.09 per cent. An incident is recorded where 710 chicks between 37 to 41 days old got in- fection with the vaccine strain as a result of housing in rooms which were not disinfected and the mortality was 13.94 per cent. This high mortality was attributed to the infection taking place through the respiratory tract. This incident reveals that vaccinated birds are a source of infection for a time. To confirm this the authors conducted experiments and it was proved that a certain percentage of contact susceptible birds do get a silent infection and become resis- tant to virulent virus. The other observations made by the authors are (1) the proper age for vacci- nation is just when the chicks are four weeks old as by this time the parental immunity, i.e., the passive immunity derived from the immune parent, is lost and the chicks become susceptible, (2) that vaccination of chicks even after the
116 ABSTRACTS disease had appeared in them would reduce mortality, (3) the reaction from vaccina- tion in young chicks is in the way of lowered feed intake for two to three days from the 3rd or 4th day after vaccination and some respiratory sounds which symptoms disappear by the 10th day and (4) there is a drop in egg production which starts from the 5th or 6th day and returns to normal in two weeks. (Re- garding parental immunity which is said to last four weeks and on which the authors have stressed so much it is to be noted here that the experience of workers in this country seems to be contrary. The propagation of either the virulent virus or the Mukteswar vaccine strain virus in embryonating eggs from immune parents always kill the embryos. If there is any so called parental immunity this should not happen. Again day and week old chicks from immune parents do not show any appreciable resistance to an artificial infection with virulent virus. (M. K. S.) The relation between the Month of Calving and Yearly Butterfat Production. MOHAMED M. OLOITFA AND JONES,I. R. (1948). J. Dairy.

S. A.)ABSTRACTS 117 Mineral supplements fed for two months prepartum did not clicit perceptible effects upon the levels of calcium and inorganic phosphorus in the plasma of the new born calves or of their dams. Of a number of whole blood and plasma cons- tituents studied, the outstanding group differences found were the lower levels of reduced and total glutathione in both the cows and calves of group III than in those of the other three groups. Greater concentrations of reduced and total glutathione, calcium, inorganic phosphorus, acid and alkaline phosphatase and ascrobic acid and a greater number of erythrocytes were found in the blood of new born calves than in that of their dams ; a greater corpuscular haemoglobin content, corpuscular volume, and a higher plasma level of total proteins, globulin and albumin were found in cows than in their calves immediately following parturition and before the calf had access to colostrum. Similar concentrations of the various blood constituents studied were found, regardless of the sex of the new born calf. Seven calves which received colostrum prior to the procurement of blood for analyses at an average age of 4.5 hours had strikingly higher plasma levels of total protein, globulin and albumin than those which had not. been nursed by their dams. The blood of the calves which had ingested colostrum contained slightly less haemoglobin, smaller numbers of erythro- cytes and a smaller proportion of the whole blood volume consisting of erythrocyte than the other calves, which may have been due to dilution of the blood. Small quantities of globulin were demonstrable in the plasma of newborn calves prior to the ingestion of colostrum. (K. P.) Farm Dairy Buildings Bacteriological Aspects. THOMAS, S. B. (1949). Soc. Dairy Tech. 2, 127 IN Wales, the dominant change during recent years has been from stock rearing and butter making to milk production, which has necessitated the change in the lay out of farm buildings. About 60 per cent of milk-selling farms in Wales, have less than 10 cows ; the number of such farms have increased from 9,327 to 26,100 during 1934-1947 and hence due regard has been given to small size milking herds. In discussing the bacteriological aspects of a problem of this kind, it is better to confine the attention towards. (1) characteristics of good dairy buildings, (2) condition of cow houses and dairies, (3) contamination of milk from cow house air, (4) fly control and water supply factors. The bacteriological criteria that are needed for assessing the suitability of farm dairy buildings for the production of safe milk with low bacterial count and good keeping quality are, (a) healthy clean cows, (b) milking under hygienic conditions, (c) relatively sterile utensils and (d) prompt and efficient milk cooling, which should be applied in consideration of details regarding site, surroundings, drainage, light, ventilation and facilities for easy cleaning of the cow house and dairy. Contamination of milk from the air of the byre is negligible, when compared with other sources, unless under abnormal conditions, where much dust may be raised during feedling or cleaning operations.
118 ABSTRACTS Flies may be responsible for the bacterial spoilage of milk either falling directly or via utensils into milk, and quite likely, they often carry coliform organisms and other pathogenic types like, Vibrio comma, Shigclla spp. etc., when they alight on faeces and sewage. The insecticide D.D.T. alone cannot be successfully used to minimise their population but quick disposal of manure from farm dairy buildings and careful attention to hygiene at all times, minimise the population of flies to a considerable degree. Water supply on a farm should be adequate and free from saprophytic and pathogenic bacteria. Seventy seven per cent of farm water supplies in mid Wales were unsatisfactory during 1930-47, on a standard of not more than 10 coliform organisms per 100 ml., as advocated for Potable water by the Ministry of Health [1937]. Fifty six per cent of samples were condemned as they showed 50 or more presumptive coli per 100 ml. of water. If an endeavour is made to protect the source of water supply from contamination with surface water and sewage, the bacteriological quality of farm water supplies may be improved. (V. L.) Types or organisms present in commercially pasteurised milk. EGDELL J. W. and BIRD E. R. (1950). J. Soc. Dairy Tech., 3, 171 A BACTERIOLOGICAL survey of 21 samples of milk from the pasteuriser and 21 samples from bottled milk obtained from eleven dairies, was carried out. The procedure followed was to plate the samples on yeasterel milk agar and incubate the plates at 37°, 30° and 22°C. for determining the distribution of the various groups of micro-organisms in the samples. On the basis of certain preliminary tests the organisms which were isolated from each of these plates were classified under one of the five groups, viz., (1) aerobic spore-forming bacteria (2) streptococci (3) microbacteria (4) micrococci and (5) gram negative rods and coccobacilli. An assessment of the percentage distribution of these groups at various temperatures showed that at 37°C. streptococci constituted 48 per cent micrococci 28 per cent, and spore forming rods 16 per cent of the total number of colonies. At 30°C. microbacteria were found to be dominant, constituting 47 per cent of the total, whereas micrococci, streptococci and aerobic spore-forming rods were 20, 16 and 12 per cent respectively of the total number of colonies on the plates. When the plates were incubated at 22°C. there was an overwhelming majority of micro-bacterium colonies, they being nearly 65 per cent whereas other groups oomprised less than of the total 17 per cent. The spore forming rods were negligible in oocurrence. A detailed study of 128 isolates selected from each of these five groups showed that streptococci were largely represented by S. thermophillus. Some cells of S. lactis which must have escaped heat-treatment were also met with. Microbacterium group consisted largely of Microbacterium- lacticum. Among the micrococci, M. varians and M. luteus were the predominant types while among the aerobic spore- forming rods, strains of Bacillus cereus, B. subtillis and B. licheniformis were identified. Presence of certain strains of A. aerogenes indicated that some cells must have escaped heat-treatment. Yeasts, molds and actinomycotes were only rarely met with and were found only on plates incubated at 22°C. (S.N. A.)
ABSTRACTS 119 Millk secretion studies with Newzealand Romney Ewes. BARNICOAT, C. R., LOGAN, A. G., and GRANT A. I. (1949). J. Agric. cult. Sci. 39, 44 THE authors have determined the milk yields of over 200 New Zealand Romney ewes, and the factors affecting milk yield by allowing the lambs to suckle usually six times during a 24 hours period and weighing the lambs on a balance sensitive to 1/4 oz. before and after every feed. It was found that there was fair, agreement between the yields estimated on two occasions with one day's rest between each. Usually 8 or more experimental milkings were carried out during each ewe's lactation cycle of approximately 12 weeks with one week's interval between two consecutive recordings at the beginning of the lactation and at 10 to 14 days interval later on. From the curve obtained by plotting these milk yields against the period of lactation, the milk yield for any other period was obtained. It was observed that the milk yield per animal per day varied from 23 to 73 oz. with an average of about 4 lb. for 100 ewes. The yields of ewes with twin lambs were about 3 higher than those of ewes with single lambs. The milk yield of 6 year old ewes was found to be 15 per cent higher than that of 2 year old ewes. The corre- lation coefficient between the live weight and milk yield was not significant. Ewes lambed in the beginning of September were found to have the maximum milk yields. The low yields of early lambers is attributed to the quantity and quality of the pasture, and that of late lambers to the quality of the pasture available immediately before and during lactation. Suckling by twin lambs produced more milk. Lambs from ewes on a low plane of nutrition were of a lower birth weight. Nutrition during lactation was found to be more important than nutrition during late preg- nancy in determining milk yield. But maximum yield is obtained only by liberal feeding during late pregnancy and throughout lactation. The fat content of the milk of these ewes was found to be high (usually above 7.0 per cent) with considerable variation from milking and from day to day. (T. M. P.) Observations on efficacy of Vitamin supplements for New Born Calves. ERR, R. E. SCOTT, G. W., NORTON C. L. and Morrow K. S. (1949). J. Anim. Sci. 8, 3, 425, 431 THE findings indicate, superficially at least, that massive supplementation of Vitamin A and D on the day of birth should not be expected to compensate for inadequate care and housing of calves, neither it tends to reduce incidence of cold, pneumonia, scours and death losses, on tests under a wide variety of conditions. Special pellets with different markings containing 250,000 I. U. of vitamin A, 50,000 I. U. of vitamin D and 500 mg. of niacin and white placebo pellets were alter- nately fed on the day of birth to 347 calves located on 59 farms in Washington, Rhode Islands and New Hampshire and their records on cold pneumonia and death losses were maintained. There was no difference in the incidence of scours ; 31.7 per cent of the calves supplemented with A and D on the day of birth scoured as compared to 32.3 per cent when no supplement was given. The mean blood plasma vitamin A level of 32 experimental Holstien calves was 11.06 micrograms per 100 ml. of plasma as compared to 9.78 for 36 control Holstien calves at 46 and 47 days of age respectively.
120 ABSTRACTS Only 9.38 per cent of 32 experimental Holstien calves had blood plasma vitamin A values below 7.00 micrograms per 100 ml. of plasma whereas 25.0 per cent of the 36 controls were in level of 9 micrograms and over per 100 ml. Blood plasma vitamin D values on 4 composite samples were approximately 2.5 times higher in experimental calves as compared to control calves. (D. N.) The Relationship of Production of Heifers Milked Prepartum to the Composition of Colostrum. VANLANDTNGHAM, A. H. WEAKLEY JR. C. E. ACKERMAN R.A. AND GEORGE HYATT JR. (1949). J. Dairy Sci. XXXII (6) 559-564 IN this study the total nitrogen, casein nitrogen and the non-casein nitrogen have been used to compare the composition of colostrum with that of normal milk. Only 16 Ayrshire heifers were divided into two equal groups upon the basis of expected dates of parturition, every other animal being assigned to each group. One group was handled in the usual way while the other group was milked for a period of 3 to 18 days averaging 10 days prepartum. Total production before calving for prepartum milked heifers varied from 2 to 142 lb. and on the day before parturition ranged from 0.1 to 24.3 lb. with an average of 10.2 lb. The total nitrogen and non-casein nitrogen of the milk produced on the day of parturition for the heifers not milked prepartum averaged 2.34 and 1.34 gm. per 100 ml. respectively whereas from the heifers milked prepartum averaged 1.13 and 0.50 gm. per 100 ml respectively. The non-casein nitrogen amounted to 57.3 per cent of the total. Nitrogen for the first group of heifers but only 39.1 per cent for the second group of heifers milked prepartum. The total nitrogen and non- casein nitrogen in the heifers prepartum-milked on the day of calving were depen- dent on the level of production and the total amount produced before parturition. Heifers producing appreciable quantities of prepartum colostrum produced normal-appearing milk at the time of parturition. (R. S.) Developments in the Heat-treatment of Milk Aspects. ROWLANDS A. (1950). J. Seol. Dairy. Tech. 3. 213. 224 THE bacteriological principles involved in the heat-treatment of milk are dis- cussed under the heads (i) milk as an agent in the spread of disease to humans (ii) time-temperature relationship in pasteurisation (iii) H.T.S.T. pasteurisation and destruction of pathogens (iv) thermoduric bacteria in pasteurised milk (v) pasteuri- sation and keeping quality and (vi) thermophilic organisms. The pathogenic bacteria present in milk have been broadly classified into two groups, viz., whether they are of bovine or of human origin. According to the author the former group of organisms are those present in milk at the time of drawing while the latter is made up of organisms contaminating milk at different stages of handling. Apart from the usually occurring pathogenic bacteria of bovine origin mention is made of Rickellsia birneti the caustive organism for a new disease known as Q-fever.
ABSTRACTS 121 From a detailed discussion of the various principles underlying the fixation of time-temperature combinations for pasteurisation the author concludes that treating milk at 138°F. for 30 minutes, 140°F. for 20 minutes, 145°F. for 5 to 10 minutes, 150°F. for 2 to 5 minutes or 160°F. for 12 seconds will completely destroy tubercle bacilii. The time-temperature combinations employed in the H.T.S.T. method have been shown to provide a fairly large margin of safety because of the additional heating and holding involved therein. The effectiveness of pasteurisation as a method for reducing the bacterial content of milk is according to the author entirely dependant on the quality of raw milk. It is asserted that large numbers of thermoduric organisms contaminated through poor cleaning and sterilisation of dairy farm utensils generally render pasteurisation less effective. In view of the fact that assessment of bacterial quality of pasteurised milk by determination of colony count is apt to be vitiated by the initial incidence of thermoduric organisms the author has advocated the use of ½ hour methylene blue reduction test for the purpose. Under the head ' Pasteurisation and keeping quality ' the importance of post- pasteurisation contamination in the spoilage of bottled milk is discussed in detail. The author is of the opinion that the majority of the thermoduric organisms are not so very detrimental to the keeping quality of processed milk as the addition of coli- form organisms or actively souring streptococci at later stages. The significance of spore formers in the spoilage of milk is dealt in detail and mention is made of the fact that some spore formers stimulate acid production by lactic streptococci. The incidence of Bacillus Cereus and Mycoides122 ABSTRACTS to level off at about 4 to 5 per gm. The carotenoids of milk closely followed the carotenoid level of pasture herbage and this was especially true when the pasture carotenoid level was below 250 per gm. The steady level of milk vitamin A and its lesser dependence on pasture carotenoids is attributed to the influence of the liver stores and the conversion of carotene to vitamin A. (A. K.) Sterilised Milk. KEELING P. G. (1950). J. Soc. Dairy Tech. 3, 264-71 THE paper includes the official description of the product, a brief history of the development of the sterilised milk industry and a detailed discussion on the individual steps involved in the manufacture of product. The principles under- lying the technique of manufacture are outlined as : (i) Supply of good quality milk that has not been previously heat-treated. (ii) Correct timing of arrival of milk to be related to the processing periods. (iii) Processing of milk in the order. (a) Removal of all foreign matter by centrifugations at a temperature of 80 to 110°F. (b) Flash heating to 170°±5°F to ensure the elimination of coliforms and to prepare for homogenisation. (c) Filling the homogenised milk into hot sterile bottles. (d) In-bottle sterilisation either by manually operated outfit or in continuous auto-sterilisers. The modern designs of tubular or plate flash heaters vis-a-vis the sterilised milk industry have been discussed and the need for bearing in mind the importance of complete accessability for cleaning while chosing the right type of flash heaters and homogenisers is stressed. The bacteriological aspects involved in the storage and distribution of sterilised milk with special reference to thermoduric organisms has been briefly discussed. The author has also assessed the conflicting medical opinion on the nutritive value of the product. Sterilisation is pointed out to cause a slight lowering of the biological value of protein together with a reduction in the vitamins B1 and C. Notwithstanding these losses in nutritive quality the value of sterilised milk as a food can not be questioned owing to other exigent grounds such as its bacteriological purity and long keeping quality.

REVIEW SWINE PRODUCTION BY W. E. CARROL AND J. L. KRIDER (Published by New York Mc Graw-Hill Book Co. Inc. 1950, P. 498, illustrated, $5,00) MC GRAW-HILL has published a new book on Swine Production written by two men with very wide training and experience in the field. The book is one of the McGraw-Hill series in the Agricultural Sciences of which R. A. Brink is Consulting Editor. The text consists of four main parts. They deal with organisation establishing a swine enterprise, management, and feed as factors in the cost of production of swine or swine products. The book is very well printed on heavy glossy paper and is extremely well bound with a very strong cloth cover. It is well illustrated. Numer- ous references are given at the end of all but one of the 23 chapters contained in the book. The authors were associated with the University of Illinois when they prepared this work. The area extending throughout the central midwestern part of the U.S.A., including Illinois, is one of the most intensive swine producing areas in the world. This has been true for several decades. As may be expected, therefore, some of the most noted specialists in the field of swine production are found in the agricultural colleges and research stations there. Carrol and Krider have, in this book, made a notable contribution to the literature on swine production now available to teachers, students and practical swine breeders. Their presentation is as practical as possible, consistent with considering carefully the latest and most technical advances in the various aspects of the field. Other workers are very freely quoted to present facts on as wide a basis as is possible, in a form that is thereby largely indisputable. The text is written for students and breeders in the U. S. A. for this reason it is, in many respects, not directly applicable to India, particularly in reference to prices and price relationships. Nevertheless, the breeding, feeding, disease and general management fundamentals included and discussed are practicable here. Therefore, the book will be found to be of very great value to any one interested in the theory or the practice of swine production in India. (J.N.W.) 123 MGIPCORIGINAL ARTICLES INFLUENCE OF SOLAR RADIATION ON IMMUNITY, 1 By AMRITAMOY MUKERJI,* B.Sc., G.V.Sc, ASSOC. I.V.R.I, Bengal Veterinary College, Belgachia, Calcutta (Received for publication on 1 August, 1950) IN a tropical country like India, of all the environmental factors influencing the animal body it is, obvious that the most important one is the radiant heat of the sun. During the major part of the year, atmospheric air temperature remains high, and therefore, the loss of body heat becomes difficult in animals living under such depressing conditions. The body is constantly producing internal heat in all its metabolic functions and this heat must be dissipated into the surrounding environment. As heat loss becomes difficult, all body functions and resistance to infection are lowered. In contrast to the detrimental influence of the high external temperature on the health and general vitality of the animals, cooler environment acts as a direct stimulant to the general vigour of the animals and increases their power of resistance to infection. There is sufficient experimental evidence that environmental temperatures play a significant role in modifying resistance to infectious diseases. McDowell [1923] studied the effect of different temperatures and humidities on the resistance of rates to a pneumococcus infection and found that animals kept in humid heat are more susceptible to infection of various kinds than those living in a cool environ- ment. Mills [1939] reported that the studies on resistance to infection started in his laboratory by Dr Joseph W. Colvin are providing clear proof that resistance to infection is indeed linked to ease of body, heat loss, and combustion level of the individual. Mice adapted for at least three weeks to 90°F. and 60 per cent relative humidity, succumb with only one-fourth the injected dose of organisms it takes to kill those adapted to 65°F. or, if an intermediate size of dose be injected, then all hot room mice die while all from the cold room survive. Mills and Schmidt [1942] studied the effect of environmental temperatures on resistance to infection and found that there is a marked lowering of resistance to infection in depressive warmth and a stimulation by cool environments. Survival time of mice, after type I pneu- mococcus inoculation is markedly shorter for heat adapted animals than for those kept in a cool environment. Mice kept at 65°F. had a mean survival time of 44.9 hours, those at 75°F. survived 36.3 hours and those at 90°F. only 27.5 hours. They contended that a reduction in phagocytic activity is probably a dominant factor in the lowered resistance brought about by environmental warmth. Mills [1939] remarked that with exposure to typhoid infection, a higher degree of immunity seems to be required for safety in tropical regions than in temperate coolness. * Condensed from the thesis submitted on 22 September, 1947, for the Associateship of the Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar Mukhteswar. 125
126 INFLUENCE OF SOLAR RADIATION ON IMMUNITY, I [Vol. XXI, Part III, Repetition of vaccine injections is insisted upon every 2 years for the maintenance of effective protection in tropical lands, but in middle temperate regions vaccine protection is supposed to last five to seven years. This fact is also borne out by the results of immunization against rinderpest with goat tissue vaccine in the plains and hill regions of India. Evidence is available to show that the duration of immunity conferred by a single dose of goat tissue vaccine is longer in the cattle of Mukteswar, which has a temperate climate due to its high altitude (7,500 feet above sea level), than in the cattle of Izatnagar, which has a tropical climate. Perhaps this can be attributed to the difference in the environmental temperatures prevailing in these two places. More recently, Neitz and Riemerschmid [1944] carried out experiments at Onderstepoort which clearly indicate the detrimental influence of solar radiation on the course of ' Blue tongue' in sheep. The sheep exposed to the sun showed distinctly severer reactions than those kept in the shade. Strongest and most fatal reactions were observed during summer months when the sheep were exposed to the sun and got sufficiently photosensitized, but exposure during winter months has practically no influence on the course of the disease. The authors considered probable that the above findings, which were in respect of a certain infectious virus disease, viz. ' blue-tongue' in sheep, might also be true in respect of other diseases. From the foregoing, it is evident that no effort was made by any worker to study the influence of solar radiation on the activity of the antibody-forming mecha- nism as estimated by serum reactions, and it is with this end in view that the present work is concerned. Two antigens were selected for the experiment. One of them was Staphylococcus toxoid for immunizing rabbits. The end-point in the Staphylococcus toxin-antitoxin titration using rabbit erythocytes as indicator being very sharp and definite, this method was employed for estimating the speci- fic antibodies of the immune sera. The other antigen selected was goat tissue vaccine for immunization against rinderpest. Specific antibodies of the rinderpest immune sera were estimated by the standard method which has been evolved and adopted at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute. The object of selecting rinderpest is that it is the most common and widespread cattle disease in India. Goat tissue vaccine, which is being extensively used all over India as an immuniz- ing agent, is known to produce mild reactions in the indigenous breeds of cattle which are more resistant to the disease than the imported breeds and the hill cattle in India. The results of the immunization are usually satisfactory under controlled conditions, i.e., when the animals are tied up in the stalls after vaccination and kept under observation during the period of immunization, but unfavourable reports are very often received from the field indicating severe reactions in some of the immunized cattle and sometimes early breakdown of the immunity conferred. These unfavourable results are usually attributed to the faulty technique adopted by the operator in the field or to the deterioration of the vaccine during its transit from the place of manufacture to the field. But the most striking difference between the stall and field conditions being the absence or presence of direct solar radiation, one should think it probable that this environmental factor may be responsible for the difference of results of immunization in cattle kept in these two situations. Staphylococcus toxiod was selected as an immunizing agent in rabbits. Specific antitoxin developed in the immune sera was estimated and the difference between
September, 1951] AMRITAMOY MUKERJI 127 the means of the two groups, viz. ' sun' and ' shade ' was compared for antitoxin units per c.c. Selection of bacteria According to Minett [1937], a strain of Staphylococcus aureus, which is highly toxigenic and haemolytic for rabbit erthrocytes at a dilution of at least 1 in 1000, is considered suitable for immunizing animals, because the toxoid prepared from the toxin of such a strain could be depended upon to stimulate a good antitoxic res- ponse in the immunized animals. Hence a large number of strains of S. aureus, available at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, were examined systematically for their respective cultural, biochemical, haemolytic, dermone- crotic and lethal properties and finally strain No. 11 was selected for the work. Haemolytic property Preparation of toxin. Dolman [1933] described the general methods for the preparation of staphylococcus toxin, but several modifications have been made by different workers, specially in respect of the medium used. A partial CO2 atmosphere is generally used in the production of staphylococcus toxin and there- fore some kind of anaerobic culture apparatus is necessary. The methods reported by Dolman [1933], Burnet [1929], Jamieson and Powell [1934], Parish and co- workers [1932] refer to a McIntosh and Fildes anaerobic apparatus or a Novy jar. A semi-synthetic infusion-free medium was proposed by Eirkbride, Bertheksen and Clark [1931] for the production of diptheria toxin and this semi-synthetic medium was used after slight modification by Leonard and Holm [1935] for the production of staphylococcus toxin. Minett [1936] adopted a method closely similar to that of Burnet [1931] for the preparation of staphylococcus toxin and this method with slight modification was adopted by the author with satisfactory results. According to this method, cultures were grown for 36 hours at 37°C. on plates of 0.8 per cent beef heart agar, pH 7.4, containing one per cent Witte peptone and 0.25 per cent NaCl in an atmosphere containing 25 per cent CO2. After 36 hours' incubation, when the lid of the anaerobic jar was opened, a peculiar disagreeable characteristic odour was evident signifying the formation of a good toxin. One c.c. sterile nor- mal saline was then added to each plate of 10 c.c. agar, the semisolid medium was thoroughly chopped and filtered through a Buchner's funnel, the filtrate was centri- fuged at high speed128 INFLUENCE OF SOLAR RADIATION ON IMMUNITY, I [Vol. XXI, Part III, postulated the presence of a multiplicity of haemolysins, because he found no paral- lelism between the titres shown by different toxins against the erythrocytes of different species of animals. It remained for Glenny and Stevens [1935] to show that some filtrates contained two antigenically separate substances which they called Alpha toxin and Beta toxin. Their Alpha toxin haemolysed rabbit and sheep corpuscles at 37°C., their Beta toxin haemolysed sheep corpuscles only when their preliminary incubation at 37°C. was followed by cooling, and did not lyse rabbit corpuscles. The toxin formed by the method, described above, from strain No. 11 was found to be of Alpha variety, as it haemolysed rabbit and sheep corpuscles at 37°C. Direct haemolysin titrations. Method adopted by Minett [1936] was followed. In 10 per cent of broth saline 1 c.c. of a series of dilutions (physiological saline con- taining 10 per cent of beef infusion broth) was mixed with 0.1 c.c. of 10 per cent suspension of washed rabbit red cells and the tubes incubated in a water bath at 37°C. for one hour, with a shake after the first 30 minutes. Readings were taken just before removing the tubes from the bath and finally after one hour's standing on the bench. The tubes were shaken after each reading. The end-point was taken as the dilution showing ' partial' or approximately 50 per cent haemolysis, as judged by the colour of prepared standard and the minimal haemolytic dose (M.H.D.) of toxin was determined by adopting the ' Burnet unit of haemolysin' September, 1951] AMRITAMOY MUKERJI 129 absorption varying from 78 to 83 per cent. Another point of interest in the coat colour is that the black coat also helps loss of heat specially when the animal is kept in cold. The larger the surface of the body, the greater the amount of absorption of solar radiation. Adult animals were preferred to the young, as the response to antigen for the antibody formation is greater in the former than in the latter. Lastly, the males were considered more suitable than the females for inducing photosensitization during the period of exposure to the sun, as the thermogenesis is more perfect in the males than in the females. But the stock of rabbits available at the time of the experiment at Mukteswar was limited and, therefore, the choice was restricted. NATURAL ANTITOXIN Parish, O'Meara and Clark [1934] and Dolman and Kitching [1935] found antitoxin in the blood of normal rabbits and guinea pigs. But, Bryce and Burnet [1932] found none in the domestic rabbits. Since the occurrence of natural anti- toxin plays an important part in the development of active immunity, it was con- sidered necessary to discover whether the rabbits selected for the experiment contained any amount of detectable antitoxin. The haemolytic method of estimating staphylococcus antitoxin was used in the investigation described below: The rabbits were bled for serum. A few tubes were arranged in the rack. Each tube contained 0.5c.c. of double dilution of serum. 0.5 c.c. containing 2 M.H.D. of toxin (original 3,200 M.H.D. per c.c.) was added to each tube. The tubes after standing on the bench for 30 minutes were incubatd in a water bath at 37 °C. for 30 minutes. The rack was then removed from the bath and 0.1 c.c. of 10 per cent suspension of washed rabbit red cells was added to each tube, and the rack was return- ed to the bath for an hour, being shaken at the end of the first half hour. Reading was taken before removing the rack from the bath and finally after one hour's stand- ing on the bench. All the tubes were found to be completely haemolysed, thus indicating the absence of any detectable amount of antitoxin in the blood serum of normal rabbits selected for immunization with alum-precipitated staphylo- coccus toxoid. Immunization of rabbits with alum-precipitated toxoid Smith [1936] conducted experiments on groups of rabbits and gave two spaced injections of staphylococcus toxoid @ 2.5 c.c. per kg. body weight. The injections were spaced 3 to 4 weeks apart and the animals were bled 14 days after the 2nd injection. The degree of immunity conferred, as judged by the level of antitoxin in the immune blood serum of the rabbits was satisfactory. He further worked on the comparative efficiency of the different routes of injection and found that the subcutaneous route proved to be 5.7 times more efficient than the same dose given intravenously. Having regard to the conclusive findings, noted above, all the 20 rabbits were injected subcutaneously with two doses of toxoid @ 2.5 c.c. per kg. body weight at an interval of 3 weeks and 14 days after the 2nd injection all the rabbits were bled for immune serum. Besides formation of a small swelling at the site of injection in a few rabbits, no other systemic disturbance was noticed. The local swelling disappeared in a week's time without any treatment.
130 INFLUENCE OF SOLAR RADIATION ON IMMUNITY, I [Vol. XXI, Part III, Grouping. Efforts were made to distribute as equitably as possible equal number of rabbits of similar colour, size and sex in the two groups, viz.' shade' and ' sun' (vide Table I). Shade group, consisting of 10 rabbits, was kept in a fairly dark and cool room throughout the total period of immunization and was never allowed to be exposed to the sun during this period. Sun group, consisting of 10 rabbits, was also accommodated in the same room in separate cages under identical conditions during the total period of immunization except for the short periods in the day time when it was exposed to the sun in a place adjacent to the room.

A preliminary experiment with half a dozen rabbits from a separate stock was conducted before the actual experi- ment with a view to ascertain the extent to which the rabbits got photosensitized in a given time when exposed to the sun. It was found that 2 hours' continuous exposure to the sun from 10 a.m. to 12 a.m. when the air temperature near the place of exposure was just above 70°F. was sufficient to increase the body temperature of the rabbits by 3°F. to 5°F. above their normal recorded in the shade immediately before the exposure and induced distressing symptoms, such as, rapid respiration, panting, screaming and running about in the cage. Experience gained from the finding of this preliminary experiment was valuable for regulating the daily period of exposure of the sun group. Duration of exposure. Sun group rabbits were exposed to the sun twice daily, once between 9-30 a.m. to 11-30 a.m. and again between 2-30 p.m. to 3-30 p.m. exposure, specially between 9-30 a.m. to 11-30 a.m. was not given continuously. They were exposed for 50 minutes in the beginning and then were removed to the shade for about 20 minutes for cooling down, again they were exposed for another 50 minutes and then were finally removed to the room. (This process of disconti- nuous heating prevented the rabbits from being overheated with consequent distressing symptoms). During 2-30 p.m. to 3-30 p.m. the exposure was generally continuous and this did not produce any distressing symptoms). Daily exposure of the above duration was given to the sun group for 10 successive days after each injection. The weather at Mukteswar during the first 10 days' exposure remained on the whole clear, but during the second period of exposure from 17 to 26 June, the weather conditions were unsatisfactory owing to the onset of the monsoon result- ing in frequent interference with the daily routine of expsoure. Effect of exposure. While the average normal body temperature of all the rabbits belonging to both the groups recorded in the room at 9 a.m. was found to be about 103°F., continuous exposure to the sun from 9-30 a.m. for 50 minutes induced progressive rise of body temperature 2 to 3°F. over the normal recorded before exposure, accelerated respiration and tendency to panting. These symp- toms rapidly disappeared soon after the return of the rabbits to shade. After an interval of 20 minutes they were again exposed to the sun continuously for another 50 minutes during which symptoms very similar to those described above were noticed. Afternoon exposure between 2-30 p.m. to 3-30 p.m. was generally con- tinuous and the effect of photosensitization was mild. Rabbits with dark-brown coat colour were much more quickly photosensitized than the whites and the admixtures of brown and white. Recording of body temperature of the sun group before, during and after the exposure was always preceded by recording of body temperature of the shade group. Hyperthermia and consequent increase in the rate of respiration of the sun group rabbits due to the effects of exposure to the sun were sharply contrasted with the normal body temperature and the rate of respiration of the shade group rabbits during the corresponding period. Meteorological observations Dry and wet bulb thermometer readings were recorded in the rabbit house daily at 9-30 a.m. i.e., just before the sun group was removed outside for exposure.
132 INFLUENCE OF SOLAR RADIATION ON IMMUNITY, I [Vol. XXI, Part III, At 10-30 a.m. readings were recorded outside the rabbit house where sun group was exposed to the sun. At one hour interval, readings were again recorded in the rabbit house and by this time the sun group rabbits were also removed to the rabbit house. Similarly, in the afternoon, readings were recorded first in the rabbit house before the sun group was brought out for exposure, and then in the exposed place one hour later, i.e., just before the sun group was returned to the rabbit house. These readings provided an indication of the air temperature and the relative humi- dity of the air inside the room and in the exposed place outside before, during and after the daily period of exposure. The meteorological data recorded at different times of the day during the period of the experiment are given in Table II.

In those cases where 50 per cent haemolysis was not visible, an interpolated reading was taken, i.e., the titre was calculated at the arithmetic mean of the preceding and the following tubes. It was found that the serum of rabbit No. 458 gave a titre of 1/64, which was highest among the lot of six samples of sera titrated. Since only 1/64 c.c. of serum of rabbit No. 458 just neutralized 32 M.H.D. of toxin, 1 c.c. of serum contained 64 units of antitoxin. This unitage was considered as the author's provisional standard unit of antitoxin and against this provisional standard, sera of unknown strength were titrated. Determination of LH dose of toxin The term LH dose refers to the amount of toxin neutralized by one unit of standard antitoxin, i.e., by ' LH dose ' is meant that quantity of toxin, which, when mixed with one unit of antitoxin, produces partial lysis of rabbit erythrocytes after one hour at 37°C. (1) Lh dose of toxin was determined by mixing decreasing quantities of the toxin with one full unit of provisional standard antitoxin. A volume of 0.5 c.c. of 50 per cent falling dilution of toxin and 0.5 c.c. of provisional standard serum containing one unit of antitoxin were added in each tube. (2) Lh/10 dose of toxin was determined by mixing 0.5 c.c. of 50 per cent falling dilution of toxin and 0.5 c.c. of provisional standard serum containing l/10th unit of antitoxin in each tube. Preliminary titra- tions at Lh level for antitoxin contents in unknown sera revealed that with the majority of the samples of sera, this dose was not suitable and considered to be stronger than necessary. All the samples of unknown rabbit sera were then titarated against LH/10 dose of toxin. Out of 18 samples of unknown sera titrated, unitages of 16 samples were higher than one, but in two samples the unitages were found to be less than one. These two samples were titrated against Lh/50 dose of toxin, which was determined by mixing 0.5 c.c. of 50 per cent falling dilution of toxin and 0.5 c.c. of provisional standard serum containing l/50th unit of antitoxin in each tube. In the final titrations for antitoxin contents in unknown sera, all the 18 samples were titrated on the same day and repeated on four successive days in order to find out the mean antitoxin unit per c.c.

SUMMARY The influence of solar radiation on the formation of specific antibodies in the rabbits hyperimmunized with alum-precipitated staphylococcus toxoid was studied. The ' sun group ' was exposed to the sun daily for a brief period for 10 days after each injection. The ' shade group ' was kept indoors and not exposed to the sun during the corresponding period. Both the groups were bled for immune sera 14 days after the second injection. The interval between the two injections was 21 days. The results of titrations revealed that the mean antitoxin unit per c.c. of immune serum was more in the ' shade group ' than in the ' sun group '. On statis- tical analysis, the difference between the means of the two groups compared for antitoxin, units per c.c. was, however, found to be non-significant.

I., Bengal Veterinary College, Belgachia, Calcutta (Received for publication on 13 March, 1951) (With ten-text figures) A SERIES of experiments were conducted at Izatnagar in the different seasons of the year to study the influence of solar radiation on the course of rinderpest and the resulting immunity in Kumaon hill-bulls, plains buffaloes and goats. General procedure adopted for all the experiments with goat tissue vaccine on different species of animals Selection of animals. The chief criteria for the selection of animals were coat colour, size, age and sex. The importance of these factors has already been clearly indicated in the Part I dealing with rabbits. Pre-experimental management. The selected animals were allowed grazing in the morning from sun rise uptil 9 a.m. and again in the evening for some time before dusk. During the intervening period, they were tied up in a shed. The animals were kept under this kind of management for about 2 weeks. Therefore, in the pre-experimental stage, they were not allowed to be exposed to the direct rays of the sun during the hot hours of the day and consequently they were not heat adapted before coming under the experiment. Pre-experimental data and grouping. Some of the important constituents of blood, viz.138 INFLUENCE OF SOLAR RADIATION ON IMMUNITY, II [Vol. XXI, Part III. Immunization with goat tissue vaccine. All the selected animals, belonging to both the Groups, were inoculated subcutaneously each with 1 c.c. of 1 per cent saline emulsion of the spleen tissue. Inoculation was always done in the evening. Anti-rinderpest serum or a re-inforcing dose of goat tissue vaccine was not given to any animal during the whole period of the experiment. Effect of a single dose of goat tissue vaccine alone on the animal body under sun and shade was observed. Description of the animal shed and place for exposure The shed, where the experimental animals were sheltered, was constructed of thatching materials. The inside of the shed was fairly dark and cool. Arrangement for tying up the Sun Group animals during the period of the exposure was made in the open space about ten yards from the shed. As the direction of the wind at Izatnagar is generally from west to east and vice-versa, a 'tattie' (thatched wall) all about 8 ft. high and 30 ft. long was constructed across the direction of the wind and two similar tatties of same height and length were constructed at right angles one on each side of the central tattie. The whole enclosure thus resembled the capital letter H. Provision for tying up the animals was made by pitching the wooden pegs on either side of the central tattie, distance between the pegs being wide enough to prevent overshadowing of any animal by the other. The animals were tied up on the eastern side of the central tattie when the direction of the wind was from the west, and the arrangement for tying was reversed when the direction of the wind was from the opposite side. All these arrangements were done with a view to prevent the cooling effect of the wind on the animal body during the period of the exposure. Maximum degree of photosensitization in the minimum time was thus obtained by exposing the animals to the sun within this enclosure. Exposure and general management of the animals during the immunizing period Exposure of the Sun group commenced from the next day of the vaccination and was continued daily for a period of about 8 to 10 days covering the negative and positive phases of the period of immunization. The duration of exposure on each day was determined by the atomospheric air temperature and the degree of tolerance of the animals exposed to the sun. They were removed to the shed before the distressing symptoms appeared. During the period of exposure, water was not offered to the animals. They were also not allowed to lie down on the ground- This latter precaution was taken for preventing the unequal absorption of the solar radiation through the body surface. During this period of 8 to 10 days after vaccination, the Shade Group was kept in the shed. Both the groups were watered twice a day, once early in the morning and again in the evening. Animals received a little walking exercise at the time of watering. In order to avoid digestive disturbances due to any sudden change of fodder and concentrates, the ration with which the animals were fed during the pre-experimental period, was continued during the period of immunization. This procedure eliminated any possible complication with the digestive disturbances associated with the course of rinderpest. Observations during the immunizing period.

(2) Body temperature and respiration count per minute of the 'Shade' and 'Sun' group animals were recorded daily at one hour intervals from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and continued throughout the period of the experiment. As a convention, each time readings of the shade group animals were taken first. Rate of increase of body temperature and respiration count in the 'Sun group' animals during the period of exposure could thus be compared with the normal readings in the 'Shade group' animals kept inside the shed.

Immunity test. Both the groups were tested for the resulting immunity three months after their vaccination with 5 c.c. dose of virulent hill-bull blood virus keeping one healthy hill-bull as control. The latter received the same dose of the virus as the test animals. Reactions, if any, in both the groups were compared for any evidence of the breakdown of immunity. The experiment was over after the Immunity test.

Among the other six hill-bulls which were protected with 'Shade group serum', 4 died of rinderpest, but the remaining 2 survived, thus proving that the protective power of the 'Shade group serum' was better than that of the 'Sun group serum'. Inspite of the fact that 2 out of 6 hill- bulls survived, the gross potency of the 'Shade group serum' was also calculated as zero in accordance with the rules for the evaluation of potency of immune serum.

The common character of dye storage possessed by cells of this type has led many observers and particularly Aschoff [1924], to regard them as an inte- grated system of cells fulfilling a particular bodily function. He has termed this as ' reticulo-endothelial system '. Topley and Wilson [1936] observed 'The avail- able evidence indicates that the cells of the ' reticulo-endothelial system', which are known to remove injected antigenic material from the blood and tissue fluids play an essential part in the production of anti-bodies. Whether these cells them- selves produce the antibodies in their final and complete form, or whether their role is confined to the temporary retention of antigen and its subsequent liberation in an altered or unaltered state, the actual synthesis of antibodies occurring else- where, cannot yet be determined. The present indications are that the part played by the ' reticulo-endothelial system ' is not confined to the retention and release of unaltered antigens'. Various hypotheses have been put forward from time to time with regard to the conception of antibodies and the method of their formation. Ehrich's conception of antibodies was that they were shed 'cell receptors'. The antigen gained effective contact with the cell by becoming anchored, through specific chemical groupings of its own to specific chemical groupings on 'side- chains' carried by the tissue cells. Breinl and Haurowitz [1930] and Mudd [1932] put forward another hypothesis of the method of antibody formation. This hypo- thesis assumes that all antibodies are globulins which get synthesized under the
164 INFLUENCE OF SOLAR RADIATION ON IMMUNITY, II [Vol. XXI, Part III, directing influence of the antigen. This influence is exerted through a union, physical or chemical, between the peptides or amino acids and the active groupings of the antigen during the globulin synthesis. Ehrich and Harris [1942] pointed out that the reticulo-endothelial theory of antibody formation is not supported by evidence in its entirety. Evidence is available that the lymphocytes have some- thing to do with the gamma globulins and antibodies in that they either store or produce globulins. Harris et al. [1945] demonstrated that the lymph node anti- bodies are contained largely in the lymphocytes during antibody formation. The lymphocyte functions as a vehicle for the antibody. Chase et al. [1946] observed that antibodies of the blood are generally present in the beta or gamma globulin fractions of the serum proteins. Gamma globulin is a normal constituent of lympho- cytes. The release of gamma globulin from lymphocytes as a consequence of aug- mented pituitary-adrenal cortical secretion suggested that the adrenal cortical steroids might influence antibody levels in the serum. This hypothesis received support from the fact that lymphoid tissue has long been considered a site of anti- body production. The rate of release of the globulin from lymphocytes is, there- fore, directly connected with the amount of pituitary and adrenal secretions. Explaining the phenomenon of 'lymphocytic dissolution', the same workers observ- ed that this release is produced by the removal of cytoplasm from the lymphocytes and is accentuated by increased amounts of adrenal cortical hormone. The con- stituents of lymphocyte cytoplasm are thereby released to the lymph and reach the circulation. Thus, by this mechanism, adrenal cortical stimulation results in an elevated gamma globulin level in normal serum and an increased antibody con- centration in the immunized animal. Cannon [1944] remarked 'Evidence appears conclusive that an antibody is a globulin which has been specifically modified by an antigen'. The effects of environmental temperature and humidity on the power of re- sistance of the body against infectious diseases have already been dealt with in the Introductory Chapter in Part I. In the series of experiments conducted by the author the experimental groups were daily exposed to the direct rays of the sun for a period of 8 to 10 days after vaccination. The influence of solar radiation on the antibodySeptember, 1951] AMRITAMOY MUKHERJI 165 finally manifested in the resulting immunity acquired by the animal. The precise nature of modus operandi of any single factor is, however, not known. When the animal is exposed to the sun, the superficial blood vessels are dilated and the tempera- ture of dermis and deeper layers of tissues is raised; the heart beat and respiration count are increased and consequently the circulation of blood becomes rapid. The heated blood from the peripheral vessels, while passing through the internal organs, also raises the temperature of the latter and this process of 'heating up of the body' continues during the period of exposure to the sun. This action is purely physical. In this process, it is very likely that the functional activity of first-line defence mechanism, which consists of lymph glands, becomes impaired and the lymphocytes, which originate from these glands and are regraded as the precursors of the anti- bodies, also get inactivated. In the exposed animals, histiocytes and reticular cells, which are so plentiful in the dermis and other tissues beneath it, are probably inactivated due to the exposure to the solar radiation. Therefore, their response to the antigen becomes weaker, as a result of which less number of antibodies are formed. Reverse is the case in the 'Shade group' animals which were kept in a cooler environment and due to this, the histiocytes and reticular cells probably responded more satisfactorily to the antigen with consequent release of more number of antibodies in the circulation. In all cases, the passage of the antigen from the primary site of infection to the blood stream is mainly by way of the lymphatics and the histiocyte depots in the regional lymphatic glands play a prominent part in the retention and subsequent release of the antigen, altered or unaltered, into the circulation. The injected antigens at this stage are probably further attenuated and it is likely that this is accompanied by partial loss of their antigenic properties. When the body temperature is cooler, certain physiological changes take place. Under this condition, the endocrinal secretions, more specially those of thyroid, pituitary and adrenals, are augmented and reverse is the rule when the body tempera- ture gets hotter. Therefore, the rate of 'lymphocytic166 INFLUENCE OF SOLAR RADIATION ON IMMUNITY, II [Vol. XXI, Part III, immunized hill-bulls of the 1st experiment lived, and perhaps, this wide difference of environmental temperature under which two experiments were carried out might be responsible for the difference in the rate of release of the antibody in the circulation. Besides the factors enumerated above, which apparently exert their detri- mental influence on the production of antibodies when the animal is exposed to the sun, thyroid and parathyroid secretions and certain biochemical changes in the tissues also play an important role in this process. The chief action of thyroid secretion is on the basal metabolism, i.e., on the general itssue system, and the parathyroid secretion, in conjunction with vitamin D, helps the assimilation of minerals, chiefly Ca and P. These secretions are increased when the animal is in a cooler environment and are diminished when the animal is in a hotter environment. Therefore, the beneficial functions of these secretions are diminished in the 'Sun group' animals during the period of the antibody formation, whereas, they are enhanced in the 'Shade group' animals during the same period. This alone explains the important role of these secretions in the general body resistance to the infectious diseases. With a view to study this phenomenon in the experimental animals, some of the blood constituents, e.g.,September, 1951] AMRITAMOY MUKHERJI 167 group' animals. This might be attributed to the probable detrimental influence of the solar radiation on the first-line defence mechanism in the exposed animals. The antigen, instead of being subjected to the activity of the local tissue cells, e.g., histiocytes, reticular cells, etc., pass on unchecked to the blood circulation and sub- sequently to the liver, spleen and other tissues and give rise to much pronounced reactions. Whereas in the 'Shade group', probably due to the cooler atmospheric temperature in which the animals lived, the first-line of defence is more active and the antigen is acted upon by the glandular and regional tissue cells and then allowed to pass on to the circulation, thus giving rise to milder reactions as compared with the 'Sun group'. The severity of the reaction, however, bears no relationship to the concentration of antibodies in the circulation as a result of immunization. The effect of solar radiation on the incubation period of rinderpest was observed and was found that in case of both the experiments on hill-bulls, the incubation period in the 'Sun group' was less than that in the ' Shade group', but in case of the other two experiments with buffaloes and goats, the incubation period in both the groups was the same. Thus, no conclusion can be drawn with regard to this unless more number of experiments are conducted under sun and shade. A comparison of the body weight of both the groups before vaccination and after the reaction period revealed that the 'Sun group' animals suffered more loss of body weight after the reaction period than the 'Shade group' animals. The highly significant decrease in the body weight of the 'Sun group' animals after the reaction period in all the four experiments on rinderpest was directly due to the severity of the reactions, which again was primarily attributed to the detrimental influence of solar radiation on the exposed animals. A comparison between the mortality figures among the reactors of both the groups during the reaction and convalescent periods revealed that more number of deaths occurred among the 'Sun group reactors'. Lastly, the influence of solar radiation on the resulting immunity was studied in all the four experiments on rinderpest and very interesting results were obtained. The immunity test was done in all the experiments three months after vaccination. In the first exepriemnt with hill-bulls, where the percentage of potency of immune serum of the 'Sun group' was found to be 8.2 as against 42.2 of the 'Shade group' the immunity test revealed that half the number of the animals belonging to the 'Sun group' were partially immune, while the remaining animals of the 'Sun group' and all the animals of the 'Shade group' were found to be immune. This partial breakdown of immunity in some of the animals of the 'Sun group' might be attributed to the initial low concentration of antibodies in the immune serum as revealed by the potency test. In the subsequent experiment with hill-bulls, the percentage of potency of immune sera of both the groups was found to be zero. The immunity test revealed that only 2 hill-bulls of the 'Shade group' were still immune and out of the remaining 6 hill-bulls, 3 died of rinderpest due to complete breakdown of the conferred immunity and 3 suffered from rinderpest but recovered thus indicating a partial breakdown of immunity at the end of three months after vaccination. Out of 7 hill-bulls of the 'Sun group', 4 died of rinderpest and 3 were found to be partially immune as they suffered from rinderpest but recovered. The breakdown of immunity, partial or complete three months after vaccination, was evidently due to the very poor quality of serum as proved by the potency test.
168 INFLUENCE OF SOLAR RADIATION ON IMMUNITY, II [Vol. XXI, Part III, Immunity tests on buffaloes and goats revealed that they were all immune at the end of three months after vaccination. This was, perhaps, due to the higher per- centage of potency of immune sera of both the groups, sun and shade, as found out by the potency tests. It appears, there exists a direct relation between the results of the potency tests and immunity tests. The results of the experiments, together with the interpretations, given above indicate that the solar radiation has detrimental influence on the formation of anti- bodies in the immunized animals exposed to the sun for a few days after vaccina tion. Systematic investigation into this important problem has not been taken up so far by any worker. The line now opened up by the author offers great oppor- tunities for other workers to pursue it further. SUMMARY Hill-bulls, buffaloes and goats were immunized against rinderpest with a single dose of goat tissue vaccine and from the next day of vaccination, the 'Sun group' was daily exposed to the sun for a period of about 8 to 10 days and the duration of exposure on each day was regulated by observing the rise of body temperature and respiration count of the exposed animals. They were transferred back to the shed before distressing symptoms appeared. The ' Shade group ' was kept inside the shed and was not exposed to the sun during the corresponding period. The influence of Solar radiation on the formation of specific antibodies, as judged by the potency test of the immune sera, was studied. Both the groups were bled for immune sera on the 21st day after vaccination. Two composite mixtures of sera one for each group were obtained. The results of the potency tests in three out of four experi- ments revealed that the percentage of potency of the ' Shade group serum ' was more when compared with that of the ' Sun group serum'. In the fourth experi- ment, the percentage of potency of immune sera of both the groups was found to be equal. The influence of solar radiation was also studied on (a) the incubation period, (6) the clinical symptoms, (c) the mortality and (d) the immunity conferred. With regard to the incubation period it was observed that in two out of four experiments the incubation period of the 'Sun group' was shorter than that of the ' Shade group ': but in case of other two experiments, the incubation period was the same for both the groups. In all the four experiments on rinderpest, the severity of the reactions in the 'Sun group' was much more pronounced than that in the ' Shade group'. Total number of deaths directly due to rinderpest or its after-effects among the reactors of the 'Sun group' was more than the total number of deaths among the reactors of the ' Shade group '. Immunity tests conducted three months after vaccination revealed that in the first experiment with hill-bulls, there was a partial breakdown of immunity in the 50 per cent of the animals of the 'Sun group'. All the other animals of the same experiment were found to be immune. In the second experiment with hill-bulls, there was a complete breakdown of the immunity resulting in death in 3 animals of the ' Shade group ' and 4 animals of the 'Sun group', and there was a partial breakdown of immunity in 3 animals on each side (recovered after mild attack of rinderpest). Only 2 animals of the ' Shade group ' were found to be still immune (The percentage of potency of immune sera of the 'Sun group' of the first experiment and of both the groups of the second expreiment
September, 1951] AMRITAMOY MUKHERJI 169 with hill-bulls was vary low, as revealed by the serum tests). The immunity tests on buffaloes and goats revealed that they were all immune at the end of 3 months after vaccination. (The percentage of potency of the immune sera of buffaloes and goats was higher in both the groups.) Some of the blood constituents, e.g.ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION IN SHEEP AND GOATS AT IZATNAGAR* By S. GUHA, M. L. KOHLI AND P. BHATTACHARYA, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 27 June 1950) IN India, there are about 41 million sheep and 50 million goats. Of the large farm animals, they are perhaps the thriftiest and least expensive to rear and maintain. Their distribution is mostly amongst the poorer class of people and their major sustenance comes from stray grazing. Extensive grazing areas are required to provide sufficient pasturage for maintaining these large numbers. These animals supply a large variety of readily marketable products, viz., milk, meat, wool, 'mohair' hair, manure and leather, etc. But the production capacity of Indian sheep and goats is very low and the scope and need for improvement are being increasingly appreciated. Improvement in their productive capacity will yield not only more profit to those engaged in their husbandry but will also reduce pressure on land by making economic retention of smaller number possible. Improvement in sheep and goats is being carried out in many parts of the country by selective breeding within the breed, grading with indigenous superior breeds and also to some extent by crossing and grading indigenous stock with foreign breeds. Of the foreign breeds of sheep, Merino has been more extensively used than others and Angora amongst goats. Considerable difficulty is, however, encountered in importing a large number of Meriono rams and Angora bucks. There is also a great paucity of good quality sires of the indigenous breeds, and the economic use of semen of sires of superior genetic make up has become an urgent necessity. This can best be achieved through an extensive use of artificial insemination which has already become an accepted method of breeding in many countries. In Russia, for example, 14,500,000 ewes were inseminated in 1939 with the semen collected from 41,274 rams, giving an average of one ram for every 280 ewes [Ozin, 1939]. By natural service only 50 ewes could be served by one ram. In this* paper are pre- sented the results and experiences obtained from preliminary investigations into the artificial insemination work with sheep and goats carried out at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, under a scheme of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. Training of rams and bucks The use of artificial vagina for collecting semen for artificial insemination in sheep and goats has met with the same success as in large farm animals. In sheep, * This paper was read at the 34th Session of the Indian Science Congress, 1947 171
172 ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION IN SHEEP AND GOATS [Vol. XXI, Part III, it has been found to be comparatively easier to work with this technique of collec- tion than with the other method like induction by electric stimulation [Gunn, 1936], and it was adopted throughout the investigations. The details of the technique as given by Walton [1938] was followed and to induce condition reflex, all the collec- tions were made on a specially constructed service crate similar to the one used by Walton. The training of the males was done by using anoestrous females from the very beginning. The bucks and rams to be trained were led to the females of the respective species confined in the crates. Each was allowed fifteen minutes time with the female and then removed. Thirteen bucks and sixteen rams were trained by this method. The number of trials needed for the training varied from one to thirty-one. Regular collections could be made from all these males once they started responding to this method. One goat started mounting after eighteen daily trials and also gave thrusts in the artificial vagina without, however, ejaculating semen. Various attempts were made to induce ejaculation by changing the pres- sure and temperature of the artificial vagina but without success. When allowed natural service, the animal was found to liberate live sperms. Insemination of the female The insemination was done with the help of a Russian model vaginal speculum and all-glass syringe connected to a long ebonite nozzle [Walton, 1938] or a strong glass pipette. The blades of the speculum were well lubricated with liquid paraffin and introduced into the vagina. After the cervix was located, the tip of the nozzle or pipette was introduced into it and the requisite quantity of semen was deposited into the cervix with the help of the syringe or in the case of the pipette by blowing at the other end. The advantage of this method is that the operator can see if the semen on deposition into the cervix is expelled by the animal. Genital diseases can also be spotted during inseminations. The speculum and the nozzle should be disinfected before each insemination. Altogether 198 ewes and 134 goats were inseminated. Out of these, a few goats and a number of sheep were inseminated at Hissar. A number of goats from the neighbouring villages were also available. Single insemination was done at one heat period in all the animals. Workers in other countries have obtained varying results between single and more inseminations during the heat period. According to some, a single service gives as good results as two or more inseminations, but Kelley [1937] found better results with several services. In artificial insemination work on high grade Merino sheep in Kenya somewhat better results were obtained by two or more inseminations [Anderson, 1945]. According to Kirillov [1938] only those ewes which show a heat period of more than twenty-four hours should be inseminated twice. Little difference in pregnancy was noted amongst ewes insemi- nated once and those inseminated two or three times by Lopyrin and Loginova [1939] in their observations on multiple inseminations in 2,582 ewes. Fractions of the total ejaculate varying from 1/2 to 1/65 in sheep and from 1/2 to 1/53 in goats were tried in inseminating ewes and does and success was obtained with fractions upto 1/40 in sheep and 1/32 in goats.

Fresh semen either neat or diluted was used for inseminating a large number of sheep and goats and in a number of cases semen preserved for various periods was also used.

It was also found difficult to spot out the ewes on heat at the right time as no vasectomised ram was available. The percentage of pregnancy in the experimental flock of sheep at Izatnagar, however, was 86.37. A very great varia- tion in the percentage of conception in ewes has been observed by workers in other countries. In Russia, where by far the largest number of ewes have been insemi- nated, even as high an average conception rate as 97 per cent has been obtained [Kersin, 1937]. In Kenya colony, the lambing percentage varied from 47 to 79 in different years [Anderson, 1943]. He ascribed the low conception rate to certain equipmental procedure and lack of knowledge of the optimum season of breeding. In South Africa, Quinlan, Mare and Claassens [1936] obtained 33 to 56 per cent fertility by a single insemination into the cervix of the ewe at one heat period. Poorer results than this have been obtained by Gunn [1936] and Kelley [1937] in Australia. The inseminations carried out by Gunn were under rather unfavour- able conditions. It may be mentioned here that the inseminations at Hissar were performed in the open field under very unfavourable atmospheric conditions, the days being very hot and windy. The number of inseminations required per conception as worked out from the animals found pregnant showed that 86.7 per cent of the ewes conceived by the first insemination, 7.1 per cent by the second insemination, and 6.1 per cent by the third or subsequent insemination. The figures for goat were 78.4, 11.8 and 9.6 per cent respectively. In Argentina, out of 108 ewes inseminated [Ross, 1942], 52 became pregnant at the first insemination, 29 at the second, 21 at the third and 6 not at all.

Examination of the reproductive organs often revealed cases of silent heat. In the flocks of sheep and goat at Izat- nagar vasectomised males were used to detect heat in females with better result. In conclusion, it may be emphasised that an extensive utilization of artificial insemination in sheep and goat breeding, if introduced in India, would greatly benefit the livestock industry. As already mentioned, there is a great scarcity of high quality sires, to make up which, inferior males have to be used to a large extent. There is, therefore, immense scope for the adoption of artificial insemination in sheep and goat production. The results obtained in these experiments have given encouraging indications regarding its applicability on an extensive scale.

AN APPRAISAL OF FACTORS AFFECTING FERTILITY IN SHEEP* By R. N. DESAI, Assistant Professor, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Banaras Hindu University and L. M. Winters, Professor of Animal Husbandry, University of Minnesota (Received for publication on 9 January 1951) (With Plate XIII) ANY temporary or permanent loss in fertility in live-stock is not only a liability to the present day farmer but also a loss of the genetic material. It affects the efficiency of selection, because the proportion of the animals available for breed- ing purpose is reduced. Satisfactory reproduction is the basic requirement for the progress in animal breeding as it gives a larger population from which a given number of animals with a desirable combination of different characters can be selected. It is well recognized that fertility has a hereditary basis but it is highly influenced by factors other than heredity. There is a great variability in fertility in sheep. A large portion of this is due to the complex phenomena with which these non- hereditary factors act on fertility. If the proportion of this variability could be measured and the relative importance of these factors could be established, the selection for the twinning tendency in sheep would be more effective. In general, a breeding female gradually increases in fertility from her first breeding and usually reaches the peak early in her full maturity. Asdell and Willman [1941] suggested that fecundity is low during the early life of the female animal, rises to its peak and then declines with increasing age. Hammond [1941] pointed out that the submaximal fertility corresponds to the time during which the skeleton is completing its full growth, suggested that the frequency of the multiple births in sheep increases with age up to maturity and then declines. Marshall and Potts [1921] stated that to get the largest number of twins, ewes should gain at least seven pounds during breeding seasons. Clark [1934] was of the same opinion by saying that there is a definite relationship between the increase in body weight and the number of ova liberated in sheep. Terril and Stoeher [1939] found in range sheep that the condition of the ewes during breeding, has a close relationship with the percentage of lambs born. Kiser and Christagau [1940] reported that twin born ewes consistently give higher percentage of lambs than the single born ewes. An attempt was made in this study to identify factors affecting fertility and to determine the proportion of the total variance for which they are responsible. *Paper No. 2690 Scientific Journal Series of the Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Sta- tions.

178 AN APPRAISAL OF FACTORS AFFECTING FERTILITY IN SHEEP [Vol. XXI, Part III, Sources of data and methods of analysis The data used for this study were gathered at four branch stations of the University of Minnesota Experiment Station. The breeds of sheep at the different branch stations and the crossed lines were treated as separate lines for this study. The system of management and feeding at these stations was more or less similar. Most of the selection for fertility was based on the twin born lambs and on the consistency of performance of the ewes from year to year. For the study of the factors affecting the lambing percentage, the problem was broken down into different analyses, depending upon the available records. They were as follows: 1. An analysis of the effects of age of the ewes. 2. An analysis of the effects of sires and the type of birth, etc. 3. The estimation of the relative importance of the different factors, by esti- mating the proportions of the variations due to these factors to the total variation. The first analysis was made by using covariance method as outlined by Snedecor [1946]. The second and third analyses were made by the analysis of variance method according to Snedecor. The phrase 'lambing average' has been frequently used in this paper with the meaningPLATE XIII Indian J. Vet. Sci., Vol. XXI, Part III [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]
September, 1951.] R. N. DESAI 179 Some of the crossed lines were not old enough to provide complete perform- ance data. There appear to be significant differences between the lambing averages of the lines, but these differences are confounded with stations, since all the lines are not represented at all the sub-stations. These differences, therefore, defy interpretations. There appear to be significant differences between second, third and fourth year lambings within lines, as well as in the pooled total. To study this, the lamb- ing records from the second to the seventh year of age are included. A ewe very rarely lambs in this experiment in its first year and is culled out from the flock after its seventh year of age. This is generally the productive period of a ewe and so it is taken into consideration for this study. The linear and curvilinear regressions of lambing averages on age were cal- culated by the multiple covariance method as illustrated by Snedecor [1946]. This analysis included all the lines, even though some of them were incomplete in their performance up to the seventh year. The classification of the data was kept simple by grouping them by lines and dams within lines to eliminate the differences due to lines and dams. Both of the regressions were calculated from within dams within lines by sums of squares and products. Both of the regressions are highly significant, but the curvilinear regression is significantly better fitted to the data than the linear regression. In Plate XIII, fig. A is given a graph of the curvilinear regression (ct) without eliminating the difference due to lines; (wd) after eliminating these differences and (ob) the observed lamb- ing averages for the different ages at the time of lambing. The curvilinear regression calculated from the data, excluding the incomplete records of some of the lines are given in Plate I, fig. B. In this graph the regressions and the observed lambing averages for the different ages show the same trend. The regression from within dams within lines differences (wd) shows that the lambing average rises with the increase in age up to the fifth year and then gradually declines. At the seventh year it shows a rapid drop. In other words, the rate of increase in lambing average gradually decreases as the age increases. The rapid decline at the seventh year, or afterwards, is not of much significance, because of the very low number of records. Year effects. Since the lambings occur in the same season at one year intervals, it is suspected that the age effect may be influenced by year effects. To eliminate this effect, partial regressions of lambing average on age and year were calculated from the same data. Both the partial regressions (one, by x1.x2=.1405, the effect of age on lambing average when year effect is removed and the other, byx2 .x1 =180 AN APPRAISAL OF FACTORS AFFECTING FERTILITY IN SHEEP [Vol. XXI, Part III, year. This change of .1405 lamb in lambing average on account of the increase in age is practically the same as the average difference of .1403 lamb between the expected lambing averages from second to seventh year of age, according to the curvilinear regression calculated from within ewes within line differences. This age effect leads to the consideration that if the majority of the ewes in the flock could be of age at which maximum lambing percentage is expected, the flock would give the maximum economic returns. The relationship of the lambing average and the flock average age from year to year is found to be .9958, indicating that the lambing percentage is affected by the flock average age. Weight of ewe. It is generally recognized that by having breeding ewes in thrifty condition and gaining in weight (flushing) before breeding, the lamb crop is increased. The data in this case did not lend themselves for this study. Other factors. Other equally important factors which need careful considera- tion to determine their relative importance for the effectiveness of selection for fertility are: the influence of sire, the maternal age effect on the performance of the daughters, the type of birth and its influence on the lambing average and lastly the individual differences in fertility. For the study of these factors, the records of 1,368 lambings from 420 ewes born from eight lines on the experiment stations were classified into different sire groups. Each of these sire groups was further classified into two main divisions. (a) The ewes born to mature dams and (6) those born to young dams. The dams four years of age and above were considered as mature and those that were two or three years of age were treated as young. Each of these divisions was further subdivided into twin born and single born ewes. Under each of these subdivisions the lambing records of each of the ewes were arranged against their age. The analysis of variance of 1,368 lambings with their test of significance is given in Table II. TABLE II Analysis of variance of lambings from ewes born on the station Source of variance d.f.

Line effects. There are highly significant differences between lines for the lamb- ing averages. Some of these differences may be confounded with station differences which could not be separated out. The sums of squares of deviations, 6.1602, as shown in Table II, is 1.40 per cent of the total sums of squares. Sire effects. The results of this study indicate that the differences due to the sires within the line are not significant. This is mainly because of the fact that the whole data are from the selected ewes. The ewes that fall within a certain standard of selection are retained and those below that standard are culled out. Naturally the deviation that would exist due to the sires has been removed by selection. The sum of squares of deviations of 20.2067 due to 64 sires, contribute 4.66 per cent of the within line differences or 4.59 per cent of the total variations. Maternal age effect on the daughter's performance. The differences in lambing percentage due to age, as previously shown, are highly significant. Possibly they may be due to the changes in the endocrine functions which occur according to age. Can such changes in a dam affect the performance of her daughter ! To study this aspect, the lambing records were grouped, as already mentioned, on the basis of whether they were born to dams when they were mature or young. The differences between these two groups, due to the age of the dams are highly significant. The sums of squares of deviations of 16.0037 from their mean are 3.69 per cent of the total differences within lines, or 3.64 per cent of the total differences. The question arises, naturally, as to the direction of these differences, whether they are in favour of the mature dams or of the young dams. The data classified for this purpose by age of dam and daughter are given in Table III. These differences show that the young dams have some influence on their daughters in giving higher lambing per- centage than those born to mature dams.

182 AN APPRAISAL OF FACTORS AFFECTING FERTILITY IN SHEEP [Vol. XXI, Part III, daughters is also consistently indicated when the twin born daughters from the mature dams are compared with those from the young dams. The same is true in the case of the single born daughters.

The same trend in favour of the young dams was noticed for each of the stations. When the grouping of the data was based on the different lines, it was clearly demonstrated in the lines where the number of records was high. To test the validity of this effect further, the lambing records of the daughters born to the same dam at different ages were pooled together for every station. The number of ewes having such daughters with records, went down very markedly. Even then the lambing percentage of the daughters born to their mothers when young was higher than that of those born to them when mature. It was also apparent that most of the daughters from the young dams only came into selection Thus according to these data, there appears to be a trend indicating that ewes born to young dams have given higher percentage of lamb crop. On the average, the daughters from the young dams have given according to the data .0933 lambs more than those by daughters from mature mothers Effect of type of birth. When 1,613 lambings were classified by type of birth and by age, the twin born ewes consistently showed higher percentage of lamb crop at every year of age. The lambing percentages of these two groups are given in Table VI by age.

DESAI 185 functions come to perfection at maturity, the differences between these two groups are clearly defined in Plate XIII. The mean difference between them is .12 lambs. The behaviour of these two groups after the sixth-year of age, as in Plate XIII, fig. (C), is not conclusive because of the small numbers of records at this age. TABLE VI Lambing percentage of twin and single born ewes Type of birth Performance Age of ewes in years 2 3 4 5 6 7 Twin born Lambing per cent 123 134 158 151 152 161 Number 346 239 166 122 71 34 Single born Lambing per cent 113 128 127 124 136 182 Number 240 172 119 62 33 9 The differences in lambing percentages of the two groups are highly significant when tested by the analysis of variance method and are only significant at 5 per cent level when tested by x2 test. The sums of squares of deviations of 6.7127 due to the type of birth is 1.55 per cent of the within line differences, or 1.53 per cent of the total. The study of the performances of the twin and single born ewes indicate that the former not only give higher percentage of lamb crop but also the higher percentage of triplets than the single born ewes. The differences in triplets produc- tions, though not statistically significant, are close to the probability at 5 per cent level. At the same time, it was found that the number of still births and deaths at birth are significantly more in the case of twin born ewes than in the single born ones. These results agree very well with those of other workers like Kiser and Christagau [1940]. Every ewe, except in the case of identical twins, is a different genotype and would react differently with the environment. Similarly fertility would be affected at various stages by many physiological factors. It is, therefore, expected that individual ewe would be a source of large variations. As the data did not allow for the analysis to study the individual variation within sire groups, these were estimated within lines. The sums of squares of 166.9774 between ewes within lines is 38.47 per cent of the within line variations. This shows that the selection of the ewes must be very carefully made on individual basis in order to increase the lambing percentage of the flock. Age effect The effect of age was also analysed by the method of analysis of variance. The sums of squares of deviations of 28.1426 due to age of ewes is 6.48 per cent of the within line differences, or 6.39 per cent of the total. This is very close to the per- centage of 6.21 shown by the regression method when the effect of year is removed.
186 AN APPRAISAL OF FACTORS AFFECTING FERTILITY IN SHEEP [Vol. XXI, Part III, Effect of inbreeding Many workers have investigated the effects of inbreeding of dam on fertility in many of the smaller species of animals. Usually there is not much inbreeding practiced in sheep and cattle. According to Winters et al. [1947] the average in- breeding coefficient of sheep at the Minnesota Experiment Station may not have been raised more than 4 per cent as a result of inbreeding from 1936 to 1941. Prediction of lambings In order to find out if prediction of future lambings could be made from the first or first and second lambings combined, two correlation coefficients were calculated. One between the second year lambings vs. third, fourth and fifth year lambings combined, and the other between the second and third year lambings together vs. fourth and fifth year lambings. Both of the correlations are highly significant, but the difference between the two correlations is not significant. Therefore, it can be concluded that the predictions can be made from the second year lambing as well as from the second and third year lambings. However, it would be safer to predict from the latter than from the former, even though the difference between the two correla- tions is not significant. DISCUSSION The effects due to various factors may be true but the adjustment that may be made for them should account for a substantial portion of the total variation to effectively increase the genetic gain. The expected gain for one cycle of selection is directly proportional to [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] [Cockerham, 1949] where 'a' is the fraction of the total variation adjusted for. According to this study the expected gains by adjusting for the factors influencing lambing average are given in Table VII in the order of their importance.

September, 1951] R. N. DESAI 187 The reduction in the total sum of squares due to the variations in the ewes within lines is 37.94 per cent. Such a large reduction indicates that the selection of the individual ewe is of very great importance to increase fertility in sheep. If this could be reduced by careful selection, a 26.94 per cent increase in the genetic gain can be expected. Under average farm conditions it is very difficult to make very close observations on individual ewes so as to facilitate the selection, still a part of it could be reduced to make some progress. The reduction due to age is 6.21 per cent but due to the negative effect of the years, it is reduced to 3.7 per cent. If such year to year changes in the environment could be controlled conveniently the age effect would be pronounced to its maximum level of 6.21 per cent. To keep the flock at the maximum productive level, it appears that any ewe showing a tendency for lowered fertility after the fifth year may be immediately culled out and at the same time very rigid selection of the young ewes may be made on the basis of their first and second lambings and type of birth, etc. Inspite of the fact that the sire effect on the lambing percentage has been esti- mated on the records of the selected ewes, the reduction due to this factor is quite large. This would indicate the possibility of increasing fertility further through the selection of suitable sires for the flock. Next in order of importance is the maternal age effect on the performance of daughters. The findings for this factor are controversial. If they could be taken as conclusive ones, the procedure of selection would be slightly changed. As a matter of fact, in absence of proper explanation and some more evidence in that res- pect, they cannot be taken as such. It can only be suspected that possibly such an effect may be due to some physiological factors influencing the growing foetus in the intra-uterine stage or during the period of nursing the young ones. According to these data, the reduction in the sums of squares is 3.64 per cent and selection for it would bring about 1.87 per cent increase in the genetic gain. The effect of the type of birth on fertility accounts for only 1.53 per cent reduc- tion of the total variations and indicates the possibility of .77 per cent increase in the genetic gain. This effect is also estimated on the records of the selected stock. It would be evident from the numbers in the classifications that the single born group has been very rigidly selected. In absence of such selection, the differences bet- ween these two groups might have been widened and the effects of twin born group on fertility would have been possibly more pronounced. In addition to this, the number of still births and other deaths at the time of lambing are significantly more in the twin born group. There may be various causes for this mortality. If some of the environmental causes could be controlled the inheritance of the multiple births would be more effective. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The effects of age and year on fertility of sheep were studied from 2,696 lambing records from 962 ewes. So also the effects of sires, the maternal age effect of the performance of daughters, and the effect of the type of birth with their relative importance in selection were studied from 1,368 lambing records of 412 ewes.
188 AN APPRAISAL OF FACTORS AFFECTING FERTILITY IN SHEEP [Vol. XXI, Part III. The lambing percentage rises as the age increases up to the fifth year of age and then gradually declines at an average rate of .1403 lamb, when the year effect is ignored. The sires within the line did not show significant differences in the lambing average of their selected daughters. Still the variation that they have caused is quite high as compared with that due to other factors. It was found that the daughters born to dams when young, produced .0933 more lambs than those born to mothers when mature. The reasons for such an effect are not known. However, it may be suspected to be due to some physiological functions of dams having influence on the growing young one either in the intra- uterine stage or during nursing. There are highly significant differences in the lambing averages of the ewes within the lines, emphasizing the importance of the individual ewe selection. The twin born ewes give birth, on the average, to .12 more lambs than the single born ewes. They also show more consistency in their higher performance throughout their productive life. The frequency of triplets production is also higher in the twin born group than in the single born The prediction of the future lambings can be done from the first two lambings at the second and third year of age.

Winters, Professor of Animal Husbandry, University of Minnesota. (Received for publication on January 1951) SOMETIMES it may be possible to increase the production or performance of an animal by partially controlling the environment but to do so in its entirety is practically impossible. On the contrary the improvement in heredity is generally a permanent investment and mainly depends upon the genetic variability. The phenotypic variance is due to both genotypic and environmental differences or, in other words, heritable and non-heritable variations. Heritability may be defined as the heritable fraction of the total variance i.e., [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]. Generally it is expressed as the percentage of the total phenotypic variations. So also it is a description of a particular characteristic in a certain population at some definite moment. It can be raised or lowered by any breeding system or by changing the environment. The methods of estimating it are based upon the degree to which the closely related animals resemble each other more than the less closely related animals do. A dependable estimate of heritability and repeatability of fertility is useful in deciding upon the breeding plans which are most likely to bring about the genetic improvement. The repeatability is the coefficient of correlation between the succeeding records made by the same animal in the same herd. Generally it is believed that heritability of fertility within a breed or line is very small [Wright, 1922]. Very little work is done on it in sheep. Recently Cockerham [1949] estimated it to be .10±.05, and repeatability .06±.03. Joseph [1932] found correlations of .21 and .31 in two groups between the twinning tendency of the ewes and their daughters. The findings of Wentworth [1913] and Kiser and Christagau [1940] also indicate similar limits of its estimates. The purpose of this study was to estimate the heritability and repeatability of fertility in sheep on the University of Minnesota Experiment Station so that they could be used for planning a future breeding programme to improve the twining tendency in the flocks. MATERIALS AND METHODS The data used for this study were taken from the records of the University of Minnesota Experiment Station. The management and the feeding, etc., of the flocks were more or less similar. The estimates of heritability for fertility were made by intra-sire regression of lambing averages of offsprings on those of the dams. Repeatability was also estimated by the intra-class correlation of lambing averages by the method as outlined by Snedecor [1946]. *Paper no. 2689 Scientific Journal Series of the Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Sta- tions.

192 THE INHERITANCE OF FERTILITY IN SHEEP [Vol. XXI, Part III, ESTIMATES OF HERITABILITY Estimates of heritability for lambing averages were made by two procedures for using the data under the method of intra-sire regression of offspring on dam. In one procedure, the lambings of dam and daughters were tallied within a sire group. For example, if daughter has only first and second lambings, then only first and second lambings of dam were taken for forming a pair. If another daughter from the same dam and sire has only second and third lambings, then only second and third lambings of dam were taken for another pair. This, naturally, gave as many pairs as the number of the daughters under each sire group. Of course, in many cases, some of the data had to be dropped out simply because the lambings could not be paired. The records from 48 ewes were left out in this way. According to the second procedure, the different lambings of dam and the lambings of all the daughters from the same dam and sire were averaged to form one pair. When a dam had daughters from more than one sire, the dam's average was used in forming a separate pair for each of the sires. In this case, the number of pairs did not exceed the number of dams. This procedure has an advantage of using the all data for the computation of regressions. The intra-sire regressions were calculated from within sire groups sums of squares and products. The dams and daughters with their lambing averages by lines are given in Table 1. TABLE 1 Numbers and lambing averages of dams and daughters in intra-sire regression seperated by lines September, 1951] R. N. DESAI 193 Though the intra-sire regressions for lines varied widely, the differences were not significant. They were, therefore, pooled. When n records were averaged for each dam in computation of intra-sire regres- sion, the relationship of heritability to regression is : [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] but as the number of records vary among the dams, the relationship of H to b is: [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] where m is the hormonic mean [Snedecor, 1946] of the number of the records per ewe. An approximation of the sampling variance of heritability, V(H), when H is derived in the above manner is given by the following formula : [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] The heritability estimates by lines and stations are presented in Table II. TABLE II Heritability estimates by lines and stations Line Procedure 1 Procedure 2 S. E. Shrop 194 THE INHERITANCE OF FERTILITY IN SHEEP [Vol XXI, Part III. The heritabilities, according to procedure 1, show a wide range among lines. Due to such a range it is rather difficult to draw any conclusions. The overall heritability by this procedure is 3.06 per cent and is lower than 7.36 per cent esti- mated by the second procedure. The following interpretations are based on the results obtained from the use of procedure 2. There is some consistency in the heritability figures calculated by the second procedure, except in the case of three lines. If the data of the dam-daughter pairs of these three lines are studied, the following reasons may be suggested as to the causes of the negative results. Some of the sire groups have daughters with only one record, as against 3.25 records in some cases and 3.50 in others for dams. Such comparisons introduce bias in the results under some sire groups where the number of records of dams and daughters is nearly equal, the number of dam-daughter pairs is very low, ranging from 4 to 6. It is logical to conclude, therefore, that sampling errors are responsible for the negative estimates of heritability. These negative estimates therefore, have been considered as zero. ESTIMATES OF REPEATABILITY Repeatability for lambing average was estimated by the intra-class correlation method from 2,696 lambing records from 962 ewes. In order to eliminate the differ- ences due to lines, ewes and age of ewes, the multiple co-variance method was used and intra-class correlation was calculated by the formula as outlined by Snedecor [1946]. r = m1 September, 1951] R.

The estimate of repeatability of fertility is the total genetic variance and may include some of the permanent effects of environment. Consequently, it is expected to be as high, or higher, than the heritability estimate. The estimate of repeatability .0498 ±. 0263 is smaller than the overall estimate of heritability .0736 ±. 0152 according to the second procedure of analysis. Since the standard error for repeatability is high, such a low estimate is due to the sam- pling error. Nevertheless, the estimates are reasonably close to each other. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The estimates of heritability were made by the intra-sire regression of lambing records of offsprings on those of dams. The overall estimate was found to be .0736 ±.0152. Such a low estimate may be due to the lack of control on the environmental variations or it may be due to a low frequency of genes affecting the genetic variability. Similarly, the repeatability for lambing average was estimated from the same data. It was found to be .0498 ±. 0263. It is lower than the heritability figures. Since the genetic make-up of any individual does not change during its life repeatabi- lity should be at least as large as the heritability. It can be larger even, because the permanent effects of environment would also be sometimes included in it. The standard error of it indicates that it is in error. However, both the estimates are reasonably close to each other. The overall heritability indicates that the most effective method of improving fertility would be to cross the lines under consideration with some other outstan- ding lines or perhaps with other breeds of known high fertility in order to bring in new genes for fertility. If no other line or breed is available that has a higher degree of fertility, it is possible that crossing with a breed of the same degree of fertility would be useful. The hope would be that the recombination of genes might prove beneficial. The estimates of heritability by stations also substantiate this interpretation. REFERENCES Cockerham, Clark, (1949).

VERMA, Animal Husbandry Department, Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow (Received for publication on 18 May 1948) PASTEURELLOSIS is comparatively an uncommon infectious disease in swine which usually complicates other infectious diseases like swine fever and Foot and Mouth disease. Pasteurellosis has been reported from many parts of Europe, Ireland, America and S. Africa. The reported information in India is rare, perhaps for the reason that the swine breeding industry has not received the attention that it deserves in this country. Shahi [1937] recorded an outbreak of this disease at Keventer's piggery, Aligarh. The object of this paper is to record another such outbreak which occurred among large white Yorkshire pigs of Government Farm, Babugarh (District Meerut) in June 1947. Clinical symptoms The condition was clinically characterised by dullness, high temperature (105 to 110°F.), inability to stand, heavy breathing and groaning at intervals. The death in majority of cases was observed to supervene in 24 hours. In these cases bloody discharge was noticed from anus just before death. In others death was noticed even within six hours. One breeding sow, however, lingered on for 19 days but later died. Mostly pigs between four months and two years were affected but some older animals were also affected. In all 29 deaths were recorded in a herd of 156 pigs. Postmortem lesions The general condition of the animals which died after short duration of illness was good. Skin over the abdomen, scrotum and inner side of the thighs was purplish in colour. Lungs were highly congested and in some cases even areas of consolida- tion were present. The mucosa in the fundus portion of the stomach was swollen and highly congested. Intestinal mucosa showed patchy congestion. Mesenteric lymph glands were congested and oedematous. The carcase of breeding sow which died of illness extending over 19 days was highly emaciated and several bedsores were present on the body. Areas of lung tissue were hepatised and showed necrotic patches. Thoracic lymph glands were enlarged. Bacteriology Examination of blood smears from several dead animals showed varying number of bipolar organisms, which could be isolated in pure culture from heart blood. The organism was gram negative and produced acid and no gas in peptone water containing 0.5 per cent glucose, laevulose, saccharose, raffinose, mannitol or sorbitol. It was unable to ferment arabinose, xylose, maltose, lactose, inulin, dextrin, dulcite, 197
198 PASTEURELLOSIS IN SWINE [Vol. XXI, Part III, salicin, adonite and glycerol. Production of H2S on lead acetate medium was faint. Ammonia was slightly produced. Methylene blue was reduced and catalase test was strongly positive. V. P. and M. R. tests were negative. In peptone media it produced indol. A 24 hours old broth culture died in 10 minutes at 58°C. and in two minutes at 60°C. Formalin in 0.5 per cent concentration killed a 24 hours old broth culture within ten minutes. Rabbits and G. pigs inoculated subcutaneously or intraperitoneally with saline suspension of liver, spleen and lungs or culture suspension died within 18 hours. Crow died in 20 hours after subcutaneous injection of 0.5 c.c. of culture suspension. Buffalo calf infected by subcutaneous route with 5 c.c. of culture suspension showed high fever and inflammatory oedema at the point of injection and died in 72 hours. Postmortem examination revealed severe gastro-enterities. Mesenteric lymph glands were congested and oedematous. The organisms could be easily isolated from heart blood of all these animals. Goat showed a rise of temperature to 106.6°F on the day following subcutaneous injection of 2 c.c. of culture suspension but did not die. Duck and fowl were found resistant to the infection. Two country pigs showed no reaction when subcutaneous injection of saline suspension of material, from a carcase or culture isolated from it was given to them. The organism isolated from dead carcases was also identified as 'Pasteurella' at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar. Control measures All the measures regarding segregation and disinfection were taken and the entire herd was immediately inoculated with anti-haemorrhagic septicaemia serum. The housing conditions were improved. Later all the animals were vaccinated with formalized agar wash vaccine prepared from the organisms isolated during the outbreak. No cases were reported that year after prophylactic inoculations. DISCUSSION Such an outbreak was practically unknown in the piggery. Prior to the appear- ance of the disease no animals were purchased from outside, and the possibility of the disease having been introudced from outside was obviously eliminated. The biological tests excluded the co-existence of any other infecting agent. Adverse climatic conditions as well as bad housing appear to be the predisposing factors. It may be pointed out that most of the deaths occurred in those paddocks which were open and had no protection against sun or rain. Moreover, the season was extremely hot at that time. SUMMARY Record is made of an outbreak of Haemorrhagic septicaemia in pigs at Govern- ment Farm, Babugarh. The diagnosis was confirmed by bacteriological as well as biological tests. The outbreak was controlled by the use of anti-haemorrhagic septicaemia serum and improvement of housing conditions.

TEOSINTE BY M. R. PANIKKAR, M.Sc., Senior Technical Assistant, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, Delhi (Received for publication on 30 March 1951) TEOSINTE (Euchlaena mexiana Schrad. Syn. Reana luxurians Dur.) or buffalo grass called makchari in vernacular, belongs to the tribe Mayideae in the sub- family of Panicoidaeae of the natural order Gramineae. It is probably of Central American origin and in the Central Mexican flora it is found solely among maize plants [Roseveare, 1948]. Possibly, the wild ancestor of maize, it is essentially a tropcial grass. Botany. It is a large very succulent strong growing annual grass which tiller profusely gives rise to a number of shoots (some times even 100) to form thick clumps which grow up from 30 cm. to 4 metres under favourable conditions. It has long leaves, which are 5 to 7.5 cm. broad, male spikelets 8 to 9 mm. long crowded in long spikes in a corymb 12 to 25 cm. long, female spikes in the leaf axils, styles very long, protruding from the top of the enclosing sheath. The spike of the female spikelets breaks up at maturity into rhomboidal seed like joints. Nearly allied to maize and resembling it in its tassel of male flowers and broad leaves, it hybridizes with maize. It thrives best under hot humid conditions in rainy tracts on rich soils with periodic manuring. Teosinte, however, cannot stand drought nor frost. The crop is cultivated mainly for fodder which is succulent and nutritious. Horses are fond of it [Blatter and McCann, 1935], while Roberts et al. [1947] note it as relished by all kinds of cattle. Cultivation. Piper [1924]. quoted yields of green fodder in the U.S.A. varying from 9 tons per acre in New Jersey to 50 tons in Lousiana. In spite of this, due to its demand for richer soils for optimum yield, the cultivation of this fodder in the U.S.A. has decreased. In soils of moderate fertility, however, it does not yield so well as jowar. Experience elsewhere showed that it may prove successful in damp warm regions of high humidity and heavy rainfall. For example, in the West Indies, (Dominica), it yielded 12 tons of green fodder per acre and was considered suitable for poor sandy soils ; similarly, in Philippines 26.67 tons per acre was reported. Mann [1920] noted high yields of green fodder in the Assam Valley too. But, on the other hand, in drier climate, with lesser rain, even under irrigation, teosinte gave discouraging performance ; in Rhodesia it was found unsatisfactory, and in Arizona too, it was not successful. Experiments conducted in Poona Agricultural College Farm during the latter part of the 19th century as well as in the first decade of this [1893-1896 and 1913-14], showed that it yields less than jowar and maize and the crop is obtained more slowly. As a rain crop, it gave an average of 5¼ tons of dry fodder. At the same time, it 201
202 TEOSINTE [Vol. XXI, Part III, was suspected to adversely influence the milk yield of cows. But nothing of this necessarily applied to teosinte as a fodder crop in moist, warm, rainy tract, where indeed it may be valuable. For the cultivation of this crop in Western India, seeds should be sown in alter- nate plough furrows using 10 to 15 lb. of seeds per acre and the resulting crop thinned after a month : or it should be dibbled in rows 15 in. apart, both in the rows and between the plants, when only 3 to 4 lb. of seeds per acre would be needed. Piper [1924] recommended planting in hills 4 to 5 ft. apart in rows of the same distance. It should be irrigated if necessary. If grown as a monsoon crop, it will be ready to cut in three months after sowing and second crop can be obtained (usually with irrigation 4 to 7 weeks later). Mann [1920] thinks it not worthwhile keeping the crop for the third and fourth crops, which it may yield. In Northern India, in all about 32 to 35 lb. of seeds are required per acre, which are sown either broadcast or ploughed in or dropped behind the plough (kera). If the crop is sown early in March to April, two to three cuttings, first in May to June, depending upon sowing time and also under conditions of rich soil and liberal irrigation, may be obtained. On the other hand, if it is sown late, at the end of July to August, the crop gives only one cutting which will be ready in 3 to 3½ months (October to November), when there will be scarcity of green fodder. It gives an average yield of 400 md. per acre [Londer, 1949]. Teosinte could be cultivated mixed with legumes (velvet beans or soya beans) which take about the same time to mature. The fodder is coarse and always fed green and not made hay or silage. Unlike maize, where a compact cob is produced, the female inflorescence in the plant consists of a number of strings of seeds covered by glumes and borne at the nodes. And when the crop is grown for seed, the dry stalks are fed to bullocks after the removal of the grains. The seeds ripen in November (in the Punjab). The colour of the ripe seed varies from creamy white to dark brown ; immature seeds though of normal size are white in colour and much lighter. The harvested seed is allowed to dry for a fortnight or so, before thrashing. A good crop may yield 15 md. of seed per acre. The crop is also grown in Southern India. Nutritive quality of fodder In Australia [1910], the green crop completely dried gave the following figures on analysis. Ether extract (oil, etc.) . . . . . . . . . 1.39 Proteids . . . . . . . . . . 7.27 Digestible fibre . . . . . . . . . . 42.55 Nitrogen free extract . . . . . . . . . 11.2 Woody fibre . . . . . . . . . . 27.67 Ash . . . . . . . . . . . 7.03 Sen [1946] too has given its constituents.

At the same time, it compares favourably with maize, jowar and senji in total ash content. Similarly, though it has the lowest crude protein and compares unfavourably with the rest of the fodders given in the table in ether extracts, buffalo grass stands in favourable light with maize and guinea grass in fibre content. In mineral contents, it compares well with jowar, maize and Napier grass in CaO, Napier and senji in MgO, maize, Sudan grass and senji in K2O, while in P2O5 it is comparatively the poorest. Breeding. At the Potchefstroom Agricultural College South Africa, several crosses have been made between maize and teosinte (for high vegetation and yield specially suitable for ensilage and fodder) and a new type, teomaize with vegetation potentialities requiring high soil fertility for full expression has been evolved. In India, selections of a few vigorous types from crosses of teosinte with maize have also been reported by Kumar [1939]. So far the crop has not been observed to have been attacked by insect or fungus pests. CONCLUSION Teosinte is a moderately yielding coarse fodder grass best suited and responding well also in rich soils of hot humid regions with heavy rainfall. Comparing with maize and velvet beans it may be a better yielder, and unlike maize it is less prone to the attack of insect or fungoid pests. At the same time, in soils of moderate fertility it does not yield so well as jowar and its nutritive value is only about 83 per cent of that of jowar fodder. However, it could be advantageously sown late in Northern India, to be ready for fodder in October to November, when there will be scarcity of green fodder. Thus, in spite of its obvious limitations, the importance of teosinte in the pastoral set-up of the country both in the heavy humid areas of North East and South West as well as in the dry North India, could not be overlooked. REFERENCE Anonymous, ABSTRACTS Studies on the Diagnosis of Newcastle Disease and Infectious Bronchitis of Fowls. I. The Hæmagglutination-Inhibition test for the Diagnosis of Newcastle Disease. FABRICANT, J. (1942). Cornell Vet., 39, 202-220 THE author has described the utility of Haemagglutination-Inhibition test in the diagnosis of Newcastle disease and has compared the same with the Serum Neutralization test. A detailed description of the H.I. test has been given. The test was performed by mixing successive dilutions of the virus with a fixed quantity of serum. Even though the technique of the test is essentially same as the official test of the U.S. Bureau of Animal Industry, the following modifications were adopted with advantage : (i) Untreated allantoic fluid was used instead of formalinized virus ; (ii) the tests were incubated at 25°C. before recording the results instead of at room tem- perature ; (iii) a 1 in 40 dilution of the serum was used and not 1 in 5 dilution and (iv) H. I. titre of 80 was taken as suspicious and only a titre of 160 or more as positive. On a comparison of the results of the H. I. tests and S. N. tests in 56 field cases of Newcastle disease, it was observed that the H. I. titre reached positive level sooner than the S. N. titre during the course of the disease. The specificity of H. I. test in the diagnosis of Newcastle disease was demons- trated on the basis of examination on 185 field cases. In the two series of controlled experiments, it was observed, that the H. I. titre in the infected birds rose to a positive level from two days before to three days after the first respiratory symptoms were noticed and in every case the H. I. titre became positive earlier than the S. N. titre, the variation being from one to four days, in concurrence with the results obtained from field cases. H. I. and S. N. titres of birds infected naturally or artificially were found to remain at positive levels over long periods, 5 to 23 months. The author concludes from the observation made on a series of 5000 H. I. tests that this test was accurate, rapid, easily performed and cheaper and superier to S. N. test (P.R.N.). The Influence of Casein upon Roughage Digestion in Cattle with Rumen Bacteriological Studies. BURROUGH, W., GALL, L. S., GERLAUGH, P. AND BETHKI, R. M., (1950). J. Anim. Sci. 9, 214 LOW protein cattle ration containing roughage and corn starch supplemented by varying additions of casein was fed to experimental steers. The protein content of the rations was 3.4, 4.6, 11.1 and 17.4 per cent. It was found that the additions of casein to this low protein ration resulted in increased dry matter digestibility of the roughage part of the ration. 205
206 ABSTRACTS Rumen samples obtained at the end of each digestion period were examined for counts of the rumen bacterial populations, gram stain morphology observations and cultural work pertaining to the physiology of the rumen bacteria present. These studies with and without the casein additions revealed differences which correlated closely with the degree of roughage digestion. The results offer further evidence of the need for a minimum protein requirement for efficient roughage digestion in cattle, especially when starch or starchy grains make up a part of the ration. This minimum protein requirement is interpreted as presenting a protein (nitrogen) requirement for the growth of rumen micro-organisms directly involved in roughage digestion. (B.D.) Salmonella Organisms on and in Chicken Eggs. CANTOR, A. and MCFARLANE VERNON. H. (1948). Poult. Sci. 27, 350-355 CULTURES from shell scrapings after mixing with normal saline were made on bismuth sulfite (Difco) agar plates and in tetrathionate brilliant green broth while the egg meats after proper sterilization of the shell were directly dropped into jars containing 50 c.c. of double strength Selenite-F enrichment broth or in tetrathionate broth with or without brilliant green and later on streaked on bismuth sulfite or MacConkey plates. In all, cultures were made from over two thousand eggs and the findings revealed that 0.6 per cent of the samples of shell scrapings and 1.2 per cent of the samples of the egg meats were positive for Salmonella organisms, while in no case the bacteria was isolated from the shell as well as the egg meat of the same egg. The strains have been typed as S. pullorum from the egg meats and S. montevideo and S. anatum from the shell scrapings. The Salmonella organisms were more common in lower grades of eggs than in any of the four higher quality grades. This is attributed to the presence of the organisms in the intestinal contents and droppings and in turn to soiled eggs. Apparently cleaning of low grade dirty eggs in the farm may increase the chances of the infection inside the contents before reaching the consumer, necessitating pasteu- rization prior to processing, in order to prevent contamination of the egg powder. The concurrent presence of Coliform and Salmonella organisms in samples of shell scrapings has also been studied. (B.M.T.)

Experiments with 'Antrycide' in the Sudan and East Africa. DAVEY, D. H. (1950). Trans. Roy. Soc. Trop. Med. and Hyg., 43, 583-616 THE author has done some extensive experimental observations on the effect of antrycide formulations against animal trypanosomiasis in Kenya. Uganda and the Sudan, and it is desirable that any worker interested in the subject should read the original article. Recent experiences in British East Africa reveal that 'Antrycide' have not achieved the anticipated measure of success. As regards the nature and duration of the prophylaxis, experimental results are so far inconclusive. It is suspected that the nature of prophylaxis may to a certain extent permit the development of a low grade infection in animals which, though not revealed by their routine blood smear examination, may serve as a source of danger to other susceptible animals. In Kenya and Uganda a number of cattle was suspected to have succumbed to a delayed toxic action of antrycide. The reason for this is not known and the occurrence of some extraneous factors are suspected. It is, however, admitted that antrycide is an outstanding agent for the treatment of most types of try- panosomiasis occurring in domestic animals, but, as a prophylactic, it still holds out promise of being a useful drug, and awaits further trials before its possible prophylactic value is ascertained. In view of the remarks made above, instead of abstracting the above article it is considered proper to give the conclusions in author's own words as follows : 1. The curative treatment for three strains of T. congolense tested in these experiments was a single subcutaneous dose of about 1 mg. per kg. antrycide methylsulphate, and for a fourth was about 2 mg. per kg. The two strains of T. vivax were not so completely tested, and all that can be said of them is that 1 mg. per kg. was not sufficient to cure all animals, but 5 mg. per kg. was. The latter dose has been suggested as the field dose because it errs on the generous side in the treatment of T. congolense and has cured those strains of T. vivax which have been tested. A personal communication from Mr. J. T. R. Evans has described how, in a big field trial in Sudan, approxi- mately 200,000 cattle were given this dose with almost entirely satisfactory results, disquiet only arising when calves were being treated. 2. On the basis of the evidence presented here, it is recommended that yearlings and older cattle should not be given more than 12 mg. per kg. antrycide methylsulphate, and treated animals should be kept as quiet as possible during treatment and for about 12 hours afterwards. It should be noted that these big doses (i.e. 12 mg. per kg. or more) have been given only to healthy cattle, and it is possible that cattle ill with trypanosomiasis or from some other cause may be less tolerant of the drug.
208 ABSTRACTS 3. The experimental results concerning the treatment of T. brucei in horses, donkeys and dogs are meagre, and the most that can be said is that 5 mg. per kg. methylsulphate has been used with apparently satis- factory results in the few cases tried. It is a point of importance that while all the treatments have been made as a single subcutaneous dose because this is clearly the treatment of choice for cattle, the necessity for single dose treatment is not so important in horses and dogs. 4. All the treatments reported here have been made subcutaneously, but a small number of cattle, and laboratory animals, have been treated intramuscularly. It appears that the doses recommended for sub- cutaneous injection may be safely given intramuscularly, should this route be preferred. 5. The properties of antrycide chloride are such that they lend themselves to the production of drug-fast strains. This salt should not therefore be used alone for curative purposes. 6. The prophylactic effect of the methylsulphate is inferior to the chloride but since it should be assumed that under general field conditions some at least, of the cattle being treated for prophylactic purposes may be infected with trypanosomes, a mixture of the two salts pro- viding both a curative and a prophylactic action should be used in prophylaxis. We must assume that break-through strains, at least of T. congolense have acquired some resistance to antrycide, and therefore they must be prevented as far as possible. In other words. if cattle are continuously exposed to infection, re-treatment must be made while the majority of animals are still protected from a previous treatment. The earliest times after treatment at which trypanosomes have been observed in animals kept in a tsetse area are therefore important. In the group of cattle at Kiboko which were treated with gramme 1.5 methylsulphate AND gramme 1 chloride T. vivax was first found in blood smears about 13 weeks after treatment and T. congolense 21 weeks after treatment ; in the group treated with gramme 1.5 methylsulphate AND gramme 2 chloride either T. vivax or T. brucei was found 13 weeks after treatment, T. vivax was definitely found 19 weeks after treat- ment and T. congolense 20 weeks after treatment. From what was said in the discussion of the prophylactic experiments, we may presume that break-through trypanosomes are found in blood smears about a month after infection. Consequently, to be fairly assured that re-treatment with either of these drug mixtures is made at a time when the great majority of animals are still completely free of trypanosomes, it must be made not later than about 8 weeks after the previous treatment. Probably if re-treatment is to be made at so short a time as this then gramme 1.5 methylsulphate mixed with gramme 0.5 chloride would be sufficient.
ABSTRACTS 209 An alternative is to suppose that T. vivax may be treated differently from T. congolense. In the first place we have good evidence that the break-through strains from cattle which were repeatedly bitten by G. pallidipes carrying T. vivax (Enali strain) were not obviously resistant to further treatment with antrycide. Secondly, we know that many stains of T. vivax pursue an almost benign course and that even a virulent T. vivax may be very much reduced in virulence if the course of the infection is checked or impeded in any way. If T. vivax may be regarded differently from T. congolense the period between treatments may be increased to about 12 weeks. The best treatment to employ in these circumstances is gramme 1.5 methylsulphate mixed with gramme 2 chloride because possibly only one of 11 animals at Kiboko which received this dose was infected at the time a second treatment would be given. 7. This consideration of a field dose for prophylactic use has been centred, for the most, around the experiment at Kiboko because our aim is to maintain cattle in a tsetse area, and Kiboko may be considered truly representative of a tsetse area, but the general conclusions that have been drawn concerning the periods of protection to be expected from the various treatments are borne out by the prophylactic ex- periments in cattle that were done under laboratory conditions.

REVIEWS COMMERCIAL METHODS OF TESTING MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS BY J. LYONS AND M. J. O'SHEA (Published by Cork University Press, University College, Cork, 1950, p.viii-218, 15 s) THE book deals with important methods of analysis of milk and other common milk products. It has been written primarily as a guide to those engaged in day to day examination of milk, and not as a treatise on the subject. The authors have achieved their object admirably. Going through the book one is impressed with the trouble taken in explaining each step in detail with illustrations where necessary. Though quite a large number of books are available on the subject, it is not often that one comes across a book written with such painstaking care where the authors have given the fullest benefit of their long teaching and practical experience. The book is divided into eleven chapters. In the beginning a general picture of the composition and important constituents of milk is given. An interesting chapter deal with the history of the evolution of the present methods of testing butter fat, now almost a forgotten subject. This is followed by a detailed description of the Gerber method as applied under routine practice. Again, a chapter deals with other standard methods of testing fat in milk. Further points covered in the book are details of methods of sampling, and important tests for the analysis of separated milk, cream, butter, cheese, concentrated milk products, ice-cream, etc. Two chapters illustrate important routine calculations generally come across in milk testing laboratories and creameries relating to butter fat test for milk and in the manufacture of butter. Methods for the detection of adulterants and evaluation of sanitary quality are also described. Miscellaneous tests like identification of preservatives, testing the strength of detergents, estimating hardness in water, etc., are discussed. Finally, an appendix is included giving useful conversion tables, composition and legal standards for milk and milk products, etc. This is followed by a detailed index. Throughout, the book is written in a clear and simple style. Before describing each method, the principles of the tests are explained so that it is possible to follow the details intelligently. The book should prove of considerable value to students, technicians and teachers. The printing and get-up of the book are commendable. (Z.R.K.) BEE-KEEPING CRAFT AND HOBBY BY CUMMING, A. R. AND MARGARET LOGAN (Published by Oliver and Boyd, London 10s. 6d.) THIS is a book of about 150 pages, written for the benefit of amateurs and professional bee-keepers, by authors who are well-qualified to write on the subject. The book sets forth, in a lucid form, all the essential known facts concerning 211
212 REVIEWS the principles and technique of bee-keeping, with particular reference to the climatic and other conditions prevailing in the British Isles. The book is singularly free from un-essential matter and matter of doubtful utility. A chapter of 10 pages is devoted to the production of heather honey, a honey variety highly prized by Consumers in Britain. The book, though primarily written for British bee-keepers, contains much sound advice, applicable to bee-keeping in all countries. Stress has rightly been laid on adequate feeding. 'At no time should there be less than ten pounds of stores in the hive, and feeding must be resorted to at once if at anytime the flow of nectar is insufficient to meet the growing needs of the growing stock' say the authors (page 61). This is advice which bee-keepers in India might well take to heart. The book is a welcome addition to the existing literature on the subject in the English language. (R.N.M.) A REPORT ON THE MARKETING OF MILK IN THE INDIAN UNION (Published by the Manager of Publications, Civil Lines, Delhi) THIS is one of the series of reports on the marketing of agricultural commodities issued by the Directorate of Marketing and Inspection of the Ministry of Agricul- ture, Government of India. The last report on milk was published in 1942, since then, although the capacity for production, the trend of utilization, and the organisation and economics of milk industry have hardly registered any deviation, there has been from August 1947 a change in the map of India, the overall effect of which has brought about, as in all other sectors, a change in the position of the dairy industry in India. It has, therefore, been very moot on the part of the Directorate of Marketing, to take stock of the situation as it stands to-day and to present an up- to-date picture of the subject. To start with, a survey has been made of the production capacity of milk in the constituent States and the Indian Union as a whole through several angles of consideration. On the basis of the census figures of 1945 and the demarcation of areas which followed in the wake of the political partition of the country a survey has been made of the breeding stock of cows, buffaloes and goats kept for milk production. Computation of milk yield from different species in different areas has been made in accordance 'with information and data available locally'. Certain recognized principles were supposed to have been used in arriving at the estimates, but knowing as we do, our limitations in resources for collecting the primary data the veracity of these estimates cannot be fully vouchsafed. The figures never- theless, as general observations indicate, give the picture in broad outlines in regard to milk supply in. the individual areas and in the Union as a whole. It has been shown that the average annual yield per cow is only 37.5 per cent of that per buffalo. As a result, although the total number of she buffaloes is 195.72 lakhs compared to 411.01 lakhs of cows, buffalo milk accounts for 54.4 per cent of the total supply of milk. The contribution from cows is 42.8 per cent and from goats 2.8 per cent only. The survey shows that during the last quinquennium, milk production has not kept pace with the increase in human population rather there are signs of Indian cattle deteriorating in milking capacity during recent years. The overall milk supply as recorded in the earlier report has not been influenced by the comparatively negligible export and import trade in dairy products.
REVIEWS 213 That the supply of milk is far too low for the demand, is reflected in the average daily per capita consumption of milk (including milk products calculated in terms of the fluid) of 5.45 oz. which is barely 1/8th to 1/10th of the quantity consumed in some of the progressive dairy countries of the world. The Indian average includes in one extreme no consumption, while in the other, as high as about 17 oz. This wide variability has been shown to be due to the availability of milk from tract to tract and the economic status of the individual consumer. The consumption of milk in India, as in all countries, is both in the fluid form as well as in the form of milk products. From nutritional standpoint, fluid consumption is obviously the most desirable way of using milk. In India, the fluid consumption to-day has been shown to be 36.2 per cent of the total production, which is an improvement on 28 per cent recorded in 1941. The utilization of major quantity of milk as products is mainly decided by the scattered production of milk in rural areas where facilities are lacking in the marketing of liquid milk. It is, therefore, but natural that the maximum volume of milk, 43.3 per cent of the total production, is disposed off as ghee which is least perishable amongst the Indian Dairy products, though least economical for the producer. Unlike in the previous report, the data given in the tabular statement entitled 'Utilization of milk in the Indian Union' (P. 53), no figure has been shown of milk converted into products other than those listed. This is rather an unfortunate omission, as it is well known that a measurable quantity of milk is converted into indigenous products, such as channa, rabri, malai, khur- chand, etc. There are two important byproducts, namely buttermilk and skim milk, obtainable from the dairy industry of the country. Approximately 2970 lakh maunds of buttermilk are annually produced, most of which is consumed by the producers, but a significant quantity is run to waste or not used to the maximum advantage. A large proportion of about 54 lakh maunds of skim milk, is converted into Industrial Casein. Since the fluid disposal of rural milk is largely undeveloped, and exigencies demand its conversion into relatively cheap but less perishable products, the economic return from the greater part of the total milk production is low. On the other hand the economic return is the highest for the quantity which enters the fluid market. Apart from the basic consideration of supply and demand, a number of factors have been found to influence the local price of fluid milk. In general, the demand being heavier than the supply, a number of malpractices are prevalent which encourage the adulteration of milk, and in the long run depress its price. Such tendencies have naturally stifled the incentive in the trade. With regard to the price of milk, the report has brought out a point of considerable interest. Before the advent of World War II the Indian price was the lowest compared to that in other dairy countries of the world. But, during recent years it has registered a phenomenal rise, so much so that the current price is almost two-fold of that in other countries. Another interesting point to note in this connection is that the consumer's price of milk is shared by the producer along with two other intermedies, namely the collector and the retailer, and his share of the price, on an average works out to be little over 60 per cent. The major portion of 900 lakh maunds (or 18.7 per cent of the entire production) of fluid milk which enters the market is for meeting the urban demand. About 60 to 70 per cent of the urban requirement is being produced within the municipa
214 REVIEWS limits, the rest comes from adjoining villages situated at a distance of 10 to 15 miles. The larger collection of village produced milk is best with many problems. The scattered production in the country-side, unhygenic conditions of production and handling, use of unclean and assorted vessels at different stages, the natural handicap to keep a perishable article like milk under tropical climates and the lack of suitable transport, are some of the important factors to be reckoned with. Besides, milk assembled for sale is not given any treatment to prolong the marketable life, except for a very small quantity which is processed mainly by boiling. It is, therefore, obvious why a larger portion of saleable milk is produced within the consuming zone, notwithstanding the high cost and the evils inherent to it. As with the col- lection and transport, the methods of distribution of milk are equally primitive, variable and ill-organised. The root cause of this state of affairs, as the Report has rigtly pointed out, is the fact that the milk trade is in the hands of 'petty dealers with limited means and narrow outlook.' Quality control is an integral part of the successful marketing of a commodity. In this context, market milk holds a place of special significance, because in its natural fresh condition, while it is a food par excellence, it is at the same time prone to contamination by pathogenic organisms, and it can easily be adulterated. Under the conditions prevalent in India, the importance of quality control of market milk can not be over-emphasized. Unfortunately, although various types of milk have been defined for legal purposes and their standards prescribed, there is as the Report points out, certain fundamental defects in the prescription given by the constituent States which now regulate the Food Adulteration Acts. Besides, the enforcement of the Acts is rather feeble owing largely to the 'demand' outstripping the 'supply' and the disorganised state of the trade. The Report, therefore, gives a very comprehensive discussion on how the quality control measures could be more rationally planned and in what way the Government in the Centre can coor- dinate the effort by introducing an uniformly applicable piece of legislation for all the Provinces and the States. In the last chapter, the Report gives extensive information in the recent develop- ments in the marketing of milk in urban areas and the efforts made by the Central Government to formulate policies and plans for the satisfactory solution of the urban milk problem. In this connection, attention has been specially drawn to the 'Five-year Plan' prepared by the Dairy Development Adviser to the Government of India for the guidance of the State Governments in dairy development work. The Report also describes the success achieved in recent years by some of the Pro- vincial Cooperative Departments in promoting production, collection and distribu- tion of village produced milk for urban supply through Cooperative Milk Societies and Unions. Although the Report does not contain the record of up-to-date achievement of that landmark in Indian dairying known as 'Bombay Milk Plan', it gives a fair outline of the genesis of the plan and the many facets of its conception. The Report is supported by a mass of statistical data (in the appendix) and a large number of maps, plates and diagrams. A useful summary is given at the end, as also certain conclusions and recommendations as a result of the compre- hensive survey. (K.C.S.)

ORIGINAL ARTICLES TESTS OF SOME PROPRIETORY INSECTICIDES By P. BALARAMA MENON, C. M. SEN GUPTA AND B. C. BASU, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, Uttar Pradesh (Received for publication on 16 October 1950) THE utility of testing proprietory insecticides and drugs by research institutions and government establishments has been a subject of much discussion and difference of opinion among the research workers. On the one hand it has been put forward that it is no use to the country to test products, the formulae or com- positions of which are not divulged by the manufacturers for trade reasons. On the other hand, it is pointed out that large sums of money could be saved for the country and much useful purpose gained by testing such products and correctly assessing the properties claimed for them in order that spurious claims may be exposed, useful products encouraged and industries of the country developed [Chopra and Basu, 1939]. It is now accepted on all hands that, in view of a large number of such drugs and insecticides of a proprietory nature being put into the market every day, it is necessary that they should be tested by the government or research institutes to assess their respective values for the benefit of the public. On this account the testing of products which are recieved for tests or otherwise put into the market, claiming therapeutic and insecticidal values. This paper reports the results of tests carried out in our laboratories on some of these products which were received by the Director, Indian Veterinary Research Institute from the manu- facturers. The proprietory preparations tested are given below: 1. Anofilum 2. Brizk 3. Gamatox Paste Dip 4. Kildem 5. Neocid-Geigy 6. No. 1050-Geigy 7. Pip 8. Pyrentol D 20 9. Pyro-colloid 10. Pyro-dust 1,500 Experimental methods A series of experiments were conducted in each case to test the insecticidal value of the above preparations on different species of arthropods. Various dilutions of each were tried the details of which are presented in tables. Separate controls 215
216 TESTS OF SOME PROPRIETORY INSECTICIDES [Vol. XXI, Part IV were kept for each series of experiment. The amount of spray used in the case of liquid preparations was on an average 0.015 c.c. per cubic foot. 1. Anofilum. This insecticide is marketed by the Indian Physiological Institute. The manufacturers claim that the product, when mixed with kerosene in the pro- portion of 16 ounces to one gallon, will make a most effective spray against all kinds of insects particularly mosquitoes, bugs, flies, etc. Anofilum was tested in dilutions of 10 per cent and 50 per cent in kerosene oil on wild caught adults of house flies (Musca Linn. mostly Musca nebulo Wied.) and 10 per cent on mosquitoes (Culex fatigans Wied.) the details of which are presented in Tables I and II below.

BASU 217 At the recommended dilution of 10 per cent, it had no immediate knock down effect and up to 45 minutes after spray no flies were killed but about 15 per cent were moribund. At the end of two hours after spray 50 per cent flies were dead and 20 per cent moribund. On the other hand a stronger dilution of 50 per cent Anofilum gave 20 per cent kill and 12 per cent moribund after 45 minutes and 65 per cent dead and 15 per cent moribund at the end of two hours. On mosquitoes a 10 per cent spray of Anofilum gave a kill of 5 per cent and 20 per cent moribund at the end of 45 minutes and 20 per cent kill and 25 per cent moribund at the end of two hours. It may be seen from the tables that Anofilum is a slow acting insecticide and the desired effect is obtained after a long period. 2. Brizk. Produced by the New International Trading Co., Bombay, it is claimed by the manufacturers to be the modern scientific insecticide containing 0.5 per cent Gamma BHC 'Gammexane' with pyrethrum. It is said to be effective against flies, mosquitoes, cockroaches, bugs and other insect pests. This product was tested against house flies, mosquitoes and poultry lice, the results of which are presented in Tables III, IV and V.

It was found to be an effective insecticide giving quick knock down, a high percentage of kill and some residual action. Brizk emulsified with water and soap up to four times its volume or diluted 1 in 4 in kerosine has also given good results when used against flies (Musca Linn. mostly M. nebulo Wied.) and mosquitoes (Culex fatigans Wied.). Brizk rids poultry of poultry lice (Menopon Linn. sp. and Goniocotes Nitzsch) when used as a fine spray. Fine atomisation was required in order that the particles of spray penetrated the feathers and came in contact with the lice. 3. Gamatox Paste Dip. Made by Cooper, McDougall and Robertson and issued by Wilkinson, Heywood and Clark, Bombay, the manufacturers claim that 'this dip is based on Benzene Hexachloride (Gammexane) and for all practical purposes may be regarded as non poisonous. Gamatox paste dip is effective for the control of a very wide range of external parasties on sheep, cattle and other domestic animals and afford an important degree of protection against reinfestation by parasites. It is an all round stock dip which can be placed safely in the hands of most inex- perienced stock owner. It is preferred to the arsenical and phenolic dips and is fully effective in all climates and stores well. In addition to its use in a bath, the wash can be employed at dipping strengths as a spray using any normal apparatus. This insecticide was tested in varying dilutions in the field on ticks and lice, on dog, buffalo, goat and poultry. Against the common brown dog tick, Rhipice- phalus sanguine us Latr. the dip gave very satisfactory results when used as a 1 in 20 dilution with water. Most of the ticks were found to have dropped down within 24 hours and reinfestation took place only after a week. When used in a dilution of 1 in 500 it took 72 hours for complete eradication and reinfestation took place within three days.

BASU 219 Against goat lice, Bovicola caprae (Gurlt) this insecticide gave complete kill within 24 hours when used in a dilution of 1 in 20 and 48 hours when used 1 in 500 dilution. The infested animals were sprayed with a Mish sprayer. On buffalo lice, Haematopinus tuberculatus Giebel, the insecticide gave satis- factory results when diluted 1 pound to 50 gallons of water and sprayed with a stirrup pump. Infestation was reduced by more than half but complete eradication was not obtained. When used in a dilution of 1 in 20 complete kill was obtained within 24 hours. On poultry lice, Goniocotes Nitzsch sp. and Menopon Linn sp., Gamatox paste dip used in a dilution of 1 in 10 and applied on the body with a cotton swab gave complete kill within 24 hours and reinfestation did not take place till after a fort- night. 4. Kildem. The manufacturers of this insecticide, the Standared Chemical and Pharmaceutical Co., Bombay, claim that it contains DDT with pyrethrum for killing mosquitoes, flies, fleas and other household pests. Tests with this insecticide on Musca Linn spp. (mostly M. nebulo Wied.) in the laboratory gave good results. A 10 per cent solution in kerosene gave almost complete knock down within 10 minutes and a majority kill in 1½ hours. Whereas in the case of Culex fatigans Wied., 50 per cent were knocked down within 10 minutes after spray and a majority kill within two hours. The results of these tests are presented in Tables VI and VII.

A DDT product manufactured by Messrs Geigy Insecticides Ltd., Bombay, is said to destroy bugs, lice, cockroaches, silver fishes, ants, etc., in dwellings and on human beings. It is claimed that Neocid containing 10 per cent DDT has residual and long lasting insecticidal properties and harmless to human beings and warm blooded animals. In our series of experiments the following results were obtained. Neocid dusted into the hairs of goats freed the animals of lice within 24 hours. Both biting and sucking lice (Bovicola caprae Gurlt and Linognathus Endl. spp.) are killed. The animals continued to be free of lice for more than a week. It is also effective against Haematopinus tuberculatus Giebel, the buffalo lice. Though the animals were freed of lice within 24 hours, reinfestation took place within five days presumably because the animals washed the dust off by wallowing. The powder should be well rubbed in between the hairs. By dusting the affected parts cattle were freed of Hyalomma aegyptium Linn. within 24 hours but not much of residual effect was observed as reinfestation took place within a week. 6. No. 1050-Geigy. (Suspension powder for use against cattle ticks.) Geigy No. 1050 is claimed by the manufacturers to be a 50 per cent DDT suspension powder to be made up into a spray with the help of water. The ratio recommended is 20 pounds of the powder to 100 gallons of water and the rate of application, one quart per animal. For use in dip baths, 30 pounds of Geigy No. 1050 to 100 gallons of water are indictaed. Such dips are claimed to have a residual effect for a con- siderable length of time. Five per cent spray of No. 1050 was found satisfactory in our experiments for the control of cattle ticks. The spray was applied by a Mish sprayer on the affected parts of the animal. The ticks treated belonged to the species Hyalomma aegyptium Linn. and Boophilus australis Fuller. Reinfestation did not take place for 15 days. 7. Pip. Pip, manufactured by the Bombay Chemicals Ltd., Bombay, is claimed to be a pyrethrum spray insecticide containing pyrethrum along with suitable activators and stabilising agents in an odourless mineral base oil. It is guaranteed to give a quick and cent per cent kill of all harmful insects like flies, mosquitoes, roaches, etc., and is said to be perfectly safe to human and all warm blooded animals. It is said to kill poultry lice and flies in the dairy. Tests on this insecticide in our laboratory indicated that pip had all the pro- perties of a good pyrethrum insecticide. On house flies (Musca Linn. spp. mostly Musca nebulo Wied.) and mosquitoes (Culex fatigans Wied.) it had a quick knock down effect and percentage of kill obtained was very high. On poultry lice (Menopon Linn. sp. and Goniocotes Nitzsch sp.) too, Pip was quite effective but much depends on the method adopted in applying the insecticide. Fine atomisation is required when used as a spray so as to ensure that the particles of the spray get inside between the feathers. The results of tests on these insects are presented in Tables VIII, IX and X.

BASU 227 SUMMARY Ten proprietory insecticides, viz., Anofilum, Brizk, Gamatox paste dip, Kildem, Neocid, No. 1050-Geigy, Pip, Pyrentol D 20, Pyro-colloid and Pyro-dust were tested in varying dilutions on different species of arthropods. Brizk, Kildem (10 per cent), Pip, Pyrentol D 20 (5 per cent) and pyro-colloid (1 in 600) were found quite effective against houseflies (Musca Linn. Spp. mostly Musca newbulo Wied.) and mosquitoes (Culex fatigans Wied.). Anofilum, though effective against the same species, had a delayed action. Brizk and Pip rid poultry of poultry lice (Menopon Linn sp. and Goniocotes Nitzsch). Pyro-colloid and Pyro-dust 1500 when tested against cattle tick (Hyalomma aegyptium Linn.) in the field gave about 50 per cent kill within 24 hours. Gamatox paste dip in different dilutions was found effective against the common brown dog tick (Rhiphicephalus sanguineus Latr.), goat lice (Bovicola caprae (Gurlt), buffalo lice (Haematopinus tuberculatus Giebel) and poultry lice (Menopon Linn sp. and Goniocotes Nitzsch) in field trials. It possesses both residual as well as high killing properties. Neocid dusted into the hairs of animals controlled goat lice (Bovicola caprae Gurlt and Linognathus Endl.), buffalo lice (Haematopinus tuberculatus Giebel) and cattle tick (Hyalomma aegyptium Linn.) within 24 hours. The residual effect varied from 5 to 8 days. No. 1050VALUE OF A MIXTURE OF DERRIS ROOT POWDER AND DDT IN THE CONTROL OF POULTRY LICE By P. BALARAMA MENON, C. M. SEN GUPTA AND B. C. BASU, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, Uttar Pradesh (Received for publication on 16 October, 1950) THE Animal Diseases and Pests Committee of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research in 1947 recommended that experiments on the use of a mixture of derris and DDT to control the external parasites of poultry should be conducted at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute. Accordingly, a series of experiments were conducted to test the efficacy of a mixture of derris and DDT along with a few other insecticides on poultry lice. This paper reports the results of these ex- periments. Poultry and poultry products are of immense value in the economy of the country specially when there is shortage of food materials. In the undivided India there were 1732 lakhs of fowls of which 522 lakhs were laying hens producing annually 33648 lakhs of eggs. It has been estimated that the total value of birds and eggs sold amount to Rs. 750 and 525 lakhs respectively. Lice in poultry are a serious problem to the poultry breeder. They are often present in sufficient numbers to cause great discomfort and even death. The irri- tation caused by them makes the bird exceedingly restless with consequent lower- ing of its condition and egg production. Uptil 1939 the standard treatment for controlling these insects was the use of sodium fluoride by dipping, dusting or the pinch method. With the advent of the new insecticides, much advancement has been made in the control of these pests, though the use of a few other chemicals as well as vegetable products has also been suggested. In brief, the record of previous work of importance in this connection may be summarized in the following paragraph. Bishopp and Wood [1917] appear to have first successfully controlled chicken lice with sodium fluoride. Earlier, Pearl et al. [1915] and Lamson [1917] used mercurial ointment but it was never popular and is not used nowadays. Abbott [1919] wrote on the use of naphthalene and allied products and found that mer- curial ointment, sodium fluoride, sulphur and pyrethrum were the most effective in controlling lice on poultry. Naphthalene is low in its toxicity to the pest and dangerous when applied to the chickens in excess of ten per cent. McIndoo et al. [1919] and Wells et al. [1922] found derris to be the safest and effective lousicide. Parman et al. [1928] administered many compounds orally but to no effect. Tel- ford [1944] found that a mixture of sodium fluoride (33 per cent) and DDT (4 per cent) was a very good lousicide.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The 58 birds used for this experiment were white leghorns each about 24 months old. The species of lice present on them belonged to the genera Menopon and Gonicotes. Birds showing less than 50 parasites each were discarded. They were divided into nine batches, 4 batches of eight birds each, three of six birds and two of four birds each. Amongst the first four batches of eight birds each, one batch was used for testing derris root powder, another for a mixture of derris and DDT and the remaining two batches for DDT in different strengths. Of the three batches of the second series, two were used for testing sodium fluoride in different strengths and one batch was kept as control. Of the two batches of four birds each one was used to test Gammexane and the other for pyrethrum dust. The details of these experiments are presented in Table II. The dilutions of the insecticides tested were as follows: 1. Derris (with 5 per cent rotenone content) ten per cent in talc. 2. D D T five per cent in talc. 3. D D T 2.5 per cent in talc. 4. A mixture of equal parts of 1 and 2. 5. Sodium fluoride 33 per cent in talc. 6. Sodium fluoride 20 per cent in talc. 7. Gammexane D 025 containing 0.6 per cent Gamma Isomer. 8. Powdered dried pyrethrum flowers. A salt shaker type applicator (old cuticura powder tins suitably modified) was used for dusting individual birds. The dust was rubbed in between the feathers by the hand. The amount of dust applied to each bird was determined by weighing the applicator both before and after use. Each batch of birds was kept in a seperate cage. Daily examination of the birds was conducted in each case to note the in- crease or decrease in lice population. After a week the experimental birds were released to mix with the control birds. Each experimental bird was examined every alternate day till reinfestation took place. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The results obtained in testing the various insecticides are tabulated in Table II. Good residual effect was exhibited by D D T (5 per cent and 2.5 per cent), Gammexane D 025 (0.6 per cent Gamma Isomer) Derris (10 per cent) and mixture of equal parts of derris (10 per cent) and D D T (5 per cent) and complete exter- mination was obtained in all these cases within 24 to 28 hours. Sodium fluoride (33 per cent) killed all lice within 60 hours but did not show any noticeable residual effect. Pyrethrum, while lacking in the residual properties of rotenone, DDT and Gammexane D 025, showed quick knock down action and complete kill was obtained within four hours.

Throughout the experiment the louse populations of the control birds were either stationary or found increasing. SUMMARY A series of experiments were conducted to determine the effectiveness of DDT derris powder, mixture of derris and DDT, Gammexane D 025, Pyrethrum and sodium fluoride on poultry lice. The insecticides were used in various propor- tions. Gammexane D 025, 5 per cent and 2.5 per cent DDT and a mixture containing equal parts of 10 per cent derris and 5 per cent DDT were found equally effective both in killing and residual effect. Ten per cent derris had similar killing properties but was found to have less residual effect. Pyrethrum gave quick knock down and complete kill within four hours but had no residual effect. Thirty three per cent sodium fluoride had practically no residual effect but gave complete kill within 60 hours. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The writers are grateful to Dr S.

INVESTIGATIONS ON TRACE ELEMENT COPPER I. THE DISTRIBUTION OF COPPER IN BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS By K. SAHAI and N. D. KEHAR, Animal Nutrition Section, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 1 June 1951) THERE are now no less than thirteen mineral elements known to be essential for animal life. These are Ca, P, Mg, Na, K, Cl, S, Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn, I and Co. Five of these, namely Cu, Mn, Zn, I and Co, have, in laboratory jargon, been dubbed 'trace' elements since they have been shown to function in quantities so minute that they may appropriately be described as traces. Copper as a metal has been used since very early times, the oldest specimens of cast copper dating back to 4000 B. C. The presence of this metal in biological materials, however, remained undetected until the beginning of the nineteenth century. Bucholz [1816] and Meissner [1817] were probably the first to establish definitely the presence of copper in plant life. The presence of copper in animal organism was for the first time detected by Sarzeau [1830]. Chevruel [1868], in a review on the copper content of biological material, suggested that the metal was widely distributed, but it was not until the observations of Bodansky [1921] and Mc Hargue [1925, 1926], however, that copper became recognized as other than an accidental constituent. Bertrand [1920] and Guerithault [1920] suggested that copper should be placed in the group of catalytic elements found in plants. Maquenne and Demoussy [1920] concluded that copper in some way aided the vital functions of the plant. Mc- Hargue [1927] suggested that copper together with other minor elements played an important role in life processes. The classical researches of Hart and coworkers [1928] suggested the role of copper in haematopoiesis. The specificity of copper as a supplement of iron in the regeneration of haemoglobin has since been demons- trated by Elvehjem and Hart [1929], Keil and Nelson [1931], Hamilton, Hunt and Carroll [1933], Meyers, Remp and Bing [1934], Potter, Elevehjem and Hart [1938], and Frost, Potter, Elvehjem and Hart [1940]. A specific effect on red cell produc- tion has been attributed to copper by Oda [1932], Schultze [1932], Stein and Lewis [1933], Binnet and Strumza [1934], Somogyi [1935] and others. The livestock malady which has been found to be associated with copper defi- ciency has been reported from widespread regions of the world. Sjollema [1933 described a disease of cattle in parts of Holland called 'Lecksucht', characterized by anorexia, emaciation, anaemia and diarrhoea, which responded to copper therapy In Florida a condition in cattle with similar symptoms and known as 'Saltsick' was reported by Becker et al. [1931] to respond to Fe and Cu therapy. Bennetts and Chapman [1937], found that a usually fatal condition of ataxia in new born 235 F
236 INVESTIGATIONS ON TRACE ELEMENT (COPPER) I. [Vol. XXI, Part IV lambs, enzootic in certain parts of western Australia, was associated with a defi- ciency of copper in the mother and could be avoided by treating the ewes with copper during the period of gestation. Confirmation of their discovery has been reported from South Australia by Bull et al. [1938] and from England by Dunlop and Wells [1938], where a similar malady known as 'swayback' occurs in certain restricted areas. An account of depigmentation, a new dietary deficiency disease, as cured by copper has been given by Gorter [1935] and Mc Collum et al. [1939]. Adequate amount of copper in the diet has been reported by Black et al. [1937] to show a more efficient utilization of food, greater weight gain, greater energy storage and greater accumulation of fat and protein. In larger doses copper is extremely toxic and heavy losses due to copper poisoning have been reported by Boughten and Hardy [1934] and Eden [1940]. The toxic level, however, has been reported by Eden [1940], and Pullar [1940] to vary with the type of diet as also with the species. The above observations clearly show that copper occupies a very important place in the group of 'trace' elements which are essential for animal life. In view of the fact that there is almost a complete lack of information on the significance of trace element, copper, in the nutrition of animals in India, where livestock play an important role in the agricultural economy, a systematic investi- gation on copper in relation to cattle nutrition was undertaken in these laboratories in 1944. The study of the nutritional role of an element necessitates primarily a know- ledge of its distribution in biological materials. The information on the copper content of biological materials is on the whole, meagre and whatever is available relates to foreign countries. It has been observed by Kehar and Momin [1950] that climate, soil and environmental conditions exercise a great influence on the chemical make up of feeds. The frequent data can, therefore, be of little value in providing accurate information. The present paper, therefore, which is the first of a series, has been devoted to the study of the copper content of cereal straws, grasses, leafy fodders, cultivated plants, grains, seeds and their by-products and also the different organs and blood of normal animals. The feeds for analysis were either obtained from the Institute Estate or a nursery of the Forest Department in Clutterbuckganj about four miles from this Institute. Some of the samples were procured from the market. The blood and tissues for analysis were collected from the normal animals. EXPERIMENTAL The method used for the estimation of copper is a slight modification of Eden and Green [1940] which is based on the diethylDecember, 1951] K. C. SAHAI AND N. D. KEHAR 237 is now cooled and 1 ml. perchloric acid and 2 ml. A. R. nitric acid are added and heating resumed. No undue frothning takes place and the dark brown colour gradu- ally lightens to faint greenish yellow or colourless. The tube is cooled and in order to ensure the removal of the last traces of organic matter, heating is again resumed after the addition of 0.5 ml. of perchloric acid and the same volume of nitric acid. After the digestion is complete, the flame is slightly raised and heating continued until thick white fumes of perchloric acid are no longer evolved. A little water is added to the tube while still warm, to keep in solution the salts separating out in the final stages of digestion. The liquid in the tube is now diluted to about 10 ml. and 5 ml. of each of a 5 per cent solution of sodium pyrophosphate and 10 per cent solution of sodium citrate are added and made alkaline with ammonia. The precipitate formed is rendered granular by heating the tubes in a water bath for 20 minutes. The tubes are next cooled and the contents diluted with water. A drop of 40 per cent solution of NaOH is added and is followed by 10 ml. of redistilled amyl alcohol and the volume made up with water to 50 ml. mark. Two ml. of 0.5 per cent sodium diethyl-dithio carbamate solution are now added and the tube is closed with a rubber stopper, and vigorously shaken for about a minute. The amyl alcohol takes up the yellow copper compound and is filtered through acid extracted filter paper. For colour comparison convenient matching ranges are made by taking in a 200 mm. x 25 mm. pyrex test tubs, 0.5 ml., 1 ml., 1.5 ml. and 2 ml. of a standard solution of copper sulphate containing 0.01 mgm. copper per ml. and adding the same quantities of water, pyrophosphate and citrate, making alkaline with ammonia, heating in a water bath, cooling, diluting, adding NaOH, etc., as after combustion to the unknowns; and the one nearest to the unknown was used. The accuracy of the modified method was determined by performing a number of recovery tests. The recovery worked out to be of almost the same order as with the original method. Greatest care was observed to prevent the introduction of any copper from outside. Even the reagents of the highest grade obtainable were not used until found to be copper free by actual test. The water used was redistilled from all- glass apparatus. All analyses were run in triplicate and to one of them was added a known quan- tity of copper for recovery. If a satisfactory recovery of the added copper was obtained it was felt that the copper content of the samples was being accurately determined.

Stereosparmuna snraviolens (padal) leaves with a copper content of 17.8 mg. per kg. stand out characteristically, possessing a value even higher than any of the concentrates. The samples forming the third group include oil cakes, grains and seeds and their by-products. The copper content in these feeds ranged from 9.2 mg. per kg. in Sesamum indicum (til cake) to 17.2 mg. per kg. in Cajanus indicus (arhar). The data presented above serves to throw light on the copper content of various Indian animal feeds and feeding stuffs. Since copper appears to serve as a link in the various physiological processes going on inside the animal body, the adequacy or otherwise of copper in a feed is likely to affect many a vital functions of the animal and is apt to be reflected in the copper content of various animal organs. A study of the copper status of a few more important animal organs was next undertaken. In Table II figures are given for the copper content of blood, liver, spleen. bone-marrow, lymph-gland and pancreas of six adult normal Kumaoni bullocks. The results have been calculated in mg. of copper per 100 ml. of blood or per kg. of dry tissue.

In descending order of copper content liver is followed by lymph-gland, bone-marrow pancreas and spleen. The concentration of copper in the liver per unit dry weight is 5 to 10 times the value recorded for the rest of the tissues. The observations regarding the high copper content of the liver are in conformity with those of Bodansky [1921], McHargue [1925] and Tompsett [1935]. The average concentration of copper in the liver of Kumaoni bullocks amounted to 173.6 mg. per kg. on dry basis, which is about six times the concentration of copper in adult human liver [Kleinmann and Klinke, 1930]. The copper content of bone-marrow of Kumaoni bullocks H
242 INVESTIGATIONS ON TRACE ELEMENT (COPPER) I. [Vol. XXI, Part IV ranged between 24.6 and 28.8 with an average of 26.6 mg. per kg. of the dry tissue. Data on the copper content of bone-marrow are few. Analytical limitations and the difficulty of obtaining satisfactory samples have been a serious handicap. The copper content of spleen, lymph-gland and pancreas on dry weight basis ranged from 15.6 to 19.2, 35.4 to 39.0 and 19.2 to 24.0 mg. with an average of 17.2, 37.1 and 22.0 mg. per kg. respectively. The copper content of the blood of Kumaoni bullocks ranged from 0.129 to 0.153 mg. per 100 ml. with an average of 0.141. The copper content of the blood of different species of normal animals has been studied by [Locke, Main and Rosbash, 1932, Roncato and Bassani 1934; Sarata, 1933, Tompsett, 1934].

SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE REGIONAL AND SEA- SONAL INCIDENCE OF BOVINE CONTAGIOUS PLEURO- PNEUMONIA IN ASSAM* By V. R. GOPALKRISHNAN, Veterinary Investigation Officer, Assam, Gauhati (Received for publication on 22 January 1951) THE existence of the classical contagious bovine pleuropneumonia in Assam as a specific epizootic and its tendency to spread in a slow and insidious manner were recorded in a previous article [Gopalkrishnan, 1943]. A systematic investigation of the occurrence of the disease has been carried out since the month of January 1940 when the writer had, for the first time, an opportunity to observe a natural outbreak of the disease in Goalpara district. Attempts were made to study the nature of the disease in the field in various parts of the Province and to collect all pertinent data. The present paper deals with some observations made on the regional distribution and seasonal incidence of the disease in Assam, for a period of nine years246 REGIONAL AND SEASONAL INCIDENCE OF BOVINE, ETC. [Vol. XXI, Part IV, Khutis are kept mostly by Nepalis and to a less extent by local people, in riverain tracts, forest areas and also in chars as there is ample facility for grazing and water supply. Herds of cattle and sometimes buffaloes graze about in areas around the khutis and are kept untethered in open enclosures. Milk and milk products are usually produced in khutis. Bulls and bullocks are also sold or exchanged. A khuti may contain a herd ranging from 25 to 500 animals. As mentioned earlier, systematic investigation was carried out from the beginning of January 1940 when an outbreak of the disease prevailed in Goalpara district. Materials obtained from this outbreak as well as from others later, were used for experimental work to confirm the existence of the disease in the Assam valley. As outbreaks occurred subsequently, available data were collected to study the epidemiology of the disease. Data obtained from outbreaks in various localities of the Province during a perod of nine years are given in Tables I and II.

Sibsagar district records the maximum number of outbreaks. Generally the disease is noticed in one locality or khuti and after some months it spreads to other neighbouring khutis. In several cases where such spread of the disease was observed, the unrestricted cattle movement was found to be the cause of the spread. Cattle movement is common for sale in cattle markets or in villages and for exchange of animals between khutis. It has also been noted that cattle were sold off, even at a cheaper rate, when the owner observed the onset of disease in his khuti. Another factor that contri- butes to the spread of infection in neighbouring localities is the common grazing ground. Village herds usually come in contact with infected animals during grazing and the disease spreads. Out of 43 outbreaks that occurred in the province during the period of nine years, 40 were recorded in the Assam valley and the remaining 3 outside it; one in Naga hills and two in Sylhet district (now in Pakistan). These three outbreaks were found to be due to cattle movement or transportation from plains to the hills during war emergency and immediately after. There was, however, no evidence of spread of the disease elsewhere from these localities after effective control measures were taken. Outbreaks were recorded in the same locality or village twice; in Deosiri khutis in 1940 and 1947, in Chenga village in 1943 and 1945. It appears to be too early to suggest any possibility of cyclic incidence in a particular locality. Seasonal incidence.December, 1951] V. R.

It would appear evident that there is no particular season for its occurrence. The nature of incidence suggests that it is rather erratic or irregular. However, some of the outbreaks were observed about a week or two after heavy rains. It is likely that the chilling due to the rains reduces resistance of the animals so that carriers either break.down or transmit the disease to, in contact with healthy animals. In several places the outbreaks seem to be the reappearance of the disease in an already known infected area or the spread due to movement of cattle. So outbreaks occur generally with no relation to climate, provided there is sufficient reservoir of infection. DISCUSSION The occurrence of the disease was observed in all the nine years for which data had been collected. There is, however, some variation in the nature of incidence; for instance, there was only one outbreak in 1944 and as many as nine in 1943. It would seem that the disease has no periodicity or regularity in its incidence as shown by the figures collected so far. The reporting of the outbreaks of the disease, was not usually prompt; there was often much delay, even up to about four to five months. Such delay limits the possibility of taking timely control measures and allows the opportunity for further spread of infection. Although some localities are far in the interior, with bad communications where some delay in reporting is inevitable, there is neverthe- less certain improvement and promptness in recent years. It has generally been reported that in apparently recovered animals, the infec- tive agent remains for a long time in a virulent conditions in necrosed or encapsulated portions of the lung, thus forming sequestra. Such animals remain apparently healthy but sometimes become infectious after some months or even years. No K

[Vol. XXI, Part IV sequestrum formation could be observed on post-mortem examination of several cases of natural deaths in various outbreaks in Assam. However, it seems possible that some recovered animals in an outbreak may retain the infective agent and start further outbreaks or spread of infection at some later date. In regard to the incidence of the disease in Kamrup district, where vaccination trials were undertaken, no outbreak of the disease was reported for an observed period of five years. The locality chosen was a known enzootic area on the Southern bank of the Brahmaputra. Vaccination was carried out in February 1943 and periodical observations were made for five years. Subsequent to vaccination, no outbreak prevailed in this area, nor did any of the vaccinated animals contract the disease. SUMMARY The paper records some observations on the regional distribution and seasonal incidence of bovine contagious pleuro-pneumonia in Assam for a period of nine yearsFREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE OF DIFFERENT STRAINS OF FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE VIRUS IN INDIA* By C. SEETHARAMAN and N. S. DATT, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on 25 June, 1951) (With one text-figure) ALTHOUGH foot-and-mouth disease does not cause a heavy mortality among susceptible animals particularly in India, the economic importance of the disease in respect of cattle is so great [Seetharaman, 1950] that scientists have been striving for a long time to evolve a suitable vaccine. The recurrence of the disease in reco vered animals after relatively short intervals led various workers to conceive the probability of the existence of different antigenic types of the virus. Vallee and Carre [Hutyra and Marek, 1922] were the first to distinguish two types of foot-and-mouth disease virus. One was designated 'O' after the department of Oise where the strain was first examined and the other 'A' after Ardennes the place of origin. Waldmann and Trautwein later named these types as 'A' and 'B'. The results obtained by Vallee and Carre were also confirmed by various workers. Subsequently, Waldmann and Trautwein [Hutyra and Marek, 1928] discovered another type of foot-and-mouth disease virus which was designated 'C'. Thus, three different strains of the virus came to be recognised. With the discovery of the three immunologically different types of the virus, it became necessary for any campaign of vaccination against foot-and-mouth disease to determine the type or types of the virus responsible for spontaneous outbreaks of the disease in a locality. Further, the type determination helps in tracing the source of infection and the mode of its spread. Besides the three standard strains of foot- and-mouth disease virus, there exists in nature a number of other strains of viruses, the antigenic structure of which may show a partial tendency to conform to any one of the three standard types. These are called variants. For instance, a particular strain totally breaks immunity against 'O' and 'A' but against Waldmann 'C' there is a partial breakdown of the immunity, indicating that this particular strain possesses some antigenic relationship with 'C' strain and hence is referred to as variant of the standard type ' C ' or in short 'C' variant. The nature of these variants has been explained as due to the characters and the properties of the virus undergoing change during animal passage both in experimental and natural infections. Thus Manninger and Laszalo [1930] demonstrated experimentally that the different variants of the virus were not definite types with fixed properties but only modifica- tions with the immunological characters changed during animal passage. A parti- cular fixed type of the virus may exhibit such a change only in the first few outbreaks after which it may revert to its original fixed types, thereby indicating that the *Work done in the Foot-and-Mouth Disease Research Scheme financed by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. L 251
252 FREQUENCY OF STRAINS OF FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE [Vol. XXI, Part IV variant nature of the strain is only a temporary phase and thus cannot be classified as a fixed type. Again according to Daubney [Hutyra and Marek], we are coming to the stage regarding the virus of foot-and-mouth disease as an extremely liable virus liable to mutations or changes which may completely alter the antigenic pro- perties of any given strain. METHODS AND MATERIALS Under a Scheme financed by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, investigations were started in May 1943 to evolve a suitable vaccine for protecting the Indian cattle against foot-and-mouth disease. To find out first the type or types of the virus responsible for the spontaneous outbreaks of the disease in this country, arrangements were made with the State authorities to collect numbers of field strains of the virus. Tubes containing glycerine phosphate buffer pH 7.6 were distributed to the Veterinary Investigation Officers for collecting the virus in the form of unruptured vesicles or scrapings from the lesions of affected animals. The three standard strains obtained from the British foot-and-mouth Research Station, Pirbright, in 1943 have since been maintained in guinea-pigs. The purity of these strains was tested from time to time and they were found to have remained distinct from one another over 62, 69 and 61 passages respectively [Seetharaman, 1949]. Eversince Waldmann and Pape [1920] reported the successful transmission of the disease to guinea-pigs, work on type determination and even quantitative studies on foot-and-mouth disease virus [Henderson, 1949] has been conducted using guinea- pigs because of the ease, convenience and economy with which they can be liberally used. Since these animals do not contract the disease by cohabitation many strains of the virus can be handled in one place without any fear of their getting mixed up. Further, because of the wide prevalence of the disease in cattle, it is difficult to procure clean animals for typing work. It is generally accepted that the type determination carried out using guinea-pigs is as good as with cattle. In all the type determination experiments described in this note, guinea-pigs were used although sometimes it was found necessary to passage the virus received from the field in cattle before it could be successfully transmitted to guinea-pigs. A total of 210 specimens received from the field were examined out of which only 62 proved viable on receipt at Mukteswar. The materials on receipt were emulsified with phosphate buffer solution pH 7.6 and inoculated intradermally in the hind foot pads of guinea-pigs. After 24-96 hours depending upon the virulence of the virus the guinea.pigs developed blisters which also contained lymph. The foot pads were stripped, emulsified as above and inoculated in another set of guinea-pigs. By repeating this process four to six times the field strains were adapted to guinea-pigs. Subsequently, guinea-pigs (immunised against unknown field strains) were tested against Vallee 'A' and 'O' and Wald- mann 'C' strains of the virus. By means of the immunological reactions produced in the guinea-pigs the types of the field strains were determined. OBSERVATIONS During type determination it was observed that besides the occurrence of the typical 'O', 'A' and 'C' strains, variants of these strains also occurred. There was
December, 1951] C. SEETHARAMAN AND N. S. DATT 253 also an atypical strain which was isolated from natural outbreak of the disease in Rawalpindi [Abdussalam, 1945]. On typing, this strains broke immunity against all the three strandard types, each of which again broke immunity against it. RESULTS The results of type determinations (Table I) showed that 37 strains belonged to Vallee 'O' or 'O' variant, 17 to Vallee 'A' or 'A' variant, 7 to Waldmann 'C' or 'C' variant and one remained atypical.

A reference to the literature indicates that Vallee 'O' M
254 FREQUENCY OF STRAINS OF FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE [Vol. XXI, Part IV, [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 1. predominates, next in turn is 'A' and lastly 'C'. The observations made in India are in agreement with those recorded elsewhere in the world. In the preparation of polyvalent vaccine, the occurrence of the atypical strain could however be ignored because of its rarity. The atypical strain of the virus isolated is perhaps a variant having some of the characters of any one of the O, A or C, which has been brought about by animal passage during the course of a natural outbreak. There are references in literature to the occurrence of such atypical strains. Manninger [1931] reported that during the period 1927-30, 28 strains were tested in Great Britain of which 27 belonged to 'O' type and one which did not appear to be either 'O' or 'A' or 'C' type. Andrews [1931] described 23 strains isolated in Great Britain from natural outbreaks
December, 1951] C. SEETHARAMAN AND N. S. DATT 255 of which 21 belonged to ' O ' type, the other two not falling under any of the three standard types. These strains were not intermediate but were distinct from one another. It has been observed under experimental conditions that an animal recovered from an infection of ' O ' and ' A ' is rendered resistant to some extent to an infection with ' C '. This is because Vallee 'O' and 'A' occur more frequently in nature, the animals perhaps develop resistance to Waldmann ' C ' and hence the frequency of occurrence of infection with 'C' is low as compared with ' O ' and ' A '. We are therefore in agreement with Fluckiger [1948] that vaccine containing the two strains ' O ' and 'A' should be quite adequate for combating foot-and-mouth disease. SUMMARY Analysis of the various types of foot-and-mouth disease virus encountered in India is given. Besides incidence of the standard strains 'O', 'A' and ' C ' and their variants, the occurrence of one atypical strain was observed. Vallee 'O' type has been found to be preponderant in India as elsewhere in the world. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors are greatly indebted to Mr. V. R.

COMPARISON OF FIRST AND SECOND EJACULATES COLLEC- TED IN RAPID SUCCESSION FROM THE INDIAN WATER -BUFFALO BOS BUBALIS By S. S. PRABHU and P. BHATTACHARYA, Animal Genetics Section, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 20th May 1951) INFORMATION on the relative quality of semen samples collected in succession on a given day, or at an interval of days, is of value in intensive utilisation of bulls at artificial insemination centres. It also facilitates drawing up of routine schedules for semen collection from artificial insemination bulls. Considerable data on frequency of copulation and ejaculation and on the relative qualities of ejacu- lated semen collected in quick succession, or at intervals of days, are available in lite- rature for bulls (Kirillov and Morozov, 1937; Davis and Williams, 1939; Herman and Swanson, 1941; Trimberger and Davies, 1942; Anderson, 1941, 1942 a and b; Webster, 1932; Weatherby et al., 1942). No such investigation relating to the Indian water.buffalo Bos bubalis, however, has been reported so far. In view of the peculiar position occupied by the Indian water buffalo in the dairy industry* and the growing popularity of artificial insemination as a method of achieving rapid livestock impro- vement (Bhattacharya and Prabhu, 1950), it became necessary to collect this in- formation. Accordingly the present study was undertaken. MATERIAL AND METHOD Over 100 pairs of ejaculates collected in rapid succession at weekly intervals from 8 buffalo bulls Nos. 4, 21, 33, 17, 19, 20, 16, and 31 were analyzed for following semen characteristics: (i) Volume (ii) Initial motility (iii) Sperm concentration (iv) Percentage of abnormal spermatozoa (v) Total sperm in an ejaculate (vi) Initial pH (vii) Percentage of dead sperm (viii) Percentage of 'weakly motile' spermatozoa (ix) Percentage of 'progressively motile' spermatozoa (x) Percentage of 'total motile' spermatozoa (xi) Total number of motile sperms in an ejaculate. In addition, 'reaction time' was also recorded. The percentage of dead spermatozoa was determined by using the opal-blue differential staining technique developed by Lasley, Easley and MacKenzie [1942] with the pH of the buffer adjusted to 6.6. The percentage of 'weakly', 'progres- sively' and 'total motile' spermatozoa were found by the technique described by Lasley [1944]. *According to the 1945 livestock census about 1/3 of the total cows and buffaloes kept for breeding or milk production are buffaloes and they are responsible for the production of approximately half the estimated annual milk and milk products. 257 N

With the exception of bull No. 4, the average percentage of weakly motile spermatozoa was higher in the first than in the second ejaculate. The average over bulls for the first ejaculate was 14.66 per cent as compared to 11.61 per cent of the second; but since between the ejaculates and within-ejaculates variation was high, the difference between ejaculates was found to be not statistically significant. (ix) Percentage of progressively motile spermatozoa. With the exception of bulls Nos. 21 and 33, the average percentage of progressively motile spermatozoa in the second ejaculate was found to be higher than in the first. The average over bulls was 32.62 per cent for the first ejaculate and 41.07 per cent for the second ejaculate. The difference was found to be not statistically significant. (x) Percentage of total motile spermatozoa. In five bulls (Nos. 33, 17, 19, 16 and 31) the average percentage of total motile spermatozoa was higher in the second than in the first ejaculate in bulls, while in the remaining three bulls, it was the other way. The average over bulls was in favour of the second ejaculate by 5.40 per cent. The difference, however, was statistically not significant. (xi) Total number of motile spermatozoa in an ejaculate. In five out of the eight bulls (Nos. 33, 17, 19, 20 and 31), the total number of motile spermatozoa in the second ejaculate was higher than in the first. The average over bulls for the first ejaculate was 480.88 millions and 548.80 millions for the second ejaculate. The difference was not statistically significant. (xii) Reaction time. It was observed that the reaction times varied consider- ably from bull to bull and within a bull from day to day of collection and within a given day, for the two ejaculates. The average over bulls for the first ejaculate was 33.13 seconds and for the second ejaculate, 38.48 seconds. The difference, however, was not statistically signi- ficant. With the exception of percentage of weakly motile spermatozoa and initial pH, the overall differences between bulls in the various semen characteristic studied were found to be statistically highly significant. CONCLUSION The two major factors which materially affect bulls in producing uniformly good quality semen and thereby, their intensive use in artificial insemination are (i) volume and (ii) sperm concentration. In Bos taurus dairy bulls, Herman and Swanson [1941] observed that the second ejaculate had a larger volume and a higher concentration of spermatozoa. Similar results have also been reported by Anderson [1941, 1942 a, b] and Weatherby [1941]. Our results showed no significant difference either in volume or sperm concentration between the first and second ejaculates of
262 COMPARISON OF FIRST AND SECOND EJACULATES, ETC. [Vol. XXI, Part IV buffalo bulls collected in rapid succession at weekly intervals. The total number of spermatozoa in the ejaculate approached the 5 per cent level of significance and was in favour of the first ejaculate. At the same time, it was observed that the first ejaculate on an average contained significantly larger number of dead and abnormal spermatozoa than the second, which should on an average make the latter ejaculate a better sample for routine use. SUMMARY Comparison was made between the various semen characteristics and reaction time of over 100 pairs of ejaculates collected in rapid succession at weekly intervals from 8 buffalo bulls. With the exception of percentage of abnormal spermatozoa and percentage of dead spermatozoa, differences in no other attributes studied were statistically signi- ficant. The difference in total number of sperm in the two ejaculates approached five per cent level of significance. In case of initial motility, the interaction bulls X ejaculates was significant. With the exception of percentage of weakly motile spermatozoa and initial pH, variation due to bulls in the other semen characteristics was highly significant. On the basis of the results obtained, it has been suggested that possibly on an average the second ejaculate obtained at weekly interval may be a better sample for routine use.

(B.N.G.) Control and Prevention of Neurolymphomatosis (Fowl Paralysis). WILSON, J. E., (1950). B. Vet. J. 106, 196-200 IT is observed, that young birds are most susceptible for fowl paralysis during the first 4 weeks of their life, and therefore strict isolation by removing them from contaminated runs or where, this is not possible recourse to intensive system, is suggested as measure of prevention. All direct or indirect contact with adult birds during the critical period i.e. the first six to eight weeks after hatching should be avoided, because of the danger of their being carriers, inspite of apparently being healthy. An experiment on above lines showed 1.11 per cent mortality in stock reared on uncontaminated grounds as compared to 34.4 per cent mortality in chicks reared on contaminated one. In another experiment, where isolation was effected after eight weeks, age, there was no material reduction in disease incidence. The author finds that direct egg transmission of the virus is not so important a factor in causing serious losses, as the non-isolation during the first few weeks of life. Routine fumigation, soon after setting eggs, will eliminate the virus from egg shells contaminated through birds, droppings. Large scale production of high degree resistant males from State aided breeding stations for distribution to the poultry industry is suggested. (B.N.G.). Some Aspects of Immunity in Rinderpest.

It is mentioned that antigenicity of G. T. V. varies with the nature of the strain, the type of goat, the number of passages, the age and condition of vaccinated animal, the post.vaccination treatment and the climatic conditions prevailing at the time,
December, 1951] ABSTRACTS 265 The type of reaction has no relation to the degree of immunity. The field strains also vary in their virulence, which points out towards multiplicity of rinderpest virus strains and for the same reason the antigenic value of the G. T. V. produced in the State may vary. The period of immunity in hill cattle is mentioned as 10 years and 3 to 5 years in the Plain cattle. Degree and duration of immunity can be increased, by keeping the vaccinated animals away from the heating effects of the sun, i.e. by vaccinating them in winter; and by giving protein rich food to stimulate the antibody formation in the body. The author prefers the subcutaneous system of inoculation to scari- fication method, because of the severity of reaction obtained in the latter and because of its being more or less an intra-glandular injection, on account of the intimate connection between the skin and lymphatics. Immunity is likely to be stepped up and prolonged if animal is given a suitable sensitizing dose 6 days prior to immunising dose. (H.K.I.). Protein as an Indicator of Pasture Forage Digestibility. R. M. FORBES (1950). J. Anim Sci. 9, 231 IN the present article an attempt has been made to evolve method of calculating the dry matter digestibility of forage from the protein content and the predicted protein digestibility. Data from digestion trials with steers and sheep were used for the purpose of these calculations. The digestibilities calculated by the protein digestibility method were compared with similar data obtained by conventional and lignin ratio methods. It was observed that the protein digestibility method gave average results similar to those obtained by the other two methods, generally. However, the slope of the regression lines relating dry matter digestibility to lignin content of the forage was less when the protein digestibility method was used than when either of the other two methods was used. The difference in slopes is, however, statistically significant in case of lamb trials only. A consideration of the data in- dicates that although the calculation of dry matter digestibility from predicted protein digestibility fails to attain the expected accuracy in all cases, the method may be used with a satisfactory degree of accuracy in case of grazing steers.

The accuracy of the indirect tests e.g. chloride test, catalase test, whiteside test, bromothymol blue test and the total cell count, when judged on the basis of culture test was 50.6, 46.0, 49.4, 55.2 and 45.0 per cent respectively, each test showing a high percentage of false positives. When assessed upon histopathological examination of the udder it was 87, 92, 82, 43.6 and 100 per cent respectively. The accuracy of the culture test by a similar comparison with the histopathological examination was
266 ABSTRACTS [Vol. XXI, Part IV only 45 per cent thereby showing that the culture test did not reveal all cases of Mastitis and those cases in which the pathogenic organism was absent but inflamma- tion was present would be classified as false positive, thus reflecting erroneously upon the value of indirect tests. A total cell count of 100,000 per ml. generally regarded as the border line for normal milk was shown to be too high and a count above 21,000 per ml. was regarded positive for mastitis. The pathological changes caused by Str. agalactiae were found to be primarily subacute catarrhal, marked by highly productive changes in the interstitial tissue and sever leucocytic infiltration in the alveoli, while those caused by Str. dysgalactiae, Str. uberis and pathogenic staphylococci were much milder. In one case of Corynebacterium pyogenes infection the lesions were mainly severe, subacute and were characterised by the presence of a suppurative exudate. The fibrous tissue was formed, which persisted resulting in extensive fibrosis. (M.M.S.). Storage of Bull Spermatozoa at low Temperatures. AUDREY, U. S. and POLGE, C. (1950). Vet. Rec. 62, 115-116 THE paper deals with the effect of glycerol on the revival of bull and goat spermato- zoa from very low temperatures without considering the fertilising power. Sam- ples of diluted bull and goat semen having concentrations of 5, 10, 15 and 20 per cent glycerol showed full motility, both immediately after and 3 hours after dilution when kept at room temperature (+20º C.) or at +2ºC. Motility was higher after 24 hours at + 2ºC. than at +20ºC. Sample of semen diluted in egg.yolk citrate showed no better result at these temperatures. Samples cooled at the rate of 1ºC. per minute from 0ºC. to December, 1951] ABSTRACTS 267 the subject has dealt in detail with: (1) the course of Trypanosoma congolense infection in cattle; (2) the demons- tration of antibody as a proof of the existence of secondary trypano- somiasis; (3) blood changes occurring during the incubation period of acute T. vivax infection of cattle; (4) the cryptic infection resulting from subcurative therapy and (5) the cryptic infection following the prophylactic use of drugs. The author reported in an earlier study that T. congolense hitherto considered to be a blood parasite, has also been found to act as a tissue parasite in the adrenal cortex and in the anterior pituitory glands. Though such findings were not constant but it was suggested by him that the lesions in the endocrines might have been caused by the direct action of the flagellates in the tissues. In discussing the results obtained from his observations on the above lines he emphasized that the cryptic infection of cattle trypanosomiasis constituted a form of 'secondary trypanosomiasis'. This condition was consequent upon a natural 'primary' stage, and that it was disease entity which could produce morbid symptoms ultimately resulting in the death of the animal. The author suggests that it was probable that the cryptic parasites in the animal body were active and not lying dormant, and that there was some focus of infection, but, where it was located and in what way it produced pathologic condition yet re- mained to be discovered. The reasonable hypothesis that followed was that during the secondary stage of trypanosomiasis the antibody in the serum was powerful enough to prevent blood invasion unless of course the host was subjected to some adverse conditions. The author suggests that the small number of trypanosomes that may have appeared in the blood from time to time was perhaps, due to an overspill from some tissue focus rather than the active cause of symptoms of disease. It was also reasonable to suppose that if substances inimical to trypanosomes were present in the blood serum they would inhibit the primary blood invasion and resulted in the creation of a tissue focus which might or might not be accompanied by active symp- toms. This explained how the drug prophylaxis and unsuccessful drug therapy led to inhibit the primary stage of the disease but allowed the development of the secondary stage. The antibody could be demonstrated in the serum during both primary and secondary stage but disappeared when the parasites were eliminated. It has been emphasized that the demonstration of antibody was a sure test of the presence of cryptic infection. The author has rightly concluded that the problem of trypanosomiasis could only be solved by a thorough study of the pathology and immunity reactions of the host and the behaviour of the parasite in response to exposure to sera and drugs.

REVIEWS INDEX OF TREATMENT BY HAMILTON KIRK (Published by Bailliere Tindall and CoxVol. XXI, Part IV] REVIEWS 269 animal breeding have been dealt with in accurate yet simple style, and the book is extremely lucid reading. There are four sections. Section I gives the historical background of the present day animal breeding industry in three chapters, and traces back to the domestication of animals, early man and the origin and evolution of animals. Section II deals with the problems of multiplication in eight chapters. The various aspects including the roles of the male and female, the endocrine glands, the artificial insemination in fertility, and the physiology of reproduction and lacta- tion, are discussed. Section III is about the variations in different characters. In eight chapters it discusses the mechanism and modes of their inheritance. Inclusion of a chapter on the statistical analysis of variation makes the determination and explanation of its genetic basis complete. Section IV explains the artifices in the art of successful breeding of improved stock. Breeding systems have been classified on basis of relationship and the points in selection for various purposes and kinds of livestock are brought out. The seven chapters are rounded off with one on food for thought for those who aspire to contri- bute their mite in increasing the exploitation of the profit making machinery that man has made of animals. There is a list of references for each chapter, and also an appendix on inheritance studies in animals and a general index at the end. A list of the livestock record associations makes another useful appendix and provides a channel of contact with the livestock development in progress in the U.S.A. The book is profusely illustrated. Except for chapters 13, 14 and 15, one, however, misses the chapterwise questions and problems which form the life of teaching and learning in many excellent text books. Perhaps a list of top-notch herds of different breeds of livestock would have also been a useful inclusion. And then a chapter on profitable disposal of good animals to keep up the incentive for producing improved stock would have been very welcome. Doubtless, the book has been extremely useful and popular as it is, since, during the last decade or so, its 3rd edition has gone into ten impressions. No one interested in animal breeding science, be he a teacher, a student or a practical breeder, can afford to do without a copy of this book. (P.B.). MGIPC
