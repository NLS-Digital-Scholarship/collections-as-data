SOME SIDE-ISSUES OF THE INVESTIGATIONINVESTIGATIONS INTO THE JAIL DIETARIES OF THE UNITED PROVINCES. INTRODUCTION. THE investigations herein recorded have engaged the attention of the staff1 of the Physiological Department of the Medical College, Calcutta, during all the time that could be spared from official duties. The work began in July 1909, immediately after the conclusion of the investigations on Bengal Jail Dietaries, 2 and has lasted just a year. As in the case of the Bengal Jail Dietaries, the investigations have been carried out on the initiative, and at the expense, of the Sanitary Department of the Government of India. Owing to the fact that there were no laboratories suitable in the United Provinces the work had to be done in Calcutta. This entailed a considerable amount of travelling as may be judged from the fact that the jail nearest to Calcutta worked in was over 500 miles away, and the most distant over 800 miles from the laboratory. Historical. Under this heading in our account of the investigations on Bengal Jail. Dietaries we referred to certain important papers on the subject of the dietaries of Indian. Jails. In discussing these papers we pointed out the fallacy of assuming that the chemical analysis of food-stuffs afforded a direct measure of their nutritive value. The diet scales laid down for Indian prisons have been worked out from the chemical composition of the available food- stuffs, and for the United Provinces in particular the combinations have been so arranged in the several dietaries as to present a practically constant intake of nitrogen and carbon2 nitrogen is derived or whether presented in a form easily made use of; so long as the actual quantity present in a diet comes up to the standard it does not matter seemingly what the source may be. The present inquiry aims at estimations of the percentage absorption of nitrogen shown by the different food-materials and the framing of diet scales based on the knowledge thus obtained, i.e., on their actual nutritive value and not on the gross chemical composition of the food-stuffs available. We further pointed out that the standards of the diet scales of Indian prisons appear to have been adapted from the dietaries of English Local Prisons, adjusting the quantities of their proximate principles for the difference in weight between English prisoners and Indian prisoners. This method we have shown to be fallacious with regard to the food-stuffs in use in Bengal Jails, and in the present publication, we shall bring forward plenty of evidence to disprove its correctness when applied to the food-stuffs of the United Provinces. We stated that, if the proximate principles of the materials enter- ing into the composition of Indian diets were absorbed in the same proportion as is the case in European diets, this method of framing diets and of calculating their nutritive value would be permissible. But the absorbability of the ultimate alimentary principles of Indian food-stuffs is very far from being identical with that of European food-stuffs, so that, while the gross intake may be identical in the two types of diet, the amount of protein absorbed from each may be very dissimilar, In his Memorandum1 on the Dietaries of Labouring Prisoners in Indian Jails, Lewis traces the history of the different scales of dietaries for Indian prisons and gives their value in the different alimentary constituents, contrasting them at the same time with the adapted English Local Prisons scales. In 1877 an Indian Jail Conference, assembled at Calcutta, adopted the following resolution suggesting the introduction of a new scale of dietary for labouring prisoners: 3 Lewis states that a comparison of the scales of diet recommended by this Conference with those approved by the Committee of 1864, shows that the main difference consists in the adoption of the principle that the issue of animal food should be left to the discretion of the local jail authorities instead of making it a compulsory article of the labouring and under-trial dietary. In doing this it would seem the Conference was influenced by the satisfactory experience furnished by the jails of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh and also of the Central Provinces, of the dieting of all prisoners without the issue of any animal food whatever. The diet scales in force in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh4 Thus the chemical analyses of the several diet scales for labouring prisoners in force in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh jails on the average gave a daily value of :5 readily be digested and assimilated by the body. In a diet, composed entirely of vegetable substances, the quality of the cooking is of much more importance than it is in animal food dietaries, seeing that a large proportion of nutriment contained in cereals and pulses is enclosed in extremely resistant, indigestible envelopes, which, if not effectually disposed of by proper cooking, defeat all attempts on the part of the digestive organs to profit by the food. In the endeavour which has been manifested by many framers of jail dietaries to raise the proportion of the nitrogenous element without necessitating a correspond- ing increase in the carbonaceous, a large addition to the pulses has been a favourite mode of meeting the requirements of a view which presupposed the rapid waste of muscle during exercise; but it is questionable whether so large an amount of nitrogenous material does not in reality deteriorate the value of the diet on account of the increased work thrown on the excretory organs in getting rid of a portion of the nitrogenous elements which the system does not require and which, to a certain extent, acts more as an irritant than as a food. In some cases, however, the excess of nitrogenous elements is given in the form of parched, or otherwise imperfectly cooked grain, so that it is probable that a large proportion of the contained nutriment will not be assimi- lated. On several grounds, therefore, the addition of undue proportion of pulses,6 In the experimental work carried out with different food-materials in order to ascertain the percentages of the nitrogen of those food-stuffs undergoing absorption, numerous examples of the same condition will be met with, and ample evidence will be afforded that the amount of nitrogen offered in a diet is no criterion of the level of nitrogenous metabolism attained on that diet. For this reason alone it is quite impossible to frame diets, composed of Indian food-stuffs, whose chemical composition is similar to those in use in Europe and expect that a similar degree of absorption will take place. It is, therefore, evident that any adaptations from the English prisons scales, as, suggested by Lewis, or from the prison dietaries of Scotland, as suggested by Macnamara,1 are wrong in principle as they make no allowance for the great difference in the absorbability of the nitrogen of European and of Indian food- stuffs. Further, much of the criticism aimed at the Indian jail dietaries, with a view of showing how excessive they are for prisoners of an average weight of 110 lbs., falls to the ground, as it is mainly based on the fallacy that an equally good absorption will be obtained with Indian as with European food- materials. That absorption from the two classes of food-stuffs is very different and very much to the disadvantage of the Indian, may account for the fact that no action has been taken to reduce the quantities of the food-materials entering into the composition of the Indian dietaries despite several strong recommendations to that effect. Experience had shown that, while the diets did appear most excessive, lesser quantities had not been satisfactory, or at least that the mortality rate has shown a gradual decrease as the prisoner has been better fed. The decrease in the death rate is probably much more intimately connected with the advances made in Sanitary Science than with the dietary changes during the last 50 years: however, the history of Indian Jail dietaries points to increases in the quantities of the food-materials as a rule to meet some exceptional out- break of sickness and increase of mortality. The Scope of the Present Enquiry. The present investigations deal with the7 (3) Determinations of the co-efficients of the absorption of the nitrogen of the food-materials in use. (4) Chemical examination of the excreta. (5) Determination of the average level of nitrogenous interchange per- mitted. by the jail dietaries. (6) The suitability of the diet scales at present in force with suggestions for their modification. (7) The evidence afforded by the physical development of the people on the effects of the level of nitrogenous interchange. The estimation of the nutritive value of the dietaries and the determina- tion of the co-efficient of the nitrogen absorption of the food-stuffs have again taken up the greater portion of the time that could be spared to the enquiry from official duties. Owing to the composition of the diets in the United Pro- vinces being more or less similar to vegetarian diets in Europe, and owing to the fact that they did not present the huge bulk of the Bengal diets, we had not the same difficulties to contend with as in the work in Bengal. We did not find the bulk interfering as in Bengal, and were therefore able to make use of the ordinary methods of procedure for the determinations of the percentages of nitrogen absorption from the food-stuffs entering into the composition of the dietaries. The investigations that have been made in Europe and America would appear to show that the food-materials in use in these countries have a high percentage of absorption for the several proximate principles. Thus Rubner and Atwater's1 figures give :8 likely to be included in European diets. The results of our investigations show percentages of protein absorption for these food-materials approximately similar to what has been obtained in Europe and America. The food-stuffs peculiar to the dietaries of the United Provinces, on the other hand, show very poor co-efficients of nitrogen absorption. It will be found that few of them exceed 60 per cent., most being between 50 and 60 per cent. What the ex- planation of this is we are unable to say, but, as suggested by Lewis, in all probability the method of cooking has a considerable influence on the absorp- tion of their nitrogenous constituent. The results of observations where the diet included considerable amounts of the pulses confirm the opinion expressed by Lewis as to the doubtful advan- tage of the addition of an undue proportion of pulses to make up dietaries to a given standard of protein intake. In connection with this work on metabolism there is nothing more strik- ing in observations on the urine and fæces of Europeans and natives of India, respectively, than the low percentage of nitrogen in the urine of the latter as compared with the former, and the small quantity of fæces in the case of the European, giving at most an average of 2 grms. of nitrogen per day compared with the large mass of fæces in the case of the native of India, giving quantities of nitrogen varying from 4 to 7 grms. per day. Later on we shall discuss the framing of suitable dietaries for the jails of the United Provinces, but it will readily be admitted that no diet could be accepted as anything approaching suitable that entailed such waste of precious material as that represented by 6 or 7 grms. of nitrogen daily in the fæces. The work carried out on the analyses of the excreta includes estimations of the absorption of carbohydrates which we shall discuss later in connection with suitability of the present diet scales. At present all we need say is that the dietaries in the jails of the United. Provinces do not present the excessive quantities of carbohydrates which form an outstanding feature of the Bengal Jail dietaries. Neither do we see such manifest signs of intestinal fermentation amongst the prisoners of the United Provinces as met with in the Bengali; so that the loss of potential energy Of the dietaries, through the conversion of carbohydrates into carbon dioxide, acetic acid, lactic acid, etc., within the intestinal canal, is probably much less than is the case with prisoners on diets of the Bengal type. No examination of the absorption of fat was carried out. The amount of fat entering into the composition of the jail dietaries of the United Provinces is very small, only a few grms. being added to that already contained in the food-materials. As fat forms so unimportant an element in the composition of the diets it was not considered necessary to lessen the time that could be
9 spared to other more important parts of the enquiry, by carrying out numerous investigations of a tedious nature on the fat in the fæces. We shall conclude what we have to say regarding the scope of the present enquiry by giving a short, concise Account of the work done. 1. All the different food-materials in use in the dietaries of the United Provinces have been analysed. The method adopted was to analyse the food- materials entering into the composition of the dietaries whose nutritive value was being examined. It will be found in the tables giving the results of these analyses that considerable differences were met with in the values of the proxi- mate principles of the same food-material in different jails, or even in the same jail with different samples of the same food-stuff. This is probably due to several different causes such as difference in moisture, degrees of cleanness, state of preservation of the seeds, locality of growth, etc., but the most important element in determining differences in chemical composition appeared to be the degree of contamination with foreign grains. It was practically impossible to get anything approaching pure samples of the different cereals, or even pulses in the different jails visited. A sample of wheat would be found to contain plenty of barley, usually different pulses and millets. Similarly, a sample of arhar dal might contain juar, bajra and other seeds. As the jail authorities make use of second quality of food-stuffs, the materials obtained in jails are never pure. Our analyses present the percentages of proximate principles as found in the jail samples and as actually used by the prisoners, and, except where otherwise stated, are analyses of second quality material or even of a quality more inferior still. This contamination, looked on from one point of view, may not be altogether an unmixed evil, as it may happen that the foreign grain or pulse may have the effect of raising the protein content and also to some extent the co-efficient of nitrogen absorption. Thus, for example, a pure sample of barley would show about 8 per cent. of protein and an absorp- tion of about 54 per cent., while a sample of barley contaminated with wheat may show up to 9.50 per cent. of protein and an absorption of 58 per cent. The draw-back is that wheat, being the most expensive of the food-stuffs in use,. contamination of wheat by any of the other materials means a dead loss to the State in cash and a lowering of the nutritive value of the diets to the prisoners, This part of the work required about 100 Kjeldahl's estimations off nitrogen 60 determinations of carbohydrate 50 determinations of fat. c
10 In all 35 different samples of food-stuffs, obtained from five different jails. in the United Provinces, were analysed. 2. Investigations were carried out in the following jails :11 The estimations of the nitrogen of the urine and fæces were usually done in duplicate, those connected with food analyses were usually in triplicate. (b) The total chlorides were estimated in all samples of urine analysed for total nitrogen, about 300 estimations. (c) Examinations of the fæces for carbohydrates were carried out with 80 samples12 corresponding with the food taken during the period of observation. An example will make this clear. Supposing an observation had been begun on the first of October by placing a batch of five prisoners on a known diet. They are kept on this diet during the 1st and 2nd of October ; on the morning of the 3rd of October each prisoner in the batch is given charcoal, and the same diet continued to the end of the observations. Now on the 4th of October a certain number of the prisoners will pass blackened stools, these will be collected and only these (except any passed after the blackening has disappeared). On the 5th October the remaining prisoners will pass blackened fæces and afterwards uncoloured fæces, all will be collected, mixed, weighed and samples taken. Shortly, at the beginning of the experiment we begin the collection of the fæces with the blackened stools, which correspond with the food taken on the 3rd of October. At the end of the experiment, say on the morning of the 10th October, we again give charcoal: now the process is reversed and the fæces are collected up to the time the blackening begins13 In the work on the nutritive value of the dietaries of the United Pro- vinces we have relied almost entirely on the accurate determination of the nitrogen intake and the output of nitrogen in the fæces14 CHAPTER I. The Food-Stuffs of the Jail Dietaries of the United Provinces. The dietaries in force since 1877, and probably earlier, are derived entirely from the vegetable kingdom. The food-materials consist of Wheat, Bajra, Juar, Barley, Makka, Marua, Rice, Gram and the pulses, vegetables and oil.

The wheat ata or flour of the dietaries is prepared from the whole grain by grinding with small hand-driven grinding stones, and it was quite noticeable in a sample of the ata how much of the outer envelopes of the wheat and conta- minating seeds23 700,000 tons. Juar is one of the most important rainy-season crops of India, forming with rice and wheat the chief staple foods of the country, especially in the United Provinces and Bengal. It is more palatable but less wholesome than maize.1 Makka or Maize (Zea Mays) is one of the earliest rain crops. It is grown almost after any winter crop and is usually followed by a winter crop in the same year. It occupies nearly 5 per cent. of the cropped area of the Prov- inces, yielding under one million tons. Marua or Mandua (Eleusine Coracana) is one of the small millets grown in the rains, with the object of replenishing the food-store at the earliest possi- ble moment; it matures about the end of August. Marua is the principal food-crop of large tracts in the Himalayas. Gram (Cicer Arietinum) is grown in the winter, either alone or mixed with barley. It frequently follows rice or an early autumn crop in the same year. It occupies about 13 per cent. of the cropped area of the Provinces, yielding about two and a quarter million tons. Rice (Oryza Sativa) is grown during the rains, mostly in low-lying heavy clays. The crop is grown year after year on the same land, but a winter pulse is frequently taken in the interval between two rice crops. Rice occu- pies 14 per cent. of the cropped area of the Provinces, yielding over three million tons. The creeping pulses mung (Phaseolus Mungo), urid, urd or mash (Phaseo- lus radiatus) are, as a rule, grown with juar and bajra. The winter pulses, besides gram, are peas, masur and kisari. Masur or lentil (Ervum Lens) is grown mainly in the damper parts of the Provinces, usually after autumn rice. The prices of food-grains vary considerably; the following may be taken as a fair average of the normal rates:24 The price will vary with the quality of the material supplied, but the above figures show the relative expense of wheat and barley, arhar and gram, and the gain to the supplier of a judicious admixture or these pairs or in other ways. However, as we have seen the different food-materials are often grown with one another and are thus mixed from the beginning. The ordinary vegetables in season are used in the jails. Each jail has a well-managed vegetable garden so that good vegetables are always to be had. We accepted the 6 ozs. of vegetables given in the jail dietaries and made no variation in this amount. The following tables give the percentage composition in proximate prin- ciples of the samples of food-materials received from the different jails. Special precautions were taken to get accurate results for the protein content, each sample being analysed three or more times. In Table F we have given the average composition of all the food-mate- rials obtained from the different jails where investigations were carried out, with their heat value in calories per ounce calculated from the percentage composi tion of the proximate principles, and also as determined experimentally from the food-stuffs. For the experimental determination of the heat value of the several food- materials we are again indebted to Professor Benedict of the Carnegie Institute, Washington, U.S.A., for which we tender him our sincere thanks.

We have given the tables, extracted from the United Provinces' Jail Code, showing the different diets sanctioned for prisoners. The dietaries are different for different classes of prisoners, but it will do all we require if we study the maximum diets laid down for adult labouring prisoners. These diets consist in a cereal pulse combination of 14 chittacks with 1 chittack of dal, 3 chit- tacks of vegetables, 4/25 of a chittack of oil, etc., the cereal pulse combina- tion to be made up according to a fixed scale. These diets are supposed to have been so arranged as to offer in each a practically identical amount of nitrogen and carbon, which indicates the principle on which the diets have been founded, viz., to arrange the several food-stuffs in such relative quantities that a certain standard of nitrogen and carbon intake shall be maintained. The Jail Code states that this standard should be 280 grains of nitrogen and 5268-7 grains of carbon. We shall have to discuss the suitability of these diets in the light of the experimental work carried out to ascertain the respective degrees of nitrogen absorption shown by the food-stuffs entering into them; at present we shall rest content with drawing attention to the fact that, in the framing of these scales, no attention was paid to the differences in absorbability of protein presented by the several food-materials. One food-stuff was looked upon as being as good as another so long as the respective quantities of each were so arranged that identical amounts of carbon and nitrogen were provided for in the dietaries. Thus it seems that the different food-materials appear to be able to replace each other if only the quantities be so arranged that the proper standard be main- tained. As would be expected this is by no means the case, the absorption of the most important element30 instead of attaching greater importance to the value of the food-stuffs as nutri- ments, that is, on the amount of absorption possible from them. It is the aim of the present investigation to appraise the different food-materials at their proper value, as indicated by the ease with which their most important consti- tuents are absorbed. We shall now take up the several dietaries in force from the standpoint of the gross quantities of the several constituents they offer. The dietaries are as follows:31 Diet B. Bajra. Pulse. Dal.

33 principles, the actual analyses of the diets do not give quantities so identical as supposed to be the case. Thus:34 are too high for the food-materials used in the jails of the United Provinces at the present time. Our calculated values of the different diets in proximate principles are based on the average composition of the food-materials analysed and as shown on table " F." We may, therefore, accept the figures representing their values as being fair averages of the diets as consumed by the prisoners. Any variation from these values will depend largely on the quality and pureness of the food-stuffs obtained for consumption. The apparent value of these diets. It will be evident to anyone conversant with the standards of dietaries that those of the jails of the United Provinces, offering over 100 grammes of protein and over 650 grammes of carbohydrates are by no means illiberal ; but that, on the contrary, for prisoners of an average weight of 110 to 115 lbs. the diets are in reality generous. To quote Lewis again, " The adapted English scales are, under every heading, considerably smaller than the average nutri- tive value of the North-Western Provinces' dietaries; the latter may, indeed, be said to be practically identical with the actual English scales. So that, if weight have influence on the food requirements of the body, it may be assumed that the labouring prisoners in these Provinces are, weight for weight, considerably better fed than labouring prisoners in England." He computes the average maximum diet to be sufficient for prisoners weighing 164 lbs. as compared with the average weight of prisoners in the United Provinces of 11035 CHAPTER III. The average amount of Nitrogen absorbed from the Jail Dietaries of the United Provinces. The diet scales for adult native prisoners on hard labour consist of 14 chittacks of a cereal pulse combination, 1 chittack of dal, 3 chittacks of vege- tables with salt, a little oil and chilli. The cereal pulse combination is invari- ably made up according to the subjoined table:36 outbreak of Beri-Beri in both of these caused it to be discontinued and its use has never been revived. Marua is never given at all; in fact, we failed to obtain samples even for analysis from the different jails, where investigations were carried out. Makka or Indian corn or maize is seldom, if ever, used; why this is so we do not understand as it is a very nutritious food-material and certainly superior to some of those in use. The pulses made use of in the United Provinces are principally arhar dal and urid dal. It would appear from the above table that gram dal is not classed as a pulse, but this is a mistake as gram dal belongs to the pulses. For at least nine months in the year Diet E., i.e.37 Province but is very much higher in the samples obtained from Agra and Lucknow than in those from Allahabad and Benares. As we shall show later the percentage of nitrogen of barley that undergoes absorption is very much lower than that of the nitrogen of a pure sample of wheat, it will be evident that any admixture of barley with wheat will have the effect of lowering the percentage of nitrogenous absorption of that sample. Thus, we found that the percentage absorption of the nitrogen of the wheat in use in Benares and Allahabad differed considerably from what was the case in Lucknow and Agra, and therefore the level of nitrogenous interchange on Diet E varied in these several jails. Similarly, as we shall have occasion to point out when dealing with diets into which barley enters, the fact that a pure sample of barley 38 (1) Benares Jail. SERIAL NUMBER 1. BATCH A.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS. 1. The food-stuffs of Allahabad and Benares districts are purer and show a higher degree of nitrogenous absorption than those of Agra, Lucknow or Mainpuri districts. 2. Of all the official diet scales and of several other combinations in- vestigated Diet E of the Jail Code proves itself superior, which explains the preference shown by all Jail Superintendents for this diet. It presents on an average throughout the province 17.09 grms. of nitrogen, or 106.81 grms. of protein, per man daily, and permits of an absorp- tion of 11.65 grms. nitrogen, or 72.81 grms. of protein. 3. Taking the whole year into consideration the dietaries of the jails of the United Provinces present an average daily intake of 16.73 grms. nitrogen, or 104.56 grms. protein per man, and are accompanied by an average daily absorption of 11.28 grms. nitrogen, or 69.50 grms. protein per man.

52 CHAPTER IV. The Determination of the Co-efficients of Absorption of the Nitro- gen offered in the Food-Stuffs entering into the Jail Dietaries of the United Provinces. In our work on Bengal Jail Dietaries 1 it was found to be impossible to obtain any constant figures that would represent the percentages of the nitro- gen absorbed from the different food-materials in use in Bengal Jails. The reason for this was ascribed to the very bulky condition of those diets when cooked. We ascertained that on a gradual increase of any one constituent, as for instance rice,53 tures are all classed as wheat. The fact that we obtained different results with seemingly the same diet in different jails gave us for a time a good deal of trouble and a certain amount of unnecessary repetition of experiments. The difficulty arises largely with wheat and barley, although the other food-stuffs are often mixed to a greater or lesser extent. Government, no doubt recognis- ing the difficulty of obtaining pure food-materials, only demands second class quality for jail consumption; the result of this is that, wheat being by far the most expensive of the different food-materials, the contractors supply wheat, unless carefully watched, that contains a very large proportion of barley, juar or even gram. We have seen samples of wheat sent in for jail consumption which were fully 50 per cent. barley and, as if that were not sufficient, in which both wheat and barley were weevil eaten, the grain being considerably damaged. Needless to say the absorption of nitrogen from diets containing that type of wheat is far below what should be the case. It is evident, therefore, in order to get anything like constant results we had to arrange that the same quality of the different food-stuffs should be given during a series of observations. When this was done the results worked out remarkably close. We shall now proceed to record the investigations carried out with a view of ascertaining the absorption co-efficients of the nitrogen offered in the food- stuffs entering into the jail dietaries of the United Provinces. Before doing so, however, for the sake of comparison we shall show what the absorption of nitro- gen should be from wheat that may be looked on as of first class quality. This wheat was specially procured for the purposes of the experiment and was a good deal superior to the ordinary sample of wheat in use in the jail. It showed on analyses considerably more protein than was present in any other sample of wheat analysed from jails in the United Provinces, viz., an average of 12 per cent. as compared with a little over 10 per cent. on an average of the wheat from different jails.

Juar 7 91 (5) The absorption of the nitrogen of gram dal92 The first class wheat shows 80.5 per cent. of its nitrogen absorbed, while the average ordinary jail wheat, in use in Lucknow and Benares only shows 69.2 per cent. absorbed. As has already been pointed out, there appears to be always an admixture of other cereals, and particularly barley, in even the best samples of wheat obtained. In the poorer samples of wheat all manner of grains are to be found, more especially barley, gram, maize, etc.: some of them will tend to raise the protein content of the sample while decreasing the relative absorption, while some will tend to lower the protein content and decrease the relative absorption at the same time. This being the case the percentage of protein shown by a sample may be no measure of the percentage of nitrogen absorbed from that sample. In the majority of fairly clean samples, however, the contamination is mainly due to barley, the greater portion of the other grains being got rid of during the cleaning process, so that the tendency is for a fall in protein content to be accompanied by a fall in the percentage of nitrogen absorbed. With regard to the higher figures obtained for the absorption of the nitrogen of barley and gram dal in Lucknow Jail and in Benares the chemical analyses throws some light. Thus: 93 of what good class food-stuffs should be and the nitrogen absorption they should show.

While this may be true for samples that are fairly clean and pure, or in which the only or chief foreign element is barley, it does not hold good for all classes of wheat, nor where the contaminating factors are of various kinds. Thus:109 GENERAL SUMMARY OF WORK ON NITROGEN ABSORPTION. We are now in a position to work out the averages of the absorption of the nitrogen shown by the different food-stuffs investigated in these large jails:110 This completes the investigations on the absorption of nitrogen of the different food-materials entering into the dietaries of the United Provinces. We have nothing further to add except again to point out that, wheat being the most important element in the dietaries, the level of nitrogenous interchange will mainly depend on the purity of the particular sample of wheat in use. With good quality of wheat the nitrogenous absorption from dietaries in which wheat forms the principal source of nitrogen is over 80 per cent., and thus compares very favourably with what has been observed in European vegetarian dietaries. When wheat is contaminated with other grains the absorption of nitrogen necessarily falls and the level of nitrogenous interchange is lowered. In connection with the values we found for the co-efficient of protein absorption for the food-materials in use in the jails of the United Provinces, the following results obtained from digestion experiments on the Japanese1 are of interest:111 The following figures for the digestibility of legumes obtained in America1 are also of interest:112 CHAPTER V. The Determination of the Co-efficients of Absorption of the Carbohy- drates offered in the Food-Stuffs entering into the Jail Dietaries of the United Provinces. So far in these researches we have dealt entirely with the absorption of protein, hardly mentioning the carbohydrates and fats. Protein is admittedly of pre-eminent importance in a diet; as it is from protein alone that the nitrogenous tissues of the body are built up and repaired, the protein of a diet cannot, therefore, be replaced by any other aliment. The dietaries of the jails of the United Provinces, being entirely derived from the vegetable kingdom, are not likely to be deficient in carbon if the nitrogenous principles are present in sufficient amount. Reference to our analyses of the several dietaries in force will show that the carbohydrates, offered the prisoners in the jails of the United Provinces, are well in excess of the quantities generally accepted as sufficient for Europeans of a much greater body-weight than attained by the average native of the United Provinces. So that, the carbohydrates per kilo of body-weight offered in the jail dietaries of the United Provinces are very much greater than are to be found in even Moleschott's or any of the standard dietaries framed for Europeans. We shall have something to say with regard to this peculiarity of these jail dietaries when discussing their suitability, at present our enquiry is directed to the absorption of carbohydrates possible from dietaries of this type. When discussing the carbohydrates of the Bengal jail dietaries,1 we point- ed out "that abundant experimental evidence had accumulated to show that the nutritive values of fat and carbohydrates are practically proportional to the amount of energy they furnish; consequently it was only important that the quantity of either or both be such that their total energy, when added to that of the protein of the diet, shall supply the amount required by the body. The maximum amount of energy that can be obtained by the body is not the total potential energy of the food consumed, since the potential energy of the corres- ponding fæces must be deducted. Furthermore, the body is not capable of completely oxidising the absorbed protein, the incompletely oxidised products being excreted in the urine, and the energy eliminated in this way must also be deducted. The net or actual energy-value of the food to the body is the total potential energy minus that of the corresponding urine and fæces.2" In dealing, however, with the vegetarian dietaries in force in Indian jails another factor has to be considered with regard to the energy or fuel value of a diet: this factor is the excessive fermentative processes taking place in the 1 Scientific Memoirs, No. 37. 2 The nutritive requirements of the body.

113 digestive tract, which constitutes an important source of loss of potential energy of the diets, through the conversion of sugar or starch into carbon dioxide, methane, hydrogen, acetic acid, lactic acid, butyric acid, etc., and other fermentative products of low caloric value. We brought forward evidence to show that this was, in all probability, a serious source of loss of the total potential energy of the Bengal diet and would account for the seem- ingly high percentage of carbohydrate absorption shown by Bengali prisoners. We did not carry out many observations on the absorption of carbohydrates from Bengal Jail dietaries, but those that were made pointed undoubtedly to a very trifling elimination of carbohydrates in the fæces. We have entered into this subject in more detail in our observations on the jail dietaries of the United Provinces, and have again found that the carbohydrates of the fæces form a very small proportion of the total carbohy- drates intake. Whether this means an actual high percentage of carbohydrate absorption, or only an apparently high percentage of absorption, from the break- ing up of starch and sugars by intestinal fermentation into products of little value, is an open question. In our opinion the inhabitant of the United Provinces does not exhibit signs and symptoms of gastro-intestinal fermenta- tion to anything like the same extent as met with in the Bengali. The fæces while often soft and voluminous are usually well-formed and seldom so light in colour as in the Bengali. Colic, diarrh114 I.115 Therefore, accepting the average value of Diet E in carbohydrate to be 614.68 grms., the average absorption is 592.74 grms., or 96.4 per cent. It will be evident from these results that the loss of sugar-forming substances in the fæces is very small compared with what was found to be the waste of protein materials. The absorption of protein exhibited by these same batches of prisoners on the same diets was 64.7 per cent. and 69.1 per cent. respectively. It would therefore appear that the carbohydrates of the diet are very much better absorbed than the protein; however, it has been already pointed out that while only a trifling amount of sugar-forming materials may be passed in the fæces, this is no proof that the absorption of carbohydrates is as high as it seems to be, as fermentation in the bowel may break up a considerable amount of the carbohydrates into bodies from which sugar cannot be obtained by hydrolysis. That is, carbohydrates may disappear in the bowel without either being absorbed as sugar or passed out in the fæces as sugar- forming material, while protein, on the other hand, is incapable of being so dissipated. Protein can neither be lost nor manufactured in the bowel by putrefaction of the intestinal contents; so that, we have in the estimation of the protein of the fæces a true measure of the loss of protein to the system, while the estimation of the carbohydrates of the fæces may not be any index of the extent of carbohydrate absorption. However, with this reservation as to the true interpretation of the results, we may say that apparently a very high percentage absorption 116 Total amount of fæces. Carbohydrates of fæces.

124 CHAPTER VI. The Suitability of the Jail Dietaries of the United Provinces. Having completed the work on the chemical examination of the food-ma- terials, and on the level of nitrogenous and carbohydrate interchange possible from the dietaries in force, we are now in a position to discuss the suitability of those diets and point out their weaknesses. At the same time we shall endea- vour to lay down the principles on which a satisfactory dietary should be founded, and the rational indications for the framing of suitable dietaries com- posed of the ordinary food-materials in use in the jails of the United Provinces. Physiologically a diet may be considered from two points of view, viz., its power or capability of forming new tissues or repairing waste125 (iii) Behari prisoners on Upper Bengal jail diets exist on a metabolism of 59.37 grms. protein daily. (iv) United Provinces prisoners exist on a metabolism of 70.53 grms. protein daily. There is no doubt, therefore, but that the jail dietaries of the United Pro- vinces are very much superior to those in use in Bengal, and seeing that the prisoners, both in Bengal and in the United Provinces, put on weight and im- prove physically while in jail, there can be no question of the actual sufficiency of the Bengal or United Provinces' prison fare. So far as experience goes the dietaries of the United Provinces have been in force for many years and the results have been satisfactory: in fact, in all work done so far on these diets the general opinion seems to be that the diets are excessive both in protein and carbohydrate. Leaving aside for the present the much discussed problem of the quantity of available protein a diet should furnish, we know from practical experience that the jail dietaries of the United Provinces are sufficient for all the physio- logical requirements of labouring prisoners; i.e., we know that dietaries furnish- ing 11.286 grms. of available nitrogen daily throughout the year are amply sufficient to maintain the prisoners in as good, and better, physical condition than they show either before incarceration or after release. We may, therefore, accept this level of nitrogenous interchange as a stan- dard to be maintained with any new scales, and search for such combinations of the several food-stuffs as will furnish this quantity and supply an adequate caloric value and will, at the same time, prevent the great loss of protein material that the present dietaries show. We have seen that on an average throughout the year only 67.4 per cent. of the total protein of the dietaries is absorbed and of any real service to the prisoners. It appears to us that this is the greatest drawback and most important weakness of the present diet scales, and that it is a rational indication to prevent as far as possible this loss to the State, while, at the same time, greatly reducing the quantity of nitrogenous matter left over for the intestinal tract to deal with. It cannot be for the welfare of the body that an average quantity of 34 grms. of protein daily should remain incapable of absorption, which, while in the bowel, provides a splendid culture medium for the growth of putrefactive micro-organisms. Any method of reducing this loss of protein will, therefore, be to the advantage of the State, in lessening the cost of the jail dietaries, and to the prisoners' advantage, in decreasing the risk of intesti- nal putrefaction with its attendant troubles, catarrh, diarrh126 of the protein content of the diet will be absorbed and made use of in the economy. We acknowledge at once that this means in reality to provide better diets than those at present in force, and that it shirks the important question as to whether an average level of nitrogenous metabolism of 11.286 grms. daily is not more than sufficient to meet the physiological needs of the body. Taking the average body-weight of the prisoner of the United Provinces at 54 to 56 kilos, it would mean the metabolism of 0.21 grm. of nitrogen per kilo of body-weight. Chittenden and his followers would consider anything over 0.12 grm. of nitrogen per kilo of body-weight as excessive, but we have brought forward evidence to show that this standard is probably insufficient.1 However, there is a great difference between 0.12 grm. and 0.21 grm. of nitrogenous interchange per kilo of body-weight, and we are fully persuaded that the latter amount is a good deal in excess of the level attained by the great majority of the inhabitants of United Provinces. Personally we are of the opinion that the metabolism of 0.21 grm. of nitrogen daily per kilo of body-weight is not excessive, and that it is greatly to the advantage of the prisoner in the maintenance of his physical. condition to have an adequate supply of absorbable protein. We believe, also it is to the advantage of the State that this level should not be lowered, as it ensures, in all probability, the physical fitness of the prisoners for the labour demanded and tends to lower the sickness and mortality rates. While this is our opinion, from a physiological point of view it must be admitted that the dietaries at present in force, or any framed in future to main- tain the same level, are distinctly superior to those available for the great mass of the population, and that this will tend to place a premium on crime in periods of scarcity. This, however, is a problem with which we have no concern; we simply point out its bearing in passing and leave the present policy of the maintenance of the superiority of jail dietaries, over those possible to the same classes outside the walls of the jails, to be determined by the government of the country. What we have got to deal with are the solid facts that the dietaries are at present superior inside the jail to those outside, that those dietaries permit an average level of 11.286 grms. of nitrogenous metabolism daily, and believing, as we do, that this level is not excessive, we have no physiological arguments to advance in support of any cutting down of the present scale of nitrogenous interchanges. Therefore, taking the dietaries, as a whole, from our first point of view, viz., their power or capability of forming new tissues or repairing waste, we are prepared to accept the present level of nitrogenous metabolism as a standard to 1 Scientific Memoirs: Nos. 34 and 37.
127 be maintained in the framing of new dietaries, or in any modifications of the present scales. Our reasons for so doing are:128 Taking the dietaries, as a whole, from our second point of view, viz., their power of yielding energy and heat, we are fully in agreement with the condemnation attached to diets in which the caloric value is so high. We know, of course, it is difficult to frame purely vegetarian diets which, while offering over 100 grms. of protein, will not show an excessive quantity of carbonaceous matter. Still no one could assert that a native of a hot climate, doing the very minimum of work, requires on an average over 60 calories per kilo of body-weight, while inhabitants of cold countries, like Europe and America, doing really hard work can live easily on from 40 to 45 calories per kilo of body-weight. It will be agreed, therefore, that there is room for reduction in the heat value of the dietaries. In discussing the question of how the excessive heat value of the diets of Bengal jails was dissipated, we were driven to the conclusion that neither as a source of body heat nor as a source for the energy of muscular contraction was it worked off. In all probability, as we have already intimated, a considerable amount is lost through the conversion of starch or sugar into bodies of low caloric value by intestinal fermentation. We have shown that so far as the carbohydrates are concerned the great proportion is broken up in the intestines, at least the quantity recoverable in the fæces is extremely small, being only from 2 to 4 per cent. of the total intake. We may, therefore, conclude with regard to the heat value of the jail dietaries of the United Provinces that they offer up to 50 per cent. more calories per kilo of body-weight than the standard dietaries framed for Euro- peans, that the amount of energy worked off in muscular contraction is very much less than in Europeans, and that the climate being tropical, the heat requisite for the maintenance of the body temperature should be considerably less than in Europeans. In what way exactly the high potential energy of the food is dissipated we are unable to state, but it is probably that, in addition to the sources of waste already mentioned, a greater proportion is lost by radiation owing to the meagre clothing worn as compared with Europeans. However, having taken every demand of the body for fuel into considera- tion, it must be admitted that the amount furnished in the jail dietaries is out of all proportion to that of the generally accepted standards. It therefore forms a weakness in the dietaries in force and will require correction, as far as possible, in any new scales suggested. II. THE INDIVIDUAL FOOD-MATERIALS OF THE JAIL DIETARIES OF THE UNITED PROVINCES DISCUSSED. Wheat is the most important of the cereals and reference to the observa- tions on the co-efficients of absorption of its protein and carbohydrate elements
129 will show that, given a good clean sample, it is far superior to any of the other cereals in use. We have found that first quality wheat will have over 80 per cent. of its protein and 97 per cent. of its carbohydrates absorbed: no other cereal in use shows anything like so good results. Juar shows 53 per cent. of its protein absorbed: barley 57.6 per cent., and bajra just under 50 per cent. absorption. Another point in its favour is the fact that the relationship existing between its nitrogen and carbon elements approaches in wheat much closer than in any of the other cereals to the ratio that should hold in a satisfactory diet. For this reason good first class wheat may be looked upon as a perfect food-stuff. It is somewhat deficient in fat, but that is not a matter of serious importance so far as natives of India are concerned. We have, therefore, in wheat of good quality an ideal food, superior in every respect to any of the other cereals of the jail dietaries of the United Provinces, and one that presents the minimum of waste of its protein element; so that diets composed largely of good wheat will leave the smallest residue of nitrogenous material to be dealt with by the intestinal tract, and offer the least opportunity for intestinal putrefaction and micro-organismal growth. Supposing for the moment that a diet composed wholly of first quality wheat exhibited the same degree of protein absorption as we have found, viz., 80.6 per cent., this would mean a great superiority over the absorption attained on the average for the dietaries at present in force, viz., 67.4 per cent. It would mean the reduction of the waste from over 33 per cent. to under 20 per cent.; such a reduction in the protein waste of the present diet scales would place them, physiologically, on a very different level from that which they now occupy. It would effectually correct the outstanding weakness of the present dietaries from the standpoint of the percentage of protein absorption, referred to when discussing the dietaries as a whole. Unfortunately, when we come to analyse the results of the work on the absorption of the protein of the different samples of wheat actually in use in several jails, we find that the protein absorption falls far short of the percentage absorption shown by the first quality of wheat experimented with in Benares Jail. On an average the wheat in use in different parts of the province exhibited a protein absorption of 67.1 per cent. While this absorp- tion is decidedly superior to what was obtained with any of the other cereals, juar, barley, or bajra, it is a serious falling off from the figure given for the protein absorption of first class material. We have already discussed at length the cause of this great difference in the protein absorption from first quality and the ordinary jail wheat, and have shown that it is practically a question of a pure versus a contaminated sample. It will be evident that, if it is impossible S
130 to get a better quality of wheat than the average of those we worked with, it is hopeless to make any attempt to raise the percentage level of protein absorption, and therefore useless to aim at a lessening of the large residue of nitrogenous matter left over from the present dietaries. The following consi- deration will make this clear: wheat being the cereal exhibiting the highest degree of protein absorption, it must form a large part of the diet: if wheat only shows 67.1 per cent. of its protein absorbed, then the protein absorption from the whole diet can never be much greater than 67.1 per cent., therefore, unless the percentage absorption of the protein of wheat can be raised, no variation in the amount of wheat in the diet can ever lessen the percentage of waste by the bowel. Fortunately for the prisoners it is possible to obtain a better class of wheat than is at present accepted for consumption; so that, we may hope to be able to decrease the large nitrogenous residue from the dietaries now in force to smaller proportions.1 It is well-known that there is often great admixture of other cereals with wheat when grown, but if first class wheat were demanded for jail purposes very good samples could be obtained. The present system of accepting an inferior quality of wheat for the feeding of prisoners, even though cleaned afterwards in the jails, allows too much of an opportunity for the contractor to supply material that is exceedingly dirty and mixed to an immense extent with cheaper and inferior cereals and other grains. Some of the samples we have analysed, taken from the jail stock, were very poor in quality and greatly contaminated with foreign materials. In order, therefore, to raise the percentage of protein absorption of the jail dietaries and lessen the intestinal nitrogenous residue, the first step must be to insist on wheat of the best quality being supplied to the jails for the feeding of the prisoners. We shall show later that this will be more economi- cal in the end than the present system. 1 In this connection we would draw attention to the very valuable report on Indian wheat by McDougall Brothers. This firm working with four representative Indian wheats, viz., Indian, fine soft white, " superior soft red, " average hard white, " " " red, pronounce them to be exceedingly useful wheats, in fact hardly equalled for what is deficient and wanting in the English markets by any other wheats. Their great dryness and soundness render them invaluable for admixture with English wheats. Added to their dryness, their thinness of skins and consequent greatness of the yield of flour must always place them in the front rank as a "miller's" wheat. " The Indian wheats now specially under review were delivered to us in excellent condition with freedom from dirt, barley, gram, and other impurities, also with a freedom from weevils, rarely equalled by Indian wheats." The yield of flour and bread from Indian wheats is unprecedented, ranging from 77.4 to 80.5 per cent., against English wheat 65.2 per cent. and American spring wheat 72.2 per cent.
131 With regard to the other cereals, juar, barley, bajra, which we investiga- ted, the protein absorption from them is so poor that they are quite unsuitable to be used alone as the chief cereal of dietaries, if the present standard of protein metabolism shown by the prisoners is to be maintained. These three alone are ever given in the jails of the United Provinces; the other cereals, makka, marua and rice, laid down in the Jail Code, never seem to be used at all. Diets such as B, F, G, and probably D as sanctioned for the jails of the United Provinces, in which the principal cereal is bajra, juar, barley and marua, res- pectively, exhibit so poor an absolute and relative protein absorption that they cannot be accepted as satisfactory diets. Thus:132 which shows 11.64996 grms. of nitrogen absorption, or 68.16 per cent. of the nitrogen value of the diet. Even though Diet E cannot be said to have given very good results, it is so much superior to anything presented by Diets B, F, or G, that it is not difficult to understand the action of Jail Superintendents in practically neglecting Diets B, F, and G, and making use almost entirely of Diet E, which experience has proved to be so much superior. We have no doubt but that the other neglected diets of the Jail Code, viz., Diets C, D, and H, on investigation would have shown equally poor results. It is evident, therefore, if the present standard of protein interchange is to be maintained, and if an effort is to be made to lessen the percentage of nitrogenous waste shown by the present dietaries, that juar, barley, bajra, and probably makka, marua and rice, as the principal cereals of the dietaries cannot be taken into consideration. In other words, it practically means the doing away with the dietaries as laid down in the Jail Code; Diets B, C, D, F, G, and H to disappear absolutely, and Diets A and E to be modified in a manner we shall presently make clear. The deletion of the above diet scales from the Jail Code is not really so serious a step as it would appear to be, practical experience has long ago shown them unsatisfactory and they are never used: so that, it will only be a matter of acknowledging and endorsing officially the teachings of experience. All we have done is to corroborate by practical investigations the empirical knowledge of the Jail Superintendents and to explain on a scientific basis their findings. Juar, barley, bajra, marua, makka and rice would therefore drop from being principals into the category of secondary food-stuffs, or could only be mixed with wheat in suitable proportions. To this, however, we shall return. With regard to the other food-materials entering into the jail dietaries of the United Provinces, viz., pulse, vegetables and oil, the only one we wish to discuss is pulse. The different pulses in use are, arhar dal, urid dal and gram dal. Our investigations on the protein absorption exhibited by these different dals make it abundantly clear that arhar is by far superior to the other two. Thus arhar dal shows well over 80 per cent. of its protein capable of absorption, while urid at its best only gives 69.2 per cent. and gram dal 64.2 per cent. Arhar dal seems to be the favourite form of pulse with the wheat-eating population: we found this to be true for both the inhabitants of the United Provinces and Behar. The rice-eating Bengali and Ooriya, on the other hand, seem to prefer the more highly nitrogenous forms, such as mung dal and massur dal. The explanation may be a demand by the
133 system for more protein with a rice diet, while with diets composed principally of wheat, which already contain sufficient assimilable protein, a less highly nitrogenous form of dal seems to be more agreeable. There can be little doubt but that the methods of cooking and prepara- tion of the dals for consumption has a great influence on the degree of protein absorption.1 Gram dal, for instance, is usually given as a morning meal in the form of parched gram, i.e., simply fried or heated until the greater part of the contained moisture is got rid of; no steps whatever are taken to break up the grains so that the digestive juices may have a proper opportunity of carrying out their work satisfactorily. Investigations 2 on the absorption of pea and lentil flour, properly cooked, show that the protein is all taken up except about 8 to 9 per cent. If, however, the pulse is not given in a state of fine division, the loss of protein has been found to rise to 40 per cent. The following table compiled by Hutchison 3 gives the relative absorption of the protein of various foods:134 of arhar dal already present in those dietaries; so that, those diets contain 3, 3½ and 4 chittacks of total pulses, quantities that are far too great to permit of a high degree of protein absorption. We found in our work on Bengal Jail Dietaries that it was useless to increase the pulses beyond 2½ chittacks or about 5 ounces, and the evidence afforded by the work in the United Provinces would tend to corroborate that finding. The large quantities of the pulses in the present jail dietaries of the United Provinces are due to the mistaken opinion that the nutritive value of the diets would be increased by augmenting the protein content, and the pulses providing an easy means of doing this, without unnecessarily increasing the carbonaceous material, the result has been to give dal in quantities in excess of the amount from which the maximal absorption will be obtained, and far in excess of the average amount consumed by the inhabitants of the Province in their own homes. Except in Diets A, G, and H pulses to the extent of at least 3 chittacks will be found; and, in the majority of those diets, up to 50 per cent. of the total protein offered will be seen to be derived from dals. We have condemned Diets B, C, D, and F for other reasons, but they might also be severely criticised for the excessive amount of pulse they contain. Diet E has been shown to be much superior to any of the other diets sanctioned for prisoners in the United Provinces. We found that, on an average over the different jails where observations were made, this diet permitted 68.16 per cent. of its protein to be absorbed, or 11.64996 grms. of nitrogen per man daily. On examining the composition of this diet it will be seen to contain 2½ chittacks of gram dal and 1 chittack of arhar, in all 3½ chittacks or over seven ounces of pulses. So that, even in this diet, the best one of the eight laid down, the quantity of pulses is at least one chittack or two ounces above the amount from which the best results may be expected. We fail to see any reason for the addition of over seven ounces of pulse to a diet largely consisting of wheat. Wheat, as we have seen, contains practically the proper relationship between its nitrogen and carbon, so that there can be no necessity for the addition of a large quantity of a highly nitrogenous material, if the quantity of wheat in the diet is already sufficient. Of course it has been added to bring the total protein value of the diet, on chemical analysis, up to what was considered the proper standard for labouring prisoners. The result is that 2½ chittacks of parched gram is given daily from which only 64.2 per cent. of the protein is absorbed, thus decreasing very considerably the percentage of protein absorption from the diet. If the gram dal were cut out of this diet altogether and an extra chittack of arhar dal substituted, we should obtain an absorption of protein quite up to the desired level and have a diet from which the percentage of nitrogenous waste was considerably lower.
135 We may, therefore, conclude this consideration of the pulses of these diet scales, by stating that they are present in quantities much in excess of what is required, and in far greater abundance than the people of the Province can afford, or wish to have. Two and a half chittacks or five ounces is the maximum amount of pulse that should enter into any diet, and, if gram is to be given it should be properly cooked, not made use of as parched gram, and it should never be the only pulse in the composition of the diet. The superiority of arhar dal and the fact that it is the favourite form of pulse with natives of the United Provinces should ensure that this pulse will be used in all diets to as great an extent as possible. Urid dal being more suitable than other forms in the preparation of bajra and juar for consumption, this dal should be used in diets into the composition of which those cereals enter. One chittack of urid dal will be found amply sufficient in the cooking of the quantities of juar or bajra recommended in new dietaries. SUMMARY OF THE DIFFERENT POINTS DISCUSSED WITH CON- CLUSIONS ARRIVED AT REGARDING THE FOOD-STUFFS AND DIETARIES OF THE JAILS OF THE UNITED PROVINCES. 1. Taking the dietaries as a whole we found that they afforded a meta- bolism of 11.286 grms. of nitrogen per man daily on the average throughout the year. For reasons advanced we do not consider this amount excessive, while we do consider it quite sufficient. The physiological weaknesses of these dietaries in general were:136 wheat we found to be an ideal food and one that exhibited the lowest percent- age of protein waste of all the cereals. Poor quality of wheat, while superior to juar, bajra or barley, gives too much nitrogenous residue for the bowel to deal with to be satisfactory. In order, therefore, to prevent excessive protein waste by the bowel good first class wheat should replace the quality at present accepted for jail consumption. If the best quality of wheat were used, a smaller quantity would give as good results, as regards the level of nitrogenous metabolism, as the present amount shows. Therefore, being able to decrease the quantity of wheat in the dietaries, by giving a better quality, we should tend to correct both the physio- logical weaknesses of the dietaries above mentioned. That it is possible to obtain better quality of wheat than accepted for jail consumption, we have shown by working with a first class wheat in Benares Jail.1 3. Regarding the other cereals, bajra, juar and barley, the absorption of protein from them is so poor that they are unsuitable to form alone the principal cereal of dietaries.2 This condemnation involves all the dietaries except Diets A and E of the Jail Code. However, as the condemned diets have been discontinued for years, our work had simply afforded an explanation of their neglect. The fact that Diet E is used practically entirely in the feeding of prisoners throughout the province can be explained by the superiority of its nutritive value. 4. Of the different forms of pulse used in the dietaries arhar dal is decidedly superior, showing 80 to 84 per cent. of its protein capable of absorp- tion, while gram dal only has 64.2 per cent. absorbed. Gram dal probably suffers considerably from the method of cooking in use, viz., parching. Urid dal shows 69 per cent. of protein absorption, but probably would give a higher figure if made use of in diets in which wheat, instead of juar or bajra, formed the principal cereal, and in which it was made use of in smaller quantities. 1 In connection with the quality of Indian wheat Church states137 We find that the quantities of pulse entering into the composition of the dietaries, even Diet E, are too high, and suggest that no diet should contain more than 2½ chittacks of pulses, of which as much as possible should be in the form of arhar dal. This concludes all we have got to say with regard to the suitability of the dietaries at present in force for prisoners in the United Provinces. We shall now attempt to frame diet scales based, not on the gross chemical composition of the different food-materials as has been done in the case of the present dietaries, but on the real nutritive value of the food-stuffs as found by practical investigation.
138 CHAPTER VII. The Revision of the Jail Dietaries of the United Provinces and suggestions for New Scales. For the sake of ease of reference and clearness we reproduce here the table giving the jail dietaries in force in the United Provinces. Combination Diet. PRINCIPAL. ADJUVANT. Dal, Quantity.

Any vegetable diet that permits of an absorption of protein up to the standard attained on the average by the above diets will provide abundant carbonaceous material, and a potential energy sufficient for the needs of the body. The problem before us is, therefore, to devise combinations of the food- materials of the United Provinces that will permit of a degree of protein metabo- lism equal to the average level presented by the above dietaries and combinations that, at the same time, will attain a higher percentage of protein absorption, so that the waste of nitrogenous material from the bowel may be decreased to as great an extent as possible. The level of protein metabolism will depend on the extent to which the protein of the several food-stuffs entering into the composition of the diets is absorbed, and on the quantities of protein offered. We have determined the
139 percentage of protein absorption shown by the different food-materials in use to be:140 Diet C, in which the principal is makka or maize, we have not investiga- ted. It is never used, so far as we could gather, in the dietaries of the prisoners Maize we found in Bengal was a very good food-material, although not very palatable as prepared in Bengal Jails. It is not suitable alone for baking into bread or chapatti, but is very good when mixed with wheat or prepared as porridge. We do not think it suitable as a principal, as in Diet C, but see no reason why maize should not be given as a substitute for part of the wheat in dietaries. Why it should never be given in the jails of the United Provinces is difficult to understand, as, next to wheat, maize in the best cereal on the list. It is used during its season fairly largely by the inhabitants of the province, and the average crop being up to one million tons, there cannot be any great scarcity of this food to enhance its price. We are strongly of the opinion that maize has been neglected unjustly, and that, if given as we suggest, mixed with wheat, it would be found quite satisfactory. Probably, it has only been tried as in Diet C, which, being found unsatisfactory, no further test was made. We have no hesitation in saying from the results obtained in the Behar Jails that maize, given along with wheat, would show a protein absorption up to 70 per cent. Diet E is used practically to the exclusion of all others in the jails of the United Provinces. We have seen that it is much superior to any on the list, affording a metabolism of 11.64996 grms. of nitrogen per man daily. We consider this diet faulty in that it contains too much pulse, 3½ chittacks per man daily, and in that gram is usually given in the form of parched gram, with the result that the protein absorption is low, 64.2 per cent. This diet, however, could easily be transformed into a satisfactory one. There remains Diet A, which appears to us to be of the proper type, viz., a combination of two cereals, one to be wheat, with a pulse. The quanti- ties of the different food-stuffs could probably be better arranged than as given in the Jail Code. In our observations on the absorption of the protein of this diet, serial No. 8, the wheat in use was of very poor quality, so that it could hardly be looked on as a fair test. With good quality of wheat a diet of this type would show a level of nitrogenous metabolism quite up to the standard we require, and a percentage of protein absorption much higher than that obtainable with the present dietaries. We may conclude, therefore, that Diets A and E as types are worth retain- ing, although requiring modification. The remaining six dietaries are unsatis- factory and are not worth any further considerations. There is one more point, the importance of which we cannot emphasise too strongly, to be called to mind before proceeding to the working out of diet scales. That is the quality of the wheat to be used. It is absolutely essential,
141 if we are to know what the effect of a diet is to be, that when a certain quantity of wheat is ordered in a diet, that amount of wheat will be given, and not a mixture of wheat, barley, gram and other grains that are not food-materials at all. For instance, take the results shown by Diet A men- tioned above. We found that:142 easily obtainable in the United Provinces. In doing so we shall observe the following conditions:143 FOOD-STUFF.

It is considered to be particularly wholesome and digestible, and a thin gruel made from it is much used, mixed with cow's milk, for weaning children and as a diet for invalids. With first quality of wheat in use we believe the proper type of diet for inhabitants of the United Provinces to be a combination of wheat and another cereal with a pulse: the wheat to predominate. However, there are seasons of the year when most of the cereals except wheat are scare, so that it will be necessary to have a diet of the type of Diet E, viz., the combination of wheat with pulses, capable of being used when the other food-materials fail. With the option of several other good types of diets, there should be no necessity to keep prisoners on the diet we suggest of the type of Diet E for long periods, as is the case at present. Marua is an early rains crop and is available by August. Bajra and juar are available during the winter months. Barley is available most of the year and makka for several months. There is therefore a fairly wide choice of food- materials to select from over the greater part of the year. We shall now consider the framing of a diet, similar in type to Diet E of the Jail Code, for use during periods when other cereals, except wheat, fail or are so scare as to be comparatively expensive.
144 DIET I.145 considered the proper standard, viz., 2,810 calories in place of 3,260 calories fur- nished by the present dietaries. This heat value is still very high permitting of 52 calories per kilo of body-weight in place of 60 calories offered in present dietaries: both these figures being greater than that considered sufficient for Europeans. We might draw up the different points of contrast to show the distinctions clearly :146 It will be evident that Diets I (a) and I (b) are in reality substitutes for Diet E of the Jail Code, they should, therefore, be contrasted with Diet E and the distinctions noted. Thus:147 We shall now consider the framing of dietaries similar in type to Diet A of the Jail Code, i.e., the combination of wheat and another cereal with pulse. As these diets would be used during the period of the year when the different food-stuffs are fresh148 DIET II (b).149 The absorption from this diet will be 12.48136 grms. nitrogen, or 76.5 per cent. of the nitrogen of the diet. Reference to serial No. 36, where a diet of this type was investigated, will show even a better percentage of protein absorption than we calculate for this diet, viz., 77.6 per cent. The protein absorption from this diet provides just 1.2 grms. of the nitrogen per man daily more than is derived from the average of the present dietaries, thus affording a good measure of reserve. Some Superintendents prefer to give urid dal when juar forms part of the diet. There is no necessity for doing so when wheat and juar are given in combination. We have cooked this type of dietary hundreds of times and never found any difficulty. However, there is nothing further against urid dal entering into its composition than that it means a certain degree of lowering of the relative and absolute protein absorption; so that, if Superintendents desire, they could replace 1 chittack of arhar by a like quantity of urid dal. The effect or this would be to reduce the protein absorption to 12.2177 grms. nitrogen, or 74.6 per cent. of the nitrogen of the diet. We shall, however, leave the diet as arranged, giving Superintendents the option of substituting 1 chittack of urid dal for a similar quantity of arhar, if they so desire. Contrasted with the average of the present dietaries we get :150 The absorption from this diet will be 12.5716 grms. nitrogen, or 75.2 per cent. of the nitrogen of the diet. See also serial No. 45. This amount provides almost 1.3 grms. of nitrogen per man daily more than that of the average of the present dietaries. Urid dal is sometimes given when bajra forms part of a diet. Our ex- periments have not shown any necessity for this, when bajra and wheat are given combined as in above. However, it may be left to the option of Superintendents to give 1 chittack each of arhar and urid dals, instead of 2 chittacks of arhar. The effect of doing so would be to lower the relative and absolute absorption of protein to 12.30794 grms. nitrogen, or 73.4 per cent. of the nitrogen of the diet. We shall, however, leave the diet as arranged, giving Superintendents the option of modifying it in this manner if considered advisable. The diet can stand the substitution of 1 chittack of urid for the same amount of arhar dal, so far as the level of protein metabolism is concerned ; but it brings the amount of protein waste above 26 per cent., which we consi- der too high, we therefore do not recommend the change. Contrasted with the level of the present dietaries we get :151 combinations in such a way that there should be a metabolism of at least 12 grms. of nitrogen per man daily. We may accept this dietary on the condition that 2 chittacks of arhar dal shall always be given. This diet would therefore be152 Diet II (e) therefore is superior under every heading to the average of the present dietaries. Its carbohydrate and caloric values are too high, but they cannot be decreased without diminishing the level of protein metabolism below 12 grms. nitrogen per man daily, unless we increase the amount of pulse at the expense of the cereals, which we are not inclined to do. Two chittacks or over a quarter of a pound of pulse daily is quite as much as the intestinal tract can deal with satisfactorily; any large increase beyond this amount is likely to set up diarrhoea and irritation of the bowel. This completes our efforts on the framing of dietaries for use in the jails of the United Provinces. We shall now bring them together in tabular form in a manner similar to that made use of for the dietaries at present in force in the Jail Code. Table showing the new scales of Dietaries proposed.

154 These tables are simple and easily understood. It will be seen that we have been guided in the framing of these dietaries by the degree of protein absorption possible from them. In Diets I (a) and I (b) the level of protein metabolism has been arranged somewhat higher than in Diet II series. We have stated our reasons for this. Diet II series show a level of nitrogenous interchange of over 12 firms. nitrogen per man daily, on an average 1 grm. nitrogen higher than that attained by the prisoners on the dietaries at present in force. Our reason for arranging for a higher level of protein metabolism than is the case at present, is to have something in reserve. It may not always be possible to obtain wheat of first quality in the smaller jails but, if Superin- tendents of Jails insist on having clean wheat, even though it may contain a small proportion of barley, the results obtained will be quite up to what we have calculated for. We have not taken the protein content of wheat so high as it would be in a really first class sample and, as just mentioned, we have more than 1 grm. of nitrogen per man daily in reserve. Those precautions will do more than cover any defects in the food-stuffs likely to be met with, if the inspection of the food-materials be properly carried out. The dietaries we propose are superior in every respect to even the best of those now in use, and very much superior to all but Diet E of the Jail Code. We have no hesitation in stating that a trial will prove them to be absolutely satisfactory. As we have already pointed out, experience has shown that none of the present dietaries, except Diet E, are of any use in the feeding of prisoners, and that Superintendents are accustomed to devise nutritive mixtures, somewhat similar to our Diet II series, in order to make use of cereals other than wheat. We have standardised their efforts and shown exactly what combinations of wheat and other cereals with pulse will provide for practically identical degrees of protein metabolism, and. thus, as far as possible, ensure that the dietaries are all of equal value. We have considered the different food-materials very carefully and have tried to arrange the dietaries to suit their peculiarities. We do not consider that there should be any excuse, once these dietaries are introduced, for the almost complete neglect of all the cereals except wheat that obtains at the present time. For although at present the Jail Code permits Superintendents to combine any two of the different dietaries, by giving half of each, the dietaries derived in this manner are as little satisfactory as the originals. In serial No. 13 we give observations carried out on perhaps the best of the diets so derivable ; the results are not very promising. Indeed it could hardly be otherwise, for, except in the combinations A+G/2 and A+1½, the amount of wheat is too low in proportion to the other cereals and pulses.
155 The combinations we have suggested are those that appear to us the most suitable, but it will be quite a simple matter for Superintendents to work out for themselves the protein value and degree of protein absorption obtainable with other combinations, from the table we give showing the nitrogen content and nitrogen absorption per chittack of food-material on pages 145 and 146. By introducing the diets we suggest as the scales for the jails of the United Provinces, a much greater use can be made of the cereals, barley, makka, juar, bajra and manta, than has hitherto been the case. We have seen that these food-materials are very extensively cultivated and largely used by the inhabi- tants of the Province; there is no reason why they should not be made use of in the jails also. All we have done is to suggest the proper method of doing it. The following table, supplied through the kindness of the Director of Land Records and Agriculture of the United Provinces, gives some idea of the extent to which the several food crops are cultivated : Name of Crop. PERCENTAGES OF TOTAL CROPPED AREA. 1905-06. 1906-07. 1907-08.

Besides making the dietaries inside the prison walls much superior to what the same classes would live on outside, it deprives the prisoners of food- materials which are very palatable and of which they are very fond. Thus :156 Provinces and Bombay. Boiled with milk it forms a light and pleasant meal for invalids." (2) " Juar is one of the most important of the food crops of India; from it are prepared bread, porridge and other food preparations." (3) " Marua is much used by the poorer classes in Western India, usually in the form of porridge. It is considered to be practi- cally wholesome and digestible." (4) " Barley. The Hindus employ barley in the dietary of the sick. It is chiefly used in the form of sattu or powder of the parched grain." Judging from inquiries we have made, wheat is the food of the higher and middle classes and a luxury to the poorer. In times, of scarcity or famine, when wheat, gram and juar are practically the same in price, wheat is eaten largely by the people, but in ordinary times bajra and juar are the principal food-materials of the poorer classes and small cultivator. Makka or maize is also largely used as a food-material. Barley and marua not to so great an extent as the other cereals. Arhar dal is the favourite form of pulse, and a small amount is partaken of daily. It is, therefore, only right and fair to the prisoners that these secondary food-materials, bajrå, juar, makka, barley and marua, should not be denied them. While they are not suitable to be used alone, when given along with wheat, in the manner we have indicated in the diets suggested, they are ex- ceedingly useful in varying the monotony of the wheat diet, and in providing, food-materials to which the great mass of the prisoners are accustomed. In the framing of the dietaries proposed, we have always borne in mind the importance of lowering the excessive amount of carbohydrates and decreasing as much as possible, the caloric value of the present dietaries. While we have not succeeded to the extent we should like, the proposed scales show on the average a considerable diminution under these headings as compared with the dietaries at present in force. It is hopeless, however, to attempt to reduce the calories per kilo of body-weight to anything approaching the limits allowed Europeans, except by a radical change in the whole type of the dietaries. As we have already pointed out, the carbohydrate element and the heat value could be suitably decreased by a large addition to the amount of pulse at the expense of the cereals. This we consider a most reprehensible method of attaining our object, as, besides the effect of large quantities of dal in causing intestinal irritation and diarrhoea, it is contrary to the customs of the people. So far as we can gather, from extensive enquiries both in Bengal and in the United Provinces, it is only inside the walls of the jails that evidence can be obtained of dal ever being consumed in the quantities to be found in the
157 dietaries of the jails of Bengal and the United Provinces. The only other way of reducing the carbohydrates and heat value of the dietaries would be to change from a vegetarian to a mixed type of alimentation. Practical considerations of expense put such a suggestion out of court, besides which, it is unnecessary. The dietaries we have suggested are all that could be desired from a protein absorption standpoint, and while a mixed diet of animal and vegetable foods would permit of a great reduction of the carbohydrates and heat value, without decreasing the protein metabolism, it is open to the same objection as an increase in the pulse, viz., it is contrary to the customs of the people. We shall, therefore, have to rest satisfied with the reduction that has been found possible in. the suggested scales. The only other point, with regard to the proposed dietaries that we can think of as likely to form a basis for criticism, is the total quantities in actual weight of the diets. Reference to the extract from the Jail Code at the beginning of Chapter I will show the present dietaries to be so arranged that each weighs 18 chittacks, including vegetables. The maximum weight of any of the proposed diets is 17 chittacks, and the minimum 15½ chittacks; the most nutritious diet, of the eight suggested, being the one with the lowest weight. As we have intimated, we consider two pounds by weight of uncooked food-materials amply sufficient, when cooked, to ensure the necessary feelings of comfort and satis- faction that accompany a hearty meal. As the absorption from the suggested diets is in every instance considerably higher than with the present dietaries, it will be evident that the reduction in weight of the diets is brought about by getting rid of materials in the food-stuffs that are not absorbed and which, by their presence in the bowel, only tend to increase putrefaction and fermen- tation. That the weight we have mentioned is sufficient is shown by the fact that we never had any complaints from prisoners who were on diets of this and even lower weights. The weight of the dietaries of the people outside the jails averaged, so far as we could gather, 12 to 13 chittacks. In connection with what we have said regarding the neglect of makka, maize, or Indian corn as a food for human consumption in the jails of the United Provinces, we would point out that in America and in Italy it forms the principal food for the majority of the rural population.1 In 1900 one- third of all the land under cultivaticn in the United States was devoted to maize. The Americans have devised many different preparations, of which the most important are the different forms of meal, granulated corn meal, hominy, pop corn, etc. Many different methods of cooking are made use of ; 1 Food Value of Corn and Corn Products. By C. D. Woods, D.Sc., U. S. Dept. of Agr. Bull. No. 298.
158 for the Most part corn breads are of the unleavened or fiat bread type, and are granular rather than porous. They are usually baked in thin loaves or cakes, the meal being mixed with water or milk and baked in the ashes of the fire- place, or on a heated stone or blade of a hoe held over the coals. The method of baking often gives rise to special terms for the bread, as hoecakes, ashcakes or coriadodgers, Johnnycake, etc. The famous Boston brown bread is usually made with corn meal, rye and whole-wheat flour, and is cooked by steam in small loaves in tightly covered tins. The digestibility of foods made from corn has been investigated. Harcourt states that 74 per cent. of the protein and 99 per cent. of the carbohydrates of corn-meal mush are digested. From experiments at the Marine Experiment Station the digestibility of corn-meal mush would appear to be : Protein 73 per cent., carbohydrates 98 per cent., and available energy 93 per cent. From further work on the digestibility of corn bread of different sorts carried out at the Marine Experiment Station, the results indicate that the pro- tein of corn is slightly less thoroughly digested than that of wheat; but the difference is too slight to be of much practical consequence.1 " There are all sorts of popular notions about the effect of corn on the body. Thus one occasionally hears it said that it is indigestible and unfit for persons of weak digestion." " It is frequently spoken of as a good winter food, but as too ' heating' or ' heating to the blood' for summer. Just what these expressions mean it is not easy to say. Carefully conducted experiments have shown that as a rule the consumption and ingestion of carbohydrates and fats do not materially increase the output of the body-heat, but that protein does cause an increase in the amount radiated or otherwise given off from the body. Corn is not a typical protein food, as its protein content is not over 10 per cent., so it would hardly cause an appreciable increase in the output of heat from the body as compared with wheat or other common foods also supplying the different classes of nutrients in reasonable proportions. Corn is rich in fat and carbohy- drates. Fat is known to protect the body from extremes of temperature, and so, it may be that corn has been spoken of as a heating food, particularly valu- able in the winter diet, on account of its fat-producing properties. " In this connection it is interesting to note that corn has always been a more important food-stuff in the Southern United States, Mexico and the Mediterranean regions than in, the corresponding northern regions, even where 1Our experiments on the relative value of wheat and maize in Bengal Jails lead. us to the same conclusion. Scientific Memoirs, No. 37.
159 it is a common market commodity, and this would certainly indicate that there can be no reason for supposing that cold weather is more appropriate for the use of corn foods than warm. The most reasonable deduction from the available data is that the way corn dishes are prepared and cooked, and the foods with which they are combined are more important factors than climate in regulating the use of these foods, and that, rightly used, corn bread and other corn dishes are wholesome at all seasons. That it is wholesome and well-suited to its numerous uses as a food product is abundantly proved by its long-continued use under a great variety of circumstances and conditions, and the high opinion in which it has always been held. Scientific investigations have abundantly justi- fied the popular conclusions on the subject.°" 1 THE COST OF THE PRESENT DIETARIES. As the prices of food-grains vary considerably from year to year and even in different periods of the same year, it is difficult to work out even approxi- mately an average of the cost of the feeding of prisoners that is likely to be near the mark. However, it is not necessary for our purpose that we should get the absolute cost per head, all we want, in comparing the expense entailed in feeding the prisoners on the present °dietaries and on the suggested scales, is to take an average price of the different , food-stuffs and work out the relative difference in the cost of the two sets of dietaries. The following table gives the weekly price current of the food-grains in Allahabad for the week ending 9th November 1910:160 The first step is to find out the cost of the present dietaries on the above- basis. We have found that Diet E is used for nine months in the year and a mix- ture of other diets for the remaining three months. COST OF DIET E. Wheat 11½ chittacks 1.27777 annas.

None of these observations were made in the hot weather; those in Agra Jail were carried out in October while the weather was still comparatively hot, otherwise the average quantity of urine found to be excreted may be taken to refer to the cold weather. The quantity works out to be :166 This is a very much smaller amount than that found for the quantity of urine passed by prisoners in Bengal jails, which we have seen to average over 2,000 c.c. per man daily. We have no doubt the difference can be satisfactorily explained by the much lower salt content of the dietaries of the United Pro- vinces and the entire absence of rice.

171 By summing up these results and taking the average we obtain a fairly true measure of the weight of fresh fæces passed by the prisoners of the United Provinces when on the full dietaries sanctioned. The amount works out to be :172 (b) Decreasing the Wheat. Wheat 10 chittacks. Ordinary jail sample of wheat.

Contrasting this result with the average weight of moist fæces passed on Diet E, we get :173 So that, a decrease of 1½ chittacks, or about 3 ozs., of first class wheat causes a decrease of 1.59 ozs. in the weight of the corresponding fæces excreted. With ordinary jail wheat the lowering under the same condition was 2.36 ozs. of fæces, again showing how very much less waste there is with a good class of wheat than with inferior samples. Numerous other observations on the weight of moist fæces passed on vari- ous diets were carried out, in fact weighments of the fæces were done in every observation made on prisoners. The results show :174 Weight of fæces. Nitrogen of fæces.

177 By summing up these results and taking the average we obtain a fairly true measure of the average amount of nitrogen contained in the fæces excreted by prisoners of the United Provinces on the full jail dietaries sanctioned. It will be evident from the results shown in detail above, that the percentage of nitrogen in the fæces varies within very narrow limits whatever the diet may be. We called attention to this in the work on the Bengal Jail Dietaries, in which also the variations of the percentage of nitrogen in the fæces were small, even with absolutely dissimilar dietaries. How do the results of the investigations work out? (a) 477.91 lbs. of moist fæces contain 1914.46 grms. nitrogen. (b) 34.65 178 different food-stuffs made up totals other than 18 chittacks. We shall give some of the results and see what deductions can be drawn from them. (i) Other diets in which the total quantity of food-materials was either greater or less than 18 chittacks.

On the other hand, the percentage of nitrogen in the fæces is practically identical with that shown by the fæces when the prisoners were on the full jail dietaries, viz., 0.88 and 0.92 per cent. respectively. This again affords further proof of the constancy of the relative amount of nitrogen in the fæces, however different the dietaries may be. 2 B
186 CHAPTER IX. The Relationship of Food to Physical Development. In our report of the work on Bengal Jail Dietaries we discussed at some length the problems in nutrition raised by Chittenden. We are exceedingly interested in the question of the degree of nitrogenous interchange essential for the proper well-being of the body, and on the effects of a low level of protein metabolism. We have therefore tried to take advantage of every opportunity this work on the food-stuffs of India affords of obtaining evidence of the effect of food on the physical condition of the different races and tribes with whom we have had to deal. From the evidence we were able to collect in Bengal from observations on students, servants, prisoners, inhabitants of Lower Bengal, Beharis, and on the different hill-tribes around Darjeeling, we arrived at the conclusion that an intimate connection exists between the physical development and general well- being of a people and the level of nitrogenous interchange they attain, and that diet is a powerful factor in determining the position of a tribe or race in the scale of mankind. We found that, as was the case with the inhabitants of the plains in Bengal so with the hill-tribes around Darjeeling, variations in the amount of nitrogenous metabolism appear to be the determining factor of the several causes that go to relegate, fix and maintain the position of a people, tribe or race in the category of men. We showed with regard to the scale of relative physical development, vigour and general muscularity, that the position of the different races of Bengal was easily fixed. We gave the following list1 showing the position of the different races or tribes and also indicating the average levels of nitrogenous metabolism attained :187 We shall now endeavour to bring forward the evidence we have been able to obtain amongst the inhabitants of the United Provinces of the rôle played by diet in the general development and well-being of the people. This we shall take up under two headings :188 " The two principal meals are taken in the morning and evening and consist of unleavened cakes called chapatis, made of flour of wheat, barley or millet (bajra, juar or marua), according to the means of the consumer. With these are eaten vegetables and pulse cooked with clarified butter (ghi). Rice is often substituted in the central and eastern districts, but is less used in the West, except by the well-to-do. Sweet cakes are eaten in the middle of the day or early afternoon and often at the evening meal. Mutton and beef are uni- versally used by the Musalmans, and mutton by the high-caste Hindus of the Saiva sects, and by the lower caste Hindus when they can afford it. The poorest classes make their principal meal in the evening, and in the morning eat some parched grain or gram in the western districts, barley or rice in the eastern and maize everywhere. Mangoes and, where found, the mahua flower (Bassia latifolia), form an important addition in the hot season. Potatoes are com- monly eaten in the hills, and their use is spreading in the plains." " In 1901, out of total population of 47,691,782, Hindus numbered 40,691,818, or more than 85 per cent., and Musalmans 6,731,034, or 14 per cent. The Musalmans dwelling in the Provinces are more prolific than the Hindus, and longer lived, partly because, on the whole they are better off, enjoy a more liberal diet, form a large proportion of the total in the more prosperous western districts, do not practise child-marriage largely and allow re-marriage of widows." What evidence is there that the effect of the higher level of protein metabolism amongst the inhabitants of the United Provinces is to the advan- tage of their physical development and general well-being ? From observations on representatives of the inhabitants within the prisons where investigations were carried out, we would have no hesitation in saying that, compared with the same classes in the jails of Lower Bengal, on the average the inhabitants of the United Provinces are on a distinctly higher plane of physical development. The general muscularity of the body is de- cidedly better and their capabilities for labour are greater. They are smarter on their feet, more brisk and more alive to the incidents of every-day life, and they do not present such slackness and tonelessness as one is accustomed to observe in the people of Lower Bengal. The body-weight, and what is in reality of most importance, the actual quantity of protoplasmic tissues, is also on a higher scale of development. The average weight of the inhabitants of Bengal, including Behar, has been estimated at 50.0 kilos.1 From observations on weighments of over 2,000 prisoners in the jails of the United Provinces, the average body-weight of the prisoner may be accepted 1Scientific Memoirs, No. 34.
189 to be about 54 to 56 kilos. Taking the average body-weight at 55 kilos and the protein metabolism at 9.25 grms. of nitrogen per man daily, this would mean a daily interchange of 0.168 grms. of nitrogen per kilo of body-weight, as compared with 0.116 grm. per kilo of body-weight in the case of the Ben- gali and Ooriya, and 0.145 grm. with the Behari. The prisoners of the United Provinces with their average level of 11.286 grms. of nitrogenous metabolism show an interchange of 0.205 grm. of nitro- gen per kilo of body-weight, compared with 0.151 grm. of nitrogen in Bengali prisoners and 0.173 grm. of nitrogen in Behari prisoners per kilo of body- weight. It may, therefore, be accepted, so far as the evidence afforded by prisoners goes, that on an average they attain a protein metabolism of 0.205 grm. of nitrogen per kilo of body-weight (a quantity very much in excess of what Chittenden would consider sufficient, viz., 0.12 grm.); that the average body- weight may be taken at 55 kilos.; that the average level of nitrogenous meta- bolism attained by the general population of the provinces is about 0.168 grm. of nitrogen per kilo of body-weight; that the people of the United Provinces are better fed, better developed physically, more capable of hard work, hardier and more alive than the average inhabitant of Bengal of the same class. The United Provinces contain several of the different tribes or races that have been found suitable for warlike purposes. Thus, there are the Brahmins, Rajputs, Jats, etc., and others who present the necessary characteristics and qualities that go to make up the soldier. We shall have more to say on these races under our next heading; all we need say at present is that the evidence would clearly point to a close relationship between the level of protein inter- change and the degree of physical development to be expected. Practically all other explanations, that have been put forward to account for the poor physique of the races on a low level of protein metabolism, can be successfully met by a comparison of the inhabitants of the United Provinces with the people of Bengal. Early marriages, actinic rays of the sun, sexual excesses, etc., are, to all intents and purposes, the same in the United Provinces as in Bengal. Climate does differ in the two provinces to some extent: in Bengal the tempera- ture is lower and humidity higher than in the United Provinces; but, while the climate of the United Provinces is on the whole perhaps less depressing than that of Bengal, the difference is not such as to be able to account for the well recognised characteristics of the Bengali and those of the fighting races of the plains of Agra and Oudh. We have nothing to add to what has already been pointed out1 with regard to this except to affirm again our strong belief in the efficacy of a liberal diet, and more particularly a sufficiently liberal degree 1Scientific Memoirs, No. 37, page 210.
190 of nitrogenous interchange, in the formation and development of those attri- butes and qualities of mind and body that are alike the pride of the soldier and the envy of inferior races. II.191 iv. Information as to the physical development, height, chest girth and body-weight. We shall take up the information obtained in this way under the headings of the several races or tribes represented in the different regiments192 by Changes in diet. Their soldierly instincts are undoubtedly great; and though not so sturdy as some of the other races of northern India, their claim to be regarded as good fighting material is valid.1 2.

Their country is most fertile yielding large quantities of various cereals and fruits. The hills abound in cattle of good breed, and agriculture is carried on with intelligence and care, producing large crops. Ethnologically the Dogras are of the same blood and race as the Rajputs of the plains: the main difference between the Dogras and the Rajputs of the Punjab and Rajputana is that the former have a keener sense of national pride and a higher feeling of national integrity. They are on the whole of finer physique than the plain Rajputs. Dogra recruits, caught young, while there is yet time for good physical development to take place, soon fill out with liberal feeding, drill, and systematic exercises. The general appearance of a Dogra regiment leaves nothing to be desired. "Their steady and resolute, though not showy, courage, renders them very reliable soldiers, and they justly enjoy the reputation of being among the best fighting material to be found in the country." [Bonarjee.] Food-stuffs.196 Although wheat is the staple food, in their own homes they also eat bajra, maize, juar and other inferior cereals; when these form the main items, how- ever, more milk, curd, buttermilk and. ghi are taken in addition. Goat's flesh, mutton, venison, pork, and occasionally hares, porcupine, etc., are all eaten when procurable, but not in large quantities. Milk, ghi, curds, buttermilk are largely consumed, as all are agriculturists and peasant proprietors with buffaloes and cows in their possession. Eggs are rarely eaten, as few of them keep fowls. Fish is used by such men as live near rivers, but does not enter largely into their dietary. The dietary as outlined above is distinctly of a superior type. Being agriculturists and peasant proprietors a full sufficiency of all the food-stuffs available from the land is ensured, and the addition of a free supply of milk to a fairly liberal diet in other respects, particularly in animal food, would mean a high level of protein interchange. Physical development.197 (i) The food-stuffs made use of in the Regiment. (a) Recruits.198 (b) At 2½ years of age the child is weaned. He is then given four meals a day consisting of the following food-stuffs, roughly in the quantities given below:199 fighting man than most of those on whom observations have been made. We have no hesitation in saying that the dietary of the Sikh is superior to that of any of the tribes so far considered, and, failing any other explanation of his superior qualities, we must admit the determining influence of the high level of protein metabolism attained during the more important early years of life, the period in which the body framework and protoplasmic tissues are being built up. As we have already pointed out in a comparison of the hill-tribes of Bengal,1 we are very strongly of the opinion that physique, stamina, energy and general manly qualities are closely dependent on the degree of nitrogenous interchange possible from the dietary. We believe that climate and certain customs, such as early marriages, sexual excesses, etc., have an undoubted influence on the physical development and general well-being of the different tribes, but, where it is possible to eliminate climate and caste influences, as in a comparison of tribes living under the same condition but on different dietaries, there can be no doubt of the superiority of the physical development of those tribes whose diet is the most liberal and whose daily average of metabolised nitrogen reaches a high level. This is clearly brought to light in a study of the races and tribes inhabiting the great plains of Bengal, United Provinces and the Punjab: as an extreme case, we may take as an example the Sikh and the Behari. These races live under practically identical condi- tions as to caste obligations, and climate forms no great determining factor in the Sikh's favour, yet in the Sikh we obtain men of good physique and splendid fighting qualities, while in the Behari the qualifications essential for the soldier are so little in evidence that his claims for a martial life are entirely overlooked. The Behari we found lives on a protein metabolism of 8 to 9 grms. of nitrogen, whilst the Sikh reaches a level of 12 to 14 grms. of nitrogen per man daily. We wish for no stronger evidence than this of the effect of a high level of protein metabolism on the physical development and formation of those manly characteristics that enforce respect, and relegate a tribe or race to its proper position amongst the inhabitants of India. Having seen the results of dietaries offering varying quantities of assimilable protein on different tribes, otherwise under similar conditions, we are firmly of the opinion that the level of protein interchange advocated by Chittenden is too low, and that a liberal supply of assimilable nitrogen in the daily food is to the advantage of the individual and to the welfare of the race. 1 Scientific Memoirs, No. 37.
