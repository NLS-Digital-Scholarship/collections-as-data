ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1909-1910. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. Colonel H. T. Pease, C.I.E., was in charge of the Department for the whole of the year and some of the im- portant sections embodied in this report were drafted out by him before proceeding on furlough in June 1910. Preface. 2. As usual, a coloured Map and the prescribed Tables are appended. It may be mentioned that the colouring on the map has been somewhat altered to indicate more clearly and accurately the horse and cattle breeding districts worked under the administration of the Civil Veterinary Department. 3. The table below gives the names of the officers who held the several appointments in the Department during the year under report:2 4. During the year, Mr. G. D. Martin resigned his appointment on termination of his leave in September 1909. Lieutenant-Colonel W. D. Gunn retired in December 1909 on attaining the age of 55 years; and the regrettable death of Lieutenant-Colonel F. Joslen was reported in February 1910. 5. The following officers were on leave in England at the close of the year:3 12. The teaching staff practically remained unchanged. Mr. E. Burke, Deputy Superintendent, was transferred from Hissar to the post of Professor of Surgery at this College, vice Captain Dawson transferred to Madras. 13. The Examiners in their report remarked as follows:4 to improving the general practical knowledge of the students. The Principal of the College attributes the fall in the percentage of passes to the &quot;very large number of non-matriculated and badly educated students admitted during the three previous years.&quot; 26. The total number of patients treated in the hospital attached to the College was 2,074 and the amount realized in fees, etc., amounted to R14,243-2-10, which is very satisfactory. The number of operations per- formed aggregating 916, viz., 514 in-patients and 402 out-patients. 27. The Museum is reported to have been further equipped by the addi- tion of valuable models and instruments. Land adjoining the College grounds has been acquired for a recreation ground for the students and for building purposes. 28. A Bacteriological Laboratory and Pharmacy are reported to have been sanctioned, which will afford greater facilities for teaching students in contagious diseases of animals. 29. Burma.5 38. The total mortality reported, as compared with the previous year, is as follows:6 figures are shown in an appendix which is not a prescribed form and may be detailed as follows:7 63. Central Provinces.8 in Mymensingh where the mortality was reduced from 1,101 to 658; in Backerganj from 8,132 to 1,345; in Noakhali from 1,077 to 143; and Goalpara from 5,405 to 462. 78.

The important subject of surra has been further studied, (1) with a view to devising methods of prophylaxis, and (2) to find an effective treat- ment. In regard to (1), the advice given by Mr. Leese is of a practical nature, founded on the accepted fact that the disease is carried from sick to healthy by the bites of flies. The broad principles involved are the weeding out of surra infected camels and the avoidance of surra zones. The provision of surra free grazing for Silladar Camel Corps is a most important measure and the remarks made by Mr. Leese on this subject deserve very serious consideration, if surra is to be diminished in the Corps. 137. Mr. Leese truly says in regard to prophylaxis, that no excuse need be made for repeating a good deal of what has been said on the subject in previous reports. The most important requirement for prophylaxis is surra free grazing in the monsoon season for Corps Camels, having secured that the mortality would be less and the demand for remounts also. The next requirement is surra free grazing for camel breeding. 138. The summary of the condition of the various cadres in regard to their infection with surra is valuable as an indication of the efficiency of the measures recommended to prevent mortality. It shows that weeding out of surra cases does very greatly reduce the prevalence of the disease in future years. It is a pity therefore that more attention is not in some cases given to the routine examination of camels for this purpose. 139. It has been suggested that working isolation of camels might be practicable in the Punjab, but this is shown to be unworkable owing to lack of space and danger to healthy animals. July, August and September 1909 were spent touring in the grazing grounds with the primary object of defi- nitely ascertaining which were surra free. The mapping out of the surra and surra free zones must necessarily be very slow, as in only three months in the year is this kind of work possible and they are unfortunately the most difficult to travel in. The work involves great exposure in very unhealthy country owing to the fact that it must be carried out during and after the rainy season and in country covered with jungle and reeking with malaria. The good progress which has been made in the work, therefore, is very credit- able indeed. 140. In regard to the experimental treatment of surra, considering that no accommodation has been provided for the experimental animals, the pro- gress made is extraordinarily good. Mr. Leese has submitted two reports (which are being separately published) on the subject, giving details of the experiments made with (1) Tartar emetic alone, (2) Tartar emetic and Atoxyl alternately, (3) Tartar emetic alone followed by a short course of mercuric bichloride alone, (4) Orpiment, (5) Antimony sulphide by the mouth, (6) Soamin, (7) White arsenic, (8) Arsenic in powder, (9) Arsenic in solution in various forms as (a) Solution of sodium arsenate, (b) Liquor arsenicalis, (c) Donovans solution, (d) Solution of arsenious iodide, (e) Solution of sodium arsenite. (10) Methylene blue and mercuric bichloride, (11) Soamin and sodium arsenate, (12) Soamin and antimony tartarate, (13) Atoxyl, soamin and sodium arsenate, (14) Atoxyl, antimony and sodium arsenate. Contrary to what has been found to be the case in the horse, no successful treatment has been yet obtained, but the results of some combinations are somewhat encouraging. It is interesting as well as discouraging to note that camel surra offers a separate problem for solution. The experiments are being continued. 141. The remarks made by Mr. Leese regarding compensation for slaughter of surra camels are worthy of attention. He points out that no loss is involved in the slaughter of a surra camel which is too weak to use under a load or is suffering from coincident unsoundness such as chronic blindness or lameness and that compensation should only be given for the slaughter of a camel in the public interest when it is still capable of ordinary work. With this I agree. 142. Various contagious and other diseases of the camel have also been studied as opportunity occurred, but lack of accommodation proved a serious drawback. It is interesting to find that little evidence now remains to show
13 that foot and mouth disease occurs in the camel. Jhooling has been found to be contagious. A form of specific peritonitis was met with in the Montgomery district. A separate report is being prepared regarding Filariasis. Various other diseases have been studied and noted on. 143. Three parasites have been added to the check list, i.e., Thelazia leesei, a new parasite, causing ophthalmia, T14 was transferred to the Army Remount Department, and a new hospital, in place of the one at Sargoda, was opened at Sahiwal. It is expected that a new hospital will be built next year at Bhawani as Lala Tara Chand, Rais of Bhawani, has presented the District Board with a sum of R7,000 for that purpose. 154. In Eastern Bengal and Assam there has been no addition to the number of Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. Sixteen thousand three hundred and forty-one (16,341) in and out-patients were treated against 15,390 in the previous year. As the Veterinary Assistants in charge of these institutions have also to tour in the districts, attend outbreaks of disease and inspect dâk lines, etc., the amount of work done may be considered very satisfactory. 155. In the North-West Frontier Province and North Punjab the total number of Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries remained the same, but under the revised system, introduced during the year under report, stationary men have been put in charge of these institutions: in addition to which one itinerating Veterinary Assistant has been appointed to each district. This system has answered satisfactorily in most places, but in several instances the stationary men had to render help in attending outbreaks, necessitating the hospital being temporarily closed. Gradually, with the appointment of suitable men to the districts this difficulty will be overcome. Thirty-nine thousand three hundred and twenty (39,320) animals were treated against 21,349 in the previous year. The increase is very satisfactory. New hospitals are to be built at Peshawar, Mardan and Tonk. 156. In the United Provinces 3 new Veterinary hospitals were opened, viz., at Saharanpur, Bareilly and Moradabad, while others are about to be built at Sitapur, Meerut and Cawnpore. New premises for the Lucknow and Aligarh hospitals are being taken in hand and the building of institutions of this kind in other districts are under consideration. A very satisfactory increase in the number of cases treated is apparent, viz., 34,634 against 23,878 last year, indicative of the growing popularity of these institutions. 157. Five additional Veterinary hospitals were opened in the Madras Presidency during the year, and proposals for starting 6 others are under consideration. The number of cases treated show a satisfactory increase, being 45,461 against 35,234 last year. In addition to this 2,074 cases were treated at the Madras Veterinary College. 158. In the Central Provinces the number of Veterinary dispensaries remain unaltered. The total number of animals treated was 58,271 against 56,591, showing an increase of 1,680 during the year. It is stated that new Camp dispensaries were opened at 7 centres. 159. In Sind the number of Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries remained the same as last year. The number of cases treated show a decrease of 1,398, viz., 11,832 against 13,230 last year. This is reported by the Superintendent to be chiefly accounted for by inoculation cases having been excluded from this year's figures. 160. In Rajputana there are 2 Veterinary dispensaries, the same number as last year. The total number of cases treated was 828 against 1,289 last year. The decrease is reported to be due to the post of Veterinary Assistant at one of the dispensaries having been vacant for 7 months; and also to the prevalence of plague during the year, both in the Ajmer and Beawar districts. 161. In Baluchistan there are no Veterinary hospitals or dispensaries. 162. Four new Veterinary dispensaries have been added to last year's number in Burma. A satisfactory increase in the number of cases treated is noted, viz., 17,043 against 10,739 in the previous year. These figures do not include the 298 cases treated by Inspectors and 26 by Veterinary Assist- ants in Shan States. 163. Table VI shows the receipts and expenditure on Veterinary hospitals during the year. As compared with last year's figures, the financial results of these institutions are satisfactory. 164. Table VII shows the total strength of the subordinate Veterinary staff. There were 65 Veterinary Inspectors and 688 Veterinary Assistants employed against 50 and 616 respectively last year.
15 III.16 influential Raises and other gentlemen interested in cattle breeding and who have sufficient grazing on their Estates, by placing under their care small herds of 10 or 15 selected male calves to be reared until fit for issue as stud bulls. In the Central Provinces the Superintendent states that there are signs of greater interest being taken in cattle breeding, especially in the Chhatis- garh Division. Four Malguzars are reported to have purchased about 50 cows and a bull, with which they intend to specialise in cattle breeding, and that certain Court of Wards and Zamindars have definitely arranged to start farms. Bull rearing and breeding Farms and Depôts, 175. The main results of the working of Provincial Cattle Farms are given in Table IX. 176. In Bengal, at the Siripur Farm there were 44 cows, of which 9 were Farm bred. During the year 42 calves were born of which 3 died. Ten bull calves and 2 heifers were selected, and 2 cows and nine heifer calves were rejected and sold. The Agricultural Department at Pusa having decided to give up the desi herd of cattle, handed it over unconditionally to the Court of Wards, Bettiah. The herd consists of 1 bull, 45 cows and 42 young stock, together with 4 bulls which were sent to Siripur to be reared. It is intended to establish this Farm at Manjheria, about 4 miles from Bettiah. At the Kalimpong Farm there were 15 cows, and one bull was purchased in Febru- ary 1910. 177. At &quot;The Northcote Cattle Farm,&quot; Chharodi, in the Bombay Presi- dency, the herd consisted of 323 head against 340 last year. The decrease is due to the disposal of all unsuitable stock. Sixty calves were dropped during the year, against 95 last year. Sixteen young bulls were sold for stud pur- poses against 7 last year. There was no contagious disease among the Farm cattle, although several villages in the vicinity were affected. 178. At the Upper Shillong Farm, in Eastern Bengal and Assam, there were 82 head of cattle including 10 bulls and 21 cows. Sixteen calves were dropped. Six young bulls are ready to be distributed. Seven cows, 18 heifers and 6 calves were sold. One cow, 4 calves and 1 bullock died. Arrangements are being made to secure good grazing ground near Burapani, as during the winter months there is not sufficient food for the herd at the Upper Farm. Camel breeding. 179. An attempt has been made to encourage the breeding of camels in the Punjab by the grant of substantial prizes for various classes of these ani- mals at some of the Punjab Fairs. The Commandants of the various Silladar Camel Corps have subscribed R1,700 which has been allotted to the following centres :17 country-breds), 13 ponies and 6 donkeys were purchased during the year. Those died, destroyed and sold aggregated 20, leaving a balance at the end of the year of 71 horses, 105 ponies and 100 donkey stallions. They were distributed as follows:18 Veterinary Assistants, as a whole, is not high. In fact some of them have degenerated into mere empirics and some are incompetent. There is great need for improvement in this respect and the question of establishing post graduate courses was mooted during the year under report.&quot; 190. Punjab states &quot;The subordinate staff continues to improve in efficiency. Much depends upon the degree and quality of supervision of the Inspectors who, generally, have worked well&quot;. Proposals have been sub- mitted for an increase in the number of Veterinary Inspectors and also in the reserve staff which is found to be quite inadequate. 191. North-West Frontier Province and North Punjab.19 PART B.20 districts from which animals are purchased. Foot and mouth disease remained throughout the whole year. Mr. Grundy, the purchasing Agent, was unable to obtain more than half the supply of bulls required each month. Of the bulls received, the majority arrived with severe lesions of foot and mouth disease. Few of the bulls were in suitable condition and there was a large percentage of calves and very old animals. The following is a statement of the animals received with, a record of their condition :21 215. The investigation into methods of immunizing against anthrax had to be suspended owing to the difficulties previously explained. Experi- mental immunization by vaccination is being carried on and it is hoped to issue a report on this work at an early date. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia. 216. During the past official year, 8,320 doses of Hæmorrhagic Septi- cæmia vaccine were prepared and with the previous year's balance 9,960 doses in all were issued. 217. Further tests of the serum have been carried out on ponies and buffaloes. The results have been as satisfactory as heretofore and confirmed the view that serum is a safe and effectual agent for conferring a passive immunity and the vaccine an active one. 218. From the following table the result of injections carried out in the field will be seen :22 222. Strangles.23 228. During the year 1909-10 the following doses of sera were prepared and issued from the Muktesar Laboratory :24 229. Research.25 trypanosomiasis and various experiments with a view to prepare serum from plains animals were carried out. 238. I have much pleasure in recording the excellent work which has been done during the year. The whole of the staff has continued to carry out their duties zealously under the most trying and discouraging conditions. The work done in the experimental treatment of surra has been attended by the most brilliant results and very great credit is due to Captain Holmes, Mr. Cross and Dr. Hartley for the results achieved. Mr. Cross, on whom the actual treatment of the horses devolved, was most zealous in the performance of his duties, and to him much of the success is due. GOVERNMENT CATTLE FARM, HISSAR. 239. Major (now Lieutenant-Colonel) J. Farmer was in charge of the Farm during the year. Mr. E. Burke, Deputy Superintendent, was trans- ferred to the Punjab Veterinary College in December 1909 and his post remained vacant owing to the impossibility of finding a suitable officer to fill it. Much extra work was in consequence thrown on the Superintendent who is much overworked. 240. There has been no change in policy during the year, the system which has so far given good results having been adhered to. I am glad to report that the operations at the Farm have been successful and that there has been continued all round improvement. 241. The period for which the sanction of Government was accorded to the management of the Farm by this Department having expired, a special report on the operations carried on for the last four years has already been submitted for consideration. This report gives details of all matters dealt with at the Farm and is already in the hands of the Government of India. 242. The Farm year has been an average one. The rains were good but there was an unfortunate break in July which injured the barani crops. We were particularly unfortunate regarding outbreaks of contagious disease, rinderpest, foot and mouth disease, black quarter having occurred amongst the cattle and sheep and strangles and infectious pneumonia in the mules and donkeys. 243. Rinderpest broke out in the Sully herds in July 1909, the total number of animals exposed to contagion being 439, of which 41 became affected and 22 died. Fortunately, the disease was early diagnosed and pre- cautions of segregation, etc., adopted. There was some delay in obtaining serum, but eventually 376 animals which had been exposed to contagion, were injected with anti-rinderpest serum which stopped the outbreak. 244. Rinderpest also broke out amongst the Merinos in October 1909 and four deaths occurred. Thirty-four were inoculated. 245. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia also occurred in October 1909 and there were 7 deaths. 246. Foot and mouth disease appeared in May and affected all the animals. It was not severe and caused no deaths. When flies are prevalent the disease is very troublesome as it is difficult to prevent maggots in the wounds. 247. Occasional cases of Charbon Symptomatique still occur, although we inoculate all stock at weaning time with Blacklegoids. The following table gives the cases which have occurred and the time which elapsed since they were inoculated :26 Serial No. Number. Inoculated on Attacked on Interval between inoculation and attack.

Forty-two animals became infected, and of these 15 died and 27 recovered. The source of this infection is unknown. It started in the donkeys and spread rapidly until the animals were segregated. It ceased on the 7th May. 250. It is impossible to keep the Farm animals free from contagious disease to which they are exposed on all sides. Constant watchfulness and early and energetic action is consequently necessary should any disease gain entry. The manner in which the outbreaks have been dealt with reflects great credit on the Superintendent and his staff. 251. Table XVI gives a complete return of the animals on the Farm for 1909-10, and it is only necessary for me to mention here the changes which have occurred during the year. 252. Herd bulls.28 261.

The value of the Farm, however, cannot be expressed in figures, for in addition to supplying animals to Government, District Boards, etc., at a nominal rate, the like of which cannot be obtained elsewhere, the Farm is an object lesson to breeders in the surrounding country and is the only source of supply of stud bulls of the type famous in Harriana to which our herds have been bred. 270. Lieutenant-Colonel Farmer has worked very hard during the year and the results achieved are due to his zeal and energy. He brings to notice the good work done by Lieutenant Morris, Farm Overseer ; Mr. MacCutchan, Farm Bailiff ; and Veterinary Assistant Ghulam Hussain. The post of Deputy Superintendent fell vacant in December and it has been found im- possible to fill it again so far. The Superintendent is much overworked at present and the question of giving him some assistance is under consideration. PART C.30 TABLE I.
