FROM THE SURGEON GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, TO THIS, SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, GENERAL DEPARTMENT, Bombay, 4th September 1874. SIR, I have the honour to forward the Annual Report on the Lunatic Asylums in Bombay and Sind for the year 1873-74. Government having laid down in Government Resolution No. 1087, dated 15th April 1874, that the most important thing to be remembered is that all statistical tables should be uniform, a series of tables has been compiled in my office, and issued for the guidance of the officers in charge of lunatic asylums. This has secured a fair degree of uniformity in the tables, complete indeed, for all the asylums, except Kolaba, in which the presence of Europeans necessitated some additions to the number. But, whilst making this first attempt at uniformity in the tables, time did not admit of a model being framed upon which the reports of the superintendents should be based. This I shall endeavour to arrange in future. The report is made up in the following manner :2 The two together give a description of all the lunatics under cognizance of the Medical Department. The report of each asylum is given by its superintendent, and each Deputy Surgeon General records his own observations and experience. The tables at the end of the report will be found to give the statistics of each asylum separately, and there is at the bottom of each table an abstract of all the asylums collectively. My own report is concerned with the general results deduced from abstracts of the forms of all the asylums, and of all the insanes treated out of asylums, with general remarks upon lunacy as seen in this presidency, as well as upon the working of the individual lunatic asylums.

Other castes ... ... 14.3 20.0 The proportion of females to total treated for 1872-73 was 16.4 per cent. and in 1873-74 16.5, whilst the relative frequency of lunacy in the sexes and in each class is given in the margin. The proportion of females to males as exhibited by these figures is in very striking con- trast to what obtains in some parts England. In this presidency, other castes being excluded on account of their small numbers, there are 20 Hindoo female insanes to 100 males, and 17 Mussulmans to 100 males, whilst in England, taking an average of seven years from one of our large county asylums (Essex), there were 136.2 female insanes to 100 males. A good authority,* however, writes :4 GENERAL REMARKS. The general health of the inmates of all the asyluns been favourably reported on. The complaint of want of information regarding new patients is made by all the medical superintendents. Dr. Niven calls particular attention to this, and since this report was commenced, I have received a letter from him, in which he points out that, out of 18 criminal lunatics, in 10 no infor- mation was given, while in the remainder it was as scanty as could be. It is to be regretted patients are sent to asylums, either with very im- perfect information regarding them, or, as too frequently happens, without any history of their previous state. I would suggest that Government be pleased to direct that no insane be received into an asylum without some history of the case being furnished at the time, unless it be stated that none such could be obtained. So little inquiry has been made in some cases, that Deputy Surgeon General Maitland mentions as a subject of complaint that lunatics, as a rule, are sent to asylums with blank history sheets, instances being recorded in which their names were unknown. In support of this, he gives the large number, 92 per cent., of insanes in which the causes of the disease were unknown to the medical officers. A consequence of this want of information regarding most of the inmates is that not much confidence can be placed in the table of assigned causes, though the chief are said to be the excessive use of ganja and other deleterious drugs. It is not always easy to define, with anything like accuracy, the factorship of mental disease, and, therefore, statistics must not be relied on as being free from error. The etiology of insanity is beset with difficulties and complications. For instance, intemperance is put down as the most frequent cause of insanity, but in how many of the cases could they be traced to the earliest symptoms of the mental alienation, would it be found to be only a result. This taste for drink is often hereditarily transmitted, and the origin of the malady found to be due to the habitual intoxication of the parents. In this country, where the sale of intoxicating liquors, and liquors apparently of so deleterious a character, is so unrestricted, and the use and abuse of them amongst the poorer classes seemingly on the increase, would it not be a wise precautionary measure on the part of the Government, and possibly prevent an increase in the number of insanes which may otherwise be looked for, were the sale of these in some measure restricted, and their adulteration better looked after and punished ? All the medical officers agree that debauchery is the most fruitful source of insanity. Dr. Wyllie does not consider the abuse of opium alone a cause, though the combined use of this with other drugs is, in his opinion, a most efficient one. While Dr. Beatty attributes the greater preva- lence of mental disease amongst males to this, Dr. Lord does not think the proportion between the sexes holds good in this more than in ordinary diseases, as exemplified at the Poona Civil Hospital, but is rather disposed to believe it duo to the females being kept at home by their friends, unless in eases of poverty,or of those who are troublesome. Tobacco, when indulged in to excess and in some cases even its moderate use, may considerably affect the functions of the entire nervous system. Although there seem to be no facta
5 which might lead us to suppose that tobacco alone can become a cause of insanity, still it cannot be denied that in many individuals, with weak and disturbed mental functions, it may co-operate to this end. In this country, where malarious fever prevails to so great extent, sta- tistics of its relation to mental disease would be highly desirable, and information as to whether, in localities where intermittent fever is endemic instead of the ordinary ague, any individuals have been attacked by an intermittent cerebral affection, and if any such have passed into cases of chro- nic mental disease. The treatment has been rather hygienic and moral than medical. Mechanical restraint has been had recourse to only in one instance, mentioned in the remarks upon the Colaba Asylum. The advantages of the total banish- ment of all means of mechanical restraint from the treatment of insanity have been both praised and disputed. The principal argument in favour of this system is its greater humanity and its easier quieting of the patient, who is often rendered more irritable by mechanical coercion. There is no doubt that the modern treatment of insanity is much more successful than the old system. Yet even now the true state of things is sufficiently discouraging. Dr. Edgar Sheppard, quoting Dr. Thurnam, who is great in the statistics of mental disease, says that, " of ten persons attacked by insanity, five recover, and five die sooner or later during the attack. Of the five who recover not more than two remain well during the rest of their lives; the other throe sustain subsequent attacks during which, at least, two of them die." All recoveries cannot, therefore, be regarded as permanent or stable ; and the broad rule may be laid down, that when insanity has once exhibited itself, there is ever afterwards a tendency to relapse; and of the insane in public asylums for the reception of all classes, about 70 per cent. may be reckoned as incurable. A primary consideration, and indeed the most important as regards the question of curability, is the form of the insanity and the period of the disease All the Superintendents agree in the great value of outdoor employ- ment as a curative means. This will be more particularly alluded to in the remarks upon the individual asylums. A celebrated German Physician, Griesinger, from whose work on mental diseases I have already quoted, writes : "No asylum is complete which has not space sufficient to admit of prolonged outdoor exercise for all classes of its inmates, in gardens, airing courts, &c. In many chronic cases it is highly beneficial to prescribe gymnastic exercises and cheerful games which necessitate exercise, where, in the harmless excitement of the game, the patient for a time forgets self and the thoughts which harass him. " When will all our asylums, instead of being as they are at prosent chiefly houses of refugo for the insane, bo converted into hospitals for the cure of insanity. By far the largest number of recoveries take place within a few months, thus showing the value of early treatment. Dr. Niven places these as high as 90 per cent. within the first year, and, although this appears to me to be over-estimated, there can be no doubt that treatment to be of any real use should be had recourse to as soon as the patient manifests the slightest sign of mental alienation.
6 If we understand, however, the word recovered to signify, as it ought, the total disappearance of the mental disease, the complete return of the former capacity of intellect, of the whole earlier force of character, it must, of course, be but seldom that such a result can be expected. As the ratio of cures decreases with the increase in the number of patients, is it not a question deserving consideration, whether it would not bo more desirable to have an asylum for incurables, reserving the present in- stitutions for recent cases and those susceptible of cure ? The cost of maintenance has been decreased in all the asylums during the past year, and constant attention is bestowed upon the economical working of them. There can be no doubt many persons are consigned to asylums and treated as paupers, whose friends are able to contribute, at least, partly, if not entirely, do their maintenance, and some more strict order appears to be required on this subject. The Deputy Surgeon General, Sindh, mentions the difficulty in making relations contribute towards the support of some of the patients, and suggests that Magistrates should obtain information as to the ability or otherwise of friends to pay. A number of insanes have been treated out of asylums, not including the State of Kolapur, where there is an asylum attached to the civil hospital. The accommodation for these at Dhulia and Nasik answers well enough, but Satara and Sholapur are without any, save in the former, two side rooms belonging to the hospital for females. In the latter, the insanes are treated in a ward of the civil hospital, with the other patients. I much doubt if any reliance can be placed in the number of insanes in the districts furnished by medical subordinates in charge of dispensaries, and in this, I believe, I am borne out by the statement in paragraph 33 of Dr. Wyllie's report, where it is shown that, out of 54 cases, 24 were cured, and the same number absented themselves, probably much improved, if not cured ; 8 were transferred to friends, and only 2 remained under treatment. Probably, most of these, if at all insane, may be accounted harmless idiots. Deputy Surgeon General Maitland objects to the tables, which he thinks complicated and attempting to shew too much, but he has not offered any sug- gestions for improving them ; he also considers there will be difficulty in ob- taining the ago, &c, of insanes. There really ought to be none in obtaining, at least, an approximation to the age, and none to the caste and condition, and thus reliable data would be found, which would do away with Dr. Mait- land's objection, and in his own words, " the tabular statements which appear complicated and attempt to shew too much, when collated and compared with those from other asylums, will, no doubt, afford valuable information. " The tables appended to this roport, hurriedly prepared, are necessarily imperfect, but, it is hoped, Government will receive thorn as a stop made in advance. It is not pretended they approach the most desirable or correct form, and with the view of obtaining the bast and one net of tables for the whole of India, which alone can render the statistics of value, I would suggest such should be supplied by the Sanitary Commission. Then, in time, valuable information regarding insanity in India would be recorded. At
7 the present time, I doubt if we have laid hold of insanity as it really exists among the many millions of people. The conduct of the subordinates and servants generally has been very satisfactory. With these general observations I proceed to remark on, 1st, Europeans in the Kolaba Asylum. 92 Europeans (86 males and 6 females came under treatment during the year, an excess of 37 over 1872-73, when 55 were treated, (53 males and 2 females). Of the 92 insanes 6 remained at the beginning of the year and 86 were admitted during the year. The occupations of the 86 insanes admitted were as follows, as far as could be ascertained:8 TABLE NO.

VII.9 Table No. 2.10 It is remarkable that these intoxicants are so rare as causes of insanity in Poona and Dharwar ; indeed, there appears to be a singular absence of any knowledge of causes in these two asylums. I have no facts to guide me regarding the frequency in this country of marriages of consanguinity, and therefore can only allude to their fatal influence in the production of this and other evils of which there are many examples in the transformation of nervous affections through hereditary influences. The remaining causes of insanity, physical, moral, and predisposing may be accepted, and require no special comment. Of the whole known causes11 Kolaba cannot, as it ought to do, obtain any relief from its always over- crowded state, by sending suitable eases to other asylums for change, as these are almost always full. So far from being able to do this, this asylum is the one to which all cases are sent when other asylums have no accommo- dation. The want of additional asylum space is much to be regretted, as it must have a very serious effect on the health of the insaues at Kolaba, many of whom would be better in the Deccan, where also the cost of them would bo less. Table No. 5.12 Jews are not numerous enough to form a basis of calculation. Other castes : lowest 3, highest 22. Average 11. Average of last five years 13, of first 8. The increase is well marked in the Kolaba, Ahmedabad, and Sindh asylums, whilst in those of Poona and Dharwar, in which the accommodation is of a limited and fixed character, there is no increase. Table No. 7.13 Table No. 8.14 Of caste in relation to marriage, the table gives the following informa- tion :15 I must, however, add in justice to the Superintendent that he has to contend with great difficulties, and that to introduce work of the various kinds indicated would necessitate a larger expenditure than Government are probably at present able to grant. At the same time, it is highly neces- sary that a move should be made in the matter. Table No. 11.16 lunatics had been excluded, instead of being included, in the general calcula- tions, the death-rate of the whole body of lunatics would have been raised to a higher degree.

From the table it will be seen that the main forms of crime were murder 38, homicide not amounting to murder 7, and grievous hurt 6, together 51 in 1872-73 and 47 in 1873-74; being 67.1 and 61.8 per cent., respectively, of the whole number of cases. Murder alone furnished 50 per cent. of the total in 1872-73, and 44.7 per cent. in 1873-74. Theft is a common crime, giving 18.4 per cent. of the total. Crime with violence and theft together furnish 85.5 and 80.2 per cent., respectively, of the whole number of cases tabulated during the past too years. The remaining crimes, under twelve different denominations, are not of importance numerically ; their variety only is noticeable. Table No. XIII.17 Sixteen of the whole number, or 28 per cent., were able to pay for their maintenance, whilst 41 or 72 per cent., were paupers. Poverty gave 15 cases : 7 were cured, 2 died. Fever is a common cause of insanity. There were 29 cases, 8 of which, or 27.6 per cent., were cured ; 4,or 14 per cent., improved ; and 4 died, or 14 per cent. Three were able to pay for maintenance ; 26 not able. Puerperal.18 Table No. XIV.19 The variations in this item of cost as regards natives are considerable, ranging from Rs. 105-9-2 at Kolaba to Rs. 37-1-7 at Ahmedabad. At Kolaba, it will be remembered, there is a medical officer in sole charge ; at all the other asylums the charge is additional to other duties. As to the Mofussil asylums at Poona and Dharwar, there are compara- tively few patients to bear the cost of " establishment," whilst at Ahmed- abad and Haidarabad the charge is distributed over a large number, and so becomes very moderate. The average yearly cost of each patient in relation to diet was20 Table No. XV.21 A hospital is very urgently needed. The increase in bodily ailments, especially fevers, the Superintendent attributes to the asylum being too much shut in. Escapes.22 The asylum is always overcrowded with natives, so that if it could be arranged for the soldiers to be sent direct to the transport from the railway stations, as one set of men was sent during the last season, great relief would be afforded, whilst the regularity in the work of the institution would not be interfered with. The sanitary condition is very far from what it ought to be. This is due to site and want of efficient drainage. The Deputy Surgeon General alludes to the mal-odour which prevails during wet or still and close weather. It is only by constant attention to cleanliness the asylum is kept as healthy as it is. No improvement can take place so long as the present deficient water-supply prevails23 The cost has been considerably diminished as the following table shows. The cost of European superintendence is, and must be, arbitrary, so long as Europeans and natives are mixed in one asylum. Total cost, including buildings, repairs, &c. :24 Out-door employment.25 feeling sure it would, under his supervision, which I know would be cheer- fully given, with the labour of the inmates, be erected at no great cost. The work of grinding grain is evidently the kind of labour best suited to the females, as also that best adapted to the many hopeless cases of criminal lunatics. As might be supposed, the abuse of intoxicating drugs, as ganja, is the cause to which many cases of insanity may be traced, more especially among the poorer classes. Dr. Wyllie is of opinion the abuse of opium alone has not this effect. The arrangement of the asylum is admirable, admitting as it does of extension on the same plan and classification, so much to be desired, not only as regards the malady, but also as it affects caste, as pointed out in the Deputy Surgeon General's report. The system of management is all that could be desired. The Deputy Surgeon General suggests the purchase of a small piece of ground, and the means by which this should be effected. I hope Govern- ment will sanction this, as well as the additional accommodation so much required, that it may, indeed, be considered an absolute necessity. The cost of maintenance has been reduced, and an advantageous contract made, will, it is hoped, enable the Superintendent to show a still further reduction for the current year. I would respectfully invite attention to the remarks regarding patients the subjects of H. H. the Gaekwar, and the system by which they obtain ad- mission into the asylum, no attempt being made to recover the cost of main- tenance which should be arranged for prior to their reception. I am sure His Excellency the Governor in Council will agree with me in opinion that the institution at Ahmedabad, under the able management of Dr. Wyllie, may be considered in every respect a model asylum. I beg to recommend this Officer as most deserving the cordial thanks of Government. HAIDARABAD. Although the site of the asylum is reported to present much that is objectionable, the Superintendent states it is yearly improving, and that he hopes to do away with most of its defects in time, and this by lunatic labour. The limited accommodation brought to notice in the previous report has been supplemented, and though the form of construction is objected to by Dr. Miller, it appears calculated to answer the purpose for which it was intended. There has been an addition of two new wards, which the Superintendent pronounces excellent, and a wall has been constructed which affords privacy to the women's ward, the ground has been levelled, and a bathing-tank and shed built. The building of the wall around the female quarters has been followed by good results, the patients, who before were frightened and trouble- some, having become subdued in demeanour and improved in behaviour. 4 l a
26 It is satisfactory to know this work has been done by the inmates, the bricks being made on the premises, and the little money required being raised by the sale of garden produce. Admissions.27 Average Cost.REPORT BY SURGEON-MAJOR N1VEN, M.D. I have the honour to submit the Annual Report of the Lunatic Asylum for the year 1873-74, together with the detailed statements of expenditure and the statistical tables. Accommodation: su- perficial and cubic space per head. 2. Under the present system of arrangement and management in the asylum, there is sleeping accommodation in the male division for 200 native and 35 European patients. In the female division, where there is no separation of the races, there is accommodation for 50 patients only. In the above estimate, allowance is made for the temporary accommo- dation and safe custody of 30 European soldiers during the cold weather, or what is called the trooping season. With the above numbers, the average superficial area per head is 74 feet for natives and 75 feet for Europeans. In the female division, the superficial area per head amounts to 70 feet only. As the heights of all the rooms and galleries is 10 feet, the cubic space can readily be found by multiplying by 10 : for native males the cubic feet per head will be 740 and for females of all classes it will be only 700 cubic feet. The out-door accommodation is very limited indeed : the whole of the exercising yards and garden together measuring about 7,831 square yards, which give about 30 square yards for each patient. Sanitary condition. 3. The sanitary condition is not very good; heavy and offensive odours pervade the wards and courts night and morning; and when the weather is calm and sultry, this pecu- liarity continues throughout the day, and haunts the numerous corners of the buildings in spite of the most careful use of deodorizing and disinfecting agents. The drainage, like that of the city of Bombay in general, sadly wants extension and improvement. But when it is borne in mind that this small space of ground is surrounded and intersected by high walls, and that all the excreta and washings of upwards of 250 lunatics accumulate daily and nightly within these walls, the wonder is that the institution is so free from disease and death. It can, in my opinion, only be accounted for by the prevalence of high winds which clear the atmosphere, and the periodic rains which wash away all impurities once every year. Water-supply. Except during the monsoon, the supply of water from the pipes of the Vehar Water Company is at all times deficient; and in the months of April and May it ceases altogether, and water has to be brought to the asylum from some considerable distance by means of bullock carts. Of course, this is not a satisfactory state of things, and does not add to the welfare of an institution of this kind, nor in any way diminish the other sanitary defects. 4. On the 31st March 1873 the numbers in the asylum were males 188, females 44 : total 232. 1 L A
2 Admissions, discharges, and deaths. The admissions during the year have been males 170, females 24: total 194. The discharges during the year have been males 141, females 15 : total 156. The discharges include one escape. The deaths during the same period have been males 26, females 7: total 33. The admissions have exceeded the discharges and deaths by 5. Mean population. The mean population of insanes under care and treatment during the year has been males 197.3, females 45.2 : total 242.5. The largest number resident at any one time was 260 in February 1874, and the smallest 232 in April 1873. The numbers in the asylum to-day (31st March 1874) are males 191, females 46 : total 237. The total under care and treatment during the year has, therefore, been males 358, females 68: total 426. These may be classed, in a social point of view, as follows :3 Percentage of recove- ries. 6. Leaving out of the calculation the Europeans who are sent to Eng- land after a very short residence in the asylum, for reasons not connected with the institution, the numerical results of the year yield the following per- centages :4 the whole under care, but in most of the old cases no cause whatever is entered in the register; so that, of those remaining on 31st March 1873, in 50 per cent. of the cases the cause is unknown. I have prepared a table, No. 16, which shows the supposed causes of all the new cases admitted in 1872-73 and 1873-74. According to this table, the chief causes of insanity in the cases admit- ted in 1873-74 were excess in ganja and malarious fever: 33 per cent. of the known causes were from the former, and 20 per cent. from the letter. In Table No. 16 A, the causes amongst Europeans are shown, and about the same proportions are assigned to excess in liquor as to excess in ganja amongst the natives. A blow on the head is the next most frequent cause ; and after this follows exposure to the sun. In the case of the European soldier, the cause given is that entered in the Detailed Medical History by the regimental surgeons. Treatment. 11. No particular kind of treatment is pursued in cases of insanity arising from ganja. The acute stage has generally passed away before the patient reaches the asylum, and all that is required is to see that the man gets plenty of food and is kept clean and quiet. Poverty of blood and malnutrition of the brain appear to be the pathological conditions of such patients, and a good hearty meal with a little stimulant is found to be the best sedative that can be given. The general principles of treatment consist chiefly in the removal of all causes of irritation, mental or bodily. On a patient being brought to the asylum, he or she is placed in a single room for two or three days, well washed, carefully fed, the state and condition of the excretions and secretions examined, and the general character of the disease noted, with any particular, vicious, or other propensities which may be observed. When there is any obvious bodily disorder found to exist, appropriate medicines are prescribed for its removal; but when there is no bodily dis- order present, medicines are not much relied on. In the medical and moral treatment of the patients, the want of means and opportunities for out-door employment is much felt. It has several times been brought to my notice how well all the noisy patients sleep when they are employed for three or four hours in the afternoon, carrying sand or mud for garden or reclamation purposes from the foreshore when there is ebb tide. My firm conviction is that if the asylum had 20 or 30 acres of cultivable land attached to it the cures would be doubled. No mechanical restraint is adopted in the treatment of violent or un- ruly patients. Such patients are placed in one of the dark, boarded cells, or merely shut up for a few hours in an ordinary room, until the excitement subsides. Criminal lunatics. I have no remarks to make on the criminal lunatics, excepting on one who is noted for effecting his escape from jails and once from the asylum. On this man's legs irons are kept with the view of keeping the attention of the warders constantly upon him. He is generally a quiet man, and orderly in his conduct, and occupies him- self with a small garden in the yard.
5 Conditions on which in- sanes are placed in asy- lums, It will not be, I hope, considered out of place here to remark that all the patients are, by law, placed in the asylum under " care and treatment," and not under " treat- ment " only. It is also not unworthy of note that in all Lunatic Asylum Acts, the word " care " comes before " treatment." This is not a mere form of words; there is a deep meaning in it; for it is quite conceivable that a poor lunatic may have too much treatment and too little care bestowed upon him. Prevalence of bodily diseases. 12. The nature of the bodily diseases which prevailed is shown in Table No. 4 ; those most common are fevers and diseases of the stomach and intestine, viz., diarrh6 broad, and is situated in one of the most close and confined corners of the grounds. Without a few acres more ground, and re-modelling and re-con- struction of the whole system of managing and conducting the institution, I do not think any description of systematic labour can be successfully and safely introduced. The proceeds and expenditure of what is called the Working Account and Relief Fund have not been entered in Table No. 14, because it has hitherto been, and is still, carried on at the risk of the superintendent. The value of the domestic labour of the lunatics has been estimated as being equal to seven servants, or Rs. 75 a month; and the conveyance of stores from the Commissariat Department, according to the number of coolies it would have been necessary to hire, at four annas a trip, to bring the same store to the asylum. A separate table, No. 20, is appended to show the amount and sources of income, and the manner of expending the receipts on account of the work- shop. The Europeans are not generally inclined to work at any trade or handi- craft in which they may be skilled ; but even supposing they were inclined to be industrious, it would be most difficult, and not without danger, to em- ploy them in the same shed with natives, as insane people are almost always full of prejudices and conceits, and are possessed of irritable and hasty tem- pers ; so that unless a separate shed were provided, I do not think it would be safe to put mechanical tools into their hands. The Working and Relief Fund Account, however, exhibits a flourishing condition this year, owing to several donations having been received from native Chiefs, who, no doubt, have been led by philanthropic motives and a laudable desire to visit the institution, to gain information regarding their afflicted countrymen, and observe our mode of treating them. Table No. 21 will show the whole details of the quantity and kind of labour as it is at present carried on in the asylum ; and if it is decided in future years that the workshop should be taken over by, and carried on at the risk of, the Government, so that the profits or losses may be brought into the finance of the institution and entered in Statement No. 14, a formal and regular transfer can easily be made. Besides the funds of the Workshop and Relief Fund, the Superintend- ent has in hand sums of money belonging to insane sepoys, whose property is deposited in trust with him, under G. G. O. No. 189 of 10th March 1870. On 31st March 1874, the sepoys' money amounted to Rs. 95-12-0. A few of the native patients are employed regularly in what may be called domestic labour, in and about the establishment; and the paid mason or gowndee has this year, with the assistance of a few docile lunatics, completed a large amount of work in the way of paving back lanes and corners of the grounds, so as to carry off the surface water into the drains. In this way 85 superficial feet of dry rubblestone pitching has been laid down behind the chawl for the warders, valued at Rs. 4 per 100 feet, and 765 superficial of rubblestone and lime pitching behind the cook-house, valued at Rs. 8 per 100 feet. Forty-eight bathing and other tubs have also boon painted by the pa- tients alone, and the value of the work was estimated at Rs. 27. A shed for the fire-engine was found to be much wanted, and an estimate for its erection was procured from the Executive Engineer, amounting to about Rs. 400.
7 This was thought too much, and the Deputy Surgeon-General suggested that the shed should be erected by the lunatics. The materials were, therefore, purchased at a cost of Rs. 59-5-9, and the work commenced; and when it was finished the shed was valued by the Executive Engineer at Rs. 149. A contingent bill for Rs. 59-5-9 was presented to the Accountant General, who refused its payment on the plea that such work should be done by the Public Works Department, although a large sum for contingencies of this sort was entered in the asylum budget. The bill was presented to the Public Works Department, but has not yet been paid, and the amount stands debited to the workshop account in Table No. 21. This little piece of work shows what obstacles exist to carrying on, successfully, systematic and remunera- tive labour, and the need of special rules being made for an institution of this kind. Finance, or cost of care and maintenance of lu- natics. 17. The detailed statement of expenditure and Table No. 14 will show the total cost of care and maintenance of the three dif- ferent classes into which the patients have been divided, in respect to the mode and manner of dieting. Table No. 20 exhibits the source and legal authority for collecting the payments from paying and partial-paying patients. The amount of actual cash received is Rs. 3,587-9-5 for 1873-74 compared with Rs. 2,896-13-0 in 1872-73. The stoppages from soldiers and others should be Rs. 916 for 1873-74, compared with Rs. 304-12-0 for 1872-73. Great care and attention have been bestowed on the management of the dieting of the patients, also in the use of the bedding and clothing, and, what is called in hospital nomenclature, petty supplies, which, indeed, form by far one of the largest items of outlay in the maintenance of the institution. It is in the two items of diet and petty supplies that the expenditure for the year has been most reduced, so as to show a saving in them of Rs. 8,829-10-7 as compared with 1872-73. There is a slight decrease also in the bedding and clothing. The reduction in the cost of diet is Rs. 7,773-13-0, and in petty supplies Rs. 1,055-13-7. In beer and wine and articles obtained from the market a small excess is shown over 1872-73 of Rs. 240-15-1. Increase of pay to certain of the establishment, according to Government Resolution No. 8636, of 24th January 1873, and increased number of extra servants, owing to more European soldiers being received and to added numbers of native insanes, have raised the establishment charges by Rs. 1,100-11-7. It is necessary to bear in mind, while examining the Financial Statement No. 14, that the calculations are based upon the daily average number of diets and not on the medical statistics of the asylum. There is not much differ- ence in the totals, but still there is a difference, and it is caused in this man- ner : one, two, or more patients are admitted on the afternoon, say, of Monday, and are entered in the medical register on that day; but such patients do not come on the diet roll until Wednesday. This mode of estimating the aver- age cost per head appears to me to be more satisfactory, and it is also to some extent rendered necessary on account of the variety of races and castes under care and treatment. Many of the mixed races are quite Europeanized in regard to social and personal habits of life, and it is not unfrequently found expedient, as well as beneficial to their health, to indulge them with Euro- pean society and diet occasionally. If the Europeans and Eurasians were
8 located in entirely separate buildings and grounds, with a distinct staff of overseers, warders, and other servants, as well as a cook-house and appurte- nances all to themselves, it might be possible to define exactly, in every item, the cost of keeping European lunatics in contradistinction to natives ; but as it is, we cannot do so. It would, in my opinion, be much more expensive to have such a separate building and staff than the present plan of a mixed asylum. Of course, a separate asylum for Europeans and East Indians would present many advantages in a medical and social point of view. Taking 242 as the daily average of all the diets, the average cost per head per annum will be Rs. 237-6-11. Dividing into three classes, according to the variety of diets in use, the average cost per head per annum will be for the 1st class, having 14 daily diets, Rs. 405-12-4; for the 2nd class, having 63 daily diets, Rs. 263-0-2 ; for the 3rd class, having 165 daily diets, it will be Rs. 213-6-1. The cost of the diets alone will be Rs. 200-9-1 for the 1st class, Rs. 114-0-2 for the 2nd class, and Rs. 64-6-2 for the 3rd class. The above brings out, as near as possible, the daily cost of the diets to be Re. 0-8-9 for the 1st class, Re. 0-5-0 for the 2nd class, and Re. 0-2-9 for the 3rd class. The 1st class includes Europeans and Eurasians, and the nature of the diet is the same as that supplied in European regimental hospitals; the 2nd class includes Parsees, native Christians of all sorts, mixed races, and a few nondescript people who are fond of changing their character, and wish to be a Christian one day and a native another; the 3rd class consists of Hindus and Mahomedans, and the diet is composed of flour, rice, and dhall, and a small quantity of meat and vegetables ; the diet of the 2nd class contains baker's bread, tea and sugar, milk and meat, as well as rice and dhall. The native Christians and Parsees are very fond of tea, and it would amount almost to an act of cruelty to deprive them of that article of diet. The European superintendence in the first column of Statement No. 14 includes the medical officer's salary, the pay of the two European overseers and matron, and the cost of rations to the three latter, amounting to Rs. 513-12-0. A two-third proportion of this has been allotted to the 1st class and one-third to the 2nd and 3rd classes. The sanctioned subordinate medical establishment consists of one apothecary only and includes the value of his rations, Rs. 171-4-0. The mode of estimating the expenditure of bedding and clothing is based on the actual quantity or number of articles expended during the year and not on the quantity of new clothing received. The quantities entered in the detailed statement for the two years are, therefore, not the quantities of new articles received from the Commissariat Department, but the quantities or number actually expended during the year by fair wear and tear from daily use, i.e., condemned as worn-out and unfit for further use, and struck off the storekeeper's books according to the rules of the asylum. Very little new clothing has been procured during the past two years in con- sequence of an excessively large stock having been, by some oversight, indented for in April 1871. Where it is absolutely necessary, as it is in an asylum, to keep a considerable quantity of clothing in stores, it is necessary, in calculating the expenditure of the institution, to give credit, in some way, for the value of the new clothing in hand at the end of the year ; otherwise
9 the expenditure might appear to rise and fall when it really did not do so. As the cost of the asylum when made from the Accountant General's books will most likely differ from that furnished by my statements, the above remarks will help to explain and elucidate the matter. Medical subordinates, overseers, and warders. 18. The behaviour of the medical subordinates attached to the asylum has been exemplary, and their conduct in the manage- ment of the inmates all that could be desired. The European overseers and native warders have gene- rally performed their duties in a satisfactory manner. Mr. Peter MacDaniel, who had been a good many years employed as an overseer, resigned, and Mr. John Durham was engaged to fill his place. During the short time he has been in the asylum he appears to be well suited for the duties of the situation. 2 L A
10 REPORT BY DEPUTY SURGEON-GENERAL JOHNSTONE, M.D. I have the honour to submit the report of the Superintendent of the Lunatic Asylum, Kolaba, for the year 1873-74. Since 1871-72 the cost of the institution to Government has been considerably decreased. In that year the accounts showed an expenditure of Rs. 1,10,742, including the cost of new buildings, repairs, &c., while in the year 1872-73 the cost was, including the new buildings, repairs, &c., Rs. 99,267. In the year under report the cost was still further reduced, being Rs. 59,683, including cost of new buildings, repairs, &c. In 1871-72 original buildings cost Rs. 19,160; in 1872-73, Rs. 30,230, and in 1873-74, Rs. 1,087, being part of balance of works done in the preceding year. In 1871-72 the diets cost Rs. 40,993, in 1872-73, Rs. 29,073, and in 1873-74, Rs. 20,613, according to the Superintendent's figures, showing a saving on diets of Rs. 19,695 during this period, notwithstanding an increase in the number of lunatics. The Superintendent has shown the cost of each diet; and every attention will continue to be paid to such economy in this and other respects as is compatible with the welfare of the persons entrust- ed to the asylum for care and treatment. 2. In last year's report the Superintendent of the Asylum stated that "it would appear to be settled thus, that the military authorities have a permanent claim for 20 beds for European soldiers. It will be important to bear this in mind, as .I have no doubt that the asylum will be quite full in two or three years." This number has in the last year been increased to 30, on the authority of the Superintendent. The need for this accommodation causes, I think, a waste of the space provided in the new wing, as that for these thirty must, to a great extent, be unoccupied during several months of the year; unless, indeed, as appears now not unlikely, European insane inhabitants increase, not from increase of in- sanity, but from difficulty in sending them to their own countries; in which case the soldier insanes, if numerous, will not find the necessary accommoda- tion. Under present circumstances, from about April to the early part of November, a considerable part of the wing is, to all intents and purposes, unoccupied. 3. The admission of European soldiers, en route to the west, interferes with the regularity of the institution, and some confusion is created. A European guard is necessary in the grounds. Would it not be better that these men should be kept at Deolalee until the period of the departure of the troopships, and be at once transferred to them ? The objection to this is that there is no establishment at Deolalee where any number of insanes could be kept and taken care of for a time; the advantages would be the immediate increase of space in the asylum for its legitimate purpose, which has been, perhaps, lost sight of in arranging for requirements of the soldier insanes, who are simply temporary lodgers on their way to England. One set last year, however, did pass directly from Deolalee to the troopship.
11 4. The sanitary condition of the asylum is portrayed in somewhat gloomy colours; wherever a number of lunatics may be located, under similar conditions and circumstances as attend this asylum, it must necessarily be that excreta and washings must accumulate during the night; these are, however, quickly removed at early morning, and are not allowed to collect to any great extent during the day. In wet weather, that is, when rain falls without wind, and occasionally when the atmosphere is still and close, there is undoubtedly a malodour, which is, however, kept down by free use of deodorants, by sluicing when possible, and disappears when the breeze sets strongly in, almost entirely. 5. The asylum, built at a time when sanitary laws were yet in their infancy, does not possess such special contrivances as exists in European asylums of the present day, with plentiful water-supply and full-fall drains, by. which prompt removal without assistance is effected. It is a matter of doubt whether such arrangements could now be carried out satisfactorily in the buildings. 6. The Superintendent has dwelt on the paucity of water ; there is at certain seasons barely sufficient to meet the domestic wants, none to sluice the drains, which are at certain seasons offensive, and for gardening purposes. Under any circumstances, the water-supply should, I respectfully suggest, engage the attention of Government, particularly when the necessity is before us of endeavoring to purify by its means, as far as possible, the atmosphere of the premises. 7. Concerning criminal lunatics, the Superintendent alludes to the Prussian Code. Presumably what is meant is, that before a criminal is pronounced lunatic, the statutory condition to be fulfilled is that the evidence of insanity taken at the trial has to be placed before an expert, whose opinion has, to a certain extent, to guide the Judge in his decision. Perhaps, were this system carried out here, some criminals would not be sent to lunatic asylums as insane. 8. The mortality is said to be influenced by the rainy season, and, con- sequently, the health of the inmates must be also. This may be ascribed to exposure, as the sheds in the yards are insufficient for proper shelter during the rains as well as in the other seasons, and to there being no hospital for the treatment of bodily disease, the sick being treated either in the dormi- tories, or in an exposed shed at the south extremity of the asylum, quite un- suited for such a purpose. But this, with other wants, must probably remain unremedied, until a new asylum, designed on principles at present recognized as correct, can be built on another site, where space can be afforded for every purpose required for the care and treatment of lunatics. 9. There is much difficulty in finding employment for the lunatics, particularly with reference to remunerative industry. At present the busi- ness is carried on, on account of the workshop, by the Superintendent, as it has been for a number of years. Originally, money was laid out by the Superintendent himself for the purchase of materials; these, when worked up into baskets, chairs, &c., were sold, and the proceeds employed in reimbursing the Superintendent for his outlay in re-purchase of materials, in relief to
12 poor discharged insanes, and in adding to their comforts in the asylum. By small benefactions, &c., this fund has been kept up to the present time. It would be, perhaps, better if the whole should be made over to the Accountant General, who might be authorized to grant a certain sum, under the sanction of the Deputy Surgeon-General, for the working fund only ; and that small gratuities, sanctioned at each period of discharge, should be allowed to poor insanes to enable them to pass to their villages with less risk. 10. Such charges might be sanctioned under the Budget grant, a regular account of the work, &c., being kept and submitted. Frequent visits to the asylum enable me to report that much attention is paid to the care of the insane by the Superintendent and his establishment.
13 REPORT BY DEPUTY SURGEON-GENERAL JOHNSTONE, M.D., ON INSANES OUT OF ASYLUMS. I have the honour to submit a table, No. 15, giving such information as has been available, concerning the lunatics who have been brought to civil surgeons, or to dispensaries in the Presidency Division, during the years 1872-73 and 1873-74, from district magistrates, police, and jails, or by friends. From the recent census I have caused the numbers of insane and idiots to be tabulated, and my return will show what a small percentage of these has required to be removed to an asylum, or has appeared for any treatment. 2. The greater number sent to civil surgeons are so for observation, and some of these are, on the declaration of the medical officer, sent to the lunatic asylum at Kolaba, to that of Ahmedabad from Surat, and to Dharwar from Kanara. Recently, some criminal lunatics have been sent from the Kanara Collectorate to Kolaba. 3. At the Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital insane patients have been treated, the insanity appearing whilst under treatment for other diseases. In 1872-73 there were 22 cases, out of which number 2 were cured, 10 sent to the lunatic asylum at Kolaba, and 10 consigned to relatives. In 1873-74 there were 29 cases, of which 7 were improved or cured, 11 sent to the asylum, and 11 consigned to relatives, &c. 4. In the European General Hospital, in 1872-73, 3 lunatics were treated, 1 was cured, and 2 sent to the asylum. In 1873-74 there was only 1 treated, the case was discharged cured. 5. In the Tanna Civil Hospital, in 1872-73,4 cases were either treated or sent for observation ; 1 of these was sent to the asylum, and 3 to friends, unimproved. In 1873-74 there were 8 cases, 1 of which was sent to the asylum, the remainder were given over to their friends, unimproved. 6. In the Surat Civil Hospital, 14 cases were either sent to the civil hospital for treatment or observation in 1872-73, chiefly for the latter ; most of these were, it is believed, sent to the lunatic asylum at Ahmedabad, 1 died in hospital. In 1873-74, 7 cases were received into hospital, 2 sent to the Ahmedabad Asylum, 5 were entrusted to the care of their friends or relatives, and 1 died. 7. At the Broach Civil Hospital, 5 cases were brought to notice in 1872-73 ; some of these were transferred to the lunatic asylum at Ahmed- abad. In 1873-74,12 cases were sent to hospital, 4 of which were transferred to the same asylum. 8. At Ratnagiri 1 case occurred in 1872-73, which was transferred to a lunatic asylum. In 1873-74 no cases were brought to notice. At Vengurla, in 1872-73, 5 cases were sent to the medical officer, 2 of these were transferred to the lunatic asylum, 3 were entrusted to their friends, 2 apparently cured, and 1 very much improved. In 1873-74 there was only one case which was transferred to relatives much improved.
14 9. At Dapuli only one case occurred in 1872-73, which was transferred to the asylum at Kolaba. In 1873-74 no case was sent to the medical officer. 10. Karwar Civil Hospital received 7 cases in 1872-73, one of which, according to the register, was transferred to an asylum. In 1873-74 there were 9 lunatics, 4 of whom were transferred to the Dharwar Asylum, 1 died, and 4 were given to the care of their relatives, &c. 11. At Alibagh, in 1872-73, 3 cases were sent to the medical officer; all were sent to the asylum. In 1873-74, 5 cases were sent to the medical officer for observation, and of which 3 were sent to the asylum at Sawantwari. None were sent for observation or treatment. 12. At Aden, in 1872-73, 2 cases were treated and subsequently transferred to friends, &c. In 1873-74 there were 3 cases, of which 1 was cured, 1 not improved, sent to friends, and 1 died. 13. The causes of the mental disease are chiefly stated to be "unknown." In each year 1 is put down as hereditary, 4 and 6, respectively, to ganja, or intoxicating drinks, 7 and 12, respectively, to diseases, acci- dents, masturbation, &c., 52, and 44 to causes unknown. Endeavours will be made to ascertain more closely the probable causes which lead to the mental disease in those brought up for observation or treatment. 14. At dispensaries a total number in 1872-73 of 50, and in 1873-74 of 42, lunatics have attended ; in general their friends bring them, but they soon cease to attend, and are then marked absented. At some dispensaries, such as Surat Civil, Bassein, Kumpte, &c., more than usual numbers appeared. In 1872-73, 12 were stated to be cured15 REPORT ON THE POONA LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1873-74. To endeavour to meet the requirements of the Surgeon-General's cir- cular of the 8th instant, No. 1397, of 1874, I have had the set of forms received with it filled in, which I now forward. 2. I cannot, from personal observation, speak to most of the events of the last year, having been in charge of the asylum only for a few months at the end of it; but from information derived from the records, added to my previous acquaintance with the institution, I am enabled to offer the follow- ing remarks. 3. The establishment of a lunatic asylum at Poona appears to have taken place about fifty years ago, and a sketch of the history of the institu- tion from that time (1823) until its separation from the civil hospital, on incorporation of the latter with the Sassoon Hospital in 1867, will be found in my report on the subject, No. 330, dated 16th November 1867. 4. A later special report, to which I would request more particular attention, was forwarded on the 15th February 1869, describing the accom- modation afforded by the asylum, and detailing measures considered necessary for its improvement and enlargement, most of which are still applicable to existing circumstances, though a few unimportant modifications might be required to suit changes that have taken place in the last five years. 5. The resolution of Government on the medical administration of the presidency in 1872-73, declares the working of the institution to have been unsatisfactory; and thus throws the onus of improving it on the Medical Department, which in return may fairly expect that reasonable assistance and means towards effecting the object will be afforded, that a new asylum will be either realized or abandoned, and if the latter, that the old one will be remodelled and so constructed as to afford the commonest and most evident requirements of a medical institution for treatment of the different classes of mental diseases, which, at present, it is utterly devoid of. General results of practice. 6. The general results of practice in the asylum for the year, taken from the returns forwarded, may be thus stated :16 Forms of insanity. 9. Of the 72 cases treated, 65 are returned as mania, 2 mania compli- cated with epilepsy, 3 monomania, 1 melan- cholia, and 1 amentia. Causes. Intoxicating drugs. 10. Of the direct or predisposing causes leading to insanity but little can be learned after patients reach the asylum ; and as the subject is one of much interest and practical importance, it is hoped that district, magisterial, and medical officers, will be requested in future, before removing insane patients to a dis- tance from their homes and from those acquainted with their antecedents, to obtain, as far as possible, a full history of the case and circumstances which evidently or probably have induced, or tended to the development of the mental disease, such statement being in every case forwarded with the magistrate's application for admission of the patient into the asylum. Of exciting, or intoxicating, indulgences the most prolific in producing insanity are ganja-smoking, bhang-drinking; and to the habitual use of these stimulants by men, the large excess of male over female lunatics, as well as the greater prevalence of crime, and also of the maniacal type of mental disease, were attributed by Dr. Beatty in his annual reports for the last two years. Disproportion of sexes. 11. As regards the disproportion of sexes, I do not think this entirely holds good, for we have nearly as great a dis- crepancy in general practice in the civil hos- pital, not because women possess any especial immunity from disease, but because, from the custom of the country, they keep more within their own houses, and are generally reluctant to seek in-door hospital relief ; so with those afflicted with mental disease, unless either very poor or very trouble- some, their friends seldom seek to have them removed to a lunatic asylum, but try to manage them quietly at home. Expenditure. Charge for clothing, &c. 12. The total expenditure17 Employment. 14. The want of employment has been a fruitful theme of complaint in almost every annual report on the asylum, and now, at the end of fifty years, we seem to have fallen off rather than advanced in this respect; for, in my report in November 1870, No. 126, on this point, I find it stated in paragraph 2 : ''Of the male patients a nominal roll shows that 25, or 50 per cent. of the whole, do light or occasional work in the garden of the asylum or of the Sassoon Hos- pital, which is close by." This state of things continued till I left for England a few months after. But on resuming charge of the asylum, after a lapse of three years from the date of the report quoted, I find the number who go out reduced to 6, which, allowing the number of male inmates to stand at 48 as before, would only give 12.5 per cent. employed instead of 50. The only reasons assigned for the falling off are either that the warders neglected their work, or were taken for other work; and in the way of remedying this, some little improvement may be now effected. But until we have properly enclosed exercise and garden grounds, any attempt to employ the inmates of an asy- lum regularly, and so as to benefit both their bodily and mental health, must be very imperfect, if not open to practical objection, when we consider the extremely exposed and public situation of the asylum and Sassoon Hospital compounds. Description of labour best suited to classes from which patients are received. 15. That garden or field labour is about the only occupation generally suited for native lunatics is admitted ; and this can be better understood if we examine the register roll of patients, showing the classes from which our inmates are drawn. For of the 47 males remaining on 31st March, 19 were cultivators or farm labourers, 15 were beggars, many of whom are coolies, 7 were sepoys, sowars, peons, lascars, &c., 1 barber, 1 tailor, 1 weaver, 1 shopkeeper, 1 house-servant, 1 unknown ; of the females, 4 were labourers, 3 beggars, and 3 unknown ; showing what a very small proportion of skilled labour is ordinarily available among patients received from these districts. Increase or decrease of lunacy. 16. There remain now but a few more of the points on which informa- tion was directed to be given, to be touched upon. First, as to the increase or decrease of lunacy, we have no sufficient data to guide us in pronouncing an opinion, for the accommodation afforded having generally been inadequate to receive the number of patients seeking to be admitted, the fullness of the asylum, whether complete or approximate, is an insufficient test of the increase or diminution of mental disease in these districts. General hygiene. 17. The points indicated in paragraphs 2, 3, and 4, have been already commented on, or are explained by the tables sent. On the fifth or general hygiene of the asylum, the special report, already referred to, will afford information and give a description of the kind of accommodation afforded. The amount calculated, as allowed for each patient, is in the male ward 1,200 cubic feet, female ward 1,100 cubic feet. Means of restraint. 18. The only means of restraint used are padded cells; but with native patien ts it is not often necessary to have re- course to restraint. Refusing food is more common with them ; but in the last year there does not seem to have been any instances of this in the asylum.
18 Criminal lunatics. 19. As it has been decided by Government that the criminal lunatics now at Poona shall be transferred to Kolaba, and as their crimes have been specified as directed in the tabular form forwarded, and separate special reports on the present state of each furnished, when required in the Judicial Department, it does not seem necessary to enter into further details regarding them in this report. Lunatics out of asylums. 20. Regarding lunatics out of asylums, district magistrates, civil surgeons, and village authorities, or dispensary subordinates, might be requested to report. In the asylum, only cases sent for observation could be so returned, and with this view an accurate register of such cases has been kept from the commencement of the current year. Former Superintendent's state- ment. 21. In compliance with the regulations of the Service (Rule 67, Section IV.) a copy of portion of the statement left by the last superintendent is here transcribed, the earlier part being omitted, as it refers only to numbers treated and results which have now been embodied in the returns rendered for the whole year. Dr. Beatty states19 Latrine accommodation for servants. 23. The absence of any latrine accommodation for the servants of the asylum and of the Sassoon Hospital, residing on the premises, and their families, in all about 78 persons, and the consequent filthy and unwholesome state of the compound were reported, and the sanction of Govern- ment obtained for the outlay required for opening doors into and making available for use one of the old hospital latrines, which has since been done. Bathing-place for females. 24. The bathing-place adjoining the covered shed, alluded to in Dr. Beatty's report,has been completed in the female part of the asylum, but something of the same kind, but larger, for the males is very much needed. Proposal for procuring diets by contract negatived. 25. The probable result of the proposal for dieting the lunatic patients by contract, instead of through the Commis- sariat Department, was fully reported on in my letter of 19th December 1873, No. 108, and Government, in their resolution on the subject, have decided that Dr. Beatty must have written under misapprehension. Water-suply desired. Saving proposed. 26. The desirability of supplying the asylum with Kuruckwasla water from a stand-pipe on the premises, from which the patients could obtain and distribute water for their own use, and so save fifteen rupees a month, now paid to a bheesty, has been laid before the visitors, and submitted through the Irrigation Department to Govern- ment for approval and sanction. Question of improving old asylum. 27. In conclusion, I may beg to offer as a suggestion worth consideration the query: Whether the present asylum and grounds, if somewhat altered and added to, pro- perly enclosed and provided with an abundant supply of good water, might not for an outlay, which would be a fraction of what an entirely new site and buildings will cost, be made to afford accommo- dation with seclusion, separation, and occupation for 100 native patients? which, as the site is not inimical to the health of such inmates as the insti- tution ordinarily receives, are about all the chief requisites for a local or district asylum for natives of Poona and the adjoining collectorates.
20 ANNUAL MEDICAL REPORT OF THE LUNATIC ASYLUM, DHARWAR, FOR THE YEAR CLOSING MARCH 31ST, 1874. During the past year there have been admitted 6 patients : 4 dementia and 2 mania ; the deaths amounting to 4, divisible into : 1 from fever, 2 diarrh21 REPORT BY DEPUTY SURGEON-GENERAL MAITLAND ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS OF POONA AND DHARWAR. The aggregate number of patients remaining in the Poona and Dhar- war Asylums at the commencement of the official year was 85, fresh ad- missions 17; making a total of 102 insanes treated during the year. Of these, 8 were discharged cured, re-admitted none, transferred 3, died 10; leaving under treatment, on the 31st March, 67 males and 14 females. To each report submitted by superintendents of asylums is attached 14 tabular statements, which, when collated and compared with statements from other asylums, will no doubt afford valuable information. At present some of the forms appear complicated, and, I think, attempt to show too much from too great sub-division of small numbers. The results obtained from forms 8 and 10, showing the age, caste, and condition of life of lunatics, would be useful, had the statements been based on reliable data, which can hardly be expected when we consider how little really is known of each in- dividual's case. For it has been long a subject of complaint, that lunatics, as a rule, are sent to asylums with blank history sheets ; and instances are even recorded in which their names were unknown. In support of this state- ment, I need only allude to the fact that, out of a total of 105 patients treated during the year, 94, or 92 per cent., are labouring under forms of insanity, the causes of which the medical officers are ignorant of. As, however, Government have issued stringent orders on this subject and expect that hereafter no lunatic will be forwarded to an asylum, without, as far as practicable, every information regarding his previous his- tory and present state being ascertained and made known to the superin- tendent, the mass of information these statements are intended to supply will in time be full and complete. The above remarks, of course, do not apply to criminal lunatics, whose antecedents are generally only too well known ; but, unfortunately, not until they appear at the bar of justice, accused of perpetrating some grievous assault or cruel murder. POONA ASYLUM. Since last report the alterations and additions therein recommended have been carried out. The long south ward has been divided into two, and a small adjoining building converted into two safe and comfortable padded rooms for refractory patients. A bathing-shed has also been put up for the use of the females ; which last convenience, I think, might also be erected on a larger scale in the male compound. Additional accommodation in the asylum is still urgently needed for male lunatics, especially for progressing and convalescent patients, and it is with this object that the superintendent has submitted to Government, through the visitors of the asylum, a proposal to convert one of the wards of the old civil hospital, now used as an office by the assistant collector, into a convalescent ward, and in this way raise the number of sick to 74. As Government see no probability, at present, of a general lunatic asylum being built at Poona, I strongly recommend that Dr. Lord's sugges- tions be carried out, so soon as office-room can be found for the collector.
22 Indeed, every portion of the old civil hospital promises might now, I think, be repaired and made available for the accommodation of insanes. At the same time, I cannot concur in Dr. Lord's views that the present asylum and ground, if altered and put into a proper state of repair, would do away with the necessity of building another asylum. In the first place, the present site does not afford that seclusion so ecessary in the treatment of lunatics, and in the next, there is no ground around it available for garden purposes23 by superintendents, should the suggestion meet with the approval of the Surgeon-General. At my visits to the asylum I have had every reason to be satisfied that, as far as practicable, and the present arrangements of the ward will admit of, everything is done to ensure order and cleanliness, and to provide for the comfort and well-being of the insanes; and no medical officer, I feel sure, is more keenly alive to the disadvantage under which the duties of the asylum are carried on, or more zealous and anxious to ameliorate the condition of its inmates, than is Dr. Lord, its present superintendent. DHARWAR LUNATIC ASYLUM. As the prospect of any enlargement being made to this asylum is dependent on the removal of the civil hospital to a position nearer the town, some few years must yet be allowed to pass over before the institution is able to meet the pressing calls made upon it. In this asylum, 30 lunatics have been treated during the year: 6 of these were fresh admissions, 4 have died, or 13.3 of deaths to strength, 2 transferred to their friends, leaving 24 patients under treatment. There is no room available in which the sick insanes can be treated, as obtains at Poona, nor is a hospital required at present for the few sick, who can be very properly attended to in the night-room, or separate cells, on which principle this asylum is built. At present there is only one criminal lunatic in the asylum, and he will shortly, I trust, be sent to Bombay, together with those at Poona; for no proper accommodation exists for that class of insanes in either of the asylums in this division. The superintendent states that the only alterations to this asylum, since the former report, is the conversion of two cells into padded rooms for refractory patients. The garden in which the insanes are employed, the superintendent like- wise states, is productive, and supplies a fair quantity of vegetables daily to the prisoners; and he considers that this kind of employment is, as a remedial or palliative agent, most beneficial to the lunatics. The crowded state of the asylum, to which Dr. Mackenzie alludes, I am afraid cannot be remedied until the civil hospital is removed elsewhere. On my inspection in January last, I was favourably impressed with the cleanliness, order, and good arrangement, for the comfort of the insanes, which everywhere existed in this asylum, and which reflects credit on the superintendent.
24 REPORT ON LUNATICS TREATED IN CIVIL, POLICE, AND JAIL HOSPITALS DURING THE YEAR 1873-74 There remained in the civil hospitals at the close of the year 1873-74 21 lunatic patients, since admitted 72, making a total of 95 insanes; 25 of these were discharged cured, 16 transferred to Kolaba Asylum, 27 to friends, and 4 have died, leaving 21 still under treatment in the hospitals. At the asylum attached to the civil hospital at Kolhapur, the largest number of patients have been treated, and still remain under treatment. The asylum is built after the plan of the one at Dharwar, at the expense of the Kolhapur State, and has already proved a most necessary and valuable addition to the civil hospital. The accommodation assigned to the lunatic patients at the Dhulia Civil Hospital answers well enough, but an additional force is required to assist in keeping in order the excitable and more refractory insanes. Eight lunatics still remain under treatment. At Satara nothing has been done to provide proper accommodation for insanes. They are still kept in two side rooms belonging to the female hospital, which is a separate building and surrounded by a wall, an ar- rangement which certainly ensures the safe custody of the lunatics, but one which is very detrimental to the comfort and welfare of the female patients. In view to remedy this evil, it is now proposed to convert a small detached building, situated at the western entrance of the compound, and at present used as a storeroom, into small lunatic wards, capable of hold- ing four patients; and I have directed the civil surgeon to obtain from the executive engineer a plan and estimate of the alterations and additions required. The Civil Hospital at Nasik is a very large old building, and quite capable of affording room for the insanes sent to it for treatment. Seven patients have passed through the hospital during the year ; 3 were discharged cured, 1 transferred to Colaba, and 3 to friends. The Sholapur Civil Hospital affords no accommodation whatever for lunatics. During the year only 5 insanes have been admitted, and were treated in the civil ward with other patients. Of these, 1 was discharged cured, 3 were transferred to Kolaba, 1 remained. A separate ward is here also much needed in which this class of patients might be properly cared for and treated. Lunatics when admitted to the Civil Hospital, Dharwar, are either transferred to the local or to the parent asylum at Kolaba; but in slight cases they are kept under observation and treatment in the civil hospital, and, when cured, discharged.
25 The table annexed to this report will show the number of lunatics treated in each hospital, and the manner in which each patient has been disposed of. POLICE HOSPITAL. Only two cases of insanity have been admitted to police hospitals during the year. One occurred at Dharwar, and the man, after remaining in hospital for a short time, was discharged cured; the other at the Sassoon Hospital. He likewise was discharged cured. Insanes treated at civil and charitable dispensaries have been as follows :26 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE AHMEDABAD LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1873-74. Introductory. The asylum was constructed in 1862, and originally designed to accom- modate an aggregate of 70 inmates, the highest daily number of insanes up to that time being only 45. In 1869, however, it was necessary to enlarge it to meet pressing wants ; and a further addition was made in 1872. Thus extended, it is equal to the recep- tion of 108 patients, a number now exceeded; and hence it has again become necessary for some months past to decline fresh admissions. This fact has a significancy that should now be recognized, inasmuch as it cannot be supposed that the present pressure on space is merely temporary. On the contrary, the history of the asylum, as expressed by its development within the past ten years, sufficiently indicates that the want of accommodation, now noticed, promises soon to be urgently felt as a permanent requirement. It therefore appears expedient that this matter should have early consideration, so that timely provision may be made to meet the cost of additional buildings. Number treated. 2. The number of insanes under treatment for the year was much larger than before, amounting to an aggregate of 142, of whom 108 were remaining at the date of last report, and 34 were fresh admissions. Of the total, 16 were discharged cured, 9 were transferred to friends, 8 died, and 109 now remain. Compared with the previous year, these figures show an increase of 10 in the total, of 12 in the daily strength, of 5 in the deaths, and of 1 in the remaining; while there is a decrease of 1 in the cures as below exhibited :27 and thus seriously affecting their value as statistics, it is sufficient to pass the matter with this notice. Of the aggregate, twenty were criminals. Classes treated. 4. Classed socially 131 were paupers, and, as such, maintained solely at the charge of Government. Native States met the expenses in four instances, while only in 11 cases were friends in a position to defray the costs of maintenance or contribute therete. The disparity thus expressed might probably suggest that the well-to-do stood aloof from the asylum. But this certainly is not the case. The true explanation lies in the fact that insanity is less common under conditions of competency, and is more particularly the disease of poverty and its demoraliz- ing influences and surroundings. 5. Classed by caste,. 118 were Hindoos, 23 Mussulmans, and 1 Parsee ; and, as far as can be known, 94 belonged to Guzerat, 23 to Upper India, the remainder being chiefly from Marwar, the Deccan, Kattywar, the Punjab, and Afghanistan. Of the total, 110 were British subjects. Number admitted. Forms of Diseases. Males. Females. Total. Amentia ... ... ... 5 1 6 Mania acuta ... ... ... 12 ... 12 28 cures, calculated on mean daily population, was equal to 15.1, a figure that compares favourably with kindred institutions, being nearly double that of the Hanwell Asylum. Excepting the instance of a criminal whohad been 9 years an inmate (but perfectly sane since 1867), the cures were all effected in cases that had been less than two years under treatment. The longest period was one year and nine months, the least two months, the majority being under one year. In every instance convalescence was gradual, and, in general, slow, sometimes not without partial relapse; the interval from the first indications of dawning improvement to the full restoration of reason ranging from 7 weeks to 15 months. It was noticeable, as before, that cure was most rapidly accomplished in cases traceable to the abuse of ganja. Number transferred. 8. The intervention of friends is necessarily a disturbing element in estimating success. During the year nine patients were thus removed (as authorized by Sections IV. and X. of Act XXXVI. of 1858), the reasons assigned being generally of a domestic nature. The number was about the ordinary average entered under this head, although double that of the previous year. In four of these cases treatment had extended from 1 to 4 years without appreciable benefit ; they are thus doubtless to be estimated in the category of incurables. But in three treated, for periods: of 4, 5, and 15 months, the condition had so greatly improved, that eventual recovery was merely a question of a few weeks at most; while in the remaining two instances, the patients had been too short a time in the asylum to admit of a judgment being formed respecting them. Deaths. 9. There were eight deaths during the year, giving a ratio of 7.5 per cent. to daily population, and, therefore, a proportion considerably below the average, both here and elsewhere. Two of these happened from Bright's disease in patients who had been, respectively, two and seven years in the asylum; and in the former, the condition was recognized on admission. One occurred from diarrh29 Total remaining. Forms of Diseases. Males. Females. Total.

This occupation, which they engage in very readily and invariably discharge carefully, singing blithely at their task, has proved most beneficial in averting impending pa- roxysms of excitement ; while it has, moreover, the very great advantage of recalling home associations and awakening feelings and influences that for the time speak for them. The women now prepare all the grain required for the asylum, and when thus busily employed, one has sometimes a difficulty in realizing that they are in reality demented. Criminal insanes.

As witnessed here, ignorance, poverty, dissipation, and vice, or, in other words, " the forces adverse to civilization," are doubtless the most prominent agents in its production. Testimony from first sources, or reliable information, indeed, of any kind is, however, very rarely obtainable. Certificates are seldom other- wise than silent, and friends, even when forthcoming, reticent, contradictory, or ignorant. Thus conclusions have generally to be based on observation of habits, associations, and avowed addictions, as disclosed while under treatment. Nevertheless, a very considerable number, embracing more particularly the admissions from amentia and dementia, must needs remain conjectural. It is, however, unquestionable that the abuse of ganja is a fruitful factor in the production of insanity, especially among the vagrant mendicant classes of aboriginal blood, an addiction to the drug being seemingly a tolerably common proclivity in vagabond life. There are at this date some 24 patients whose condition is traceable to this cause, and it is ordinarily a notable feature in acute cases of such origin that the hallucinations are of the wildest and most extravagant. On no occasion has either opium, tobacco, bhang, liquor, or venery, individually appeared as causes, but collectively they doubtless ac- count for a number of the cases, and there are at least 13 that have no other history. These have, accordingly, been included in Statements Nos. 3 and 14, under the general head of debauchery. Other causes, such as religious enthusiasm, unsuccessful litigation, commercial vicissitudes, and unhappy do- mestic relations have also each their representative victims, as unmistakeably betrayed by their prevailing hallucinations. Emotional influences, however, are seldom encountered as a cause, except in the educated. Management. 16. No change has been made under this head during the year, and as the mode of management has been frequently detail- ed in former reports, a brief allusion will now be suf- ficient. Its primary aim is to diffuse, as far as practicable, a spirit of cheerful contentment as the most rational basis of cure ; to afford the inmates at all times the protection and assistance of humane and intelligent supervision and care ; to keep constantly before them the example of such wholesome influences as obedience, regularity, forbearance, mutual assistance, diligence, and industry, in view to awakening interests and creating confidence; and, above all, to seek to improve the physical health, and engage the attention by exercise and employment in the open air, in regard of the intimate relations existing between mind and body. Discipline and order are successfully maintained under a homely system of kindness, blended with firmness, as occasion may demand; and, as a rule, the asylum is ordinarily as quiet and orderly as a well-regulated household. No mechanical means of restraint have been used for many years, nor is there any padded room ; conciliation of demeanour, with patient and forbearing attention, having generally been found to be far more efficacious in dealing with the refractory than the em- ployment of coercive measures. And thus temporary seclusion, with or without the exhibition of sedatives, has been all that has been necessary even in exceptional cases throughout the year. Amusements. 17. The patients are, at all times, encouraged to take an interest in the work of the garden, and engage actively in its cultivation, alike as a healthful recreation and as as preservative against excitement. For in-door amusements, in the intervals of employment, games, music, and vernacular newspapers are provided. Con- valescents, occasionally, receive some little elementary instruction, while a
32 trusted few of this class occupy themselves with duties in the service of the asylum. A half-holiday is granted every week to the more intelligent of the industrious and well-conducted, who are then permitted, under suitable supervision, to visit the city market, provided with a few pice to spend on harmless gratification. This indulgence, at once an element of discipline and a gradual re-introduction to the world, is greatly prized, and although now continued for many years, on no occasion has the behaviour of those so privileged, while out of doors, been otherwise than fully satisfactory. 18. There is nothing new to note of medical agents. Hydrate of chloral continues to be occasionally employed in exceptional cases of excitement and pervigilium; and is a useful addition to the available means of controlling insomnia, among which large poultices, containing a fifth part of mustard, applied for several hours over the stomach, are the most generally used. But remedies of this class are comparatively seldom resorted to, since, save in exceptional instances, a comfortable meal will ordinarily be found the best se- dative, and abundance of exercise and labour in the open air the best hypnotic. Bromide of potassium has had a more extended trial than before, and with decided good results, particularly in some of the cases complicated with epi- lepsy. In one of these recovery followed, and in two others, transferred to friends, both were materially improved, the epileptic seizures having long ceased. Employment. 19. Gardening still continues, as I trust it long may, to be the chief pursuit followed by the males, the hours usually being from early morning till 9 or 10, and from 3 till sunset. Many of them eagerly engage in it, disdaining often the interval of rest, and conduct skilfully, in silent pre-occupation, all the operations con- nected with the irrigation and culture of a large flourishing garden. Employ- ment in this direction has the rare merit that it can be entered on by all without detriment to creed, or prejudice to caste, while it is, at the same time, highly conducive to physical health, a consideration of the last importance in the successful treatment of the insane. No form of employment, as experience amply shows, can vie with this peaceful, pleasurable pursuit in awakening interest and engaging attention, while its soothing salutary influences, whether under morbid conditions of depression or excitement, are abundantly verified in the results of daily bservation. 20. It is, however, very rarely that patients on reception are in a condi- tion to enter on this occupation, or, indeed, to engage in any other. An interval of retirement or seclusion, devoted to special treatment, is almost invariably required, and then the beginnings are generally of a merely mechanical kind, often, at first, reluctantly or perfunctorily performed, such as carrying materials for levelling the ground or repairing the pathways. Even such employment, although of necessity frequently failing in effecting the result aimed at, is, nevertheless, under all circumstances, still, in the interests of the individual and of the other inmates, conducive as it is to tranquillity by day and rest at night, while it occasionally succeeds in restoring the lost balance between physical and mental health, even under conditions seemingly hopeless. 21. This only illustrates a truth long recognized and observed here, viz., that employment of any kind is infinitely preferable to idleness; occupa- tion of some sort, but particularly out of doors, being an unquestionable necessity in the successful treatment of the insane.
33 22. Grain-grinding has been above referred to as the work of the women, and also that of the criminal males. In respect of the latter, results are still to be awaited in its comparatively recent introduction, as well as the very unfavourable character of the cases. But already, as remarked, it has certainly promoted health, order, and good behaviour, and I anticipate more. With the women its success has been most encouraging, as evidenced by the increasing cures, alike as in the fact that disorder and discord have now in their case given place to tranquillity and contentment, and thus, even in the worst, there has been a moral and material gain. 23. I would be glad to have an opportunity of further extending this form of employment, suitable as it is for those whose sex or circumstances disqualify them for out-door work, if that could possibly be done without injury to other interests. 24. Brick-making was pursued up to May, when the advance of season, as well as the then approaching completion of the new well, put an end to it; and it has not been resumed as anticipated, owing to there being no funds forthcoming for the extension of the out-buildings34 The above figures, while larger than heretofore, are not to be estimated on grounds of financial consideration alone. The prime purpose of work, especially out of doors, is as a curative agent, and its high value as an aux- iliary in treatment has already been amply confirmed in the history of this asylum. In this regard, the profits, such as they are, appear gratifying, when it is remembered that employment is mostly limited as a healthful recreation to the morning and evening hours. General health. 27. The sanitary state of the asylum has always been satisfactory. But, as will be understood from the remarks under "mor- tality," many of the patients are in wretched physi- cal health on reception, and most of them, as is customary among the ignorant, neglected, and much-enduring poor, are either anmic, or exhibit symptoms of scurvy, conditions, however, ordinarily susceptible of speedy relief in the absence of organic disease. Apart from such, ailments are rare; a solitary case of pneumonia, occasional trivial derangements of the digestive system, and some passing attacks of ague, comprise the list for the year. Among those remaining at this date, there are 2 cases only of unfavourable promise in respect of physical health, both being dependent on visceral implication, existing antecedent to admission. Buildings. 28. The buildings and out-offices are all in excellent order. No additions or alterations have been made during the year. The accommodation consists of 58 separate cells, 5 associated rooms, a large convalescent ward, and the keeper's room, available for such as have recovered, and may only be awaiting friends to accompany them home. But the space has again become inadequate, and its capacity has been so far strained of late, with a population of 109, that, in the general interests, it has become necessary to decline further admissions; a fact already recounted, and now repeated, under the belief that it presses for early remedy. Extension should be in the direction of providing a separate building for the females, as contemplated when the additional ground, referred to in last report, was purchased. The existing accommodation, it should be added, is admirably adapted in its homely, unpretentious arrange- ments to meet the wants and requirements of the classes it was designed for, a matter of much moment in the interests of the insane, reason in their case being often promoted by the presence of familiar things. Grounds. No further additions have been made to the grounds, the present area of which is some 24 begahs, the larger half now irrigated and under grarden cultivation. The construction of an additional well, mentioned as progressing in last report, was completed in July, at a cost of Rs. 1,147-3-11, entirely defrayed from the profits of the garden. All care, both in supervision and materials, was used, that the new well, equally as that formerly constructed, should be a thoroughly sound, enduring work; and there is certainly nothing better of the kind in this province. It is of solid masonry throughout, 60 feet deep (giving some 35 feet depth of water), and 10 feet inner diameter, provided with fixed chains to meet any accident, and the estimated cost at Public Works Department rates is Rs. 2,400. The difference or saving, equal to Rs. 1,252-12-1, is due to the bricks having been made and the lime burned by the patients, who also supplied much of the unskilled labour employed in the construction. This well as yet is only partially worked in the want of
35 accommodation for bullocks, &c., and the concurrent risks of theft. I refer to these facts only to add that, in the impending necessity for further extension of the asylum buildings, the labour of the lunatics in brick-making, &c., should be utilized in the public interests, and I am prepared to guarantee a satisfactory and economical result. Establishment. 30. Second Class Hospital Assistant Joseph Solomon, General No. 397, is the only member of the 1st class establishment. His duties are very responsible, comprising all details of management in my absence, the issue and supervision of diet and clothing, as well as the allotment and distribution of labour. All these he discharges to my entire satisfaction. 1 Male-keeper. 1 Female do. 9 Warders. 1 Dhobee. 2 Cooks. 2 Sweepers. The 2nd class establishment consists of 16 servants as per margin. The keepers and warders, as will be seen, are in propor- tion of 1 to 10 patients, the authorized complement being 1 to 6; although thus much below the establish- ed strength they are still sufficient, the arrangement of the building affording the means alike of easy supervision and of security. All are efficient and well conducted. Visitors. 31. The visitors have been regular in their half-yearly attendance, and have duly submitted the prescribed reports of the criminal lunatics, one of whom was discharged at their recommendation.
36 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON LUNATICS AND LUNATIC ASYLUMS, NORTHERN DIVISION, FOR THE YEAR 1873-74. Introductory. As there is but one asylum within this circle of supervision, viz.. that of Ahmedabad, prefatory remarks are scarcely neces- sary in the want of grounds for comparison. 2. It may be noted, however, that since its institution the patients have been progressively increasing, the only limit to further aggregation being want of room. Up to 1869 the original accommodation for 75 patients re- mained untouched. From that time the results of yearly experience were as follows :37 AHMEDABAD. 1. This institution, adapted for native insanes only, deservedly holds a high place in popular estimation, alike as respects the excellency of its ar- rangements and the marked success that has hitherto attended its manage- ment. Occupying a well-raised and conveniently chosen site, near to the city, the situation is cheerful, and, at the same time, sufficiently retired ; while the surrounding grounds, extending to some 24 beegahs, mostly under garden cultivation, afford at once a source of peaceful recreation and a means of healthful pursuits. For the rest, the asylum has had the advantage of having been for years under the immediate control of the officer who originally designed it, who has thus throughout naturally identified its interests as specially his own. 2. Built in 1862, and planned for 75 inmates, the accommodation has since been twice extended, and is now adapted for 108. The necessity for further enlargement has again become urgent, as expressed in the fact that patients have latterly been refused for want of room; and I fully concur with the Superintendent that this should take the form of a separate build- ing for the female patients, and entirely endorse the remark made in the opening paragraph of his accompanying report, that this matter should have early consideration, so that timely provision may be made to meet the costs of additional buildings. 3. The total treated was much larger than before, amounting to 142, of whom 34 were fresh admissions. The cures numbered 16, the deaths 8, and 9 were transferred to friends. The average daily population was 105.9. These results, together with the phases of disease treated, are tabulated below38 Full details in reference to the above figures are given by the superin- tendent. It is sufficient here to note that, as compared with the previous year they exhibit an increase of 9 in the total, of 5 in the transferred, of 5 in the deaths, and of 12 in the daily strength, with a decrease of 1 in the cures. There were no escapes throughout. 4. Of the patients, 26 were females classed by caste, 118 were Hin- doos, 23 Mussulmans, and 1 Parsee; socially, 127 were paupers. In 11 cases only were friends able to meet the cost of maintenance; while native States defrayed the expenses in four instances. Regarding the preponderance of paupers, it is observed that insanity is less common under conditions of competency, and is more particularly the disease of poverty and its accom- paniments. 5. Among the admissions there were only 2 formerly under treatment, "and both were instances of relapse due to premature removal by friends before cure was consolidated." Of the number transferred, 3 were so far improved that their ultimate recovery was merely a question of a few weeks at most. 6. It is noted of the nomenclature above followed, that the conditions named were those existent on admission; and that the preponderance of acute mania exhibited is scarcely accurate at this date, since "in the lapse of years many of the cases would necessarily be more correctly included in the chronic category." Adjustment, however, could not be effected without ob- viously destroying the statistical values attaching to the admitted and dis- charged. 7. The cures were relatively fewer than for some years past, and ex- cepting the case of a criminal, sane since 1866, the longest under treatment was 1 year and 9 months, the least 2 months. In estimating the number, it is needful to note, as already remarked, that 3 of the transferred would have swelled the list but for the untimely intervention of friends, as well as to mention that, among those remaining at this date, 8 are convalescents and 11 slowly improving. But, apart from such considerations, results have been in all respects satisfactory, the recoveries being equal to 15.1 on mean daily population; thus, generally, exceeding those of kindred institutions elsewhere, notwithstanding the large residuum of incurable cases that inevitably ac- cumulate in the lapse of years. 8. A table of the duration of the cases from admission is given by the superintendent, and of the total, 15 are shown as under 6 months, 10 under 1 year, 23 from 1 to 2 years, the same number from 2 to 5 years, and 24 above the latter period but under 10 years. Of the remainder, 10 are under 20 and 4 above that term39 10. Twenty of the patients are criminals; their crimes are specified in the asylum report. It will be sufficient here to state that 9 of them are murder- ers. Their cases are all of very enhanced character, with two exceptions, indeed, seemingly hopeless in respect of duration and phase. They have been employed since July last in grain-grinding, and prepare all the flour required for the numerous patients of the Huttesing Hospital. The super- intendent remarks that "any very decided improvement in cases so pro- nounced is, perhaps, scarcely to be expected, but so far work has certainly proved to be in the interests of order and good behaviour, as it has unques- tionably been conducive to physical health." 11. Referring to the females, of whom there are 19 remaining at this date, 1 is almost well and 3 are improving. It is generally notable of them that prospects of recovery are less favourable, partly owing to emotional influences and temperament, and partly also that their cases are, as a rule, more enhanced, and, inferentially, of longer standing; while the difficulty of maintaining order among them, as compared with the men, is a familiar fact. The superintendent notes with satisfaction that "since the introduc- tion of grain-grinding as an employment, some 18 months ago, they have been orderly and quiet, exhibiting a corresponding improvement mentally, as best expressed in the fact that the recoveries have more than doubled." He commends this occupation as one that "has proved most beneficial in averting impending paroxysms of excitement; while it has, moreover, the very great advantage of recalling home associations, and awakening feelings and influences that for the time speak for them. " 12. In respect of causes, 30 of the cases are ascribed to the abuse of ganja, "a fruitful factor in the production of insanity, especially among the vagrant mendicant classes of aboriginal blood." It is probable, however, that there are others due to this cause, as, in the difficulties of obtaining trust- worthy information, conclusions have mostly to be based on observation of habits and addictions as disclosed while under treatment. Dissipation and vice, in conjunction with poverty and its demoralizing accompaniments and surroundings, are no doubt the prime agents here. But the abuse of opium of itself has not at any time appeared as an efficient in the production of in- sanity. The superintendent also notices that social causes are represented, as betrayed by the prevailing hallucinations, and he adds that emotional in- fluences are seldom encountered as a cause except in the educated. 13. The accommodation consists of 58 distinct rooms, each of 800 cubic feet, provided with separate window and door, with suitable provision for ventilation; 6 rooms on the associated principle, a large convalescent ward, and a central hall. The whole is arranged in 4 compartments opening on the latter, by which alone there is communication with the outside. The plan thus affords alike the means of classification, easy supervision, and per- fect security ; while in its subdivision and its homely unpretentious arrange- ments, it adequately meets the requirements of the classes it was designed for, a matter of much importance in the interests of the insane, whose reason will often speak for them, surrounded by familiar things. 14. The management is based on a recognition of the intimate relations existing between mind and body. The primary aim is to diffuse among the inmates a spirit of cheerful contentment, in view to awakening interest and creating confidence, and, "above all, to seek to improve the physical health, and engage the attention by exercise and employment in the open air." No mechanical means of restraint are ever in use, nor is there any padded room.
40 Patient and forbearing attention has proved more efficacious in dealing with the refractory than the employment of coercive measures, and temporary seclusion at most is all that has been necessary. Discipline and order are maintained by an attitude of kindly forbearance and firmness, and, "as a rule, the asylum is as quiet and orderly as a well- regulated household." Games, music, and vernacular newspapers are pro- vided for in-door amusements, and a half-holiday is granted weekly to a very few of the more intelligent of the well-conducted and industrious, who, under suitable supervision, are permitted to visit the city market, provided with a few pice to spend on harmless gratification, an indulgence turned to account as an effective element of discipline and a useful means of gradual rehabitation. 15. Gardening is the chief employment. It can be entered on by all without detriment to caste or creed, and is pursued so successfully that the produce of the asylum garden is noted as the finest in this neighbourhood. The superintendent remarks that "no form of employment can vie with this peaceful, pleasurable pursuit in awakening interest and engaging atten- tions, while its soothing salutary influences, whether under morbid condi- tions of depression or excitement, are abundantly verified in the results of daily observation." That this occupation, highly conducive as it is to phy- sical health and moral well-being, has proved most beneficial here, is best expressed in the fact that for many years past the recoveries among males have been restricted, with rare exceptions, to patients so employed. 16. The profits of labour show satisfactorily, and were larger than before, the realized amount being Rs. 811-1-9, the unrealized Rs. 1,013. Hygienic conditions are excellent, cleanliness is admirably maintained through- out, and the asylum in every detail is fit to bear close inspection at all times, results mainly due to the system and order obtaining among the inmates, since the number of servants, while sufficient, is considerably below the authorized scale, and much of their time is necessarily given to supervision out of doors. 17. The supposition that the insanes have little or no sense of caste differences is scarcely borne out here. While they mingle freely on common ground, they never, on any pretence, enter each other's rooms; and there is in caste prejudices at all times much difficulty in inducing any of them to engage in rope-twisting, tailoring, or basket-work, occupations which they mostly view with insuperable repugnance for that reason alone. 18. The superintendent does not on this occasion touch on details of treatment often before recounted. He notices, however, the benefit he has seen realized from bromide of potassium in cases complicated with epilepsy, and adds that he still occasionally employes hydrate of chloral in excep- tional cases of excitement. An interval of retirement, or seclusion devoted to special treatment, is mentioned as almost invariably necessary at first, and it is understood that counter-irritants in relief of cerebral excitement are then actively employed. 19. The sanitary condition of the asylum is always satisfactory. But conditions of anmia and scorbutus are common among the patients on reception, and many of them are in wretched physical health. 20. No additions have been made to the grounds but a small piece of some 2 beeghas will be required to supplement that bought last year for the proposed female accommodation. This purchase will doubtless be best effected by the superintendent by private arrangement.
41 21. It is mentioned that the fine new well has been successfully com- pleted at an outlay of Rs. 1,147. The estimated cost was Rs. 2,400, and the saving, equal to Rs. 1,253, is due to the labour of the insane42 LUNATICS OUT OF ASYLUMS. 29. In the civil jail, and police, hospitals and dispensaries in the North- ern Division, 34 lunatics received treatment during the year. There were also 2 treated at the Dorabjee Pestonjee's dispensary in the Mhow Division, and 18 in His Highness the Rao's dispensaries at Bhooj and Mandavie. Thus, a total of 54 insanes appears in the various returns of sick received in this office; embracing 30 cases of mania, 8 each of dementia and melan- cholia, 5 of imbecility, and 3 of idiocy. Of the aggregate, 24 were discharg- ed cured, 24 absented, 4 were transferred (all to relatives), and 2 remain under treatment at this date. It is noted of the absented, that they were mostly accompanied by friends, and were lost sight of after brief attendance. No further information is now obtainable, and as no special record of the cases seems to have been kept, the causes cannot now be ascertained. Measures, however, have been taken to secure accurate data, as far as practi- cable, for the future. 30. Compared with the previous year the above figures show an increase of 16 in the total as follows :43 33. In view, however, to throwing some light on the points adverted to, information was sought from the district medical officers as to the luna- tics in their immediate localities, of whom they possessed distinct know- ledge. From the replies received (16 in all) it would appear that in and around the various dispensary towns there is an aggregate of 89 insanes, of whom 66 are cared for by friends, 21 are harmless imbeciles, living at large by mendicancy, 1 also friendless (at Godra) is about to be sent to an asylum, being troublesome, and 1 said to be violent is confined in the Rajkote State Jail. Accepting the results deducible from these figures as equally appli- cable to both collectorates, it may thus be assumed that some 74 per cent. of the insanes and idiots, shown in the census reports, are under the immediate care of friends. 34. Statement No. 5, showing in detail the different institutions in which the above insanes were treated, as compared with the previous year, is herewith attached. ANNUAL REMARKS, 1873-74, SIR COWASJI LUNATIC ASYLUM HAIDARABAD. On the 1st April 1873, there remained 96 lunatics; 79 males and 17 females, and of these 15 were criminal lunatics. On the 1st April 1874, there remained 97 lunatics; 80 males and 17 fe- males, and of these 13 are criminal lunatics. The Asylum44 pound levelled and made as smooth and firm as a croquet ground, and a shed inside enlarged; all this was done by the lunatics and establishment. The bricks were made on the premises, and the few rupees expended were earned by the sale of produce grown in the garden.

R. MILLER, M.D., DEPUTY SURGEON GENERAL, S. D. In accordance with instructions received from the Surgeon General, under date the 1st May 1874, that Government, in their Resolution No. 1087 of 15th April, have desired the reports of lunatic asylums, civil hospitals, and dispensaries, to be submitted separately, the following report of the Sir Cowasjee Jehangeer Asylum, Haidarabad, for the official year 1873-74, is subjoined, with an account also of the lunatics treated in the several civil hospitals, jails, and dispensaries in Sind during the same period. Additional buildings for criminals. In last year's report I took occasion to notice the extremely limited ac- commodation provided for the criminal and refrac- tory class of lunatics, there being only one barrack, designed for 12 persons, situated within the walled enclosure set apart for such lunatics; and I recommended that additional buildings should be erected in the vacant space for this class of insanes who, under present circumstances, are accommodated and looked after with diffi- culty. Government gave their sanction for two additional wards being built; and I had hoped that the standard plan would be set aside in favour of thick cutcha walls and solid roofs, which are universally adopted throughout Sind. But I regret to see that the mistake47 women as formerly it was found iimpossible to keep them quiet and separate from the other classes of lunatics, or to prevent persons coming to them through the hedge which divided their quarters from the public road. Accommodation. The asylum is now capable of accommodating 138 lunatics. At the close of last year there remained 79 males and 17 females, 15 of the whole number being criminals. Admissions. The admissions during the past year have been 38 males, of whom 3 were criminals, and 6 females; making a total of 117 of the former and 23 of the latter; or a grand total of 140 against 143 for the previous year. The average daily number has been 99. Discharged. There have been discharged 30 males, 3 of them being criminals, and 6 females. Of these 21 were cured, or 15 per cent. 15 made over to their friends, and 1 has escaped ; giving, without counting the runaway, a ratio of 9.2 per cent. to number streated. Deaths. Only 7 deaths have occurred48 Forms of insanity most frequent. Dementia and mania are the forms of insanity under which the affection is generally witnessed in persons admitted to this asylum, the latter being in the proportion of nearly 3 to 2 of the former. And when we examine in what ratio the castes are affected by insanity, we find, singularly enough, that it is, with the trifling exception of 3 native Christians, confined exclu- sively to the Mahomedans and Hindoos. The former caste admitted for the past year nearly double of the latter ; while for the one immediately preced- ing, the proportion was even greater. This cannot be explained by the Mahomedans being more numerous than the Hindoos, for the late census has shown that the preponderance is in favour of the Hindoos. The reason must be looked for in another direction; and it is this, the Mahomedans are far more addicted to the use of drugs, especially opium and the various pre- parations of Indian hemp, as also intoxicating liquors and debauchery, than are the Hindoos. Intoxicating drugs, a cause. As Government in paragraph 29 of their Resolution No. 1087, dated 15th April last, express a wish that, if possible, the nature of these drugs should be specified, as helping to decide how far opium and ganja conduce to insanity, I may here give the result of my own experience and that of other medical officers in this Division, whose opinions I formerly had occasion to take regarding the effects of the use and abuse of opium, preparations of Indian hemp, and other intoxicating drugs : 1st, in inducing insanity ; and 2ndly, as to their alleged influence in exciting to violent crime. The natives of Sind are ad- dicted to the use of Indian hemp in all its forms; but "bhang" when taken alone does not, save in exceptional cases, produce mental derangement. Hundreds of natives consume large quantities of this preparation morning and evening, and continue the practice for years ; but apparently none of them become insane in consequence. But "bhang," when mixed with datura to enhance its narcotic properties and taken habitually, does certainly lead to mental disorder. Again, mental aberration is a frequent occurrence among those having recourse to both bhang and opium. With regard to "ganja," which is chiefly smoked like tobacco, this preparation does not appear to be so much indulged in, particularly in the Hydrabad Collectorate, as are the others, viz., bhang, churrus, and mahajum. Class most addicted to their use. The class of people who chiefly addict themselves to the use of these narco- tics, to which also may be added opium, are Mahomedans. Hindoos again, who are not restricted, as are the latter race, incline rather to alcoholic liquors when seeking a stimulant. But with the Mahomedans in this pro- vince, the cheapness, freedom from the danger of fatal poisoning by an over- dose, their unadulterated state49 and they flee from imaginary terrors and enemies, believing themselves pur- sued by fire, floods of water, or rabid animals. The habitual use of these preparations, no matter what the form selected, has the effect generally of demoralizing their votaries, of exciting their worse passions, and leads them to commit crimes of various kinds and degree; but when offences of a more serious nature are meditated, arising from jealousy, hatred, and revenge, opium is more frequently had recourse to. Insanity produced by their use. Now when it is remembered that it is the Mahomedans rather than the Hindoos who are most afflicted with insanity, and that to a double extent, and that intoxicating drugs are very largely used by this class and not by the other, the inference is not an unfair one, that to these are to be debited as not inconsiderable proportion of the cases of insanity which are met with throughout the province. The results on separate castes should be shown separately. That this may be rendered more apparent, in so far as these affect the different castes, it would be well, in future, when tabulating the causes of insanity, to show the castes separately, noting also the sex. Little or no contribu- tions received from pati- ents. From the annual abstract of patients it will be seen that, with few excep- tions, the admissions consist either of fukeers and mendicants, or persons of no occupation. Those entered as cultivators, labourers, &c., are the ex- ceptions; and as a class they are generally very bad- ly off. There is very little income, therefore, obtained towards the support of the asylum from those who are immediately benefited by it; and in the case of those few who are differently circumstanced, there is always a great difficulty experienced in making their relatives contribute towards their sup- port. As an improvement on the present system, I would suggest that whenever district magistrates direct the confinement of lunatics, they should be enjoined in all cases, when doing so, to satisfy themselves either that the insanes are absolutely paupers with no relatives to help them, or if they have friends in a position to maintain them wholly or in part, that these should be obliged to enter into certain approved arrangements to insure monthly payment towards their support. Ordinary diseases in lunatics. The ordinary diseases in addition to the mental malady affecting the inmates of the asylum have been fevers, diarrh50 Hospital not used. Verandah in present condition useless. At my inspection 1 found the hospital empty and not used. Dr. Holme- sted informed me that the sick were permitted to re- main in the barracks amongst the other lunatics and were treated there. But this is a very irregular proceeding, and I directed that the hospital in future should be used to segregate the sick from the others in place of their being indiscriminately mixed up together. In a former report, when speaking of the narrowness of the verandah, only 6 feet 10 inches, I remarked that the shelter afforded by it was reduced to a minimum, in consequence of the verandah posts being 13 feet high ! In a climate like Sind, it is a great matter to have a good, broad, verandah to keep off the sun, especially in an hospital ; and I would strongly recom- mend that on the west and south sides it should be increased to a width of 12 feet, which could be done at small expense. Sleeping-blocks not yet removed. The sleeping-blocks, in both hospital and barracks, which were condemned and their removal recommended and approved of, are still in statu quo. They are very much in the way, in addition to being quite useless. Late increase to establishment. The increase to the establishment of one extra matron and six additional warders, temporarily sanctioned last year as an ex- perimental measure, has received the permanent sanc- tion of Government. The benefits resulting from this arrangement have been very apparent. Cost of establishment. The entire cost of the establishment for the past year, including the medi- cal officer's salary, is Rs. 4,860 ; or excluding this, it amounts to Rs. 3,060. Diets have cost Rs. 3,217, and miscellaneous, including clothing, furniture, and burials, Rs. 1,354. Total expenditure. The total expenditure for the year has come to Rs. 9,431; and taking this as the basis, the average cost of each lunatic has amounted to Rs. 95-4-4, which is Rs. 9-12-5 less than that of the previous year. The average daily number of lunatics employed in labour has been 39, and the income these have earned has averaged Rs. 22-5-5 each. The annual cost of these, therefore, has averaged Rs. 72-14-9. Each patient in the asylum has cost for the past year, in relation to establishment, Rs. 50-1-7, to diet; Rs. 34-5-8, to contingencies and clothing Rs. 18-1-10. Diet. The superintendent states that the diet is suitable and sufficient. It con- sists of two meals daily. It contains 293 grains of nitrogen and 5,133 of carbon, which forms a normal quantity of these constituents for proper nourishment. To those who are sick and who are engaged in work in the cold weather, a little curd or milk is added. Treatment. The method of treating the insane is conducted on the same principles as formerly mentioned, viz., kindness and firmness, combined with an observance of the broad rules of
51 Nature of employment. hygiene. To this is added moderate exercise, and when it is possible, en- gaging the patients in occupation and amusements, so as to divert their minds from brooding over their mental condition. The criminal and refractory portion only are kept apart. The others are employed in gardening, brick- making, or drawing water. As an instance of one of the many ways in which the services of the more tractable portions of the insane may be turned to account, I was shown a large bullock-shed, built of sun-dried bricks, the entire work of the lunatics, assisted by some of the warders. And at the time of my visit, while the new barracks were in progress, I found as many as thirty of the patients employ- ed by the contractor in carrying loads, bringing water, and other similar work. And in consideration of the help thus afforded him, he had engaged, on completion of the barracks, to pay Rs. 275 towards the support of the asylum. Wells. The plunge-bath completed a year ago was much used during the hot months, and with great benefit to the patients. The wells, however, have not been covered in. One is nearly so; and to this a couple of pumps were fixed, which has resulted in rather a failure, owing to their continually getting out of order. Some other method, therefore, of raising the water will have to be adopted if the remain- der of the wells are to be covered in, as they certainly should be. Conservancy. The conservancy has been considerably improved. In the women's quar- ter, a privy has been constructed on the plan followed. in the jail. This system is also carried out in the walled enclosure where the criminal lunatics are confined; and is partially so in the two other latrines near the public road. Conduct of establish- ment. The superintendent reports favourably of the warders and attendants. They have worked well and treated the patients with kindness and consideration. His hospital assist- ant likewise has given satisfaction, and understands the art of gaining the confidence of the lunatics. And as regards Dr. Hol- mested, I have much pleasure in bringing to notice the care and attention he bestows on everything connected with the asylum, by which he has turned to the best account the rather unpromising materials and arrange- ments placed at his disposal. Lunatics other than those in asylum. In addition to the patients I have just been describing, it will be seen by a reference to table appended, compiled from the re- turns of the civil, jail, and police hospitals and dispensaries, that 65 persons were treated as insanes during the year under review. This is 6 more than for the previous year. Of this number, 20 are reported to have been cured against 10 in 1872-73 ; 6 absented, that is, the friends who had charge of them and brought them for treatment desisted doing so on their being relieved or proving harmless, there were 28 transferred to lunatic asylums, and 11 made over to their friends. The whole number is thus accounted for52 Class. They are classified as follows :53 Difficulties of diagnosis. ment with the help of their friends or the police, until it is determined whether or not they are fit subjects to be sent to the asylum. Also people supposed to be of unsound mind are occasionally sent to hospitals and dispensaries for an opinion as to their sanity by magistrates, before whom they have been charged with some offence; and it is generally necessary to keep such persons under observa- tion for a longer or shorter period before the question can be decided, and these are often entered in the returns as insane. Again, persons labouring under the temporary excitement produced by intoxicating drugs are not un- frequently looked upon as insane, and are recorded in the books as such. It is a matter of some difficulty, especially when medical subordinates have to pronounce judgment, to determine in all cases who are and who are not insane. However, it is hoped that the instructions which will be issued to all medical subordinates on various points in connection with insanes and those supposed to be such, will render future returns more accurate, and afford information of a more precise and valuable nature. 8 L A

Administration Reports. No. 9. GENERAL DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 5th January 1875. Memorandum from the Surgeon General, Indian Medical Department, No. 3301, dated the 14th October 18742 in a great many instances for reasons that are sufficiently obvious, and that, for the year under report, in only 54.5 per cent. cases amongst males and 58.1 per cent. amongst the females have the causes been recorded. The details of these are as follows :3 6. Amongst Europeans insanity was most prevalent between the ages of 20 and 25, there being 32 cases amongst men of that age. There were 25 cases between 25 and 30, 15 between 30 and 35, and 12 between 35 and 40, leaving 8 cases, 1 of which was below 20 and 7 above 40. Somewhat different results are shown by the Native returns. Out of 705 cases of which the ages are given, 99 were between 20 and 25, 121 between 25 and 30, 129 between 30 and 35, and 119 between 35 and 40. The fact that insanity attacks Europeans more early than Natives is doubt- less due to climate. As regards race the Asylum population was divided as follows:4 in Council is glad that the Surgeon General has pointed out how very much the Asylums in this Presidency are behind those elsewhere. At Colaba not one European or Eurasian or Parsee appears to have been employed, while out of a daily average of 94.0 male Hindoos and 49.0 male Mussulmans, only 26.0 and 28.0 respectively were employed. At Poona out of a daily average of 47.4 men only 6.0, at Dharwar out of 19.0 only 7.0, and at Hy- derabad out of 82.0 only 24.0 were employed, Out of 17 females in the last-mentioned Asylum 15, and at Ahmedabad out of 18.8 females 8, were employed, which is an improvement. But at none of the other Asylums was any female labour made use of at all. In Ahmedabad alone do the results approach the mark which Government hope all will reach to in time. At that Asylum out of a daily average of 87 males 61.6 were employed re- gularly. The Resolution on the Report for 1872-73, in which attention was called to the necessity of increasing the Lunatics' employment, was issued too late for any reforms to take place in the year now under consideration (1873-74), and Government will only again express a hope that the injunc- tions they have issued will be gradually acted up to. Government are aware that the space at Colaba is too small, and the Asylum too crowded to allow any extensive work being undertaken, but are of opinion that more might be done; while the Asylum at Hyderabad was expressly placed in an otherwise objectionable site, with a view that the extensive garden around it might afford occupation to the Lunatics. In reference to this, however, His Excellency in Council is glad to find that the Superintendent has com- menced putting the men to labour in the garden, and that he hopes before long to remove most of the defects of the site. Undoubtedly the present report shows a great improvement in this Asylum over the year before. Arrangements are now in progress for the better employment of the Lunatics at Poona. At the Dharwar Asylum, with respect to which it was reported last year that the inmates were largely employed in gardening, it is now stated that only 7 out of 24 can be trusted on that work, but no attempt to employ the remainder in-doors has apparently been made. There can be no reason why grinding corn at least should not be undertaken here, as elsewhere. 10. There were 76 Criminal Lunatics, the same as in 1872-73. Of these 48 have been guilty of murder or culpable homicide, 6 of grievous hurt, 14 of theft, and the remainder of miscellaneous offences. 11. His Excellency in Council is indebted to the Surgeon General for the very careful manner in which he has compiled the financial results of the year in Statement 14. From this it appears that the total cost of the five Asylums amounted to Rs. 93,063, or Rs. 17,852 less than in the previous year, the net cost, after deducting cash receipts and the estimated value of Lunatics' labour, &c., being Rs. 83,713. The average annual cost of each European and Eurasian was Rs. 310-6-7, being Rs. 71-11-11 less than in 1872-73, the cost of each Native being Rs. 154-11-5, an improvement by Rs. 28-9-10. The inclusion of Colaba in the general averages last quoted makes a considerable difference, since, as pointed out, there is a medical officer there in sole charge; whereas the Asylums at other places are merely adjuncts to the Civil Surgeon's ordinary duties. The following are the figures as regards Natives for each Asylum separately, receipts being deduct- ed from the gross expenditure. At Colaba each Native Christian (includ- ing Parsees and Jews) costs Rs. 217-1-8 against Rs. 272-4-2 in the previous
5 year, the cost of each Hindoo or Mahomedan being Rs. 203-3-7 against Rs. 258-10-7. At Poona the cost of each Native was Rs. 187-3-4, a slight increase over 1872-73, due to a large expenditure on new bedding. At Dharwar the cost was Rs. 136-8-5, almost the same as before, while at Ahmedabad the cost was reduced from Rs. 95-12-4 to Rs. 82-10-9, and at Hyderabad from Rs. 99-7-1 to Rs. 86-7-5. The average cost of each Native in relation to establishment varied from Rs. 37-1-7 at Ahmedabad to Rs. 105-9-2 at Colaba. The average cost in relation to diet, which is an important item, the charges on this account coming to about 40 per cent. of the total net expenditure, shows in all cases a great improvement. The dieting of Europeans was Rs. 200-9-1 and of Native Christians, &c., at Colaba Rs. 114-0-2 per head, as against Rs. 220-0-6 and 159-11-0 in 1872-73. The cost of dieting Natives was as follows :6 and Rs. 4,503-9-8 respectively being received under this head. The numbers of paying patients were7 16. Except at one or two places, Lunatics of the above class are kept for such a short time that the accommodation at present provided seems sufficient. Government will, however, await any proposals which the Surgeon General may think fit to submit separately as to the need which is alleged to exist for improvements to the Satara and Sholapur Civil Hospitals, and for in- creased establishments at the Dhulia Lunatic Wards. 17. The separate reports of the Superintendents of the Asylums and the reviewing remarks of the Surgeon General and his Deputies have been read by His Excellency in Council with interest. The names of the authors of the reports have in some instances been omit- ted, an error to which attention was called in the Resolution on last year's report. All seem to have given thought and care to their charges, and the scantiness of the report by the Surgeon in charge of the Dharwar Asylum may be excused on the ground that materials of interest were absent. 18. Government regret that the most important Asylum, that at Cola- ba, should be so deficient in room, an evil which, as has been said, prevents, to a very great extent, the proper employment of the patients, tends to foster disease from excessive crowding, and stands in the way of the proper segre- gation of the different classes of Insanes. There is no doubt also that the water-supply is very bad, and that a proper Hospital is needed. These are evils which are fully recognized, and Government do not expect the same re- sults that would follow were the Asylum more roomy and convenient. At the same time, with claims on them from all quarters, they do not feel them- selves in a position to make any change at present, in addition to those which have been carried out of late years. In default of a comprehensive scheme of Central Lunatic Asylums, the plan which it would seem advisable ulti- mately to carry out would be the conversion of the Colaba Asylum into a house for incurable Lunatics, the establishment at which it would cost comparative- ly little, and the erection of another Asylum at some suitable and cheap place like Poona, where space could be had, and cures could be effected. His Excellency in Council will feel obliged by the Surgeon General giving this subject his mature consideration, and reporting fully on the entire subject. In reviewing the report for 1871-72 His Excellency in Council called for such a report, but none has yet been received. Under the smaller scheme which has been adverted to, the accommodation reserved at Colaba for Military Lu- natics who come to Bombay for a short time prior to departure by the Troop- ships would not need to be disturbed., Government believe such an arrange- ment would be a really economical measure, as cures would be sooner effect- ed, and if the New Asylum were amalgamated with one now existing, the in- creased cost of establishment would be but small. The Surgeon General has already been asked to consider whether the institution of a Private Lunatic Asylum for patients able to pay for their maintenance is not possible with so many Native Graduates competent to undertake it, and if this be found feasi- ble, it will help to relieve the State Asylums. 19. As far as the water-supply at Colaba is concerned, it is patent that nothing can be done until the scheme for supplying the town separately with water from the Toolsee Lake has been carried out. 20. The system on which the workshop is carried on at Colaba, viz., at the risk of the Superintendent, is decidedly bad, and His Excellency in Coun-
8 cil cannot but feel surprised that it should have been allowed to continue so long. The balance at the credit of the Fund should be paid in to Govern- ment, and the Superintendent of this, as all other Asylums, should budget annually for the sum required to be expended in materials, &c., and the re- ceipts he expects to obtain. The sum required for petty payments to enable discharged Lunatics to reach their homes, and the like, should be budgetted for in a similar way. In connection with this subject Government desire to know the circumstances under which contributions were made to the Work- shop Fund by His Highness Tookajee Holkar and the other Native Chiefs who subscribed Rs. 465. 21. As has already been remarked, improvements to the Poona Asylum have already been sanctioned. Government trust that when water is laid on from Kurruckwasla, no further complaints about the management of this Asylum will be heard. 22. A suggestion has been made in the report for supplying the Poona Asylum with clothing at cost price from the Jail. This is a matter which is entirely for the disposal of the Surgeon General, who will take care that the clothing, as well as all other requisites, is obtained in the cheapest and most suitable way. 23. Further remarks on the Dharwar Asylum are unnecessary. The state of that at Ahmedabad seems highly satisfactory, and credit is due to Dr. Wyllie and his Assistant Mr. Solomon accordingly. In reference to the sug- gestion that the Gaekwar's Durbar should be called on to defray the ex- penses of Gaekwaree subjects admitted into the Asylum, the Surgeon Gene- ral should be requested to ascertain what patients there are under this head, and what the annual cost is on account of them, and the Political Depart- ment will be requested, if there be no objection, to arrange for its recovery. 24. Government have no objection to the Superintendent's purchasing two beeghas more of ground for this Asylum, if he can arrange for it and has the necessary funds. There would appear to be a separate fund kept in the hands of the Superintendent for such purposes, although this is not directly stated. Government must, therefore, point out that if this is the case it is irregular, and the Superintendent should, as directed above, budget for all he wants, paying all receipts into the Treasury. Government have no wish to curtail his means, and will allow him asmuch as he wants, provided that when receipts are deducted the outlay does not exceed the present charge. 25. His Excellency in Council notices that dry-earth conservancy is adopted at Ahmedabad, and that the poudrette is turned to very good ac- count in the garden. There is no doubt that the manure is most valuable, and the dry-earth system excellent, where proper arrangements can be made for carrying it out. 26. His Excellency in Council is not of opinion that the hedge around the Cowasjee Jehangir Asylum, which is described by Dr. Miller as being only a hedge in name, should be got rid of altogether, and a wall of sun-dried bricks, which the Lunatics might make themselves, substituted. If the hedge, which could be improved, is sufficient to keep the Lunatics from escaping, it is not advisable to convey to them a more decided sense of confinement and
9 restraint by the erection of a wall. The removal of the sleeping blocks and the widening of the Hospital verandah might be carried out as proposed. 27. In future reports it should be stated whether the Visitors have in- spected each Asylum regularly. 28. A new set of Forms received from the Government of India has recently been sanctioned for adoption in Lunatic Asylums in this Presidency. His Excellency in Council desires that these be supplemented by Returns No. 9, Condition as to marriage ; No. 12, Criminal Lunatics, which should be No. 12 and 13 in the new set ; and that an expansion of No. 11, showing how the Lunatics were employed, be also added. Separate Forms for Europeans and Eurasians should still be kept. The reports of the Superintendents need not be printed in future. 29. His Excellency in Council will conclude by thanking the Surgeon General for the able and careful manner in which the results of the year have been put before Government, and for the supervision he has exercised over this Branch of his Department. The Deputy Surgeons General also merit His Excellency's acknowledgments. F. S. CHAPMAN, Chief Secretary to Government.

Dharwar AsylumNo. 3372 of 1875, FROM THE SURGEON-GENERAL, Indian Medical Department; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, General Department. Bombay, 29th July 1875. SIR, I have the honour to submit the annual report on lunatic asylums in the Bombay Presidency and Sind for the year 1874-75. New Forms introduced. 2. Since my last report was submitted, eleven new forms for tabula- tion have been received from the Government of India, to which this Government have added two of those given with the former report. These new forms have now been brought into general use, and will be found in the appendix to this report; they are:2 formation would be considered by the profession more valuable if afforded by the Superintendents themselves ; the reports of the Deputy Surgeons- General need not be printed. Statement No. 1, Popula- tion, &c. Remained. Admissions and Re-ad- missions. Discharged. Deaths. Remained on 31st March 1875. 4. Commencing with Statements No. 1, they show that the total population in our asylums was 849 as compared with 810 of the previous year. Of these there remained on the 1st April 1874, 428 males and 96 females, making a total of 524. There were 312 new admissions3 would be 7.6, or nearly 05 per cent. more than last year. In the same way if the " cured and improved" be calculated on the total treated, the percentage would be about 15.9, or 0.5 less than in the preceding year. Percentages on Total Treated. 10. It appears to me that the percentages would give a much more correct notion of cured, &c., were they calculated on the total treated, and not on the daily average strength. To illustrate this, I would point to State- ment No. 1 for Dharwar Asylum, in which the average daily strength of females in 1864 was 1.7, while the cures were 2, or a percentage higher than the strength. It is evident that by calculating percentages on average strength or on admissions that both the cures and deaths might be more than the average daily strength and above the number of admissions ; there- fore I am of opinion that Statement No. 1 requires the addition of two columns under heading 114 establishment it is necessary that an asylum for criminals should be as safe as a prison, without losing its proper character of an asylum for insanes. Religion, Sex and Resi- dency of Lunatics. 13. Statements No. 3 show the religion, sex, and residency of the patients admitted during the year. Of the 325, 100 were English, and all the others were natives of India, except 8. Of Hindus there were 101 males and 21 females5 Among the moral causes, grief accounts for 50 of the total number (84), religion was the cause in 11 cases, and loss of money in 8. 18. Statements No. 8 give a detail of the sick in the hospitals of the asylums or the bodily ailments under which the insanes suffered. Colaba, apart from its insalubrity and over-crowded state, having most insanes, has also by far the most sick ; the chief complaints in our asylums being fever and affections of the stomach and bowels. At Coloba there was a large number of skin diseases, for the prevalence of which the Superintendent accounts by the limited space not permitting of segregation. This may be partly due to men from up-country residing so near the sea and at so low a level. Cash Accounts of Asylums. 19. Statements No. 9 show the cash accounts of the asylums,6 No. 9.

7 The money actually drawn from the Treasury amounted to Rs. 88,820, and if we deduct from this the sum of Rs. 5,376 paid into the Treasury the balance of Rs. 83,444 represents the cost to the State of our insanes. As the aver- age daily strength of the insanes was 553.9, or say 554, the average cost of each inmate was Rs. 150-9-11 for the year. This average represents the cost for Europeans and natives taken together. The annual cost per head is shown in the foregoing statement; but it should be remembered that in calcu- lating the averages no credit has been taken for receipts paid into the Trea- sury; hence the sum of the items is greater than the total, which represents the exact cost to the State. The actual cost to the State per head in each of the five asylums is as follows :8 In the year 1873-74 there were only 182.6 insanes employed, whereas in the year under report the number was 238.6. Although the total credits are only Rs. 2,892 from manufactures, &c., it is to be remembered, that profit is only a secondary consideration, and that employment as a means of cure is the most valuable agent we have. Condition of Insanes as regards Marriage. 22. Statements No. 12 show the condition of the insanes as regards mar- riage. The single numbered 4019 higher cost of maintenance and the want of means of giving suitable employ- ment to them in that institution. I will now make some remarks on each of our asylums10 months, the soil about the upper part of the asylum and in the airing courts is often soaking during the monsoon season. The three main drains which convey all the liquid matter and waste water of the establishment to the sea- shore very frequently become choked, as all sewers opening on a flat tidal surface are liable to be. They are covered in, and furnished at intervals with trap-doors for the purpose of seeing that they are clean and free. Conservancy. 30. The night-soil is regularly removed to some distance on the shore by the regular staff of sweepers on the establishment, and carbolic acid and McDougall's powder freely used daily for deodorizing and disinfecting purposes. Winds. 31. The prevailing winds are from the S. and S.W., and they thorough- ly penetrate the upper floor of the asylum ; but when the wind is light, the lower floor in the south wing is often very close, and disagreeably hot and steamy. Vaccination. 32. Vaccination was practised on 71 patients who bore neither marks of small-pox nor previous vaccination; but as only 34 proved successful, it may be inferred that the larger number of the 71 had really previously suffered from mild small-pox, or had been vaccinated. General Health. 33. The health of the inmates generally has been good. There was no epidemic, nor have any severe diseases prevailed to any extent. It is stated that scabies and ringworm caused the greatest number of admissions on the sick list. Dr. Murphy says that "in an asylum so crowded, and where there are no means of isolating the affected cases at night, this must necessarily to a certain extent be expect- ed." Dysentery and Diarrh11 difficult to know what to undertake so as to cover the outlay and give suit- able employment to the lunatics, at the same time few, if any, of them are handicraftsmen or tradesmen, nearly all belonging to the class of wandering beggars or religious mendicants. It is obvious that some kind of agricultural labour or gardening would suit best, but this is impracticable for want of soil and water, a fact of which Government are already aware. The greatest economy and supervision have been exercised in the regulation and distribu- tion of the food. The diet is a very liberal one." Out-door Employment of Inmates. 36. The difficulty of finding out-door employment for the greater part of the patients is insurmountable. A few are employed in the workshop, a few help in keeping the garden clean and in the general conservancy of the whole interior of the asylum ; but for agricultural labour there is no ground and yet this kind of employment is the very best curative agency known to, the profession. Employment12 majority of these cases the cause of their insanity is entered as 'unknown'. I make no doubt, however, excessive indulgence in spirits, coupled with climate, are constant factors. It might be interesting to observe that there are more dementia cases than usual, and that the total number of military treated shows an increase of 19 as compared with the previous year." A loose statement of this kind, regarding the constant factor in causation, is of no real value, more especially as the family history in re- gard to heredity is wanting. There, surely, ought not to be much, if any, difficulty in obtaining the causes in the cases of soldiers and their wives. Europeans only tempo- rary Residents. 41. As stated in my report for last year, the history of Europeans is mainly one of reception and discharge during the trooping season. Civilian Europeans. 42. The civilian Europeans numbered 16 under treatment, 2 of whom were criminals, 1 of whom recovered and was sent to England at the Government expense. There were 3 of the non-criminals sent home at a cost, to Government, of Rs. 1,100, exclusive of outfit ; and an Italian was handed over to his Consul to be sent to Italy; 3 recovered and were discharged ; and 113 Magistrates should be allowed some latitude in this matter. With the advice of the Civil Surgeon and the evidence of the relatives and police, a Magistrate would have little difficulty in many cases of coming to a conclusion on the subject of the insane being a harmless or dangerous lunatic. As a matter of fact there must be thousands of lunatics among our population, and yet it is, comparatively, quite a rare thing to hear of violence done by them. Deaths. 45. The deaths among natives amounted to 33, of whom 24 were males and 9 females, the total being the same as in the year preceding. The percentage of deaths to admissions is greater among females than males. Causes. 46. The causes of lunacy among natives are, probably, in kind much the same as among all races : here ganja and opium taking the place of alcoholic liquors. Cures. 47. With regard to cures, Deputy Surgeon-General Johnstone re- marks:14 New Airing Court. 53. A new airing court has lately been completed, which will be of some advantage in classifying the patients. I have observed invariably at my visits to the asylum that in the male yard some of the insanes appeared to be in a state of excitement, which probably would have been mitigated, if not prevented, had there been the means of separating the patients. Workshop. 54. The income of the workshop amounted to Rs. 542-5-9, which, added to the sum of Rs. 246-5-9, carried forward from the previous year, gives a total of Rs. 788-11-6. The sum of Rs. 358-4-10 was paid into the Treasury, the balance having been expended on material, and in giving small sums to discharged patients to help them on their way home. The chief employment is cane-work ; a few helping the tailor, mason, and carpenter. In comparing the total amount realized by the workshop this year with that of last, there is an increase of Rs. 170. Income. 55. The following details show the income and sources of it:15 Reduction in Cost of each Patient. 57. Notwithstanding the increase of patients by 25 on the daily average, the total expenditure was less than in the preceding year by about Rs. 170, but I observe that nearly the whole of the saving was effected on estab- lishments and clothing. It is probable the stock of clothing was too large ; but the Superintendent should arrange to keep up the stock to the full requirements of the institution by regular annual supplies, which will be as nearly as possible about the same in quantity and value each year; otherwise there will be the liability to have an excessive charge in any one year with a corresponding saving in the following one, as pointed out in my report of the previous year. Dr. Murphy speaks well of the conduct of his establish- ment, and I have much pleasure in stating that Dr. Murphy's superinten- dence has been satisfactory for the few months he has been in charge of the Colaba Lunatic Asylum. Criminal Lunatics. 58. There were 28 native criminal lunatics admitted during the year; in the previous ten years the highest number in any one year was 8. The reason of the great increase is that the criminal lunatics were transferred from the Poona and Dharwar asylums to Colaba by order of Government. With regard to the establish- ment of an asylum for criminal lunatics in connection with the Yerauda Jail, I have already addressed Government in letter No. 314, of 22nd January 1875, to the Secretary, General Department. It is believed the Medical Officer there could superintend both jail and asylum. It is a mistake to send criminal lunatics to the most expensive place in the whole Presidency; and besides that, the fact of it becoming known that criminal lunatics are all sent to Colaba, must and does injure the asylum as an institution for paying patients. I think every encouragement ought to be given to induce well-off relatives to send their insanes to our asylum, not only for safe custody and treatment, but to prevent insanes begetting progeny which might be afflicted with their parents' malady. I have consulted some of the leading native gentlemen and some private medical practitioners, and all agree that the establishment of a private asylum is not practicable at present. POONA ASYLUM. Superintendence. 59. Dr. Lord, acting Civil Surgeon, was in charge of the Poona Asy- lum for the whole year, except a few days ; but the report was written by Dr. Davidson, Assistant Civil Surgeon. Dr. Davidson says that he knows little of the working of the asy- lum from personal experience, and that, in short, he writes from the figures before him. It is to be regretted Dr. Lord did not either himself write the report, or leave notes on which Dr. Davidson might have entered more fully into the past year's working of this asylum. Buildings, Alterations, and Improvements. 60. The asylum in Poona was not built for its present purpose but was a private dwelling. It is needless to say that such a building can hardly be made a suitable one for insanes, and at best it can only be looked on as a make-shift, until Government find it convenient to erect the long-projected asylum. But as the time for erecting the Deccan asylum appeared to be as distant as ever, it was found necessary to improve the present one, re- garding which Dr. Davidson writes : 16 alterations and improvements, some of which are already finished, have been sanctioned and are being carried out, and when the whole are completed the hygienic and sanitary condition of the asylum will be much improved, its accommodation will be considerably extended, means will be available for a certain degree of classification, or, at any rate, for the separation of the noisy and violent patients from the others ; and, lastly, scope will be afforded for the useful and possibly remunerative employment of the insanes. Ten new separate rooms have been built on the male side of the asylum for the ac- commodation of noisy patients, and on the female side five similar rooms are in course of construction." These additions have been built with due regard to ventilation, cubic and superficial space. In the new male rooms the cubic space is 1,250 feet, and in the female it will be 1,000 feet; the superficial area in both being 100 square feet. The wretched huts which stood on the south of the asylum have been replaced, at a cost of Rs. 1,700, by a line of good houses capable of containing the families of ten servants. The huts on the west have been removed, with the exception of one for the sweeper. On the female side two rooms are being built for the accommodation of the female warders. Water. 61. The Kharakwsla water has been laid on, and 4 standing taps have been erected17 was18 Mechanical Restraint. 73. No mechanical restraint was used, and the patients were easily managed. DHARWAR ASYLUM. Superintendence. 74. The lunatic asylum at Dharwar is under the charge of the Civil Surgeon at that station, Accommodation. 75. It is contiguous to the civil hospital, and is a very poor place indeed, affording very miserable accommodation for about 18 insanes; as compared with any of our other asylums it is by far the least suited for its purposes. It has two wards or day-rooms and 18 cells, but when the present regimental hospital is transferred for the use of the civil patients the building at pre- sent occupied by these will afford increased accommodation for insanes. The two day-rooms are for the separation of the sexes. The male day-room has 7,950 cubic feet of air and the female 5,300. There are small court-yards in which the patients take air and as much exercise as such a limited space can allow of. In these small courts there are two privies, one for females and the other for males, and on either side the range of cells, each of which is 12 feet by 10 and 11 1/4 feet high : so each contains 1,350 cubic feet of air. The ventilation is said to be good both in the cells and day-rooms. Two of the cells are padded rooms, and used for refractory patients. Padded rooms in India are objection- able, as they give cover to vermin, and as a matter of fact they are now little used anywhere. The accommodation is not equal to the requirements of the district, and during the year many applications for admission had to be refused. Unsuitability of this Asylum. 76. This asylum is about as unsuited for curative purposes as it well can be ; and as regards classification all that can be done is to separate one sex from the other. But the mild and gentle monomaniac recovering to sanity is compelled to associate with the foul and obscene howling maniac who constantly shocks every sense of decency. Although the building is really intended for only 18 patients yet 24 have been crowded into it at one time : the excess were placed at night in the day-rooms,19 Causes. 79. The alleged causes of the insanity are stated to be ganja in 2 males, fever in 1 male, grief in 3 cases20 Associated Rooms21 Mean Population. between these two percentages of 3.7 is the rate of increase in the insanes for the year. Dr. Wyllie states that in English county and borough asylums this rate is 2.8 and in Bengal in 1873 it was 3.1. But it is manifest that this rate here is liable to extreme variations, as we have never yet met the wants of this Presidency in regard to the necessary accommodation for our insanes. The average number of daily inmates was 108.9, or 90.4 males and 18.5 females. This average has more than doubled in the last ten years, and in the same period the increase in the number of persons treated amounts to 67.5 per cent. Cured, transferred, &c. 81. Ten were discharged as cured, 6 were transferred to friends, 1 escaped, 9 died, and at the end of the year under report there remained 113, or 4 more than in the preceding year. The cures and transfers to friends are somewhat less than in the preceding year. Of the cured 1 had been over 8 years in the asylum, 1 over 2 years, and 2 for over 21 months. These 4 showed no signs of improvement, Dr. Wyllie says, until after they had been more than a year in the asylum: all the rest of the cured were less than a year under treatment. Of the 6 transferred, only 3 showed signs of improvement. Long Residence. 92. Dr. Wyllie says with reference to the effect of long residence, &c. :22 fever, 2 were hereditary, and 6 congenital. Dr. Wyllie says :23 Criminals. 102. There were 25 criminals treated during the year. Of these 19 remained from the previous year, 5 were admitted during the year, and 1 of them was re-admitted, 1 was discharged cured, 1 was handed over to friends by Government Reso- lution, and he was the re-admission, 3 died, and there remained at the close of the year 20, or 1 more than in the preceding year. One only has been troublesome. Their crimes were :24 daily strength of 108.9 the daily average number employed was 71.6." This gives a small increase as compared with the average for 1873-74. Dr. Wiehe very judiciously remarks :25 Conduct of Establishment. 110. Both Drs. Johnson and Wiehe speak in high terms of the conduct of the establishment. Dr. Wiehe is of opinion that two more warders are necessary, especially to guard those taken to out-door employment. Hitherto patients affected with chronic mania, melancholia, and dementia have been allowed " to remain in-doors, idle and listless, partly from want of warders and partly also from their own aversion to move out of their groove, &c." This subject will be separately represented. Drs. Wiehe and Johnson both commend the zeal and intelli- gence of 2nd Class Hospital Assistant Joseph Soloman, who is the factotum of the Superintendent. Dr. Johnson says:26 found difficult; and he would imply that the cost of maintaining the hedge, as it ought to be, will probably be as great as that of the construction of a wall. He further adds, that as the hedge is insufficient to prevent the insanes from escaping, they have to be shut up in the wards at night 27 Food. 118. The food consists of 12 ozs. of flour (alternately wheat, jowari, and bajri),12 ozs. of rice,  oz. of ghee, 3 ozs. dall (instead, twice a week, 4 ozs. meat), 4 drachms curry-stuff, 4 ozs. vegetables. According to Dr. Lyon's food equivalents this gives28 Re-admissions. 125. Dr. Holmsted in his report says:29 ment in the garden for males, and for females grinding the grain required for the asylum. A few musical instruments have been procured, which are issued out in the evening two or three times a week: some play, while others dance and caper around; it helps to make them happy and cheerful.' " Expenditure. 134. The total expenditure was Rs. 9,615-14-2 or Rs. 184-3-7 more than in the previous year, and the cost of each patienet was Rs. 95-3-4, or about the same as in the previous year. The monthly pay of the establishment is Rs. 405. The garden produce yielded Rs. 190, besides supplying the inmates with abundance of vegetables. Conduct of Establishment. 135. The conduct of the establishment has been well reported of, but occasional instances of laziness and carelessness are mentioned. First Class Hospital Assistant J. F. Mendez is well spoken of by Dr. Miller; and as regards the Superintend- ent, Dr. Holmsted, he says :30 139. Sind Division.ANNUAL STATEMENTS.

64 No. 13( 1 ) Annual Reports (Lunatic Asylums). No. 2856. GENERAL DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 18th September 1875. Letter from the Surgeon-General, Indian Medical Department, No. 3793, dated the 31st August 1875( 2 ) 4. The expenditure on Lunatic Asylums was Rs. 88,794, of which Rs. 5,402 were recouped by receipts from patients and value of articles sold. The net cost was, therefore, Rs. 83,392, or about Rs. 150 per head per annum, the average daily strength be- ing 554. This is moderate. The figures for the two preceding years, omitting value of labour for which cash was not received, were Rs. 96,523-7-6 and Rs. 86,208-9-10, while the average strength was only 503 and 527 respectively. The acknowledg- ments of Government are, therefore, due to the Surgeon-General and his Deputies for the attention paid to finance. It is to be no- ticed that the pay of the Superintendent of the Colaba Asylum was reduced during the year, owing to a change of officers. The cost of each lunatic varied from Rs. 84 at Ahmedabad to Rs. 199 at Colaba, where the presence of European patients and other causes, which Dr. Thom explains, makes the average unusually high. 5. The average daily number of lunatics employed was 238.6 against 182.6 in 1873-74. This is a good sign. The increase is especially marked at Poona and Hyderabad, where the failure to provide employment was previously noticed by Government. No improvement is as yet noticed at Dharwar. Dr. Bell's attention should be drawn to the Surgeon-General's remarks on this sub- ject. Government will be glad to sanction machines for washing clothes for the Colaba Asylum, on an estimate being prepared. It will probably be best to apply for only wringing machines and mangles at first ; the other appliances of an English laundry would probably not be suited to, or be appreciated by, the Natives. 6. Government observe that in nearly 50 per cent. of cases the causes of insanity are unknown. Out of a total Asylum popu- lation of 849, insanity is attributed in 146 cases to ganja, in 30 to alcohol, and in 10 to opium. 7. It is satisfactory to notice that the increase from the Colaba workshop was Rs. 170 more than in the previous year. Dr. Murphy's special attention should be given to developing the workshop, as want of space at Colaba prevents much out-door occupation being given. 8. The improvements carried out at the Poona Asylum, and the laying on of Kharakwdsla water, will, as remarked in the Report, afford healthy and abundant employment to the insanes in future. 9. Under the circumstances now represented, Government approve of the proposal to place a wall of sun-dried bricks around
( 3 ) the Cowasj Jehangier Asylum, but all the bricks must be made by the lunatics. It is probable that if this be done, and lunatic labour be available for building the wall, the Superintending Engineer in Sind might be able to carry the work out for a small sum. 10. Government entirely dissent from the opinion that all the annual repairs of the Asylum just mentioned would be executed more cheaply and efficiently by the Superintendent than by the Public Works Department. The Public Works Officers will, no doubt, be glad to leave to the Superintendent such petty repairs as he can carry out with the aid of the patients, as this will lessen the expense to Public Works Funds. 11. His Excellency in Council would wish to hear what steps the Superintendent of the Cowasji Jehangier Asylum proposes taking in regard to the defects mentioned in paragraph 116 of this report. It is useless building plunge-baths if they are not filled. 12. The report, as a whole, shows clearly that with improved management the attractions of Asylums are increasing. The Sur- geon-General observes:( 4 ) 14. In conclusion, Government have pleasure in noticing the favourable account given of Dr. Johnson's management Dr. Holmestead and Dr. Murphy also appear to be doing much good. W. G.

Ahmedabad AsylumNo. S.B./115 OF 1876. FROM THE SURGEON-GENERAL, Indian Medical Department, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, General Department. Bombay, 5th April 1876. SIR, Change of the Year for report. I have the honour to submit the annual report on lunatic asylums in this Presidency and Sind for the year 1875. It is drawn up for the calendar year, agreeably to the orders of the Government of India. This change of the year from the official to the calendar rendered it necessary to include the last three months of the official year 1874-75, notwithstanding they had already been reported on in my last report ; by so doing a complete year can be compared with the preceding one to some extent. Particulars of Population. Remaining from previous year. Re-admitted. Discharged, &c. Deaths. Remained at end of 1875. 2. Proceeding with the Statements, No. 1 shows that during the past year the total population of the asylums was 874, as compared with 849 of the preceding year. Of these 734 were males and 140 females. On 1st January 1875, there were remaining 5462 Percentages. 5. The percentages on the daily average strength were3 The large number of paupers and mendicants gives rise to the question as to how far privation and want are to be considered causes of insanity. Mendicity is, no doubt, very frequently a consequence. Ages. 11. Statements No. 5 show that by far the largest number are between the ages of 20 and 404 No. 9.

5 Average cost per head. The money received from the treasury was Rs. 88,193-11-0, from which the sum paid into the treasury, amounting to Rs. 6,669-13-8, must be de- ducted, leaving the cost to the State Rs. 82,523-13-4, which is a little less than that of last year. The average daily strength was 547.5, and the net cost per head, inclusive of Europeans, was Rs. 148-13-1, less than that of last year by Rs. 1-12-10. The chief item of increase has been contingencies, at Colba and Poona; the next, in establishment, at Ahmedabad ; and in clothing at Poona. A decrease has taken place in the cost of diet, and to a small extent in bazaar medicines. The sum remitted to the treasury exceeded that of last year by Rs. 480 on account of paying patients, and Rs. 786 for manufactures. The actual cost to the State per head in each asylum is :6 Profits. 18. The total credits are increased by Rs. 828, and the excess profit over that of last year is Rs. 507. Condition as regards marriage. 19. Statements No. 12 show that single insanes numbered 374 males and 20 females, making a total of 394 The deaths among these were 33 or 8.6 per cent., whereas last year they were 2.9. The married were 276, males 218 and 58 females ; 20 of the former died and 4 of the latter, or on the whole a precentage of 8.6, the same as last year. There were 45 widowers and 38 widows ; 2 of the former or 4.4 per cent., and 4 of the latter or 1.1 died. Those whose condition was unknown amounted to 97 males and 24 females ; among them the deaths were 12.4 as compared with 7.3 in the previous year. It may be remarked that the unknown have the greatest death rate ; next to them come the single and the married, and the last of all the widowed. The cures were7 General Health of the in- mates. 23. The general health of the inmates has been good, except at Ahmed- abad and Hyderabad, where it was affected by the floods of the year under report and the preceding one, as was to be expected would be the case. It is a matter of regret that one of the inmates of the Ahmedabad Asylum was lost 8 Restraint. 29. I am happy to report that there is no mention of restraint having been resorted to, except at Hyderabad, and in this case it appears to have been of the mildest character 9 COLA'BA ASYLUM. Superintendent.10 treated shows an increase of 19 over the previous year. The rise is altogether due to the greater number of chronic cases remaining from the year 1874. There were consequently also fewer recoveries. The admissions show a decrease of 25 and the re-admissions an increase of 13. The mortality is greater by 5 than the preceding year, owing chiefly to the presence of cholera. Daily Average Strength. 7. The daily average strength was males 212.7, females 48.311 males died and there remain at the end of the year 49 males and 3 females12 General Health. 18. The general health of the patients has not been particularly good. The total treated for bodily diseases shows an increase of 136 as compared with the preceding year13 from the realized value of labour, viz., Rs. 721-12-3, the balance, Rs. 199-3-6, is the actual cash profit, against Rs. 170 in the previous year. Receipts and Expenditure. 21. The actual amount received from the treasury was Rs. 51,412-8-6, showing a decrease of Rs. 5,875-12-2, as compared with the preceding year. The decrease is owing to a reduction in the extras of establishment, of diets, and to a less consumption in clothing, the cost of clothing having been calculated similar to last year on the actually worn out and condemned articles. The sum of Rs. 4,844-15-8 was paid into the treasury. The net expenditure was, therefore, Rs. 46,567-8-10. Average Cost of each Patient. 22. The actual cost for each patient was Rs. 178-6-8, showing a decrease of Rs. 21-0-8 as compared with the previous year. The cost of each patient in relation to estab- lishment was Rs. 89-14-1, in relation to diets Rs. 66-15-3, to clothing Rs. 8-12-7, and to contingencies Rs. 30-4-0. The contingencies show an increase of Rs. 6-6-9 per patient, as compared with the previous year. This is partly owing to a change in the mode of supply of stationary from monthly to annually, causing a larger balance on hand, partly to a larger amount of disinfectants having been expended, but chiefly to the increased cost of water, amounting to Rs. 1,241-2-5 over the previous year. 23. The conduct of the establishment has been in every respect most satisfactory. POONA ASYLUM. Superintendent14 plied by the Executive Engineer of the station, it has been calculated that, allowing 1,200 cubic feet for males and 1,000 for females, the asylum can now contain 61 males and 17 females, being an increase of accommodation for 14 males and 5 females. Plates, with the information required in paragraph 74 of the General Asylum Rules, have been printed and affixed over each ward door. Water Supply. 4. The arrangements for the Khurrukwasla water supply have been completed during the year. In addition to the four standing taps, a stone masonry tank with paved flagging outside has been built round two of them15 Percentage of Cures. 9. The percentage of cures in males on the average daily strength was 11.6, or an increase of 7.4 over the previous year. On admissions it was 26.3 or an increase of 10.9. In females the case was different. The percentage of cures on their average daily strength was 16.9 or a decrease of 11.4 compared with last year ; on admis- sions it was 33.3 or a decrease of 16.7 compared with 1874. Of the seven recoveries 4 occurred in the male admissions, one in the males of the remained, one amongst the female admissions, and one amongst remained females. Diseases Cured of Admis- sions. 10. The diseases cured during the year were as follows:16 Age of patients. 16. Form No. 5 shews that out of the 25 admissions, 16 (or 24 per cent.) were between 20 and 40 years old ; 6 between 40 and 60 ; 2 were under 20, and 1 upwards of 60. Of the 16 between 20 and 40 years, 8 males and 3 females were admitted on account of dementia. Of the 6 between 40 and 60 1 was an imbecile, 1 was paralytic, 1 had acute mania, and 2 were cases of dementia. No females were admitted under this latter head. The two admissions under 20 years were females, one suffering from melancholia and the other dementia. The one case above 60 was a female admitted on account of acute mania. Types of Insanity. 17. Form No. 6 exhibits in detail the types of insanity of those admitted and treated during the year. Out of 77 treated, 30 were on account of acute mania; of these 25 were males and 5 were females. Of chronic mania cases there were 21 treated, of whom 16 were males and 5 females. There were 4 cases of melancholia, 2 males and 2 females. Twelve (10 males and 2 females) were treated on account of acute dementia. One male was admitted for paralysis. There were 3 cases of amentia, one a male, and two were females. One male was treated for mania intermittent. There were 4 cases of monomania, three being males and one female, and one male was treated for imbecility. Causes of Insanity. 18. Out of the 77 treated, the cause of insanity was known only in 13. Amongst these, 9 were from physical causes and 4 from moral. Of the causes known to be physical 7 were from the use of ganja, one from alcohol, and one was a case of puerpe- ral mania. Of the moral causes two were the results of grief ; one followed a fit of extreme anger, and one was hereditary. Escapes. 19. There was only one escape. A man aged 20 effected it at night in consequence of the unfinished condition of the com- pound wall close to the ward, and which happened at the time to be under annual repair. The lad, whilst the warder's back was turned, evaded observation, cleared the broken wall, and has never since been heard of. Management. 20. The behaviour of the lunatics has, on the whole, been extremely good. With discretion, kindness and tact they are easily managed. Especial care is taken that neither violence nor ill temper is exhibited by any of the warders or people in charge, and mechanical restraint has not been found necessary in a single instance. General Health. 21. The general health of the patients has been excellent. With the exception of one cholera case, which occurred in the month of August, no infectious disease appeared. Bodily Almens. 22. At the end of the year there were two remaining under treatment for bodily ailments, one being a case of general dropsy and the other abscess over the sternum. There were 16 admissions during the year, 10 being males and 6 females. Of the 10 male admissions 1 was a case of hemiplegia, 1 of epilepsy, 1 of general paralysis, 3 of diarrh17 Amongst the females one death took place from cholera maligna, and another from hydrophobia. This latter was of a very distressing nature. The woman had been admitted whilst 5 months pregnant, only 24 days before the first appearance of the disease. At the time of admission it was ascer- tained from the police that three months previously she had been bitten in the arm by a mad dog. The symptoms of the disease set in on the 19 th of December and continued with unremitting violence until the 21st, when she died exhausted. Cost of each Patient. 24. The cost of each patient amounted to Rs. 164-12-4 which, com- pared with last year, is in excess by Rs. 30-12-2. This increased expenditure is owing to the item of Rs. 920-5-0 on account of clothing. Garden and Labour. 25. Form No. 11 shews the receipts and expenditure on account of manufactures; but as realizations in this asylum have as yet only been effected on account of garden and labour products, these only have been given. The garden grows lucern, vegetables, and fruit trees, the production of which is known to be saleable. The total credit as per value of plants and machinery was Rs. 215-11-1. The total sum expended in purchase of plants, seeds, and implements was Rs. 128-10-2. The actual amount realized on account of garden sales was Rs. 81-1-10, and on account of grinding labour Rs. 51-13-3, making a total of Rs. 132-15-1. The balance in hand on 1st January 1875 was Rs. 82-12-0. Adding these two sums and deducting expenditure leaves a balance of Rs. 87-0-11 remitted to the Government Treasury. On the 31st December 1875 no sum remained in hand. Employment of Lunatics. 26. The average number of male lunatics employed was 37 and females 8. Up to the present time no attempt has been made to carry out the instructions of Government convey- ed in rules 63 and 64 of the Government General Rules, the males having chiefly been employed in gardening, and assisting in the annual repairs of the building, so far as the removal of debris from the premises. 27. The female lunatics are employed solely in grinding grain. An unsuccessful attempt to teach them spinning was made, but on its being- found impossible to induce them to give the necessary care and attention to learn, it had to be abandoned. Condition as to marriage and caste. 28. Among the remained on the 1st January 1875 who were single, there were males 25 and females 4, total 29. Of married, 11 were males and 4 were females, total 15. There were 5 widowers and 3 widows. Of the 25 admissions during the year 8 were single males and 1 was a single female. Of the married 8 were males and 2 were females, total 10. There was 1 widower. Of unknown condition, 2 males and 3 females were admitted during the year. DHARWAR ASYLUM. Superintendent.18 females, with a small court-yard attached to each, for the purposes of ablu- tion (which operation is conducted in the open air, there being no bath-rooms) as well as for air and exercise, in which are situated privies for each sex; in addition there are 18 cells, each 12 feet long, 10 feet broad and 11 feet high, containing 1,350 cubic feet of air; two of the cells are padded for refractory patients ; cells and wards are all well ventilated. The accommodation, however, is insufficient for the wants of the District, and is especially felt in regard to cells, many applications being annually refused for this reason. Extra day-rooms, too, are much required for the treatment and reception of patients partially recovered, an important consideration in the recovery of lunatics, instead of being compelled, as at present, to mix with those who give vent to obscene and foul expressions and revel in nudity and filthy habits. Capacity. 2. The asylum, strictly speaking, affords space for only 18 lunatics, that being the actual number of cells at my com- mand to secure them in at night, in the absence of dormitories; but as all are not dangerous characters, with management and by allowing some of the more rational and quiet of both sexes to sleep in the day-rooms, with their keepers, as many as 24 have been accommodated at one time. Inmates. 3. The total number of inmates in the asylum during the past year was 27. Of those 8 were new admissions (6 males and 2 females) 3 were discharged cured (two admit- ted in August 1874, and one in September 1875), and one lunatic, admitted in July 1875, had so far recovered that at the request of his friends and on the sanction of the visitors, he was removed to his own house. Two lunatics died, one from atrophy and general debility, the other from acute bronchitis and tubercular deposit in lungs, leaving 21 remaining, 15 males and 6 females; of whom 15 were cases of mania, 12 in males and 3 in females; and 10 of dementia, 7 in males and 3 in females. 4. The alleged cause being attributable to ganja 2 cases, fever in 1, grief in 3, and in 21 the cause is unknown. 5. There were no criminal lunatics in the asylum. General Health. 6. The health of the inmates has been very good. Only 3 were admitted on the sick list, 1 a case of diarrh19 engaged on in-door work, such as grinding grain, or industry of any descrip- tion, as may be seen by a reference to Form No. 4. No Paying Patients. 9. None of the inmates were in a position to pay for maintenance in the asylum. Garden Supplies, &c. 10. The garden supplies an ample quantity of vegetable for the use of the lunatics, Rs. 52-11-8 being the value of those supplies during the year, at about 5 ounces per head per diem, and the present amount of ground under culture is sufficient for present wants. I still maintain, as in my last report, that there is no certain market for the sale of vegetables, notwithstanding the town of Dharwar possessing a large native population, few of whom care for any but native vegetables, of which they have abundance in their own market, against which we could not possibly compete. Through giving due publicity, how- ever, to the residents, I have been able to realize and pay into the treasury Rs. 121-15-0 (one hundred and twenty-one rupees fifteen annas), on the proceeds of the garden, Rs. 42-5-3 on the actual sale of garden products, and Rs. 79-9-9 through economy in working the garden. AHMEDABAD ASYLUM. Superintendent.20 Mortality. 4. There were 12 deaths. This large mortality was due to exceptional causes. Cholera, which had so long been kept out of the asylum by precautionary and sanitary measures, while epidemic in the city in its immediate vicinity, carried off one female; 4 males died after removal from the asylum, in consequence of the floods, from the effects of exposure and damp, and also from the severe shock which their feeble nervous organizations received on this occasion21 included under the former heading. She, naturally of feeble and irresponsible intelligence, killed her child without apparent cause. She has been perfectly quiet and docile since her confinement in the asylum, but is decidedly silly, The only one who has shown any violent tendencies was the escaped lunatic22 18. As it is in the early stages of mental disease that we must look for successful results, the small number of recoveries is accounted for by the large preponderance of chronic cases, the greater proportion of which is hope- lessly incurable. Causes of Insanity. 19. This is a subject on which very meagre information has hitherto been obtained, and there is much difficulty in arriving at a satisfactory solution of the question. Out of a popu- lation of 132, the causes said to have been ascertained were 82, and those totally unknown 50. Seventy-two are attributed to physical and 10 to moral causes. Of the former, abuse of ganja, epilepsy and hereditary account for the largest number of cases; and among the latter, religion seems to play the chief part. Sick in Hospital. 20. There is no hospital. The patients are treated in their cells. There were 43 admissions which, with 1 case remaining at the close of the year, make a total of 44; of these 32 were discharged and 12 died. Percentages of Sickness and Mortality. 21. The daily average number of sick was 2.6 and the death rate to treated was in the proportion of 27.3 per cent. Cash Account. 22. The total cash received from the treasury was Rs. 14,227-7-2. The receipts on account of patients who contributed in full or in part towards their own maintenance were Rs. 909-3-9. The value of vegetables sold and of grain ground, which was received in cash, was Rs. 361-10-4. These three items are bona fide cash receipts, but the fourth, viz., the value of ''garden produce consumed by the lunatics," amounting to Rs. 120, is merely a paper adjustment. The total receipts, including the last, are Rs. 15,618-5-3. Increase. 23. With regard to expenditure a large increase appears in the state- ment on account of " establishment." This is explained by the fact that back allowances, amounting to Rs. 2,587-1-7 from December 1872, sanctioned under Government Resolu- tion No. 948, of 16th March last, to my predecessors, and the addition of Rs. 100 per mensem to my own salary from 28th January to 31st December 1875, viz., Rs. 1,112-14-5, were paid during the year, and a further augmenta- tion has taken place in consequence of a barber and watchman having been sanctioned as part of the permanent establishment, on whose account Rs. 93-9-7 were drawn during the year. 24. There is another item of Rs. 58-8-0 shewn under column 11 of Statement 11, which will be found explained in paragraph 30. The total increase thus amounts to Rs. 3,852-1-7. 25. There is also some increase under the head of diet and bazaar medicines caused by the value of vegetables and tobacco consumed by the lunatics being now included under the former heading for the first time, and owing also to the unusual sickness on account of cholera and the floods. On these two items the increase amounts to Rs. 143-14-2.
23 Average gross and net Cost per head. 26. In consequence of the increase noted above there has, of neces- sity, arisen a corresponding increase in the average cost; the gross cost per patient was Rs. 129-12-11, and the net cost Rs. 118-3-4. This is the result after deducting the receipts. Receipts and Expenditure on account of Garden reali- zation. 27. There are no manufactures carried on in the asylum. The only source of income is the realized value of vegetables sold and of grain grinding. Population to Average Number employed. 28. Out of a mean population of 109.6, the average number employed was 77.7; this gives an increase of 6.1 over the previous year's average. I have specially directed my attention to increasing the number of employed, particularly on out-door labour ; but my endeavours have failed, simply from the fact that all the available intelligence had already been utilized, the number unemployed representing those only who are totally incapable of doing any serviceable work. Credits or Annual Income. 29. The credits during the year are represented by Rs. 1,688-2-2. This is made up of two items, viz., cash received or realized, value of garden produce and grinding grain, Rs. 744-9-10, and unrealized value of goods made over for asylum purposes, Rs. 943-8-4, consisting of vegetables and tobacco consumed by the lunatics, grain, grass and kurbee for the bullocks, and also garden improvements. Debits or Annual Expen- diture. 30. The debits amount to Rs. 1,326-7-10. This sum consists of two items, viz., Rs. 943-8-4, being the value of plant in store at the close of the year, and Rs. 382-15-6, representing all charges on raw materials, &c. Deducting the debits from the credits the annual financial result is Rs. 361-10-4 in favour of the asylum. These figures shew a decrease on the previous year's opera- tions of Rs. 133-0-9, partly owing to Rs. 58-8-0 on account of indulgences supplied to deserving and working patients under Asylum Rules LXIV. and CIX. having been debited to this account for the first time, (it had hitherto been met from a charitable source now no longer available,) and also to the fact that the garden was laid waste by the floods and the grain and vegetable crops almost entirely destroyed at a critical period. Condition of the Lunatics as to marriage, age and caste. 31. At the close of the year there remained 43 single, 1 of whom was a female; 38 married, 8 being females; 12 widowed, 6 being females; 17 whose condition was not known, of whom 3 were females, making a total of 110. Seven single lunatics were admitted, all males ; 12 married, of whom 3 were females; and 3 males, whose condition was not known. Five cures occurred among the single males, 1 among the married females, 1 was a widower, and the condition of 2 males was unknown. One of the married females was transferred to friends but " not improved.'' Two married males escaped. Five of the single died, 6 of the married, and 1 of the unknown class. 32. With respect to caste there were 40 single Hindoos, 39 males and 1 female; 41 married, 30 males and 11 females; 8 widowed, 5 males and 3 females; and 16 whose condition was unknown, 13 males and 3 females24 33. The largest number of deaths occurred amongst the married, and of cures among the single. 34. I have avoided as much as possible making any comparison with the results recorded in the report for 1874-75, inasmuch as those for the three first months of that year are repeated in the present report, on account of the substitution of the calendar for the official year. Escapes. 35. Two escapes have taken place during the year25 ten days there was great fear for the crops. Fortunately, the river rose again, and the greater part was saved. The very high inundation of the preceding year told unfavourably on the health of the lunatics all through this year. Towards the close of the year Government sanctioned the building of a wall around the grounds. This has now been commenced, everything so far being found by the establishment, sun-dried bricks, mud, and water alone being required. At the commencement of the year a rough earthen boundary was raised all round, partly by lunatic labour and partly by prison labour. This boundary varies from five to seven feet in height; the wall now being built is on this. Garden. 3. The garden is yearly improving. Buildings, &c. 4. The asylum buildings remain unaltered, with the exception that the raised sleeping places have all been removed. The Public Works Department have removed the two iron pumps from the well supplying the bathing tank, and have fixed an excellent Persian wheel; so the well and bathing tank are again in constant use. The tank was also improved by the Public Works Department, by being raised and coated with Portland cement. Water Supply. 5. Four wells supply the asylum with sufficient water. By a rather careful analysis this year, it was found that the water was about the best in use anywhere hereabouts. Drainage. 6. Drainage is good. We should be glad of a greater rain-fall. One good storm did fall to our lot and did an immense amount of good to the trees, new boundary embank- ment, paths and garden generally. Clothing, Food, &c. 7. The clothing has been better this year. It was all procured from the District Jail; if coarser, it was much stronger and better adapted to our wants than what had previously been supplied by contract. The food has been unaltered; for men who work hard a little extra is given in the shape of milk curd or butter milk; the same to the weak and ailing. Accommodation. 8. The accommodation is ample. The barracks, being built on the Government standard plan, with open ridged tile roofs, are very hot in the hot season. The difference made in temperature between this and an ordinary flat roof is 10; it is certainly a mistake to have the same standard plan for the whole of this vast and varied peninsula. Conservancy. 9. The conservancy is good. Admissions. 10. During the year there were 64 new admissions, 5 females and 59 males (of the latter 13 were criminals). Of these 38 were Mussalmans, 24 were Hindoos and 2 Native Christians. Thirty-six were discharged, 2 were females and 34 were males (of the latter 5 were criminals). Of those discharged 29 had been less than one year in the asylum and two had been less than two years. Sickness, Deaths, &c. 11. There has been a considerable amount of sickness, chiefly fever, dysentery, and general weakness, often accompanied with dropsy. There were 17 casualties, being 3 more than last year; less by 1 than the year 1871-72, and the same number as B 66726 in 1872-73. One female died and 1 criminal. One of the deaths occurred five minutes after admission. This man was struck down by sun-stroke on the road to the asylum; and two others; who were old and weak, died soon after their admission. One case died suddenly from apoplexy, another suddenly from heart disease, and 10 died from bowel disorder. Remaining. 12. There are now remaining 16 females and 92 males ; of these latter 20 are criminals. During the year there was only 1 re-admission. Vaccination. 13. Forty-five have been vaccinated27 of the inmates do some work,ANNUAL STATEMENTS.

B 66758 No. 13Annual Reports (Lunatic Asylums). No. 1593. GENERAL DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 20th May 1876. Letter from the Surgeon General, Indian Medical Department, No. S.B.-145, dated the 1st May 187660 Rs. 199 per head to Rs. 178, which is creditable to the Superinten- dent, Dr. Murphy, as the well-being and comfort of the inmates was in no way diminished. In Ahmedabad the cost rose from Rs. 84 to Rs. 118 per head, but this is in a great measure owing to the floods there in the monsoon. 5.The average daily number of employed lunatics has risen this year from 238 to 277, and though the nature of their employ- ment cannot of course be remunerative, still the benefit to the in- sanes is marked. The chief occupations of those employed were gardening by males and grinding corn by females, though in Colaba, owing to Dr. Murphy's care and discretion, most of the tailoring work of the establishment was done by insanes, and a certain amount of basket and mat making accomplished, while at Hyderabad, the patients having made bricks, are now engaged in assisting to build a wall round the grounds. 6.Ventilation and conservancy have been carefully attended to, and, except at Colaba, the water supply has been excellent. Till the Tulsi water scheme is accomplished an improvement at Colaba can hardly be expected. 7.His Excellency the Governor in Council has much pleasure in recording his satisfaction with the diligence and zealous care be- stowed on the inmates of the asylums by Drs. Murphy, Holmested, and Wiehe, while the careful inspections made by Dr. Wyllie are what might have been expected from that officer's well known interest in, and long connexion with, the treatment of lunatics at the Ahmedabad Asylum. 8.To Dr. Thom thanks are due for his concise and excellent report, which gives all the information which Government would desire to have.

FROM THE SURGEON-GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, TO THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, GENERAL DEPARTMENT. Bombay, 14th March 1877. SIR, I have the honour to submit, for the information of His Excellency the Governor in Council, the Annual Report on the Lunatic Asylums of this Presidency and Sind for the year 1876. Population. 2.Taking the statements first, No. 1 shows that during the past year the total asylum population was 846 as compared with 874 for the preceding year, a decrease of 28. Of Admissions and Re-ad- missions. this total 697 were males and 149 females. On the 1st January 1876 there remained 464 males and 104 females, a total of 568 ; and there were admitted during the year 223 males and 41 females, a total of 264. The re-admissions Discharged. were 10 males and 4 females. The lunatics discharged numbered 228, and of these 200 were males and 28 females; ninety left cured2 Percentages. 5.The percentages to the daily average strength were 3 recovered, 2 improved, and 4 died. For melancholia 60 cases were treated ; 2 of them recovered, 1 improved, and 2 died. Of acute dementia 58 cases remained and 68 were admitted ; while of chronic 68 remained, and 28 were ad- mitted. The recoveries were 20 from acute, and 4 from chronic dementia ; 7 of the acute and 4 of the chronic form improved ; and the deaths for each were 5 and 6, respectively. Twenty-four idiots remained, and 6 were admitted ; 8 imbeciles were treated. Of the other types treated, namely amentia, mania, and dementia complicated with epilepsy, 14 remained and 6 were admitted. Causes of Insanity. 11.Statements No. 7 show the alleged causes of insanity so far as they can be ascertained. Amongst physical causes ganja accounts for 147 cases, alcohol for 40, and opium for 10. Fever is said to have been the exciting cause in 12 cases ; 23 are due to a previous mental attack ; 36 are hereditary and congenital; starva- tion accounts for 18 ; epilepsy for 27 ; and disorders of parturition for 6 ; 9 are set down to injuries of the head ; and 10 to the effects of climate. Of moral causes grief accounts for 52 cases ; 4 are attributed to fright, 4 to study, and 10 to religious excitement. The total number ascertained to be due to physical causes is 343, and to moral causes, 704 CASH ACCOUNT of the Lunatic Asylums of the Bombay Presidency for the Year 1876 RECEIPTS. EXPENDITURE. Items.

Through some unaccountable oversight the deductions on account of European soldier lunatics were not included in the statements for 1875, so that the figures given for that year will require correction. They should stand thus :6 Manufactures. 15.Statements No.11 show the receipts and expenditure on account of manufactures. The total credit for the year under report amounts to Rs. 4,503-9-1, being an excess of profit of Rs. 2,161-0-2, and an excess profit over that of the preced- ing year of Rs. 760-2-6, the figures showing the total credit and the excess profit for the latter year were Rs. 3,720-2-11, and Rs. 1,400-13-8, respectively. Number of Insanes em- ployed. 16.In the following table a comparison is made of the daily average number of insanes employed in each asylum during the past two years. From this it will be seen that there is a total increase for 1876 of 47.7, and that the increase for Colaba alone was 45.2 ; the numbers employed at the other asylums remaining almost the same as before :7 The conditions of the principal castes as regards marriage were :8 Accommodation. 22.The accommodation at Ahmedabad and Hyderabad was abundant ; that for female lunatics at Poona and for both sexes at Dharwar is said to be insufficient for the wants of those districts. The overcrowded state of Colaba Asylum has been the sub- ject of frequent complaints, and I have repeatedly brought it to the notice of Government during the past year. The evil is increasing annually through the accumulation of chronic cases9 with their crimes, and in this way incite them to violence, thus, in many cases, rendering nugatory all efforts in the direction of treatment. The presence, too, in an asylum of a large number of confirmed lunatics has a very unfavourable influence on the treatment of those who may be susceptible of cure, especially when all are so crowded together as they are at Colaba; but here, in addition, so large a proportion of the inmates are incurables that but little scope is left for treatment at all. Dr. Murphy finds that considerable benefit accrues from keeping those who are fit for it at steady, suitable employment in the workshops, and he has also found that abolishing the system of seclusion, to a great extent, in the treatment of violent lunatics has been attended with very satisfactory results. The higher percentage of cases amongst the married insanes, as shown in the first table in paragraph 17, is noticeable; the low percentage amongst the " unknown" is probably due to the fact that most of the insanes coming under this category are cases found wandering in the streets and elsewhere, and in whom their disease is of long standing. The percentage of cures to daily average strength has, as might be expected, undergone no increase, but has, on the contrary, declined. During the year under report the figures were 15.3, while those for the preceding year were 16.6. Employment. 26.The rate at which the number of insanes employed at Colaba increases annually is very satisfactory, and highly creditable to the efforts of the Superintendent. At the other asylums the numbers do not differ from those of last year. Dr. Holmested gives a most favourable account of the manner in which he has utilized the labour of the inmates at Hyderabad. The Superintendent at Poona remarks on the beneficial results, to both body and mind, from healthy employment; and he mentions the success which has attended his efforts towards the cultivation of the asylum compound by means of lunatic labour. The value of healthy work, as a curative agent, cannot be over-estimated, to say nothing of the desirability of encouraging it as a means towards lessening expense. Restraint. 27.Restraint, if it may be called so, has been needed only in two cases, both violent maniacs. At Colaba one of these was successfully treated by his being placed in handcuffs and allowed to move about ; the other case of restraint, at Hyderabad, was no more than solitary confinement in a large ward. Escapes. 28.Two escapes are recorded10 Visitors. 31.The visitors, so far as can be ascertained from the reports, have been regular in their attendance. Commendations. 32.I have much pleasure in cordially endorsing the favourable terms in which the Superintendents are spoken of by the Deputy Surgeons-General. Dr. Hunter commends the strict supervision exercised at Colaba by Dr. Murphy, and the zeal and attention with which he performs the important duties entrusted to him. The other Superintendents, more particularly Drs. Wiehe and Holmested, are also deserving of every praise for the efficient manner in which the work of their asylums is conducted. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, WM. THOM, Surgeon-General.
11 COLABA ASYLUM. Superintendent12 Details of Treated. 5.The subjoined statement exhibits the princi- pal details of the patients treated for the year :13 Types of Insanity. 10.Out of a total of 457 treated, 232, or 50 per cent., were suffering from mania14 cases, entirely abolished, and with satisfactory results. It was found that patients who are steadily confined to their rooms under fits of excitement become more violent, destructive, and filthy, and the fits more prolonged than when allowed their freedom. In only a single instance were we obliged to have recourse to restraint. This was in the case of an able-bodied man who had been in the asylum nearly five years, suffering from recurrent mania of the most violent kind ; and, in order to prevent him from injuring himself and others, he used to be regularly confined to his room during the fit, which usually lasted from 15 to 20 days in each month, handcuffs being substitut- ed for seclusion. He was allowed to go about along with other patients in the refractory yard. The fits soon wore off, and he is now in a fair way towards recovery. Causes of Insanity. 15.In the total treated the proportion of known causes was 236 to 221 unknown, or 51.6 to 48.3 per cent., which is about the usual rate. The known causes are detailed in Statement No. 7, and are divided into two classes, the physical and moral. The former class greatly preponderates over the latter class, and is in the propor- tion of 202 to 34. Of the physical causes 42 per cent. are attributed to intoxicants. In 15 males and 8 females the predisposition left from previous attacks caused relapse ; hereditary taint was found to exist, and was supposed to be the chief exciting cause in 14 males and 2 females ; epilepsy was the active agent in 16 males and 1 female; congenital weakness of mind occur- red in 6 males and 1 female. The insanity of 6 males and 1 female is attributed to fever; of 7 males and 11 females to starvation; 9 males and 1 female to climate; 8 males to injury to head; 1 male to syphilis; 1 male to sudden shock ; 1 male to brain disease ; and disorders of parturi- tion were the exciting causes in 6 females. Of the moral causes domestic troubles were those most frequently assigned, and were the causes in 17 males and 6 females. Religious excitement was assigned as a cause in 4 males, study in 4 males, and fright in 3 males. Criminal Lunatics. 16.There were 65 criminals15 18.The following are the details of the working account:16 the month is about 51,270 gallons, for which the Irrigation Department charges monthly Rs. 26-13-4, or Rs. 322 per annum Drainage. 5.The drainage of the asylum is surface, and is sufficient to prevent the collection and stagnation of monsoon water. Conservancy. 6.The dry-earth system of conservancy is carried out with as much attention to details as is compatible with the feeble in- telligence and habits of the patients. Part of the nightsoil is buried in trenches in the garden during the cold and hot sea- sons, and, when completely deodorized and pulverized, is afterwards utilized as manure. Details of Treated. 7.On the 1st January 1876 there remained in the asylum 54, of whom 42 were males and 12 females. There were admitted during the year 28 males and 6 females, who, with one male re-admitted, make a total of 35 admissions. The total population was thus 8917 Previous Employment of Lunatics. 14.Among those admitted during the past year 1 was a police constable, 1518 expenditure as calculated per patient, but especially to a decrease in the cost of clothing and contingencies. On account of diets the net expenditure was somewhat greater than in the previous year, but the expenditure per patient was less than in 1875. Cost per Patient. 20.The average cost per patient was Rs. 145-2-8, or less by Rs. 22-0-5 than in 1875. A great diminution will be observed, on referring to Form 9, in the cost per head under each item of expenditure during the past year. Owing to the increase in the number of patients, the cost of establishment per patient shows a very marked decrease. Numbers employed. 21.The average number of lunatics employed during the year was 4819 separation of patients who are partially recovered from others who are filthy in their habits, or noisy and obscene. This want will probably be supplied on the removal of the Civil Hospital to the Fort, which measure is in con- templation, and will enable the present Civil Hospital to be utilized for the above purpose. Capacity. 2.The asylum is capable of accommodating 18 patients, if strict regard were paid to the number of sleeping cells only; but by making use of the day-wards as sleeping quarters for a few of the quieter patients, as many as 24 have been under treatment at one time. Inmates. 3.The number of lunatics remaining on the 31st December 1875 was 21, and 4 have been admitted during the year. One patient was discharged from the asylum in the month of June and placed in charge of his friends with the sanction of the Asylum Committee. The actual number under treatment during the past year has been 25, and the number remaining on the 31st December 1876 was 24. Of these 14 were cases of mania, 9 of dementia, and 2 of imbecility. Causes of Insanity. 4.In 19 patients the cause of insanity is unknown : of the remainder the cause of insanity was as follows :20 have been saved by economy in the management of the garden, making a total of Rs. 156-4-4 paid into the Treasury to the credit of Government, against Rs. 121-15-0 paid in on a similar account during the previous year. The demand for English vegetables by the public has been only slightly greater than formerly, the majority of the European residents having gar- dens of their own, and the native inhabitants being able to procure country vegetables at a cheaper rate in the bazaar. Recommendations. 11.The enlargement of the present asylum by the addition of extra day-wards on the removal of the Civil Hospital to the Fort. The substitution of earth for stone in the flooring of the 9 sleeping cells which are now paved with the latter material, the former being found more cleanly and more conducive to the health of the patients. AHMEDABAD ASYLUM. Superintendent.21 26th August 1877, in which the " police authorities " are " warned that there is at present great scarcity of accommodation, and desired to be more careful in sending lunatics to the asylums." Daily Average Strength. 6.The daily average strength was 105.6, against 109.6 during 1875, Of the former 87.8 represents the average strength of males, and 17.8 of females. Daily Sick. 7.The daily average sick was 1.1 males and 0.8 females22 The districts of Ahmedabad furnished 5, of Surat and Kaira 4 each, and of Broach 1 of the admissions. In the previous year patients were received from Kattywar, Mahi Knta, Konkan, Hindustan, Malwa, Marwar, &c.; but during the period under report they have been entirely restricted to the four districts abovenamed,23 this head having been exceptional, as explained in my last Report. There is also a small decrease in the cost of " Diet" and " Bazaar Medicines," amount- ing to Rs. 84-7-1. Increase. 21.There was a small increase in " Clothing," amounting only to Rs. 1-10-11; but as a large rope-matting for the visi- tors' room, amounting to Rs. 62, is included under this head, there has in reality been a decrease in the actual clothing charges. Under contingencies the increase is also small, viz., Rs. 38-11-2, due to repairs to the asylum and purchase of articles of dead stock. Average Gross and Net Cost. 22.The gross cost per head was Rs. 111-3-1, and the net cost Rs. 97-11-4; these results show an improvement on the previous year's figures, which stood at Rs. 129-11-6 and Rs. 118-3-4, respectively. There has, therefore, been a saving of Rs. 18-8-4 in the gross, and of Rs. 20-7-10 in the net cost per head during the year under report. Receipts and Expendi- ture on account of Garden. 23.The gross garden realizations, including the value of labour in grain grinding paid by the contractor, have been Rs. 958-9-6 ; deducting from this amount the cost incidental to garden operations, the net receipts are represented by Rs. 573-15-3, being Rs. 212-4-11 in excess of those for 1875. Population to Average Number employed. 24.The mean population was 105.6, and the average number employed 77.2 ; these figures differ but little from those of the previous year. That there has been no increase in the number of employed is due to the fact that among the admissions there have not been more than 5 fit for employment, and among the discharged we have lost several useful able-bodied patients. Credits or Annual Income. 25.The cash receipts during the year, on account of garden vege- tables and the grain ground by the patients, amount to Rs. 958-9-6, and the unrealized value of other produce, such as crops of jowari, grass, &c., for the cattle, and the value also of garden improvements and repairs, such as levelling, draining, repair of hedges, &c., are represented by Rs. 730-8-7. The annual income may, therefore, be put down at Rs 1,689-2-1, which is slightly in excess of the previous year's figures, and with a smaller population. Debits or Annual Expend- iture. 26.The debits during the year were Rs. 1,115-2-10. This sum is made up of two items, viz., Rs. 730-8-7 on account of plant and machinery in store, and Rs. 384-10-3 for raw materials purchased and all other charges. The pro- fits or excess of credits over debits amount to Rs. 573-15-3. This is in ex- cess of the previous year's profit by Rs. 212-4-11 ; the financial results are, therefore, satisfactory. Condition as to Marriage, Age, and Caste. 27. Out of the 108 patients who remained in the asylum at the be- ginning of the year, 40 were " single," 40 " married," 11 " widowed," and there were 17 whose condition was unknown. Of the admissions 4 were single, 3 males and 1 female; 5 were married, all males; 2 were widows; and the condi- tion of 324 married males had shown no improvement. One single male escaped. This patient had recovered, and would have been discharged at the next meeting of visitors. No attempt was, therefore, made to apprehend him. Of the 4 patients who died 2 were single males, and the condition of the remaining 225 SIR COWASJI JEHANGIER LUNATIC ASYLUM, HYDERABAD. Superintendent.26 Accommodation, 8.The accommodation has been more than sufficient. No alterations are needed. Conservancy. 9.The conservancy is good and effective. Admissions. 10.During the year there were 45 new admissions27 Employment and Amuse- ment. 19.All are encouraged to work, and often a little extra is allowed them as milk or curd, especially to the weak; the best prognosis we have is their willingness to work. We also try to amuse them and let them play a few drums and other instruments.Sir Cowasji has promised me a musical box, which will also be a diversion. Cost. 20.The total cost of the asylum has been Rs. 10,920-4-2, and the cost per patient Rs. 98-8-8, somewhat more than during the previous year, chiefly owing to the Superintend- ent's salary being more for the past nine months. Rs. 55 were paid into the treasury on account of paying patients, and Rs. 223 from sale of garden pro- duce ; this is less than was realized during the previous year. In addition is the value of the work, as detailed above, executed by the lunatics, and which would have cost a large sum had it been left to the Public Works Department; their estimate for a part of the work was Rs. 2,000. Daily Average Inmates. 21.The daily average has been 108 ; and the establishment, all told, number 28 persons. Mr. Mendes, the Hospital Assistant, and the 21 warders generally have all worked well.

Criminal lunatics during this year, and one previous. B 864Annual Reports. No. 1526. GENERAL DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 14th May 1877. Letter from the Acting Surgeon General, Indian Medical Department, No. s. B. 139, dated 30th April 1877( 2 ) about Rs. 2,541 more than in 1875. The average cost of each lunatic was Rs. 143, as compared with Rs. 148 in the previous year, the greatest reduc- tion being in Poona and Ahmedabad, in which latter place however the cost, Rs. 97, is not so low as in 1874, when it was but Rs. 84. 5.The total credit and profit on employment and manufactures has somewhat increased, but Government do not look to the gain financially so much as to the great benefit derived by the lunatics from employment. The large increase in the number of insanes employed at Colaba is creditable to Dr. Murphy. The occupations provided are much the same at all asylums as last year, except in Hyderabad, where the inmates of the asylum have built two good walls, and constructed four latrines for which the commenda- tion of Government is due to Dr. Holmested. Some noteworthy statistics are given in Statement No. 12 and paragraph 17 of the report regarding the percentages of cures and mortality among married and unmarried patients respectively. 6.Ventilation, drainage, and conservancy call for no remark except at Colaba. The condition of the ground floors of the old buildings there is deplorable, and no doubt is one of the chief causes of the excessive sickness from fever and dysentry at that asylum. Paragraph 11 of Dr. Murphy's report should be sent to the Public Works Department for early considera- tion as to the best means of remedying the state of affairs therein depicted. Government in the General Department would also call attention to the 22nd paragraph of the Surgeon General's report. Mr. Crawford's proposals to build an asylum at Ratngiri were unfortunately negatived for want of funds this year, but the absence of accommodation at Colaba is so apparent that some such scheme must be undertaken at the earliest opportunity. An asylum at Ratngiri will be very much cheaper to maintain than one in Bom- bay, and though Dr. Murphy says the relief will be but temporary, sufficient land might be taken up at Ratngiri to provide for the future enlargement of the asylum when required. 7.In conclusion His Excellency the Governor in Council has much pleasure in recognising the services of Drs. Murphy, Wiehe and Holmested, and has to thank Dr. Thom for his clear and concise report. E. W. RAVENSCROFT, Chief Secretary to Government.

Bombay, 21st February 1878. SIR, I have the honour to submit, for the information of His Excellency the Governor in Council, the Annual Report on the Lunatic Asylums of this Presidency and Sind for the year 1877. Number and comparative size of the asylums. 2.The asylums under the control of this department are five in number, viz., Colaba, Poona, Dharwar, Ahmedabad, and Hyderabad. The first is in charge of a Super- intendent specially appointed, and of the others the respective Civil Surgeons at the stations are the Superintendents. Colaba, the largest and most important of these institutions, had, during the past year, an average daily strength of 288.0 inmates; Hyderabad comes next with a strength of 115.0, then follow Ahmedabad with 108.1, Poona with 66.8, and Dharwar with 21.0. From these figures an idea of their comparative sizes may be gathered. The separate reports of the Superintendents, which are printed in full, give in detail all necessary information connected with the management of each asylum. I shall offer merely a few general remarks, and, as on former occasions, shall preface them with a short review of each series of statistical statements. Population. Admissions and re-admis- sions. Discharged. 3.Statements No. 1 furnish various particulars regarding admissions and discharges; it shows that the total asylum po- pulation was, for the past year, 869, as compared with 846 in the previous year. The total was composed of 717 males and 152 females. There remained, on the 1st January 1877, 469 males and 113 females, a total of 582 ; the new admissions during the year numbered 240 males and 34 females, and 8 males and 5 females were re-admitted.The total number of discharges from the asylums were 205 males and 35 females. Of these 81 males and 18 females were cured ; of 117 males and 16 females transferred to friends 82 of the former and 11 of the latter had undergone improvement to some extent, while 35 males and 5 females were thus transferred without having made any advance towards recovery. Many were, indeed, hopeless incurables. Of 8 insanes returned as discharged "otherwise," 6 males and 1 female were transferred to other B 6722 Mortality. asylums, and the eighth was an escape from Ahmedabad.The mortality has been greater. There were 56 deaths during 1877 as compared with 36 in the preceding year ; 44 of these were males and 12 females. On the 31st of December last, the total number remaining in the asylums was 573. Daily average strength and daily average sick. 4.The daily average strength shows a further increase ; it has risen from 584.7 in 1876 to 598.9 for the year under review. The average daily sick was 61.7, nearly the same as last year. Percentages of cures and deaths. 5.The percentages of cures and deaths to the daily average strength were3 Ages. 9.The ages of the 287 admissions are given in Statements No. 5. Between the ages of 20 and 40 there were 199 males and 32 females; from 40 to 60, 33 were males and 5 females; and above 60 there were 4 males and 1 female : under the age of 20 there were 12 males and 1 female. Types of insanity. 10.Statements No. 6 exhibit the various types of insanity.Of acute mania 105 cases remained, and 153 were admitted,4 preceding year. The largest proportion of admissions5 Net cost per head. duce, asylum manufactures, &c., Rs. 2,316-8-11; this is an increase on both tems of Rs. 611-3-8 and Rs. 127-8-9 respectively. The net cost per head in each asylum for the past two years, together with the average net cost and average daily strength, is thus shown :6 Condition as regards mar- riage and caste. 16.Statements No. 12 set forth the conditions of the asylum population as to marriage and caste. No. I of the accompany- ing tables gives the percentage which mortality and cures bear to the total treated for each sex and for each condition. In No. II are shown the conditions as regards marriage for the lunatics belonging to the principal Native communities :7 The nature of their crimes is as follows :8 Treatment. 23.As a mode of treatment, suitable employment still appears to be the one from which the greatest amount of benefit has been derived, the experience of each year showing more and more conclusively its value as an agent in the amelioration of the mental condition of the patients. I cannot speak too strongly of the evil influence exercised on treatment by the associating together of criminals and non-criminals, and would ask the earnest attention of Government to the remarks made by my predecessor on this matter in para. 25 of last year's report. The latter part of Dr. Murphy's 15th para.9 COLABA ASYLUM. Superintendent.10 Comparison between the present and previous year. 5.The number remaining on the 1st January 1877 shows an increase of 4, as compared with the number on the same date of the previous year, the admissions fell short by 15, the re-admissions are the same. Amongst these were a male and female who were discharged and re-admitted three times in the course of the year. There is a decrease of 11 in the total treated, though the daily average strength has slightly increased. The discharges show 45 recoveries against 53 last year, and the deaths amount to 19, 6 over the previous year. Daily average strength. 6. The daily average strength was 232.2 males and 55.8 females, total 2880. The percentage on the daily average were11 Length of residence of those who recovered and those who died. 11.The average period of detention of each lunatic who recovered was 10 months and 8 days, the maximum being 4 years and 9 months and 6 days, the minimum 1 month. Of those who died the average was 6 years 2 months and 10 days, the maximum being 27 years 3 months and 8 days, the minimum 6 days. Causes of insanity. 12.Statements No. 7 show the causes of insanity so far as could be ascertained. The proportion of known causes was 243 to 203 unknown. The known causes are divided, as usual, into the physical and moral, these agents are however so combined in the majority of instances that it is difficult to give to either their relative value as they seldom act singly. Amongst the poorer classes, and more parti- cularly among the males, one rarely sees a case of insanity of purely moral origin. The effect is frequently made to supply the place of the cause, and the early symptoms of insanity are often mistaken for that which has pro- duced them; thus insanity may assume the form of religious mania or melancholy, the origin of which may be intemperance or self-abuse. Again poverty, grief, and domestic troubles are generally associated with physical impairment. Amongst the physical causes 53 cases are attributed to ganja, 28 to spirits, and 3 to opium. Fever is said to have been the exciting cause in 10 cases, previous attack in 18, hereditary predisposition and congenital in 21, destitution 19, epilepsy 16, disorder of parturition 5, injury to head 12, climate 7, and masturbation 5. Of moral causes domestic troubles were those most frequently assigned and account for 24 cases. Religious excitement was assigned as a cause in 4 cases, study in 4, and fright in 3. Sickness and mortality. 13. Considering the depressed physical and mental state of the majo- rity of the patients, the general health has been comparatively satisfactory; the number of admissions into hospital, on account of disease, shows a decline of 153, as compared with last year ; the decline is chiefly in fever ; bronchitis and bowel complaints were also less prevalent; the mortality was chiefly confined to the aged and infirm. Of the 19 deaths, no fewer than 10 are recorded under the head of debility; 6 of these had been on an average over 16 years in the asylum. A European female, an old resident, died of phthisis ; 2 deaths resulted from epilepsy, one from traumatic erysipelas, and one patient sank from exhaustion consequent on maniacal excitment; dysentery and diarrh12 1 " not improved" was sent to England, and 1 died. The daily average strength was 47.8 males and 2.2 females ; of these 53.1 per cent of males and 89.68 of females were daily employed. Their crimes were murder, 30 males and 2 females ; voluntarily causing grievous hurt, 7 males, 5 mischief, 2 house-breaking, 1 piracy and assault; 10 males and 1 female theft, 1 culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and 1 rape. I wish to call particular attention to the fact that there are at present certain criminals who have quite recovered and are now perfectly sane and do not require any further treatment in an asylum These cases are a con- stant source of anxiety and responsibility. They are constantly plotting and endeavouring to escape, and, as they have to be treated as lunatics, they seldom or never can be got to work, thus setting a bad example not only in this res- pect, but also by inciting the lunatic patients to give trouble and not to work. General management. 16.The treatment of the inmates has been conducted on the same principles as described in previous reports. Re- straint has never been employed, and only in very rare instances has there been occasion to resort to seclusion, and then only for a short time. The attention of the lunatics was engaged as far as means would permit in some occupation, as nothing tends so much to subdue excitement and to diminish the necessity for seclusion as well ordered employment. The daily average number of insanes employed was 942 males and 20.2 females. The men were chiefly employed at cane-work, tailoring and gardening, and a few were engaged at the washing machine and in assisting the servants in the general domestic work of the insti- tution. Working account. 17.The following are the details of the work- ing account :13 POONA ASYLUM. Superintendent14 Remained on the 1st January 1877. 6. On this date there were 63 patients in the asylum, of whom 46 were males and 17 females. During the past year there have been 38 male admissions (of whom 1 was a re-admission) and 3 females, showing a total of 84 males and 20 females15 Ages of insanes. 14. The majority of ages of those admitted ranged between 20 and 40, numbering 27. Above 40 there were 7 and under 20, 6 patients. Causes of insanity. 15. In many instances no accurate history of the patient can be learnt. Of 26 males and 2 females admitted in 1877 the causes of insanity were unknown. Statement No. 7 shows the causes as far as could be ascertained. General health. 16. I may say that the general health of the patients has been remark- ably good. Two fatal cases of malignant cholera occurred in July last, within twenty days of each other, the cause being unassignable, nor did the disease show any tendency to spread. Details of treated. 17. Of these, 20 were discharged cured, viz., 17 males and 3 females. Five males showed an improvement and were made over to their friends, 7 had to be classed under headings different to those under which they were admitted, viz., 6 males and 1 female. Six patients died, 5 males and 1 female. There remained on 31st December 51 males and 15 females, a total of 66. The total treated shows an increase of 15 over that of the previous year. Length of residence and age of those who recovered and died. 18. The average residence of those who recovered during the year was 6 months, the maximum being 1 year 6 months, the minimum 1 month ; their average ages were 34 years. The average residence of those who died was 51/2 years, the maximum being 20 years, the minimum 10 days; their average ages being 40 years. Employment. 19. The average number of lunatics employed during the year was 53, viz., 38 males and 15 females, being a slight in- crease in number above that of last year. The men have been employed in gardening, the women in grinding corn. Cost of each patient. 20. The cost of each patient amounted to Rs. 141-4-8, or less by Rs. 3-14-2 than in 1876. Owing to the prevailing scar- city last year, the diets show a slight increase, while all other items show a decrease. Table 9 gives a statement of this. Receipts and expenditure. 21. The cash receipts during the year amounted to Rs. 9,931-13-1, of which Rs. 9,411-4-1 were drawn from the Trea- sury, Rs. 520-9-0 showing the amount realized by the sale of garden produce, corn grinding, and receipts from a paying patient. Of the above sum Rs. 492-6-0 were paid into the Treasury as the amount realiz- ed from labour, &c. The balance of Rs. 28-3-0 was expended for garden and contingencies. The balance of Rs. 8,918-14-1 was the net expenditure for the year, or Rs. 63-13-9 in excess of the net expenditure of last year; this excess being due, in a great measure, to the enhanced price of food dur- ing 1877. Not having yet been informed of the actual amount to be charged for water supplied for the last four months under the new system introduced by the Irrigation Department, this item, which would have shown an excess of net expenditure, must be included in the report for the current year when the sanction of Government has been obtained for payment of the same Visitors. 22. The visitors regularly inspected the asylum every month, and their remarks were invariably favourable ; there were no escapes or irregularities during the year, and the conduct of the establishment has been good.
16 DHARWAR ASYLUM. Superintendent.17 Paying patients; 9. The number of paying patients has been 2 only. Profit of garden. 10. In addition to supplying the asylum with vegetables, the sum of Rs. 42-3-0 has been realized by the sale of fruit and vegetables, the produce of the garden. Rs. 25-5-6 have been saved by economy in working the garden, making a total of Rs. 67-8-6, which has been paid into the Government Treasury. Attendance of committee. 11. The members of the monthly committee have visited the asylum regularly during the year, and have performed their duties satisfactorily. AHMEDABAD ASYLUM. Superintendent.18 Daily sick. 7. The average daily sick was 3.8 males and 2.3 females against 1.1 males and 0.8 female during 1876. The increase of average is owing to cases of old age and debility remaining from last year, being constantly under treatment for the whole year and 1 case of debility under treatment for 9 months. Percentages. 8. The percentages on daily average strength were19 Types of insanity. 15. Twenty-seven cases of acute mania remained at the end of the year, chronic mania 53, melancholia 2, acute dementia 2, chronic dementia 11, idiocy 7, and imbecility 6; among the admissions 8 were cases of acute mania, 3 chronic mania, 2 acute dementia, and 1 imbecility, the total number treated being 122. Of 35 cases of acute mania 3 males and 1 female recovered, 1 male improved, and 1 male and 1 female died. Of chronic mania 56 cases were treated, 1 female recovered and 1 male and 1 female died; of melancholia 2 cases were under treatment ; of acute dementia 4 cases, of which 1 female died; chronic dementia gives 11 cases, of which 1 female died ; idiocy 7 cases, of which 1 male and 2 females died ; imbecility 7 cases, total 122, of which 5 recovered, 1 improved, and 9 died. Causes of insanity. 16. Among the above total there were 66 cases, in which the cause of insanity was known and in 56 unknown ; of the former 34 cases are attributed to the abuse of ganja, and to intoxication, debauchery, &c., 4 from the results of fever, 8 from epilepsy ; 9 were hereditary and congenital. From moral causes 11 cases are shown resulting from religious exaltation, ill-treatment, and loss of money. Length of residence among all patients of those cured and died. 17. Among the patients discharged cured, the average period of resi- dence was 1 year 7 months and 22 days, the maximum being 2 years 7 months and 2 days, and the minimum 6 months and 13 days. Among those who died the average residence was 1 year 8 months and 25 days, maximum 4 years 5 months and 18 days, minimum 1 month and 26 days. Sick in Hospital. 18. The total number under treatment in hospital during the year was 49 from all causes detailed in the accompanying form, of which 36 were discharged, 9 died, and 4 remained under treatment. The greater number of cases were of inter- mittent fever; 1 case of scurvy occurred, which was admitted into the asylum, suffering from that complaint. Percentage of sickness and mortality. 19. The average daily number of sick was 6.1 and percentage of deaths to treated was 25.7, against 11.8 of 1876. Cash accounts. 20. The amount received from the Government Treasury was Rs. 13,261-7-1. The receipts from paying patients was Rs. 922-1-11. The sum realized by sale of garden produce and lunatics labour was Rs. 637-1-0. The total receipts being Rs. 14,820-10-0. Expenditure incurred. 21. There is an increase in the cost of establishment of Rs. 234-1-10, owing to the increase in the price of food all over the country and the consequent necessity of giv- ing grain compensation to the employs. In the diet of patients there is also an increase, mainly from the same cause, of Rs. 1,167-7-2. In bazar medicines an increase of Rs. 64-13-2, also on account of the high prices. Contingencies show an increase of Rs. 125-1-5 from the same cause and sundry petty repairs executed in the asylum during the year. Decreased. 22. Clothing shows a decrease of Rs. 72-8-5 over the past year.
20 Average gross and net cost. 23. The gross cost of each patient for maintenance, clothing, &c., &c., was Rs. 122-10-9 per annum. The net cost of Rs. 108-4-0, being an increase of Rs. 10-8-11, result- ing from the causes above-mentioned. Receipts and expenditure on account of garden. 24. The gross receipts of the sale of garden produce and the amount realized by patients labour was Rs. 905-14-0. The net receipts Rs. 637-1-0, being Rs. 63-1-9 in excess of those of the preceding year. Population to average number employed. 25. The mean population was 108.1. The average number employed was 82, showing a slight increase over the number employed in 1876. Credits or annual income. 26. The amount realized during the year from sale of garden produce, patients labour employed on grinding provision, &c, was Rs. 905-14-0. The amount unrealized from crops grown, such as jowri, grass, &c., &c., as forage for the cattle, gar- den improvements, mending fences, levelling, road-making, &c., &.c, Rs. 797-2-2. The total amount would, therefore, represent a sum amounting to Rs. 1,703-0-2, being a slight increase on last year's amount. Debits or annual expen- diture. 27. The total amount expended during the year was Rs. 1,065-15-2, this includes Rs. 797-2-2 on account of plant, machinery in store, &c., &c., and Rs. 268-13-0 for raw materials and all other charges. The net profit on all for the present year amounts to Rs. 637-1-0, this is also an increase of Rs. 63-1-9 over the previous year, showing satisfactory financial results. Condition as to marriage and caste. 28. Out of the total remaining under treatment on the 31st December 1876, 37 were single, 41 married, 12 widowed, and 18 unknown; 5 single were admitted during the year, 6 married, 1 widowed and 2 unknown ; of these 10 were males and 4 females; 32 single Hindus and 10 Mahomedans ; 38 married Hindus, 7 Mahomedans and 2 Parsis; widowed 9 Hindus and 4 Mahome- dans ; unknown 15 Hindus and 5 Mahomedans. Garden. 29. There is an excellent garden, in extent about 13 acres, surrounding and forming the asylums grounds ; about 7 acres of this is cultivated as a garden for English vegetables during the season and native vegetables during the rains. The vegetables produced are of excellent quality and command a ready market in the bazar. The rest of the ground is taken up with fruit-trees and part not as yet brought under the influence of irrigation is cultivated during the rains for the purpose of growing jowri, &c, &c., as fodder for the bullocks working the wells, the produce of which goes a long way towards feeding the cattle for about 9 months of the year. Vaccination. 30. There have been no admissions requiring vaccination during the year. Restraint. 31. No restraint was required during the past year. Clothing. 32. The clothing, as usual, is supplied by the jail factory and is durable and suited to the wants of the patients.
21 Food. 33. The food is of good wholesome quality. It is supplied by con- tract and the diet scale is that laid down in the asylum rules. Fresh vegetables are supplied from the garden in abundance and the diet seems well suited to the wants of the inmates who are well nourished and in good condition. Official visitors. 34. The official visitors have regularly visited the establishment monthly and half-yearly, and at the last meeting on the 22nd December 1877 recommended the discharge of one Heera Poonja, a criminal lunatic, who has now been quite sane for 21/2 years. Escapes. 35. There were 2 escapes during the year, 1 of whom was captured and brought back to the asylum by the police. One has not been recovered, and, as he was much improved and nearly ready for discharge, it is probable he may not be apprehended. The former case was not returned as escaped in the register, as he was re- covered in a few days. Establishment. 36. The establishment was efficient. Mr. Joseph Solomon, resident Assistant, continues to discharge his many and onerous duties with the same zeal and ability he has always shown, his tact and good temper in dealing with the lunatics render his services to the last degree valuable in an establishment of this descrip- tion. I have had to discharge one warder for carelessness in allowing a patient to escape while under his charge. General remarks. 37. Owing to the high price of all articles of food, &c., &c., during the past year, the expenses of this establishment have necessarily increased. The profits of the garden produce and labour have, however, increased to a small extent. The cost per head of each patient shows an increase of Rs. 11-7-7; this is entirely owing to the increase of the price of food, and the consequent cost of grain compensation to the establishment. A large amount of work has been done by the patients in a most creditable manner, and the garden and grounds much improved in consequence. The number of deaths this year is 9, against 4 in the previous one: 3 were cases of organic disease, viz., 2 Bright's disease, 1 phthisis pulmonalis, and 2 cases of epilepsy. Cases scarcely under the control of treatment represent the increase : the other cases were much debilitated, two of them in a hopeless state of idiocy. Not- withstanding, the general health of the asylum has been and continues very good. SIR COWASJI JEHANGIER LUNATIC ASYLUM, HYDERABAD. Superintendent.22 untried prisoner, and it was suspected that he was malingering, he was a desperate character; the Magistrate was informed that the prisoner would probably attempt to escape, which a few days later he effected. Garden. 2. The garden has been cultivated throughout the year and has been rather more productive. Out-door occupation in the garden is most beneficial, and we try to get every patient to work in it. Buildings. 3. The aslyum buildings remain unaltered ; the Public Works Depart- ment have carried out the annual repairs ; the wall round the asylum grounds is being continued entire- ly by asylum labour. Water-supply. 4. The water-supply has been good throughout the year ; the drainage is good ; the rain-fall has been only 3 inches 40 cents. Clothing. 5. The clothing has been good and sufficient ; it was necessary to procure a few more blankets this year than last ; they were all obtained from the jail-factory. Food. 6. Food has been good and sufficient, but owing to the defective inundation, to the scanty rain-fall and great expor- tation of grain to the famine districts and of wheat to England, provisions have been dear ; the contractor was losing a large sum monthly, when the Commissioner in Sind, on application being made to him, released the contractor of his engagement and allowed him to supply food at the rates published monthly by Government. Accommodation. 7. The accommodation has been more than sufficient; no alterations are necessary. Conservancy. 8. The conservancy is good and effective. Admissions and dis- charges. 9. During the year there were 61 new admissions, 6 females and 55 males ; of the latter 6 were criminals. Of these 35 were Mahomedans, 24 were Hindus, and 2 were Christians ; 42 have been discharged23 Restraint. 15. Restraint has been rarely needed, a few cases have at times been very violent, necessitating great care and watchful- ness, one in particular, a very strong sepoy formerly in the 1st Belooch Regiment; fetters or straight jackets have not been needed. Treatment. 16. Treatment has been much as in previous years ; but subcutaneous injection of Liq. Hydr. Perchlor has been more often resorted to with, I believe, good effect even in cases where there is no suspicion of venereal disease; friction with oil all down the spine is also found beneficial. Employment. 17. We endeavour to get all to do some work ; if we are able to accom- plish this our prognosis is much more favourable. There is garden work, making bricks, making the wall round the asylum, pumping water, &c., and for amusement there are native musical instruments, and lately Sir Cowasji has kindly given a musical box. There are also pet animals, as rabbits, two hog-deer, and some Persian cats. Total cost. 18. The total cost of the asylum has been Rs. 12,220-4-8, and the cost per patient Rs. 103-7-7, somewhat more than during the previous year, chiefly owing to the enhanced cost of provisions, Rs. 30 were paid into the treasury on account of paying patients and Rs. 290-15-6 from sale of garden produce; this is rather more than what was realized during the previous year. Establishment. 19. The daily average has been 115, and the establishment all told number 28, the same as last year ; they have all worked well. Mr. Mendes, the Hospital Assistant, has given me the greatest satisfaction ; he is kind to the patients, and sees that the warders are so also, and he encourages work. Visitors. 20. The regular visitors' meeting is once a month ; generally on the 1st Thursday, in order that friends wishing to take out a lunatic may know when to attend : all the warrants of those admitted since last meeting are examined, as well as the warrants of those who may have died, or who are proposed to be discharged. Buildings and asylum generally are inspected in April and October. The Session Judge attended, and all the criminal lunatics were examined, and a report on each made and forwarded to the Local Government. The visitors attended regularly. [Statements.

Christians numbered 108, of whom 93 were Europeans53 ing with the question of the water supply to the garden at the Poona Asylum. The statistics relative to the larger percentage of cures amongst married as compared with unmarried lunatics given in statement No. 12 bear out the facts observable in the report of 1876 about the two classes. 8. Lunatic labour was made use of at Colaba to rectify im- perfections in the drainage. The water supply generally was good except at the above-named asylum, but it is expected that the new Tulsi main when opened will effect a great improvement in this im- portant matter. There was unavoidably some overcrowding at the Colaba Asylum, and this evil must necessarily continue to some extent until a new asylum is built at Ratngiri. Funds will not admit of this work being undertaken at present. 9. In conclusion, His Excellency the Governor in Council is glad to observe that all the asylums have been regularly inspected by the official visitors and the Deputy Surgeons General, while commendation is due to the Superintendents and the establishments of the various asylums for the care and watchfulness which they have shown in carrying on their difficult and responsible duties.
