Introductory.2 would expect in such circumstances. Mr. Smith the Deputy Commissioner of Betul, where village vaccination actually increased, rightly remarks &quot; I am surprised that there has been such an increase in primary vaccinations in a year when for a thing to be recommended by Government has been enough to raise up prophets to cry it down.&quot; 5. Vaccinations performed by the special staff.3 ment by Local Bodies of their own Health Officers which would remove many other difficulties and relieve the Civil Surgeons of a thankless task. 7. It is hardly surprising to hear that in some districts the people have opposed vaccination. In Jubbulpore it is stated that in 91 villages the parents of 1,177 children refused to have their children vaccinated. This is perhaps due to the preachings of non-cooperators In the district of Raipur one of- these men has been convicted for opposing a vaccinator in his duties. I hope other districts will follow the example set by the Raipur district authorities. The time is not far distant when District bodies might consider the importance of extending compulsory vaccination to villages, A new Act would be required if this is done. 8. The average amount of work done per man varies greatly4 the Vaccine Institute were taken into account, the cost per successful case stands at Re. 0-6-8 against Re 0-6-1 in the previous year. 12. For some years Government has been placing at the disposal of Commissioners allotments for distribution to District Funds for general purposes. In Nerbudda and Chhattisgarh Divisions considerable sums from this money have been allotted for medical and vaccination purposes which have not been shown in the financial statement of the annual Vaccination report. These grants some of the local bodies have been utilising purely on vaccination, e. g., Nimar, to which the Commissioner has allotted Rs. 4,000 and Govern- ment allowed a further sum of Rs. 891 to meet the arrears of pay in consequence of the introduction of time-scale of pay from 1st January 1921. Of this amount, i. e., Rs. 4,891, the Council spent Rs. 4,195-7-3 and have a balance of Rs. 695-8-9 The Council, however, say that they spent some of their own funds also on vaccination, but the accounts do not show that they spent anything. Similarly, in Betul the allotment made by the Commissioner was Rs. 4,521 and the District Council obtained from Government an additional Rs. 133-4-7 as leave allowances of the vaccination staff making a total of Rs. 4,654-4-7. Of this sum, the total amount spent on vaccination was Rs. 4,543-3-5 which leaves a balance of Rs. 111-1-2 from provincial funds in the hands of the District Council. In my opinion such indiscriminate grants from provincial funds should be stopped. 13 Preparation and supply of lymph.5 The average purchase price per calf was Rs. 14 and on an average Rs. 9 was realised per calf on sale in the local bazaars. The total expenditure incurred was Rs. 24,336-15-1 of which Rs. 9,504-7-5 were spent on salaries and travelling allowance and the rest in contingencies. Rs. 11,280-9-0 were realised during the year as follows :6 the returns appended to this report. The Civil Surgeons will be instructed to exhibit their inspections also in the returns in future. 15.

No. 2387/567-IX GOVERNMENT OF THE CENTRAL PROVINCES, MEDICAL ADMINISTRATION AND PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. Nagpur, the 6th October 1923. READ2 Another reason for the unsatisfactory state of vaccination during the triennium was the stoppage of executive action by Revenue officers. In the past the practice was for Tahsil- dars to take action against parents who failed to have their children vaccinated, but for obvious reasons the system could not be continued as a permanent measure. It is necessary however in the interests of the coming generation that the executive action of the Revenue officer should be replaced by some other method of pressing the merits of vaccination on the attention of the people. During the triennium under review, the administrative and executive control over the vaccination staff was transferred to the local bodies, and His Excellency the Governor acting with the Minister trusts that they will take an active interest in the work. The District Councils at present have no health officers of their own and Civil Surgeons have accordingly been instructed to advise in technical matters and assist in supervising the staff. Many of the local bodies have delegated to the Civil Surgeons their powers of technical control over the staff, and the Local Government trusts that, under the new conditions, a real effort will be made to recover the ground lost during recent years. For, as the Director remarks, if a considerable percentage of children remain unvaccinated, the susceptibility of the population to small- pox infection greatly increases and a severe epidemic may sweep over the province at any time.

Introductory.2 6. Total operations performed.3 Chanda, (25,059), Drug (24,077), Saugor (23,777), Buldana (19,485), Chhindwara (18,130), Jubbulpore (16,354), Balaghat (15,267) and Amraoti (15,148). In most of the districts the decrease is ascribed to the non-co-operation movement, low birth- rate or other cause as noted below. The largest fall was in Bilaspur where the work received a great setback in the years 1920-21 and 21.22. Owing to the unusual delay in the introduction of the time-scale of pay, the staff became discontented and went on strike, consequently the work suffered in the beginning of 1922-23 also but subsequently it made fair progress. In Seoni the fall is attributed to several changes amongst vaccinators and non-pay- ment to them of the allowance for carrying their equipment; in Bhandara to the exodus of the people to other places owing to scarcity, changes amongst vaccinators, high mortality among infants and the prevalence of plague in Gondia circle in 1921-22 ; in Raipur to the exodus of people to tea gardens and the Tata Iron Works owing to scarcity, and also to slackness of vaccinators; in Chanda to deficiency coupled with slackness of the vaccination staff; in Drug to the prevalence of influenza and malaria, slackness of the vaccination staff and scarcity prevailing in the district; in Buldana to inefficiency of vaccination staff and prevalence of plague; in Chhindwara and Jubbulpore to the prevalence of plague; in Saugor, Balaghat and Amraoti to the non-co-operation movement as stated above. 9. There can be no doubt that the non-co-operation move- ment has affected vaccination to some extent, but the inefficiency coupled with the slackness of vaccinators,as reported by several Civil Surgeons, was also responsible for the decrease of work. Now that the pay and prospects of the staff have improved, if it is overhauled and stimulated, there is no doubt that a considerable improvement in work can be shown. It is therefore essential to put vaccination once more on a satisfactory footing, but apart from the improvement that is necessary in the staff it is as remarked by the Deputy Commissioner, Bhandara, absolutely necessary that the general public and especially schoolmasters and Local Board members should display a far greater degree of interest than they evince at present. This, it is hoped, will result from the health publicity campaign. 10. An important feature of the triennium was the revision of pay of the vaccination staff and the transfer of the administrative and executive control of these men to local bodies Government sanctioned a time-scale of pay for these men and it was given effect to from the 1st January 1921, but as most of the District Councils and Boards expressed their financial inability to comply
4 with these orders, Goverement gave them grants aggregating Rs. 25,846 to cover the extra cost involved upto the end of the financial year 1921-22, and for subsequent years they were requested to meet the extra cost from their own funds. It seems that the revised scale has been introduced in all the districts except Balaghat and Bhandara. In Balaghat district the staff was first given the increased rate of pay according to the scale from January 1921 to February 1922 and after- wards they were put back on the old rates, a peculiar procedure adopted by the District Council and one which has created discontent among the men. This will not be conducive to good results. In this connection Mr. C. A. Clarke, C.B.E., I.C.S., the Commissioner, remarks &quot; The District Council have apparently not seen their way to treat the vaccinators generously and I am afraid it will require a bad epidemic of small-pox in this district to make the local authorities duly sensible of the dangers of the present situation&quot;. Similarly, the Bhandara District Council have introduced a special rate of pay but as this rate is not the same as that sanctioned by Government, the staff is dissatisfied. The Deputy Commissioner, Bhandara, writes &quot; I consider that we cannot expect a complete return to the good figures of 17-18 unless the staff is adequately treated in the matter of pay and the useless members are weeded out&quot;. It would be well for these Councils to reconsider the matter and treat the staff adequately. 11. Under the orders issued by Government in November 1922, the administrative and executive control of the vaccination staff has been transferred to local bodies, but as these bodies have no Health Officer of their own to advise them in technical matters regarding vaccination, they have made arrangements with the Civil Surgeon of their districts to carry on the technical control and supervision of the staff. The relations of the local bodies with the Civil Surgeons under the new régime have been cordial, and in Nimar increased powers have been given to the Civil Surgeon. In Berar the Commissioner remarks that there still remains to be determined the exact relation of Civil Surgeons to local bodies as Superintendents of Vaccination and the matter of entrusting definite powers by the local bodies to Civil Surgeons is under consideration. 12. During the triennium reports of opposition to vaccina- tion were received by Civil Surgeons from many villages and sent to the tahsildars for necessary action. This is an irregular procedure. Such reports should go to the Deputy Commissioner and local body. It is stated that parents flatly refused to get their children vaccinated as they have adopted a more independent attitude towards vaccination and in spite of the persuasion used by
5 inspecting officers and others their attitude remains unchanged, so it is difficult for the staff to work in rural areas. The Civil Surgeon, Wardha, reports opposition in 58 villages and 84 villages in Jubbulpore refused vaccination. Unless therefore vaccination is made compulsory in villages the work will become more difficult in future years. In my notes on vaccination for the year 1921-22 I had already suggested the desirability of extending compulsory vaccination to villages. This view is supported by the Commissioner, Chhattisgarh division, who writes &quot; I think the days of executive action are past. While the bulk of the people realise the benefits of vaccination, the staff has to cope with general apathy on the one hand and with passive resistance on the part of a minority. Executive action by low paid subordinates, with its inevitable vagaries, tends to aggravate rather than minimise these difficulties and to make the department unpopular while I have no doubt that the people would prefer the more dignified form or compulsion under the law. Very few prosecutions under the Act, if extended to rural areas, would be necessary and they may be limited to those sanctioned by the District Magistrate&quot;. 13. It is disappointing to find that except in Yeotmal district, the average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator during the year 1922-23 has been very low in every district. In Chanda, Saugor and Drug the average is a little more than half the minimum standard laid down (viz., 2,000), while in Seoni and Mandla it is less than half. It is therefore of extreme importance that local bodies should pay attention to this matter and arrange to set it right. There is no reason why one vaccinator in Yeotmal can do 3,505 vaccinations while another in Seoni does only 600. 14. Revaccinations.6 16. Total cost of the department. Statement II.7 &quot; The cost per dose of vaccine manufactured was six pies only. The results of primary vaccination were 99 per cent case success and 94 per cent insertion success and for revaccination 72 case success and 49 per cent insertion success&quot;. 18. The cost of preparation of lymph has increased from 5½ pies in the preceding year to 6 pies per dose. Heretofore the local bodies and others to whom lymph was supplied were charged at the rate of three pies per dose, but from the 1st August 1922 the cost of lymph has been raised to six pies. 19. Inspection of vaccination. Statement V.8 attributed to the non-co-operation movement and the attendent difficulties with which these men were faced but in the year 1922-23 the work shows some improvement although it was very low in the districts of Jubbulpore, Saugor, Seoni and Chhindwara. 22. The Sub-Assistant Surgeons in charge of outlying dispensaries and those in charge of epidemic dispensaries inspected schools regularly and reported the names of children found unvaccinated. Necessary action was taken to get these vaccinated by the vaccinators of the circles. 23. Percentage of success in primary and revaccina- tion.[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]

9 Akola is well known. This as well as the Murtizapur Muni- cipal Committee, is so indifferent that they do not give any help to their vaccinators. The Deputy Commissioner, Akola, writes &quot; If the Murtizapur Municipality continue to be slack in helping vaccination, it will be fair for Government to withhold a part of their grant to the dispensary. The same applies to the Akola Municipality for their failure to prosecute guardians of unprotected children&quot;. It is evident therefore that apathy and indifference of the Municipal authorities are the main causes for this state of affairs. I hope energetic action will be taken to have the balance of unprotected children vaccinated as early as possible, otherwise a severe epidemic of smallpox will result. Proper vaccination stations are required in every town and children should be collected at them. 25. Mortality from small-pox,10 and steps are required to make good this defect especially as local bodies have now delegated powers of executive and technical control to them and will expect a reasonable standard of supervision. In towns Sanitary Inspectors are notified as additional superintendents, but this branch of their work is almost neglected by them. Committees who pay for this work to be done should see that their money is not wasted. The question of making vaccination compulsory in rural areas is being urged and will be examined. Now that Civil Surgeons are, at the request of the local bodies themselves, acting as executive officers and technical advisers in vaccination all complaints of refusal and obstruction should be made known to the local body concerned as well as to the Deputy Commissioner. Reports should not be made direct to the tahsildar. Annual reports should moreover henceforth be sent to this office through local bodies as well as through district officials so that they may be informed of every thing that is taking place The Civil Surgeon, Akola, feels the need for a district sani- tary officer and proposes that a sub-assistant surgeon should take the place of the assistant superintendent of vaccination in this capacity. The above report in my opinion emphasises the need for separate district health officers to look after vaccination registration, school inspection, epidemic outbreaks, health pro- paganda, etc I am quite sure that the work requires such an officer and that the local bodies would rise to a consciousness of the needs and responsibilities of public health if they had their own whole-time expert to help and advise them. The reports of Lieut.-Col. Fowler and Major Warwick, I.M.S., are most useful while Captain Perdriau has also written an excellent report. The delay in submitting this report is due to the late receipt of the district reportsAPPENDIX.

Introductory.2 against the vaccinators and vigorous supervision exercised during the year. Similarly, the Drug Report shows decided improvement in its figure. In Chhindwara district the standard of work is satisfactory, as in spite of the prevalence of plague in Sausar tahsil during the vaccination season there was an increase of 2,250 vaccinations, and the Commissioner remarks that the Civil Sur- geon is to be congratulated on the good results achieved. 6. Vaccination by the special staff.3 The increase was under the head contingencies. The cost of each successful case was annas 6 and pies 11 against annas 6 and pies 10 during the year 1923-24. Excluding the expenditure incurred in connection with the Vaccine Institute, Nagpur, the cost per successful case stands at annas 6 against annas 5 and pies 11 in the preceding year. 10. Supply of lymph4 course in vaccination only. The sanitary inspectors sought private training. All the above passed an examination held by the Director of Public Health, after the course. The assistant superintendent conducted the training classes.&quot; 12. Inspection of vaccination.5 tact and supervision displayed by the assistant superintendents of vaccination. In Damoh the assistant superintendent toured for 13 days only and consequently the outturn of inspection work was very low, i.e., 5.35 for primary and 0.12 for re-vaccination. This is attributed to the post of the assistant superintendent of vaccina- tion being allowed to remain vacant from December to April. Similarly in Seoni the assistant superintendent of vaccination's inspection is much below the standard and the Civil Surgeon ascribes this to the fact that the decision of the District Council regarding the reversion of Wazir Husain and the appointment of 1st grade vaccinator Nasibdad Khan as assistant superintendent, was pending for some months. 15.

Similarly, the Akola municipality showed marked indifference to vaccination and consequently it suffered from small-pox. 19. General.APPENDIX.

Agents for the sale of Publications issued by the Central Provinces Government. [NOTE.No. 3138-524-IX. GOVERNMENT OF THE CENTRAL PROVINCES. MEDICAL ADMINISTRATION AND PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. Nagpur, the 7th September 1926. READ2 cent of the population will not come for vaccination and the only way this dangerous portion of the populace can be dealt with is by compulsion. The high water-mark of voluntary vaccination has been reached, though we are by no means neces- sarily near the high water-mark of small-pox.&quot; The Deputy Commissioner, Amraoti, adds that though in municipal areas where the Act applies, the vaccination statistics do not give pro- mise of greatly improved results accruing from its application in rural areas, he considers that compulsion must come even if it is to be limited at first as proposed by the District Council, Amraoti, to villages with over 5,000 population, and further that it is not the overcoming of active opposition to compul- sion which he fears but the apathy and indifference of a large section of the population to the Act. The local Government endorses these remarks which find repetition to a greater or less extent in most of the district reports. 2. The number of revaccinations performed was 154,000 as against 147,000 for the previous triennium. The Civil Surgeon, Yeotmal, in commenting on the large increase in the deaths from small-pox in that district notes that several casualties occurred among vaccinated persons. As immunity from small-pox only lasts for some seven years, revaccination after a certain period is essential and the figures clearly show that this matter is not receiving the attention it deserves. 3. The period under review was the first complete triennium during which the administrative and executive control of the vaccination staff has been exercised by local bodies. Many local bodies have taken an active interest in vaccination work and certain noteworthy innovations have been introduced at their instance, but some have failed to appreciate fully the responsibilities which devolved on them with the transfer of control. An increase in the staff is over- due in some districts, and more active work and more supervi- sion in the field should be insisted on from Assistant Superin- tendents. The local Government has noted with interest that the scheme for training schoolmasters in vaccination, which was sanctioned by it in the previous year at the instance of the Buldana District Council, is reported to have worked extremely successfully in that district and elsewhere where it has been introduced. If further experience confirms the conclusions reached this year, there is obviously a wide scope for the development of this agency for carrying out both vaccination and revaccination.

As remarked by some Civil Surgeons, the close and effective supervision exercised by the supervising staff, the drastic action taken against the vaccinators and the keen interest displayed by the Deputy Commissioners and their assistants in vaccination work and the cordial relations exist- ing between the District Councils and Civil Surgeons contri- buted a good deal to the improvement of work during the triennium under review. In Nagpur city it is reported that some extra vaccinators were temporarily engaged for pushing on with vaccination and re-vaccination work during the year 1925-26 owing to the prevalence of small-pox. 8. In spite of increase in the number of vaccinations, there are still large number of children remaining unvaccinated and this is mainly due to the slackness of the vaccination staff. The returns show that in several districts vaccinators did not perform even the minimum number of operations prescribed, viz., 2,000. It is of extreme importance that steps should be taken in order to ensure that these men give a sufficient outturn of work. The infliction of adequate punishment on vaccinators for faulty work and recruitment of suitable men in place of slack and unreliable persons must be resorted to by Civil Surgeons and District Councils in such cases. 9. The Civil Surgeon, Nimar, remarks that the work has suffered owing to shortage of staff, discontent among vacci- nators owing to the appointment of an outside person to the post of assistant superintendent of vaccination and forfeiture of claims of senior men in the department. 10. Cases of opposition to vaccination in rural areas are not less frequent and the introduction of compulsory vaccina- tion is therefore advocated from time to time. The Civil Surgeon, Damoh, reports that he tried his best to explain to the people the benefits of vaccination at his visits to the villages, held meetings of the leading and influential villagers and gave lectures on vaccination and small-pox, but the people still refuse to have their children vaccinated, chiefly the high castes. The Civil Surgeon, Raipur, quotes a particularly
4 marked instance of the kind. He states that Rai Bahadur D. N. Choudhri, O.B.E., reported that a few cases of small- pox had occurred in a village belonging to him and on his requisition the services of a vaccinator were placed at his disposal so that he could arrange to get all the unprotected children in the village vaccinated. But he was unable to persuade the villagers and the vaccinator had to return without succeeding in carrying out a single vaccination. It is reported by some Civil Surgeons that for want of such a legislation vaccination work in rural areas is getting very difficult and the vaccinators are even refused food, and sometimes abused. At times they have also met with violence, and their equipment has been damaged as already reported in previous year's report ; the Civil Surgeon, Bilaspur, reports that in Padampur circle the local vaccinator was assulted in Jogni village while in the discharge of duties. 11. In order to avert such a state of affairs and to adequately carry on vaccination work in rural areas there is a genuine need for the early introduction of compulsory vaccination. In this connection it is pleasing to read Mr. G. A. Khan's (Commissioner, Nerbudda Division) remarks reproduced below with which I concur :5 been provided with any allowance or a cooly for the transport of their kit. It seems unfair that the District Councils should refuse the allowance to their vaccinators on plea of funds when this has been allowed in most of the other districts. It is essential to authorize this allowance to the staff to enable them to carry on the work efficiently and it is hoped that these bodies will now see their way to sanction it at an early date. 13. Re-vaccinations.6 chiefly due to the payment made to the vaccination staff at the increased rate according to the time scale of pay and also rewards to vaccinators and payment of coolie allowance. The cost of each successful case was Re. 0-6-10 in 1923-24, Rs. 0-6-11 in 1924-25 and Rs. 0-6-7 in1925-26. Excluding the expenditure incurred in connection with the Vaccine Institute, Nagpur, the cost per successful case stands at Re. 0-5-8 in 1925-26 against Re. 0-6-0 in 1924-25 and Re. 0-5-11 in 1923-24. 16. Supply of lymph.7 amounted to Rs. 22,751-3-6 made up as follows: Sale of lymph Rs. 19,752-11-6; sale of calves Rs. 2,245-4-0; sale of Rabbits Rs. 8; sale of tonga bulls Rs. 60; sale of lancets Rs. 318-8-6 and miscellaneous Rs. 366-11-6. The value of lymph in storage on 1st April 1926 was Rs. 10,989. &quot; There were two sessions as usual, April to September and October to March, and the Assistant Superintendent Mr. Maruty Ramkrishna conducted the Training Classes under the supervision of the Superintendent. Ten masters, 16 vaccinators, three sanitary inspectors and one assistant superintendent of vaccination went through the Training course successfully.&quot; 18. Inspection of vaccination-Statement V.8 19. The assistant superintendents of vaccination and others such as the Assistants to Civil Surgeons, epidemic dispensary assistant medical officers and sanitary inspectors in municipal towns inspected 56.11 per cent of the primary and 29.90 of the re-vaccinations in 1925-26 and 55.29 and 23.45 in 1924-25 and 49.43 and 21.09 in 1923-24 as compared with 52.18 and 20.54 in 1922-23, 50.37 and 17.65 in 1921-22 and 49.77 and 24.88 in 1920-21. In some of the districts the amount of touring done by the assistant superintendents of vaccination during the year 1925-26 was insufficient, as it was below the prescribed standard of 135 days in the vaccination season. As remarked in the notes for the year 1924-25 the outturn of vaccination work depends mostly on the amount of energy, tact and supervision displayed by the assistant superintendents of vaccination and it is therefore very necessary that these men should spend at least 135 days in every season on inspection tours. The Civil Surgeons should see that the orders laying down the above standard are rigidly enforced and that those giving less outturn except for sufficient reasons are suitably dealt with in future. The Civil Surgeon, Betul, remarks that the assistant superin- tendent of vaccination still stays at headquarters too long where really he has very little to do. It seems that these men spend much of the time at headquarters which should not be permitted. 20. The assistant medical officers in charge of local dispensaries and those in charge of epidemic dispensaries inspected schools regularly and reported the names of children found unvaccinated; necessary action was taken to get these children vaccinated by the vaccinator. 21.

NOTES ON VACCINATION IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AND BERAR DURING THE YEAR 1926-27. Introductory.2 5. Vaccinations performed by the special staff. State- ment I.3 doing periodical inspection of schools and the Civil Surgeons have been asked to give effect to it. 9. Cost of department. Statement II.4 associations and mission hospitals were supplied with lymph on indents. The total supply of lymph to the whole province was 684,720 doses, detailed below: 5 4.30 per cent of the revaccinations against 7.64 and 4.36, res- pectively, in 1925-26. Some of the Civil Surgeons have devot- ed more time to this important part of their duties. Balaghat 121 days, Drug 69 days, Chanda 44 days, Mandla 43 days, Betul 43 days, Bhandara 41 days, Hoshangabad 40 days and Chhindwara 40 days. In several districts it is noticed that the-prescribed period of vaccination tour, viz., six weeks, was not maintained. The Civil Surgeons will see that the rules allotting six weeks for vaccination touring will not be overlook- ed in future. 13. The Assistant Superintendents and others, such as the Assistants to Civil Surgeons, epidemic dispensary Assistant Medical Officers and sanitary inspectors in municipal towns, inspected 58.50 per cent of the primary and 27.62 of the re- vaccinations in 1926-27 as against 56.11 and 29.90 in the pre- ceding year. The prescribed period of touring for Assistant Superintendent of Vaccination is 135 days in the vaccination season, but in some districts it is noticed that this standard has not been attained. In Damoh district the Assistant Super- intendent of Vaccination toured for 66 days only. Such a small amount of touring is quite inadequate for effectively checking the vaccinators' work. It is very necessary that these men should tour for 135 days at least in every season, and the Civil Surgeons should see that these orders are rigidly enforced. 14. Percentage of success in primary and revaccinations.6 brought the irregularities to the notice of the local bodies con- cerned. Besides this, I inspected 460 primary vaccinations in five municipal towns and 21 villages. 17. Deaths from small-pox.7 abuse and annoyance. The Civil Surgeon, Bhandara, reports that Sihora village is noted for refusing vaccination for some years and that small-pox has broken out there this year with disastrous results. The need for the introduction of compul- sory vaccination in rural areas is very keenly felt and the proposal is under the consideration of Government. 22. The proposal to amend section 9 of the Vaccination Act, making vaccination for children compulsory after the beginning of the 3rd month of age, has been submitted and is under the consideration of Government. 23. It is customary to make four insertions for primary vaccination, and it is very interesting to note how children, with only two successful insertions, tend to develop small-pox within 2STATISTICAL STATEMENTS.

Introductory.2 5. Vaccinations performed by the special staff. Statement I.3 standard and the Civil Surgeons and District Councils will, it is hoped, pay attention to this matter. The infliction of adequate punishment on vaccinators for faulty work and recruitment of suitable men in place of slack and unreliable persons should be resorted to in such cases. 7. Re-vaccinations have decreased from 82,603 in the previous year to 64,850 in 1927-28. It would be well for the local bodies to take energetic action so that re-vaccination may be pushed on as vigorously as possible to avoid severe epide- mics of small-pox. The rule in the Public Health Manual (paragraph 8 (b), chapter VI) regarding age-limit for re-vacci- nation has been amended so as to allow of re-vaccination being performed over the age of seven. 8. Dispensary vaccination and vaccination by other agencies. Statement III.4 moffusil not taking proper care of it and the rapid deteriora- tion of it when exposed to heat and delay in transit; the chloroforming of lymph was therefore stopped. II. The report for the year 1927-28 as submitted by the Superintendent of the Vaccine Institute, Dr. Edibam , M.B.B.S., Dr. P. H, (Amer.) is reproduced below:5 &quot; This slight lowering of percentages in case success and insertion success was due to indifferent results from about 30 brews which were sent out chloroformed. As the vaccinators in the moffusil could not use this lymph within the prescribed three days after receipt and as chloroformed lymph deteriorates rapidly the chloroforming process was stopped and the results improved. &quot; The total expenditure during the year was Rs. 19,241-8-9 against Rs. 25,051-3-3 of last year. Of this Rs. 10,477-7-0 was spent on salaries and travelling allowances and the rest Rs. 8,764-1-9 on contingencies. This reduction in expenditure was due partly to the new method of operations introduced since January 1927 and partly to the lower salary of the Superintendent. &quot;The total receipts amounted to Rs. 23,936-11-9 as detailed below:6 could not as usual do much touring for inspection purposes owing to work at headquarters. In Hoshangabad the less touring is attributed to the transfers of Civil Surgeons. In several districts it is noticed that the prescribed period of vaccination tour, viz., six weeks was not maintained and it is hoped that Civil Surgeons will see that the rules allotting six weeks for vaccination touring will not be overlooked in future. 13. The Assistant Superintendents and others such as the Assistants to Civil Surgeons, epidemic dispensary Assistant Medical Officers and Sanitary Inspectors in municipal towns inspected 56.46 per cent of the primary and 24.88 of the re-vaccinations as against 58.50 and 27.62 in the preceding year. In some districts the amount of touring done by the Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination is not satisfactory and must be considerably increased; as for instance in Hoshangabad the Assistant Superintendent of Vaccination was on tour for 93 days and it is stated that the man being of very advanced age is unable to tour properly ; in Nimar the Assistant Superintendent of Vaccination toured for 88 days; in Damoh 121 days ; in Yeotmal one of the Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination was on tour for 128 days. As a rule every Assistant Superintendent of Vaccination ought to spend at least 135 days in every vaccination season on inspection tours and the Civil Surgeons should see that these orders are rigidly enforced. 14. Percentage of success in primary and re- vaccination.7 notified areas were 53,153 and deaths among children under one year of age were 11,344. Thus 41,809 children were available for vaccination and of this 30,000 or 72 per cent were successfully vaccinated which is less than the percentage vaccinated in 1926-27, viz., 88. In several towns there is a large balance of unprotected children which is dangerous and the need for taking prompt action to get the balance cleared off is urgently called for. I hope the municipal committees will take energetic action to clear off the balance of unprotected children as early as possible. 16. During the year my predecessor examined the vaccination records of all municipal towns and notified areas he visited and brought the irregularities to the notice of the local bodies concerned. Besides this, he inspected 1,100 primary and 87 re-vaccinations in six municipal towns and 53 villages. 17. Deaths from small-pox 8 1927 for all municipal towns in Nerbudda Division and in August 1927 for municipal towns in Narsinghpur district. The Civil Surgeon, Narsinghpur, states that so far as Nar- singhpur Municipality is concerned the application of these Regulations had no influence on the spread or otherwise of small-pox for which the fault lies in the fact that the municipal committee has no reporting agency worth the name. In this connection the Deputy Commssioner, Narsinghpur, remarks that these Regulations have been rarely enforced and that there are no sufficient data to judge whether they were efficacious in preventing the out-break or spread of the disease. In Nimar and Chhindwara districts the application of these Regulations was not found necessary. 22. Under the scheme sanctioned by Government for the training of Schoolmasters in Berar in vaccination, some Schoolmasters have been trained. Thirteen trained teachers were employed for vaccination work in Amraoti district, 6 in Akola, 9 in Buldana and 4 in Yeotmal. The figures of vaccination work performed by these men are included in State- ment No I. With regard to the work of these School teachers the Civil Surgeon, Amraoti, remarks &quot;I am not per- sonally much impressed with any great advantage that their employment entails. They certainly have not the experience of ordinary vaccinators and their results as entered by them are much more at fault than in the case of vaccinators.&quot; It is proposed to extend this experiment to the Central Provinces districts and the opinions of the District Councils have been called for in the matter. 23. The Civil Surgeon, Wardha, says that the appoint- ment of Assistant Superintendent of Vaccination should be provincialized while the Civil Surgeon, Raipur, suggests that an Assistant Medical Officer be appointed as a District Vaccination Officer to supervise the work of Assistant Superintendents and the Vaccinators.

Agents for the sale of publications issued by the Central Provinces Government. [NOTE.No. 9626-689-IX. GOVERNMENT OF THE CENTRAL PROVINCES. MEDICAL ADMINISTRATION AND PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. Nagpur, the 5th December 1929. READ2 children successfully vaccinated fell from 88 per cent in 1926-27 to 68 per cent in 1928-29 and to learn that the decrease was mainly caused by the apathy of the local bodies and their lack of supervision over their vaccinat- ing agency. For instance, in Jubbulpore, only 19 per cent of the vaccinations performed in the town have been inspected by the Health Officer's staff. 2. Cases of opposition to vaccination in rural areas are becoming more frequent, and the report states that it is now more generally realized that Government has no powers of compulsion. The question of extending compulsory vaccination in selected rural areas is now engaging the attention of the Local Government, but before any measure of compulsion can be fully effective, it must be supported by a healthy public opinion. The Director of Public Health attributes the unsatisfactory state of affairs in rural areas to the slackness of the vaccination staff. The Local Government, however, considers that the root of the difficulty lies not so much with the agency employed as with the local bodies themselves. Until a measure of compulsion can be introduced, the progress of vaccination must depend upon the interest evinced and the supervision exercised by the local bodies, and unless local bodies generally bestir themselves to awaken a proper public feeling among the less educated sections of the people in regard to this important matter, progress is bound to be slow. In this respect the example of the District Council, Seoni, where it is reported that 90 per cent of the school-going children are now protected, is commended to the notice of other district councils as an object lesson of what can be achieved by keenness and co-operation. Apathy in the public is possibly to be expected, but apathy in the local bodies cannot be excused. The local Government trusts that all local authorities will realize their responsibilities in this matter and will endeavour not only to keep their staff up to the mark but also to take active steps to educate public opinion generally as to the value of the protection offered and the dangers of failure to adopt it. In this connection Government also wishes to emphasize the necessity for adequate touring by Civil Surgeons and others responsible for the inspection of vaccination work.
3 3. The scheme for the training of schoolmasters in Berar sanctioned previously has continued during the triennium. The results have been somewhat diverse in the various districts, and there is an increasing measure of doubt as to whether it is wise to entrust to this agency work that is so entirely foreign to their ordinary duties. The Yeotmal District Council has determined to send no more teachers for training, and the Akola District Council considers that the scheme is a dangerous one, but on the other hand good results have again been achieved in Buldana. Further trial of the experiment will be made, but at the same time Government commends to the notice of district councils the remarks of the Director of Public Health suggesting the alternative employment of schoolmasters as advisers and instructors of the people in their local areas. The work of the vaccinators will be both easier and more rapid if the path is made smooth for them in advance, and the work of preparation and propaganda is perhaps more likely to be suited to this agency than that of the actual performance of the operations.

TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AND BERAR FOR THE YEARS 1926-27, 1927-28 AND 1928-29. 1. Introductory.2 considers that two such appointments are absolutely essen- tial. In Chanda district one post of the Assistant Super- intendent of Vaccination remained vacant for about 10 months during the year 1928-29. It is undesirable that these posts should be allowed to remain vacant for such long periods to the detriment of vaccination inspection. 5. At the end of the previous triennium there were in all 306 vaccinators. This number was increased by eleven in the districts of Nagpur, Bhandara, Wardha, Chanda, Betul, Chhindwara, Akola and Yeotmal. The increase was largely due to some Municipal Committees entertaining independent vaccinators in their towns. The District Council, Raipur, sanctioned the post of vaccina- tion clerk from June 1926. The Civil Surgeon, Yeotmal, thinks that the pay of the vaccinators be increased so as to attract right type of men. The Civil Surgeon, Akola, suggests that the District Council should make provision for two reserve vaccinators. It is hoped the District Councils would pay attention to the recommendation made by the Civil Surgeons. 6. Total operations performed.3 7. During the triennium ending 1919-20 as many as 1,616,431 operations were performed, but during the next triennium ending 1922-23 there was a considerable decrease, the number being only 1,279,167. This was ascribed to a large extent to the non-co-operation movement. There has been a steady increase from the year 1922-23 onwards, and it is satisfactory to note that the vaccination work for the triennium under report shows an increase of 129,714 operations over the triennial period ending 1919-20 and approximates to the standard obtained in the triennium ending 1916-17. 8. Vaccination performed by the special staff. State- ment I.4 vaccinator complaining that people were unwilling to submit to vaccination. The balance thus left is a danger, and it is hoped that the Civil Surgeons will take necessary measures to clear off this arrears. 11. The minimum number of vaccinations prescrib- ed for each vaccinator is 2,000, but the returns show that the standard was attained in very few districts. In Hoshangabad district the average number of vaccinations performed by a vaccinator during the year ending 1928-29 was only 1,280. The average of Narsinghpur, Jubbul- pore, Damoh, Betul and Wardha is also disappointing, the number being 1,341, 1,529, 1,575, 1,600 and 1,607 respec- tively. The Civil Surgeons and the Local Bodies, parti- cularly of the above districts, should therefore pay attention to this matter and see that the vaccinator gives a sufficient outturn of work. The infliction of adequate punishment on vaccinators for bad work and recruitment of suitable men in place of slack and unreliable persons should be resorted to in such cases and it is of the extreme importance that the District Councils should give due weight to the recommendations of the Civil Surgeons in this matter. I quote an instance of the apathy shown by the Jubbulpore District Council. The Civil Surgeon recommended the dismissal of a vaccinator whose work was hopelessly bad, but the District Council failed to take any adequate disciplinary action against the man. In this connection the Commissioner, Jubbulpore Division, remarks: 5 words of advice. In this connection the Civil Surgeon, Jubbulpore, remarks: 6 in charge Cantonment Hospital, Pachmarhi, performed 358 vaccinations, while 27 vaccinations were done by the medical subordinate in Pachmarhi Civil Dispensary. The railway staff in Nagpur, Chanda, Saugor and Raipur were responsible for 597 vaccinations, the Tea District Labour Association, Raipur, for 1,590, the Mining agency, Chhindwara, for 2,548 and the Dhamtari Mission Dis- pensary for 22. 17. During the year 1927-28, the Government sanc- tioned the proposal for the vaccination of school children by the Medical Officers doing periodical inspection of schools and the Civil Surgeons were asked to give effect to it. 18. Cost of the department. Statement II.7 Institute Dr. C. R. Edibam, M.B., B.S., (Bom.), Dr. P.H. (America), is reproduced below: 8 &quot;The result of working of lymph:9 of the work of vaccinators has already been urged in pre- vious reports, and it is hoped that Civil Surgeons will see that the rules allotting six weeks for vaccination touring will not be overlooked in future. 22. The Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination and other inspecting officers such as the Assistant to Civil Surgeons, Assistant Medical Officers in charge epidemic dispensary and Health Officers and Sanitary Inspectors in municipal towns inspected 52.40 per cent of the primary and 21.22 of the revaccinations during the year 1928-29, 56.46 and 24.88 in 1927-28 and 58.50 and 27.62 in 1926-27. This shows that the inspection work during the year 1928-29 was not satisfactory. The figures for the previous trien- nium are 56.11 and 29.90 in 1925-26, 55.29 and 23.45 in 1924-25 and 49.43 and 21.09 in 1923-24. In some of the districts the Assistant Superintendent of Vaccination has not toured for the prescribed period of 135 days in the vaccination season. It has been pointed out in previous reports that the outturn of vaccination work depends to a large extent on the amount of energy, tact and supervision displayed by the Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination, and it is therefore very necessary that these men should be out on tour for at least 135 days in the vaccination season. The Civil Surgeons, it is hoped, will see to this and deal with those who do not show satisfactory results. 23. The Assistant Medical Officers in charge of local dispensaries and those in charge of epidemic dispensaries inspected the schools regularly and reported the names of children found unprotected; necessary action was taken to get these children vaccinated by the vaccinator. 24. Percentage of success in primary and revaccina- tion.10 category as an unvaccinated child, I have recently issued instructions to consider vaccination successful if a child has two good marks. 25. In revaccinations the percentage of success claimed by vaccinators was 51.74 in 1928-29 against 50.12 in 1927-28 and 54.28 in 1926-27, while the Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination and Civil Surgeons found on inspections 39.25 and 39.86 in 1928-29 as compared with 42.14 and 44.57 in 1927-28 and 43.12 and 35.51 in 1926-27. 26. Vaccination in municipal towns.11 number 205, followed by Chanda 117, Drug 138, Mandla 116 and Narsinghpur 105. Very few deaths were returned from Amraoti (10), Damoh (6), Betul (4), Wardha (1) and Bhandara (1). As stated in previous reports, the increase in small-pox is due to the fact that every year a number of children escape vaccination. It is, therefore, extremely important that vaccination of children should be as complete as possible every year. 29. Temporary Small-pox Prevention Regulations.12 masters are being trained in vaccination, their work may also be given a fair trial for a period of two years. 31. The proposal to amend section 9 of the Vaccina- tion Act, making vaccination for children compulsory after the beginning of the third month, has already been submitted for the consideration of Government. 32. The delay in the submission of the report is due to the late receipt in this office of the district reports through the Deputy Commissioners and Commissioners and also on account of the increase of work, consequent on the transfer of the control of medical arrangements for scarcity camps to this department.
