Price AS. 12 or 1s. 2d. No. 31. The development of the Leish man-Donovan parasite in cimex rotundatusTHE PRODUCTION OF ALKALI IN LIQUID MEDIA BY THE BACILLUS PESTIS. THE fact that plague microbes cease to grow abundantly in liquid media after a month or six weeks has hitherto been ascribed to the supposed consumption of all the available nutriment. Thus, Mr. Haffkine*, in his evidence before the Indian Plague Commission in 1898, says the broth becomes modified in the course of five or six weeks, so that "the liquid is exhausted, its nutritious elements having been incorporated in the body of the bacilli" ........."It will not feed any further growth." Dr. E. Klein2 Six flasks containing 1000 c.c. of broth, which had been sown with plague four months previously, were tested for plague growth and reaction with the following result: Growth on agar. No. of c.c. of normal acid per litre required to produce neutralisation. I. Sterile 14.7 II. " 22.2 III. " 25.2 IV. " 24.5 V. " 23.5 VI. " 24.1 That is to say, in four months' growth the plague germ had produced alkalinity in the broth equivalent to from 1½ to 2½ per cent. of normal alkali as tested by the following procedure: Ten c.c. of the neutral broth used in the laboratory, which was amphoteric to blue and red litmus papers, was diluted with 90 c.c. of distilled water in a porcelain dish. To this was added 2 c.c. of solution of litmus made according to the directions in the British Pharmacop3 When again tested on the 11th July the following were the results4 The 0.25 alkaline broth showed abundant dots and a few stalactites. The 0.50 show similar growth but in, a less degree, and the growth is distinctly less in the broths of higher alkalinities. The 0.75 The 1.00 The flasks of 1.5 and 2 per cent. acid broth show no growth at all. 27th June 1904.5 prophylactic flasks that have stood in the incubation room for eighteen months, and have a reaction approaching 2 per cent. of normal alkali, germs, can still be recovered sufficiently alive to show growth on agar slopes. A question naturally arising from the above is: can the plague bacillus evolve alkali when grown in acid broth so as to produce a neutral and finally an alkaline broth? To solve this the following proceeding was adopted. The first set of the above series of flasks was shaken up on 9th July 1904. When examined on 11 July 1904, it was found that the best stalactites were to be seen in the flask containing broth originally acidulated to the extent of 0.75 per cent. On testing the fluid in this flask it was, found that it now contained the equivalent of 0.15 per cent. of normal alkali, therefore the plague bacilli had made enough alkali in the eighteen days they had been growing to neutralise all the acid introduced, and had produced in addition 0.15 per cent. of normal alkali and this would no doubt have gone on until the 2 per cent. limit of alkalinity was reached. Similarly, the plague germs growing in the flask containing the 0.5 per cent. acid broth were found to have produced 1.05 per cent. and the germs growing in the 0.25 per cent. broth, 0.6 per cent. of alkali. Two flasks containing a similar quantity of amphoteric broth and sown with the same germ had in the same eighteen days produced the equivalent of 0.40 and 0.35 per cent. of alkali respectively. In the series of alkaline broth flasks the following results were obtained. Flask with 0.75 per cent. of normal alkali added, showed a deficiency in alkali to the extent of 0.01 per cent. Flask with 1.0 per cent. of normal alkali added, showed a deficiency in alkali to the extent of 0.35 per cent. Flask with 1.5 per cent. of normal alkali added, showed a deficiency in alkali to the extent of 0.75 per cent. Flask with 2 per cent, of normal alkali added, showed a defi- ciency in alkali to the extent of 0.91 per cent. These two latter flasks though showing no stalactites but only a muddiness after the eighteen days' incubation, yet gave a good growth of plague when a few drops were placed on agar, proving that the germs were still alive though their growth had been inhibited. A second observation in confirmation of the above may be recorded. The series of flasks noted above as sown on 8th July 1904 were tested on 29th July 1904. The growth was undoubtedly best developed in the flask containing 1 per cent. acid broth. There was little growth in the 1.25 per cent. acid broth and none apparently in the higher numbers of the acid series. A precipitate was, however, evident in these highly acidulated broths as well as in others of the same degree of acidulation which had not been sown with plague. Cultures taken from this whole series showed a pure growth of plague in all
6 the alkaline broths, and in the less acid ones up to 1.0 per cent.; the 1.25 and 2.0 per cent. acid broths showed no growth at all on agar. The results got by titration of this series, as well as those of the first experiment, are shown below in percentages. Denomination of flask. Result of titration. Alkali produced. Alkali produced in first experiment. 2 per cent. acid 2.0 per cent. acid. 0 1.50 " " " 1.38 " " " 0.12 1.25 " " " 1.26 " " " 0 1.00 " " " 0.26 " " " 0.74 0.75 " " " 0.48 " " alkali. 1.23 0.90 0.50 " " " 0.67 " " " 1.17 1.05 Amphoteric 0.49 " " " 0.49 0.42 0.35 0.75 per cent. alkali 1.04 " " " 0.29 7 The conclusion; then, appears to be that8 chloric acid of the British Pharmacop9 Time.

Unsown broth and a four-month-old broth plague culture were tested with itmus and phenolphthalein, with the result set out in the following table: Substance tested. Reaction to litmus . Reaction to phenolphthalein. Unsown broth 0.79 per cent. normal alkali 2.41 per cent. normal acid. Four-month-old broth plague cultur 2.68 per cent. normal alkali 0.69 per cent. normal acid. Alkali produced 1.89 per cent. normal alkali 1.72 per cent. normal alkali. It would appear, then, that the plague germ produces alkali in the broth as at present used, just as it did in the broth as formerly prepared and to very much the same extent. To test once more the theory that it is the presence of alkali that causes cessation of growth of the plague germ the following experiment was carried out. Twelve flasks of anti-plague vaccine in process of incubation were selected from the stock at that time in the laboratory. The germs with which these flasks had been sown were of different strains from the following sources. Germs 2 and 3 were from the heart blood of a rat, 4 and 5 from the heart blood of a guinea-pig, and 6 from the heart blood of a monkey. C
10 The reaction of these flasks was tested on 11th July 1907 with the follow- ing results: Flask No. Ger m sown. Date of sowing. Period of incubation.

The flasks were tested from week to week, and it was found that the amount of alkali again gradually increased as in the former experiment. The final result after thirty-seven days is given below.

But it was discovered that the quantity of acid added was not quite sufficient actually to produce this result, so that the amount of alkali obtained as stated opposite each flask in the above table is slightly more than the germ really formed (cf. para. 2, p. 6, supra.) The idea that a broth treated as above, i.e., neutralised after the formation of alkali so as to allow the plague germ to have a fresh term of active growth, would be more efficient as a prophylactic, was suggested. A trial of a vaccine made from such twice grown broth was made in 1904, but no advantage was apparent as regards prophylactic property when contrasted with the ordinary prophylactic made at the same time. What is this alkali ? Is it a metabolic product of the plague germ, and if so, has it anything to do with the toxin ? That the twice grown broth was no more efficacious than the ordinary vaccine might be due to the acid added having destroyed its immunising property12 8. A highly acid broth is inimical to the growth of the plague germ, and it. soon dies out in such a medium. 9. The alkaline body is probably not the plague toxin. In conclusion, I desire to acknowledge the unstinting and generous help afforded in the first part of this research by my friend and colleague, Captain W. Glen Liston, M.D., I.M.S., and in the latter by my friend, Mr. A. R. Normand, B.Sc., Professor of Chemistry in the Wilson College, Bombay, without whose expert chemical knowledge the work would have been well nigh impossible. G. I. C. P. O. No. 18 S.
