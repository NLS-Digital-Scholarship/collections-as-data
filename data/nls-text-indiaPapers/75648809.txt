(vii) VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. 54. Table III.10 Investigation Officer (Poultry), Sind. There were thus 3 Veterinary Inspectors and 27 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons working at the end of the year. 26 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons held charge of veterinary dispensaries and one was on reserve duty at Karachi Veterinary Assistant Surgeons throughout Sind worked very hard to meet the very heavy demand of public for vaccination of their cattle against Rinderpest and it is satisfying to note that the demand was met with satisfactorily. 60. The post of Veterinary Inspector, Lower Sind Circle, Karachi, was held by Mr. J. R. Banna throughout the year, except for. one month and 18 days from 8th October 1945 to 7th November 1945 and from 28th February 1946 to 17th March 1946 when he was on leave. The post of Veterinary Inspector, Upper Sind Circle, was held by Mr. A. I. Ukely throughout the year, except for a period of three months and 2 days when he was on leave on average pay from 5th September to 6th October 1945 and from 8th November to 7th December 1945 and again from 7th January to 6th February 1946, when Mr. K. U. Ramchandani, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was promoted to officiate for the above period. Mr. A. I. Ukely held charge of the two circles in addition to his own duties when Mr. J. R. Banna was on leave during the year under report. 61. Mr. J. R. Banna was on tour for 149 days, travelled 515 miles by road and 5,372 miles by rail and visited 92 villages. Mr. A. I. Ukely was on tour for 133 days, travelled 712 miles by road and 3,083 miles by rail and visited 45 towns and villages during the year under report. Both the Veterinary Inspectors periodically inspected the Veterinary Dispensaries, supervised and checked the field work of Subordinate staff in the villages and performed very useful work within their sphere of duties during the year under report. 62. There were 13 Veterinary Field Compounders working in the department during the year under report. Of these, one is on deputation to the Sind Police Rifles, 8 were incharge of the Itinerating Veterinary Dispensaries and 3 posts were vacant and the remainder under training at the Veterinary Dispensaries. 63. The clerical staff notwithstanding the shortage of hands discharged their duties in a. most conscientious manner. V.II GENERAL REMARKS. 66. There was no landing of horses from overseas at the Port of Karachi during the year under report. 67. During the year under report post of Assistant Veterinary Investiga- tion Officer (Poultry), Sind, has been entertained by the Government on 50 : 50 basis alike the scheme for Disease Investigation Officer. It is hoped much of the work on poultry diseases which requires to be done, without which no progress in poultry development can take place in the Province, will be undertaken by Assistant Veterinary Investigation Officer (Poultry) this will consist of systematic survey and application of scientific method in the control of diseases. 68. The scales of pay recently revised but held in abeyance might bring a radical change in students taking up Veterinary as a profession which will mean more Veterinary Assistant Surgeons for the department. Post-War Development schemes have been administratively approved and with their implementation a brilliant future for cattle health and wealth is in sight with the adequate staff being available on revised scales of pay which are kept in abeyance for the time being, to work them. 69. Recent experience of controlling the spread of rinderpest in Sind has fully shown that the present 37 Veterinary Dispensaries in Sind are far from enough to meet the demand of live-stock owners to control the spread of contagious diseases efficiently. 70. Sind Cattle Disease Act (XXII of 1940) has been made use of in certain places where the maldars were reluctant to offer their animals for preventive inoculations, by the application of this Act, the lives of hundreds of animals have been saved and disease brought under control.
