Class A.( 2 ) stood third in the examination, subsequently ceased to attend. Of the remaining 16, ten were holders of stipends from District Boards and other sources, so that only six Government stipends of Rs. 5 each were awarded. 9. Class B.( 3 ) The students had ample opportunity of studying most of the contagious diseases, as there were 33 cases of glanders, 107 of rinderpest, 6 of influenza, 5 of rabies, 3 of strangles, 11 of eczema contagiosa, and one each of malignant catarrh and variola equina (Appendices VIII, IX, X and XI). During the year 5 horses belonging to the Calcutta Police, and 70 head of cattle and 9 ponies belonging to the Calcutta Municipality, were admitted into the hospital. All the municipal cattle were suffering from rinderpest. They were conveyed to the hospital in the ambulances immediately on receipt of intimation from the Gowkhanas. The municipal ponies were all cases of suspected glanders; three of these were found free from the disease, five were found glandered and destroyed, and one died while under observation. The number of operations performed was 400, against 364 in 1898-99 (Appendix XII). The number of first class patients was 115 (99 in-patients and 16 out- patients) against 98 (88 in-patients and 10 out-patients) in 1898-99, and the fees received under this head were Rs. 3,104-5, against Rs. 2,526-12 in the previous year. The number of second class patients was 113, yielding fees to the amount of Rs. 2,199-3, against 115 patients, yielding fees to the amount of Rs. 2,256-10 in the previous year. The success of the scale of fees, which came into force on the 4th June 1898, was maintained. The revised Act for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which is before Government, will enable the College to be registered as an infirmary under the Act. It has also been contemplated to move the Entally Glanders Hospital to Belgachia, but I do not know how much progress has been made in the matter. THE AMBULANCES. 16. The ambulances have been of great service and have saved much suffering. They were frequently requisitioned during the year. THE FORGE. 17. Three -hundred and fifty-one horses were shod in 1899-1900 against 393 and 307 in 1898-99 and 1897-98, respectively. The falling off in the number appears to be due to the number of horses sent from Dum-Dum being- less, owing to the change of regiments this year. FINANCIAL. 18. The fees for the treatment and shoeing of animals realised during the year amount to Rs. 6,355-15-3 against Rs. 5,878-4-9 in the preceding year They would have amounted to Rs. 6,407-5-3, had the fees for the treatment of Government animals been included. The cost of feeding the patients is Rs. 4,502-10-6, against Rs. 5,553-11-0 in 1898-99. Thus there has boon a sur- plus of Rs. 1,853-4-9, in 1899-1900, of fees over the cost of feed of the patients, against Rs. 324-9-9 in 1898-99. This larger surplus is partly due to the admission of a larger number of first class patients, and partly to the curtail- ment of feeding charges by the use of fodder grown on the area newly rented by Government. As this land will probably be required for other pur poses than cultivation, it is doubtful if the surplus will be so large next year. Defaulters.( 4 ) The hours for the meals have also been changed. They are now between 10 and 11 in the morning and 8 and 9 in the evening. The tiffin is given between 4 and 5 P. M. The Medical Officer attended regularly throughout the year. The general health of the boarders was satisfactory. The staff of the hostel has been increased by the appointment of an addi- tional cook. It now consists of one manager, four ward servants, four cooks, two sweepers and one durwan. A few articles of furniture have been purchased during the year to pro- vide accommodation for the increased number of students. An attempt was made to reduce the number of mosquitoes by pouring kero- sine on the neighbouring tanks. While the experiment lasted, it was found that the mosquitoes were certainly less troublesome. The students were also invited to use mosquito curtains. I am inclined to think that something may be done in this direction to reduce malarial fever. CONFERENCE. 20. I was deputed to attend a conference of the heads of colleges which met at Umballa on the 29th January 1900, " to settle the most suitable curriculum which would tend to uniformity of teaching at the various veterinary educa- tional establishments in India." Though I do not consider that the result of our labours will be to place the vernacular schools upon exactly the same footing as the English teaching ones, I am quite sure that the conference was needed, and that a very great deal of good will ensue. LECTURES TO AGRICULTURAL STUDENTS OF SIBPUR COLLEGE. 21. At the request of the Director of Land Records and Agriculture, Bengal, it has been arranged that a course of 48 lectures on Veterinary Hygiene, Cattle Breeding and Rearing shall be delivered by Mr. E. H. Brand, the senior lecturer, during next vacation. INSTRUCTION TO DRIVERS OF THE ARMY COMMISSARIAT TRANSPORT CORPS. 22. The Commissary-General-in-Chief has written to the Bengal Govern- ment to know if 30 transport drivers can be instructed at vacation time in nursing sick animals. A report on this subject has been submitted.
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BENGAL, For the year 1899-1900. VETERINARY ASSISTANTS. 23. I append a complete list of all the passed men of the Bengal Veterinary College arranged according to seniority and showing their employment during the year 1899-1800 (Appendix XIV). The demand for the services of Veterinary Assistants is greater than the supply, which constitutes a gratifying and practical proof of the value of their work. In many instances, I was compelled to call upon the senior students and the professors to do temporary work in the districts. APPOINTMENT OF VETERINAEY ASSISTANTS. 24. Bankim Behari Chandra( 6 ) Public opinion about him was favourable. The villagers are reported to have appreciated his instructions, generally speaking, though in some cases they did not carry them out, despite the fact that the Collector brought all possible inducement to bear on them to do so. The number of animals treated by him- was 382, of which 196 were cured and 186 died. He visited 18 villages (Appendix XV). He was also employed by the Subdivisional Officer of Jamtara from 16th to 31st March 1900, in visiting localities where rinderpest was raging in an epidemic form, in treating cattle affected and in advising the people as to the best means of preventing the occurrence and spread of the disease. He visited 15 villages and treated 122 animals, of which 30 were cured, 43 relieved and 49 died (Appendix XV). The subdivisional officer remarks that the majority of cures that took place was due to nature. In one or two cases, the Veterinary Assistant assisted the cure. He also mentions that the period of the Veterinary Assistants' employment was too short for much work to be done, and at the same time funds were not available for the purpose of purchasing necessary medicines. The people were commencing to put faith in the Assistant, and the subdivisional officer hopes to apply for the services of another Veterinary Assistant sooner or later. William Dunne( 7 ) He was subsequently temporarily employed by the District Board of Darbhanga. The Chairman reports that the Veterinary Assistant reported himself to him on the 25th November 1899 and left the district on the 5th January 1900. Out of his stay of 44 days, the actual number he worked was only 17, i.e., from 6th to 22nd December, while the remaining 27 days he spent at head-quarters or at Pandaul under various frivolous pretexts of illness, &c. He was supposed to go round the villages in which cattle disease was prevailing, to diagnose and treat it and to advise the villagers as to the measures to be taken by them. The manner in which he discharged his duties was very unsatisfactory. He was considered lazy and inefficient by Mr. Needhm, who as a member of the District Board, resident at Pandaul, had several opportunities for seeing his work. From Appendix (XV) it will be seen that the Veterinary Assistant treated 391 cattle and visited 54 villages. These figures were taken from the very imperfect diaries of the Veterinary Assistant. This man has been a failure, and will not be employed in future. Ranjit Singh( 8 ) cases are of slight epidemic outbreaks, to treat which the Veterinary Assistant was sent out. It is also reported that sanction has recently been accorded by the District Board to engage a nalbund, and that this project will pay for itself. I have inspected this Dispensary, and regret that it is not as successful as it used to be. This may be partly due to the new system, and things may improve. It may, however, be remarked that the Subdivisional Officer can do a great deal in these matters. It may also be necessary to change the Veter- inary Assistant in charge, if things do not improve. 26. Gaya.( 9 ) The number of in and out-patients treated at the hospital was 99, and 398 respectively (Appendix XVI). The Veterinary Assistant visited 12 villages, and found only two cases of rinderpest, the disease having already subsided (Appendix XV). The total receipts during the year were Rs. 1,098-1-9, against an expenditure of Rs. 925-13-3, showing a balance of Rs. 172-4-6 (Appendix XVII). 29. Tippera.( 10 ) The fees realised and credited to the District Board fund during the year under report was Rs. 89-4, and there was an expenditure of Rs. 1,130-6-1, of which the details are given in Appendix XVII. I would remark that the amount of fees credited is hardly in reasonable- proportion to the number of animals treated, even if due allowance be made for free patients and for the fact that half the fees go to the Veterinary Assistant. In my opinion the dispensary can be made to pay its way if properly super- vised and could maintain two Veterinary Assistants. 33. Dumka.( 11 ) by the Veterinary Assistant as to their fitness for work, and those which were found unfit were not allowed to work until thoroughly cured. Hackney carriage horses and ponies were treated. Eighty-one operations were performed. There were also nine post-mortem examinations held at the dispensary, but for want of proper staff, such as compounder and sweeper, whose services are required on such occasions, great inconvenience was felt. Examinations for cruelty to animals have to be made by the Veterinary Assistant, but the dispensary does not receive any aid from Government on this account. During the absence of the Veterinary Assistant on tour, the dispensary remains closed, and animals which are brought during that time go away without treatment. Number of patients last year. Number admitted during the year under report. From October 1898 to March 1899. 142 328 The Chairman gives the marginally noted figures which show that the number of patients has increased by 22 per cent. during the year as com- pared with that of the preceding year, and says that the people are gradu- ally appreciating the usefulness of the dispensary. The Veterinary Assistant visited 95 villages in the mufassal and treated 1,053 patients, of which 460 were cured, 356 relieved, and 237 died (Appendix XV). The epidemics in many places were not allowed to spread, as the villagers were instructed to adopt preventive measures and to use common country medicines. The cost of the dispensary is met partly from the District Board funds and partly from subscriptions. The total receipts during the year were Rs. 737, against Rs. 819 in preceding year, and the total expenditure was Rs. 741 (the excess of Rs. 4 being paid by the District Board), against Rs. 825 in the preceding year (Appendix XVII). The Chairman observes with regret that the monthly subscriptions have come down from Rs. 64 in March 1899 to Rs. 24 in March 1900. He also remarks that the Veterinary Assistant lacks energy, and the subscribers are said to complain that their animals are not regularly treated and inspected. The complaint may possibly be due to the absence of the Veterinary Assistant in the district; but he has been told that he is not giving all the satis- faction he should, and that his retention of the appointment depends upon his doing his duty properly. I have inspected the dispensary. I do not think a compounder is neces- sary, and no doubt a sweeper can be hired when necessary. I am glad the number of patients is increasing, and hope in time an itinerating Veterinary Assistant will be engaged. 35. Burdwan.( 12 ) 36. Kanti.( 13 ) 42. In North Bihar.( 14 ) In February foot-and-mouth disease was reported by Veterinary Lieutenant E. E. Martin amongst the Commissariat bullocks at Dum-Dum. At his request, I inspected 172 head of slaughter cattle and 89 transport bullocks, and found four bullocks suffering. The conductor in charge was treating them properly under Veterinary Lieutenant Martin's direction. 46. In the Mufassal.( 15 ) 50. Other research work has been carried out at the Bengal Veterinary College during the year and duly communicated to Government. CATTLE FAIRS, SHOWS, &c. 51. Of the several fairs of Bengal, I have been able to attend three, viz., Kalimpong, Sonepur and Barahpur. I could not attend the Suri fair in the absence of sufficiently early notice. The Sitamarhi fair was visited by Mr. H. A. Foy, a Lecturer of the College. The reports of the Kalimpong, Sonepur and Sitamarhi fairs were submitted in this office letters Nos. 44 V. D., dated the 6th January 1900, 54V.D., dated the 6th January 1900, and 1154V.D., dated the 18th May 1899, respectively, and copies were for- warded to the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department. I have submitted a report of the Barahpur fair in this office letter No. 5.V.D./T., dated the 4th April 1900. The Magistrate of Shahabad has also furnished me with a copy of his report on the latter fair, from which it appears that the number of animals present at the fair was 33,403, of which 27,617 are cattle, 1,888 horses and 3,898 ponies and buffaloes, and that a sum of Its. 1,342-10-6 was realised as fees from them. The Collector of Birbhum has forwarded a report on the Suri fair, which is reproduced in condensed form in Appendix XXII. The show was held from 12th to 14th February, both days inclusive. A Committee of management was formed under the presidency of Mr. A. Ahmed, c.s., Magistrate and Collector. The show appears to have been a success, and there never seems to be any difficulty in collecting funds to support it. I have asked the President to give me earlier notice next year, so that I may attend. HORSE AND PONY BREEDING IN BENGAL. 52. Bettiah.( 16 ) order over till it was too late in the season for covering, and the consequence was that no mares were covered during the year (Appendix XXV). The donkey stallion has been taken to Luchung, and it has been arranged that he should cover as many mares as possible to give the experiment a final chance. The Political Officer is, however, strongly of opinion that it will result in failure, as none of the previous coverings have borne fruit, and recommends the removal of the donkey. The total cost of feed, keep, attendants, etc., of the donkey stallion was Rs. 223-3-6, which includes the cost of March 1899 (Appendix XXVI). CATTLE BEEEDNG. 57. Bulls were supplied to the following District Boards, Wards' Estates and other bodies during the year under report:( 17 ) TOURS. 61. I append a statement showing my tours in 1899-1900 (Appendix XXVIII), the details of which have already been reported to the Director of Land Records and Agriculture, Bengal. I was on tour for 81 days and travelled 448 miles by road, 9,470 by rail and 671 by steamer, i.e., 10,589 miles in all. STAFF. 62. Mr. E. Burke, Assistant Superintendent, has continued to give me every satisfaction. Mr. H. A. Foy, Senior Lecturer, resigned his appointment in order to take up the study of human medicine in Bombay, which offered him better propects in another career. I was sorry to lose this officer who was successful with his students. Mr. E. H. Brand has justified my hopes and has done well. Mr. Charles Engel has also been a successful teacher. Mr. Joshi was employed on probation in place of Mr. Foy and did his best, but his knowledge of practical matters was not considered to be sufficient to justify a permanent appointment.

The Superintendent of the Jail reports that during the year under report only six cows were served by the bull, four of which were without success. The Jail cattle are certainly a very fine lot, but there is no knowledge of the local breeds. The bull was appreciated by the people, but there are several good bulls of several classes in the neighbourhood. At present there is a very fine young bull, son of the above big bull, and all cows visitedlby him, this year, have become pregnant. The big Hissar bull died in August 1899 from what appeared to be intestinal colic. The bull was very old, but had done good work in his time. A half-bred son of his is covering in his stead. Half-bred English ... 1 ...... ...... Dhanwar Estate ... ... The Manager of the estate reports (1) that 16 cows were served during the year, of which 12 threw good calves, four cows having dropped immature calves; (2) that the breed is an improvement on the local cattle, and (3) that the people are too lethargic to avail themselves of the benefit of a bull. Nellore ... ... 1 Nellore ... ... July 1899 ... ... Khagra Estate ... ... The Manager of the estate reports that 15 cows were served by the bull and that it is too early to say whether the breed of cattle is improved or not. The Manager remarks that the bull is not likely to be a great success, as it is far too heavy and big for the cows of the locality, which are very small. At first many cows were brought by the raiyats, but as the bull failed to serve, few cows are being brought. In many cases, the bull refuses to look at the cow. A small bull would have been more successful. The estate has, however, a number of cows which have been served, and are being served, by the bull, and in this way it is hoped to benefit the breed of the cattle, when bulls of small type will be reared and distributed to different parts of the district. We shall be able to change this bull for a smaller one. The first or second cross will suit the district. Sitamarhi ... ... 1 Muzaffarpur ... ... May 1898 ... ... Tikari Raj Estate ... ... The Manager of the estate reports that the bull has been allowed to serve indiscriminately, as he would not serve when tied up. There is no im- provement on the local breed of cattle, as the bulls in the district are quite as good. The bull is not particularly appreciated by the people. The bull is as good as the local ones. The benefit will accrue from the importation of fresh blood into the district. Hissar ... ... 1 Government Cattle Farm, Hissar. January 1900 ... ... Banki Estate ... ... The Sub-Deputy Collector, Banki, reports (1) that as the bull arrived towards the end of January last, only six cows were served to the end of March; (2) that it is not yet time to speak of improvement in the breed of cattle, and (3) that the bull is now being appreciated by the people, and will probably be more so, when the people see the improvements expected. Behasi ... ... 2 Sitamarhi ... ... September 1895 ... Hitampore Raj ... ... The Manager of the estate reports that though the man in charge of the bulls has kept no formal record of the services done by them, yet there is suffi- cient ground to be assured that much good has been done by the pair of bulls in the estate as well as the neighbouring villages, that a large number of cows has been served, that the breed shows marked improve- ment, and that the people generally seem to have appreciated the value of improved breeding. Do. ... ... 1 Ditto ... ... June 1899 ... ... Court of wards' Estate, Backergunge. The General Manager reports that only three cows have been served by the bull, of which one died before calving and the other two are still in calf. He also remarks that the bull is not attractive. Had he been so, several cows would have been brought before him. The Manager has been asked why the bull is not attractive. Hissar ... ... 1 Hissar ... ... March 1900 ... ... Ditto ... ... ... Too early to be reported upon. Half-bred Hissar ... 1 Bhagalpur Central Jail. January 1898 ... ... Nankar Sankara Estate, Dumka. The Manager of the estate reports that 17 cows were served by the bull during the year, of which two produced female and three male calves; one failed to hold and the rest are still in calf. There is some improvement on the breed of cattle. The people appreciated the bull. Hissar ... ... 1 Hissar ... ... March 1898 ... ... Hathwa Raj Estate ... ... The Manager of the estate reports that the bull has recently served one row only. He considers the animal still too young, and therefore did not allow him to be taken advantage of by the public as yet. He will now let him be used to some extent.
( 23 ) Do. ... ... 1 Do ... ... January 1900 ... ... Kanika Estate ... ... The Manager of the estate reports that up to date some half-a-dozen cows were presented before the bull, but not one of them was served. He cannot make out why the bull does not serve any cow, though he is being pro- perly taken care of. As the bull has only recently been supplied, no final opinion can be passed this year. I have inquired if the bull can be let loose with the herds. Do ... ... 1 Do. ... ... December 1898 ... Bettiah Estate ... ... The Manager of the estate reports that, during the year under report, 13 Raj cows were served by the bull, of which three have delivered female and two male calves and the remaining eight are still pregnant. In the cases of those of the outside public who have used the bull, there appears to be Some improvement on the local breed of cattle. The bull is appreciated by the people. Darbhanga ... ... 3 Darbhanga ... ... April 1899 ... ... General Manager, Deoghur ... The General Manager reports that of the three Behari bulls, one was kept at Narainpur and Ghanti wards' estates, one at Panasi, and the other at Rohini:( 24 ) APPENDIX XXVII( 25 ) Sitamarhi ... ... 1 Muzaffarpur ... ... | July 1898 Talcher Estate, Angul ... The Manager of the Estate reports that the bull has been allowed to remain with the village cowherds, as none were willing to bring their cows to be covered at head-quarters. Under such circumstances no register could be opened for ascertaining the number of cows served during the year. The Manager says he has seen nearly 42 calves of the bull and they are good ones, but they are not superior to the calves of the big bulls there. The bull is appreciated by the people, but its height should have been higher than that of the local bulls for improvement on the breed of cattle. Ditto ... ... ... 1 Ditto ... ... May 1898 ... ... Howrah Municipality ... ... The Secretary to the Municipality reports that 150 cows were covered by the bull during the year 1899-1900. The result is unknown, as the cows came from different places, and so there is no chance to ascertain whether there is any improvement in the local breed of cattle. The bull is highly appreciated by the people. Ditto ... ... ... 1 Ditto ... ... February 1896 ... District Board, Khulna ... The Manager of the Morrelgunge Estate, in whose charge the bull is, reports that the bull has improved the local breed of cattle and is appreciated by the people; but as he remains loose among the cattle in the field, it is not certain what number of cows has been served during the year 1899-1900. Hissar ... ... ... 2 Hissar ... ... ... March 1898 ... ... Kanti Indigo concern ... The Manager reports that the Hissar bulls are not a success. They improved the first lot of calves, but the second lot is a very wretched batch. I reported upon these bulls last year and endeavoured to get a refund of money for the Manager, but wag refused. Sitamarhi ... ... 1 Muzaffarpur ... ... July 1898 ... ... Narsingpur Estate, Angul ... ... The Manager of the Estate reports that 33 cows were served during the year. The result has been generally good, and the Manager notices an appreciable improvement in the local breed. The calves are generally stout and strong. although somewhat small in size. The people do not appreciate the bull owing to the smallness of its size. Hissar ... ... ... 2 Hissar ... ... ... January 1900 ... ... Collector of Chittagong The Collector reports that the two Hissar bulls have not as yet been a success. One bull has been kept in the jail and the other is in charge of Mr. Higgins, a tea planter at Patya. Several cows have been put to each bull, but they have refused to serve them. The Patya bull is now being turned out to graze with the herd in order to see if this may accustom him to cows. The jail bull was in very poor condition, but is now much better. I have advised that they be allowed to run with the herds. Sitamarhi ... ... 2 Muzaffarpur ... ... September 1899 ... Bsibu Bhola Nath Ghosal, Landholder, Basonti. The landholder reports that to his knowledge 8 cows were served by the bulls, all of which are in calf. He also states that as the bulls are let loose among the herds, several others have certainly been served by them. The people appreciate the bulls. He further reports that 2, 3 calves produced by the former bull, which died in March 1899, are stronger and bigger in size than the local calves. Darbhanga ... ... 2 Darbhanga ... ... January 1899 ... ... Collector of Pabna ... ... The Collector reports that 62 cows were served during 1899-1900, and that the results appear to be satisfactory. Some improvement has been effected on the breed of cattle. The bulls are much appreciated by the people. Ditto ... ... 1 Darbhanga ... ... February 1899 ... ... Deputy Commissioner, Ranchi The Joint-Magistrate in charge of the Deputy Commissioner's office reports that 30 or 35 cows were served by the bull during the year. The result is not yet known, as they were served as late as June and July last. It is too early to say whether there is any improvement on the local breed. The bull does not appear to be appreciated very much by the people judging from the small number of cows served. It will probably be better appre- ciated later. Sitamarh ... ... 4 Muzaffarpur ... ... December 1898 ... District Board, Backergunge The Chairman reports that of the four bulls one has been kept at Barisal and one at each subdivisional quarters. The one sent to Bhola is incapable of serving cows either on account of physical defect or extreme youth. The three other bulls served during the year 1899-1900, 127 cows, with the result as far as ascertained in most cases successful. The breed has improved. The bulls are appreciated by the people. Ditto ... ... ... 1 Ditto ... ... May 1899 ... ... District Board, Balasore ... The Chairman reports that the bull was put to service, but refused to serve. Out of 33 cows brought to him, the bull served only one. With a view to make the bull serviceable he has been allowed to graze with the cows, but the animal remains useless, and there seems little prospect of his improv- ing. From the number of cows brought to the bull at first, it is evident that his services would have been appreciated by the people, had he not proved impotent. Half-bred Patna ... 1 Bankipore ... ... July 1894 ... ... Jessore Jail ... ... ... The Superintendent of the Jail reports that there is no record kept to show how many outside cows were served by the bull during the year 1899-1900. In the jail 28 cows were served, and there seems to be an improvement on the breed of cattle. The bull is appreciated by the people, but he is generally becoming powerless.

Read( 2 ) It is inferred, however, that all would have a greater chance of success if they received more constant support from the local authorities and enjoyed the benefit of more frequent inspections by the head of the provincial depart- ment. Veterinary-Major Raymond's opportunities for the inspection of outlying institutions were considerably lessened owing to the demands made on his time by the researches he carried on during the year with reference to rinderpest. The Lieutenant-Governor, while fully recognising the very valuable nature of these researches and the great ability with which they have been prosecuted by Major Raymond, desires that in future they may not be allowed to retard the very necessary duty of inspecting the work which is being done by veterinary assistants outside Calcutta. The most notable example of private generosity in connection with the institution of veterinary institutions is that of Kumar Rameshwar Malia and other gentlemen of Howrah, who have subscribed over Rs. 30,000 for building and endowing a dispensary. The Lieutenant-Governor trusts that it will prove to be so useful as to encourage other gentlemen elsewhere to follow this excellent example. 7.
