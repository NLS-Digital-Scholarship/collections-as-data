OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION, MADRAS, 20th July 1878. No. 2,815. From COLONEL R. M. MACDONALD, Director of Public Instruction, Madras, To THE HON. D. F. CARMICHAEL, Chief Secretary to Government, Fort Saint George. SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit the report of the Principal of the Medical College for the Session 1877-78, with the report and tabular statements of the Board of Examiners and the curriculum of the Institution. 2. COLLEGE STAFF.4 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE for the services of each graduate in medicine to be eagerly required and amply rewarded. In a more recent order, No. 65, of the 14th February 1878, Government seem to consider it rather desirable than otherwise to encourage a continuance of the system under which young men, after studying for two or three years in the Madras Medical college, proceed to Europe to complete their medical education.

The number of students in the Second Department at the commencement of the session was 68 against 37 last year. The composition of the three classes of this Department is shown in the margin. The whole of the third-year students, fifteen in number, passed their final examination before the Board of Examiners, four being placed in the first class. Of these four three were female students, Miss White, Mrs. Scharlieb, and Miss Beale, standing respectively first, second and fourth in the list. The Principal states that the proficiency of these ladies has been seldom surpassed by the alumni of the College. The Board of Examiners, while approving generally the new system of marking which has now for the first time been applied to this examination, suggest that the placing of candidates might be left in some degree to the discretion of the Examiners, who might determine which of those candidates who obtain 75 per cent. of marks should be classed in the first division. This would be an entire departure from the principle on which the present scheme is based, and I do not see on what grounds a first class could be refused to any one who had fulfilled the conditions laid down. The progress and conduct of the students in the other classes have been satisfactory, except as regards one student, who has been irregular in his attendance and has been recommended for dismissal.

The Junior Department, at the commencement of the session, contained 63 pupils against 82 last year. One of the second- year students died; the other 43 appeared before the Board of Examiners. Of these four failed; the other 39 passed for the grade of Hospital Assistant, and the Mysore students were again found superior to the other students. The Board remark, however, that "none of the candidates of this Department (with two or three doubtful exceptions) is, in his present state of knowledge and experience, fit to hold an independent charge." This is a remark which has been often made before. In the report for 1872-73 to which I have already referred, Dr. Smith and Mr. Powell both point out that when the present scheme of instruction was laid down, it was fully recognised that Native Medical pupils were not to be placed in independent professional positions involving the responsibility of human life. The students of the first year's class appear to have made satisfactory progress, and the young men of this Department are described as generally well conducted and attentive to their duties. 6.MEDALS.MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. 5 with which the teaching of the class had been carried on.

ABOLITION OF THE ELEEMOSYNARY SYSTEM OF EDUCATION IN THE COLLEGE DEPART- MENT.6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE, SESSION 1877-78. THE Forty-second Session commenced on the 2nd October 1877 and closes this day. The following changes occurred in the personnel of the College Staff:MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. 7 At the opening of the session there were on the rolls of the College 23 students in the Senior Department, 68 in the Second Department including 4 female students, and 63 in the Junior Department, in the aggregate 154; 63 of which number were young men who joined the College for the first time. SENIOR DEPARTMENT. This Department is divided into two classes, one qualifying for the M.B. and C.M. Degree of the Madras University and the other for the Licentiate Degree. The strength of these classes is as given below:8 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE registration in Great Britain or for admission to the competitive examinations for medical appointments in the army. This question deserves the consideration of Government, and the Director of Public Instruction, I feel sure, will in due time represent it. On the occasion of the distribution of prizes last year, it was announced that on the recommendation of the Surgeon-General, Indian Medical Department, the Government had sanctioned the payment of fees by individuals desirous of receiving instruction in this College to qualify either for an Indian or British Degree. In Order No. 65, dated 14th February 1878, the Government adopted the rates suggested by Dr. Smith and certain other proposals submitted by him for placing the Senior Department on a self-supporting footing. The rules fixing the rates of fees have been published in the local newspapers and in the official gazette. Under these rules a certain number of candidates will be allowed to join College in October this year. SESSIONAL EXAMINATIONS.9 MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE.

GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS. EDUCATIONAL DEPARTMENT. Read letter from the Director of Public Instruction, dated 20th July1878, No. 2,815. ORDER THEREON, 20th September 1878,No. 429. The Report on the Medical College for the year 1877-78, though dated the 24th June 1878, was not issued from the Press until the 2nd September, and did not reach the Government till the 6th idem. To guard against similar delay, the Report will, in future, be submitted to Government in manuscript and printed with their Order thereon. 1877-78. 1876-77. Senior Department 23 28 Second do. 68 37 Junior do. 63 82 Total .. 154 147 2. The aggregate number of students in the College during 1877-78 was slightly in excess of 1876-77. Taking the Depart- ments separately there was, as compared with the previous year, a falling off in the Senior and Junior Departments, and a considerable increase in the Second Depart- ment. 3. The decrease in the Senior Department is ascribed to the restriction of fresh admission, but as the order on the subject was not issued until the 4th May 1877, it could not have had the effect of excluding candidates from entering the College on the 1st of April. The Government do not see any disadvantage in students proceeding to England to finish their studies, and therefore find no reason for action in the direction suggested by the Principal of the Medical College. 4. Most of the students in the Second Department belong to the Civil branch, thirty-three being in the first year, six in the second year, and nine in the third year of collegiate training. There were also four female students, and His Grace the Governor in Council notes with pleasure the high places which they have taken in the list. The suggestion of the Examiners to be allowed some discretion in the system of classing with reference to marks does not commend itself to Government. 5. The changes sanctioned in G.O., dated the 23rd August 1878, No. 398, for the purpose of giving students in the Junior Department a longer collegiate training, will, it is hoped, effect a material improvement in results. 6. The requirements of the Professors of Materia Medica and Chemistry should be brought forward separately. 7. The eleemosynary system of education in the Medical College having been abolished, future annual reports should exhibit the receipts and expenditure of the Institution. It is satisfactory to learn that the change has not resulted in any decrease in the number of applicants for admission. 8. The Director of Public Instruction will convey to the Principal and Professors of the Medical College the thanks of Government for their labors in connection with this important institution. (Signed) C. G. MASTER, Acting Chief Secretary.

MASTER, ESQ., Acting Chief Secretary to Government, Fort Saint George. SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit the report of the Principal of the Medical College for the Session 1878-79, with the report and tabular statements of the Board of Examiners, the curriculum of the institution, and the accounts of receipts and disbursements. 2. COLLEGE STAFF.4 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE report unfavorably both on this and on the Junior Classes of this department. Altogether there appears to have been a good deal of levity and unsteadiness, which the Principal ascribes to the increasing numbers, to the large proportion of Civil students in the institution, and to the abolition of the punishment of solitary confinement, save in the case of Military Apprentices. A private practitioner, who was allowed to appear before the Board of Examiners with the third-year students, was found totally incompetent. It will be observed that no female students are now studying in the Second Department. Junior Department 1st Year. 2nd Year. Civil Medical Pupils 21 23 Private Students 1 1 Mysore Pupils 8 ...

The 24 second-year men appeared before the Board of Examiners and 19 passed for the grade of 3rd-class Hospital Assistant. Five were rejected. Fifty-six students from the Royapuram Auxiliary Medical School were also examined on this occasion. The Principal considers that the students of this department have done as well as can be expected of youths of such inferior attainments in English as the majority of them are, but expects better results under the new curriculum, which will be one extending over three years. 6. CHEMIST AND DRUGGIST.MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. 5 join the College on that date. They enter at the beginning of the academical year, viz., at the beginning of October. The annual report of the Medical College has hitherto been one relating to the academical and not to the official year, and this point has always been noticed in the annual reports on Public Instruction. The present report is one of the usual kind, and I have been in some doubt how I should deal with it, as Government Order No. 663, of the 30th April 1879, directs the submission of the report in print for the official year, whereas Govern- ment Order No. 429, of the 20th September 1878, directs that the report shall be submitted in manuscript and does not allude to any change being made in the period to which the report is to relate. It would be a great convenience in many ways if the academical year could be made to correspond either with the official or with the calendar year. The Matriculation and F.A. Examinations are held in December to enable all colleges and schools to form new classes in January, and the annual course ends in December. Last year a great number of students left the Doveton College several weeks before the end of the year for the purpose of joining the Medical College, and the Principal of the Doveton College complains in his last report of the great injury which the students sustained by having their studies interrupted at this critical period. I have had a conversation with Dr. Furnell on this subject, and as far as I can learn at present, there does not seem to be any sufficient reason for this institution working on different lines from the Arts Colleges, but the matter is one which will require further consideration. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, R. M. MACDONALD, Director of Public Instruction.
6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE, SESSION 1878-79. THE Forty-third Session, closing this day, was opened on the 2nd of October 1878, with an aggregate of 182 students on the rolls, 96 of which were fresh admissions. The changes that have taken place in the teaching staff since the commence- ment of the year under review are as follows:MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. 7 THE FIRST OR SENIOR DEPARTMENT. The numerical strength of the classes of this department at the beginning of the year was as follows:8 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECOND DEPARTMENT. In this department there were 87 apprentices at the opening of the session. One (Apprentice Eyles) has since been removed from the service, and another (Apprentice C. Kannan) died on the 29th June 1878 at Cannanore, whither he had proceeded for the benefit of his health. The Hospital Apprentices who completed their course of study, 11 in number including the 5 apprentices in the service of the Government of the Straits Settle ment, appeared before a board of Medical Officers to be examined as to their fitness for the grade of Assistant Apothecary; all were reported qualified. These will receive this day their qualification certificates. A Mahomedan gentleman who for some years attended the lectures at the College and the wards of the clinical hospital, obtained permission to appear before this board for examination in view to obtaining a certificate to practise the medical profession. He was examined, and I am sorry to say he failed to satisfy the Examiners as to his fitness for practice. The examining board makes the following remarks in regard to this class:MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. 9 is why failure has been the result at the annual examination in chemistry, the percentage of marks gained being only 29. The levity and irregularity of conduct mentioned have not escaped my attention, although it has not occurred in my own class; but there has been some little attempt at insubordination, which in one case (Eyles) led to expulsion. It arises from two causes, one is the increased number of students, which naturally increases the number also of idle and noisy youths, and the loss of the sharp and severe punish- ment of "solitary confinement," which in former years always rapidly brought to reason any refractory student. Although always loth to use this form of punish- ment, I perceive now it is gone (save to Military Apprentices) that the Principal has lost his most effectual remedy for indiscipline. The members of the class referred to by the Professors of Midwifery, Ophthal- mology and Medical Jurisprudence have, without any exception, been reported qualified by the Final Examination Committee. This success, though fairly achieved, cannot however be considered as relieving the youths of blame for failure to render their teachers satisfaction. It is to be hoped that these students will in future so take advantage of opportunities as to fit themselves in a greater degree for the discharge of such duties as they may be called upon to perform. Students of classes continuing in College are warned that, as heretofore, no negligence or want of intelligence on their part will ever be overlooked. The instances of deficient attainments and irregular conduct reported to have occurred amongst them will be dealt with by the Principal. With reference to Professor Brockman's remarks on the junior class attending the course in Physiology, I would here remark that these youths are not expected to attain the same degree of proficiency as those who have gone through a second course. A general but sound acquaintance with the leading facts of physiology, so as to enable them to enter with profit on the study of medicine during their second year, is absolutely necessary and should be imparted. The acquirement of the minutiæ of physiology10 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE The students of this department have done as well as can be expected of youths of such inferior attainments in English as the great majority of them are. The present classes are in no way superior to the classes that have left this College to enter upon their duties as Hospital Assistants during several years past. The training of the next year's junior class, with the exception of one section, will be conducted in conformity with the curriculum sanctioned by Government in their order No. 41, dated 7th February 1879. According to this curriculum the period of study will extend over three years, and the teaching during the first two will be conducted almost exclusively by the Assistants, and during the third year by the Professors and Assistants conjointly. Better results than those hitherto obtained are expected to accrue from this system. The conduct of the students of this department has been good. The percentage gained at the annual examination is as follows:MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. 11 REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF EXAMINERS APPOINTED IN G.O., No. 211, OF 29TH MAY 1879. President.

GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS. EDUCATIONAL DEPARTMENT. Read letter from the Director of Public Instruction, dated 10th July 1879, No. 2895. ORDER THEREON, 5th August 1879, No. 305. The Report on the Medical College for 1878-79 has been submitted to Govern- ment two months earlier than the report for the year 1877-78. This is satisfac- tory. Senior Department 43 Second do. 86 Junior do. 54 Total 183 2. The aggregate number of students in the College was twenty-nine in excess of the number in 1877-78, and thirty- six of that in 1876-77. 3. In the Senior Department there was an increase of twenty, and in the Second Department of eighteen, but in the Junior Department there was a decrease of nine. 4. In the Senior Department there were seven students preparing for the M.D. Degree, and thirty-six for the L.M. and S. Degree. Of the former, two appeared for examination but failed and left the College. One died after passing the preliminary examination. Nine students left the department during the year to proceed to England to finish their studies. 5. Of the students in the Second Department, one was removed for miscon- duct. The department, as a whole, is reported to have been very inferior, but the reasons assigned do not appear altogether to justify the result. 6. The Junior Department consisted of thirty first-year, and twenty-four second year, students. Of the former, nineteen passed for the grade of Third-class Hospital Assistants, and five were rejected. 7. One private student has been declared qualified as a Chemist and Druggist. 8. The Johnston Medal was not awarded. The Blacklock Medal was given to A. N. Wray, Civil Hospital Apprentice, and the Government Gold Medal to Robert Gray, Medical Pupil. 9. The suggestion in paragraph 8 of the Director's letter will be brought forward separately for the consideration of Government. 10. The receipts from fees are shown to have amounted to Rupees 4,115. The charges to Rupees 41,360. The proportion of the contribution of Rupees 33,000 from Local Funds to be taken to the exclusive credit of the College should be determined. Unless this is done the aggregate receipts cannot be set off against the aggregate expenditure, and no inference can be fairly drawn as to how far the College is likely to be self-supporting. 11. The period for which the Medical College Report should be rendered should be considered and determined in consultation with the Surgeon-General, Indian Medical Department. Nearly all the reports embodied in the General Administra- tion Report of the Presidency are for the official year, and from what is stated by the Director there seems no reason why the Medical College Report should not, in future, be rendered for the same period. 12. The Government endorse the opinion expressed by the Director regarding the manner in which Dr. Harris discharged his duties as Professor of Midwifery, &c., and congratulate the Principal and Professors of the College on the success which has generally attended their labors during the year.

4 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE, SESSION 1879-80. THE College was opened for its forty-fourth Session on the 1st October 1879; 228 students were on the books (46 more than at the opening of the previous Session), of whom 77 were newly admitted. 2. Certain changes in the personnel of the professional staff took place during the year. Surgeon-Major H. King, A.M., M.B., was succeeded in the chair of Chemistry by Surgeon T. K. Rogers, M.B.; Surgeon McNally, M.D., became Professor of Hygiene on the 1st July 1879; Surgeon C. Sibthorpe, Professor of Pathology, returned from field service in Afghanistan on the 27th July, and proceeded on privilege leave on the 3rd September, resuming his duties on the 6th December, the temporary vacancy having been filled by Surgeon A. J. Sturmer; on the 1st November Surgeon-Major L. C. Nanney was succeeded in the chair of Materia Medica (under G.O., No. 381, of 6th October 1879,) by Professor McNally, who continues to teach two subjects. The Principal, Surgeon-Major M. C. Furnell, M.D., having been appointed Sanitary Commissioner, assumed charge of his new office on the 6th April and was succeeded by Surgeon-Major H. King who rejoined the College on the 5th May. 3. Particulars of the teaching which has been given during both Sessions will be found in the table subjoined:MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. first year. Three gentlemen of this division presented themselves for the first M.B. Examination last July, of whom two, Messrs. H. F. Staunton and N. Jesudasen Pillay, were successful. One student went up for the Preliminary Scientific Examination and failed. 6. The second division, Senior Department, included 8 students in their fourth year of study, 3 in the third, 21 in the second, and 10 in the first-42 in all. Six, Messrs. J. G. Margenout, C. LaFrenais, J. Ebell, R. Dique, V. P. Mhatre, and S. A. Talpade, passed their first examination for the Licence in July. 7. The F.A. of an Indian University is an indispensable qualification for admission to the first division of the Senior Department, and the Matriculation Test for admission to the second. There has, however, been an exception allowed during the past year as a special case. A student was admitted into the second division from the Travancore State in anticipation of his passing the Matriculation Examination6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE 16. With reference to the Final Examination I may remark that the present is the only occasion within the range of my experience in which the examination has been entirely conducted by the Board appointed for the purpose. I have no doubt that this method of testing the knowledge of our pupils not only carries out the intention of Government, but is intrinsically preferable to the system of partially delegating the duty of examining to the Professors who have been the teachers. I offer the best thanks of my colleagues and my own to the gentlemen who con- stituted, this year, the Examining Board, for the patience and considerateness with which they performed their laborious and unremunerated task. Their report is appended. 17. In addition to the primary work of the College nine young men were instructed in the branches of science necessary for qualification as Chemists and Druggists. Of these 5 gentlemen were examined by a Board of Professors and 4 were declared qualified. 18. In the year 1869-70, in which my own connexion with the College began, the number of students of all departments under instruction was 126; in 1879-80 it was 228. This enormous increase could not fail to be attended with inconveni- ence in some way. I shall notice only two points, the former of considerable though minor importance. The supply of material for the teaching of Anatomy and Operative Surgery has become inadequate. Thus only 25 subjects were avail- able for dissections during the Winter Session, while 50 would be required for the Senior and Second Departments alone, according to the scale adopted by our schools at home. During the Summer Session only nine subjects were available for the Operative Surgery class, a number which the Professor of Surgery considers quite insufficient for the practical instruction of his swollen classes. The establishment of the Auxiliary School at Royapuram, which requires material of this nature for its own use, is one cause of the diminished supply to this institution. In so large a city as ours death is always busy, and there is no lack of the poor and friendless whose bodies after death may be made useful to their fellow creatures. I trust that we shall be able to obtain the co-operation of our brother officers in charge of hospitals in overcoming the difficulty I have mentioned. 19. A more serious difficulty, and one which we are ourselves powerless to overcome, is the great and growing insufficiency of teaching power. Although the number of students has increased twofold no addition whatever, with the trifling exception of provision for the clinical instruction of a few extra pupils in the General Hospital, has been made to our educational staff. It is, indeed, approxi- mately as easy to lecture to fifty students as to ten, but our system of instruc- tion, wisely devised and most successful, involves frequent class examinations. One meeting in every three is devoted to examination. When a class exceeds 25 an hour's examination is practically useless. The class must be divided and part of it examined by an Assistant. I have no hesitation in saying that our system of teaching is becoming disorganized through want of an increased number of Assist- ants. During the past Session the Professor of Physiology with a class of 91 had no Assistant at all. I trust that the need of increased Assistant staff has only to be brought to the notice of Government to be supplied. A large and increasing proportion of our students pay no inconsiderable fees for professional instruction and are entitled to the best that can be bestowed. In the past year Rs. 5,920 were received and credited to Government from this source. 20. Professor Brockman makes a suggestion which meets with my approval, viz., that students of the Second Department should attend, as the former of their two courses of Physiology, the Assistant's lectures with the Junior Department pupils. I have long been more than doubtful of the advantage of requiring students to attend two or more identical courses of lectures in one subject; but without entering into the general question I may express my concurrence in Professor Brockman's opinion that the Second Department would derive more advantage from the Professor's course if it had previously learned more elementary physiology from the Assistant. 21. The College Library contains now 5,625 volumes, of which 117 were added in the past year. I have always regretted that this valuable collection of
7 MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. professional works should be practically restricted in its use to the Professors. So far as lies with me I shall always be glad to extend its usefulness to our professional brethren unconnected with the College, in any way not inconsistent with the due preservation of the books. 22. Thirty-five specimens were added to our Museum during the year. It is intended to ask the Surgeon-Generals' aid in obtaining more numerous contributions from our brethren in the mofussil. 23. The Johnstone Medal was awarded to Private Student C. A. Lafrenais; the Blacklock to Civil Hospital Apprentice J. W. Wright, and the Government Gold Medal to Civil Medical Pupil R. A. Ellupen of the Auxiliary Medical School under G.O., No. 316, dated 13th August 1879. 24. The cost of the Medical College during 1879-80 was Rs. 48,765-0-1, of which, as already stated, Rs. 5,920 was contributed as students' fees. HENRY KING, A.M., M.B., 29th, June 1880.

(m) are concerned may well be referred for consideration to the Committee, the appointment of which I have had the honor to recommend in my letter, No. N-345, dated 19th August 1881, although primarily the duties of that Committee would be connected with the scheme of teaching in the. Second Department and with the Junior Department only. 13. Although it is unusual to discuss important special recommendations in Annual Administration Reports, yet I would note briefly upon two especially of the above changes proposed which come under the heads marked (b) and (c). (b.) It is here proposed. to omit all courses which are not required for the three examinations comprising the M.B. and C.M. course in the Madras University, thus relieving both teachers and students from what, the Principal considers, an unnecessary amount of work. The throwing of an undue burthen on both students and Professors is no doubt undesirable, and if it were proved that the subjects prescribed by the University and. the standard fixed in each demand the knowledge essential for the degree in Medicine, I would be quite ready to adopt Dr. King's suggestion, but to my mind before any change can be introduced experts must settle this question. But generally there can be no doubt that the courses should, as far as practicable, be assimilated, as in this Presidency, at least, a medical degree does not represent, as in England, special scientific culture in medicine, as opposed to that imparted in Medical Schools, and certified by the Royal College of Surgeons, &c. 14. The most important of Dr. King's proposals is that connected with the section 6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE useful in their profession than if they had never left it. Again it must not be forgotten. that from a student's stand-point a British degree is of more value than a Madras degree, for it enables him to practice, I believe, in any part of the British Empire, and therefore it is only natural that they, who possess the means, should seek to obtain it in preference to a Madras degree7 MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE, SESSION 1880-81. THE forty-fifth academical year opened on the 4th October 1880 with 194 students on the books. Two were admitted as special cases in December and 2 students at the commencement of the Summer Session; 64 were new admissions. The corresponding numbers at the beginning of the previous year were 228 and 77. Of the 194 students, 64 belonged to the Senior Department, whose curricula are adapted to the requirements of the University for its Medical Degrees; 79 to the Second Department, which consists of candidates for the Apothecary grade; 46 to the Junior Department studying for the Hospital Assistant qualification; and 5 entered to attend certain courses necessary for qualification as Chemists and Druggists. 2. No change took place in the College staff since last report, except that Professor W. R. Browne, M.D., was appointed to the chair of Pathology in place of Professor Sibthorpe, who obtained 20 months' leave. 3. The following table shows the nature and extent of the College teaching during the past year:- Subjects. Meetings. Lectures. Examinations. Proportion of Examination to Meetings.

The working days of the Winter Session were 120. On 9 of these the College was closed8 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE 5. In 1879 the Acting Surgeon-General, moved with compassion for the over- lectured students, recommended to Government, with the concurrence of the Prin- cipal, that either a fortnight should intervene between the Winter and Summer Sessions, or that the Easter holidays should be extended to 14 days. The latter alternative was accepted in G.O., No. 342, dated 8th September 1879. The Summer Session (which generally includes the Easter holidays), normally short, is thus still further shortened, and is insufficient for the work allotted to it. I recommend that in future years the College be closed at Easter only during the ordinary Government holidays. 6. The Senior Department, theoretically consisting of candidates for the Medi- cal Degrees of the University of Madras, is consequently divided into two sections studying respectively for the M.B. and C.M. and for the L.M.S. Degrees. 7. The senior section included 16 students-7 in the first, 5 in the second, 2 in the third, and 2 in the fifth years of professional study. The last two present themselves next month at the Degree Examination. Five passed the preliminary Scientific Examination of the University last July, and 9 are about to go up for it. Two others will go up for the First M.B. and C.M. 8. The junior section included 46 students when the year began-14 in the first, 9 in the second, 20 in the third, and 3 in the fourth year of professional study. One student resigned on account of ill-health, 1 died from the result of a lament- able accident, and 5 students sailed for Europe to complete there their medical education. Two appear at the coming University Second Examination for the License in Medicine and Surgery and 6 for the First Examination. Six candi- dates who went up for the License last year were successful, and of 3 who presented themselves for the First Examination 2 passed 9. The following table, giving the average percentage of marks obtained by the classes of the Senior Department at the College Class Examinations held at the close of each Session, shows that the progress of the students was satisfactory:MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. 9 junior section of our Senior Department. Some four or five years ago it pleased the University to lower its requirements in medical education by offering a License in Medicine and Surgery to matriculated students after four years' professional study, of which only three needed to be collegiate. I have always thought the measure a mistake, and should have much preferred a revival of the quasidegree of the Medical College. However, the degree was instituted mainly, if not solely, for the purpose, as its advocates alleged, of supplying the Presidency with educated practitioners. How it has fulfilled the object which alone would have justified its existence the following figures show: 56 students have joined our L.M.S. section since its institution. Of these 5 resigned and 1 died, and 9 have graduated, while 19 have gone to England to compete for commissions in the army. Of the 22 remaining on the College books, it is notorious that a very large proportion will be classed, not with the 9, but with the 19. Such a state of things was not the aim of those who advocated the institution of the License, nor is it in itself desirable. 14. No one could wish less than I to exclude gentlemen of any race from the public services of their country, but I say plainly that a standard of general education and culture higher than the Matriculation test of the local University marks is necessary to Medical Officers if they are to mix on equal terms, socially and intellectually, with members of the other services. It is more than questionable whether the degree of education represented by Matriculation is a sufficiently firm or wide foundation for the professional superstructure which we strive to build upon it, especially since the Senate, in its wisdom, has dispensed with a knowledge of Latin; but there can be no doubt at all that the average matriculate is not educated up to the level of average members of the classes with whom the Commis- sioned Medical Officer will, or at least should, associate. 15. I propose, therefore, that our Senior Department in its junior section be restricted to the duty for which it was instituted, viz., the preparation of students for the University License, and I recommend that certificates of attendance upon lectures, &c., in this section be issued, not to the candidates, but to the Registrars of the University on his application. 16. When the year opened there were 80 students in the Second Department; all but one stipended and being educated gratuitously for the service of the State. Of these 36 (12 Military, 22 Civil, and 2 Colonial) were in their third and final year of study; 29 in their second (12 Military, 16 Civil, and 1 Colonial); and 13 Civil and 1 Colonial Hospital Apprentice were in their first year. The first group of this class has just appeared before the Final Examining Board and 26 passed, besides a private student specially permitted by Government to appear. 17. The opening of this department to private students, which I recom- mended and Government sanctioned, has been so far a failure. One matriculated student entered, but went up into the L.M.S section at the commencement of the Summer Session. Several others applied for admission, but, not having matriculated, were excluded. Application was made to Government to relax the qualification so far as to allow candidates to defer Matriculation until the December of their precollegiate year. The indulgence was refused. 18. The progress of the students of the Second Department is shown by the following table of percentages obtained in each subject at the College Exam- inations:10 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE moderate scale sanctioned for private students of the Second Department should be paid by all ladies henceforward entering on the pre-collegiate course. 21. The Junior Department included 15 students in their first and 31 in their second years of study. Of the latter, 22 were in the pay of the Madras Govern- ment, 8 of the Mysore, and 1 of the Pudukóta States. The Mysore pupils will, it is understood, join the Bangalore Medical School in October. Of the 15 pupils who entered last October, 8 were from Mysore, and 7 were private students paying fees for their education. In consequence of the recent orders, that students of this department should spend three years in College instead of two, none of this class appeared before the Final Examining Board. 22. The result of the College Examinations of this department are subjoined:11 MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. "I beg to propose that the six students be called Assistant Demonstrators; that their services in the Dissecting Room entitle them to receive certificates of Practical Anatomy for the Session in which they are employed; and that each of them, on completing his work satisfactorily, should receive an honorarium of 30 rupees. "It is simply impossible that one Demonstrator can, under existing arrangements, do all the work that is expected of him. The higher practical teaching can still be conducted by him under the supervision and guidance of the Professor, but much of the elementary work ought to be entrusted to advanced students. By this arrangement the Senior Dissectors will get all the help they possibly can from the Professor and Demonstrator, and the Junior Dissectors will, in like manner, receive suitable help from students more advanced than themselves, as also from the Professor and Demonstrator." I recommend that four Assistant Demonstrators be sanctioned on the conditions suggested by Professor Keess. 28. The Professor of Surgery has several grievances which I would gladly have redressed. In the first place he has no Assistant capable of aiding him in the examination of his class. He says:12 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE 32. The Professor of Physiology again urges the need of assistance in teaching his class, which numbered 63 at the opening of the Winter Session. I have already recommended the appointment of another Assistant. Professor Brockman says:13 MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. (b) That certain courses of lectures not required for the Madras University Degrees of L.M.S. and M.B. and C.M. be omitted from the curricula of the junior and senior sections of the Senior Department. (c) That certificates qualifying for examination for the License in Medicine and Surgery be not issued to candidates, but forwarded to the Regis- trar of the University. (d) That female students entering on professional study in or after October next be called upon to pay College fees on the scale laid down for private students of the Second Department. (e) That Professors in future appointed to chairs from which, by University or other requirements, two courses of lectures are delivered be expected to provide two separate courses instead of one repeated. (f) That four Demonstrators in Anatomy be appointed from senior students to assist in the teaching of Practical Anatomy, 2 to attend in the dissecting-room from October to December, the other 2 from Janu- ary to March, each to receive a honorarium of Rs. 30. (g) That an additional Assistant be appointed to aid the Professor of Surgery and Physiology and perform other duties which may be assigned to him. (h) That the Junior Surgeon sanctioned by Government be appointed to the General Hospital as a fourth clinical teacher before the opening of the Winter Session. (i) That the Surgery courses be combined into one, extending from October to the close of the Summer Session. (j) That a suitable operating theatre be built at the General Hospital. (k) That the courses in Midwifery and Diseases of Women and Children be similarly amalgamated. (l) That the first two-fifths of the lectures in Chemistry be devoted to Che- mical Physics and the last fifth to Elementary Organic Chemistry. (m) That two courses in Medical Jurisprudence be delivered in future, one in the Winter Session to students of the Senior and Second Departments and the other to the Junior Department students in the Summer Session. 37. Fifty-seven books were added to the library and 64 pathological specimens to the museum in 1880-81. 38. The Johnstone Medal was awarded by the College Council to Mr. H. Staunton as the most deserving student of the year. The Blacklock Medal for Clinical Surgery was awarded to Mr. F. St. J. Lawrence of the Second Department, to which it is at present restricted; the Chipperfield Medal for Clinical Medicine (unfortunately not yet available for presentation) to Mr. N. Jesudasen Pillay of the Senior Department. Two candidates, Messrs. Saldanha and Winckler, obtained equal marks for the Cornish Clinical Prize of Rs. 100, which will, therefore, be divided between them. The Government Medal falls to V. Venkayya, the student of the Hospital Assistant grade who passed first at the Final Examination. The competition this year did not include any students from the College. 39. The cost of the College in 1880-81, estimated according to G.O., No. 965, dated 31st May 1881, amounted to Rs. 69,596-10-7. Rs. 8,744-15-9 were received as fees and from other sources. 40. I avail myself of this my last public opportunity to thank my colleagues and assistants, not merely for efficient aid in performing our common duties, but also for the smoothness and harmony with which our work has been carried on.

GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS. EDUCATIONAL DEPARTMENT. Read the following paper:26 10. The Government cannot entertain the proposal to refuse certificates which students have earned in order to check the exodus to Medical Colleges in Europe of men whose general education is considered illiberal, and no doubt is justly so con- sidered. Means may be taken to enforce a higher standard in this direction; but meanwhile the Government cannot but think with the Director that the check suggested would be highly impolitic and opposed to the good of the country; such students necessarily bring back with them a wider range of knowledge and experience, the application of which cannot but be beneficial to the community at large. 11. As regards proposals (b), (e), (i), (k), (l) and (m), the Government resolve to refer them for the consideration and report of the Committee appointed by G.O., No. 314, dated 24th September 1881. The question of raising the educational qualifi- cation for admission into the L.M.S. class will also be considered by the Committee. (True Extract.) (Signed) B. DAVIDSON, Chief Secretary.

The serious difficulty of carrying on the class examinations (at least one in three meetings) in classes numbering 90 to 100 students has been overcome in this way. Students attending their second course of Medicine are divided into two classes, examined half by the Professor, half by the Assistant, who take the classes alternately after each group of six lectures has been delivered. Students attending their first course are similarly divided and similarly examined after every two lectures. All students, except those under examination by the Assistant, attend the Professor's examinations. 4. The Junior Department students are examined once a week by the Assistant. 5. Dies have been prepared for the Chipperfield Medal, which is to be awarded annually for Clinical Medicine, and the medal was awarded for the first time in 1881. 6. Brief clinical lectures have been delivered once a week in the General Hospital to the students attending in the Medical Wards. 7. Anatomy.7 MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE, SESSION 1881-82. THE forty-sixth session of the Madras Medical College closes this day. The session opened on 1st October last with 226 students on the rolls, of whom 82 belonged to the First or Senior Department, i.e., of those preparing for University Degrees; 67 to the Second Department, composed of apprentices study- ing for the appointment of Military and Civil Apothecary, and 77 to the Third or Junior Department, consisting of pupils qualifying for the position of Hospital Assistant. In addition to the 226 students, there were 6 lady students who entered the College to study Medicine. One is on the rolls of the Senior Department, and the others are attached to the Second Department.

The students of this department were, on the whole, well behaved, regular in their attendance, and, with a few exceptions, made good progress in their studies. Two students ceased to attend at the very commencement of the session, having apparently given up all intention of following Medicine as a profession. Five left Madras to continue their education in the Medical Schools of Great Britain. Two of the students of this department are Government free scholars9 MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE.

The charges connected with the College were Rs. 81,185 against Rs. 69,596 in the previous year. The large excess should have been explained. This will now be done. 10. The suggestion in regard to the course of lectures on midwifery and diseases of women and children has, it is observed, been approved among other recommenda- tions in G.O., No. 228, of the 23rd instant.

Acting Chief Secretary to Government, Fort St. George. SIR, I have the honor to submit the annual report of the Medical College for 1882-83, together with my review, printed in Proceedings, No. 6074, of the 1st September 1883. 2. I beg to request that the Secretary of State may be moved to supply the articles mentioned in paragraph 11 of my review as early as possible. 3. The Principal proposes that the primary examination should take place at the end of the second summer session instead of at the close of the second winter session. As the change appears to be necessary in the circumstances stated by the Principal, I would recommend it for the sanction of Government. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, H. B.

The Primary Examination will, hereafter, be held at the close of the Winter term agreeably to rule. Of twenty students, including four Female pupils who appeared for the Primary Examina- tion, the Board found twelve qualified.

The examinations are conducted by officers appointed by Government. The rules for their guidance sanctioned by authority are appended to this report. The officers who were appointed to undertake this duty are10 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE studies, he suggests that, to entitle a student to a certificate, he be required to obtain a certain percentage of examination marks also. This matter was discussed at a Council meeting of the Professors at the time when certain rules framed by Dr. King, the Principal, were being recon- sidered, and it was unanimously decided to abrogate the rule which insisted on a certain percentage of marks being obtained, in addition to regular attendance, in order to qualify for a certificate for the course. The Professor of Materia Medica is of opinion that a previous knowledge of Chemistry, Physiology and Anatomy is essential to enable students to grasp even the most rudimentary principles of Therapeutics. Concurring generally with him, as I do, it is my intention to recommend a change that would meet the wishes of the Professor. Professor Drake-Brockman, in his report on the class of Microscopy, says that he labored under great disadvantages owing chiefly to the inadequate supply of Microscopes, apparatus, re-agents and suitably prepared material from which to make sections, as well as on account of insufficient room to accommodate a large class and, for these reasons, he suggests that the L.M.S. Students be excluded from the course until such time as the College is better prepared to take up the teaching of a large number. Besides third year M.B. Students who, hitherto, alone attended this class, it was decided, this year, to include in it all second year students of the Second Department going up for the Primary Examination and such L.M. Students who were were willing to learn something of the Microscope. The full number authorized to attend could not, however, do so this year, because the Professor was of opinion that the Microscopes, Apparatus and Chemicals available in the College were insufficient. A requisition has been submitted for more Microscopes and other necessaries and it is hoped that these will be duly supplied and the College better equipped by next Session so that, hereafter, the Professor of this subject will be in a position to instruct the full complement of students, and with greater satisfaction to himself. The Professor remarks that the course included the following subjects:MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. 11 possesses a small ship's boat to carry four, an Oxford scull boat and a double-oar Oxford scull. With these, they make excursions to Ennore and other summer resorts. The receipts have been Rs. 389, the expenditure Rs. 374, leaving a small balance to be carried on to the next Session, when it is the intention of the students to enlarge their operations. When we get a gymnasium with suitable apparatus and an Instructor, more attention will be paid to the physical development of the pupils. Throughout the Session efforts have also been made to maintain discipline among the students and to inculcate a sense of duty. These efforts have, with ones apparent exception, been successful. Every encouragement has been given to efforts which have in view the formation of esprit de corps among our students. One of these has succeeded well, namely, the "Students' Reading Club." Fifty students subscribed 96 rupees during the Session and took in several professional journals and newspapers. They manage their own affairs, the only interference being that no journal is taken in without the Principal's previous sanction. Students' Reading Room.12 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Settlements.

Harvey, F.R.C.S., F.C.S., joined the college as an assistant in 1862 and rendered efficient aid to those under whom he worked. He was appointed to the chair of Medical Jurisprudence in 1875, an appointment to which he did great credit. By his death the college has lost an experienced teacher who exercised much influence, for good, over the students. Honorary Surgeon W. Hamilton, F.C.S., joined the college as an assistant in 1867. By his death the college has lost the services of a careful and efficient teacher. K. Ramasawmy Naidu, an exceedingly promising student of the M.B. class in his third year of study, to the great regret of all, succumbed to a low form of fever attended with brain symptoms. He was the holder of the Maharajah of Cochin's scholarship. Student Graham joined the college on the 1st October last and came to us with a reputation for hard work. During his four months' connection with the college he gave promise of success, but his career, much to the regret of those who knew him, was cut short by a severe attack of typhoid fever. 4.

The number of candidates going up this year for the M.B. and L.M. exam- inations is large and includes twenty-two of our Second department youths who, though they succeeded in passing satisfactorily the departmental test, yet prefer the University recognition of their professional acquirementsMADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. 9 will go up next year for the First M.B. and C.M. examination and the latter for the First L.M. and S. examination. Miss Ramsbotham of the third year, Second department, appeared for the Final examination, for the college certificate, and the Government Board of Examiners have pronounced her qualified to undertake the work of a "medical practitioner." Misses Yerbury, Smith and Stewart appeared for the First or Primary examination before the same Board and all three passed creditably. Misses Govindurajulu, Jacobsz and Gurdial Sing have just completed their first year of study. The entrance standard for female candidates wishing to enter the college to qualify for the college certificate is now the Higher Examination for Women. 12. In accordance with G.O., No. 677, of 9th October 1883, the pre-collegiate year for students of the Second department has been abolished, and the college training extended to four years, a change which has enabled the College Council to divide the period of instruction into two equal parts, the first two years being devoted to the subjects of the Primary examination and the last two to those of the final. The system of gratuitously educating young men as Apothecaries will soon cease, Government having abolished the Second department (G.O., No. 1079, of 13th May 1884). Apprentices who entered the Second department under the old rules and who are now under instruction, will continue in college until they qualify for the grade of Civil Apothecary; but from a date which will be hereafter fixed, no Apprentices will be admitted under regulations now in force, and education will be given at this college to those only who pay for it. This change does not affect the female classes qualifying for degrees and certificates. 13.

During the past year several students proceeded to Europe to continue their studies there. The training at this college fully qualifies a student to obtain not only a degree of the local University, but also a diploma in Medicine and Surgery of Colleges in Great Britain; but, owing to the fact that Indian degrees are not registrable there, many of our students find it expedient to complete their course in Europe where they, doubtless, enjoy greater facilities for acquiring a knowledge of diseases prevalent in cold climates and ideas as well that are current at the various medical schools which, it must be admitted, give them a better chance of succeeding at English examinations. This is why our University pass lists do not correctly represent the character and amount of work done at this college. 18. MedalsMADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. 11 diploma granted by this college. His Highness also gives a gold medal yearly to the best female student in Midwifery. The encouragement thus given by His Highness the Maharajah to female education will be as highly appreciated by the public as it has been by Government. 23. As the gratuitous education of young men for service under the various Local Fund Boards and Municipalities will soon cease, it is to be hoped that the wealthy members of the community may be induced to come forward and institute scholarships for the encouragement of medical education. At the Grant Medical College, Bombay, there are many scholarships and prizes founded by the public there. As regards endowments in our own city, I prefer to remain silent. 24.

Three Hospital Apprentices appeared for their Final examination along with three Female candidates. Of the 33 candidates who presented them- selves for the Primary examination, all, without exception, obtained more than half marks; but in the case of the three following candidates, the Examining Medical Board found that each one of them, while securing more than half marks on the whole, failed to obtain the required one-third marks in one subject only. As they have done remarkably well in all other subjects, the College Council has recom- mended that they be permitted to enter on their third year's study, with the proviso that they be required to attend a course on the subjects they failed in before the Examining Committee and that they be permitted to go up again for examination next year in the one subject in which they failed: 8 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Subjects Meetings.

It is in these laboratories that, in the near future, we hope our most advanced students and others interested in the well-being of their fellow-creatures will be employed in making researches and independent observations, just as some of the leading minds are now engaged in some of the great schools of Europe, and thus assist in shedding a clearer light than is now vouchsafed to us on the path of those who may come after them. Seeing how intimately the well-being of the public is bound up with this institution, I would fain hope that the time is not far distant when wealthy philan- thropists will be able to see their way to instituting research scholarships which will encourage scientific investigation and enable highly-trained medical graduates of our Universities to spend a portion of their career in prosecuting inquiries in the wide field of causation and treatment of morbid states, and in their practice testing the value of the numerous indigenous drugs which are reputed to be efficacious in the treatment of disease. I am led to believe that a large number of educated and influential Native gentlemen share in this hope and, as this is so, I trust that ere long the view here expressed may take a practical shape. On an occasion like this, it may not be inappropriate to refer to the able and zealous officers who have rendered valuable services as teachers and administrators to this institution since its foundation. Pre-eminently among them are some who have passed away, but their services are nevertheless not forgotten. Among these are the honored names of Dr. William Mortimer, the founder of this institution and its first able and distinguished Superintendent, whose portrait, I regret to say, is not among those that adorn these walls; his coadjutor and afterwards his successor, Dr. George Harding, who also left his mark on this school. Professor Thomas Key, the first Professor of Chemistry, whose interest in its progress was marked. Dr. Ambrose Blacklock, an original teacher, large-hearted as he was large-minded. Professor Chipperfield, who, for his great attainments, whilst still young in the service, was selected to fill the chair of Anatomy and Physiology and subsequently that of Medicine. Among those who are still alive and to whom also this institution is greatly indebted are retired Surgeon-General James Shaw, unquestionably the most popular Surgeon and Physician of his time; retired Surgeon-General George Smith, whose energies were devoted to the advancement of Medical education; Dr. William Evans, the sound and thoughtful Physician and teacher; Mr. J. E. Mayer, a zealous teacher of Chemistry Dr. J. Liston Paul, the skilful Surgeon and able teacher; Dr. H. W. Harris, the leading Gyn12 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL COLLEGEMADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. 13 Second Department. For Students qualifying for the Apothecary Grade. First Year. Second Year. Third Year.

SIR, I have the honor to submit the report on the Madras Medical College for Session 1885-86 with original statements, and a copy of my review thereon. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, D. DUNCAN, Director of Public Instruction.
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE, SESSION 1885-86. THE 51st Session of the Medical College closes this day. The following changes occurred in the College Staff during the year under review:6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Grouped according to the preliminary educational tests passed by the students, we have M.A. 4 B.A. 5 F.A., including one female 26 Matrics. (male and female) 175 Non-matrics. (lady students,Chemists and Druggists, &c.) 16 Total 226 Of the fourteen females included in the above number, one is an F.A., four are matriculates and nine non-matriculates. It may be noted that the college is now attracting candidates from outside the limits of this presidency, for we have on our lists. several students, male and female, who have come here from Bengal and Bombay. In the course of the session, two students, Messrs. Karney and Cox, proceeded to Europe to further prosecute their studies there; eight ceased to attend from illness and other causes, and two died, leaving at the close of the session 214 on the college rolls. In July last 116 candidates presented themselves for the several University examinations. The results were as follow:MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. 7 First L.M. and S. 78 Second do. 34 Preliminary Scientific 15 First M.B. and C.M. 3 Second do. 2 Total 132 During the past five years the numbers were as given below:8 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE going tuition in this department is steadily diminishing. In two years hence the Second department, from which Apothecaries were hitherto recruited, will be extinct, as, by G.O., No. 1966, dated 25th August 1884, it has been ruled that the system of gratuitous education, which has been in force in this department since the opening of this institution in 1835, be given up.

From a letter which is appended to this report, it will be seen what valuable services she is rendering to the women of Meywar. She writes:10 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE case, be raised. I would also recommend their attending a preliminary course of Materia Medica. The students of the M.B. class should also, in my opinion, attend a preliminary course." With reference to the above remarks, the College Council met on the 28th instant, and agreed to the following resolution:MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. 11 displayed much interest in the exercises. Lawn-tennis, cricket, and boating also had a fair share of attention. In the early part of the session, a Volunteer company of medical students was organized and, after undergoing the necessary amount of instruction in drill and rifle practice, it was incorporated with the Madras Volunteer Guards and now constitutes No. 7, or Medical College, company.

MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. 19 Statement in detail showing the Expenses of the Madras Medical College for the official year 188520 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Owing partly to Surgeon-Major Sibthorpe and Surgeon Dymott having accom- panied the Expeditionary Field Force to Burma, the changes in the College Staff were unusually numerous. 2. At the opening of the session there were 226 students against 215 in the previous year. The increase is all the more gratifying in that it appertained to every branch of the institution. It is also noteworthy that every class of the community was represented. With the exception of nine female students and those in the Chemist and Druggist class, all had passed some University examination. This augurs well for the future prosperity of the college. One female student had passed the F.A. examination, while four were matriculates. A very strong proof of the high esteem in which the college is held is that several students, male and female, have joined it from Bengal and Bombay. 3. Two students proceeded to Europe to prosecute their studies. It is matter for regret that from death, illness and other causes the number fell to 214 by the close of the session. 4. Out of the 116 students who went up to the University examinations, 71, or a percentage of 61.2, passed. 5. There having been a failure of 24 out of 84 in Anatomy in July 1885, the very proper step was taken of giving increased attention and time to that subject. 6. The Acting Director regrets to observe that several of the Professors have had occasion to report unfavorably of some of the Senior department students, their deficiencies being mainly ascribed to lack of industry. The Professors of Medicine and Hygiene express dissatisfaction with the L.M.S. students. Sixty per cent. are included by the Professor of Physiology and Ophthalmology under the two heads of "deficient" and "specially deficient" in Physiology and 57 per cent. in Ophthalmology. The Professor of Midwifery reports that the Senior department was, generally speaking, less industrious than the Second department. Complaint is made by the Professor of Materia Medica of the want of industry and intelligence of both the M.B. and C.M. students and the L.M.S. students. It is to be hoped that the senior students will in future do all in their power to maintain the high character of the institution. 7. The number of candidates going up for examination with a view to medical degrees has steadily increased, having risen from 31 in the year 1881 to 132 in 1886. The strength of the Senior or University department too shows considerable increase, having been 82 in 1881-82 and 134 in 1885-86. 8. The success of the three young men who took the M.A. degree in Biology is very creditable. 9. It is hoped that the example of the Tinnevelly Brahmin landlord, referred to by the Principal, will have many imitators. 10. The concession granted by the Scottish Branch of the Medical Council, Edinburgh, is a valuable one, and "may," as the Principal observes, "be accepted as proof of the growing estimation in which the college is held." 11. The reservation of the Warrant Medical Branch for Medical graduates is a salutary measure and is sure to increase the popularity of the college. 12. The Principal's hope that there will be no lack of employment for the passed students will certainly be realized, it being undeniable that as the country advances in intelligence, western medical skill will be more and more sought after. 13. The success of three former students in England, who have obtained commissions, is alike creditable to them and to their place of education. 14. There were seventy-one male and five female students in the Second department, which, the Principal points out, will cease to exist two years hence. This is not to be regretted, as the system of gratuitous education will cease with it and as a higher qualified body of medical students will fill the positions hitherto held by those passing out of the department. 15. The results of the Primary and Final examinations were highly satisfactory. 16. There was one failure out of four examined for the Druggist diploma.
21 MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. 17. The Acting Director is glad to find that the reports of the Professors on the Second department students are on the whole favorable. 18. The portion of the report which refers to the lady-students is very satis- factory. The number has risen from 7 to 14. They are applying themselves earnestly and successfully to their studies; and some of them are seeking Univer- sity distinctions. Female medical education may now be considered well-established in Madras, and there is not the slightest reason to doubt that with time the institution will be able to contribute largely to the supply of well-qualified medical women to the country. The growing desire among women for a sound medical education is not to be wondered at, the history of those who passed out in former years, as given in the report, being a narrative of remarkable success in life. The Acting Director cordially endorses the Principal's confident hope " that the day is not far distant when the inhabitants of every district and town of Southern India will enjoy the benefit of having in their midst a well-trained lady-doctor from this or some other Indian college." 19. The resolution of the College Council regarding the Chemist and Druggist class is receiving consideration. 20. It is noted that the new dissecting house, which is a great improvement on the sheds which were accidentally burnt down, is in full use. The tiffin-rooms and the additions to the college building, it is hoped, will be put in hand before long. 21. The thanks of the department are due to Mr. P. S. Ramasawmy Mudaliar, C.I.E., for the gold medal provided by him in commemoration of the Marquis of Ripon's visit to Madras in 1884. 22. The Acting Director sympathizes with the Principal in his remarks on the comparative dearth of permanent scholarships in the institution and he also would view with much satisfaction the establishment of a few research scholar- ships, it being in this direction that medical science in India has been weakest. The attention of the public should be called to the provisions of Chapter XII of the new Grant-in-aid Code, according to which Government will supplement endowments by a grant of half the amount given by the donor. 23. The gymnasium seems to be in a satisfactory condition. The formation of a Volunteer company is highly creditable to the students. With sympathetic and judicious encouragement, the Students' Association should prove of great value. 24. The Acting Director is glad to hear of the transfer of the portraits referred to by the principal. 25. The library and the museum appear to be in a satisfactory condition. 26. The aggregate expenditure was Rs. 67,496-2-0 and the receipts rose by Rs. 2,199. The Acting Director is glad to note that when stipends cease to be paid in the Second department there will be an annual saving of Rs. 14,000. 27. There has been a remarkable and most satisfactory increase in fees. In 1881-82 they were Rs. 8,744; in 1885-86 Rs. 17,104. 28. The Acting Director notes with satisfaction the tribute paid by the Prin- cipal to his colleagues and assistants. On the whole the report bears further testimony to the excellent work done by Dr. Keess and the staff of the college. (Signed) D. DUNCAN, Ag. Director of Public Instruction.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE, SESSION 1886-87. THE fifty-second academical year of this College opened on the 1st October 1886 with 211 students on the books, and four were admitted at the beginning of the summer session; forty-one were new admissions. The corresponding numbers at the beginning of the previous year were 226 and 46. The changes in the staff during the year were as follows:6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Surgeon-Major McNally, Professor of Chemistry, having been suddenly taken ill, was permitted to proceed on leave (M.C.) to Europe for one year (G.O., No. 213, dated 27th May 1887). Dr. Allison was appointed to take charge of his duties as a temporary measure, which he did on 17th May 1887.

MADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. 17 Statement in detail showing the Expenses of the Madras Medical College for the official year 188618 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE The academical year, being the fifty-second in the history of the institution, opened on the 1st October 1886 with 211 students on the rolls, and 4 more joined at the beginning of the summer session. The fresh admissions were 41. The corres- ponding numbers at the beginning of the previous year were 226 and 46, thus showing a diminution. 2. The changes in the staff were numerous, which necessarily interfered with the instruction. 3. On the retirement of Dr. Keess after a twenty years' connection with the institution, Brigade-Surgeon Porter was appointed Principal and took charge on the 3rd January. Mrs. Scharlieb having been compelled by ill-health to leave for Europe, Miss Bourchier, M.D., was appointed Lecturer on Midwifery and Diseases of Women and Children to the female students. Mr. Edgar Thurston, Superintendent of the Government Central Museum, was appointed Lecturer on Comparative Anatomy. 4. The 215 students were thus classifiedMADRAS MEDICAL COLLEGE. 19 Subjects. 1882-83. 1883-84. 1884-85. 1885-86 1886-87. 1887-88. First L.M.S. Examination.

In the Second L.M.S. examination a large proportion of failure was in Surgery and Oph- thalmology and Operative Surgery. Changes in the staff have probably contributed partly to the failure, but the Director is inclined to think that insufficiency in prac- tical instruction must have mainly contributed to the unsatisfactory results in the above subjects. The Principal is requested to submit his opinion on this point. If the time allotted to instruction in these subjects be insufficient, the time-table must be revised. The Director will also be glad to learn the views of the College Council. In the Preliminary Scientific examination of 1887, there were eight failures in Chemistry and one failure in Chemistry and Botany out of twelve candidates; and of the four pupils who failed in the First M.B. and C.M. examination, three failed in Comparative Anatomy. The Director observes that bye-law 211 of the University requires the passing of the Preliminary Scientific examination before the commencement of the regular medical studies. This rule appears to have been ignored. The examination consists of Chemistry, Chemical Physics and Botany, and there appears no sufficient reason why instruction in these subjects should not be obtained in the ordinary first-grade colleges where they are taught and the Medical College altogether relieved of the duty of giving instruction therein, a certificate of the Institution that a candidate has passed the examination being simply demanded for admission to the college in the senior department. The Principal is requested, after consulting the College Council, to report fully on the question. 12. The Director is pleased to hear of Mr. Karney's success in gaining a com- mission in the Indian Medical Service, and he congratulates Assistant Surgeon Eyles on the success which his work on "Malarial fever on the Gold Coast" has met with, in being favorably reviewed by the Lancet. 13.
