Several of the fairs are essentially dealers', e.g., Sonepur and Barapur, and I question whether the breeder will ever get a look in at them or if he will be induced to go to them at all. They are both old established and dealing is entirely the order of the day. 21. A European obtained the silver medal for the second time running at Sonepur for a Taylor-bred bull. IV.ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BENGAL VETERINARY COLLEGE For the year 1904-1905. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] I.-VETERINARY INSTRUCTIONS. THE STUDENTS. 1. Class A.( 6 ) THE INFIRMARY. 8. The total number of cases treated at the College Hospital during the year under report was 2,982 against 2,819 of last year, showing an increase of 163, which was due to the increased popularity of the infirmary and the people in the neighbourhood being more interested and more confident in the nature of the treatment received. Of these 2,982 cases 1,405 were in-patients and 1,577 out-patients. 9. A very lamentable falling off is, however, noticed in the number of cruelty cases sent here which was 83 against 278 of last year, although the attention of the Magistrate was drawn to the fact that cruelty could be more effectually prevented if, instead of fining the owners and allowing them to continue to work their animals, Magistrates were to send the animals to the hospital for treatment. If they could be persuaded to do this, it should tend to show the owners that we can frequently relieve their animals from their various forms of disease, and that we are always anxious to assist them both, ( 7 ) TABLE I Showing the main results of the Bengal Veterinary College during the year 1904-1905.

The Superintendent explains that this is due to the fact that in one dispensary last year each visit of an out-patient was reckoned as that of a new patient, and the error has now been corrected. Of the dispensaries established during the previous year, the Dinajpur Dispensary has had no in-patients owing to the difficulty in acquiring land for the necessary buildings, but it has done good work amongst out-patients. The Noakhali Dispensary had unfortunately to be closed owing to the impossibility of securing the services of a qualified Veterinary Assistant ; and in Purnea, owing to the fact that its dispensary was placed on a bad site, which will be changed, little or nothing was done. The difficulty experienced at Noakhali the Lieutenant-Governor hopes to overcome by the scheme which is now under contemplation for the complete reorganization of the Veterinary Department including the creation of a graded service. The scheme cannot be brought into force at once ; but with the rapid extension of the Bengal Veteri- nary College, and with the improved prospects which will be opened out to officers of the Department, His Honour is confident that in future there will not be the present difficulty in meeting the demands of the various districts for Veterinary Assistants, and that ultimately every subdivision in Bengal will have its own itinerant as well as stationary Veterinary Assistant. The difficulties encountered at Dinajpur and Purnea foreshadow others that may be met with in the development of the Department. To cope with them, His Honour looks to the District Boards and Municipalities for their loyal support in the matter of the improvement, construction, and extension of Dispensary buildings. Sir Andrew Fraser has noted with pleasure the action taken in this respect by the Gaya and Ranchi District Boards. The thanks of Government are due to the Committees who have supervised the management of the different dispensaries during the year. 6.
