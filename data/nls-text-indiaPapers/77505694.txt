No. 7462-GENERAL. FROM THE HON'BLE COLONEL R. C. MACWATT, C.I.E., M.B., F.R.C.S., I.M.S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab. TO THE HON'BLE MR. O. F. LUMSDEN, I.C.S., Financial Secretary to Government, Punjab. Dated Lahore, the 29th November 1918. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward, herewith, the annual report of the Chief Malaria Medical Officer, Punjab, for 1917. 2. The monsoon reached the Punjab on the 2nd June much in ad- vance of the normal time; rainfall was excessive throughout the Province, and continued up to the last week of October. The total rainfall for the year was 1693 " above the normal. The result was, as in other parts of India, and in years of excessive and late rainfall, a universal and virulent epidemic of mala- ria, most marked in the West and South-West districts of the Punjab and in Gurgaon, where flooding of the country occurred. 3. Although the rainfall in Amritsar City was less in 1917 than in 1914 and 1916 the number of mosquitoes in 1917 was much greater, and the prevalence of malaria much more marked. 4. It would appear that the number of deaths from " fevers " has pro- gressively increased during the past four years in certain districts coincidently with the introduction of canal irrigation. 5. The increase of Infant Mortality is attributable in part to malaria, but also in no small measure to inanition from the stoppage of secretion of milk in malaria-stricken mothers, and from contamination of cows' milk which, in such cases, had to be substituted for the natural supply. 6. The response by Civil Surgeons to the request for special reports on the increased incidence of malaria in their districts has been disappointing; their attention is again being drawn to the matter. 7. The results of quininisation of school children has not been convinc- ing; possibly due to the half-hearted way in which it is said to have been carried out. The subject is still controversial; and experiments on a large scale are being conducted in the Army in India, which, it is hoped, may help in settling the question of prophylaxis of malaria. 8. The delay in the submission of the report is regretted. It reached this Office on the 19th November from the Press. The initial delay occurred in the Chief Malaria Medical Officer's Office and there was further delay in having the maps and charts zincographed at Roorkee.

?REPORT ON MALARIA IN THE PUNJAB DURING THE YEAR 1917. I.-Introduction. The death-rate from Malaria in the Punjab is always a large one, but from time to time it reaches a very high figure, as in the year 1908 and in the year under review. There were 697,058 fever deaths in the year 1908, out of a total number of 1,020,125. In 1917 the number of fever deaths was 510,812 and the total number 733, 109. 2.    Though all the deaths reported as from fevers were not  necessarily due  to  malaria, it is probable that  these figures represent more  truly the immensity of the mortality caused directly or indirectly by this infection  than for instance to those referable to plague. 3.    The indirect effect of malaria  on the  mortality  rate  is  probably more  to be  feared  than the direct.    It would be difficult to give any idea of its malign influence on the causation of deaths in  infancy and  on  those due ostensibly to  respiratory diseases.    It  certainly  has a  serious  effect  on the birth-rate and on the expectation of life, while it is the greatest of all the causes for disability and inefficiency in the adult. II.-GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 4.    The total number of deaths from fever was 510,812  against 376,003 in  1916  and    284,784 in   1915  giving   a  death-rate  respectively of   26.42, 19.44 and 14.72. 5.   The number of autumnal fever deaths for the year 1917 was 190,235, while for the years 1915  and 1916  it  was 45,685 and 92,936, giving a mor- tality rate of 9.83, 2.36 and 4.80, respectively. 6.    There were 91,505 more deaths in 1917 than in any one of the   last 17 years excepting in the great epidemic of 1908. 7.    The total number of deaths  from  "Fevers "   was   510,812,  while from all causes this amounted  to 733,109, the corresponding death-rates being 26.42 and 37.91,  respectively ;  thus  "Fevers"   were responsible  for  more than 5/7th of the total deaths in the Province.

?8. The annual mortality from fevers shown in Chart 1 of Appendix A shows a conspicuous rise in 1917 as compared with 1916. The total mortality with its relation to the fever mortality and the autumnal exacerbation are demonstrated in Chart 2 of the same Appendix. The autumnal fever deaths of 1917 were more than double the number that occurred in the same period of the previous year, in which the incidence of fever was fairly high, while they were four times more than in 1915. III.-METEOROLOGICAL FEATURES OF THE PUNJAB FOR 1917. 9. During the first two months the rainfall was either wanting altogether or much below normal ; the month of March was relatively drier and the fall defective though the precipitation exceeded that of the months of January and February. The rainfall in April was, though late, abnormally high. The month of May was noticeable for a number of dust-storms and thunder-storms and the rainfall was much above the average. The monsoon broke as early as the 2nd June and spread to the whole of the Province ; and there were general rains on the 2nd ,3rd, 7th, 17th to 20th and 29th of June and the total monthly rainfall was 1.15" above the average. The precipitation in July was about the normal in the south-west, but was more marked in the north and east. The rainfall was far in excess generally during the months of August and September, the total for the whole of the province being in excess of the normal by 4" or 75 per cent. in the former months, and 8 1/4" or 306 per cent. in the latter. During the first week of October there were numerous showers in the north and east of the Province and again from the 24th to the 26th of the month, amounting for the month to 3.03 " which was 2.82 " above the average. The month of November was unusually rainless. In December winter rain was of frequent occurrence and depressions were more marked than usual in the north and east. The total annual rainfall was very heavy, being as much as 16.93 " in excess of the normal. The humidity of the atmosphere was low in February and March, it bord ered on the average in January and July, but was high in the months in which malaria was present in epidemic form. The maximum temperature in the month of February was above the normal by 51/2 , but was lower than usual by 3 or more from April to June and again from August to November. The minimum temperature remained prac- tically about the normal but for the months of April, May and November, when it was about 4 below the average. 10. Thus it appears that the monsoon was unusually heavy, with ex- cessive, but not a continuous rainfall, and that the humidity was distinctly high during the autumnal months of the year. These factors provided clima- tic conditions favourable to the prevalence of malaria in an epidemic form. It was the heavy rainfall late in October more marked in the eastern districts, which probably minimized the severity of the epidemic of malaria in this part of the Province ; in the district of Gurgaon, however, it had the contrary effect as it caused flooding of the country : while being so much further south there was little relative reduction of temperature. In the eastern districts too there was no general flooding from the Rivers ; so except in some localities where drainage was inefficient, as in the Amritsar District, the water flowed off ra- pidly taking with it no doubt innumerable quantities of anopheline larvae. To the west and south-west this late fall of rain had much the same effect as in Gurgaon--it caused local flooding which lasted for a long time, but it was not sufficient to cause any marked fall in the temperature with the result that there was a late and very severe epidemic of malaria. IV.--DISTRIBUTION OF ENDEMIC MALARIA. 11. The epidemic through which the Province has passed, though not as great in its effects as in the last previous general epidemic in 1908 when there were 697,058 deaths from " fevers " and a mortality rate of 34.66, was yet sufficiently severe and only the districts of Simla, Kangra and Rawalpindi escaped.
3 12 The number of deaths from "fevers" amounted to 510,812 and the death-rate was 26.42 per mille of population as compared with 376,003 deaths and a mortality rate of 19.44 per mille in 1916 and a quinquennial mean of 16 68. 13. The distribution of the fever mortality by months is given in table I of Appendix B, as also the total mortality, in order to compare them with the fever death-rate of the previous year, and the mean ratio per mille of popu- lation for the previous five years. The numbers of still births and infantile deaths with the ratio for the year are also shown. 14.    The largest number of deaths as was the case in the previous   year was recorded in the months of November, October   and December ; the   num- ber of deaths was respectively 104,555, 85,680 and 73,098 against 47,820, 45,116 and 40,529 in like order in these months in  1916;  but  in   1908   the greatest number occurred in October, November came next and then   December when the figures in this order were respectively 169,155, 138,161 and 83,364. 15.    The   highest   fever   mortality was   recorded   in  the  districts  of Muzaffargarh with 43.48, Multan 41.52, Gujranwala 41.36, Dera Ghazi  Khan 40.85, Montgomery 40.63, Mianwali  36.81, Shahpur 32.68, Jhang 31.68, Gur- gaon 31.51, Sialkot 28.23 and Amritsar 27.83. A reference to the fever mortality records of the previous year shows that the district fever death-rate was 29.79 in Muzaffargarh, 22.59 in Multan, 30.87 in Gujranwala, 21.99 in Dera Ghazi Khan, 18.49 in Montgomery, 32.82 in Mianwali, 17.32 in Shahpur, 16.08 in Jhang, 12.94 in Gurgaon, 20.89 in Sialkot and 19.62 in Amritsar ; and the districts with highest fever mortality were Mianwali with 32.82 per mille, Gujranwala 30.87, Muzaffargarh 29.79, Multan 22.59, Kangra 22.40, Dera Ghazi Khan 21.99, Rawalpindi 21.18, Attock 20.99, Sialkot 20.89 and Hissar 20.06. The districts with the lowest fever mortality rate per mille were Simla with 11.52, Kangra with 17.74, Jullundur with 18.02 and Rawalpindi with 18.40. These rates were, with the exception of that of Kangra where it was very slightly below, higher than the quinquennial average. The fever mortality rate in these districts in 1916 was 9.23 in Simla, 22.40 in Kangra, 15.95 in Jullundur and 21.18 in Rawalpindi ; but the dis- tricts with the lowest mortality rate in that year were Simla with 9.23, Gur- gaon 12.94, Rohtak 14.24 and Lyallpur 14.90. 16.    If a comparison of the  fever  mortality  rate  of the year be made with the rates of the  previous year and last quinquennium (vide Table  I of Appendix B) it will be  seen  that  the fever death-rate has stood persistently high in the provincial districts ; as shown below :- Table II. Showing the districts with consistent high fever mortality. No.                                                           Name of district. RATIO OF FEVER  DEAHTS PER MILLE.

?17. The three largest towns in the Punjab, Multan, Amritsar and Lahore recorded fever death-rates of 30.46, 29.95 and 25.89 against 15.78, 13.57 and 21.13 in the previous year. The figures for the years 1908, 1909, 1916 and 1917 of these towns are given in the following table :- Table III.

From this it will be   seen that at Multan  the death-rate  was con- siderably higher than it was in 1908, and that, though the towns of Lahore and Amritsar  also  suffered   badly, the  severity of  the epidemic  at Amritsar,   as judged by the motality, was not more than  about half of what it was in that year. 19.    The epidemic figure for  Amritsar was   13.3 in the year 1908,10.7 in 1887 and 9.8 in the  year under review, much higher than the figure for the intervening years.    It is,  however,  necessary, to  obtain a proper  estimate of the unhealthiness of Amritsar, to take the total  mortality  rate into considera- tion when   comparing  the  intensity of the epidemics of these two years or of previous   epidemics as it has been found that for the last three years, for some reasons not yet explained, the respiratory death-rate has risen in such a way as to make it seem very  likely that  the " fever  rate " for  1917  has been much understated. 20.     Table II   of Appendix B   shows that in the smaller towns a fever death-rate  as high as 95.03 was  recorded in  Rajanpur, 78.41 in Kot  Mithan, 70.51 in Dajal, 63.65 in Firozpur-Jhirka,   60.91 in   Khangarh,  54.52 in Karor, 50.43 in Pakpattan, 50.21 in  Shujabad,   49.36 in Begowala   45.67 in Chubar- kana,  44.19   in  Kamalia,    Hafizabad   43.89, Sahiwal  43.09,  Sodhra  43.08, Baghbanpura 43.04 and Kila Didar Singh 40.27.    In the previous year the rate was highest in Begowala 54.41, Karor 48.82,  Kila Didar Singh 44.34, Bhakkar 36.01, Miani 28.01, Khangarh  27.17,  Leiah  25.45, Pind Dadan Khan 25.40, Gujranwala 25.39, Wazirabad 25.31, Ramnagar 24.16 and Sodhra 24.00. The towns affected to a markedly less extent by the effect of fever, as shown by the fever mortality rate in Table II of Appendix B were Rewari with 1.69, Dalhousie with 3.20, Kangra 3.59, Sargodha 5.31, Muktsar 6.34, Dharmkot 6.49, Nankana 6.85, Mitranwali 6.91, Fatehabad (Hissar) 7.07, Gojra 7.20, Murree 7.35 and Banga 7.39. In the previous year the lowest rates were 0.69 for Rewari, 2.03 for Gojra, 3.05 for Sargodha, 6.24 for Shahabad, 6.32 for Dharmkot, 6.57 for Tarn Taran, 6.91 for Mitranwali, 6.97 for Hafiz- bad and 7.10 for Akalgarh. 21. The urban and rural death-rates from fever were 21.46 and 26.91, respectively, against 14.87 and 19.90 in the previous year ; they are much lower than those in 1908 in which year they were recorded as 22.53 and 34.90, respectively. 22. The provincial fever death-rate of 26.42 was exceeded in 11 dis- tricts and 35 towns ; but if the urban death-rate were considered separately, the number of towns would mount up to 58.

6 26.    In this chart it is noticeable that while the  rainfall in 1914 and 1916 was much in excess of that of 1917, the town of Amritsar only experienc- ed an epidemic in the latter year.    On the other hand, the fever  death-rate of Multan city was 30.46 per mille, which was much higher than even that in the epidemic year of 1908 when it was 23.80, while the  rainfall in the year under review in Multan city amounted  to 19.83" against 6.25" in  1916 and 9.53" in 1908.   In the previous 20 years (since records have become available) Multan had never had such a heavy rainfall ; in the year 1897 it is true it had reached 12.55" but in that year the death-rate from fever was only 14.49. From the history of  these   two towns it would seem quite certain that though a heavy rainfall is essential to the production of an epidemic of malaria it is not the only factor as it may not necessarily be followed by one. 27.    Map I appended to  Appendix C, gives the annual fever  mortality rate per mille for the   28  districts of the province  for  the years 1916  and 1917  with a view  to  singling  out those in which the fever death-rate, having remained constantly high for some years,  may  be  held to  contain  endemic centres. Maps II and III are given in Appendix C to show the spleen census of different places (where there are dispensaries) preceding and following the fever season, i.e., at the end of the June and November respectively. From this chart some idea should be obtained as to the places which were visited by the epidemic and those that escaped it. 28.    The tables below show the names of the places at which the spleen rate remained high after a succession of mild malarial years   have been classed as endemic or hyper  endemic centres  in the  terms  of relative  intensity of malaria :- Table IV.

Sinanwan 75.8 86.1              From these tables it will appear that the spleen-rate is liable to fluc- tuation and that in spite of the malaria incidence being so high this year some places show a lower spleen-rate figure. Factors that have some bearing on these results are (1) the eastern half of the province escaped the epidemic and (2) the introduction of quininisation as a prophylactic into schools. 29. A high spleen-rate extending over a series of years presupposes endemic centres, and as they in turn are likely to be the seats of epidemics when other conditions are favourable it is necessary to keep them under close observation. 30. The spleen-rate has been steadily on the increase in Montgomery, and the parasite-rate has increased in both it and Mianwali since canal water was introduced. The following table has been introduced to show this and also the marked difference between the conditions existing in the civil station of Mianwali and the town to which irrigation has not been extended.

The results of an examination made of the children in the vil- lages and the civil station on the New Namal Canal as well as those of Mian- wali Town and Kundian which are not so irrigated, are given below to show that in the former places (1) the spleen-rate in children is markedly higher, (2) the infection index is fairly high and (3) the spleen-rate and parasite-rate in the children on quinine parade have not been appreciably affected.

It will be noticed that in most of the towns the increase in fever mortality-rate is uniform; but there are a few places where the rise is sudden and corresponds with the year of introduction of canal irrigation, after which the mortality remains high. V.-EPIDEMIC MALARIA. Notes on Multan, Sialkot and   Amrit-sar towns 36.    The towns of Multan and Sialkot were badly affected as shown by  the   fever   mortality rates for the   months  of  August, September and  August,    September  and  October, which  were 16.20, 49.65 and 107.48 per mille at Multan  and 12.85, 37.34 and 53.36 per mille at Sialkot.    The respective   figures for 1908 for Multan  were  21.50,   20.17 and 50.71;  and for  Sialkot  7.86, 27.91   and 51.40.  Sialkot suffered heavily this year, much more than in the epidemic  of 1968 but not nearly  as much as in the  epidemics   of   1890,   1892   and 1900. Multan has never been visited by an epidemic of such severity.  There had been a considerable amount of cholera  at  Multan  and some in Sialkot, but it had ceased to have much effect on the death-rate in  September.    In  Amritsar the fever ratio which  was  17.65  in  August  reached    3.82  in   September  and 108.89   per mille in October, while in 1908 the figures   for August, September and October  were respectively  25.89, 78.00  and 266.25, whereas the average for the previous five years was 41.84.    It will be noted that the epidemic was much less in severity than that of 1908, and still more so than that of 1892. A reference has already been made to the increased death-rate under the head of respiratory diseases at Amritsar, there was also a tendency, which too had its effects upon the fever death-rate, to ascribe the increased mortality to cholera. An examination of blood films in cases reported under both these heads by my first assistant of the Malarial Bureau, Bawa Harnam Singh Phalla, invariably discovered the presence of malaria parasites (Plasmodium Falciparum). A large proportion of the mortality at Amritsar occurred amongst infants, and as the lower classes (amongst whom the increase was most notice- able) give their children raw milk it is very probable that the bowel symp- toms that were in many cases the immediate cause of death were due to the -addition to it of impure water. 37. To gauge the extent of the intensity of malaria and in order to discover its increased incidence in towns during 1917, the following factors have been utilized:- (1)     Provincial epidemic figures. (2)     Increase of spleen-rate taken after the  fever  season  in Punjab towns  over  that taken in June 1917. (3)    Increased number of  fever  cases attending  dispensaries in the year  under review as compared with the figures  from   1908 upwards.  4) Comparison of the provincial fever-death-rate per mille from September to December inclusive for the 5 years ending 1916 with that of the districts of  the Punjab for the year 1917. (5)    Infantile mortality rate in 1917. 38.    (1)    The Epidemic figure.-The epidemic figure for the year 1917 has been found by dividing the fever mortality figures for  November by  the average number of fever deaths for the months of April, May, June and July- the months of   non-epidemic mortality.    The month of November was chosen as the  virulence of malaria was highest  in that month as shown by   the pro- vincial  fever mortality figures. 39.    The epidemic figure was above 5 in many of the  towns and   rural areas showing that (1) an  epidemic  of malaria visited them and that (2) the autumnal recrudescence  was conspicuously high. 40.    The towns and  rural  areas, showing the  epidemic figure as 5 or over it, are given below in a tabular form

Map IV appended in the Appendix C. to show the  relative  in- tensity of malaria as it affected the whole of   Province.    The   epidemic  figure for the districts is shown in red while that of the towns is in blue. 43.     (2).  Comparison  of  spleen   census  figures for  1917.-From   comparative study of the spleen census maps II and III for 1917  appended  Appendix C. it will be seen that the incidence of malaria was most marked   in the vicinity of rivers, newly constructed canals and inundation canals.

(3)    Hospital returns of fever  cases.-The  records of fever cases attending the different hospitals and dispensaries of various towns are   given to show the marked increase in the incidence of malaria all over the province, and its relative prevalence in different  towns. It may be noticed that the list is much larger than that of the  previous year indicating widespread  epidemic conditions. 46.    The hospitals returns of fever cases show not only   the   severity of malaria in towns but also in the neighbourhood as the patients from neighbour-ing villages go to seek medical aid at the nearest dispensary. 47.    It will be seen that the number of patients attending   most of  the canal dispensaries, newly opened to the public, and those in places  near rivers have very much increased ; in some places the severity of the epidemic  was so great that it was more intense than that of 1908 as at Mandi Dabwali Jhajjar, Nuh, Firozpur Jhirka, Hajipur, Khalra, Najabat, Bedian, Attari, Raya Canal, Dinanagar,   Pathankot,    Ramnagar,   Hafizabad,   Aligarh,    Shahkot,   Sangla, Sharakpur, Marh, Mohlan, Chuhar Kana, Phalia, Kunjah, Kadirabad, Sahiwal, Khushab, Naushehra,   Midh,  Bhalwal,   Kandiwala,   Mianwali,   Montgomery, Gojra, Pakpattan, Satghara, Chichawatni, Toba Tek Singh, Dijkot, Santokhgarh, Kot Isa Shah, Atharan Hazari, Wer, Varyam, Multan, Kahror, Mailsi,  Kabir-wala, Jalalpur, Muzaffargarh, Sananwan, Karor and Dajal.

The districts of Multan, Muzaffargarh, Dera Ghazi Khan, Shahpur and Gujranwala suffered much, especially the newly irrigated areas. A reference to the severe epidemic in the Shahpur Irrigation Division is made in the Drainage Report of the Lower Jhelum Circle for the monsoon of 1917. 49. (4) Comparison of the provincial fever death-rate per mille for the last quarter of the year for the last quinquennium ending in 1916 with the same figure for different districts of the Punjab for 1917 and 1908.-The following table shows the fever death-rate per mille from September to December of 1917 and 1908 in different districts of the Punjab :- Table XV.

23 50.   The provincial figures for the years from 1909 to 1916 were 23.43, 18.38, 12.81, 15.56, 20.77, 21.53, 11.78 and 25.89. 51 It will be noticed that Rohtak, Karnal, Ambala, Simla, Kangra, Jullundur, Ludhiana and Rawalpindi escaped the epidemic, and that while the districts of Gurgaon, Amritsar, Sialkot Gujranwala, Shahpur, Mianwali, Montgomery, Jhang, Multan, Muzaffargarh and Dera Ghazi Khan suffered badly, the districts of Gujranwala, Mianwali, Montgomery, Jhang, Multan, Muzaffargarh and Dera Ghazi Khan were visited by an epidemic more severe than that of year 1908. It is worthy of remark that the first four of the districts in the latter category are newly irrigated, while the last 3 are served by inundation canals or are liable to be visited by floods connected with the Indus or the Chenab. Taken as a whole there is no doubt but that the severity of the epidemic was most marked in the western and south-western parts of the province. VI.-INFANTILE MORTALITY. 52.    The infantile mortality ratio for the whole of the Province for  the year under review was 207.94 per mille.    This was exceeded in  11  districts- Muzaffargarh with 383.33, Dera  Ghazi Khan  350.29,   Multan   345.62,  Simla 340.60, Gujranwala 336.52, Jhang 319.43, Shahpur 301.52, Montgomery 296.70, Mianwali  291.01, Amritsar 266.81 and Sialkot 251.29.    In all these districts with the exception of  Simla malaria prevailed in a virulent form. The high infantile mortality of Simla, though partly attributable to the ignorance of the people was probably mainly due to overcrowding and as a result there was a greater incidence of infectious diseases, as whooping cough and measles, with a consequent tendency to suffer from respiratory diseases. 53.    The infantile mortality rate exceeded 300 per mille in the following towns  of the Punjab:-Kot Mithan 692.8, Rajanpur 678.3, Killa Didar Singh 686.2,   Alipur   602.4,   Khangarh    59.2,   Shahpur    554.2,    Shujabad    545.7, Pakpattan   533.5,  Sambrial  477.2,   Karor 468.3,  Ramnagar  446.2,  Sahiwal 422.2,   Shahkot  416.6,   Khangarh   407.2,   Jagadhri   398.9,   Khushab  387.0, Baghbanpura  384.0,  Multan 382.4,   Pindi Bhattian 380.0,    Firozpur-Jhirka 375.7, Begowala  367.9,   Zaffarwal  366.9, Montgomery   364.1,   Simla  363.1, Pathankot 554.7, Jhang 352.3, Dalhousie and Fazilka 350.0, Wazirabad 342.0,  Muzaffargarh   341.7,  Leiah   340.2, Sirsa 339.2,  Dinanagar   333.3, Kamalia 331.7,   Buriya  331.2,  Jampur  330.1,  Hafizabad   322.4, Gujranwala   319.4, Fatehabad  318.1,  Isa Khel 317.3, Mianwali 315.1, Daud and Faridabad 308.0, Chunian 307.0, Pind Dadan Khan 306.4 and Lahore 300.0. 54.    This roughly coincides with the greater intensity of malaria so that, except in a few instances, such as at  Simla, Dalhousie and Jagadhri,  the exces- sive mortality rate coincides more or less closely with that due to malaria. VII.-REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE PUNJAB MALARIA BUREAU. 55. The research work of the Bureau was greatly handicapped as one of the Assistant Surgeons obtained a temporary commission in the Indian Medical Service, and one was only a part time worker and then only up to the middle of year. Thus one member of the staff with the assistance of two Sub-Assistant Surgeons practically carried out the whole of the work. In spite however of these difficulties observations were conducted in regard to the prevalence of malaria in a large number of towns and villages. 56.    The malaria surveys of Gohana and Khangarh which  had  been commenced last year were completed.    Short notes on these will be submitted as soon as the results can be worked out.    A detailed report on the survey of Thanesar was completed. 57.    A detailed report on malaria in Amritsar with special recommenda- tions by  Major  C.  A.   Gill,  I.M.S., the late   Chief Malaria Medical Officer, Punjab, was submitted to Government.    This is a valuable record,  and  it has added much to our knowledge of malaria in the Province.
?24 58. Surveys of Sananwan and Kot Adu were taken up early in the year, and one of Karor late in the year at the suggestion of the Local Govern- ment as made in the review of the last year's annual report.  The country round Sananwan is usually found to be submerged during the rains on account of soma and though a drain has been cut from Sananwan to Gurmani, through which the water was rapidly flowing at the time of inspection, no impression appeared to be made on the flooded area.  A large number of larv was breeding in the flood waters, especially in the rice fields.  The survey of the town of Kot Adu was taken up for the sake of comparison, as it was considered to be the healthier of the two places from the point of view of malaria, and as on this ground the tahsil headquarters were to be transferred to it. Observations have shown that Kot Adu does not seem to fulfil anticipations but rather that it is more malarious than Sananwan.  Karor was suggested for survey by the Local Government as the fever death-rate there has been constantly high.  59. The characteristics of the anopheline fauna were observed in a great many towns and villages, and mosquitoes collected from different parts of the Province. They were examined, classified and a few specimens preserv- ed for identification.  60. Thousands of anopheles were dissected to determine the local carrier species in the various places, and again efforts were made to discover if the A. Rossi acts as a carrier of malaria in the Punjab, but these have hitherto ended in failure.  61. The towns of Amritsar, Mianwali, Montgomery and Sialkot were visited, and observations made during the last fever season.  62. Some villages in the Ambala District at the foot of the sub- Himalayan range were visited in an attempt to gauge the amount of malaria at the foot of the hills as compared with that in the hills and in the plains. It was found that there was a definite decrease in spleen rate as one proceeded from the foot of hills to the open plains.  63. The usual periodic spleen census of the province was carried out. Various statistics having a direct bearing of malaria have been collected from a large number of towns.  64. The spleen-rate, as taken by medical men in charge of Civil Hospi- tals last year, was checked at Dinga, Sargodha, Bhera and Sambrial and the result showed that much more trouble might be taken by them in carrying out this duty.  65. At Lahore anopheles larv were found to abound in the new storm water channel, which has been dug from the Ohangar Mohalla behind the Landa Bazar to the Budha River, and in the shallow water on the small lawns between the Hazuri Bagh gate and the Badshahi mosque; unfortunately when the Budha River is full the new channel, instead of emptying into it, receive s water from it in which as it stagnates anopheles larv develope in large numbers. These breeding places in the close vicinity of the fort area are a source of danger to the Fort and the northern part of the town.  66. The towns of Sialkot, Bahawalnagar, Samasata, Khanpur and Bahawalpur were visited with a view to gauging the extent of the outbreak of malaria reported. The hospital returns at the railway dispensaries at Samasata, Khanpur and Bahawalnagar showed a very large out-door attendance for fever pointing to a very marked increased incidence of malaria.  67. Correspondence has been kept up in connection with the work of reducing the number of breeding places in Lahore, Mianwali and certain other places.
?25 68. There has been no response made to our efforts to obtain special reports on the incidence of malaria from Civil Surgeons; very little interest seems to be taken in it, and as a matter of fact the diseases due to these infec- tions are taken too much as a matter of course. VIII.-ANTI-MALARIAL MEASURES. 69. The scheme of quininisation of school children which was tried with gratifying results in Amritsar in 1914 was extended to many other localities in the Punjab. It has unfortunately been carried out half heartedly in some places, so much so that, as remarked by the Headmaster of the Amritsar Government High School, the spleen rate increasd in November 1917, inspite of the administration of the prophylactic. In other places where schoolmasters were keen, the results were good with the result that parents were convinced of it, utility. Local authorities were again late in sending in their indents for Quinine Tablets and registers;- success can only be expected if the admin- istration of the drug is commenced early in the season and if schoolmasters take a lively interest in the scheme. 70. As on account of the excessive monsoon rains it became evident that the incidence of malaria would be very considerably above the usual, the attention of all Civil Surgeons and Deputy Commissioners was drawn to the possible occurrence of malaria in an epidemic form. They were- asked to co- operate in combating it by taking steps to-- (a) obtain a sufficient supply of quinine in advance and arrange for a free distribution. (b) deal with temporary and permanent breeding places of mosquitoes by draining and other measures indicated. The Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab, deputed Sub-Assistant Surgeons on malaria duty in the following districts: -- Hissar, Gurgaon, Karnal, Ambala, Jullundur, Ludhiana, Ferozepore, Lahore, Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Shahpur, Mianwali, Campbellpur, Montgomery, Jhang, Muzaffargarh, and Dera, Ghazi Khan. 71. My 1st Assistant Bawa Harnam Singh Bhalla was deputed for special malarial work to Amritsar and Dr. T. N. Sinha, Assistant Plague Medical Officer: for relief work. NOTE ON MEMBERS OF THE STAFF. 72. Assistant Surgeon Bawa Harnam Singh Bhalla has been of the utmost assistance to me. Always ready to undertake work of an emergent kind and ever willing to open up and embark on new lines of enquiry he is yet so persistent in his routine work that I feel it would be extremely difficult to find his equal in the particular kind of work he is doing. Assistant Surgeon Dhan Raj Bhasin worked for seven months and proved to be a useful assistant. Sub-Assistant Surgeons Abdul Ghaffar and Ghulam Mohy-ud-din worked efficiently throughout the year. Laboratory Assistants Daulat Ram and Abdul Razaq continued to do useful work. The work of the clerical establishment has been satisfactory. H.
