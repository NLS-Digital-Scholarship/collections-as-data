?51 III.-SUMMARY OF WORK CARRIED ON BY MR. HANKIN. Mr. Hankin has carried out a long series of researches on the action of dis- infectants on the microbe of bubonic  plague.    He finds  that it is somewhat resistant to the action of carbolic acid.    Both phenyle, lysol and izal appear to have a more energetic action.    Phenyle and lysol, however, were found not to exert a marked bactericidal action on a cowdung floor.    Naphthaline was found to have no  action on the plague microbe.    The plague microbe was found to be comparatively resistant to the action of alkalies, and especially sensitive to  the action of acids.    Even weak organic acids appear to  destroy it readily.    It is however usually able to exist for some hours in acid urine.    Milk, so soon as it has acquired an acid reaction, appears to have acquired the power of destroy- ing the microbe.    Inorganic acids are naturally still more active, and Mr. Han- kin thinks that sulphuric acid might  be used as a cheap  disinfectant against the plague infection.    The microbe was found to be  resistant to  the  action of reducing agents,  and sensitive to the  action  of oxidising agents, such as per- manganate of potash or chloride of lime.    A solution of one part of perman- ganate  of potash in 50,000 parts of water appears to be capable of destroying the plague microbe in five minutes under the conditions of Mr.   Hankin's ex- periments,  but this substance is not recommended as a disinfectant except in cases in which there may be reason for  thinking that water has been infected by the washing  of infected clothes, &c.    It was shown that the  activity of potassium permanganate in destroying microbes may be greatly increased by the addition of a small quantity of sulphuric acid, but the mixture is not recom- mended except under special  conditions.    Mr. Hankin discusses the bearing of his  observation of the  sensitiveness of the microbe to oxidising agents on the generally  advocated  plan of combating the infection by means  of ventilation, which, he shows, is probably a means of producing oxidation under the influence of air and light.    A  series  of observations  was made in houses undergoing disinfection.    Results were  obtained throwing doubt on the  utility of sulphur fumigation and whitewashing as a means of destroying the microbe.    Mr. Han- kin comes to the  conclusion that the  only substance capable  of satisfactorily disinfecting a cowdung floor is sublimate in an acid solution.     Sublimate in a neutral solution was found to be without action on the microbes present.    As an after-treatment and as a means of treating courtyards, passages and drains, Mr. Hankin recommends sulphuric acid in a strength of 1 in 250, which solution he  shows to be far cheaper than that of other disinfectants in common use.    It is likely that this will make the treated places for some time unfitted to act as a   nidus for the microbe, for the latter is shown to  be destroyed within 5 minutes by  a  solution  of the  strength of  1   in  1429.      Another method of disinfecting floors investigated by Mr. Hankin is by covering them with a layer of combustible material at least two inches thick, which is then set on fire.    It was shown that this treatment is far more efficacious than the use of ordinary dis- infectants.    Though it is pointed out the risk of fire may prevent the wide application of the method in towns, it may find application in the treatment of public latrines that may be supposed to be infected, and which are commonly built of incombustible materials. Mr. Hankin has also carried out a series of experiments on the asserted possibility of finding the bubonic microbe in the earth of infected houses. He has examined large numbers of specimens brought from places in which many people had recently succumbed to the infection without finding the microbe in any case, with one probable exception. The search has been carried out by several methods, including one communicated to him by Professor Calmette, which method appears to have been the one employed by Professor Yersin in Hong Kong, and which led him to positive results. In Mr. Hankin's hands no such results were obtained, thus throwing doubt on the statement that the microbe can be readily found in the soil of infected houses, at any rate by existing methods. The only case in which a microbe probably identical with that of plague was met with was in some salt water in a field near Siwri, at the time that the epidemic was present in the place. Some of this water was injected into a mouse. On its death a microbe was isolated from its organs, which resembled that of
52 plague in most respects, but which differed from it in the rapidity with which it formed involution forms on agaragar. Mr. Hankin found that the plague mic- robe could be changed into a microbe having these aberrant characters by culti- vation on agaragar containing three or four per cent. of salt, and that further the microbe from Siwri was pathogenic to a rabbit that had not been protected by Haffkine's plague vaccin, but had no effect on a rabbit that had been so pro- tected. Consequently it was supposed that this microbe was the plague microbe altered by its sojourn in salt water. This observation has led to the discovery of a rapid method of identifying the plague microbe by its cultivation on agar- agar containing a certain percentage of salt. It has been further worked out by Surgeon-Captains James and Thomson under Mr. Hankin's supervision. Mr. Hankin has investigated the relation of insects to the dissemination of the disease. He has found the microbe in bugs from the infectious Diseases Hospital. He has also found it in ants that had recently been eating rats dead of plague. A long series of experiments showed that ants do not retain the plague infection long, and further that no trace of infection is present in ants from localities in which rats have not been dying recently. Hence these insects cannot be regarded as important agents for the spread of the disease. Experiments were carried out on different kinds of grain and other articles of export. They were infected with plague microbes under many different conditions. At stated intervals extracts of specimens of the infected grain were prepared and injected into mice. By this means it was found that the infec- tion usually died out within 4 to 6 days. The possibility was indicated that it might in exceptional cases survive for so long as 13 days, but of this no definite proof was obtained. Mr. Hankin points out that grain, when it becomes rotten, usually acquires a well marked acid reaction, owing to the production of various fatty acids from the decomposition of carbohydrates. He has found that such fatty acids act as disinfectants for the bubonic microbe. Hence it is difficult to believe that the microbe can exist in rotten grain, as has been frequently assumed. The matter was put to an experimental test by Dr. Srinivasa Rao while working in Dr. Hankin's laboratory. It was found that the microbe always dies out in rotten grain within 2 to 24 hours. The microbe, though usually dying out, when placed in sterilised water, within three days, appears to be able to survive in sterilised cowdung for several days. The observation appears to have some bearing on the question of the persistence of the infection in houses having cowdung and mud floors. Through lack of time these experiments could not be continued sufficiently for any conclusion to be arrived at as to whether any particular kind of filth is more suitable than another to sustain the life of the microbe. But the general trend of Mr. Hankin's observations is to indicate that the chief source of infection is not likely to be in a saprophytic form of the microbe in the outside world, but more probably in the recently passed excreta of men or animals suffering from the disease.
