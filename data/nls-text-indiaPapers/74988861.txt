From the above Table and Return No. III, it will be seen that in the Presi- dency Circle, diseases of the digestive system furnish the chief admissions. The admission ratio for this class exceeds that of the previous year, but the death rate is almost identical. Dysentery, and hepatitis with or without abscess, have both been more prevalent. The death ratio for the former has been less, while that of the latter shows only a fractional increase over 1875. Venereal affections (syphilis and gonorrhMILITARY DEPARTMENT, 19TH SEPTEMBER 1877, No. 5279. 11 No fatal case occurred at Ramandroog. The admission rate for diseases of the digestive system has increased at depôts (taken collectively), but the death rate has decreased, there being but 3 deaths against 8 in the previous year, or a ratio of 4.62 against 10.81 per mille. Diseases of the circulatory system show an increased admission rate but a diminished death rate, there being but 1 death against 6 in previous year. The death was due to aneurism of the aorta, and occurred at Wellington. Troops on the March .12 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 19TH SEPTEMBER 1877, NO. 5279. TABLE H. Regiments. Average Strength. Admitted.

This man's child died of cholera four days previously. No cause for the attack in the latter is assigned. Two cases occurred at Bellary, viz., one in 43rd Regiment and one in the Royal Artillery; both recovered. In the former, which occurred in February, no satisfactory cause could be traced; in the latter, which occurred in July, the patient was in the habit of frequently visiting the Native town, where cholera was rife. Of the cases recorded at Bangalore, three occurred in the Royal Artillery and two in the 14th Hussars. One of the former and both of the latter proved fatal. Those in the Royal Artillery occurred in June. No cause could be traced. The two cases in 14th Hussars occurred on 1st and 24th February respectively. The first named was admitted in the morning for a small hMILITARY DEPARTMENT, 18TH SEPTEMBER 1878, NO 4838. 5 The chief outbreak of cholera during the year occurred at Thayetmyo, twenty- one cases and thirteen deaths being recorded at that station, viz., ten admissions6 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 18TH SEPTEMBER 1878, No. 4838 detained.

The sixth, due to measles, occurred at Bellary. Continued fevers, under which head are comprised ardent or heat fever, simple or non-specific continued fever and febricula were less prevalent than in 1876, the admission ratios being 130.72 and 135.29 respectively. The death ratio (0.09) was also less, there being but one death against four in 1876. It was due to simple continued fever, and occurred in an old soldier at Trichinopoly. Continued Fevers (simple continued ardent or heat fever, and febricula) have apparently increased in the Presidency and Mysore Circles, but decreased in those of Hyderabad and Burmah. In the Presidency, the increase is noted chiefly at Bellary, Trichinopoly and St. Thomas' Mount, while in the Mysore Circle it occurred chiefly at Bangalore. The decrease noted in the Hyderabad Circle occurred only at Kamptee, the admission rate at Secunderabad being identical with that of the previous year. Many of the cases returned as simple continued fever would be more appropriately recorded under the head of ardent or heat fever of the tropics, but the absence of such a heading from the established nomenclature of diseases forbids their being so designated. These cases were of a non-specific nature, and entirely due to endemic and climatorial influences. Paroxysmal Fevers (ague and remittent) show an increased admission rate as compared with 1876, the respective ratios being 70.26 and 55.60 per mille of strength. There was but one death. It was due to remittent fever, and occurred at Trichinopoly. This class shows an increase in the Presidency Circle as com- pared with 1876. They prevailed most at Bellary, which contributed 103 out of a total of 121 cases of ague in the Presidency Circle. A large number of the cases occurred during November and December, and were attributed to the heavy rain-fall in October. There has also been a slight increase in the Mysore Circle. Several of those recorded in the 14th Hussars, Bangalore, occurred in men who had exposed themselves when on a shooting excursion. The 45th Regiment, quartered at Bangalore, had not a single case. Remittent fever was absent from the Mysore Circle. In the Hyderabad Circle, the admission rate for paroxysmal fevers (129.27) exceeds that of 1876 by 26.41 per mille. There were 416 cases of ague and 8 of remittent fever. Of these, 232 cases of ague occurred at Secunderabad, 147 at Kamptee and 37 at Seetabuldee. Of the eight cases of remittent fever, six occurred at Secunderabad and two at Kamptee. Of the 232 cases of ague recorded at Secunderabad, 225 were furnished by the Infantry, the 44th Regiment contributing 190 cases; the 2/16th Regiment only arrived from England on 13th March 1876. The greater prevalence of the affection in this corps (44th Regiment) was due to its previous residence at Kamp- tee, where it had suffered much from malarial diseases. Surgeon-Major MacQueen, in his annual report of 44th Regiment for 1876, wrote as follows:9 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 18TH SEPTEMBER 1878, No. 4838. The Hyderabad Circle contributed the largest ratio of admissions, viz., 10.36 per mile. Mysore Circle comes next with a ratio of 5.09. The Presidency follows with a ratio of 1.87, the Burmah Circle contributing a ratio of 1.07 only. The death ratio in the Hyderabad and Mysore Circles was indentical, equalling 2.74 per mile; in the Presidency, 0.94; while in the Burmah Circle, there was no fatal case. The chief proportion of the cases in the Hyderabad Circle occurred at Secundera- bad, viz., thirty-three, and prevailed in the several corps in the following propor- tions, viz.:10 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 18TH SEPTEMBER 1878, No. 4838.

No. 7 Barrack-room is stated to have furnished the largest proportion of the cases, but nothing insanitary could be detected about the building although the flooring was lifted, and a careful investigation made, nor could anything insanitary be detected in any of the other buildings from which cases were admitted. The latrines are worked on the dry-earth system, the water reported good, and the drainage care- fully supervised. Macnamara filters are in use. None of the men are noted as intemperate. In fourteen out of the fifteen cases, the disease was not diagnosed on admission.

The case recorded in 33rd Regiment, Kamptee, occurred subsequent to com- mencing my published report, and is therefore omitted from it. From a perusal of the records submitted to me, I consider it to have been a case of continued non- specific fever rapidly becoming adynamic. This case is entered in the accompany- ing appendix.

Admissions from diseases of the circulatory system show a decrease, the ratio (15.89) being less by 1.09 per mille than in previous year. The death and invaliding rates are nearly identical with those of 1876. There were fourteen cases of aneurism against twelve in 1876. Nine deaths were due to this affection; three of the latter occurred out of hospital. A marked increase is noted in diseases of the absorbent system, the admission ratios for 1877 and 1876 being 38.49 and 21.11 respectively per mille of strength. It was caused chiefly by inflammation of the inguinal lymphatic glands, a great deal of which was due to venereal disease. Diseases of the digestive system still contribute the highest admission, death and invaliding rates in the Command. The admission and invaliding rates are slightly less, the death rate slightly higher than in 1876. Of fifty-nine deaths recorded under this head, all but ten were attributed to dysentery and hepatitis associated with abscess of the liver. The admission rate for diseases of the urinary system (107.39) exceeds that of the previous year by 18.91 per mille of strength. The invaliding ratio (0.72) is exactly double. There were eight invalids.

Both were delicate; in one it was attributed to indulgence in unripe jungle fruit; in the other to having eaten some tank fish. The result was fatal in both cases. On 2nd October a fatal case occurred in a woman of 2/13th Regiment at Bellary. Attack attributed to free indulgence in cucumber and other indigestible substances. Two cases were recorded at Cannanore in 48th Regiment; both terminated fatally. Both men were prisoners undergoing imprisonment in cells. They were admit- ted to hospital on 7th Dcember. One had been in cells since 13th November 1878, the other since the 27th of same month. Several isolated cases of cholera had been reported among natives in the bazaars and borders of the cantonment. The cause of the attacks could not be traced. The cells were carefully inspected, but nothing insanitary was detected in them or their surroundings. No previous visitation of cholera had occurred in barracks or cells. There was no communication between the cell prisoners and any other locality where cholera had previously prevailed. Two fatal cases were recorded in detachment 48th Regiment Maliyapuram. Both occurred in November. The man first attacked had been in an infected locality and had there partaken of some sour and dirty toddy. The man subsequently attacked occupied the same barrack room. He had for nearly five years suffered from chronic diarrh6 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 8TH SEPTEMBER 1879, No. 5000. existed among the dhobies who washed for the Royal Artillery, but all communi- cation had ceased at the date on which the first case occurred. The condition of barracks, ration supplies, water, &c., was satisfactory. The condition of 2/16th and 1/21st Regimental barracks is likewise reported to have been satis- factory. There was nothing in the water or ration supplies to account for the attacks. A tank existed to windward of 2/16th barracks, and is said to have smelt offensively at times when closely approached; but it is situated about a quarter of a mile from the south end of the lines, and the occupants of the two bungalows nearest to it escaped. All the cases in 1/21st Regiment occurred in men under treatment in hospital for other diseases. All precautions as laid down by regulations were duly observed; the barracks of 2/16th and hospitals of both Infantry Regiments were vacated and their occupants placed in tents. These moves, although carried out during heavy rains, were beneficial in shaking off the disease, and were unattended with any injury to health from exposure. Subjoined are the remarks of the Principal Medical Officer of the Circle in connection with this outbreak: "The cholera cases which occurred among the European troops of the Hyderabad Subsidiary Force in the months of July and August 1878, though they cannot in any way be said to have been caused by local insanitary conditions, as the disease had been prevalent for some considerable time previously in and around cantonments among the civil native population, and also among natives in Government employ, yet there is little doubt the state of the weather generally, and, perhaps, the communication which necessarily must always exist between natives employed in barracks and their relatives and others outside, were considerable factors in introducing this disease. With the exception of two cases in the Royal Horse Artillery which recovered, the whole occurred in the lines occupied by 2/16th Regiment, which includes the General Infantry Hospital, where the cases of 1/21st Regiment took place. The lines are situated on a slight ridge running nearly north and south, and the barracks, which are built in an almost continuous line, face consequently east and west. Along the east side of the barracks runs a main road, and varying from about half a mile to a mile still further east is a low, long hill, chiefly composed of granite boulders, where the rifle range is made. At the back of the barracks, to the west, is some lowlying ground which in the rains is cultivated in places and rice crops sown, and there is a stream of water running down to it commencing in a drain which carries off the rainfall from the entrenchment (1/21st barracks) on its south side. This lowlying land and the tanks beyond it, into which the water eventually runs and collects, have always been a mostobjectionable feature in connection with these barracks, and have been frequently brought to the notice of the local authorities. At one time an attempt was made to try and stop the rice cultivation and improve the sanitary condition, but the amount of compensation was and probably will continue to be quite prohibitory. The land in question belongs to some chiefs of Hyderabad, with whom it is most difficult to interfere. At one of the lowest lying spots in this ground and directly to windward of the lines of 2/16th Regiment was a most objectionable collection of huts sprung up from time to time, probably without any authority, miserable and poor in the extreme. In these huts it was discovered some of the puckallies of 2/16th and 1/21st Regiments as well as some hospital servants lived, and though no cholera cases were known to have occurred here until the 18th or 19th August 1878, yet several took place after this date. As before stated, however, the free communica- tion which takes place between soldiers, natives employed in barracks, and other natives elsewhere, renders the tracing out of such matters an impossibility. The huts in question were demolished before the 2/16th Regiment returned to barracks from camp." Three cases of cholera (one fatal) occurred in E Battery, 6th Brigade, Royal Artillery, Kamptee, on 3rd, 6th, and 18th July respectively. All were tem- perate men. The disease existed among natives in the bazaars at the time. Two of the men occupied the same barrack-room and all three had been associated together. Three cases occurred in 33rd Regiment at same station on 10th, 12th, and 20th September respectively; of these, two died. The man first attacked had been in the bazaars where cholera existed. There was nothing in the construction of barracks,
MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 8TH SEPTMEBER 1879, No. 5000. 7 food, Waters &c., to account for the attacks. One of the men was admitted from barracks; the remaining two from tents in cholera camp. At Rangoon six cases (two fatal) were recorded in men of 89th Regiment and one in a child of the same corps; the latter recovered. The cases in men occurred between the 31st July and 3rd August. The disease was confined to the occupants of one barrack; it was a new barrack, and there was nothing in its position, construction, or surround- ing to account for it. It is reported that the two men first attacked had been in an infected locality, and that on the morning of their seizure they had eaten raw cucumbers and over-ripe pineapples. The case in the child occurred in December; no cause was traceable. At Thyetmyo two cases were recorded in men of 44th Regiment on 26th and 28th April respectively; both terminated fatally. These men occupied the same building. A fatal case had occurred in the bazaar a few days before. There was nothing in connection with barracks, food-supplies, water, &c., to account for it. The dry-earth system of conservancy was not in use. It has since been introduced. One case occurred at Tonghoo in a man of the Royal Artil- lery on 11th July and proved fatal, He had been fishing a few days before in an infected locality. The solitary case recorded at Poonamallee occurred on 7th August in a gunner of the Royal Artillery, who for three days previously had suffered from diarrh8 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 8TH SEPTEMBER 1879, No. 5000.

SUMMARY OF THE PREVAILING DISEASES. Febrile Group .10 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 8TH SEPTEMBER 1879, No. 5000. The death-rate, 74 per mille, exhibits an increase of 65 only. Of cases returned under this head, 1,592 were ague and 175 remittent fever. There were eight deaths against one in 1877; all were due to remittent fever. Compared with 1877 all circles show an increase, particularly the Presidency Circle, where the admission ratio, 306.24 per mille, indicates an increase of 249.18 per mille of strength. These fevers were most prevalent at Bellary, where in 2/13th Regiment 416 admissions were recorded from them against 75 in the Infantry Regiment located there in 1877. In the Royal Artillery, Bellary, the admissions under this head amounted to 117 against 28 in the year preceding. The causes to which this prevalence is attributed have been enumerated in the preceding paragraph. In the Hyderabad Circle this class of fevers prevailed most in the Royal Artillery and 2/16th Regiment, Secunderabad, and in the 33rd Regiment, Kamptee. The bulk of the cases of ague recorded in the Royal Artillery, Secunderabad, occurred in 14/8th Brigade located in a mud fort. They occurred chiefly during the prevalence of the south-west monsoon in September, October and November, and were attributed mainly to the close proximity of the barracks to a large stretch of swampy ground lying immediately to windward. The cases were mild and were chiefly of the quotidian type. Of the cases recorded in 2/16th Regiment it is remarked: "relapses were frequent, so that the number of admissions includes many re-admissions." They were attributed to malarious emanations from wet ground in the vicinity. Enteric fever, so-called, shows a very decided reduction as compared with the year preceding, the admission ratio for the command, 64 per mille, showing a reduction of 5.26 per mille. Seven cases and five deaths were recorded against 65 cases and 22 deaths in 1877. A good deal of this decrease is probably due simply to a change in nomenclature, diseases returned as enteric fever in 1877 being classed under the heads of simple continued and remittent fever in 1878. The result of personal inquiries made by me only tends to strengthen the opinions expressed in my first special report on this disease, viz., that so-called enteric fever, due to pythogenic or filth causes, does not exist among British troops in this command; that the cases of late years designated as of enteric or typhoid fever are in their actual nature such as were formerly looked upon as induced by endemic and climatorial influences acting upon recent arrivals and modified by individual temperament, constitution and habits, these terms being applied in a specific sense on the one hand as indicative of a particular complication, on the other of a condition of the general state of fever. The cases recorded as of this disease were confined during 1878 entirely to the Hyderabad Circle, their distri- bution being as follows:11 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 8TH SEPTEMBER 1879, No. 5000.

MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 8TH SEPTEMBER 1879, No. 5000. 13 It was most prevalent at Thyetmyo, where nine cases (four fatal) were furnished by the 44th Regiment. All of these occurred between the 27th and 29th May, five being recorded on the 28th May. These attacks were attributed to a peculiarly moist condition of the atmosphere which prevailed at the time combined with high temperature. No case could be traced directly to intemperance. Some of the men attacked were total abstainers. A fatal case of hydrophobia was recorded in a man of B Battery, 6th Brigade, Royal Artillery, Bellary. He was admitted on 17th June and died the following day. On inquiry it was ascertained that he and three other men had been bitten by a dog about two months prior to admission, but the matter was not reported, nor was surgical aid applied for. The deceased was the first man bitten. All four men were bitten on the same date, but none of the others suffered subsequently. The symptoms in this case were very characteristic. The admission and death ratios for diseases of the circulatory system, 15.99 and 1.19 per mille, respectively, are almost identical with those of 1877. The invaliding ratio (4.50) shows an increase of.69 as compared with the year preced- ing. Aneurism caused eleven admissions and two deaths against fourteen admis- sions and nine deaths in 1877. Diseases of the Absorbent System furnished 317 admissions, but caused no mortality or invaliding. The admission ratio, 29.14 per mille, shows a reduction of 9.35 per mille as compared with 1877. The chief admissions were due to inflam- matory affections of the inguinal glands, many of which were no doubt the sequel of venereal disease, which was very prevalent throughout the year and caused much inefficiency. Diseases of the Digestive System furnished 3,593 admissions, or a ratio of 330.24 per mille of strength. The ratio exceeds that of 1877 by 15.70 per mille. The death-rate, 6.89, exceeds that of the previous year by 1.53. Of 75 deaths recorded, 28 were due to dysentery and 40 to hepatitis, either alone or combined with abscess of the liver. The chief admission causes were dysentery (974), diarrh14 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 8TH SEPTEMBER 1879, No. 5000. Artillery at Secunderabad entertain different views in regard to the causation of these diseases. One considers that hepatitis and dysentery may have been caused by climatic conditions. He could not trace them to diet, chills, or intemperance. Another remarks that climate has a large and primary influence in causing gastric and intestinal diseases, and hepatitis. He cannot clearly specify what these climatic influences are. He considers that excess in the use of stimulants exerts a decided influence in the production of hepatic diseases. He was unable to trace any ill effects to diet, and believed that many cases of dysentery and hepatitis were caused by chills at night. A third medical officer attributes the dyspepsia in his battery to drink, and the dysentery to climate in the majority of the cases. In no case does he arribute it to diet. The diarrhMILITARY DEPARTMENT, 8TH SEPTEMBER 1879, No. 5000. 15 attributed to drink, and diarrhoea to intemperance in eating and drinking.

MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 8TH SEPTEMBER 1879, No. 5000. 19 In Table E are shown the average strength, average daily sick, admissions and deaths at the several stations and circles, and the average admission and death rate for the preceding ten years is also exhibited for comparison. Compared with the average admission and death rates of the ten preceding years, the following results are noted in the various circles, viz.:20 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 8TH SEPTEMBER 1879, No. 5000. 7 in 1877; at Bangalore 18 against 24; at Thyetmyo 11 against 12; and at Port Blair 1 against 2 in 1877. The death-rate at Trichinopoly shows a marked increase, viz., 14 deaths against 4, or a ratio of 52.04 per mille as compared with 14.04 in 1877. There were 2 deaths from cholera and 3 from sunstroke, neither of which had caused any mortality in the year preceding. At Cannanore the increased death-rate is due to a greater mortality from diseases of the digestive system, 5 deaths being recorded from this cause against 2 in 1877. Cholera contributed 2 deaths against none in the previous year. At Secunderabad 62 deaths were recorded against 37 in 1877, the death ratio, 25.09, showing an increase of 9.68 per mille. This increase is chiefly due to cholera and diseases of the digestive system; 12 deaths from the former occurred against 3 in 1877, and 23 from the latter against 9 in the year pre- ceding. Kamptee shows 16 deaths against 5 in 1877. The increase is chiefly due to deaths from small-pox and cholera, which in 1877 caused no mortality. Fourteen deaths are recorded at Tonghoo against 7 in 1877, giving ratios of 35.18 and 16.78 respectively. Remittent fever, cholera, and dysentery furnished together 6 deaths; none of these had caused any mortality in 1877. Hepatitis and abscess of the liver caused 4 deaths against 1 in the previous year.

There does not seem to be much force in what is said by the medical officer at Wellington. A soldier can always find leisure enough to drink as much as he wishes. Arrangements, however, have been made by providing a rifle range and by every man bringing his rifle to the Depôt, to give more opportunities for drill and match-shooting than used to be the case, and the Com- mandant does his best to provide occupation and amusement for the men.

The barrack of the Royal Artillery was formerly a private dwelling; it is not well suited for a barrack. During the year important alterations have been made in the barracks of the Infantry at Kamptee, five of the blocks were remodelled and heightened. Guard Rooms and Cells.6 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 13TH OCTOBER 1880, No. 6462. Canteen .MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 13TH OCTOBER 1880, No. 6462. 7 The Royal Artillery were quartered in casemates in the fort; the rooms have a south- east exposure, have verandahs on one side, and are ventilated chiefly by the door and window spaces; improvements in the ventilation were attempted during the year. The average amount of cubic space to each man was 1,350 feet. It is proposed to construct other barracks for the Royal Artillery next year. The married quarters are in buildings not casemated; they are said to be very commodious, and to have been in good sanitary condition. The latrines (on the dry-earth system) were well kept: the refuse was removed twice a day, and disposed of by burying, at a distance from the fort.

A regiment of Cavalry, three batteries of Royal Artillery, part of a regiment and a detach- ment of Infantry were stationed at Bangalore. The cantonment occupies a large extent of ground; in general features the barracks and accessory accommodation for every corps are very similar. In the sanitary reports received, no exception is taken by any one of the medical officers to the lodging, food, clothing, duties, &c., &c., of the men; the various barracks are said to be spacious, well ventilated and clean, their environs in good order, the latrine accommodation12 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 13TH OCTOBER 1880, NO. 6462.

The ventilation is by opposite doors and windows, further increased in the upper rooms by swing windows and in the lower ones by openings in the walls near the floors and at the ceilings. During the year they afforded 1,145 cubic and 76 feet of surface space to each of the men quartered in them. They were limewhited twice. Married Quarters .14 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 13TH OCTOBER 1880, No. 6462. The station of Secunderabad is six miles from the town of Hyderabad; it occupies a ridge 1,900 feet above sea level on which at wide intervals the barracks and hospitals of the various corps are placed. Three miles north of Secunderabad is Trimulgherry, which may either be said to be a part of Secunderabad station, or a distinct cantonment; the Cavalry and part of the Artil- -lery are stationed at Trimulgherry. The ridge is composed of primary rock, boulders of which are strewn over its surface singly or are heaped together in piles; the low grounds on each side and at either end where the watershed of the ridge stagnates are marshy or cultivated in rice; numerous tanks occupy part of the area. The superficial soil of the ridge is a coarse loose sand derived from the disintegration of the granite, its permeability favors the rapid drying up of the surface after rain. An entrenched camp is placed on a favorable part of the ridge, and part of the Royal Artillery and of the Infantry are quartered in it.

The diseases under which illness caused by a debauch of drink (as distinguished from habitual drink- ing) are usually shewn are simple continued fever and febricula; in the present year the combined admissions from them were 1,370: it would not probably be an overstatement to say that one-fifth of this number were due directly to drink. The amount of indirect causation of disease by drunkenness cannot be guessed, nor can it be shewn in how many instances accidental or other injuries had their origin in this habit. An example of the extent to which the efficiency of the force is weakened by the intemperance in drink of so many of its members is illustrated in a battery of Royal Artillery, which arrived in the country in the beginning of the year.

Sanitary2 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 19TH AGUGUST 1881, NO. 4447. This latrine is said to be in the best site that can be selected for the purpose, and the Municipality has been called upon to have the latrine carefully looked after, so as to make it as little offensive as possible. If the latrine did not exist, the nuisance would probably be much greater than it is. Page 4. V.MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 19TH AUGUST 1881, No. 4447. 3 Bangalore. 4 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 19TH AUGUST 1881, No. 4447. DRAINAGE. During the year, the nuisance created by the drainage of the town at Madras has been greatly abated by the construction of a high-level sewer into which the sewage of the drain is pumped, eventually being delivered into the sea. At Thayetmyo, the environs of the Infantry barracks have been greatly improved by surface drainage. At Bangalore, surface channels have also been constructed for the compound of the Cavalry barracks, and the Damloor Tank there has been partially bunded; an attempt to drain the marsh on the north side of the tank was also made. At Bellary, the surface drainage of the Infantry barrack is reported to be badly laid, and unequal in capacity to the carrying off of the rainfall, some of which lodges. The drainage of the surface of the environs of the Infantry barrack at Rangoon is reported to be quite insufficient; there are swampy hollows and in the wet season at times communication between one block of buildings and another is difficult. At Secunderabad, the marshy hollows near the entrenchment barracks are supposed to affect the health of the troops there injuriously. House Drainage. MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 19TH AUGUST 1881, No. 4447. 5 were rather criticised than explained; so the strong presumption of the enteric fever cases being due to a water-poisoning was not overthrown. No more cases came forward after the well was closed. On examination, the shaft of the well was found to have two openings through which drainage evidently percolated; the well was only four paces from one of the wash-houses in use, and the site of the latrines had until lately been at an inconsiderable distance from the well. More than one fallacy may be contained in the supposed proofs connecting the enteric fever outbreak with the use of the water of the suspected well; the case is one of presumption only, arrived at after the possibility of every other source of infection had been excluded. The strong point of the theory lies in the fact, that the proportion of attacks amongst professed teetotallers was 1 in 7.5 of their number, whilst amongst non-teetotallers it was only 1 in 46. The doubtfulness of the purity of the present supply taken in connexion with the compara- tive scarcity of water at Kamptee, is held to justify the recommendation of a proposed scheme by which water, taken from another and better-protected source, would be delivered in the barracks by gravitation. CANTEENS. Progress has been made during the year in the provision of buildings better fitted by their spaciousness and cheerfulness for the accommodation of the men in such comfort as they appreciate, than the old canteens. New rooms have been occupied at the Infantry barrack of the entrenchment at Secunderabad, and a new canteen is nearly ready for the use of the Infan- try barrack at Rangoon. Many of the medical officers again record their belief as to the injury accruing from the optional allowance of spirits to be obtained at the canteen. No assistance is afforded by the returns of sickness to an estimation of the comparative prevalence of drinking habits, now and in preceding years; the diseases due to drink are classed arbitrarily, unless in the instances of delirium tremens, or of poisoning by alcohol. The medical officer of the 89th Foot gives a statement contrasting the amount of beer consumed by the men of that regiment (as shown in the Commissariat Returns) and that consumed by a battery of Royal Artillery, at the same place, in the summer of the year. For the 89th, the proportion is 1.6 pints per man per diem; for the Royal Artillery it is nearly 8. This striking contrast permits of a hopeful augury of the advance of temperance in drink amongst the men. The possible origination of sickness amongst the men from the use of effervescing drinks rendered hurtful by manufacture with contaminated water, has received attention; at Kamptee, at Secunderabad and at other places, the water used by the bazaar makers was analysed. It might, perhaps, be well to issue such beverages through Commissariat agency. CLOTHING. A small and a daily decreasing proportion of the men are still unprovided with the regula- tion grey hunting shirt. DUTIES. These have not been hurtful except in perhaps one instance, in which the number of nights in bed of the men of a battery of Royal Artillery averaged for a short time between one and two only; the medical officer thought that the short intervals between the men's guards aggravated the prevalence of ague, then epidemic. On representation, the duty was at once directed to be lessened. RECREATIONS AND AMUSEMENTS. Everything practically obtainable in these matters is provided for the men; they are often apathetic about formal amusements, but the remedy for this is not easy to find. HOSPITALS. The hospital buildings in the command are commonly in very good order and sanitarily have been well cared for; no sickness originating in hospital defects has been recognised amongst the patients. An important concession was made during the year, in the permission to use punkahs in the hot season for the whole twenty-four hours, should the administrative medical officer consider it necessary. At Kamptee and at Rangoon, new hospitals are required for the Infantry regiments respectively quartered at those places; one of the regiments at Thayetmyo, supernumerary to the usual garrison, used a converted barrack for a hospital; and the detachment at Malapuram used a chapel temporarily.

Thus the average annual admissions in the ten years' period amounted to 3017.2, whereas in the year under review there was a total of 4,636 admissions for continued and paroxysmal fevers. As regards the latter, their prevalence fluctuates greatly from year to year, and although to some extent dependent on sanitary conditions, it is still more so on seasonal peculiarities, which can neither be foreseen nor controlled.

8 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 29TH AUGUST 1881, No. 4647. Sickness amongst Officers.MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 29TH AUGUST 1881, No. 4647. 9 vorable reports were received as to the cooking of food, but some cook-houses were reported as smoky. A new cook-house was provided for the Royal Artillery at Thayetmyo. CANTEENS. Improved buildings were in course of being provided. Strong objections were recorded by some medical officers regarding the optional allowance of spirits to be got from the canteens. At Kamptee, Secunderabad and other places, the purity of aërated waters was investigated. As they are chiefly made by native dealers, there is always the risk of impure water being employed. DRAINAGE. At Madras, arrangements were made by which the nuisance, to residents in the Fort, of the main drain was greatly abated, the sewage being now pumped up into a high-level sewer and discharged at a distance into the sea. At Banga- lore, surface drainage was extended around the Cavalry barracks, and various improvements in other quarters carried out. The drainage of the Infantry barracks, Bellary and Rangoon, was reported defective, and at Secunderabad the proximity of marsh to the entrenchment barracks was considered unfavorable to the health of the troops. LATRINES. The dry-earth system was in operation. The buildings were in general well designed, the number of conservancy servants sufficient and the disposal of the night-soil judicious. From inattention there were at times defects in the working of the system, but these were remedied as soon as possible. During the year, the latrines at Poonamallee were reconstructed, and new ones built for the Royal Artil- lery at Thayetmyo, Infantry at Kamptee, and married quarters, Secunderabad. CLOTHING. The whole of the men were not provided with colored flannel shirts. DUTIES. These were not hurtful. In one instance, it was believed that the too frequent recurrence of guard duty aggravated the prevalence of ague. On representations the defect was attended to. No. 1.

Sickness amongst Officers. 10 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 4TH OCTOBER 1882, No. 5251. WATER-SUPPLY. The distribution of the water-supply in the hospital at Madras does not reach the upper floor of the building. At Bangalore the supply distributed to the troops was tested at various times and pronounced safe. The supply at Bellary flows from the well-head in an open masonry drain and is thus subject to pollution. The water-supply at Kamptee was carefully looked after and pronounced of fair quality, but a scheme for an improved supply was being discussed. Generally speaking, the reports on the quality of the water supplied to the troops were favorable. FOOD AND COOKING. No change took place in the scale of rations, and the quality of the articles gave satisfaction. CANTEENS. A new canteen for the Infantry was finished at Secunderabad and is reported to be commodious and well-ventilated. The liquors supplied in the canteens were chiefly beer, porter, rum, and arrack. Aërated waters were also on sale. They are reported to have been of good quality. The liberty to purchase beer freely from the canteen seems of doubtful propriety, as there can be no doubt that it leads men to think that they can consume any quantity of the liquor with impunity. There can be no doubt also that in this country it is nearly, if not quite, as prejudicial as spirits to men with a tendency to hepatic disease. Popular opinion is not always a safe guide, but it is a well-known fact that beer is now very rarely drunk by the better class of Europeans in this country. The great difficulty is that, if the men are not allowed to purchase liquors in the canteen, they will resort to the bazaar and consume vile compounds vended as beer and brandy. CLOTHING. The clothing of the troops was generally well adapted for the climate, and changed according to season. DUTIES. These were of the usual character and not prejudicial to health. RECREATION AND AMUSEMENT. Special recreation and reading rooms were provided, out-of-door games and gymnastics encouraged, and soldiers' gardens and other means of recreation fostered. From various causes it is very difficult to provide the men with amusement in India, but anything in that shape which will draw them away from the canteen and bazaar is advisable, and abundant physical exercise is the best preventive against drinking and debauchery.

On the whole, considering that these men were in their native climate, while the Madras troops were exposed to the depressing influences and diseases of tropical service, their health state in 1882 does not contrast unfavor- ably with that of men serving in Great Britain. It may safely be said, therefore, that the constant attention which has for years been devoted to the sanitation of military buildings and to everything likely to improve the health of the European force in this command, has been productive of good results. 5. As regards the Native troops of this presidency, their admission-rate per mile was 357.86 less than, while their death and invaliding rates were, respectively, 2.96 and 13.71 in excess of, the corresponding ratios for Europeans. 6. The table (No. 1) contrasts in detail the health statistics of British troops in the command in 1882 with the figures for 1881. 7.

6 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 3RD DECEMBER 1883, No. 6524. Excluding the convalescent depôts of Poonamallee and Wellington and the small stations of Calicut, Malapuram, Port Blair and Sitabuldi, Cannanore shows the lowest admission, average daily sick and death-rates of any station in the com- mand. The troops at Secunderabad were also very healthy; but the death-rate, 9.44 per mille of strength, was higher than at some other stations. Next to Secunderabad, Thayetmyo shows the smallest amount of sickness, but it had a comparatively high death-rate, 10.57 per mille. Bellary had a higher admission rate than any of the other larger stations, but the death-rate was moderate, viz., 8.42 per 1,000 men. The diseases most prevalent at Bellary were ague and venereal complaints. Kamptee, Tonghoo, and Bangalore also show high admission rates, and the death-rate at the last-named station was heavy. 10.

LATRINES AND ABLUTION-ROOMS. The dry-earth system is carried out in all latrines, and the poudrette carefully removed to a distance. The automatic seats at St. Thomas' Mount are said to be efficient, supplying a sufficiency of dry earth, every time they are used. The venti- lation of the latrines in Fort St. George is reported as being still defective. At Bangalore it was found that collections of general refuse and poudrette from latrines were being deposited too near one of the hospitals, but this possible source of danger was at once put a stop to on being brought to notice. One of the urinals of the infantry barracks, Bangalore, is to be roofed. There are ample means of ablution in all barracks, and in some stations there are plunge-baths. New wash- houses were being constructed for the infantry barracks at Kamptee. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. Barracks, hospitals, and buildings generally were kept in as good order as pos- sible and various improvements carried out, but others are still necessary in the direction of drainage and the sanitation of the neighbourhood of public buildings. WATER-SUPPLY. Constant attention was devoted to this important matter, and periodical analyses were made in the various cantonments of the water in use for drinking purposes. The results of the chemical examination of the waters were generally satisfactory, and there can be no doubt that the periodical analyses caused stricter attention to be paid to the conservancy of the sources of supply. It would be well, however, if all water used for drinking and cooking purposes by the troops could be distributed in pipes. The source of the water-supply at Bangalore, the Ulsur lake, was in the usual unsatisfactory state. Some action must be taken to introduce a superior water-supply to this station, as otherwise it may become untenable by troops. FOOD AND COOKING. The rations were reported to be, as a rule, good and sufficient. New cook- houses were erected at Kamptee; but the Deputy Surgeon-General considers their site objectionable, as they interfere with the free perflation of wind from the north- east to the barracks. In some stations the kitchens are said to be "smoky," owing to the bad construction of the chimneys. CANTEENS. The quality of the beer, rum, and arrack was generally good, but Deputy Sur- geon-General Chapple advocates the abolition of a spirit ration for the men. Coffee shops are established in most stations. CLOTHING. No change was made in the clothing of the men, except the substitution of "khaki " for "white" drill. DUTIES. The duties were of the usual routine character, and the number of nights the men got in bed was carefully attended to. The S/lst, Royal Artillery, contracted cholera in the Berars while marching from Kamptee to Bangalore. The disease was epidemic in the district at the time, and there were seven admissions and four deaths in the battery. RECREATION AND AMUSEMENT. Every effort was made to provide the men with means of recreation and amuse- ment.
MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 3RD DECEMBER 1883, No. 6524. 11 HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION. The station hospital system was adopted from the 1st of April 1882, and promised to work well and to effect some pecuniary saving. There was no over- crowding, and the sanitation of the buildings and their surroundings received unceasing attention. New station hospitals were in contemplation for Kamptee, Rangoon, and Tonghoo.

Return showing the mortality in and out of hospital No. 3. Return showing the prevalence and mortality of the different classes of diseases. I have the honor to forward, for the information of the Right Honorable the Governor in Council, the usual brief report on the health of British troops in the Madras command in 1883, as also the statements specified in the margin. 2. The annual average strength of non-commissioned officers and men was 10,612, the number of admissions into hospital 10,517, and the total deaths 108. The number of invalids sent to England was 347. The ratios per 1,000 obtained from these figures are for admis- sions 991.05, deaths 10.18, and invalids 32.70. Comparing these results with the corresponding figures for 1882, they show a decrease of 78.01 per 1,000 in admis- sions, and of 0.36 in mortality, but an increase of 3.03 in the invaliding rate. Of the invalids sent home, 19.13 per 1,000 were for change of climate, and 13.57 for discharge from the service. The average number constantly sick in the force was 633.79, while the average sick time for each soldier was 23.77, and the average duration of each ease of sickness 23.98 days. A. 2 4. The annexed table No. 1 contrasts in detail the health statistics of the troops in 1883, with those for 1882. 5. The following abstract shows the admissions, deaths, and invaliding in the different classes and orders of diseases:3 command was less by 46.27 per 1,000 than in 1882, but the death rate for both years was the same, viz., 0.28 per 1,000. Cholera was very prevalent amongst the civil population, and there occurred 19 cases and 10 deaths amongst the troops, giving an admission and death rate of 1.79 and 0.94, respectively, per 1,000, against 1.39 and 0.83 in 1882. Ten of the cases occurred in the Nagpore Circle, five at Secunderabad, three on the march, and one in Bellary. Constitutional group of diseases. 4 gun-shot wound.

Officers. 9 was good. There is some land under wet cultivation near the 2nd Infantry Barracks which it would be desirable to drain and plant with trees, but this has not yet been found practicable. The drainage of the barracks was improved. The married quarters were clean and afforded ample accommodation, but some of the roofs of the infantry quarters required repairs. Kamptee. 10 needs improvement, being an old and inferior building. The quality of the liquors supplied are generally favorably reported on. Clothing was suitable and varied according to season. One administrative officer does not approve of the khaki clothing, and says it leads to dirty habits. Duties and Exercise.11 No. 2.

LOCAL DISEASES. Diseases of theIP/25/AF.4 I.P. SANITARY REPORT OF BRITISH TROOPS IN THE MADRAS COMMAND FOR 1884. The health of the British Troops in this Command was generally satisfactory during the past year, and seeing that a similar statement was made during each of the previous four years, it may be assumed that the sanitary conditions of their surroundings in the Madras Presidency are on the whole favorable. Cholera was very prevalent in most of Southern India and there was a very large mortality among the civil population, so that the troops got off wonderfully with only twelve cases and ten deaths. There was a good deal of small-pox also at several stations, while the troops escaped with nineteen cases, most of which were mild, and only one death. ENTERIC FEVER has increased steadily during the last four years, the increase being most marked at Bangalore, where the water-supply is always bad, and where it was scanty as well as bad in 1884. It seems probable, therefore, that the quality of the water has something to do with the spread of this disease, but seeing that there were many cases at Secunderabad also, where the water supplied to all the barracks is good, there must be other agencies at work. At all military stations there are several more or less isolated collections of huts occupied by the lowest and poorest classes of the population where filth of all kinds abounds and the soldier, and especially the young unmarried soldier, is fond of wandering among these in search of prostitutes and drink. There has been no improvement in the number of cases of venereal, and the general impression among Medical officers is that the lock hospital system, as worked in this country, has proved of no use whatever to the soldier. BARRACKS2 At Secunderabad, No. 6 range of the married quarters of the 1st British Infantry Regiment was converted into a general female hospital for the women and children of the two Infantry Regiments and the Artillery, while No. 7 range was allotted as a contagious disease ward for the same persons. A new hospital is in course of construction at Tonghoo on an improved site and will probably be open for use early in 1886. Guard Rooms and Cells.3 No.11.Diseases. August. September. October.

KENNEY-HERBERT, Officiating Secretary to Government, Military Department; dated Ootacamund, 30th September 1885, No. 305. No. 1. Return showing the sickness, mortality and invaliding. No. 2. Return showing the mortality in and out of hospital. No. 3. Return showing the prevalence and mortality of the different classes of diseases. I have the honor to forward, for the information of the Right Honorable the Governor in Council, the three tabular statements specified in the margin, with a brief report on the health of British Troops serving in the Madras Command in 1884. 2. The annual average strength of non-commissioned officers and men was 10,812, the number of admissions into hospital 11,960, and the total deaths 93. The number of invalids sent to England was 350. The ratios per 1,000 obtained from these figures are for admissions 1,106.18, deaths 8.60, and invalids 32.37. Comparing these results with the corresponding figures for 1883, they show an increase of 115.13 per 1,000 in admissions, but a decrease of 1.58 in mortality, and of.33 in the invaliding rate. Of the invalids sent home 20.90 per 1,000 were for change of climate, and 11.47 for discharge from the service. The average number constantly sick in the force was 639.49, while the average sick time for each soldier was 23.22, and the average duration of each case of sickness 20.99 days. A. 2 4. The following table shows the sickness, mortality and invaliding from the chief diseases and groups of diseases:3 1884, yet the mortality rate has fallen from 2.12 to 1.67, and the deaths to treated from 479.17 to 134.33. Bangalore, Secunderabad and Kamptee head the list, the first with sixty admissions, the second with thirty-nine, and the third with fifteen. Cannanore follows with four admissions, and in three of these cases the disease was apparently contracted on the line of march. Bellary and Port Blair contribute three each. These are the first cases which have been treated at Port Blair. St. Thomas' Mount, Malapuram, Wellington and Thayetmyo contribute one case each, and one occurred on the line of march.

Nothing has yet been done beyond making surveys and elabo- rating schemes towards improvement in the supply. At Bellary also the water- supply was a source of anxiety, the rainfall for the year at that station having been only 7 inches, the average being about 19. The water at Cannanore is obtained from wells and is ordinarily very good, but about the beginning of the south-west monsoon, the water from the two much used wells near the sea contains too much chlorine as if from percolation of sea water through the laterite. When this is the case the water from these wells is condemned. COOKING AND RATIONS.11 No. 2. RETURN showing the MORTALITY in and out of HOSPITAL in Her Majesty's BRITISH TROOPS during the Year 1884.

LOCAL DISEASES. Diseases of theIP/25/AF.4 I.P. From J. IRVINE, Esq., M.D., Q.S.D., Surgeon-General, Her Majesty's Forces, Madras, to Lieutenant-Colonel A. KENNEY-HERBERT, Secretary to Government, Military Department; dated Fort St. George, 3rd November 1886, No. 2062. No. 1. Return showing the sickness, mortality and invaliding. No. 2. Return showing the mortality in and out of hospital. No. 3. Return showing the prevalence and mortality of the different classes of diseases. I have the honor to forward, for the information of Government, a brief report on the health of British troops serving in the Madras Command in 1885, together with the tabular statements specified in the margin. 2. The annual average strength of non-commissioned officers and men was 10,414, the total admissions into hospital 12,105, and the total deaths 97. The number invalided to England was 251. These results give the following ratios per 1,000 of strength, viz., for admissions 1,162.38, for deaths 9.31, and invaliding 24.10. Contrasting these with the corresponding ratios of the previous year, there is an increase of 56.20 in admissions, of 0.71 in deaths, and a decrease of 8.27 in invaliding. Of the invalids sent home, 12.77 per 1,000 were for change of climate and 11.33 for discharge from the service. The average number constantly sick in the force was 686, the average sick time for each soldier was 25.62, and the average duration of each case of sickness 22.04 days. A. 2 4. The following table shows the sickness, mortality, and invaliding from the chief diseases and groups of diseases:3 Of enteric fever, there were 73 cases and 23 deaths as compared with 129 and 18, respectively, in 1884. The largest number of admissions was recorded at Secunderabad, the total being 29 against 39 in 1884, and 28 in 1883. Bangalore followed next with 18 admissions against 60 in 1884 and 41 in 1883. The admis- sions at Bellary have risen from 3 in 1884 to 8 in 1885, and at Kamptee have fallen from 15 to 3. At Port Blair four cases occurred in January 1885. These were referred to in last year's report, when three admissions were recorded during the month of December 1884. The four cases now noted belonged to a detach- ment of the South Wales Borderers which arrived at Port Blair on 6th December 1884. This may be termed a local outbreak, as no cases occurred either at Fort St. George, where the South Wales Borderers were then stationed, or amongst the other troops which left Madras in the same ship and which went on to Burma. There were three admissions at Wellington and one at each of the following stations:4 the lowest ratio of admissions was in the Nagpore Force. The Eastern District, which headed the ratio of admissions last year, comes next to Kamptee as regards freedom from these affections. The ratio of admissions in the whole army was 232.76 against 229.19 in 1884, and the ratio of deaths 1.83 against 2.68. Venereal Diseases .5 Injuries.6 6.

IP/25/AF.4 I.P. SANITARY REPORT OF BRITISH TROOPS IN THE MADRAS COMMAND FOR 1885. The health of the British troops during the year under report may be considered satis- factory. Though it does not compare favorably with the year 1884, still it bears a favorable comparison with the previous ten years. Although cholera and small-pox were prevalent amongst the civil population, yet only six cases of the former, with two deaths and six cases of the latter, occurred during the year. To enteric fever is due 23.71 per cent. of the total deaths during the year. Nothing tangible has been elicited regarding the causation of enteric fever in this Presidency. As regards Bangalore, Brigade Surgeon Hunt reports: "The etiology of this fever still continues involved in uncertainty. The quality of the water-supply was doubtless suspicious, but every effort has been made by filtration, boiling and refiltration to minimize its deleterious quality. The hypothesis, however, that the Ulsoor water-supply is the sole and only cause of the disease, must be accepted with some reservation, when cases of so- called enteric fever are of constant occurrence among private families occupying well- constructed, isolated houses, where the water-supply is obtained from carefully-protected wells, and when we find the women and children in barracks, who are obviously water-drinkers, comparatively free from the disease. To the proximity of the Ulsoor tank and the emanations arising therefrom, has been attributed the prevalence of this fever, but in the case of the Agram barracks they are quite one and-a-half miles from the tank, are situated on the reverse slope of an intervening ridge and on the extreme flank of the tank, and consequently without the track of the prevailing monsoons." It has been alleged that the drying up of the tank is another cause of the disease, but this theory can scarcely be entertained, as the statistics of the last decade fail to show that the tank water-level exercises the slightest influence. Deputy Surgeon- General Rean is of opinion that the nature of the soil at Kamptee has a considerable influence in the production of enteric fever at that station; and, if not the only factor, is at least an important one in the etiology of the disease. The Medical Officers at Bellary and Secunderabad are of opinion that the men contract the disease in the native bazaars. It is the habit of the men to frequent these and indulge in native drinks, chiefly bad water, into which an effervescing powder is placed. BARRACKS. Eastern District .2 the rooms of the new barracks has not as yet been completed, and temporarily the old married quarters have been utilized for the accommodation of the single men. The old barracks at Cannanore are of faulty construction. They are too low pitched, the height duly admitting of single verandahs, and as these are too narrow, rain is liable to drift in on the monsoon side, unless the windows are closed. The barracks at Belgaum are favorably reported on. Hyderabad Subsidiary Force .3 ward. The following statement is taken from the designation boards of the wards of this building:4 attendants' room. It is a most elegant, cheerful and comfortable building. During its con- struction it was suggested that there should be no doorway ledges, so that dust could be easily swept out and a wheeled couch could travel more easily from the confinement room to the wards. In this respect, also, it therefore differs from the other blocks. The designation boards, which are not yet fixed, will give5 "A small male and female army hospital native corps latrine is in rear and adjacent to the conservancy receptacles. "The laundry is just built, but not yet fitted up. "The possession by this hospital of a well-appointed officers' ward has already been referred to. It remains to be said that it possesses another institution6 COOKING AND RATIONS There has been no change in the rations, except at St. Thomas' Mount and Madras, where Chicago beef was issued to the troops towards the end of the year. In Bellary the want of variety in the vegetable ration (potatoes and onions) is much felt. It has been proposed to open out a vegetable garden at Ramandroog, when the troops from Bellary visit it during the hot weather months. This will afford occupation to the troops stationed there and provide a supply of good fresh vegetables for Bellary. In November the question of the insufficiency of a half ration for boys under sixteen years of age was raised by the Officer Commanding the 2nd Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers, and referred to me for my opinion. In reply I stated that I considered it highly desirable, on account of health, that boys under sixteen years should have full rations.

IP/25/AF.4 I.P. From J. IRVINE, Esq ., M.D., Q.G.D., Surgeon-General, Her Majesty's Forces, Madras, to Brigadier-General A. KENNEY-HERBERT, Secretary to Government, Military Department; dated Fort St. George , 30th September 1887, No. 2842. No. 1. Return showing the sickness, mortality and in- validing. No. 2. Return showing the mortality in and out of hospital. No. 3. Return showing the prevalence and mortality of the different classes of diseases. I have the honor to forward, for the information of Government, a brief report on the health of British troops in the Madras Command in 1886, together with the tabular statements specified in the margin. 2. The average strength of British troops in the Madras Command in 1886 was 11,199, the number of admissions into hospital 15,296, the daily average sick 903, and a total of 182 deaths and 267 invalided. These results give the following ratios per 1,000 of strength, viz., for admissions 1,365.84, for deaths 16.25, and invaliding 23.84. Contrasting these with the corresponding ratios of the previous year, there is an increase of 203.46 in admissions, of 6.94 in deaths, but a decrease of 0.26 in invaliding. Of the invalids sent home, 13.75 per 1,000 were for change of climate, and 10.09 for discharge from the service. The average number constantly sick in the force was 903, the average sick time for each man was 29.43 days, and the average duration of each case of sickness 21.55 days. A. 2 4. The following table shows the sickness, mortality and invaliding which took place under the several groups of diseases:3 I. GENERAL DISEASES. Group A. Sub-group I4 The admissions for primary syphilis compare very favorably with that of last year, except in the Belgaum and Western districts, the increase in which is due to the fact that the lock hospital at Cannanore was closed from 1st April 1885 to 15th July 1886. The Senior Medical Officer of the Station Hospital, Cannanore, reports that, since the re-opening of the lock hospital (15th July), the cases of primary syphilis were of a mild form, and the secondary disease had greatly diminished, and, further states, since the 15th July only one admission for secondary syphilis has been due to disease contracted since that date. The following table compares the prevalence of secondary syphilis:5 Group C. Debility.6 Organs of locomotion.7 6.

Officers. 11 latter although not unhealthy are not so good as others. They are nearest to Secunderabad and not so open and airy, and there is a good deal of rocky ground around and some wet cultivation. They are not either so well built or so well finished as the rest. The 1st Infantry Regiment barracks are situated within the entrenchment and are rather closer together than others, but the ground is high and dry and the buildings are spacious and airy. The Artillery barracks are situated along a ridge running westerly, which is very good, and the situation of the Cavalry barracks is the best, being on an open plain well elevated and dry and airy. All the barracks are in good state of repair, and on the whole healthy and comfortable. The want of trees and shade is felt especially in the Cavalry barracks, but this will be remedied in time by the growth of trees which are being regularly planted in due season. There was some overcrowding in the Cavalry barracks after the arrival of the 7th Hussars on the 28th December, as this regiment was 600 strong, whereas the barracks were only intended for the old strength. To increase accommodation, it was found necessary to utilize the lower storey, recreation rooms, and other places not so intended as dormitories. Nagpore Forces.12 The north station hospital is also a long one-storied building on a good basement, well situated, dry and well drained; all the station hospitals are well supplied with good water. The hospital for women and children is not a very good one. It was one of the family quarters of the 1st British Infantry Regiment, and is consequently defective in many respects as a hospital.

IP / 25 / AF.4 SANITARY REPORT OF BRITISH TROOPS IN THE MADRAS. COMMAND DURING 1886. The health of the British troops for the year under report was not satisfactory, inas- much as there was a higher ratio of admissions and of deaths, though the invaliding was a fraction less. There was remarkable immunity from cholera and small-pox, only two cases of cholera and one death and only one case of small-pox. But enteric fever has increased enormously, the number admitted and the death for this year being nearly double those for last year, viz., 139 and 44 deaths against 73 and 23 deaths. No new light has been thrown on the causation of this disease in this command by the experience of the past year. As regards Bangalore, Surgeon-Major Dick reports that "the epidemic commences after rainfall in the heat of the year and attains its maximum intensity in July and August after a full rainfall. The opportunity of ingesting the poison, if on the fæces of native men, must in Bangalore therefore be great, for although a close drain carries off most of the offal of Bangalore, this drain has over-flowing catch-pits which communicate directly with the tank (and there is, moreover, a large latrine surface in the neighbouring nullahs which is scoured into it) which yields the drinking-water of the soldier." The Senior Medical Officer, South Station Hospital, Secunderabad, mentions as a probable source of the disease in many cases; "the passage of enteric evacuations into latrine pans in barracks, for there was during the past year incontestable evidence that some men who were admitted into hospital had a history of illness in barracks for some days before they reported sick and were taken in. Diarrh2 The situation of -the Ulsoor barracks is objectionable on account of its being close to the densly-populated native bazaar, the sanitary condition of which is often doubtful. The wards of the South Station Hospital were colored a light French gray during the last quarter of the year and the doors and windows painted; the drainage at Bellary is still defective owing to the almost dead level of the station. Certain defects in connection with the drains at the western end of the barracks at Bellary were brought to notice and removed. Belgaum and Western Districts. 3 filtered water always available for cooking and drinking The supply of water in the lavatories of the Kamptee barracks was rather limited. The conservancy of the hospitals and barracks was satisfactory and the establishment efficient. The following works were completed during the year:4 GENERAL. (1) Providing sun-shades to ventilators of Military prison. (2) Supplying coir fibre for floor of the central gymnasium. (3) Addition to bath room and night closet to prisoners' ward, South Station Hospital, and other petty alterations to the buildings.

IP/25/AF.4 I. P. From Sir J. A. HANBURY, M.B., K.C.B., Surgeon-General, Her Majesty's Forces, Madras, to Brigadier-General:A. KENNEY-HERBERT, Secretary to Government, Military Department; dated Fort St. George, 30th October 1888, No. 2919. No. 1. Return showing the sickness, mortality, and in- validing. No. 2. Return showing the mortality in and out of hospital. No. 3. Return showing the prevalence and mortality of the different classes of diseases. I have the honor to submit, for the information of Government, a brief report on the health of British troops in the Madras Command in 1887, together with the statements specified in the margin. 2. The average strength of British troops in the Madras Command in 1887 was 11,738, the number of admissions into hospital 14,574, the average daily sick 906, the total deaths 152, and invalided 364. These figures give a ratio of 1241.61 admissions, 77.26 average daily sick, 12.95 mortality, and 31.01 invalided per 1000 of strength. Contrasted with the corresponding ratios of the previous year, we find a decrease of 124.73 in admissions, of 3.37 in average daily sick, and of 3.20 in mortality, but an increase in invaliding of 7.17. Of the invalids, 17.55 per mille were sent for change of climate, and 13.46 for discharge from the service. The average sick time to each soldier was 28.20 days, and the average duration of each case of sickness 22.71 days, compared with 29.45 and 21.57, respectively, for 1886. 3. The health of the troops, during the year under notice, has been satisfac- tory, the ratio of admissions and deaths comparing favorably with those of last year, although that of invaliding was higher.

Officers .11 satisfactory. Exception is taken to the situation of the Ulsoor Barracks by Surgeon- Major Lewer, who states that they are too close to the Ulsoor native bazaar, the sanitary state of which is often doubtful. They have also not sufficient basement. The hospital accommodation has been sufficient and the sanitary arrangements effective. The south station hospital is described by Deputy Surgeon-General Tarrant as being somewhat defective in sanitary requirements, as compared with the more recently constructed hospitals. Of the station hospital, Belgaum, the Senior Medical Officer reports that "there is great need for a prisoners' ward, no special room being available, the building originally set apart for this purpose having been appropriated by a clerk of the Meteorological Department. The drainage of the barracks has been satisfactory. At Bangalore a small drain was constructed during the year to carry off water from the Sergeants' Mess, Royal Horse Artillery, and the drain leading from the married quarters of the Royal Artillery at Agram was extended further into the country. The sources of the Bangalore water-supply are the Ulsoor tank and Dhobies' wells adjoining, the water being pumped from them by steam-power and filtered before distribution through iron pipes to barracks, hospitals, &c. The Ulsoor tank source is reported as unsatisfactory, as the neighbourhood of the channels feeding it has been found contaminated by human excreta and other filth which is washed into the tank by the first heavy rain of the south-west monsoon. The western or chief feeder runs through the cantonment bazaar and is the main surface drain from that direction. Surgeon-Major Lewer, speaking of the water, says: "It is pronounced to be very suspicious or bad in quality from the amount of animal matter it usually contains." Before use by the troops, in addition to the filtration which it undergoes at the Ulsoor water works, it is boiled and again passed through Macnamara filters. At Belgaum the water has been good, but some of the wells ran dry during the hot weather; however, the supply was sufficient. Southern District.12 present such troops are usually placed in tents on the glacis, which is unsatisfactory as conservancy arrangements are difficult and the place is, in many ways, unsuited for a camping ground." Surgeon-Major Mackinnon says that " a foul sewage smell is often perceived from the main drain to the north of the Fort; " and the same officer, speaking of the water supplied to Fort St. George from the Seven Wells, states that, " as a potable water, it is indifferent, albuminoid ammonia existing in it to a large extent." At Fort St. George the kitchens used by the Infantry are reported as being in a dirty dilapidated condition. The canteen also is too small for the number using it. The latrines used by the Artillery and Infantry are badly constructed and difficult to keep clean. Hyderabad Subsidiary Force.13 The Central Station Hospital is well situated and its sanitation has been satisfactory. There was not sufficient accommodation, owing to the fact that several batteries over the usual strength were in the station for Artillery practice; tents had, therefore, to be pitched. Additional quarters for servants are desirable. The North Station Hospital is a long one-storied building, well situated, well ventilated, and comfortable. The Hospital for Women and Children is not a good one; it was formerly one of the family quarters of the 1st B. I. Regiment, subsequently converted into a hospital. It has been found defective in many ways for cases under treatment there, and inconvenience has resulted for want of a suitable ward for contagious diseases. A well-constructed female hospital is much to be desired.

IP / 25 / AF.4 From Brigadier-General M. C. FARRINGTON, C.B.,Adjutant-General, Madras Army, to Brigadier-General A. KENNEY-HERBERT, Secretary to Gov- ernment, Military Department; dated Madras, 1st March 1889, No. 500-BA. (Sanitary2 altered drainage; but as the place is an eyesore, and reported to be in an insanitary condition after the rains, the necessary orders will be issued in view to the locality being carefully inspected during the monsoon, to admit of some other and less costly measures being found for remedying the evil complained of. MADRAS DISTRICT. 5. Position of the Station Hospital at Madras.3 Lavatory and Latrine accommodation for British Cavalry at Secunderabad.4 At Secunderabad, Bangalore, Malapuram and other stations the drinking of bazaar-made liquors is ascribed by the various Medical officers as a probable cause, while at Kamptee, the Deputy Surgeon-General mentions the great difficulty in getting pure milk. It has often been found watered, and it is scarcely necessary to observe that, not unfrequently, outbreaks of enteric fever in England have had their origin traced to the drinking of milk diluted with a contaminated water. BANGALORE DIVISION INCLUDING BELGAUM AND CEDED DISTRICTS. The Belgaum District was transferred to the Medical administration of the Bangalore Division on the 1st January 1887, while Trichinopoly and Wellington, which were previously included in this division, are now in the Southern District. The general health of the troops in the division has been good. The sanitary state of the barracks and buildings connected with them is reported as having been satisfactory. Exception is taken to the situation of the Ulsoor barracks by Surgeon-Major Lewer who states that they are too close to the Ulsoor Native bazaar, the sanitary state of which is often doubtful. They have also not sufficient basement. The hospital accommodation has been sufficient and sanitary arrangements effective. The South Station hospital is described by Deputy Surgeon-General Tarrant as being somewhat defective in sanitary requirements, as compared with the more recently constructed hospitals. Of the Station hospital, Belgaum, the Senior Medical officer reports that there is great need for a prisoners' ward, no special room being available, the building originally set apart for this purpose having been appropriated by a clerk of the Meteorological Department. The drainage of the barracks has been satisfactory. At Bangalore, a small drain was constructed during the year to carry off water from the Sergeants' mess, Royal Horse Artillery, and the drain leading from the married quarters of the Royal Artillery at Agram was extended further into the country. The sources of the Bangalore water-supply are the Ulsoor tank and Dhobies' wells adjoin- ing, the water being pumped from them by steam power and filtered before distribution, through iron pipes, to barracks, hospitals, &c. The Ulsoor tank source is reported as unsatisfactory, as the neighbourhood of the channels feeding it has been found contaminated by human excreta and other filth which is washed into the tank by the first heavy rain of the south-west monsoon. The western or chief feeder runs through the Cantonment bazaar and is the main surface drain from that direction. Surgeon-Major Lewer, speaking of the water, says:5 The Deputy Surgeon-General reports that "some place of shelter for troops passing through, sufficient for the temporary accommodation of about 100 men, is urgently required owing to the number constantly passing to and from Burma; at present such troops are usually placed in tents on the glacis which is unsatisfactory, as conservancy arrangements are difficult, and the place is, in many ways, unsuited for a camping ground." Surgeon-Major Mackinnon says that "a foul sewage smell is often perceived from the main drain to the north of the Fort," and the same officer, speaking of the water supplied to Fort St. George from the Seven-wells, states that, "as a potable water, it is indifferent, albumi- noid ammonia existing in it to a large extent." At Fort St. George the kitchens used by the Infantry are reported as being in a dirty, dilapidated condition. The canteen also is too small for the number using it. The latrines, used by the Artillery and Infantry, are badly constructed and difficult to keep clean. HYDERABAD SUBSIDIARY FORCE. The general health of the troops in this division has been indifferent. The barracks are generally well built, well situated, and commodious. The 2nd British Infantry barracks, which are nearest to Secunderabad, are not so well built, open and airy as the others, and have a good deal of rocky ground and some wet cultivation in their vicinity. The Cavalry and Artillery barracks are very well situated on open elevated dry ground and are comfortable and healthy. All the buildings in connection with the barracks at Secunderabad have been kept in good repair. The Deputy Surgeon-General reports that some of the barracks are too much exposed to the force of the wind during the monsoon, and that they thus become draughty. The want of shade is reported to be felt, particularly in the Cavalry and 1st British Infantry barracks. Planting of trees is, however, being carried on, but they take a considerable time to grow to any size. The accommodation in the Cavalry barracks has been defective. The 14th Hussars had a strength of only 450 men, whereas the 7th Hussars, which relieved them, came out with a strength of 600. Therefore, although the space was sufficient for the former regiment, it was not so for the latter. This necessitated the utilizing of the lower storeys, the recreation rooms and gymnasium as dormitories, which was both inconvenient and prejudicial to health. As a remedial measure, tents were pitched during the warm weather and additional latrines erected. New barracks are now, however, being constructed, which will afford space sufficient for requirements. Drainage is effected by means of open masonry drains and is assisted by the natural con- formation of the ground. It is sufficient to carry off storm water if all hollows are filled up, and care taken to secure a slope outwards from the walls. Lavatory and latrine accommodation for the Cavalry have both been deficient; extra latrines are particularly required. The Deputy Surgeon-General reports that the cook-houses have been clean, but require better furniture and more complete cooking implements. The water-supply has been sufficient and its quality good. It is obtained from wells situated well away from all chances of pollution, and carefully covered in. From the wells it is pumped into reservoirs, and thence distributed in iron pipes to all barracks. The water in a few of the wells used by followers and horses of Royal Artillery has been found of indifferent quality. There are three Station hospitals6 The Deputy Surgeon-General reports that the following improvements were carried out during the year:7 Return showing the Admissions and Deaths among the Troops during the several months of the year 1887.

MYSORE DIVISION. 37 Lavatories and Baths. 2 B. Average strength3 GENERAL DISEASES. Group A. Sub-group I4 affecting the effective strength of the force;" and he continues: " throughout the country, prior to its annexation, venereal diseases in both its male and female population were rampant to a repulsive and dangerous degree, and the cancelment of the Contagious Disease Act will ensure their perpetuation. Efforts have been made to induce the loose women to place themselves under medical treatment, but generally without success. This is to be regretted in a country, the women of which, as already stated, are deeply saturated with this disease in one form or another. In fact its extent is so great that the compulsory attendance of those affected would be justified if only as a philanthropic measure by Government to prevent the decline of the natural health of the people, apart even from other considerations. The question viewed from all sides is one of the utmost importance and magnitude, being far-reaching in its effects. It is important to the Burmese as a nation and to the State, inasmuch as the efficiency of our army is being very seriously affected, and our hospitals filled mainly with such cases (most of which are of long duration) at a heavy and unnecessary, or at least avoidable, cost." In 1888 the admissions for primary syphilis were 1,151, for secondary 511, and, for gonorrh5 The Convalescent Depôts of Wellington and Poonamallee show 21 admissions for primary syphilis, a ratio of 50.85 per mille, which in the year before this group of stations gave 34 and 80.38. The Southern district has 30 admissions, an average of 36.67 per thousand of strength against 88 and 100.11 in the preceding year. The Nagpore district returns 26 or 31.10 per mille of strength this year against 6 and 6.41 last year. It will be seen from this that, except in the Lower Burma and Southern districts, the average proportion of admissions for primary syphilis to the strength have largely increased this year.

Officers .12 SANITARY REMARKS. 11. The following remarks give an abstract of matters which received attention during the year:13 roof. The large natural drain or nullah situated between the Infantry barracks and hospital, into which a considerable portion of the surface drainage runs, requires to be cleared out, deepened and, if practicable, made pucka. The Infantry privies, two in number, one at each flank of the barrack buildings, are at a considerable distance (about 250 yards) from the central block. A light privy of corrugated iron, suitably paved and ventilated, might, with great advantage and convenience, be erected near the central rooms. The lavatories in the old barracks are in a dilapidated condition and are urgently in need of repair or reconstruction. The reading-room of the new Infantry barracks is scarcely large enough for the requirements of the troops. The floors in the verandahs of blocks of family quarters are made of clay. Asphalte or concrete is recommended to be substituted. Fort Barracks 14 At Malapuram the Medical Officer in charge states that the Staff Sergeants' quarters are damp and their drainage insufficient. The distribution of the water-supply at Wellington by means of leather buckets and puckally bags is very objectionable, and it is important that zinc buckets be substituted for these. The water up to the points of distribution is pure and whole- some. As this is a sanitarium for invalids and young soldiers, it is recommended that the water should be laid on to cook-houses and barracks in the usual way. The sanitary condition of the Coonoor bazaar is very fair, but the Deputy Surgeon-General represents that it can never be all that is desirable till the water- supply is piped and a system of drainage carried out. Bearing in mind the fact that this is the bazaar to which the young soldier has constant access and from which he obtains various supplies, it is of the first importance that its sanitary condition should be as good as it is possible to make it. The drainage of Wellington is favored by the ground conformation. It would be advisable to have the present masonry drains extended so that their contents could be carried still further away from barracks. Drainage should also be extended to the Coonoor bazaar. Secunderabad District .15 The accommodation here is scarcely sufficient for a battalion of full Indian strength. The comfort of the men would be largely added to if each block were furnished with a certain number of cane-lounging chairs. They are especially needed in the cool of the afternoon during the hot season. The coffee-shops of the Infantry and Artillery were fairly provided, but did not afford that variety in articles of food which so largely contributes to the health of the men. In the coffee-shop of the 7th Hussars every variety of food, such as cheeses, hams, bacons, preserves of all kinds, were procurable, and it was pos- sible at any moment of the day to obtain good and wholesome meat at a very moderate rate. The accommodation generally has been sufficient with the exception of Cavalry barracks where, owing to the strength of the present regiment (600), it has been found necessary to occupy as dormitories the rooms of the lower stories, recreation rooms, gymnasium, &c., and tents. These arrangements have been found indis- pensable pending the erection of the new barracks which are now being built. The meat ration has been found to be very thin and lacking in nutritive qualities; mutton issued usually twice a week and beef five times being grass-fed in a place where even moderately good grass is scarce; neither can ever be possibly good. Green vegetables are very few and insufficient; supplied only about twice a week. Nothing affects more prejudicially the health of troops, especially that of young soldiers, than meat of inferior quality and insufficiency of green vegetables. Deputy Surgeon-General Roberts states that16 Madras District. 17 Reroofing latrines of Royal Artillery guard-room and cells.

Lower Burma District .18 The hospital consists of three wooden structures arranged en echelon; they are raised 12 feet from the ground and are connected with each other by covered ways. The ground floors of two of them are of concrete and contain offices, store- rooms and surgery. They contain 125 beds. Accommodation has been sufficient, but there are no suitable quarters for hospital subordinates, and this want has been much felt. Water has been obtained from the moat. It is conveyed into the moat from the Nanda lake; the lake itself is fed by streams which flow into it from the Shan hills and also by a branch from the Naddya river. The supply is reported to have been sufficient and of good quality. From the moat a channel leads into the palace which, together with wells situated inside the palace enclosure, supplies drinking water to this portion of the cantonment. On a recent analysis the moat water was found to contain an undue amount of organic matter; its use, however, has not been found to produce injurious results. A scheme has been projected for bringing water from its source by means of pipes through filtering beds and, when realised, will be of great advantage. The drainage has been natural. Cuttings have been made when required to carry off storm water which has been found to collect in pools in various directions. Drainage works are now in progress. The conservancy of the Native town is reported as being at a very low ebb, cleansing being chiefly performed by packs of dogs, pigs, and birds. Canteens and coffee-shops have been in existence and supplies in them have been satisfactory. Cooking arrangements have given satisfaction, but the food, consisting chiefly of beef, has been found monotonous. Mutton has been supplied only once or twice a month, as its price has been almost prohibitive, but the sick have been supplied with it twice a week. Bhamo .19 A Buddhist monastery and a wooden shed with a double roof have been used for the accommodation of the sick; the former building accommodated 12 and the latter 20 sick; on the arrival in November of the Hampshire Regiment with a number of sick, another large monastery was occupied. Bernardmyo .20 Cooking arrangements were satisfactory. The water-supply has been abundant and its quality good; it has been boiled and filtered before use. The drainage has been chiefly natural; cuttings have been made wherever required to carry off storm-water. Meiktila. 21 No. 1.

The cost of providing these drains would probably be about two lakhs, and the General Officer Commanding concurs in his opinion that it is doubtful whether such expenditure would have an appreciable effect in reducing the satura- tion of the ground by rainfall. The remarks of the Army Sanitary Commissioner on surface drainage, viz., that drainage for the removal of rainfall must be effected over the surface, while mere surface cuts, except on steep inclines only, afford a more certain means of waterlogging the subsoil, are worthy of consideration; and, with reference to these remarks, the provision of masonry drains to these barracks appears advisable.

BANGALORE DIVISION INCLUDING BELGAUM AND CEDED DISTRICTS. The general health of the troops in the division has been good. The sanitation of the barracks and buildings connected therewith has been satisfactory. In Bangalore the proximity of the Native bazaars to the Parade and Ulsoor barracks is in many respects objectionable, as they are far from being in a proper sanitary condition. The barracks afford ample and well-ventilated accommodation, the inner verandahs of all are occupied as sleeping apartments and are provided with designation boards showing the cubic space which is ample. These verandahs have always been used as dormitories. The urinals attached to the parade barracks are insufficient considering the strength of the battalion now occupying them, and it seems desirable that one should be erected in rear of the library and another on the spare piece of ground between the swimming-bath and the cook-house. The latrines occupy a position on either flank of these barracks and afford sufficient accommodation, but the distance of the central blocks from them is very considerable (363 yards). An additional latrine for the latter would be a great boon and convenience if it were found practicable and not encroaching upon the parade grounds or the main public road. A further extension of the surface drainage of the Infantry and Cavalry barrack grounds on a scale similar to that which has been carried out in the Artillery lines is very necessary. The nullah in rear of the Pensioners' lines and adjacent to the Royal Horse Artillery lines is in an insanitary state. It is recommended to be filled up and a proper drain constructed for about half a mile from the lines. The open nullah between the Pensioners' lines and the South Station Hospital is used as a latrine by the Natives. This objectionable practice is due to imperfect police supervision. The coffee-shops of the Cavalry Regiment are amply provided with almost every description of eatables procured from Europe. Those of the Infantry Regiments were not so well supplied and admit of considerable development. In any health report of Bangalore the drinking-water supply must occupy the foremost place, as it has been for years past the subject of almost continuous consideration. So much has already been said on this subject that it would not serve any useful purpose to dwell upon it further than to say that everything is being done by way of filtration and boiling to render it as fairly potable as possible. It is, however, very important that the distribution of the drinking water here and in all other cantonments should be effected by casks with openings at the top sufficiently large for cleansing, or by zinc buckets in place of puckals and mussacks. An order of Government in the Public Works Department, No. 25 W.,dated 8th January 1889, has approved of the proposal that the drinking-water supply be obtained from sources outside the Bangalore cantonment, and estimates are now being prepared having that object in view. North Station Hospital. 8 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 18TH MARCH 1890, No. 2026. Station Hospital. 9 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 18TH MARCH 1890, No. 2026. cause has been attributed much of the malarial fevers from which the troops have suffered from time to time. That such in all human probability is the case, the experience of other localities similarly circumstanced tend to show. With a view to alleviate the noxious effects produced by the wind blowing over this malarial swamp towards the barracks, the Medical authorities have from time to time recommended that belts of fast-growing trees be planted between the swampy ground and the barracks. This, no doubt, would be attended with very considerable improvement and indeed the planting of trees over the whole cantonment of Secunderabad, especially in the neighbourhood of the European barracks, would add immeasurably to the comfort and appearance of the cantonment which at present is singularly bare and from the perpetual glare very distressing to the eyes. The 2nd British Infantry barracks in South Trimulgherry occupy, en echelon, an extended area on an elevated and sloping piece of ground faultlessly situated were it not so much exposed to the south-west monsoons. Strong draughts of cold and damp air blowing in upon the men especially at night during the monsoon season are certainly very objectionable and are well calculated to be the exciting cause of many diseases. It is very important that steps should be taken to protect the men from these injurious influences. The roofs of the barracks of the 2nd British Infantry Regiment have been in a leaky condition for some time, and have quite recently been the subject of correspondence. The Medical officer in charge, South Station Hospital, reports as follows:10 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 18TH MARCH 1890, No. 2026. Although a good many alterations and improvements have been effected with a view to making it more comfortable and suitable, still it is not, and never could be made, a good hospital. When it is considered that provision has to be made for general diseases as well as lying-in cases, no building short of one specially constructed for the purpose can be satisfactory. In a station of such a size and extent as Secunderabad there should be a station female hospital in a suitable and convenient position fitted up with all modern requirements. The water-supply has been good. The wells from which it is obtained are situated on ground free from impurities. MADRAS DISTRICT. The general health of the troops in this command has been good. Fort St. George, in which the barracks for British troops stationed in Madras are situated, is overcrowded, but the barracks themselves have not been so. The sanitation of the barracks has been well cared for. The Infantry barracks are so placed that they cannot be perfectly ventilated. The ground floors in these barracks should not be occupied by troops for any length of time. The Station Hospital, Madras, is badly situated on account of its proximity to the main road and the river Cooum, the latter containing much sewage matter. As a building, however, with the exception of some minor defects, it meets the requirements. Although piping has been laid down, water has not been supplied to the upper storey. Under the orders of Government a committee recently assembled to report upon a site suitable for a new station hospital at Cupid's Bow. The present hospital contains no quarters for subordinates or hospital attendants. At Poonamallee the barracks consist of four blocks in two parallel ranges. Various improvements have been effected in them from time to time, the latest being the removal of walls enclosing the verandahs and preventing free perfiation of air. The hospital is a large double-storied building well ventilated. There are no quarters for the apothecary in subordinate charge nor for the hospital attendants. The drainage of Poonamallee is fairly good except at the outskirts, where it is indifferent or completely wanting. Difficulty in drainage is inherent owing to the position. To make it effectual great expenditure would have to be incurred. Of St. Thomas' Mount the Senior Medical officer remarks of the north and south barracks that "their nearness to the hill, bad site and faulty construction have ensured their continued disease." The ridge ventilation of some of the latrines is insufficient. Several new drains have been made to carry away surface water, but a more extended system is required. The ventilating apertures of the kitchens are insufficient for the egress of smoke. There are no public quarters for hospital staff and attendants. NAGPORE DISTRICT. This report only deals with the force up to the 1st October 1888, from which date it was transferred from the Madras to the Bombay command. The general health of the troops has been fairly good. The "Old barracks" have been occupied by the Royal Artillery and the "New barracks" by the Middlesex Regiment. No overcrowding has taken place and sanitation has been satis- factorily maintained. There are plenty of trees between the barrack blocks which afford requisite shade. The construction of the garrison prison has been rapidly pushed on. The hospital and sub- sidiary buildings have been kept in good sanitary condition and there has been no overcrowding. Deputy Surgeon-General deFabeck reports that the quality of the bread supplied to the troops has been objected to as being frequently sour, badly baked, and made of inferior flour. The contractor has been fined. The water-supply is described as good and abundant. The following works have been completed during the period under notice:11 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 18TH MARCH 1890, No. 2026. The barracks occupied by the Royal Artillery are of older construction and the site is not so good, but there has been ample accommodation. The Medical officer in charge of station hospital states that the urinals attached to the Infantry barracks are too close to them and cause an unpleasant smell, while they are too far for night use. The hospital has been suited for requirements and its sanitation is described as satis- factory. Drainage has not at any time been considered defective. Open masonry drains run round each barrack block and convey the drainage into iron pipes which carry it a considerable distance down the hill on which the barracks are situated. Water has been supplied from wells and has occasionally run short, necessitating its being drawn from a distance in carts. Surgeon-Major Gormley recommends that the same system which supplies the town with water should be also extended to cantonments and barracks. At Thayetmyo the cells are reported to be damp owing to water lodging in the space below the arches during the rains. At Toungoo no quarters are provided for men of the Army Hospital Native Corps.

The basement flooring of the barracks has been recommended to be laid with concrete as it was found that the fine dust from the existing flooring permeated everything. The hospital is an ordinary full company barrack built of corrugated iron. The main room is 180 feet long, 30 wide and 21 high, affording room for 50 beds. It has been found insuffi- cient for requirements during the unhealthy season, and an unoccupied barrack had to be utilized as an auxiliary hospital. The cook-houses, lavatory and latrines are only temporary bamboo buildings. A perma- nent cook-house has lately been built and is reported to be nearly ready for use. Water has been obtained from wells, as that obtainable from the near side of the river has been found of bad quality from sewage contamination. The supply has been good, the wells being protected from possible contamination. The sanitation of the native town is very bad. A marsh exists outside the stockade which is supposed to be the main cause of the preva- lence of malarial fevers; efforts are now being made to drain it, but probably will be only partially successful. The climate is reported to be pleasant from November to March, but during the rainy season from June to October it is unhealthy, malarial fevers being very prevalent. Shwebo.MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 18TH MARCH 1890, No. 2026. 13 The water-supply has been abundant and its quality good; it has been boiled and filtered before use. The drainage has been chiefly natural. Cuttings have been made wherever required to carry off storm water. Meiktila .14 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 18TH MARCH 1890, N. 2026. I.14 MILITARY DEPARTMENT, 18TH MARCH 1890, No. 2026.
