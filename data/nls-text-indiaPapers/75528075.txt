The Punjab Veterinary College.2 Superintendent, whose staff was increased by the addition of 7 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, 1 Veterinary Assistant, 1st grade, 2 Veterinary Assistants, 2nd grade and 3 Veterinary Assistants, 3rd grade, bringing the total cadre of the sub- ordinate veterinary staff up to 260 : while 12 new veteri- nary hospitals were opened bringing the provincial total up to the figure of 191. Government again records its satisfaction with the increase in the work done by the staff on tour 22,602 villages were visited, 120,502 animals were treated and 107,196 castrations performed during the year as compared with 18,505 villages, 109,390 animals and 58,534 castrations in 1924-25 : while the work done at district hospitals has increased in like measure. 69,000 animals are reported to have died during the year from con- tagious diseases, rinderpest accounting for 52,000. This disease was specially prevalent in the Hissar, Karnal, Rohtak, Gurgaon, Gurdaspur and Kangra Districts, the former suffering very severely. The result was that 232,159 inoculations were performed being an increase of 154,646 on last year, while vaccinations for Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia totalled 147,753. It is to be hoped that the new Research Veterinary Officer will be able to do useful work in connec- tion with these contagious diseases. 5. Steady progress has also been made in cattle breed- ing both in raising the number of approved herd-bulls and in carrying out propaganda among Zamindars to induce them to use good bulls for herd purposes. The contribu- tions of Government to the District Board for the working of the Hariana and Dhanni Cattle Breeding Schemes have also been increased and Government views with satisfaction the good work which is done by these cattle-breeding schemes and by the cattle-breeding societies organized with the assistance of the Co-operative Department. Parti- cularly interesting is the establishment of 3 new societies in the Attock District for the betterment of the cow, and Government will be interested to receive further information regarding the success of this movement in future reports. 6. Government is also glad to find that there has been a noticeable improvement in the general working of the various cattle-breeding grants, especially at the Jahangir- abad and Bahadurnagar Farms. 7. Government congratulates Mr. Quirke on the great progress which has been achieved in his Department and
3 records its appreciation of the work done by him and his staff4 effected in the Punjab. Cattle breeders will also find useful information regarding experiments with various varieties of fodder, while the successful storage of green jowar is an ordinary underground ensilage pit for four years, opens out possibilities, of which many landowners should be able to take advantage. The cordial relations subsisting between the Veterinary and Co-operative Departments in the matter of cattle-breeding and improvement societies and in the distribution of good bulls are indicated in many paragraphs of the reports, and are a source of great satisfaction to Government. A careful perusal of the reports is commended to all who are interested, as the mass of the landowning classes should be, in the valuable work that is being done by the Department in enhancing the great potential source of wealth represented by the live stock owned by the people of the Province. By order of the Governor in Council, C. A. BARRON, Financial Commissioner and Secretary to Government, Punjab, Development Department. 391 FCNote by the Director of Agriculture on the progress in the work of the Veterinary Department. The work of the Veterinary Department falls under three main heads :2 Another interesting feature of the Principal's report is the increase in the number of candidates nominated by Indian States, as it indicates an awakening of the States to the importance of having Veterinary Assistants with a sound knowledge and training in Veterinary science. At the close of the year under review the total number of students in the four years' course for the L. V. P. was 105 against 77 in the previous year. Experiments were carried out by Col. Walker and Mr. Taylor on the control of Foot and Mouth disease, by injections of certain chemicals into the animal system. It is hoped that further work will reveal some means of controlling this disease which is the cause of very heavy loss of farm stock in the Punjab. Work was also carried on by the College staff with a view to discovering a satisfactory treatment of surra in dogs. As regards hospital work, the report shows an increase in every ward; the average total daily attend- ance of patients of the hospital being 93.85 in the year under report, against 83.41 last year. This is an indica- tion of the growing appreciation of the valuable work done at this hospital, and of the popularity of the staff. I again note Colonel Walker's wish that his ap- preciation of the work of the teaching, hospital and clerical staff during the term in which he held office as Principal, might be recorded in generous terms. He has now gone on leave pending retirement and I wish to express my own appreciation of the energy and driving force which he put into his work in the interests of Veter- inary education in the province. (2) District Veterinary Work. The divis on of the province into Veterinary Cir- cles remained as last year, and the post of Chief Superin- tendent was held by Mr. Quirke throughout the year. Among the staff the most important change was the transfer of Mr. Egan, formerly Assistant Superinten- dent, Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, to Rawalpindi, as Superintendent, North Punjab, owing, in the first place to Mr. Brett, Superintendent of that Circle, taking leave3 of that circle throughout the year excepting for a few days of April. Among the Subordinate staff there was an addition of 1 Veterinary Inspector, 7 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and 6 Veterinary Assistants. At the close of the year the complete sanctioned cadre of the Department for district work, including work in district hospitals, was as follows:4 Work done at district hospitals. Number of Year 1924-25. Year 1925-26. Difference in number (+) or (5 The following statement is a summary of the bovine deaths reported from contagious diseases, also of the bovine inoculations and vaccinations performed during the year under report, and in the previous year: The following is a summary of the bovine deaths reported and the bovine inoculations and vaccinations performed in the year under report and in the previous year:6 It will be seen from the foregoing statement that 68,995 bovine deaths were reported from contagious diseases as against 46,310 in the previous year, and that Rinderpest accounted for by far the greater part of this increase. Hissar District suffered most, 5,227 deaths being reported from that district alone. Karnal, Rohtak, Gurgaon, Gurdas- pur and Kangra Districts also suffered severely and nearly all districts suffered to some extent. The Chief Superin- tendent considers that the Jumna floods were a factor in the case in Rohtak District. The Chief Superintendent considers that the very marked increase in the number of fairs throughout the pro- vince must weaken our already uncertain hold on contagious diseases, especially Rinderpest which does not always lend itself to ready methods of detection at fairs. The fact must not be forgotten, however, that if there are few fairs in the province, the tendency is for cattle to travel longer distances to the fairs that are held, thereby carrying the disease to wider areas. The problem of control of epizootic diseases seems to me to be one of finding means for the earliest pos- sible detection of these diseases, and for the prevention of the transport of diseased and suspected animals to other localities. To assist in the control of contagious diseases, Government has sanctioned for the year under report and for the year 1926-27 the grant of Rs. 1,000 per annum for rewards to patwaries and lambardars who promptly report outbreaks. Doubtlessly this line of action will be continued as long as necessary. I have also ordered all district agricultural staff including Agricultural Assistants, Mukaddams and Beldars to help in this work. Another factor tending towards a solution of this problem is the spread of agricul- tural education which is now taking place among the masses. This must bring to farmers a realisation of the importance of prompt isolation of diseased and suspected animals in the interests of the community; the natural result being the creation of a desire for measures to help to reduce the incidence of the disease. The enlightenment of the masses seems to me of first importance in this connection. A great increase in the district Veterinary staff in the next few years is contemplated, and if carried into effect, this, combined with the action of the other agen- cies at work will, I hope, materially change the position as regards control of contagious diseases in this province.
7 It will be seen from the above statement that the number of inoculations for Rinderpest rose from 77,513 in the previous year to 232,159 in the year under report; also there was a considerable increase in the number of inoculations for Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia. Great credit is due to the district Veterinary staff for these achievements. The Chief Superintendent views with concern the steadily increasing demand for serum which has often to be used under the most unfavourable circumstances, and he favours the "Serum Simultaneous" method of inoculation (i. e., the inoculation of serum on one side of the animal and virulent blood on the other) as compared with the "Serum Alone" method. Authorities consider that the former method gives an immunity period of several months while the latter method gives immunity for 2 to 6 weeks, depending on the dose; but the 'Serum Simultaneous" method is said to be attended by more risks. It seems to me that there is a great field for useful research in the Punjab in connection with contagious diseases and I am glad to say that Government has recognis- ed this and has accorded administrative approval to the appointment of a Research Veterinary Officer. As regards contagious diseases among Equines, there were a few additional cases of Glanders this year, and cases of Surra amounted to 210 as against 73 in the previous year. Surra was particularly prevalent in Mianwali, Rohtak, Karnal and Lahore Districts, and in the Bias Bets. Cattle-breeding work was carried on and developed on the lines indicated in the previous year's report. After allowing for casualties among herd-bulls during the year, including the rejection of animals no longer fit for retention on the list, the total number of approved herd-bulls in the province was raised from 1,958 to 2,253. The growing demand for the services of pedigree bulls among poor zamindars is encouraging, and indicative of good results already obtained. These results, together with the very sound agricultural education which an increasing number of the sons of ordinary farmers from all over the province are receiving, and the propaganda work carried out by the several departments concerned, is doing much to convince farmers that it is more profitable to rear a good, than a bad, animal; also to induce farmers to take that in- creasing share in the provision of good bulls for herd pur-
8 poses, which the Chief Superintendent rightly lays stress on as an essential factor in the improvement of cattle in the province. The contribution of Government to the Gurgaon and Rohtak District Boards for the working of the Hariana Cattle-Breeding Scheme was increased from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 8,000 for each District Board, and whereas in pre- vious years each District Board had to contribute an equal amount of money from its own funds, this condition was relaxed in the year under report to the extent that each District Board had only to contribute half the amount contributed by Government. Hissar District now wishes to be included in the scheme, and this proposal has been accepted by Government. For the Dhanni Cattle -Breeding Scheme the Govern- ment grant amounted to a total of Rs. 21,600 and was shared by the District Boards of Attock, Rawalpindi, Mian- wali and Jhelum according to the work done in these dis- tricts. Also Rs. 1,000 were allotted by Government for cattle prizes at fairs, etc. Both of these cattle-breeding schemes are doing very good work and are obtaining increasing support from the local people. Also cattle-breeding societies are being orga- nised with the help of the Co-operative Department. An important innovation in the Dhanni Scheme is the establishment at Lawa, Adhwal and Akwal (Attock District) of three societies, the object of which is to concentrate atten- tion on the betterment of the cow. They are drawn up on the lines of ordinary cattle-breeding societies but contain addi- tional clauses to prevent registered cows being used for plough purposes and to prevent cows being attached in execution of decrees. These societies have been formed largely through the energy and influence of Mr. Garbett, Deputy Commis- sioner, Attock District. It should be noted that a large factor in the success of both of the cattle-breeding schemes above mentioned is the keen personal interest taken in them by Messrs. Brayne, Marsden, Garbett, Ferguson and "Wilson, Deputy Commissioners in the districts concerned. In the general working of the large cattle-breeding grants there has been some improvement; but most of these
9 leave much to be desired. Jahangirabad Farm is giving the best results, and has some fine cattle. Now that a Live Stock Expert has been appointed it is hoped that it will be possible to give these grantees more attention and advice. The small cattle-breeding grants of half to two squares each at Shergarh also have some fine cattle, and milk record- ing societies amongst these have been started by the Co- operative Department. The progress made by the grantees has been good. Endeavours are being made to introduce cattle-breeding on sound principles on the 3 large estates, viz., Dhandla in Bhakhar Tahsil and the Court of Wards estate in Kala Bagh in the Mianwali District and the Kot Fateh Khan estate in the Attock District. The owners of these estates have expressed an interest in the matter. As regards the farming of cross-bred Merino sheep, the wool is greatly superior in quality to that of the country sheep, but as noted last year there is difficulty in securing for breeders its full market value It is hoped that sheep- breeding societies may help to overcome the difficulty by collecting consignments of wool, and sending it to mills in quantities sufficient to obtain full market value. Certain District Boards obtain a large income from cattle fairs, -vide statement IX, pages xxviii10 the province are now rapidly attaining that importance which the position of cattle in farm economy in the Punjab entitles them to attain. During the year under report. Delhi Province Veteri- nary cadre was amalgamated with the Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, on the condition that the Delhi Province administration will pay the expenses of the men employed in that province and the increase in the leave reserve of men required. The control of contagious diseases in the Amritsar Horse-Breeding Area has been transferred to the Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, while the Horse, Mule and Donkey-Breeding in that area has been taken over by the Lahore-Amritsar-Ferozepore Horse, Pony and Mule- Breeding Society. The graphs showing progress of Veterinary work for the past few years which I had originally prepared for the Empire Exhibition in London in 1924 have been brought up to date and again appended to this report; also the map which I had prepared showing all centres of operations of the Civil Veterinary Department has been brought up to date and appended. In the past summer I drew up a five years' programme of development for the Agricultural and Veterinary Depart- ments and since then I have had the opportunity of discussing this with Mr. Emerson, now Secretary, Finance Department and the officers of the departments con- cerned, with helpful results. There seems to be general agreement as to the main lines of development, and it is hoped that large expansions will take place in these departments in the next five years. I feel greatly indebted to the District staff of the Veterinary Department for the good work they have done in the year under report; also to the Co-operative De- partment and District Officers for the very great help they have given. (3) Government Cattle Farm, Hissar. Mr. Branford held charge of the Farm practically throughout the year. Owing to scarcity of officers in the Department he was without an Assistant Superintendent
11 all that time, and this threw an extra burden of work on him and the other members of the staff there. Mr. Branford has since gone on leave and the report for the year has been written by Mr. Read, P. V. S., who is now in joint charge of the Farm, with M. Ghulam Husain, P.V.S. The supply of canal water to the Farm in the year under report was not good, the result being that it was impossible to sow as large an area of Kharif crops as usual; also the yields per acre were much reduced. The rainfall for the year was 12.41 inches, but the intervals between precipitations were too long to grow sufficient grass on the Bir for extensive hay making. Nevertheless the reserve of fodder on the Farm at the end of the year (31st March 1926) was 132,997 maunds as compared with 134,278 maunds at the end of the previous year. The reduction is negligible and the maintenance of this important fodder reserve reflects great credit on the staff. As regards the experiments on the growing of new fodders, the results of further trials of Egyptian Clover or Berseem (Trifolium alexandrium) and Sunflower (Heli- anthus annus) will be awaited with interest. Kikuyu grass (Pennisetum elandestinum is described by Mr. Read as a failure. It gave poor growth and was rapidly crowded out by indigenous grasses where it was not weeded. I have seen Kikuyu grass tried in a good many places in the Punjab and my own impression is that some of the indi- genous grasses will be bard to beat. What is needed to improve our pastures, I think, is a close study of the indi- genous grasses and measures for the encouragement of the growth of the best of them and I am glad to say that Gov- ernment has recently appointed a Fodder Specialist to look into this subject. I am interested to note in Mr. Read's Report that an ordinary under-ground silage pit filled four years ago with green jowar gave clean and fresh silage with little waste. From what I have seen of silage both inside the Punjab, and out of it, 1 feel convinced that the pit method is the one which Punjab farmers ought to adopt wherever spring level is well below the bottom of the silo pit. The pit sys- tem commends itself on account of the cheapness of its construction, the comparatively equable temperature which can be kept, etc. O
12 As regards live stock, it is noted that during the year under report the Farm issued the unprecedented number of 406 bulls to District Boards in the Punjab, and that a number of applications for the purchase of bulls had to be refused; also that 261 female stock were issued through the Civil Veterinary Department to District Boards. Mule-breeding has been stopped but there is still a number of young mules awaiting disposal. These will be disposed of as soon as opportunity occurs. The very large output of animals from the Farm, and the rapidly increasing demand for these reflects great credit on the work of Mr. Brandford and his staff. As already stated steps are being taken to increase the output from this important farm and to provide suitable animals from other sources. As regards contagious disease on the Hissar Farm, the most conspicuous were Rinderpest, and Foot and Mouth disease, which caused the death of 44 and 34 animals, res- pectively. Regarding Foot and Mouth disease, Mr. Branford writes that he has never before seen such a severe attack with so many casualties, and that the disease was of a malignant form which he did not think occurred in India. The Professor of Pathology of the Punjab Veterinary College took a sample of the virus and confirmed the opinion that it was a type of the disease of unusual virulence. The Farm Veterinary hospital treated no less than a daily average of 85 cases, made 461 inoculations against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, 1,734 against Black-quarter and 3,948 against Rinderpest. This is a very creditable performance. On a cattle-breeding farm aiming, as this Farm does, at an increase both in milk production and draught qualities of its animals, the obtaining of milk records throughout com- plete lactation periods is essential. I am therefore glad to note that Government has sanctioned a staff for recording the milk yields of a number of cows. In the year under report the Farm showed a profit of Rs. 57,245 (when concessions to the value of Rs. 1,31,610 given to local bodies and others are included) as against a profit of Rs. 34,935 (when concessions given to local bodies and others to the value of Rs. 93,535 are included) in the
13 previous year. The capital value of buildings, cattle, mach- inery, medicines and dead stock articles on the Farm in the year under report were valued at Rs. 18,74,015 against Rs. 18,21,056 in the year before. This highly satisfactory result is due to a year on the whole not unfavourable for the growth of grass in the Bir and to the highly efficient mangement of the Farm. Mr. Branford and his staff are to be congratulated on an excellent year's work and I am glad to say that in the extensive scheme drawn up for the improvement of Punjab cattle, Mr. Branford has been appointed Live Stock Expert for the province, and consequently that he will, in future, be able to utilise his long experience of cattle- breeding in the Punjab and his knowledge of the needs of Punjab farmers over a very much wider sphere.

14 Annual Report of the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore, for the year 1925-26. Gazetted Staff. COLONES G. K. WALKER held charge throughout the year except for 26 days affixed to the College vacation when Mr. Taylor offi- ciated. Mr. Taylor was on leave from 24th April to 30th June. His assistant, S. Riazul Hassan, acted for him. The remaining officers retained their appointments throughout the year. S. Mool Singh and Mr. Haq Nawaz Khan were confirm- ed on 1st July 1925 and 20th August 1925, respectively. Non-Gazetted Staff. 2. There were no changes of any importance in the es- tablishment of the non-gazetted staff. Admissions. 3. One hundred and fifty-three candidates offered them- selves for admission to the College in June 1925, out of which 31 men were selected after a competitive examination held by the Prin- cipal. One of the candidates held the F. Sc. (Medical group) and the others were Matriculates. Fourteen candidates were nominated by the various Native States, of which one held the F. Sc. (Medical group) qualification and one was a graduate (B. Sc.) of the Mysore University. The remaining were Matriculates. Four F. Scs. (Medical group) were admitted in October. Number of students in the College. 4. At the close of the year under report the number of students was:15 Fifteen men left the College during the year under report, fourteen out of the 1st year class and one out of the 2nd year class. Four left before the annual examinations; eight having failed badly in the annual examinations left the College, three others have dropped out since. Examinations. 5. The annual examinations were held in June and the supplementary examination for stu- dents who failed in one subject in October, with the following results:16 There is a steady increase in every ward of the Hospital in spite of the increasing use of mechanical transport. Special work. 8. Certain experimental work was carried out in the Laboratories and Veterinary Bulletin No. 17 was published by the Punjab Government on the control of Foot and Mouth disease by Chemotherapy. Strenuous efforts were made to try to discover a satis- factory treatment of Surra in dogs, and twelve hounds suffer- ing from the disease were received from the Saharanpur pack. The experiment was not successful, for although the lives of the hounds were prolonged, they all terminated fatally. Much more experimental work will have to be done before an efficient treatment for Surra is evolved. Arrangements to supply certain sera and vaccines to practitioners (medical and veterinary) and to institutions are being considered. There is a strong demand which cannot be dealt with at present owing to lack of sufficient staff for such extra work. During the year 253 post-mortems were performed and 185 pathological specimens were received from various sources and reported upon. Buildings and equipment. 9. Improvements to the Physical and Chemical Labo- ratories were completed during the year. A weigh-bridge for animals has been provided. An X-Ray apparatus has been sanctioned and is expected to be installed shortly. Funds have been provided to build a new Hostel and a house for the Princi- pal during the current financial year. Income. 10. The total amount credited into the Government Treasury during the year was Rs. 23,572-10-9 against Rs. 19,937 last year. The increase is due to the increased revenue derived from the Hospital and from admission fees. It is the highest in the history of the College. Expenditure. 11. The total expenditure was Rs. 1,86,433 against Rs. 1,65,569 last year. The increase is mainly due to the annual increments in the pay of officers and establishment and to initial expendi- ture on necessary equipment and apparatus purchased during the year.
17 Employment of the Alumni of the College. 12. The six diplomates of the English course were given employment in the Punjab Civil Veteri- nary Department. Appointments have been obtained for 12 Veterinary Assist- ants (Urdu course) during the year, but there are still some 90 men on the unemployed list, of which some are pensioners and some unemployable. Since the year to which this report applies however 9 men have been given employment in the Civil Veterinary Department on expansion of establishment. General Remarks. 13. There is steady progress in the popularity of the Institution on both the educational and Hospital sides as shown by the large number of applicants for admission, the increase in the number of patients brought for treatment and the rising revenue. The accommodation and equipment will now bear comparison with any other Institution of its kind in the world and the facilities for instruction are very satisfactory. The Hostel for the students and accommodation for the staff require to be improved, but it is expected that a good deal will be done in this direction during the forthcoming year. These have been delayed hitherto from financial reasons. During the year the health and behaviour of the students residing in the College Hostel were good and an interest has been taken in sports and games. Before handing over charge Colonel Walker expressed a wish that his appreciation of the work of the staff (teaching, hospital and clerical) during the time he has held the office of Principal might be recorded in generous terms. W. TAYLOR, I.V.S., The 8th June 1926. Principal, Veterinary College, Lahore.
18 Report on the Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, for the year 1925-26 by Mr. T. F. Quirke, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Chief Superintendent. Part I.19 with horse, mule and cattle-breeding, the investigation and control of contagious diseases and inspection of veterinary hospitals, etc. 3. Every endavour is made to induce the staff to keep up to date in their professional work, by closely scruti- nising their methods of treatment as given in the hospital records. This system of scrutiny and questioning of the staff on their work is reckoned of very great importance and is being extended as far as possible with our existing organisation. It is undoubtedly having a very desirable effect in raising the efficiency of our District Staff, many of whom have learned to realise that as members of a technical department they cannot give efficient service without a knowledge of their profession. 4. During the course of tours special attention is also given to checking the work done by the subordinate staff in the field. On suitable occasions lectures and demonstra- tions are given to zamindars in connection with the control of contagious diseases, and the improvement of the different breeds of cattle in the province. 5. District Officers and representative zamindars are interviewed whenever possible on the veterinary require- ments of their districts. 6. The Chief Superintendent made regular inspections of all the grantee dairy and cattle-breeding farms in the province, visiting the Sohawa Laboratory and the Govern- ment Cattle Farm, Hissar, as required. He acted as an Examiner in Veterinary Medicine and Meat and Milk Inspection at the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore, for the L. V. P. Examinations. He made an extensive tour of the Dhanni Cattle Tract in company with the Superintendent, North Punjab, he also inspected the veterinary hospitals in the Delhi Pro- vince and many other places outside the Central Punjab Circle during the course of the year. Treatment of Disease. I.20 province and especially in the South-East Punjab Districts. The incidence of this disease seems to follow a definite cycle, the indications pointing to unusual prevalence every three or four years. Statistics of the actual cattle mortality in the province are now being obtained with somewhat greater accuracy than formerly as the result of a more efficient system of checking, made possible by the additions to our District Staff. Examination and Collec- tion of Pathological speci- mens. 8. During the year 357 specimens were received from the subordinate veterinary staff for examination. These were as usual examined in the Laboratories attached to offices at Lahore, Rawalpindi and Ferozepore. (a)21 Other contagious dis- eases.22 Foot and Mouth Disease.-23 Vaccinations against Black-quarter.24 The number of castrations is particularly satisfactory, showing a steady increase on previous years. It is of interest to note here that in the Review of Agricultural Operations in India, 1924-25, the fact was recorded that 195,427 scrub bulls were castrated throughout India, of which as many as 109,432 were done in the Punjab. The volume of the work achieved serves to indicate the importance which the Department attaches to a vigorous castration campaign in dealing with the cattle-breeding situation in the province. III.25 and 5 additional veterinary assistants (including I leave reserve) have been provided for as under:26 Government grant-in-aid. 28. During the year under report grant-in-aid from Government was given to the follow- ing District Boards for the construc- tion of new veterinary dispensaries in rural areas or at places where hired buildings are being used:27 bulls were sent to the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, of which 406 were supplied before the close of the year. The casualties include a certain number of bulls which have died, some that have passed their prime or were unsuitable for further retention on the strength. Details of the total supply of bulls this year are given below:28 It must be regarded as a particularly healthy sign of progress that the sources of supply are being so heavily taxed to meet the increased demand for pedigree bulls in this province that immediate steps are being taken for doubling the output of stud bulls from the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar. There is very definite evidence of a steadily increasing demand for the services of pedigree bulls in the villages. This is especially noticeable amongst the poor zamindars whose resources do not often permit of their purchasing a bull solely for their own use and who have of necessity to rely on the District Board to provide a stud bull for their village. In those villages, however, where a cattle-breeding society has been started it is a comparatively simple matter for the members to subscribe the cost of a bull and be independent of the Board's decision. An increase in the number of such societies towards which a special effort is being made with the help of the Co-operative Department should materially help in the present difficulty of financing schemes for cattle improvement with small Government grants. In last year's Annual Report the difficulties in carry- ing through any general scheme of cattle improvement were freely discussed, particular emphasis being laid on the necessity for providing more liberal funds and an adequate supervising staff. It was with some little satisfaction therefore that the announcement was received during the year of the improved financial position of the Local Government, making it possible to arrange more generous provision in future towards the expansion of the work of the Department. Accordingly proposals for a five years' expansion scheme have been submitted and are now under the consideration of Government. There are reasons to believe therefore that the position has undergone a considerable change for the better and that it will be possible for the Department to tackle the cattle problem in a more hopeful spirit in the future. It is felt, however, that for some little time the Department could profitably employ its newly acquired resources in consolidating its position as undoubtedly it has in the past committed itself to a highly ambitious working programme, considering the facilities with which it was provided.
29 Admittedly with 2,253 District Board bulls at work in the villages we have so far only barely touched the fringe of the cattle problem. This number needs to be increased almost a hundredfold before we can lay any serious claim towards influencing the cattle situation in this vast province. It is clear then that we cannot afford to rely on Government or District Board agency alone for the solution of this problem, the ordinary zamindar and the large land-owner in particular must be taught to bear an increasing share of the responsibility. It is significant that in the present year District Boards have been empowered by Government to make regulations for the improvement of cattle-breeding within their jurisdiction. One cannot help feeling that something more convinc- ing than the passing of model bye-laws by District Boards will be required to deal with the cattle-breeding industry which has hitherto been conducted according to ideas entirely uneconomic. Hariana cattle-breeding scheme. 31. The following Government grants were allotted towards the working of the scheme:30 Thirty bulls bought from the Hissar Farm were dis- tributed in the Hissar District. The proposal to include the Hissar District Board for a Government grant under the scheme has been accepted by Government. The staff required for the effective organisation of a cattle scheme of this kind has not yet been conceded. Meanwhile with the help of the Co-operative Department cattle-breeding societies are being organised, stud bulls distributed and the castration of unsuitable bulls carried out through our ordinary district staff. Dhanni cattle-breeding scheme. 32. The work of the scheme was inspected by His Excellency the Governor on his visit to the Dhanni Tract. Supporters of the scheme greatly appreciate the lively interest taken by him in the revival of their famous Dhanni breed of cattle. They were grateful for the promise received of further financial support from Govern- ment. The area in which the scheme work is centered embraces parts of the four North Punjab districts included in the Dhanni Tract, namely, Attock, Jhelum, Rawalpindi and Mianwali. The scheme received financial support this year from Government in the form of grants as under, conditional on half the amount being contributed by the District Boards concerned:31 The total number of approved bulls enrolled at the end of the year was 187, an increase of 79 bulls, of which 41 have been entered on the subsidy system. This very decided increase in the number of bulls enrolled has been made possible by the generous financial support given this year by Government. It is a matter for regret that no additional supervising staff has yet been provided to deal with the very marked expansion in the work of the scheme. The local staff have, however, responded well to the additional work thrust upon them whilst certain changes have had to be effected in the collection of statistics in order to release the Veterinary Assistants for more important duties. Covering results traced for the year ending March 1925 have given a birth percentage of 68 on 12,219 coverings done by the approved bulls. Six thousand one hundred and forty-three calves were born, includ- ing 3,203 male and 2,940 female calves. This result represents a very satisfactory increase in the number of well bred young stock born in the tract for that year. It gives an indication of the possibilities of a well organised cattle-breeding scheme run on popular lines amongst the poorer zamindars the majority of whom are born cattle- breeders naturally interested in the progress of the work. It is of special satisfaction to the Department that the funds devoted to Dhanni cattle improvement should be entirely spent in the villages of the Dhanni Tract. I have to bring to the notice of Government the names of the following gentlemen whose assistance has contributed to the successful working of the Dhanni cattle-breeding scheme during the year:32 (6) Sayed Mahmud Shah, B.A., LL.B., Hono- rary Secretary, Dhanni Cattle-Breeding Asso- ciation, Rawalpindi. (7) Sardar Jiwan .Singh, Rais, Daultala, district Rawalpindi, (8) Captain Raja Khan, Zaildar, Jatli, district Rawalpindi. Cattle-breeding grants. 33. There has been on the whole quite a noticeable improvement in the general working of these cattle grants during the year. The Jahangirabad Farm has continued to make very satisfactory progress whilst the management of the Bahadur- nagar Farm has considerably improved. The increased demand for stud bulls should provide the necessary incentive to the lessees to arrange more liberal feeding rations for their farm animals in future. Although cattle at present prices may not pay for costly stall feeding it would appear doubtful economy to neglect to provide suitable rations for animals intended for sale. The small cattle grants of ½ to two squares each which were given by Government near village Shergarh in the Montgomery District to encourage the breeding of Mont- gomery cattle have made good progress. Milk-recording societies have been started by the Co-operative Department amongst the grantees, a special staff to supervise their work- ing has been provided. Buffalo Breeding. 34. District Boards also private breeders were urged to provide buffalo bulls at suitable centres and assistance was given by the Department in the selection of animals up to standard for breeding purposes. The need is felt for a buffalo-breeding farm from which suitable pedigree male stock can be easily procured. The castration of inferior male stock is being pushed with vigour. The results of the Department's work have hitherto been most encouraging in those areas where large number of buffaloes are kept for breeding purposes. II.33 mule-breeding to the Army Remount Department remained unchanged. Only the Palwal Tahsil has so far been taken over by the Army Remount Department, this has resulted in the transfer of one Provincial horse and one Provincial donkey to that Department. The above-noted changes in stallion power have reduced the sanctioned scale of non-selected districts to 72 horses and 82 donkey stallions. At the close of the year there were 62 horse and pony stallions as compared with 65 at the close of the pre- vious year. The number of donkey stallions was 79 against 76 last year. At the end of the year the sanctioned scale was there- fore short by 10 horse and 3 donkey stallions. Out of these, 8 horses and 1 donkey are replaceable from District Board funds and will be purchased as soon as money is available in the budget of the District Boards concerned. The remaining 2 horses and 2 donkeys were replaceable by Government. Out of these I horse and 2 donkeys have been purchased since the close of the year and supplied to districts concerned. Services of Stallions.34 IV.35 The department welcomes the steady increase in the number of Co-operative Societies and is specially catering for their requirements. By special arrangement 261 heifers were supplied during the year from the Hissar Farm, the majority of which went to members of Co-operative Societies. Establishment. Numerical Strength.36 to realise the importance of supplying early informa- tion of outbreaks of contagious disease. In time this simple method of recognition for work done is bound to have the desired effect if the funds provided are judiciously distributed. 43. During the year under report the Delhi Province Veterinary Cadre was amalgamated with the Civil Veteri- nary Department, Punjab, on the condition that the Delhi Administration agreed to pay its share of the increased leave reserve required in consequence of the amalga- mation. It has also been decided that any further change in the personnel of the Delhi Province will be arranged for by the Chief Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, Punjab. On the recommendations made by the Chief Commissioner in his note on Veterinary Services in Delhi Province both the Deputy Superintendent and the Veterinary Inspector were withdrawn and the Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department, South Punjab, was placed in immediate charge of the Province. 44. Towards the close of the year the Camel Specialist's Laboratory, Sohawa, which remained under the control of the Chief Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, for the last 3 years was transferred to the control of the Principal, Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore. 45. Consequent upon the withdrawal with effect from 1st March 1926 of the horse, mule and donkey-breeding operations of the Army Remount Department in the Amritsar Area the control of contagious diseases was transferred to the Civil Veterinary Department. The control of breeding operations was taken over by "The Lahore-Amritsar Ferozepore horse, pony and mule-breeding society." 46. During the year under report 3 Veterinary Inspectors and 9 Veterinary Assistants were deputed to Lyallpur and Karnal for training on modern methods of Dairying. Two Veterinary Inspectors and 4 Veterinary Assistants were also detailed for Post Diploma Course of 9 months duration in the Punjab Veterinary College. 47. Proposals for the augmentation and revision of pay of the clerical staff employed in the Department were submitted in August 1925. In view of the steady increase in the activities of the Department since the present cadre
37 was sanctioned, the need of reorganisation of the Civil Veteri- nary Department offices is now urgent. 48. The subordinate staff, both clerical and veterinary, have, with few exceptions, worked conscientiously during the year. The year has been a particularly busy one for the Department, the staff responding well to the extra work thrust upon them. Particular credit is due to the Head Clerks, B. Ram. Rattan and Muhammad Ishaq, for the zeal and energy dis- played by them during a trying year in the management of their particular offices. I have also to record my appreciation of the field work done by the following inspecting staff:38 Annual Report of the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, for the year 1925-26. STAFF. 1.

Carcasses and samples of ewes' milk were sent to the Veterinary College, Lahore, for examination, and on the advice of Mr. Taylor, then Professor of Pathology, the ewes were given an intravenous injection of 25cc Lugol's Solution with noticeable results, statistics of which will be prepared before the next Annual Report. This latter outbreak was great strain on the Veteri- nary staff and all concerned worked with unceasing enthusi- asm. Syed Ghulam Hussain, P. V. S., practically lived in the Sheep Farm during the outbreak, and M. Atta Mohamad Khan, Farm Overseer I, in addition to per- forming his ordinary very considerable routine duties inoculated ewes at an average of 94 per diem, no mean feat. 13. Farm Veterinary Hospital.48 ACCOUNTS. 15. Table XIV showing the main cash results of the year's work will be found in the Appendix. During the year the Farm had to refuse a number of applications for the purchase of bulls (25 of which were required by the Government of the Unitted Povinces) owing to the Punjab demand absorbing all available animals. This goes to prove the popularity of the Hissar Farm bred bull. By refusing these applications the Farm cash receipts are not so large as they might be. GENERAL. 16.

THE note on these Reports of the Director of Agri- culture is so full that it is only necessary to add a few observations. CATTLE BREEDING. (a) Perhaps the most important task before the department and one that may prove of immense potential advantage to the farmer is the improvement of the breed of draught and milch cattle. During the year the Government appointed a Live Stock Expert to devote his whole time to this problem. Good progress has been made in breeding in recent years; nevertheless, as the Chief Superintendent has remarked in paragraph 32 of his report, we have so far only touched the fringe of the cattle-breeding problem in the province as a whole, and the work that lies before the department is one of great magnitude. It has to stimulate the interest of almost all the large landowners, and it has also to supervise and guide the efforts of the few who have interested themselves in the question of cattle breeding. Some of the latter have plenty of enthusiasm, but they still have much to learn, especially in regard to the care and feeding of young stock, the segregation of the sexes and careful selection in mating. For many years to come the large cattle-breeders as well as the small farmers will require constant supervision and guidance from the expert officers of Government if their efforts are to be of any permanent value to the province. The number of selected bulls supplied to district boards during the year was 551 and after deducting casualties (303), which were heavy, the province has now 2,500 selected bulls. Steps are being taken to increase the output of bulls from the Hissar Farm by raising the number of cows to 2,000 and ultimately to 3,000. Both in Hariana and Dhani tracts grants are made for keep- ing approved bulls. Cattle fairs have provided means of demonstrating the advantages of scientific breeding of
2 cattle by exhibiting the best animals on one side and bad and uneconomic on the other. Our ultimate ideal should be to secure that eventually good bulls should be licensed and all other male animals rendered sterile. There is great room for starting cattle-breeding as- sociations, so that a good price may be secured for a good bull, as an incentive to good breeding; the other line is intensive breeding in suitable areas for produc- ing a dual purpose animal, and if this is not possible to produce milk and draught animals in suitable areas. The reservation of two areas of 3,000 acres and another area of 15,000 acres in Nili Bar will help great- ly in improving our breed of cattle. The Ministry wishes to draw the special attention of the Depart- ment to selecting and supplying suitable bulls for the hills, and feels also that sheep-breeding needs greater attention than has hitherto been given. The depart- ment must take up this problem seriously. CATTLE-BREEDING FARM, HISSAR. In spite of the fact that the rainfall in Hissar was nearly two and-a-half times the normal and caused great damage to crops and farm buildings, the farm had a successful year and was able to increase its fodder resources by over 22,000 maunds. As has already been noted, there was an increased demand for stud bulls bred on the farm from many quarters, and the farm succeeded in supplying 354 stud bulls, of which 350 went to district boards in the Province. The abnormal con- ditions caused by excessive rainfall naturally resulted in increased losses from diseases3 In the year 1920 the Veterinary staff consisted of 232 officials and the Province had altogether 145 hospitals. In the year under report, the number of Veterinary hos- pitals reached 219, and the five years' programme pro- vides for the opening of 20 hospitals every year. The number of patients treated reached 673,293 and under a system of visiting villages medicine was supplied to 123,822 animals. The department devoted special attention to the weeding out of scrub bulls and castrated 218,384. There are in British India, 9,022,000 cows, and 1,120,000 bulls and most of these are unfit for breeding purposes. It is calculated that 225,000 selected bulls would be sufficient for requirements of the country and it is gratifying that 65 per cent. of the total castrations of inferior stock in India were carried out in the Punjab alone. The Chief Superintendent and his col- leagues carried out extensive tours and 23,457 villages were visited out of 36,142 villages. (c) The Punjab Veterinary College.4 The Hospital work at the College has again been carried on successfully, the number of patients treated per diem having increased by more than 25 per cent. The average daily attendance has been 119. The Principal now supervises the Sohawa Laboratory for Surra where useful work has been carried on. The Government congratulates the officers of the Veterinary Department on a good year's work. By order of the Governor in Council, W. R. WILSON, Secretary to Government, Punjab, Revenue Department. 275 FCNote by the Director of Agriculture, Punjab, on the work of the Civil Veterinary Department for the year ending 31st March 1927. Mr. D. Milne, C.I.E., I.A.S., held charge of the post of Director of Agriculture, Punjab, throughout the year under report. The work of the Department may be dealt with most conveniently under the three headings:2 At the close of the year under report the total number of students attending the L. V. P. four years' course was 126 as against 105 in the year 1925 and 77 in 1924. Six Veteri- nary Inspectors were selected for the Post-diploma course which qualifies such Inspectors for promotion as Deputy Superintendents in the Provincial Veterinary Service. Six- teen men joined the Farriers' Class. Of these 12 passed and were awarded certificates at the end of the course. The annual examination was held in June 1926 and the supplementary examination in October. The following table shows the percentage of passes in the various classes- in comparison with the passes in the previous two years:3 At present the supply of Graduates from the College is not sufficient to meet the expanding needs in staff of the Civil Veterinary Department. As regards Hospital work, the number of patients treated in the General Ward was slightly more than those treated last year; whilst there was a slight falling off in the number of patients in the Dog Ward. The average daily attendance in all Wards of the Hospital was 119.05 as against 93.85 last year. Funds were provided for a new hostel and a bungalow for the Principal and these buildings are under construction. The Laboratory at Sohawa for Surra investigation work was placed under the Principal, Punjab Veterinary College, in May 1926 for supervision and direction. Bhai Kahan Singh held charge of the Camel Specialist's Laboratory throughout the year under report. It has not been possible so far to obtain a suitably qualified man to take the place of Mr. Cross, formerly Camel Specialist. During the year fly survey operations were resumed. The report shows a year of steady work and useful results. The Public Works Depart- ment have condemned the present Laboratory buildings, and an estimate for rebuilding is under consideration. (b) District Veterinary Work. Mr. Quirke held charge of the office of Chief Superin- tendent throughout the year and Messrs. Egan and Garewal held charge of the Northern and Southern Punjab Veterinary Circles respectively. During the year an important addition to the establish- ment was made in the creation of the post of Live Stock Expert to Government. Mr. Branford, Superintendent, Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, was appointed to the post in November and held charge throughout the remainder of the year in addition to his duties as Superintendent of the Hissar Farm. The superior staff of the Veterinary Department was strengthened further by the appointment during the year of two Superintendents, Messrs. S. M. A. Shah and P. N. Nanda. Both these officers were posted for training under the Chief Superintendent, and since November Mr. Nanda has been undergoing training on the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar. B 2
4 In accordance with the provision of the five years' pro- gramme of development two more Deputy Superintendents for district work were appointed in January 1927. Both these men were recruited by promotion from the cadre of Veterinary Inspectors. These appointments raised the total number of Deputy Superintendents in the province from three to five. No Veterinary Inspectors were appointed during the year as the development programme contemplates the abolition of this class of officers. In pursuance also of the programme sanction was ob- tained during the year for the addition to the district staff of 10 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and 37 Veterinary assis- tants. The sanctioned cadre of the Subordinate Veterinary Service at the end of the year as compared with the previous year is shown below:5 increase of 18.9 per cent. over last year and 99 per cent. over five years ago. The castration of inferior stock continues to gain steadily in popularity. The total number of animals castrated by the staff of the Department both in hospitals and on tour was 218,384, an increase of 19.3 per cent. on last year's figure and 450 per cent. on that of five years ago. The im- portance of eliminating scrub and inferior animals is gaining much ground in the province; and it is noteworthy that during last year 65 per cent. of the total castrations of inferior stock in India were carried out in the Punjab alone. This speaks well for the future of the cattle of the province, and it is to be hoped that in due course the time will come when, as in other advanced countries, all bulls for stud purposes must be licensed and all other male animals must be rendered sterile. The following tables give an index of the extent to which animals have been treated both in hospitals and by the touring staff, apart from the treatment of contagious diseases:6 As stated by the Chief Superintendent the year under report has not been a particularly unhealthy one for the live stock of the province and the mortality reported amongst all classes of animals was considerably less than that dur- ing last year. With the increase which is taking place in the district establishment more prompt attention can be given to outbreaks of diseases when reported. This in turn will, it is hoped, result in a corresponding decrease in the mortality. A sum of Rs. 1,000 was awarded again to Patwaris throughout the province for promptly reporting outbreaks of disease. A sum of Rs. 2,96,000 was provided by Government during the year for the purchase of serum and vaccines. Amongst bovine animals, Rinderpest caused the highest mortality, although the losses due to this disease are little more than half those reported in the previous year. The disease was particularly rife in Rohtak, Gurgaon, Kangra and Sialkot Districts. There is an ever-increasing demand for serum, particularly in the hill districts, and for successful treatment hill cattle require very much larger doses of Rinderpest serum than animals in the plains. It is understood that weight for weight the dose required by a hill animal is eighteen times that required for an animal in the plains. The whole position regarding the treatment of animal disease in the hill tracts is unsatisfactory and must remain so until Hill States co-operate with us in the treatment and control of such disease. The control of the movements of animals within affected areas is essential, and for this the close co-operation of the Hill States is necessary. The "Serum-Alone" method of inoculation continues to be practised. The period of effective immunity granted by this treatment is very short and probably of less than a fort- night's duration. It is said, however, that this period may be, considerably increased if the inoculated animal is placed in contact with animals having Rinderpest. It seems doubtful, however, whether in practice this is always accomplished, and it is probable that although it is necessary to continue this work on a large scale much of the immunity granted in return for the large expenditure incurred is of short duration.
7 The table below gives an indication of the extent to which diseases among bovine animals were treated by the staff during the year:8 The district cattle-breeding work was continued on the same lines as in the previous year. Five hundred and fifty-one bulls were provided to the various District Boards in the province, bringing the number of such bulls at the close of the year to 2,501 as compared with 2,253 at the close of last year. This figure takes into account, 303 casual- ties among bulls during the year. The supply of 551 stud bulls reflects the interest that has been aroused in the public in the improvement of cattle, no less than the activities of the Department to bring about this improvement. With the progress thus being made it has become neces- sary to augment the sources of supply of suitable stud bulls and steps are in progress to increase the output of bulls from the Hissar farm, with a view eventually to doubling the number of bulls now issued by that farm. Provision is being made in the Nili Bar also, and during the year two areas of 3,000 acres each have been provisionally earmarked for cattle-breeding farms to be run departmentally. In addition, 15,000 acres have been set aside for cattle-breeding operations- amongst small peasant grantees. The question of establish- ing a farm for Dhanni cattle breeding in the North Punjab is also under consideration. The Chief Superintendent's remark that although there are now, 2,501 District Board bulls working in villages the fringe of the cattle problem in the Punjab has only yet been touched, is worthy of notice. If the demand is to be met it seems necessary that it should be done from departmental farms as the stock from these is much more popular than that from grantee farms. In connection with the Hariana and Dhanni cattle-breed- ing schemes, grants-in-aid were provided again in the year under report by Government. The total contribution for the former scheme was Rs. 20,000 of which the District Boards of Gurgaon and Rohtak received Rs. 8,000 each whilst the Hissar District Board got Rs. 4,000. These grants-in-aid were conditional on the District Boards concerned spending an equal amount from their own revenues. For the Dhanni cattle-breeding scheme grants-in-aid to the extent of Rs. 22,600 were granted by Government on conditions similar to those of the Hariana scheme. Owing to the fact, however, that two of the District Boards concerned were unable to contribute to the extent demanded, the actual
9 contribution by Government to the scheme amounted to Rs. 18,200. Good work continues to be done under both these schemes and great keenness is being shown. Of the 350 stud bulls supplied by the Hissar farm 100 were purchased by the Gurgaon District alone, bringing the number of approved bulls in that district to 521 which is probably a record for any district in India. Great interest is also being shown by the Rohtak District Board to whom 50 bulls from the Hissar farm were supplied. The cattle-breeding grants m the Lower Bari Doab supplied a total of 44 bulls to District Boards during the year. Bulls from these farms, however, do not appear to be so popular as those from farms run departmentally. Some of the grantee farms possess excellent cattle, but all these farms leave room for considerable improvement. The Live Stock Expert since his appointment has relieved the Chief Superin- tendent of the inspection of these grantee farms and the asso- ciation of this officer with them is certain to lead to better results in the future. The small cattle-breeding grants at Shergarh continue to do good work and regular milk records from over 400 cows are being maintained under the supervision of the Co-opera- tive Department. Sixty-one cross-bred Merino rams from the Hissar farm were supplied to breeders during the year. The Chief Superintendent proposes to increase the supply of these rams for the improvement of the sheep of the Kangra District. The large flocks of sheep in that district give considerable scope for improvement in this line of stock. The part taken by the Co-operative Department in the improvement of the live stock of the province continues to grow and during the year the number of Co-operative Cattle Breeding Societies rose from 39 to 70. The addition of one Cattle Insurance Society and one Sheep Breeding Society brought the total of these at the end of the year to 9 and 6, respectively. The Chief Superintendent has brought to notice the names of certain private gentlemen to whom the Depart- ment is indebted for valuable assistance in the cattle-breeding schemes. Very great help has been given also by District Officers, particularly in those districts where the Hariana and Dhanni cattle-breeding schemes are in progress.
10 (c) Government Cattle Farm, Hissar. Mr. W. S. Read, P. V. S., and Syed Ghulam Hussain, P. V. S., held charge of the farm until the return from leave, on 29th November 1926, of Mr. Branford, Superintendent. On his return Mr. Branford was appointed Live Stock Expert to Government, Punjab, and held charge of the post of Superin- tendent, Government Cattle Farm, in addition to his own duties. He continued in charge during the remainder of the year. Steps are being taken to find a suitable Superin- tendent for the Farm. This is difficult as the farm is of such importance that a man with considerable experience in cattle breeding is absolutely essential, particularly in view of the fact that the stock on the farm is about to be considerably increased. Mr. P. N. Nanda, M. R. C. V. S., joined the farm for duty on 20th November 1926, as officer under training against the vacancy of Assistant Superintendent of the farm. The rainfall on the farm during the year under report was 34.40 inches as against a normal of about 14 inches. In August, particularly, rainfall was excessive and in one day 13.9 inches of rain fell, causing much damage to the crops and buildings. Many farm buildings and walls collapsed, and although there was no loss of animal life the estimated damage to property amounted to Rs. 44,000. The supply of canal water was fair on the whole al- though scanty at certain times of the year. A much better supply than usual was provided by the Sali Minor and in- spite of shortages on certain of the other branches and damage done by the excessive rains the fodder reserve showed an increase and amounted to 155,496 maunds as against 132,997 at the end of the previous year and 134,278 maunds on 31st March 1925. Damage is reported, however, to some of the fodder reserve owing to the floods. The Superintendent reports considerable difficulty in getting sufficient labour for harvesting of crops and other essential operations on the farm, and he considers it necessary to introduce some harvesting or other allowance during the busy season in order to be able to retain labourers at the farm at a time when they can earn more outside. This practice had to be adopted many years ago on certain of the Agricultural Department's experimental farms. During the year under report there was an increased de- mand for stud bulls bred on the farm. In addition to large
11 demands from District Boards in the Punjab there were calls for bulls from Native States and from other provinces in India. The farm succeeded in supplying 354 stud bulls of which 350 went to District Boards in the Punjab. In addi- tion 82 heifers were supplied to zamindars through District Boards, the Civil Veterinary Department and the Co-opera- tive Department. Mule breeding on the farm has been stopped and from the stock awaiting disposal at the end of last year 40 mules have been sold off, mainly to the Army Remount Department. In addition, a few donkeys and a number of sheep have been supplied to District Boards. As Mr. Branford points out the fact that during the last two years 756 stud bulls and 343 heifers have been supplied by the farm, still leaving the demands by District Boards un- satisfied, is a tribute to the popularity of the farm and to the reputation which cattle bred on it possess. From the point of view of contagious disease the farm had a bad year. This was only to be expected under the abnormal conditions which prevailed. The main losses are attributable to Foot and Mouth disease and Hæmor- rhagic Septicæmia. The deaths from the latter disease numbered 35 as against a total of 2 in the preceding eight years. In comparison with 1917-18, also a year of very heavy rainfall, the deaths from this disease, however, were reduced by one half. The losses due to Foot and Mouth disease were heavy amongst sheep and goats. Mr. Branford considers that the losses are light in view of the nature of the year, and that they have been minimised by the system of inoculation and vaccination adopted on the farm since 1918, as well as by measures taken on the farm to control the spread of outbreaks. The total quantity and value of crops on the cultivated area were less during the year under report than last year. This is accounted for by large areas of jowar being destroyed and other larger areas damaged by the excessive rains dur- ing August 1926. In Rabi crops some records were established; 25 maunds of oats per acre being obtained from the Stable farm and a total of 12,000 maunds from an area of 677 acres on all Farms. Considerable success resulted from an experiment with a Madras variety of jowar and a very heavy crop was obtained. The Farm Veterinary Hospital treated daily an average of 122 patients as against 85 in the last year. Inoculations
12 were carried out on a large scale. Two thousand five hundred and eighty-one inoculations against Hæmorrbagic Septicæmia, 2,338 against Black-quarter and 546 against Rinderpest were performed. The old vertical engine purchased second hand in 1900 for supplying power for grain crushing and chaff cutting was replaced during the year by a new steam engine. Two new stack Elevators were also purchased and a Ford 1 ton lorry was provided. This lorry is used for carrying manure to the more distant areas of the farm. By this means it has been possible to manure a considerable area of land at a distance from headquarters. A Boulton Elevaton driven by bullock power was installed on one of the wells and is reported to be easily worked and very efficient. Owing to the great demand for bulls from this farm and to the facilities which it provides for cattle breeding it has been decided to increase activities and to raise the number of cows from 1,500 to 2,000 immediately. With an increased supply of canal water which it is expected to obtain it is intended to bring the cows to a total of 3,000. This will entail bringing a further area under cultivation and will result in doubling the number of stud bulls annually available to the province. Mr. Branford and his staff are to be congratulated on another most successful year's work and on the quality of the stock which the farm is able to supply to the public. The Veterinary Staff of all grades in the various sections of the Department have worked with enthusiasm through- out the year and the aim of all has been to push ahead the work of what is at present a rapidly expanding Department.

Riazul Hassan, assistant to the Professor of Pathology and Bacteriology, carried on the duties of the Professor of Pathology and Bacteriology from 1st October 1926 to 3rd April, 1927, when Mr. J. F. Shirlaw, newly recruited officer from England, took over charge as Pro- fessor of Pathology and Bacteriology, thus relieving him of his additional duties. Non-Gazetted Staff. 2. Sayyed Shamshad Hussain, Demonstrator of Anatomy, retired from Government service after attaining the age of 55 years on 1st July, 1926. The services of Veterinary As- sistant M. Mohammad Sharif Khan were obtained from the Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, to fill the vacancy -with effect from 1st October, 1926. Admission. 3. One hundred and sixty-nine candidates offered themselves for admission to the College in June, 1926, out of which 30 men were selected by the Principal after an interview and an examination. Two of the candidates held
14 the F.Sc. (Medical Group) qualification and the others were matriculates. Thirteen matriculates were nominated by various Native States. Number of Students. 4. At the close of the year under report the number of students was:15 Hospital attendance. 7. The attendance at the Hospital during the year- was:16 Employment of the Alumni of the College. 12. Owing to the five-years' programme of develop- ment of the Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, Punjab, the demand for quali- fied Veterinary Assistants has again increased and the present supply cannot meet it. Proposals to start a two-years' vernacular course at an early date are under the consideration of the Government. General remarks. 13. During the year the health and behaviour of the students residing in the College Hostel were good and the interest in games and sports was on the increase. Principal wishes to record his appreciation of the work of the staff throughout the year. Sohawa Laboratory. 14. The office of Camel Specialist, Sohawa, was in charge of Chaudhri Kahan Singh, throughout the year under report. Seven hundred and two cases of disease other than surra were treated. Eighty-nine camels affected with surra were admitted for treatment at Bhera and Sohawa. Of these 73 were cured, 4 were taken away before completion of treatment and 12 died during treatment. Experiments were carried out to compare the efficacy of Potassium Antimony Tartrate and Sodium Antimony Tartrate. The results showed that Potassium Antimony Tartrate is preferable. Surra in Equines.17 less effective, and is in no way harmful, thereby differing greatly from Tartar Emetic. The injection of this drug during a paroxysm of the disease does not produce any harmful effects. Its disadvantage is its cost. In order to reduce this cost, experiments with a combined treatment with both drugs were made. Of 26 camels treated by this method 22 were cured, one relapsed twenty-five days after completion of the treatment, and 3 died. Of 17 ponies submitted to this treatment 14 were cured. It is interesting to note that amongst the number of camels and ponies cured by this method were several animals, which failed to withstand treatment by Tartar Emetic alone showing that the shock to the system is not so great by this method, enabling more emaciated animals to be cured. Observations are being made to try to discover if it is possible for the bacha to contract infection from the mother during its intra uterine existence. These observa- tions are not yet complete. Experiments have been made to discover if this disease is transmissible through the medium of the mother's milk. Up to the present, the results are negative. Surra transmission experiments with ticks were com- menced some years ago, with the object of ascertaining:18 lying north of the Grand Trunk Road, and comprising most of the districts of Sialkot, Gurdaspur and Gujranwala, has been surveyed. After the close of the fly season parts of Kangra and Hoshiarpur districts were searched in order to find if the tick O. Crossi was prevalent in those areas. Up to the present no such tick was found. Some of the buildings in the laboratory are in bad condition. The menials quarters have been condemned as unsafe. Construction of new buildings is urgently desired. W. TAYLOR, I. V.

19 Report on the Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, for the year 1926-27 by Mr. T. F. Quirke, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Chief Superintendent. PART I.20 in their respective Circles in connection with horse, mule and cattle-breeding, the investigation and control of contagious diseases and inspection of Veterinary dispensaries, etc. As usual, during the course of these tours, District Officers, Mem- bers of District Boards and other prominent zamindars of various districts were interviewed and matters freely discussed relating to the Verterinary requirements of their districts. 3. Propaganda work by means of lectures and demons- trations was carried out at all of the principal cattle fairs. Arrangements were also made for Veterinary exhibits at certain fairs with the object of demonstrating the methods adopted by the Department for the improvement of the cattle- breeding industry in the Province. In these exhibitions, the best and most useful specimens of cattle were shown on one side, and the bad and uneconomic animals on the other side. The advantages and disadvantages of both types of animals were explained to zamindars in as attractive a manner as possible. 4. Every endeavour is made to induce the staff to keep up to date in their professional work by closely scrutinising their methods of treatment, as given in the hospital records. This system of scrutiny and questioning of the staff on their work is reckoned of very great importance and is being ex- tended as far as possible, with our existing organisation. It is undoubtedly having a very desirable effect in raising the efficiency of our district staff, many of whom have learnt to realise that as members of a technical department, they cannot give efficient service without a knowledge of their profession. Whilst every effort is being made, as far as re- sources permit, to raise the standard of efficiency amongst the subordinate staff, it is clearly indicated as the duty of the department to provide for further facilities in the way of regular refresher courses and more specially for the vernacu- lar trained men who form a very large percentage of our staff. These men, not knowing English, cannot take advant- age of professional reference books except those written in the vernacular, which are extremely limited. It will be understood, therefore, that the department is awaiting its opportunity to provide such necessary facilities for its staff, as soon as the Veterinary organization in the Province is strengthened sufficiently to be able to undertake this duty. 5. Since the appointment of a Live-stock Expert for the Province from November last, the Chief Superintendent
21 and the Superintendent, South Punjab Circle, have been relieved of the work of supervising the six grantee dairy and cattle-breeding farms in the lower Bari Doab Canal Colony, which formed part of their duties since these farms were started. It is satisfactory that after the lapse of so many years, a re-distribution of work has at last been effected which will permit of more close departmental supervision over the progress of these farms. 6. The Chief Superintendent acted as an Examiner at the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore, for the L. V. P. exa- minations. He appeared as an official witness before the Royal Commission on Agriculture, giving evidence on matters relating to the Veterinary organisation of the Province. He also visited the Kapurthala State for giving advice in connection with the establishment of a Cattle Breeding Sta- tion in that State. 7. The Chief Superintendent toured in the Hariana and Dhanni cattle breeding tracts to examine the progress made in the work of the Hariana and Dhanni cattle breeding schemes; he also inspected the Veterinary hospitals in the Delhi Pro- vince as well as visiting many other places outside the Cent- ral Punjab Circle during the course of the year. Treatment of Disease. I.22 Examination and collec- tion of pathological speci- mens. 9. During the year 180 specimens were received from the subordinate veterinary staff for examination. These were as usual exa- mined in the laboratories attached to offices at Lahore, Rawalpindi and Ferozepore. (a) Equines. NOTE.23 (b) Bovinies. Rinderpest24 took place in Rohtak and Kangra districts, where alone 173 and 145 animals respectively died of this disease. The necessary preventive measures were, as usual, adopted by the subordinate Veterinary staff. Hæmorrhagic septicæ- mia25 Vaccinations against Black quarter26 II- OTHER DISEASES.

Thus, at the close of the year, there were 219 Veterinary dispensaries in the Province as shown in the map at the end of this report. Administrative approval of Government to the opening of the following 21 new veterinary dispensaries during the current year (1927-28) has since been received:28 15. Lalgarh . . . . District Dera Ghazi Khan. 16. Balkasar . . . . District Jhelum. 17. Domeli . . . . 18. Sangla Hill . . . . District Sheikhupura. 19. Karkan . . . . 20. Bhogpur . . . . District Jullundur. 21. Sheikh Fazal . . . . Nili Bar Area. Out of these, the dispensaries at Balkasar, Domeli (Dis- trict Jhelum) and Bhogpur (District Jullundur) were opened during the year under report in lieu of the new dispensaries at Khunda, Taman (District Attock) and Sehjara (District Lahore) which will be opened during the current year. Government has also approved of the appointment of additional staff mentioned below for the above dispensaries as well as for special breeding tracts and for low-lying areas:29 One lakh, four thousand, two hundred and nineteen castrations were performed in these dispenasaries aganist 75,802 during the previous year. It is satisfactory to note the steady improvement in the attendance figures of our Veterinary Hospitals. Building of Veterinary dispensaries. 29. Many dispensaries are still located in unsuitable, temporary or hired buildings. The District Boards concerned are being induced to provide buildings on the lines of the approved standard plans as soon as possible. It is hoped that with the help of the Government grant-in- aid for the construction of new Veterinary dispensaries, suit- able buildings will be provided at many of these places in the course of the next few years. Government grant-in-aid. 30. Of the 6 District Boards to which grant-in-aid was given in 1925-26 (vide detail in paragraph 28 of last year's report) only 2 District Boards, i.e., Jhelum and Mianwali have spent the allotment in full, the remaining 4 District Boards having delayed their building projects for one reason or an- other. It is hoped that the above grants as also the grants given during the year under report will be utilised on the construction of Veterinary buildings as soon as possible. The following shows a detail of the Government grant-in-aid given during the year under report:30 Simla Veterinary dispensary. 31. The receipts and expenditure of the Simla Veterinary dispensary during the year under re- port were Rs. 13,274 and Rs. 9,637, respectively, against Rs. 12,389 and Rs. 6,980 during the previous year. The income and ex- penditure of the dispensary during the year under report show an increase of Rs. 885 and Rs. 2,657, respectively, over the previous year. The surplus of the income over expenditure which must have been credited to Government Treasury by the Municipal Committee was Rs. 3,637 against Rs. 5,409 last year. This decrease is due to heavy increase in expenditure on buildings during the year under report. Breeding Operations. I.31 18 bulls of the Montgomery breed purchased by the District Boards of Jhang and Multan. 12 bulls of the Bhagnari breed purchased by the District Board of Dera Ghazi Khan. 10 bulls of the Thar-Parkar breed purchased by the District Board of Ambala. 5 pahari (Suket) bulls purchased by the District Board of Kangra. 5 local bulls purchased by the District Board of Ludhiana. 1 other Hissar bull supplied to Lyallpur Dtistrict Board. Indents of the following districts could not be complied with in full or in part on account of the shortage of suitable bulls:32 villages, we have so far only barely touched the fringe of the cattle problem in this vast province. Under the present conditions of the cattle breeding industry it would seem that the people are relying entirely on Government to provide high class stud bulls for the villages through its established farms and that the majority of the large land-owners are not showing the slightest interest in the subject of cattle improve- ment. It is most unlikely that the Government farms will be able to meet the demands of the entire Province for stud bulls which would be required under a properly organised cattle improvement scheme so that the arrangement which commends itself for the future is to concentrate as large a percentage as possible of the yearly output of farm bred stud bulls in the cattle-breeding tracts and meet the demands of the remaining districts by village produce got by these bulls. Cattle-breeding in the tracts badly needs the en- couragement which a demand for the best male stock for breeding purposes is likely to give rise to, because of the relatively higher prices which such stock should fetch, com- pared to working bullocks. It is suggested that the back- wardness of the cattle industry is in so small measure due to the complete absence of any special demand at fancy prices for well bred cattle for breeding purposes. It is this incentive of securing fancy prices for horses suited for special purposes that maintains the keenness of the horse-breeder and some such stimulus is badly needed in the cattle industry. It is strongly urged that the cattle-breeding tracts should be treated as selected districts for cattle-breeding work and a special organisation provided comparable with the existing Army Remount Department organisation for horse breeding in the Province. Hariana Cattle Breed ing Scheme. 33. The following Government grants were allotted Hariana Cattle Breed. towards the working of the scheme : 33 These grants were given on the condition that an equal amount would be contributed by these District Boards towards the expense of the scheme. One hundred stud bulls were supplied to the Gurgaon District from the Hissar Farm during the year, bringing the total number of approved bulls now working in that district to 521. An indent for 12 more bulls was also received from the district, but it was decided that the Departments" local staff was altogether inadequate to assume responsibility for any further increase in the number of stud bulls under their supervision. Rohtak District Board purchased 52 bulls from the Hissar Farm and 30 male calves for rearing locally which were distributed to approved breeders. This is one of the most important cattle-breeding districts in the Province. Excellent results may be expected from any well organised cattle improvement scheme supported by sufficient funds for financing prize distribution amongst zamindars rearing good stock in their villages. The difficulty hitherto has been that the District Board Members cannot agree amongst themselves as to how the best use can be made of the limited funds provided, whilst the Department is not in a position to run a cattle improvement scheme in the District without the financial assistance of the Board. The Hissar District Board spent rupees ten thousand during the year for the purchase of bulls from the Hissar Farm, this includes the Government grant of Rs. 4,000. The total number of approved bulls working in the Hissar District is 144. This district can be relied upon to give very encouraging results from any large scale distribu- tion of bulls in the villages combined with a scheme of prize distribution to zamindars maintaining well bred cattle. The funds hitherto available have not been sufficient to enable the Department to carry out any regular system of replacing old or otherwise unsuitable bulls on the strength. It is felt that a scheme which cannot provide continuity in the supply of approved bulls to particular villages loses much of its value. Even with limited funds it would still be possible to provide for this if District Board members D
34 would agree to a system of concentrating District Board bulls in a small area of their district. Dhanni Cattle Breeding Scheme. 34. The work of the scheme was inspected in October last by His Excellency the Viceroy on his visit to the Dhanni Tract. A re- presentative collection of well bred Dhanni cattle were paraded for his inspection at the Sohawa Laboratory. To commemorate the visit a private supporter of the scheme, Lala Bishen Das kindly offered a valuable silver cup for competition which was presented on that day by His Excellency to the owner of the best stud bull enrolled under the scheme. The following Government grants were allotted towards the working of the scheme :35 very satisfactory increase in the number of well-bred young stock born in the tract for that year. It gives an indication of the possibilities of a well organised cattle-breeding scheme run on popular lines amongst the poorer zamin- dars the majority of whom are born cattle-breeders natur- ally interested in the work of the scheme. Arrangements are in progress for the holding of a special Dhanni cattle show during next cold weather at Gujar Khan, District Rawalpindi, where the best specimens of the Dhanni breed from the different districts will compete for substan- tial prizes. Government assistance has been sought to make it an annual Provincial show. I have to bring to the notice of Government the names of the following gentlemen whose assistance has contributed to the successful working of the Dhanni cattle-breeding scheme during the year :36 Department in the selection of animals up to standard for breeding purposes. The need is felt for a buffalo breeding farm from which suitable pedigree male stock can be obtained to meet the requirements of the districts. II.37 compared with 58 rams and 1 ewe during the previous year. These were issued to the following districts :38 It is hoped that an increase of these Societies will make it easier for the department to pursue cattle improvement schemes with small Government grants. The experience gained, however, up-to-date shows that the funds of these comparatively new societies are extremely limited and that the Members still regard it as the duty of the District Boards to provide bulls for their benefit in the villages. Establishment. Numerical strength39 General remarks. General remarks. 43. Like last year, a grant of Rs. 1,000 was again sanctioned by Government for rewards to Patwaris and Lambardars as a sti- mulus for prompt reporting of contagious diseases. The con- ditions laid down for the distribution of this grant only admit of comparatively small rewards being given which experience shows are not sufficiently attractive to induce keenness. 44. As a result of the proposals submitted in August 1925, only 4 clerks were added to the clerical staff of this department with effect from 1st April 1927. This addition is quite insufficient under the present conditions when the department is expanding in all its branches on account of the 5 years' programme of expansion. Fresh proposals for the augmentation of the clerical staff and the revision of the grade of certain members of the existing staff have therefore been submitted to the proper quarters. The urgency of the re-organisation of the Civil Veteri- nary Department offices has already been noted in the previous year's report. It is desired that immediate steps should be taken in this direction. 45. As in former years, the subordinate staff, both Veterinary and Clerical, with few exceptions, have continued to work satisfactorily during the year inspite of abnormal increase in their responsibilities. M. Talib Khan, Deputy Superintendent, North Punjab, whose enthusiasm and success in extending the Dhanni cattle-breeding scheme have been recognised by the grant of the title of Khan Sahib also the other Deputy Superinten- dents deserve praise for the manner in which they have dis- charged their duties during the year. The Chief Superintendent also records his appreciation of the field work done by the following Veterinary Inspec- tors :40 Superintendents, North and South Punjab, for the zeal and energy shown in the conduct of the work. The assistance received from District Officers is gratefully acknowledged. T. F. QUIRKE, Chief Supdt., Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, Lahore. The 16th July 1927.
41 Annual Report of the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, for the year 1926-27. Staff. 1. Farm was in joint charge of Mr. W. S. Read, P.V.S., and Syed Ghulam Hussain, P.V.S., from 1st April to 29th November 1926, in addition to their own duties. 2. Mr. R. Branford, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., returned from leave on 29th November 1926, relieving the above officers of the additional charge. 3. Mr. Muhammad Jan, P.V.S., reported to the Farm for duty as a Deputy Superintendent on 24th December 1926, relieving Syed Ghulam Hussain, transferred. 4. Mr. R. Branford, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., was appointed Live Stock Expert to Government, Punjab, from the date of his return from leave, and continued to hold charge of the duties of Superintendent, Government Cattle Farm, in ad- dition. 5. Mr. P. N. Nanda, M.R.C.V.S., Officer under training, Civil Veterinary Department, was sent to the Farm by Chief Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, from 25th August to 2nd September to assist with control of contagious diseases after the floods. 6. Mr. P. N. Nanda, M.R.C.V.S., reported for duty at the Farm as Officer under training on 20th November 1926. 7. The post of Assistant Superintendent was vacant throughout the year. II.42 in some places as deep as 5 feet. The lower half of the Mundianwala cultivation block was under water for three weeks. Luckily those fields were fallow except for an acre or two of Lucerne. Many Farm buildings and walls collapsed, the total damage being estimated at Rs. 44,000. There was no loss of animal life due to the flood. Temperatures were below normal all the cold weather. Irrigation. 4. Canal water all through the year was generally sufficient, though occasionally scarce which checked growth of crops especially in late July and early August. The supply in the Dabra minor was often scanty and gave cause for anxie- ty for the crops at Chaoni. The Sali minor which has usually been mentioned with the Dabra minor as short of water has this year done very well, due to the discovery that the channel dimensions were incorrect. This defect was corrected and the best supply seen in that water-course for many years has been the result. Labour. 5. Difficulty was experienced in getting sufficient labour during the year. In April and May men were scarce due to the severe plague epidemic, many of them left and went to their villages as owing to the evacuation of Hissar and closing of shops and the Mundi, food was dear and difficult to get. The good rains as usual caused great activity in barani villages, high rates of wages were being paid, too tempting for the Farm labour to resist and during the autumn har- vesting Juar and ploughing for Rabi was brought almost to a standstill. A scheme to authorise a harvest or monsoon allowance similar to that in vogue at the Lyallpur Farm, to be brought into operation at the discretion of the Superin- tendent of the Farm in times of severe labour competition, and a scheme to pay permanent labour on increased scale after a period of unbroken service have been put up to the Director of Agriculture. Malaria was very prevalent after heavy rains in August and added to labour troubles in the autumn. IV.43 Unfortunately some of the older stacks received some damage by flood. The amount of the damage cannot be exactly estimated until the stacks are opened for issue. But there is no doubt the fodder situation, good though it un- doubtedly really is, is not quite so good as the books indicate. V.44 (c) Arab Stock. 11. Arab Colts45 and all to the good of the Punjab, but it is not business from the commercial point of view and that fact should be remem- bered if it is found that Farm expenditure exceeds cash receipts. The staff necessary to keep milk records from a small percentage of Farm cows were appointed from 1st April 1926. During the year they have settled down to the work, and the results on the whole are very encouraging. Twelve cows yielding over 4,000 lbs. during the year. and many more over 3,000 lbs. I have referred to this in more detail in a note on Hariana's cattle written for " The Journal of the Central Bureau for Animal Husbandry and Dairying in India." Donkeys. 15. As a stud continue on the up grade so far as size and conformation are concerned but we continue to receive complaints after the animals are issued that they are slow coverers. As no jacks have been issued from this Farm in recent years until after they have successfully covered several mares, I think the fault must lie largely with the Dis- trict Board Syces. I think a school for training District Board Syces will have to be opened on the Farm. With the object of introducing fresh blood and also a strain known to readily cover pony mares, a 4 years old American Jack has recently been purchased for the Farm through the Army Remount Depôt. Sheep. 16. Sheep suffered very severely from the very unusually virulent outbreak of foot and mouth disease mentioned in last year's report. The flock, however, continue to yield profit to the Farm. Demand for stud rams shows no tendency to increase in the Punjab. Much more interest is being shown in sheep by surrounding states. The prices received for wool remain fairly constant and compare well with prices in England. Arab Horses. 17. Four stallions were issued during the year. Two were of exceptionally good quality. Owing to the demand for stud bulls having increased beyond the capacity of this farm to supply Government have been considering the question of increasing output.
46 Sanction was received during the year to increase the herd of cows from 1,500 to 2,000 and a further increase to 3,000 is contemplated. The latter figure involves the eventually doublings of our output of stud bulls. VI. CONTAGIOUS DISEASE. 18. As usual in wet years contagious diseases were much more prevalent than usual. Losses however considering the conditions, were, except from foot and mouth disease very light Hæmorrhagic septicæmia being the only other disease from which the number of deaths were more than normal. The only year which can be fairly compared with 1926- 27 from the point of view of climatic conditions is 1917- 18. The rainfall being as follows :47 As regards Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and our policy of vaccination mentioned above. The statement of losses due to this disease before I started vaccination and after are given below and are of interest48 The following deaths from contagious diseases oc- curred :49 More Jowar hay (Kurby) would have been saved except for the August floods. Considerable areas were destroyed and larger areas damaged. Oats sown in the autumn of 1926, germinated well, and did well on the whole except that growth was slower than usual owing to unusual cold. The yield from stables Farm 125 acres was 25 maunds per acre, a record for this Farm. The yield would have been heavier, but for large pro- portion of the crop having lodged (partly due to storms and partly from our own fault to over manuring). The yield from Chaoni Farm 100 acres was 23 maunds per acre. The yield from Salli Farm 116 acres was 20 maunds per acre. The yield from all Farms 677 acres amounted to over 12,000 maunds, a record for the Farm. The following items which come more or less under the head experiments are of interest:50 of raising water is very cheap, as only one boy is required to drive the bullocks. This method of raising water can be safely recommended where water is required for small gardens or for cattle drinking purposes. 19 (d) Formalin as a preventative of smut :51 Number of other animals castrated .. 7 Inoculations performed against Hæmorrhagic Septi- cæmia .. .. .. 2,581 Inoculations performed against Black Quarter .. 2,338 Inoculations performed against Rinderpest .. 546 Inoculations performed against Contagious abortion 17 X.52 successor Mr. Muhammad Jan is rapidly learning the work and shows every promise of being a valuable acquisition to the Farm. The F. O. II Mr. Ata Muhammad has as usual distinguish- ed himself by hard work throughout the year. The Head Clerk of the office Lala Piyare Lal, retired on 19th January 1927, after 33 years' service in the Civil Veteri- nary Department. Lala Piyare Lal had been Head Clerk of the Farm office since 1st July 1899. He was always painstaking, trustworthy and reliable, and will be much missed. He has been succeeded by the Accountant Lala Piyare Lal, Gupta, who thoroughly deserves promotion. XII.[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] WATER LIFTER.

53 Annual Report of Live Stock Expert, 1926-27. I. As instructed on my return from leave on 29th November 1926, I took over charge of the newly created office of Live Stock Expert, in addition to my duties as Superintendent and Assistant Superintendent, Government Cattle Farm, Hissar. Naturally I was unable to devote much attention to the new post. I did, however, manage to tour for 35 days and in the course of my tours inspected :54 Name of Farm. Area in acres. Head bulls. Cows.

Live stock improvement.3 by selection and then, when the indigenous flock has been built up, securing its improvement by judicious crossing. Work on these lines should be taken in hand at places where conditions for success are promising. 3. Milk supply .4 the Ministry agrees that earlier action in this direc- tion and more prompt replacement of bulls are essential to success in cattle breeding. No less essential is the careful allotment of approved bulls when issued to suitable localities. Full advantage can only be taken of the system of issuing such bulls if district boards will agree to be guided by their veterinary advisers in the choice of suitable villages for the creation of a stock of good cattle and will allot the bulls purchased from the Hissar Farm or elsewhere to those villages only. As matters stand at present, many boards purchase a few bulls which are unsystematically scattered over the district. The result is that for all practical purposes many of them are wasted. If they were confined to selected villages, all other unsuitable bulls in which were castrated, a few years would see the creation of a fine breed of cattle from which other parts of the district could be supplied to the general improve- ment of the breed of cattle throughout the surrounding country. The resources of the Hissar Farm, which is the main source of supply for approved bulls, are being expanded, but are still and always must be limited, and at present except in the districts of Rohtak and Gurgaon which have taken sufficient balls to effect a general improvement in the stock, their resources are not being used to the best advantage. If a policy of concentra- tion, as outlined above, were adopted, the Ministry is confident that there would be a much more rapid general improvement in the cattle of the Province. Bulls would be cast at the proper time, because the Zamindars would know that they could be at once re- placed. The good done by the magnificent animals from Hissar would not be negatived by the presence of innumerable scrub bulls, and the production of animals suitable for breeding would thus steadily in- crease until it would become possible to insist upon the castration of all but approved animals, as is done in every other progressive cattle-breeding, country. 5. Hissar Farm.5 Punjab it is hoped that the Province will still occasion- ally have the benefit of his unique experience as a cattle breeder. The Ministry notes with interest the efforts that have been made to improve the milking qualities of the farm herd. Fodder cultivation was extremely success- ful, and the efficiency with which it is carried out on the farm should provide a valuable example to neighbour- ing farmers; but the failure of the local peasant to adopt ensilage, though perfectly well acquainted with its advantages and with the methods of making and storing it, is disappointing. Other distircts have been quick to realise its possibilities. 6. Veterinary work.6 7. Punjab Veterinary College.7 requires skilled hands, and it has not yet been found possible to give the officers of the department the neces- sary training at Muktesar. It is hoped that a start will be made next year, as in the absence of any legis- lation for the control of contagious diseases and owing to the apathy and ignorance which militate against the adoption of' simple and necessary safeguards, serum inoculation, which only confers immunity for nine of ten days, must always be expensive and unsatisfactory. The Chief Superintendent has expressed his disappointment at the fact that the co-operative societies of the Province, which number 470 thousand members, most of whom are agriculturists have so far done little towards the pro- pagation of certain simple rules and precautionary measures which would to a great extent safeguard their village from the destructive visitation of cattle disease. The Ministry agrees that much more could be done in this direction, and hope that the officers of the Veterinary and Co-operative Departments will give their joint attention to this question. So much social and financial improvement has been achieved by co-operative societies that it seems certain that if given the necessary stimulus they could render valuable assistance in this matter. The Chief Superintendent has remarked that owing to the spread of water-logging hæmorrhagic septicæmia is on the increase, and is second only in destructiveness to rinderpest. The connection between this disease and marshy water-logged areas is one which deserves further investigation, and it may be necessary to undertake special measures, for combating it in badly drained areas, which are also the home of surra and of a variety of para- sitic diseases. 9. The Ministry wishes to record its appreciation of the excellent work done by Mr. Quirke, the Chief Superin- tendent, and the officers of the department through- out a year of unusual expansion and considers that in the circumstance of acute shortage of staff the progress made has been most creditable. By order of the Punjab Government. JOGENDRA SINGH, W. R. WILSON, Minister for Agriculture. Secretary to Govt., Pb., Revenue Department. 286 FCAnnual Report of the Punjab Veterinary College for the year 1927-28. Gazetted Staff. THE charge of the institution remained with Mr. Taylor throughout the year, except for from 6th May 1927 to 2nd July 1927, when he was on leave out of India prefixed to college vacations, commencing on 3rd July 1927. Captain Walker officiated for him during this period. Lala Durga Das worked as Professor of Medi- cine in addition to his own duties from 6th May 1927 to 2nd July 1927. Mr. J. F. Shirlaw joined his appointment as Professor of Pathology in the forenoon of 3rd of April 1927. He pro- ceeded on Medical leave on 6th May 1927 to 2nd July 1927, and Syed Riazul Hassan carried on the duties of the Pro- fessor of Pathology in addition to his own duties. Non-gazetted Staff. There had been no change in the non-gazetted establish- ment during the year. Admissions. One hundred and thirty-four candidates offered them- selves for admission to the College in June 1927, out of which 31 were selected by the Principal. Nine Matriculated candidates were nomi- nated by various Indian States. Six candidates with F.Sc. Medical group qualification were admitted to the 2nd Year Class in October 1927 by the Principal and one with similar qualification was nominated by the Hyderabad (Deccan) State. -Number of Students. At the close of the year under report the number of students was :2 in October 1927 with the following results :3 The number of animals experimentally treated has ne- cessarily been small, but the results have been sufficiently encouraging to warrant further sustained investigation. Poultry Diseases. Investigations have been carried out in a disease of poultry, which appears widely prevalent in the Punjab. Numerous outbreaks, attend- ed with heavy losses, have been reported. A considerable amount of work in the disease has been done at the Punjab Veterinary College, and important data collected : investiga- tion has been concentrated in the nature of the casual virus method of spread, and the essential pathology of the disease. A wide range of therapeutic agents has been employed in experimental treatment. The results up to the present warrant further investigation. Buildings. The new Hostel, Tube Well and the Principal's Bungalow were completed during the year. Income. The total amount credited into the Government Treasury during the year was Rs. 27,652-2-11 against Rs. 27,158-10-9 last year, the increase is due to the enhanced rate of hostel fee. Expenditure. The total cost was Rs. 1,58,086 against Rs. 1,61,157 last year. The decrease is due to Mr. Taylor's pay being drawn in England while on leave. Employment of the Alumni of the College. The demand for qualified men is much more than the supply. To improve conditions and ultimately the supply of qualified candidates the local Government has sanctioned the standard of admission to this College to be raised to the inter- mediate in Science or Arts Faculty. For the first two years, however, any vacancies can be filled up by Matriculates of the 1st Division only. General Remarks. During the year the health and behaviour of the students residing in the College hostel, were good. Games and sports, however, could not be satisfactorily undertaken on account of the inability to ob- tain water for the playing field. It is hoped that this draw- back will be overcome in the near future. The Principal wishes to record his appreciation of the work of the staff throughout the year.
4 Sohawa Laboratory. Chaudhri Kahan Singh remained in charge of the office of the Camel Specialist, Sohawa, throughout the year under report. Nine hundred and three animals belonging to private owners were treated for various diseases during the year. Surra in Camels.5 The residential quarters of the superior and inferior staff, the office and the Laboratory blocks have been condemned as un- safe for habitation. Plans for remodelling the Laboratory are under the consideration of Government. The total expenditure incurred in running the Sohawa Laboratory during 1927-28 was Rs. 34,702. W.

6 Report on the Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, for the year 1927-28, by Mr. T. F. Quirke, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Chief Superintendent. PART I.7 2. The Chief Superintendent, Superintendents and Deputy Superintendents toured in their respective circles in connection with horse, mule and cattle-breeding, the investigation and control of contagious diseases and inspec- tion of Veterinary Dispensaries. As usual, during the course of these tours, District Officers, Members of District Boards and other prominent zamindars were interviewed and matters relating to the Veterinary requirements of their districts freely discussed with them. 3. Propaganda work is being pursued with vigour in conjunction with the officers of the Co-operative Department, who gladly provide the opportunity for our district staff to address co-operative meetings on veterinary topics. 4. The Department readily accepted the invitation to take part in the Demonstration Train which toured the Pro- vince during the past cold weather months. A complete veterinary car was fitted up, of which full advantage was taken, to demonstrate, by means of simple interesting exhibits, the work being done for the improvement of the Live Stock of the Province. The National Horse Breeding and Show Society of India collaborated in the Horse Breeding Section. The Cattle Breeding propaganda films so kindly lent for use on this tour by the Imperial Dairy Expert were particularly appre- ciated by zamindars. Demonstration by means of magic lantern slides illustrating diseases of animals was a regular feature of the propaganda work done in the course of the train's tour and it proved extremely popular. Leaflets on cattle disease were also distributed extensively during the tour. 5. The Chief Superintendent acted as an Examiner at the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore, for the L. V. P. Ex- amination. He attended as an official delegate the seventh Congress of the Far-Eastern Association of Tropical Medicine held at Calcutta in December 1927. 6. The Chief Superintendent toured in the Hariana and Dhanni Cattle Breeding tracts to examine the progress of the work done there. He also visited the grantee farms in the Lower Bari Doab canal colony, the Government cattle farm, Hissar, and many other places outside the central Punjab circle during the course of the year.
8 PART II.9 By arrangement with the Principal, Punjab Veterinary College, additional centres for the treatment of this disease are being opened during the Surra season under Veterinary Assistants specially trained for this work. A note on the progress of the work done in the treatment of the disease at these centres will be found in the report of the Sohawa. Laboratory. As the result of recent research work done by the Direc- tor, Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, very noted progress has been made in the Chemotherapy of Surra of horses and cattle, which is likely to have far reaching results in this Province. Dourine 10 211,295 inoculations in the previous year. One hundred and fifty seven animals died after inoculation, which were probably in the incubative stage of the disease at the time of inoculation. The demand for serum inoculations in the face of out- breaks of rinderpest is so great that the department has difficulty in satisfying it owing to the heavy expense entailed. Recent research work by the Director, Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, has greatly simplified the carrying out of the serum simultaneous method of inocula- tion as a routine measure in the field and arrangements are now in progress for adopting this method which gives a more durable immunity.

Thus at the close of the year there were 241 veterinary dispensaries in the province, as shown in the map at the end of this report. Government has also sanctioned the appointment of the additional staff mentioned below for the opening of 17 dis- pensaries during the year 1928-29 in special breeding tracts and low lying areas:14 into constant touch with a larger number of villages in his charge. Building of Veterinary dispensaries. 28. Many dispensaries are still located in unsuitable, temporary or hired buildings. The dis- trict boards concerned are being induced to provide buildings on the lines of the approved standard plans according as funds are available. It is hoped with the help of the Government grant-in- aid for the construction of new veterinary dispensaries that suitable buildings will be provided at many of these places in the course of the next few years. Government grant-in- aid. 29. Steps have been taken to impress upon district boards concerned the importance of utilising without unnecessary delay the Government grant, together with their own contributions on the construction of new rural veterinary dispensaries or on improving the existing ones. The following is the detailed distribution of the Govern- ment grant-in-aid during the year under report:15 Simla Veterinary Dis- pensary. 30. The receipts and expenditure of the Simla Veterinary Dispensary during the year under report were Rs. 12,658 and Rs. 9,096, respec- tively, against Rs. 13,274 and Rs. 9,637 during the previous year.______ PART IV.16 The number of bulls issued to districts this year creates a new record for the Department, though it is far short of the number which is really required to make any marked impression on the cattle industry in this vast Province. It is satisfactory, however, that such steady progress is being maintained, and that the demand for well-bred Hissar bulls continues to exceed the supply from the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar. The Department is very anxious to improve the existing arrangements for the supply of stud bulls to districts if dis- trict boards can be induced to earmark a definite percentage of then income to the improvement of cattle breeding. This is necessary in order to overcome the present difficulty which the Department has to contend with in being unable to guarantee zamindars that even the bulls which are cast will be replaced. As noted in last year's report, any cattle im- provement scheme which cannot guarantee continuity in the supply of approved bulls to particular villages loses much of its value. Hariana Cattle Breeding Scheme. 32. The following statement shows the allotments made and the expenditure incurred by the district boards of Hissar, Rohtak and Gurgaon towards the scheme in their respective districts during the year under report :17 centage as possible of the yearly output of farm-bred bulls in the Hariana tract ana meet the demand of other districts by purchase in the tract. The districts of the Hariana tract should be regarded as selected districts for cattle breeding and a special organisation provided to develop the cattle- breeding industry of the area. I am glad to be able to note the very real interest being taken by the zamindars of the Hariana Tract in the work of the scheme. Local conditions are undoubtedly favourable to the expansion of the scheme according as funds are made available for the purchase of a larger number of bulls. One hundred and fifty stud bulls were supplied to the Gurgaon district board from the Hissar Farm, bringing the total number of approved bulls now working in that district to 617. These bulls were distributed to villagers who paid one quarter of the price. The Rohtak district board purchased 69 bulls from the Hissar Farm and an equal number of locally-bred Hariana male stock were bought for rearing on the Farm until. fit for issue to the district. The number of approved bulls now working in the Rohtak district is 265. The Hissar district Board purchased 40 bulls from the Hissar Farm, which were issued to applicants willing to pay one-quarter of the cost. The number of approved bulls now working in the Hissar district is 170. The arrangement made for the holding of small cattle shows at different centres throughout the Rohtak district is having a very good effect in popularising the work of the scheme. Besides giving an opportunity for the inspection of the produce of the bulls enrolled under the scheme, these small shows at which prize money is distributed create healthy rivalry amongst the local cattle breeders who need to come only short distances from their villages in order to compete. The Rohtak district board has been so impressed by the usefulness of the small one-day cattle show that it has doubled its allotment for prizes for the coming year, a sum of Rs. 2,400 being provided. It is hoped to be able to extend this system of holding numerous small cattle shows to the districts of Hissar and Gurgaon in the coming year if suffi- cient funds are available. Dhanni Cattle Breeding Scheme. 38. The following statement shows the allotments made and the expenditure incurred by the district boards of Attock, Rawalpindi, Jhelum and Mianwali towards the Dhanni
18 Cattle Breeding Scheme in their respective districts during the year under report:19 breed is rapidly extending in popularity as the result of the very noticeable improvement in the type of bullock now being exported from the tract and there is a consequent shortage of bulls for purchase. The fodder situation in the tract during the greater part of the year was unfavourable, the price of bhoosa reaching as high as Rs. 2-4-0 per maund. On account of this fodder scarcity the general condition of cows and young stock was with difficulty maintained which will undoubtedly affect the covering results of our stud bulls for the next year. The department feels anxious regarding the permanence of its cattle improvement work in this tract, the fodder supply of which is still so insecure due to a very uncertain rainfall. Since the Dhanni cattle breeding scheme was started in 1918- 19 there have been many serious setbacks on account of fodder scarcity, the effects of which might have been more serious only for the almost uncanny way in which the local zamin- dars can manage to keep their well-bred cattle alive through famine periods. The Dhanni tract is now becoming so im- portant a source of supply for plough bullocks of a superior type, in demand for the North and many of the Cential Punjab districts, that the greater development of the fodder re- sources of the Dhanni tract would deserve special attention and if possible some scheme of fodder conservation against famine put into operation even on a small scale. The Department is anxious to make clear its policy with regard to the subsidising of female stock as a means of im- proving cattle breeding within the tract. With the limited funds at its disposal since the scheme was started, it was regarded as more productive to utilise these small sums of money on the m intenance of as many approved stud bulls as possible and to apply the major portion of the small grant of rupees one thousand earmarked for prize distribution in the four districts of the tract to owners of cows entered in the Dhanni herd book. The Department will naturally welcome an opportunity to encourage by means of subsidies to cows the more careful rearing of female stock, the neglect of which it regards as the most serious defect in the system of cattle management as practised by the Dhanni cattle breeder. The increased grants which are now being made both by Government and the district boards towards the work of the scheme will, it is hoped, make it possible for special provision to be made for the encouragement of female stock.
20 The system of holding small one-day cattle shows with distribution of prizes at different centres in the course of the Deputy Commissioner's or the Superintendent's tours is having a very beneficial effect in stimulating interest amongst the small breeders. In spite of the fodder shortage of the past year, there was a vast improvement noticeable in the con- dition of the female stock exhibited at these shows in com- parison with former years. PART II.21 ing purposes. The Department will, as circumstances permit, maintain stallion power under the sanctioned strength and in due course decide whether a permanent reduction can be made. PART III.22 PART IV.23 Thus at the close of the year the sanctioned cadre of the subordinate veterinary staff was 344:24 sanads were awarded to various persons in the Province who had rendered special help to the Department during the year. 43. The very marked increase in the clerical work of the Department, as a result of the expansion which has taken place in accordance with the five years programme of develop- ment, is a cause of some anxiety to the Chief Superintendent and the Officers working under him. Proposals have been made in April 1927 to free the Superintendents for more active touring work, by the appointment of responsible clerical staff in each office and a decision is anxiously awaited. Meanwhile the clerical staff are carrying on under diffi- culties and credit is due to the head clerks of the Superin- tendents' offices at Lahore, Ferozepore and Rawalpindi who have willingly responded. Particularly I would mention Lala Ram Rattan, head clerk of the office at Lahore, and the accountant B. Bhola Ram for their attention to duty in face of the extra responsibility thrown upon them as the result of the expansion in the Department. The Chief Superintendent records his special apprecia- tion of the work done by Deputy Superintendents Khan Sahib M. Talib Khan and Khwaja Ghulam Hassan in connection with the tour of the Demonstration train during the cold weather months. For the satisfactory progress in the work of the Depart- ment he wishes to thank Messrs. Garewal and Egan for the zeal and energy shown in improving the work of their circles. The assistance so willingly given by District Officers to the Department during the year is gratefully acknowledged. T. F. QUIRKE, Chief Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab.
25 Annual Report of the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, for the year 1927-28. I.26 Bir grasses although normal in bulk, were dried up and withered 6 weeks earlier than usual. Grazing was sufficient for practically the whole year, and an average amount of hay was saved. Winter rainfall was unusually heavy, and although good for Rabi crops, is usually detrimental to grazing. The Bir grasses do not grow well in the cold weather, and rain accentuates the activities of white ants against dry standing grass. Canal supplies were the best known to living memory in this district, all canals ran nearly full supply for nearly 30 days each month, instead of the usual 10 days or less. The supply of labour was normal. The usual difficulties being experienced at harvest time, but the incidence of malaria was less than usual. IV.27 Four hundred and thirty-nine stud bulls were issued28 carcases, and whole coloured. I do not think it should be long before we could breed a pure country bred ram capable also of improving the quality of the wool. To cope with the increased demand for farm bred bulls Government have approved of proposals to increase the herd of breeding cows to 3,000 head and arrangements are being made for improved supplies of water to farm tail outlets from the Sirsa Branch. VI.29 Rinderpest.30 seed, and our own seed from imported varieties, and from local Jowars. This should be possible now that the farm staff is up to full strength. Oats sown in the autumn of 1927 was to all appearance a heavy crop. It was, however, damaged by the heavy dust storm which swept over the Punjab on the 4th of March. I doubt if actual yields of clean oats will be as heavy as was at first estimated. So far the percentage of small shrivelled grains in the corn threshed has been greater than usual. The yield of one farm (Mundianwala) has, however, markedly increased. This farm is the most distant from manure supplies, and usually has low yields. A good deal of it was manured before oat sow- ing this year, with the help of the lorry, and the yield has doubled as a result.

31 Gram.32 Annual Report of Live Stock Officer 1927-28. I remained in charge of the office of Live Stock Officer for the whole of year under report. Unfortunately owing to shortage of staff, I also had to retain charge of the Govern- ment Cattle Farm, Hissar, throughout the year as well. Work on the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, tends every year to increase and consequently I have been able to spare very little time to develop the work of the Live Stock Officer. The post of Deputy Superintendent to the Live Stock Expert has been vacant throughout the year. As Live Stock Expert I toured for 93 days. The work I have attempted to carry on as Live Stock Officer may be roughly divided into two heads. First.33 The large head of stock to be maintained has been especially felt by the holders of the Hariana breed grants. Harriana cattle being much larger, they require much more feeding than Sahniwals, and they do not take so readily to stall feeding conditions. In spite of the large head of stock maintained some very good quality Harriana breed cattle have been and are being bred on these farms, and I am now convinced that good quality Hariana breed cattle can be bred in the Western Punjab. This applies especially to the less highly strung types which settle down to the abnormal conditions more readily than the more nervous types. One of the Hariana grantees, M. Ghulam Qadir, has paid especial attention to the milking qualities of his cows, he has kept milk records for several years and has collected sufficient evidence to prove that a condsiderable per cent. of his herd are genuine dual purposes animals : i.e. good for both milk and work. The two large grants for Montgomery cattle are both in Multan districts. So far as milking qualities are concerned, there are signs on both farms that progress is being made. As regards working qualities, I fear that there is not much evidence of any marked improvement. There is little or no demand of the Sahniwal bullock even right in the home of the breed. The grantees have the greatest difficulty in dis- posing of their castrated male stock, and the demand for bulls of good pedigree, as regards milk, is very poor. This difficulty has been particularly felt by the Manager of the Jahangirbad Farm. This Farm has always been very well managed, all stock, even cast stock awaiting dis- posal, are always kept in really good condition but the Manager cannot sell even the larger type of Sahniwal bullock at any- thing approaching remunerative prices. There are a considerable number of really good milkers on these two farms, quite a number of the cows are cap- able of over 4,000 lbs. in a lactation period, and we shall soon be able to eliminate cows capable of less than 3,000 lbs. The best milker, I have seen, however, on any of the farms was a Montgomery cow on the dairy grant. She was milked in my presence and was giving considerably over 40 lbs. per day. She came from the old Kaliana herd (A grant discontinued in 1925).
34 The Shergarh Small Holders Grants.35 II.36 A whole time Live Stock Officer should, when available, be able to put in much useful work in addition to supervising farms, in co-operation with the Co-operative Department so far as that Department is concerned with stock farming. He should visit a large proportion of the cattle shows and fairs throughout the Province, visit and advise Gaushalas and private dairies and breeders. He should also as soon as staff becomes available organise cattle surveys in all the better cattle breeding districts in the Province. My thanks are due to my Head Clerk Babu Manphul Singh. He has worked especially hard at the registers of the Grantees Farms and has succeeded in reducing them to order. R. BRANFORD, Live Stock Expert to Government, Punjab, Hissar.

IV.Review of the Annual Report of the Civil Veterin- ary Department, Punjab, for the year 1928-29. On July the 3rd, 1928, the Veterinary Work of the Province was separated from its long connection with the Department of Agriculture and entrusted to a new department under the control of a Director, Civil Veterinary Department. Under him were placed the Veterinary College with its Principal, the Hissar Cattle Farm with its Superintendent, and the field staff engag- ed on veterinary work proper. In addition, there is a Live Stock Officer, whose duties have been more closely defined since the close of the year, and a Research Officer. Arrangements are in train to divide the Province into five circles corresponding to the revenue divisions, each under a Superintendent. Under him, each district will eventually be in charge of a Deputy Superin- tendent. The old grade of Inspectors is being abolished. It is intended that in time the Deputy Superintendent shall be a fully qualified Veterinary Surgeon to whom will be entrusted preventive work against contagious diseases and general supervision of the hospitals and dispensaries in his charge. The latter are for the most part in charge of Veterinary Assistants. No decision has yet been reach- ed on the recommendation of the Royal Commission that these should be manned with assistants with a specialised training on the ox. 2. The separation of the Veterinary from the Agricultural Department has provided the Director with wider scope for useful activity. The responsibility for further development now rests with the technical head, and there is an air of confidence in the report under review that augurs well for the future. During the year, the total expenditure amounted to Rs. 24.6 lakhs of which 13.9 came from provincial revenues and the rest from local bodies; of this it may be argued that far too large a proportion was devoted to the cure of non-contagious diseases and of similar ailments, which in a more advanced country would be paid for by the owners of the animals treated. But in the present day conditions of the Province facilities for treatment must be provided from public revenues, if there is to be any skilled treatment at all. There is as yet little indica-
2 tion of the development of a body of trained practition- ers living by private practice. 3. Training.3 The treatment of Surra continues to receive special attention from the staff of the Department, and although the fly survey operations have been abandoned other special lines of activity continue. 5. Preventive measures against contagious diseases are slowly gaining in popularity, but they are hardly yet carried out on a scale sufficient to influence morta- lity from these causes in the Province at large. In the case of Rinderpest very little progress has been made in the last 10 years, but the results of recent research into the serum simultaneous method open up the prospect of a widespread campaign in favour of the more perma- nent protection of valuable cattle. The Director is not yet in favour of attempting to carry out wholesale serum simultaneous treatment of all cattle in a large area. But the Ministry of Agriculture considers that the results obtained in Egypt and in Mysore might be studied more closely. In Egypt the method is now in general use, and if Mysore can show success from its campaign of universal inoculation, the case for attempt- ing to drive Rinderpest out of the Province by this method should be further considered. 6. In the treatment of animals apart from conta- gious diseases considerable progress continues to be made, and the time is rapidly approaching when all stock owners in the Province will be within easy reach of skilled attention. The number of Veterinary Hospitals is now 258 as compared with 129 ten years ago; the number of animals treated has increased in far greater proportion, from 2,91,085 ten years ago to 8,57,951 in the year under report. 7. The attempt to improve the breeds of cattle in the Province continues along the two lines of the provi- sion of pedigree stud bulls and the castration of unsuit- able sires. Of stud bulls the number is now 3,130 as compared with 1,265 ten years ago; the number of cas- trations was 1,60,465 as compared with 16,728 ten years ago. The main supply of stud bulls continues to be the Hissar Cattle Farm, but contributions are now being- made from grantee farms; in addition successful efforts are being made to improve cattle in the Hariana and
4 Dhanni tracts along well thought out lines. Unfor- tunately the Hariana scheme has met with a setback owing to the severe scarcity of fodder, and there was a similar but less severe dearth of fodder in the Dhanni tract. In both areas it is claimed that the schemes have very definitely raised the standard of bullocks available. The Hissar Cattle Farm was well administered during the year, and its capacity to turn out pedigree bulls is being steadily increased. Were more fodder available progress on these lines would be more rapid. During the year a larger area has been brought under cultivation, and the head of stock is being gradually increased. Some interesting experiments are being carried out with varieties of fodder and now that the water supply has been improved there is some hope that these experiments may yield results of value. More attention is being paid to milk and it may perhaps become necessary in the future to remind the Superintendent of the view expressed by the Royal Commission on Agriculture, that the attempt to provide dual-purpose cattle equally suitable for draught and for milk should only be made where the prospects for suc- cessful bull production are markedly above the average. In a country, such as the Punjab, the chief aim must continue to be the production of cows which are capable of rearing calves that will grow into useful draught bullocks. It is too early yet to pronounce judgment on the attempts that are being made to improve the breeds of sheep and goats, but the Ministry of Agriculture is watching the work with great interest. 8 The Live Stock Officer is in general charge of breeding operations except at the (Hissar Cattle Farm), but his chief occupation for some years to come must be a careful scientific survey of cattle throughout the Province with a view to collecting material for decisions as to the best lines on which to improve breeds. It is hoped that as a whole-time officer he will be able to exercise closer supervision over the grantee cattle farms; there is a marked tendency amongst the grantees to pay more attention to their crops than to their cattle; they possess little technical knowledge of cattle-breeding and lack a sufficiently trained stall; the breeding of cattle is,
5 in fact, subsidiary to the growing of remunerative crops. This must be changed, and pressure must be brought to bear to ensure the fullest compliance with the conditions of the grant, and instances must be reported to Gov- ernment where the grantees refuse to adopt the advice of the Live Stock Officer, aimed at ensuring more complete realization of the object of these grants. The Shergarh small holdings scheme is still in its experimen- tal stage; milk records are being kept and pedigree registers maintained. But the grantees lack enthu- siasm in the cause of scientific cattle-breeding. 9. The Ministry of Agriculture is convinced that the prosperity of agriculture is closely linked with the improvement of Live Stock. The Royal Commission rightly pointed out that cattle improvement depends largely on better breeding and feeding, so that the milk- ing qualities of cows, and the ploughing efficiency of bullocks may steadily increase. The Ministry of Agriculture wishes to draw special attention to the recommen lations of the Royal Commission and would be glad if future reports give some account of the efforts made to give effect to these recommendations. There are now 258 hospitals in charge of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons; it would not be too much to expect that every Veterinary Assistant Surgeon should take interest at least in one village in his circle in the neighbourhood of his hospital and should carefully study its requirements, in the matter of milk supply, the number of bullocks required for ploughing, and its fodder resources. It need hardly be said that the elimination of Scrub Bulls by castration and their replacement by locally selected bulls, where pedigree bulls are not available, is of the utmost importance. The Royal Commission held that there were far more bullocks than were required for the actual work of ploughing, and that they were not properly fed. The Ministry would welcome a careful investigation of this problem in specially selected villages. It may then be possible to organise and encourage co-operative ploughing in cases of small holdings which cannot afford the cost of maintaining a pair of bullocks. It may be mentioned that to cultivate 100 acres 8 pairs
6 of bullocks are required and that the cost of mainten- ance of a pair is in the neighbourhood of Rs. 150. The Ministry is aware that the absence of village grazing; grounds is detrimental to the health of both man and his stock and hopes that with the awakening in the villages it may be possible to arrange a rotation by co-operation of the whole village which would secure a common grazing and fodder area every year for the use of the village. The correct period for harvesting cereals to get the maximum value for straw and grain offers another line of enquiry. Where grasses are poor as in the hills and lowlying areas, proper mixtures will have to be introduced. The Dhanni and the hill cows need special attention as well as buffaloes. The Ministry recognises the need of close co-operation between the Departments of Agriculture and Veterinary particularly in the matter of research and expects that the Research Council will bring about co-ordination which is desirable to foster and encourage co-operation and a spirit of mutual helpfulness in the field of research. Mr. Quirke was Chief Superintendent of the Department from the beginning of the year till 4th July, 1928, when he assumed charge as Director, Civil Veterinary Department. The Punjab Government (Ministry of Agriculture) wishes to acknowledge his careful attention to the organisation of his Department. Mr. Taylor, Principal, Veterinary College, Lahore, who has been officiating as Director since March 1929, has written the main report: the Veterinary College owes not a little to his enthusiasm for Veterinary Education. Mr. L. W. Smith who assumed charge of the Hissar Cattle Farm from his distinguished predecessor, Mr. Branford, has made a good beginning. Mr. Garewal assumed charge as Live Stock Officer in July 1928, and continued in charge of his own circle till when his duties were defined and he was appointed as an Assistant to the Director for breeding and Live Stock, in which capacity he will carry on Live Stock work through the ordinary Veterinary staff of the Department.

Taylor held the charge of the Institution during the year under report till he was appointed to officiate as the Direc- tor, Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, on the 12th March 1929. Captain Walker officiated as Principal and Lala Durga Das as the Professor of Medicine in addition to their usual duties. Major E. Nicholl was appointed as the Research Officer attached to the Punjab Veterinary College by the High Com- missioner in England. He joined his appointment on the 10th of December 1928 (forenoon). Lala Durga Dass, Chaudhri Mushtaq Ahmad and Syed Riazul Hassan, 1st grade Clinical Assistants, were promot- ed to the Provincial Service on the 16th February 1927, the 16th August 1926 and the 1st April 1928, respectively. Non-gazetted Staff. 2. There had been no change beyond the promotion of the above three officers into the Provincial Service. Admissions. 3. The educational standard for admission into this College was raised to Intermediate in Science or Arts Faculty during the year. One hundred and thirty-five candidates offered themselves for admission in October last, out of which 47 candidates were admitted as detailed below :2 Examinations. 5. The annual examinations took place in the 1st week of June and the supplementary examination, for students who failed in one subject only, was held early in October with the following results :3 Special Work. 9. Major Nicholl, the Research Officer, has started investigations on the following diseases and has visited the following places to study conditions and gather material to work on :4 and Endo parasites were also examined in this section during the year. Demonstration train. 10. Specimens of common animal parasites of public interest were prepared and supplied along with models and other material supplied last year for the Demonstration train. Income. 11. Net income from all sources of the College during the year was Rs. 32,949 against Rs. 27,652 last year. The increase is due to the increase in the number of students at the College and the patients treated. Expenditure. 12. The total cost was Rs. 1,80,763 against Rs. 1,58,086 last year, the increased expenditure is proportionately distributed amongst the pay of officers, the pay of Establishment and partly to con- tingencies due to the prevailing high priecs of the fodder, etc. Employment. 13. The demand of qualified men continues to exceed the supply, and measures are being taken to admit a larger number of Punjab Civil Students. Increased Laboratory accommodation, and a slight increase in the teaching staff will be necessary to do this. General Remarks. 14. During the year the health and behaviour of the students continued to be good. The interest in games and sports was revived as the lawns and fields in the hostel compound could be levelled and irrigated owing to the tube well coming into action early last year. The Principal is pleased to record his appreciation of the work of the staff throughout the year. Sohawa Laboratory. 15. Chaudhri Kahan Singh remained in charge of the office of the Camel Specialist, Sohawa, throughout the year. Owing to the comparative failure of the monsoon Surra was less prevalent than usual. The number of animals treated for Surra at all the newly added and the old Surra centres as detailed in the statement below was 31 camels and 109 ponies. At Sohawa 613 animals belonging to private owners were treated for diseases other than Surra.

North-West Frontier Provinces, and 23 students belonging to the 4th Year Class of the Punjab Veterinary College were trained in the treatment of Surra during the year. Veterinary Inspector B. Abdullah Khan was deputed for a ten days' training in the treatment of Surra by Intrathe- cal method of injection in October last at the Imperial Insti- tute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar. The Fly Survey operations restarted in 1926 were finally abandoned during the year. Experiments. 16. The following experiments were undertaken during the year with a view to ascertaining (i) whether the Trypanosomes enter the spinal fluid on intravenous injections of germicidal drugs, till after the effect is over (18 experiments). (ii) To ascertain whether the "Bayer 205 and Tartar Emetic" method of Surra treatment cleanses the spinal fluid of Trypanosomes or not. (Eleven experiments). The results obtained so far are favourable.
6 (iii) To find out whether the Trypanosomes remain present in the spinal fluid or not, even at the time they are absent or present in the peripheral circulation ten experi- ments were undertaken. If so, after what period or in which paroxysms of the disease do they go there is also being watched. Twenty-three further experiments with O.

Taylor, M.R.C.V.S., D.V.H., I.V.S., officiating Director, Civil Veteri- nary Department, Punjab. I.8 5. Again this year the Department took part in the Demonstration train which toured the Province from Oc- tober to April. A complete Veterinary Car was fitted up, of which full advantage was taken to demonstrate by means of simple interesting exhibits, the work being done for the improvement of the live-stock of the Province. 6. Cattle breeding propaganda films lent by the Imperial Dairy Expert were shown throughout the tour and these were accompanied by lectures and demonstrations of the local breeds of cattle, sheep and goats by our staff. Magic lantern slides illustrating diseases of live-stock in conjunction with lectures, dealing with the economic losses to stock owners from these different diseases, were a regular feature of the Department's propaganda work carried out at the different centres visited. 7. The Director acted as an Examiner at the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore, for the L. V. P. Examination. He attended the meeting held to consider the recommenda- tions of the Royal Commission on Agriculture and the Agricultural Conference which were held at Simla. 8. The Director toured in the Hariana and Dhanni Cattle Breeding tracts to examine the progress of the work done there. He also visited the grantee farms in the Lower Bari Doab Canal Colony, the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, and many other places in the Province during the course of the year. II.9 Examination and collec- tion of Pathological speci- mens. 10. During the year 72 specimens were received from the subordinate veterinary staff for examination. These were, as usual, examined in the Laboratories attached to the offices of the Director at Lahore and Superintendents at Rawalpindi and Ferozepore. (a) Equines. NOTE.10 Dourine.11 own efforts in carrying out quite simple protective measures, the present incidence of disease in villages can be very con- siderably reduced. Under the circumstances explained therefore the Director feels that it would be advisable to commence the serum simultaneous method of inoculation on a scale neces- sary for the protection of the more valuable animals only and not as a general routine method for adoption to field conditions in this Province.

Thus at the close of the year there were 258 veterinary hospitals in the Province, as shown in the map at the end of this report. Government has also sanctioned the appointment of the additional staff mentioned below for special breeding tracts and low-lying areas and for the opening of 8 new dis- pensaries during the year 1929-30 :15 Assistant- is, therefore gradually assuming more normal proportions and offers greater scope for supervision. Building of Veterinary hospitals. 31. Many hospitals are still located in unsuitable, temporary or hired buildings. The Dis- trict Boards concerned are being in- duced to provide buildings on the lines of the approved standard plans according as funds are avail- able. It is hoped with the help of Government grant-in-aid for the construction of new veterinary hospitals, that suitable buildings will be provided at many of these places in the course of the next few years. Government grant-in-aid. 32. Steps have been taken to impress upon District Boards concerned the importance of utilizing without unnecessary delay, the Government grant, together with their own contributions on the construction of new rural veterinary hospitals or on improving the existing ones. The following is the detailed distribution of the Govern- ment grant-in-aid during the year under report :16 Simla Veterinary Dis- pensary. 33. The receipts and expenditure of the Simla Veterinary Dispensary during the year under report were Rs. 12,425 and 9,227, respectively, against Rs. 12,658 and 9,096 during the previous year. IV.17 however, yet succeeded in making other district boards adhere to any regular scheme of supply. The advice given by the Ministry of Agriculture in its review of the last year's work of this Department is very opportune, it is hoped that it will have the desired effect in improving the system of supply and distribution of stud bulls in districts. Hariana Cattle Breeding Scheme. 35. The following statement shows the allotments made and the expenditure incurred by the district boards of Hissar, Rohtak and Gurgaon towards the scheme in their respective districts during the year under report:18 The holding of numerous small one day village shows at different centres in the tract is having a very good effect and is now regarded as a most valuable method of propaganda for popularising the scheme. The Department intends to increase the number of these village shows as far as funds permit and is very hopeful of their ultimate effect on cattle breeding. Dhanni Cattle Breeding Scheme. 36. The following statement shows the allotments and expenditure incurred by the dis- trict boards of Attock, Rawalpindi, Jhelum, Shahpur and Mianwali towards the Dhanni Cattle Breeding Scheme in their respective dis- tricts during the year :19 The fodder situation in the tract was again difficult for cattle rearing. The sales of cattle at unremunerative prices were much heavier than in normal years owing to the dearth of fodder. Notwithstanding the difficulties, however, the interest now being taken by the average Dhanni cattle breeder is very much greater than formerly as the result of the very ready sale for Dhanni bullocks of a good type to zamindars in the Central Punjab districts. The work of the scheme has very definitely raised the standard of the Dhanni bullocks now available for sale from the tract. II.20 III.21 grazing. They have too delicate a constitution unless kept under ideal conditions. A number of Damani rams was introduced into the Mianwali district from the North-West Frontier Province chiefly into the "Thal" ilaqa, they however did not stand the adverse conditions there and a number of them died. Sheep breeding, to a certain extent, is also carried on in the Canal Colony areas of Multan Revenue Division but the work there is chiefly in the hands of uneducated low caste nomadic classes. Propaganda work was done in certain other districts of the Province as a result of which several applications for the supply of sheep were received from bona fide sheep-bree- ders of Amritsar, Lahore and Dera Ghazi Khan districts. IV.22 in the number of Co-operative Cattle Breeding Societies and is making every effort to meet their requirements. It does not, however, attach so much importance to the opening of societies as it does to the help which the staff of the Co- operative Department can give in discussing with members of Co-operative Societies the economics of cattle-breeding as at present practised in the majority of our Indian villages. VII.23 Of the total expenditure, a sum of Rs. 13,92,167 was contributed by Government and Rs. 10,68,395 by local bodies. The figures shown under "Provincial" were supplied by the Accountant-General, Punjab, as usual, whilst those under "Local" were obtained from the local bodies concerned. IX.24 Lala Ram Rattan and the Accountant, B. Bhola Ram, both of whom have laboured zealously to expedite the work of the Department during this period of transition. Their example has had a very excellent effect on the other members of the clerical staff who have also had to undertake much additional work before the necessary increase in establishment- had been sanctioned by Government. The Director wishes to record his appreciation of the good work done by all the Deputy Superintendents. The names of Khan Sahib M. Talib Khan and Khwaja Ghulam Hassan deserve special mention for their untiring zeal and energy shown during the year in furthering the cause of the Department. The Director's thanks are also due to Messrs. Garewal and Egan for the efficient manner in which they managed their resp ective circles in spite of the many changes which took place during the year on account of the separation of the Department from the Department of Agriculture. The assistance given by District Officers to the officers of all grades of this Department is gratefully acknowledged. W. TAYLOR, Offg. Director, Veterinary Services, Punjab.
25 Annual Report of the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, for the year 1928-29. I.26 as against an indent for 510. Enquiries for cattle are constantly being received from other provinces and states. The great majority of them have to be refused as the Punjab zamindars are given preference. The cope with the repeated demand of the district boards in the Hariana Tract all the best white cows of Rohtak type numbering about 400 were selected out of the main herd and put with bulls of the same colour and type. This should produce the kind of young bulls that they require. Efforts- are also being made to purchase the best of the locally bred Hariana cows for breeding male stock of the type which is preferred by the Zamindars of the Rohtak and Gurgaon Districts. The breeders from the North Punjab prefer the grey and more massive type of animals, arrangements have been made to breed the type they require. Improvements to Dairy.27 One of our best cows has yielded 8,134 lbs. in 305 days (4th lactation)28 5. Arab Breeding.29 C.30 from this channel unless the gauge is maintained at not less than 12 inches. From October to the end of December the gauge only shewed 12 inches on 12 separate days instead of thirty. Hardly any oats would have been sown on the Chhaoni Farm had it not been for a timely shower of rain amounting to § inch on the 29th/30th November. The oats was sown barani in the hope of getting sufficient canal water later to mature it. This hope was doomed to disappoint- ment; only enough water was received to keep alive the first few acres of early sowings, and the barani oats had to be cut as very poor oat hay, to save anything from it at all. The Superintending Engineer, Western Jumna Canals, went very thoroughly into the matter and has caused outlets above the Farm which were drawing more water than the proper share to be remodelled. This has improved the supply in the Dabra Minor, and will probably end the long- standing complaint about the inefficiency of this Minor so far as the Farm is concerned. 5. Cultivation.31 resistant" oats seed sent to the Farm by the Cerealist, Lyallpur Agricultural College. Borer caused no serious trouble in the Kharif. The almost total failure of winter rain was very bad for barani crops, and the yields were very poor. No serious labour difficulty was experienced and malarial and other fevers were less than usual owing to the dryness of the year. The fodder famine in the locality led to an epidemic of fodder stealing on the Farm, which was quickly checked by catching and prosecuting several offenders. 6. The Bir.32 7. Expansion.33 here. It is a very prolific fodder juar and gives heavy yields as the statement at the end of this note shows. It was sown this year side by side with the Local variety, both from imported seed and seed grown here last year. "Sundhia, Impey, Saccoline.34 1926 my plot of Irungu Cholam was surrounded by Local Juar badly infected with Borer and Teli, but I could not find a single plant of Irungu Cholam affected. Some plants in a plot of one year acclimatised seed last year were very slightly affected. The Local varieties suffered far more. " I am of opinion that Irungu Cholam should be introduced into the Province on a large scale. The cost of getting up large quan- tities of the seed is prohibitive for this Farm or for the small-holder. I think the Agricultural Department should arrange to get up several wagons of seed early next year for distribution and also for produc- ing acclimatised seed in large quantities." V.35 5. My thanks are due to both outdoor and indoor staff for loyal and energetic support throughout the year spe- cially to Assistant Superintendents, Messrs Read and Nanda, Deputy Superintendents, M. Mohammad Jan and Sh. Mumtaz Hussain and the Head Clerk, B. Pearelal Gupta. I am specially indebted to S. Santokh Singh and Ch. Baldeo Singh, Officers-under-Training, for their keen interest and for the help they have rendered to the Farm. PHOTOGRAPHS. Photographs are included with this report as follows :36 Annual Report of Live Stock Officer to Government, Punjab, for the year 1928-29. Mr. R. Branford, I.V.S., remained in charge from 1st April 1928 to 14th July 1928 when he proceeded on long leave preparatory to retirement. He was also in charge of the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, from 1st April 1928 to 30th June 1928. He spent 16 days on tour, travelled 865 miles by rail and 268 miles by road. During the period that he was in charge as Live Stock Officer to Government, Punjab, he inspected once all the Grantee Farms. He also inspected the Gowshala at Ludhiana. The post of the Live Stock Officer to Government, Punjab, remained vacant from 15th July 1928 to 27th July 1928. I took over the charge of this post from 28th July 1928 and remained in charge till the end of the year under report. I spent 92 days on tour in connection with the Live Stock work and travelled 6,298 miles by rail and 2,392 miles by road. All the Grantee Farms were inspected by me three times during 8 months that I was in charge as Live Stock Officer to Government, Punjab. The question of Montgomery and Dajil Cattle-Breeding Schemes was taken up on the lines of Dhanni Cattle-Breeding Scheme. I would like to start Montgomery Cattle-Breeding Scheme in the zail of Kue Ki Bahawal in Dipalpur Tahsil. S. Dost Muhammad Khan and Khan Sahib Chaudhri Allah Dad Khan have offered approved bulls of Montgomery breed over 3 years of age, free of cost. Of these 25 bulls are now ready and more will be available later. There are also men willing to keep these free of cost. Dajil and area round about it, is the most suitable area for Dajil Cattle-Breeding Scheme. I visited Dhanni breeding tract and attended Talagang and Chakwal cattle fairs. Excellent arrangements were made at Chakwal to show Dhanni cows, bulls and young stock. But in years of scarcity the fodder problem is difficult to face. This breed is very popular in the Northern Districts of the Punjab. A farm for this breed of cattle should be opened in the Dhanni tract or as near it as possible. Excellent stock of Hariana breed of cattle was seen at several cattle fairs held in the Hariana tract. Rohtak District has made good progress in the Hariana Cattle-
37 Breeding Scheme, whereas Gurgaon suffered from scarcity of fodder. Cattle Fairs at Rohtak, Jhajir, Gohana, Jahazgarh, Meham, Gurgaon, Rewari and Hissar were attended and young stock of our approved bulls was noticed. Cattle Fairs at Moga, Muktsar and Ludhiana were also attended. The distribution of bulls at Hissar Farm was attended in Novem- ber 1928 and again in March 1929. An indent for 290 bulls from Rohtak, Gurgaon, Hissar and Karnal was received which is the highest indent on record. The total number of bulls which could be supplied from Hissar Farm was 323. I also remained in charge of South Punjab Circle as Sup- erintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, till the 11th of March 1929. S. Ghulam Hussain was appointed Deputy Superinten- dent, Live Stock Section, and took over the charge of this post on the 25th August 1928 and remained in charge as Deputy Superintendent till the end of the year under report. He spent 111 days on tour, travelled 2,034 miles by rail and 1,867 miles by road. He inspected Bahadarnagar Cattle farm 7 times, Qadirabad farm 8 times, Fazlabad farm 7 times, Montgomery Dairy farm 11 times, Shergarh Grantees farm 6 times, Jahangirabad 6 times and Alladad Khan Cattle farm 4 times during the year under report. S. Ghulam Hussain, Deputy Superintendent toured in Dipalpur Tahsil in connection with the Montgomery Cattle Breeding Scheme work. He went to Pakpattan in connec- tion with the taking over of the 1st Burewala farm as ordered by the Director, Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, Lahore. He accompanied me during my tour in the Dera Ghazi Khan district and also visited Pirowala forest land in connection with the utilization of the forest grass. S. Santokh Singh and Chaudhri Baldeo Singh who were appointed as Superintendent and Deputy Superintendent respectively of the Nili Bar farms remained attached to the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, as Officers-under-Training during the year under report. GRANTEE CATTLE FARMS. There are seven such grants at present. Six of these are for cattle breeding and one for Dairy. Of the six for cattle breeding, 5 are large grants to single grantees and one to a number of small holders. All of these are situated on the Lower Bari Doab Canal and constitute a part of new coloni-
38 zation. These grants of Government land are on leases made on cattle breeding conditions. The farms are being run as private enterprise under the supervision of the Civil Veterinary Department according to terms of their leases. Table below shows some particulars of the six large grants:39 Bahadarnagar Farm.40 from Khanewal at the tail of the canal. The strength of his herd was fixed 400 cows and 6 bulls originally but later on the proprietor, Chaudhri Alladad Khan, was allowed to keep 125 cows and 3 bulls up to 1929 as concession on account of inferiority of the land of the farm. The farm is well managed. This farm is away from the railway station and is under great disadvantage for the disposal of its produce. One hundred and six calves were born and 44 heifers were entered into herd after approval during the year under report. Khan Sahib Chaudhri Alladad Khan has offered 75 young bulls to be given to Government free of cost for the improvement of Montgomery breed of cattle in the Punjab. Montgomery Dairy Farm.41 careless of the economic conditions of their farms and have shown very little aptitude to take up to modern methods of scientific cattle-breeding. I would like to mention the names of S. Ghulam Hussain, Deputy Superintendent, Live Stock Section, and B. Manphul Singh, my head clerk, for the good work done by them during the year under report. J.

CHAPTER V.Review of the Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, for the year 1929-30. ALTHOUGH Civil Veterinary administration was pro- vincialised in 1901, the annual reports up to and includ- ing that for the year 1910-11 were drawn up in a single combined report for the Civil Veterinary Department in the whole of India. The report for the year 1911-12 was the first dealing only with the Punjab and was submitted by the Director of Agriculture and this is the first single self-contained report presented by the Punjab Civil Veterinary Department after its separation in July 1928, from the Department of Agriculture. 2. The Department has a definite programme aim- ing at:2 twice as valuable, weight for weight, as cabbage. The outturn of sunflower per acre exceeded by nearly 49 maunds that of berseem. An attempt has been made to introduce the salt bush from South Africa. Consider- able progress was achieved in the grading up of the Bikaner desert sheep. The productivity of sunflower and Madras jowar and the inferiority of Shaftal as com- pared with lucerne and berseem were demonstrated by experiment, during the course of the year. Valuable information is being collected as the result of stall feeding experiments. The Ministry of Agriculture is greatly interested in all these experiments, and hopes that the Department will also undertake research to determine the best nourishing ration in various agricul- tural circles of the Province. 4. In the districts cattle breeding has received a slight set back partly owing to the shortage of rain in the south-eastern districts; but the Live Stock Officer has won public support for his work in almost all the districts. The grantee farms, particularly Jahangirabad farm, are working up to the modern ideas of breeding and if proper supervision is exercised these farms can be helped to build up pedigree breeds. In Hissar, Rohtak and Gurgaon nearly 1,246 farm-bred bulls are already at work. In the Dhanni Tract 134 bulls are at work; but the Dhanni Cow has for financial reasons not yet received as much attention as the Department would like to give. The Punjab Government (Ministry of Agriculture) will be glad if some work on cows is also started. In Montgomery tract, through the generosity of the grantee of the Jahangirabad farm, 23 farm-bred bulls have been placed in selected villages in the Dipal- pur tahsil, villages have been selected in Dera Ghazi Khan for the improvement of the Dajil, and in Ludhiana district for the Malwa breeds. The Ministry of Agriculture attaches great importance to the improve- ment of local breeds by selection and is gratified that the Department has taken up this most interesting line of development. The introduction of a buffalo breeding scheme in particular villages is another promising line of work. 5. The study of the milk requirements in a village. the available supply of fodder and the elimination of poor
3 stock by better stock are lines to which Department should pay more attention by concentrating work in selected villages. The Royal Commission on Agriculture has shown that our villages generally carry a larger stock than can be supported by the fodder available and the Ministry of Agriculture will be glad if the De- partment will start enquiries in selected villages, ascertain their requirements in the matter of milk and draught animals and their fodder resources and then educate the peasant to eliminate the poor stock by replacing it with better cows and bullocks, and thus getting a better return. The proposed Nili Bar Cattle Farm still awaits the provision of funds; and the scien- tific survey of cattle throughout the province, with a view to collecting material for decision as to the best lines on which to improve breeds, has not yet progress- ed far. 6. An interesting experiment is being made, though not for the first time, in the direction of introducing Merino sheep into Kangra district. As was remarked in the report for the year 1911-12 "continued efforts and patience will be needed with a view to enlist keen- ness on the part of the owners." The Ministry hopes, however, that the present experiment will prove more successful than that of 20 years ago. It has been prov- ed that Merino sheep cannot be expected to thrive ex- cept in the cooler parts of the province. 7. As usual Rinderpest was the most destructive disease, followed by Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia. Serum simultaneous treatment has not yet been attempted on a large scale; but the staff required for such inoculation is being trained, and, in the near future, the department should be in a position to undertake a more definitely organised campaign against Rinderpest. The Ministry will await with interest proposals to this effect. 8. The treatment of Surra has been conducted with gratifying success. This treatment also depends largely on the skill and experience of those who have to carry out the injections. 9. The Punjab Veterinary College has had a suc- cessful year and the experiment initiated last year of
4 raising the Entrance qualification for admissions to the College to the Intermediate standard in Science and Arts has been justified by its results, since 36 students passed their second examination out of 47 selected. Now that the Classification Rules for the Civil Veterinary Depart- ment have been issued, it will be possible to take steps to ensure regular recruitment with stability of prospects for those entering the service. In common with other sections of the Department the College suffered from the prevailing financial stringency. The work already per- formed by the Research Officer has shown how large a field awaits action, and how little can be done unless money is invested in the necessary facilities for carrying out the work. Such developments, however, must per- force await better times; meanwhile the foundations are being laid for further research work. 10. Twenty years ago the Civil Veterinary Depart- ment in the Punjab, including then the North-West Frontier, Province, was by far the most important sphere of veterinary work in India. Of a total expenditure of 20½ lakhs in the whole of India in 1909-10, nearly 5 lakhs was expended on veterinary administration in the Punjab and the North-West Frontier Province. In these two provinces 839 castrations were performed out of 1,662 in the whole of India, and out of the total num- ber of cases otherwise treated in the whole of India, amounting to 968,044, 356,051 were treated in these provinces. In the year under report the total expen- diture, partly by local bodies and partly by the Punjab Government, on veterinary objects has risen to Rs. 33½ lakhs, the Government contribution amounting to Rs.14,09,912 and even this figure, owing to financial strin- gency, showed a decrease of nearly Rs. 1½ lakhs on the expenditure of the year 1928-29. The number of castra- tions in the Punjab alone rose to 384,191. The total number of preventive inoculations and vaccinations performed amounted to 476,406, and the total num- ber of animals otherwise treated was 1,210,179. The latest figures available for the whole of India are those of 1927-28. In that year the number of castra- tions in the Punjab (272,185) was more than half the number of castrations in the whole of India (408,296). The number of inoculations and vaccinations in the
5 Punjab (649,771) was more than one-third of the total in the whole of India (1,727,055) and the number of cases otherwise treated in the Punjab (1,232,643) was more than one-third of the total number of cases treated in the whole of India (3,426,836). The number of in- stitutions in the Punjab (241) was more than one- quarter of the number in the whole of India (831). In the present year the number of Veterinary Hospitals, however, has risen to 270; but even now one hospital goes to about 140 villages a position which can be hardly regarded as satisfactory. 11. The Minister feels that no one will be able to read the report without appreciating the skill, know- ledge and enthusiasm which are brought to bear on the problems of animal husbandry in the province. The efficiency of the teaching in the Veterinary College is acknowledged almost as much outside the province as within; the work being carried out at the Hissar Cattle Farm is perhaps less well known owing to the remote- ness of its situation; but there are few institutions, if any, in the Punjab which repay better a few hours inspection. Every aspect of the farm work reflects the care and skill of those in-charge and the Minister would be glad if more people could be induced to visit the finest institution of its kind East of Suez, The pre- ventive and curative work of the Department is now extended into the villages, and the single fact that over one and-a-half million animals were treated in one way or another is itself sufficient evidence of the benefits which are being conferred. 12. The Punjab Government (Ministry of Agricul- ture) wishes to acknowledge the excellent work performed by all officers in the Department under the control of Mr. Quirke and to congratulate him on the results achieved; it also wishes to place on record its apprecia- tion of the work done at the College under Mr. Taylor and at the Hissar Farm under Mr. L. W. Smith. By order of the Punjab Government (Ministry of Agriculture). JOGENDRA SINGH, J. W. HEARN, Minister for Agriculture. Secretary to Government, Punjab, Revenue Department
Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, Punjab, for the year 1929-30, BY Mr. T. F. Quirke, M. R. C. V. S., I. V. S., Director, Veterinary Services, Punjab. CHAPTER I.2 CHAPTER II.-Live Stock. (A) BREEDING OPERATIONS. 1. GOVERNMENT CATTLE FARM, HISSAR. 4. Mr. L. W. Smith held charge of the farm as Superintendent throughout the year. Visitors to the farms included3 Supply of bulls to dis- trict boards. 8. Three hundred and twenty-eight bulls were issued to district boards compared with 324 during the previous year. In addition, there were 150 bulls ready for issue from the Farm in March 1930, but, owing to fodder famine in the Hariana Districts, these remained undistributed. 9. There are now some 100 odd selected cows and heifers from the farm herd of a milch type receiving special feeding and treatment suited to dairy cattle. The following statement shows the milk yield of some of these cows and heifers:4 Sheep-breeding. 11. There are two separate flocks of sheep main- tained on the farm5 out of which 21 donkey and 6 pony mares subsequently aborted. Hospital. 17. The brief summary of the work done at the farm hospital is as follows:6 amounting to, 7,016 on the farm at the end of the year, whilst the local rainfall rate, as well as the irrigation facilities, do not permit of any large expansion of the cultivated area. Expansion. 20. The new blocks at Thaska and Balak were considerably improved during the year under report. Rectangulation and general lay-out of the culti- vated area were further developed, with very satisfactory results. Experiments and new crops. 21. Experiments in fodder crops are being carried out at the stable, and the Mundianwala blocks, cabbage, Guinea grass, shaf- tal, Madras juar, sunflower and salt bush, being given special attention. The superiority of juar, as a fodder-yielding crop for the farm, is well established. Madras juar is re- ported to be the best yielding fodder juar yet grown on the Farm. Sunflower is regarded as a very promising green fodder for the farm. The outturn per acre of sunflower exceeded berseem by nearly 49 maunds. The salt bush of South Africa has proved a highly drought-resisting plant so badly needed in the arid areas of the Punjab. Small patches of salt bush started from seed have now been established on the farm. It is too early to express any definite opinion as to its useful- ness. From a few plants imported in July 1929, there is now an area of 3 acres of Guinea grass established. Shaftal was found to be less productive than lucerne or berseem on the farm, and has been discontinued as a farm fodder crop. General. Bhoosa waggon. 22. An improved type of bhoosa waggon, as will appear from the photograph attached to this report, was designed and built in the farm workshop by the Assistant Superintendent, Fodder, Mr. Read. It weighs, unladen, 20½ maunds, whilst its carrying capacity is 20 maunds of bhoosa.

There are under departmental supervision 6 grantee farms in the Lower Bari Doab Canal Colony, including a dairy grant of 485 acres near Montgomery, for the supply of milk to that city. The table above gives some details of the number of stock carried on these farms. The Jehangirabad Farm shows the greatest pro- gress up-to-date. The farm stock have been consistently well looked after by the grantee, who has also shown a willingness to improve the general management of his farm in accordance with the recommendations of the department. There has now been built up on this farm a herd of Montgomery cows representative of the best types of this breed from which surplus heifers are gradually being absorbed into the districts. Cream to the value of Rs. 20,451 was sold to the Military Dairy Farm, Lahore Cantonment, at 13 annas per lb. The limiting factor to any substantial progress on this and
8 the other grantee farms is that the grantees are not sufficiently keen in practising modern methods of animal husbandry, which they regard with certain dis- favour because of the additional labour and cost involved. The department is greatly handicapped in this respect because the conditions of these grants do not insist on the appointment of fully trained dairy supervisors on these farms, nor do the present market prices for milk and other dairy products offer sufficient inducement to the grantees for any voluntary effort in this direction. The more frequent visits of the Live Stock Officer and his assistant to these farms are, however, having a very good effect on their general progress. Shergarh small holders' grants. 24. These grants, consisting of 218½ rectangles of land in 7 different chaks, are situated at a distance of about 12 miles from Renala Khurd Railway Station and 8 miles from Wan Radha Ram Railway Station in the Montgomery District. Cows giving less than 2,000 lbs. of milk in a 300 days' lactation period are not approved. The milk yield of all the approved cows, which are all of the Montgomery breed, is recorded and pedigree herd registers maintained by the Co-operat- ive Department. 3. CATTLE BREEDING IN SPECIAL TRACTS. (a) Hariana Tract. 25. The following statement shows the allotments made, and the expenditure incurred, by the district boards of Hissar, Rohtak and Gurgaon towards the Hariana cattle improvement scheme:9 Fodder shortage was very keenly felt during the year under report, particularly in the Hissar and Gur- gaon Districts. The number of bulls supplied, and the total number of approved bulls now working, in the three districts of the Hariana scheme are as follows:10 Shahpur and Mianwali Districts towards the Dhanni cattle improvement scheme:11 The number of bulls supplied this year as well as the total number of approved bulls now, working in these districts is as follows:12 (2) Nili Bar Cattle-breeding Scheme. 28. A scheme is under preparation for the starting of a 9,000 acres' Government Cattle Farm in the Nili Bar Colony for the breeding of Dajil cattle, in addition to buffalo-breeding. The lands have been taken over by the department and leased out on temporary cultivation to tenants, pending financial provision being made for their utilisation as a stock-breeding farm. (3) Dajil Village Cattle-breeding Scheme, Dera Ghazi Khan District 29. The areas of Dajil, Lalgarh and other villages of the Jampur Tahsil have been selected for concentrating Dajil bulls. All preliminary arrangements have been made in anticipation of the provision of funds by the district board. The department has started a vigorous castration campaign in the selected area. 4) Malwa Cattle breeding Scheme. 30. This scheme for the resuscitation of the Malwa breed of cattle is being tried in the home of that breed ly- ing within the Ferozepore and Ludhiana Districts. Forty Hissar bulls given by the grantee of the Bahadurnagar Cattle Farm, free of cost, in the interests of the scheme, as well as 35 Hissar bulls purchased by the district boards (15 by the District Board, Ferozepore, and 20 by the District Board, Ludhiana), have been concentrated in selected villages. This breed, once famous for its speed and stamina in the tract, is nearly related to the Hariana breed, of which it is be ieved to be an off shoot. (5) Improvement of Cattle- and Buffalo-breeding in the Lahore District. 31. The Department is concentrating attention on certain zails around Kahna Nau in Tahsil Lahore where local conditons are favourable to the improvement of stock. Seventy-nine Hissar bulls have this year been concen trated in selected villages. I have been very favourably impressed by the improvement hitherto effected within this area by the department in raising the standard of the village type by location of our Hissar bulls. I am confident that we may expect quite substantial results in future as the result of this policy of concentration.
13 The introduction of a buffalo-breeding scheme in particular villages of this area is also under contemplation. 4. GENERAL BREEDING WORK IN DISTRICTS. (a) Equines. Number of stallions14 age, or being otherwise unsuitable for further retention on the strength of approved bulls. 36. The number of stud bulls supplied to dis- trict boards this year shows that steady progress is being maintained in district cattle breeding work. The department's extension programme was, however, greatly handicapped owing to the poor financial condi- tion of certain district boards, particularly in the barani areas, where the cattle-breeding industry suffered a severe set-back due to fodder famine. As a consequence, a number of bulls in excess of the demand at the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, which had been handled and were ready for issue in March 1930, had to be retained on the farm for a future issue. 37. The department had hoped to be able to help certain poor district boards outside the Dhanni and Hariana tracts, such as Dera Ghazi Khan, Jhang and Muzaffargarh, through a Government grant-in-aid, to enable them to distribute up to the minimum require- ments of bulls as decided in the five years' programme. A sum of Rs. 15,000 was proposed for this purpose, but the scheme had to be abandoned owing to financial stringency. 38. The majority of the district boards have come to realise the necessity for taking steps to protect the cattle-breeding industry against the indiscriminate letting loose of bulls in their districts for breeding; they have framed suitable bye-laws under sections 56 and 57 of the District Boards Act, which become operative after notification by Governnemt. The department, being anxious to make these bye-laws effective, is making every effort to stimulate interest in the villages. It is too soon to form any opinion of the effect of the intro- duction of these bye-laws in the villages; it will naturally depend on the thoroughness with which they will be enforced. Buffalo-breeding. 39. To meet the increasing demand for milk and ghee, buffalo-breeding is receiving special attention in certain well-defined areas throughout the province. A
15 good response has been made by certain district boards, such as Gujranwala, Sialkot, Amritsar and Gurdaspur, to help to increase the average milk yield of village buffaloes by creating keenness amongst local zamindars and by providing the necessary funds for the purchase of buffalo bulls where these are below the standard required. The department is experiencing the need of a Government buffalo-breeding farm from which issues of pedigree buffalo bulls can be made to districts. The Jalalabad area of Feroze pore District has hitherto furnished the requirements of the central districts for buffalo bulls. (c) Others. 40. There are indications, particularly in the Ferozepore District, of some revival of interest in the possibilities of the camel for agriculural purposes. To meet this demand, a scheme of subsidising specially selected privately owned camel stallions has been drawn up by the department and the necessary funds provided by the district board. The scheme is now in its second year and promises to give very satisfac- tory results. Efforts have been confined to a portion of the Abohar Tahsil, where there are now 10 camel stallions on subsidy work. Four hundred and twelve coverings have been registered against 340 in the previous year. There is great scope for expansion of this scheme in the Abohar Tahsil when the necessary funds and staff can be provided. Enquiries are also being conducted by the depart- ment into the possibilities of reviving camel-breeding in other suitable areas of the province as an aid to agriculture. Sheep-and Goat-breeding. 41. Government has extended its sanction to the supply of rams and ewes from the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, to approved breeders in hill districts at a concession rate, experimentally for 3 years. A similar scheme for the supply of merino sheep to Kangra Dis- trict only at a concession rate has been in force from
16 1928-29. During this year 190 rams and 70 ewes were supplied to bona fide zamindars in Kangra District, who own large numbers of sheep. In spite of the handicaps and difficulties owing to local conditions, the results of this scheme have so far been encouraging. The scheme has now reached a stage when, if it is vigorously pushed through and a sustained effort made for another 3 years, a very substantial and permanent improvement is likely to result. Owing to the shortage of staff in hill areas, it is difficult for the department to maintain the necessary close supervision required. 42. The starting of a self-contained sheep-breeding farm at Sambalpani in the Attock District was consider- ed, but the proposal had eventually to be abandoned on account of the difficulty in providing fodder during the months when no grazing is available. 43. Experience has definitely proved the unsuit- ability of the merino in the hands of the illiterate sheep- owner for improving the indigenous flocks of the plains districts. Only very hardy disease-resisting breeds of sheep, such as the indigenous breeds, can stand up to local conditions. The department will therefore, in future, pursue its policy of improving the indigenous breeds of the plains by selection and better feeding. 44. The goat herd on the Hissar Farm has not been sufficiently long established to be in a position to supply selected young male and female goats for distri- bution in the districts. There are, however, some short- ly reaching the age for issue which will be sold in select- ed areas. 5. CATTLE AND HOUSE FAIRS AND SHOWS. Fairs and shows17 (B) DISEASES AMONGST LIVE STOCK. 1. PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASES. 46. In the absence of any specific powers to pro- hibit the movements of infected live stock, the applica- tion of protective agents on a large scale, such as sera and vaccines, on which we are now entirely dependent in this country, cannot be said to be on a very sound basis. The one redeeming feature of the whole situation is that our indigenous breeds of live stock are noticeably disease-resistant and, with more adequate feeding, would suffer less mortality from such diseases as Rinderpest and H18 Hospitals. Number of.19 Building of veterinary hospitals. 51. Rs. 71,048 were allotted by Government as grants-in-aid, under specified condi- tions, to the undernoted district boards for the construction of vete- rinary hospitals in rural areas: Rs. 1.

Rinderpest. 58. Rinderpest appeared in all the districts of the province, except Simla and Mianwali. ft was particularly severe in the districts of Karnal, Kangra, Rohtak, Multan and Feroze- pore. Foot and Mouth disease. 59. The disease appeared in 23 districts, being most severe in Rohtak District. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia. 60. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia appeared in all dis- tricts, except Simla. This disease was responsible for heavy mortality in Sialkot and Amritsar Districts. Black Quarter. 61. This disease was reported from 12 districts of the province. The heaviest mortality took place in Sheikhupura Dis- trict. Anthrax. 62. Anthrax was confirmed from Sheikhupura and Gujrat Districts. The disease appeared in a subacute form. Other contagious diseases. 63. During the year under report contagious pleuro-pneumonia of goats, as well as other diseases of a contagious nature, occurred in 12 districts of the province. In view of the prevalence of Brucella infections in cattle and goats in this province, it is of interest to note here that contagious abortion in bovines caused by the Brucella abortus has now to be added to the list of animal diseases communicable to man, in whom it takes a form indistinguishable from Malta Fever22 that boiling of milk is a perfectly certain means of prevention; indeed a temperature much below the boiling-point can be relied upon to destroy the bacilli. (c) Other Animals. 64. The following diseases occurred amongst "Other Animals" of the province during the year:23 Inoculations against Anthrax. 70. Preventive inoculations against Anthrax were employed with good results in 3 out- breaks in the Sheikhupura. District and 34 animals were inoculated. 4. CASTRATIONS. 71. One lakh, seventy-nine thousand and fourteen castrations were performed on tour as compared with 170,424 during the previous year. One lakh, eighty-five thousand one hundred and seventy-seven castrations were performed in the veterinary hospitals against 160,465 in the preceding year. Veterinary Assistants have come to realise their responsibility for the carrying out of castration work in their areas. The response has been very satisfactory.
24 CHAPTER III.25 Hospital. 75. The attendance in the various wards of the hospital was as follows:26 Pressers' Course. 81. One candidate of Holkar's Mounted Escort, Indore, was trained in the Dressers Class during the summer vacation. Another from the Junagadh State was trained in the Dog Ward of the College from December 1929 to March 1930. Farrriers' Course. 82. Eighteen candidates joined the Farriers' Class in September 1929. Twenty-seven candidates of the previous year successfully completed the course during the year. 3. VETERINARY RESEARCH. Hygiene Section. 83. Investigations into the "milk supply of Lahore" are being carried out at the instance of the Board of Economic Inquiry, Punjab, under the supervision of the Professor of Hygiene. A preliminary investigation into the conditions of slaughter-houses in the province is also being made by this officer. Medicine Section. 84. A small laboratory has been equipped in the Medicine Section of the college in connection with the teaching of clinical diagnostics for the testing and analysis of urine. Electrolytic Chlorine is being manufactured in the Hospital Section of the college, which has proved satisfactory and economical for use in the clinic. Pathological Section. 85. The following work was done in the Patho- logical Laboratory:27 About 200 specimens were also examined during the year for external and internal parasites of animals and birds. Surra Section. 87. Three new methods of treatment of Surra were tried with a view to reduce the time taken, and the number of in- jections required, under the present system of treatment. Though the results obtained so far are satisfactory, nothing can be definitely said as the experiments were carried out on artificial Surra cases only. Arrange- ments are, however, being made to try these methods on natural Surra cases in the near future. Treatment according to 28 determined, the mortality from these diseases has been reduced by suitable preventive measures. The period from June 16th until September 16th, 1929, was spent by the Research Officer on special duty at the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar. During the months from June to September a fatal disease occurring amongst cattle and horses in the Sheikhupura and Gujrat Districts was investigated, and which proved to be an atypical form of Anthrax. A report was submitted, with photographs. Prophylactic measures were adopted which brought about a cessation of the outbreaks. Investigations were also carried out on Coccidiosis in cattle, which was prevalent in the Jhelum District. During the cold weather a number of visits were paid to Mr. Branford's farm at Lyallpur to determine the cause of abortion amongst his mares, and satis- factory tests were carried out in order to isolate affected animals. During the year periodic visits were paid to the Government Cattle Farm at Hissar in connection with outbreaks of disease. A large number of specimens and slides were sub- mitted by Veterinary Assistants in charge of the various hospitals in the Punjab. These were examined and reported upon. 4. DEMONSTRATION AND PROPAGANDA WORK . 91. During the year under report lectures were delivered by the subordinate veterinary staff at all the important horse and cattle fairs in the province. At the same time, simple hand-bills and pamphlets in the vernacular, dealing with contagious diseases of animals, were distributed. Lectures were also delivered to the rural uplift classes in schools and villages by members of the department in the course of their tours. Demonstrations by means of magic-lantern slides diagrams, charts and pathological specimens, as well as exhibits of live stock, were made at all the important horse and cattle fairs throughout the province.
29 Although progress has been made in these simple methods of propaganda, there is very great scope for further advance on the lines of practical addresses and demonstrations ; these could be carried out with greater effect with the aid of appropriate cinematograph films. District board meetings were also attended by the members of the department for discussing matters relating to the department. 92. Literary work done by the staff of the depart- ment.30 CHAPTER IV31 (b) Non-gazetted Staff. 94. The following additional staff was sanctioned during the year :32 CHAPTER V.33 CHAPTER VI. 1. PROGRESS MADE BY THE DEPARTMENT IN GIVING EFFECT TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE. (a) Sheep breeding. 96. One hundred and ninety cross-bred merino rams and 70 ewes were issued to breeders in the Kangra District at concession rates as against 70 rams last year. Government has, during the year, further extended, the scope of this concession to genuine breeders of all hill areas in the Province. The flock of Bikanir desert sheep recently established on the Hissar Farm will meet the demand for the issue of suitable rams in the plains districts. Sites for the starting of sheep-breeding farms in the Jhelum and Campbellpur Districts were inspected, but so far no suitable area for a self-contained farm in these hill districts has been selected. A preliminary investigation has been completed of the possibilities of developing the sheep breeding Indus- try in the Dera Ghazi Khan District. (b) Goat-breeding. 97. The flock of indigenous goats which was started on the Hissar Farm in 1928 is making satisfactory pro- gress. A number of male and female goats for issue to districts will shortly be available. (c) Cattle-breeding34 (e) Grants-in-aid. 100. Liberal grants-in-aid were given by Govern- ment for the encouragement of cattle-breeding the details of which are given elsewhere in this report. (f) Cattle Fairs and Shows. 101. The number has increased from 98 to 139 during this year. The department is making full use of these events to popularise its work in the villages. (g) Castrations. 102. Three lakhs, sixty-three thousand, nine hundred and ten castrations were performed as against 330,889 in the previous year. (h) Control of Live Stock Improvement. 103. The Live Stock Officer has been relieved of all administrative charge of district work, and has been made Assistant to the Director, Veterinary Services (for breeding) solely for the study of animal genetics and promoting schemes of cattle improvement. (i) Diseases of Live Stock and their Control. 104. Details of the department's activities are given elsewhere in this report. 2 . GENERAL REMARKS. 105. The reorganisation of the department, as well as the training of young officers are being effected with a minimum amount of interference to the general work. Only three of the five divisional offices have yet been opened ; it is hoped, however, that it will be possible to provide for a separate office at Multan in the near future. In these days, when the department's activities are rapidly expanding, the present strength of officers makes it extremely difficult to spare men for under- going courses of training. The lack of suitable provi- sion is regrettable as such courses are essential to the efficiency of a technical department. As usual, Commissioner's and Deputy Commissioners' sanads were awarded to zamindars in the different dis- tricts for special help rendered to the department.
35 The Director wishes to record his appreciation of the assistance received from all officers of the depart- ment. The names of the following Deputy Superintend- ents deserve special mention for their good work : [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Average Malwa Type of Bull taken at Moga, District Ferozepore.

DURING the year under report the Civil Veterinary Department, like all other departments, suffered from the financial stringency which has been brought on by the fall in the prices of agricultural produce. The de- partment, however, made considerable progress in its programme of improving the various breeds of live- stock, and of the prevention and cure of disease. 2. The Hissar Cattle Farm had a successful year, it increased its storage of fodder from 1,51,000 maunds to about 1,90,000 maunds, and produced 10,006 maunds of grain The number of bulls issued declined from 328 to 295 owing to financial difficulties of district boards. The Farm dairy recorded milk yield of 188 cows, No. 458 giving a yield of 7,364 lbs. or a daily yield of 33 lbs. The dairy is still in its infancy and promises to yield valuable results. Considerable progress has been made both in sheep and goat-breed- ing, and the Ministry trusts that yields of milk given by selected goats will be systematically recorded. 3. On the grantee cattle farms the Jahangirabad Farm is maintaining its reputation for enterprise and good work and cows giving less than 3,000 lbs. are now readily discarded. The average yield of milk during a lactation period on grantee farms has been in the neigh- bourhood of 6,000 lbs. Another notable development is the starting of a small buffalo berd on the Jahangir- abad Farm. 4. Cattle-breeding in the Hariana tract passed through an anxious time owing to the prolonged drought in the year 1939; but timely help given by Govern- ment in the way of fodder subsidies saved the stud bulls located in the areas most seriously affected. The need for economy has restricted the activities of the depart- ment in the Hariana and Dhanni Cattle-breeding tracts; but the work has been started on right lines, and the co- operation of breeders who have already seen the results, will undoubtedly help the continuance of this good work. The Ministry is watching with interest the
2 smaller schemes for the improvement of the breeding of cattle in all the districts of the province, for instance, the Dajal tract in Dera Ghazi Khan district, the Malwa breed in Ferozepore and Ludhiana districts, and in the area surrounding Jalalabad are all receiving attention. Lahore has been provided with 16 selected bulls. The situation is not very encouraging in Kangra; but even here an experiment has been started by the introduc- tion of 40 selected Montgomery bulls. The Ministry hopes that the Live-Stock Officer will start work in other districts also. It may be re-called that before the appointment of a Live-Stock Officer systematic cattle- breeding was confined to a few selected areas, and has been extended since to almost all districts. The appointment has justified itself. 5. The Army Remount Department has abandoned operations in the districts of Gujranwala and Dera Ghazi Khan. The latter was once one of the most famous dis- tricts in the Punjab for horse breeding, and in recognition of this fact the Army Remount Department has agreed to lend four horse stallions to the district for a period of two years as an experiment. 6. For the first time in the province the total number of animals treated in the veterinary hospitals passed the million mark; but, as the Director has point- ed out, it cannot be too often emphasized that the pre- vention and cure must go hand in hand. 7. During the year Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia came to the front as the most fatal disease among bovines. Surra was again treated with success; but the diffi- culty about providing accommodation during the brief summer season is likely to remain as long as district boards are suffering from the present financial depres- sion. Owing to a decrease in Rinderpest there was also a decrease in the number of Rinderpest inoculations per- formed; but there was a considerable increase in the number of vaccinations against Hæmorrhagic Septicæ- mia, the number rising from 205,000 last year to 243,000
3 8. The number of castrations again increased from 364,000 to 390,000. 9. The Veterinary College suffered in popularity as fewer posts could be provided for the qualified students of the College-18 posts, so far temporarily held by retired military men, were available for qualified candi- dates. Valuable research work, however, was carried out in connection with various more or less obscure cattle diseases which prevailed in the province. 10. On the whole, in spite of the financial string- ency, the department is to be congratulated on a success- ful year's work. Seventeen new veterinary hospitals were added during the year, making a total of 287, giving a hospital to about 180 villages; and the demand for opening more hospitals is urgent. The department is fortunate in that it has won the confidence of the people; which increases its opportunities of usefulness. The thanks of the Ministry are due to the Director and to the officers of the Veterinary Department for the admirable results achieved during the year under report.

S., Director, Veterinary Services, Punjab. CHAPTER I.2 CHAPTER II.-Live Stock. (A) BREED1NG OPERATIONS. 1.3 Live Stock. 6. During the year under report, the issue of live stock for breeding purposes to Punjab zamindars and district boards included 295 bulls, 120 rams, 32 male goats and 3 horse stallions. These figures are low as compared with those for the last year, but this is due to the prevailing financial stringency. Cattle breeding. 7. Eleven hundred and fifteen calves were born during the year as against 957 in the previous year. Practically no grazing was available prior to the Monsoon during the first 3 months of the year, April, May and June, and, therefore, almost all the stock had to be stall-fed, which resulted in the consumption of a good deal of reserve fodder, necessitating also the purchase of a certain amount of grain in the open market after exhausting the farm reserves. Ensilage made from a very prolific local grass called 'Bur' when cut at the proper time gave very encouraging results from feeding it to the young stock. To enable the stock to graze before the sun gets too hot in the middle of the day, they were all released from their night shelters at 4-30 A.M., and encouraged to lie up in the shade during the heat of the day. The rains of June, July and August provided ample grazing until the end of the year. Consequently stall feeding, except to the dairy cows and bulls was entirely dispensed with. Hay-making operations started on the 22nd August and were continued until late in November. 36,133 maunds were collected against 3,058 maunds in the previous year, representing a very considerable addition to the reserves of the Farm. Dairying at the Hissar Cattle Farm. 8. During the year under report the milk yield of 188 cows was systematically recorded, out of which 59 cows gave over 2,000 pounds of milk per lactation. The year's results show that these can be classified as follows :4 The following statement shows the milk yield of some of the cows of this special herd :5 Goat breeding. 11. Contagious abortion has broken out among the goat herd, bringing breeding operations for the present more or less to a stand- still. The progeny are well up to breeding standards and are likely to justify the expense incurred in starting this herd. Stud goats were issued for breeding to districts as shown below:6 Contagious abortion. 15. (a) Donkeys.7 (7) The facilities for an investigation into sterility in cattle are about to be exploited by one of the Veterinary Officers of the Farm. Preliminary arrangements have been made. (8) Exact information is being sought as to the first oc- currence of Oestrum amongst Farm-bred heifers. (9) The viability of the Anthrax bacillus after fixation and staining by the ordinary methods was tested with in- teresting results. The latter would appear to show that the ordinary fixation and staining of Anthrax blood smears does not eliminate the danger of human infection from such slides Fodder. 17. The following table shows the receipts of grain and fodder from the cultivation and the Bir:8 The water supply from the Western Jumna Canal during the year under report was one of the worst ever experienced. Each full supply turn was several days short and the water was often deficient in height giving poor command. This resulted in a smaller acreage of crops than was anticipated, while the quality and yield have also been badly affected; grain and bhusa being much below average. Fodder Reserve. 18. The total reserve at the end of the year was 190,664 maunds as against 151,993 maunds in the previous year9 Fire. 22. Fire broke out in the Bir on 9 occasions during the year under report, which is a big in- crease on previous years. The Deputy Commissioner, Hissar, has issued orders through the lambar- dars of the surrounding villages to instruct the villagers to refrain from smoking or dropping lighted matches, biris or other inflammable materials when passing through the Gov- ernment Bir. The time wasted in having to deal with these fires is costly, apart from the loss of valuable grazing. General. 23. (a) Investigations of certain diseases are in progress and their results are being keenly watched. (b) Several petty improvements in the Farm buildings the completion of which would have made for greater efficiency on the Farm, had to be held over for want of funds. (c) The Farm maintains two workshops, one at Mundi- anwala and the other at the Home Farm, for the repairs to Farm machinery, tools, plant and rolling stock, etc. The output of work was satisfactory. (d) Instructional classes for cattle theft police on the branding of cattle, and for syces in the care and manage- ment of district board stallions were provided during the year. (e) A long beam with a. special attachment was fixed to the body of the Punjab plough, which has been found most successful. A plough of this kind was supplied for trial to each of the Remount Depôts at Mona and Babugarh. (f) Owing to the difficulty in producing indelible tat- tooing marks on the ears of cattle it was found necessary to abandon this method of identification of cattle against cattle theft pending further investigation into the possibilities of tattooing. Investigational work is now in progress on the Farm. (g) The existing Co-operative Societies are making satis- factory progress. 2.10 details of the number of stock on these farms at the end of the year under report:11 Shergarh small holders' grants. 25. These grants consist of 218½ rectangles of 7 chaks, Nos. 2012 3.13 Seven one-day village cattle shows were held in selected parts of the Rohtak district during the year and a sum of Rs. 1,600 was awarded in cash prizes to owners of selected cows, bulls and young stock. These shows are now being steadily organised in this district during the past 4 years in order to encourage and sti- mulate interest amongst local breeders. The Rohtak District Board is quite enthusiastic over this system of propaganda. I can conceive of no better method of rousing interest amongst the local zamindars or carrying on other Departmental propaganda than these small village shows. It is unfortunate that owing to financial stringency, it was impossible to hold similar shows in the Hissar and Gurgaon districts. I have consistently advocated that it is money well spent by Government in supporting these shows. (b) Dhanni Tract. 28. The following statement shows the allotments made and the expenditure incurred by the district boards of Attock, Rawalpindi, Jhelum. Shahpur and Mianwali districts towards the Dhanni Cattle Improvement Scheme :14 propaganda amongst the people showing the interest taken by the district boards and the department in the encourage- ment of their local cattle-breeding industry. The number of bulls supplied this year as well as the total number of approved bulls now working in the districts in the Dhanni Tract are shown in the statement below15 (c) Other Tracts. (1) Montgomery District Cattle Breeding Scheme. 29. The scheme was started in the area of Kue-ki-Baha- wal Zail of Dipalpur tahsil last year. Through the gene- rosity of the proprietor, Jahangirabad Farm, 9 more Mont- gomery bulls were given, free of cost, and concentrated in this area. These bulls are very popular in the tract, and there is a demand for more. The results of the scheme are quite promising, the more so because the local zemindars are naturally interested in cattle breeding. (2) Nili Bar Cattle Breeding Scheme. 30. This scheme has not been started on account of financial stringency. The land earmarked for the Nili Bar Farm has, therefore, been given out on temporary leases for cultivation purposes. (3) Dajjal Village Cattle Breeding Scheme. 31. This scheme was prepared and discussed at length. Muzaffargarh district does not offer much scope for productive expenditure, and it was thought inadvisable to proceed with the scheme there. In Dera Ghazi Khan district, however, it is possible to do some good and this possibility is receiving attention. (4) Malwa Cattle Breeding Scheme, 32. The scheme for the resuscitation of the Malwa breed of cattle within Ferozepore and Ludhiana districts has made good progress during the year. There are now 76 ap- proved bulls working in this tract, with 3 big centres, namely, Moga, Jagraon and Raikot. In addition 28 selected locally- bred Malwa bulls have also been let loose by local zamindars with the approval of this Department, under sections 56 and 57 of the Punjab District Boards Act. This concentration of good bulls in a more or less confined area should have a very appreciable effect on the standard of the local cattle within a period of a few years. Our local officers report a compara- tively heavy drainage of good cows out of the tract through cattle dealers on account of agricultural depression. The matter is being discussed with the District Boards concerned. (5) Jalalabad Cattle Breeding Scheme. 33. In Ferozepore district in the vicinity of Jalal- abad, which is on the border of the Sahiwal tract, the local cattle possess the same characters as and are closely related to the Sahiwal breed. In order to improve the cattle of this
16 area, nine Montgomery bulls have been recently located there at the request of the local inhabitants. There is also a big demand for Montgomery heifers from this tract, which the Department is doing its best to meet. (6) Kangra District Cattle Breeding Scheme. 34. In Kangra district amongst the more enlighten- ed classes, there is a pressing demand for a better milk supply because the local hill cattle are such poor milkers. With a view, therefore, to improving the milk yield of the locally-bred cattle, 40 bulls of Montgomery breed of small size were introduced into the district in March 1930 and 2 others this year through the generosity of the proprietor of the Jahangirabad Cattle Farm, who supplied them free of cost. In order to encourage interest in milk production as a local industry, 29 Montgomery heifers from the Jahangirabad Farm were also distributed to cattle-breeding societies at nominal prices, in addition to 17 already working in the dis- trict. These operations are in the experimental stage and are being watched with interest by the Department. Kangra district and other hill areas, where there is a heavy rainfall and a comparatively slow growth of natural grasses on the hill sides within reach of the villages, provide their own peculiar problems in stock improvement. The pressure on the available cultivated area from the steadily increasing human population is such that the cattle are de- pendent entirely on grazing for their subsistence. In their anxiety to cultivate every available inch of ground, the people maintain large herds of cattle for their manure. The latter must, in order to survive, be small enough to be able to draw a maintenance ration out of the available grazing by fending for themselves during the months of the year when this is feasible. Sufficient, therefore, has been said to show that there is only very limited scope for interference in the local cattle raising conditions. (7) Improvement of Cattle and Buffalo breeding in Lahore district. 35. During the year, 16 more bulls were supplied to the selected area in Lahore district. Twenty-five privately-owned bulls belonging to local zamindars, the progeny of our Hissar District Board bulls, have also been selected and approved for breeding purposes in the villages of the tract to supplement the services of the existing District Board bulls.
17 One hundred buffalo bulls, the property of local zamin- dars, have also been selected and approved for breeding pur- poses in the area. As I noted in last year's report there is a very noticeable improvement in the quality of the local cattle as the result of the Department's bull distribution scheme. A visit to the Kahna Kacha annual cattle fair is instructive, for there one sees large numbers of the progeny of District Board bulls, testifying to the prepotency of the Hissar Farm pedigree bulls. 4.18 (b) Bovines. Stud Bulls19 (c) Others. Camel-breeding. 42. With the revival of interest in the possibilities of the camel for agricultural purposes, the Camel Breeding Scheme in Ferozepore district is showing evidence of use- ful work. The District Board, Ferozepore, with its limited provision for this purpose, subsidised 10 camels (the same number as last year). Four hundred and four coverings have been checked against 401 in the previous year. The scheme is now in its third year and paucity of funds is its greatest disadvantage. The scheme has decided pos- sibilities in the Abohar tahsil of Ferozepore district provided sufficient funds are available to help the industry with the supply of good camel stallions. Sheep and Goat Breeding. 43. The Department's scheme for the supply of 3/4 merino sheep to Kangra district at a concession rate has now been in force since 1928-29. During this year 120 rams and 20 ewes were supplied to bona fide zamindars owning large flocks of sheep, compared to 190 rams and 70 ewes sup- plied last year. The difficulties under which the local sheep breeding industry is conducted are such that it requires a very hardy and robust sheep to compete with the indigenous breed. The introduction of the merino has, therefore, a limited sphere of usefulness in the flocks of breeders who are interested in producing a finer type of wool to meet special requirements. Propaganda for the grading up by selection of the local indi- genous breeds is being carried on side by side with the De- partment's other work. 44. In the Malwa tract comprising Ferozepore and Ludhiana districts where the short-ear type of sheep nearly related to the Bikaner breed is met with, the Department's touring staff are keeping close touch with the owners of local flocks, who are nomads belonging to the "Od" tribe. They own flocks in hundreds and thousands and conse- quently sheep breeding in the Malwa tract is undoubtedly a very important industry. Fazilka, where these people assemble for the shearing of their sheep, is the most important market for wool in the Punjab. The Department in this area carries out large numbers of castrations amongst the local flocks by the Italian method which is now very popular among breeders. C2
20 5.21 Work of veterinary hospitals. 48. The total number of animals treated in the veteri- nary hospitals was 1,026,512 against 934,795 during the previous year. In addition, 146,530 cases against 125,721 last year were supplied with medicine, but were not brought to the hospitals. The steady increase in the number of cases treated at our veterinary hospitals is very satisfactory showing that the Department is steadily gaining the con- fidence of the people in veterinary aid. The Department, however, insists that its staff must regard the control of con- tagious diseases and the improvement of the live stock of their ilaqas as their major activities. Outlying dispensaries. 49. This scheme is now in its fourth year and is making steady progress. Zamindars of the more remote areas are deriving considerable benefit from the facilities which are now provided at these dispensaries by seeking the advice and services of our veterinary staff at regular intervals. Constant demands for the starting of permanent dispen- saries in the areas served by these outlying dispensaries are being received by the Department, but unfortunately they cannot be met at present on account of financial stringency. Building of veterinary hospitals. 50. No grant-in-aid for the construction of veterinary buildings in rural areas was sanctioned by Government on account of financial stringency. Simla Veterinary Hospi- tal. 51. The Simla Veterinary Hospital is maintained out of provincial funds through the agency of the Simla Municipality. The receipts and expenditure of this hospital during the year under report were Rs. 11,402 and 7,771 against Rs. 12,226, and Rs. 8,808, respectively during the previous year. This represents a decrease of Rs. 825 and Rs. 1,088 in both income and expenditure respectively. The surplus income amounting to Rs. 3,631-5-8 was credited into the Government treasury by the Simla Municipality. Considering that the busy period is confined to the season, this represents quite a satisfactory year's working. As noted in last year's report, there was an insistent de- mand for better facilities at this hospital which has resulted in the formation of a public fund by an influential committee
22 for the purpose of defraying expenses in providing an opera- ting theatre which is so badly needed for an important hos- pital of this kind. A sum of over rupees four thousand has already been subscribed towards acquiring a suitable site near the veterinary hospital. It is expected that the required amount will soon be subscribed enabling final arrangements to be made. Treatment of diseases in villages, Table IV. 52. Forty-one thousand and sixty-six villages were visited by the district staff on tour and 289,008 animals were treated as com- pared with 41,779 villages and 304,212 animals during the previous year. 2.23 As far as possible, preventive measures were taken to stop the further spread of the disease. Surra. 55. The undernoted Surra centres were at work during the last Surra season :24 (b) Bovines. Rinderpest. 56. Rinderpest appeared in all the districts of the pro- vince, except Simla and Montgomery. It was particularly severe in the Sheikhu- pura district. Muzaffargarh, Gujrat, Hissar and Gujranwala districts also showed a fairly considerable incidence of this disease, notwithstanding the comparative immunity of the province generally. With the increased net-work of hospitals, the Department is getting into closer touch with the actual disease incidence of the country. Foot and Mouth disease. 57. The disease appeared in 23 districts of the province being most severe in Rohtak and Muzaffargarh. The use of taramira oil as a dressing for mouth lesions and tar oil for foot cases are gaining in popularity. Both remedies are cheap and easily obtainable in the local bazaars. Hæmorrhagic Septi- cæmia. 58. This disease appeared in all the districts of the province, except Simla. It was res- ponsible for fairly considerable mortality in Amritsar, Sheikhupura, Shahpur, Montgomery, Gurdaspur and Hoshiarpur districts. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia is a disease associated with water-logged low-lying areas where also parasitic diseases of stock are rife. The mortality would have been very severe during this year but for the intervention of sera and vaccines in the well-known Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia areas. Black quarter. 59. This disease was reported from 20 districts of the province. The heaviest mortality took place in the Attock, Jhelum and Rawal- pindi districts. The regional distribu- tion of this disease is of considerable interest. Anthrax. 60. Cases of this disease were confirmed from the Sheikhupura district only. Other contagious disea- ses. 61. During the year under report, other diseases of a contagious nature occurred in 9 districts of the province. (c) Other animals. 62. The following diseases occurred amongst other animals. Rinderpest, Foot and Mouth Disease, Trypano- somiasis, rabies and Ranikhet disease.
25 (3) PREVENTIVE INOCULATION. Anti-rinderpest inocula- tion. 63. Anti-rinderpest inoculations were performed in 382 outbreaks and 92,856 cattle were inoculated against 517 outbreaks and 97, 846 inoculations in the previous year. Eighty-two animals died after inoculation. These were probably in the incubative stage of the disease at the time of inoculation. Inoculations against Hæmorrhagic Septicæ- mia. 64. Preventive serum inoculations against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia were performed in 548 out- breaks and 130,997 animals were in- oculated as compared with 482 out- breaks and 113,752 inoculations done last year. Preventive vaccinations against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia. 65. Vaccinations against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia were performed on 205,210 animals in 1,200 villages of 28 districts against 243,689 animals in the same number of villages of 27 districts during the previous year. The highest number of vaccinations (17,125) was carried out in the Lyallpur district. The volume of work done in the employment of sera and vaccines by the Depart- ment's staff is very considerable. Vaccinations against Black quarter. 66. Vaccinations were performed on 21,420 animals in 151 villages of 11 districts against 19,083 animals in 120 villages and 12 districts during the previous year. Inoculations against Anthrax. 67. No inoculation was done in the year under report as the one outbreak was brought under control by other prophylactic measures. 4.26 CHAPTER III.27 Hospital. 72. The attendance in the various wards of the hospital was as follows :28 Training in Surra treat- ment. 77. Fifteen Veterinary Assistants and Veterinary Assistant Surgeons as well as 23 students of the final class of the Punjab Veteri- nary College were trained by Deputy Superintendent S. Kahan Singh at Sheikhupura in Surra treatment. Dressers' Course. 78. Three candidates joined the Dressers' class, of whom two have since completed the course successfully. Farriers' Course. 79. Twenty-seven candidates joined the Earrers' Class during the year. Twenty-eight men completed the course and were given the necessary certificates. 3.29 Investigations have also been undertaken in the chemo- therapy of a serious canine fever attended with heavy losses among English-bred dogs. The arseno-benzene series of drugs have been given an exhaustive trial, of which sulpharsenol has been the most promising, particularly when administered in the early stages of the disease. Considerable work has also been done concerning the etiology of this disease which is still in progress. Parasitology Section. 82. Three hundred and four specimens of materials from animals and birds suspected to be suffering from parasitic diseases were examined during the year under report, and those found infected from among animals attending the clinic were given suitable treatment. The experimental treatment of equine intestinal Strongylosis started last year with tetra chlorethylene was continued this year with oleum chenopodium and thymol but no definite results as to their success or otherwise can be given at present. Anatomy Section. 83. The Professor of Anatomy, in addition to his ordi- nary teaching duties, prepared some dissected specimens for the Anatomical Museum, macerated some fractured and pathological specimens of bones for the general Museum, hospital and Pathological Sections. He is also finally revising the conclusions arrived at in regard to measurements of the viscera of Indian-bred ponies, an enquiry which was taken in hand in 1925 and is now nearing completion. He has also prepared special notes on osteology and arthrology of the ox for the guidance of students including his observations in the structural variations met with in the ordinary course of dissection work. Examinations of patho- logical specimens at Superintendent's head- quarters. 84. Sixty-nine specimens were received from the subordinate veterinary staff. Other Research work done by the Research Offi- cer in the field. 85. In the early part of the year 1930, a survey was begun of those diseases which occur with more or less annual sequence in the low-lying area of the Deg Nullah. Periods of occurrence, types of animals affected, preven- tion of occurrence and spread were investigated. The diseases included Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, Rinderpest, Foot and Mouth disease, Anthrax, skin diseases and parasitic diseases.
30 A visit was paid to the Kulu Valley to study a disease among cattle which occurs annually at more or less definite periods of the year; a hæmaturia, which not infrequently has a fatal termination. Two attacks are usually necessary before death intervenes. At the time of this visit the disease was not very prevalent but certain material was collected for patholo- gical examination. Owing to the religious susceptibility of the people, the investigation was hampered in not having the opportunity to destroy and make post-mortems on some of the affected animals. This was important, as it would have afforded most useful information. The opinion was held locally that the condition was due to certain grasses but examination of these did not yield any useful results. Blood, urine and fæces were all carefully examined. The investigation is being continued. A preliminary tour was made in the villages of the Karnal district in order to ascertain the prevalence of Trypanosomiasis and Piroplasmosis in cattle as possible complicating factors in the carrying out of the serum-simultaneous method in Rinderpest. The prevalence of coccidia was also being in- vestigated which, according to Dr. Edwards' statement (late of the Muktesar Institute), "cattle in India harbour in the lining of their bowels and which are tolerated without visible inconvenience unless they become resuscitated under certain conditions and cause trouble." These are all very practical questions which need enquiry, their investigation is being continued. As opportunity occurs work is being carried out on Rani khet disease of poultry as well as a disease of buffaloes in the Deg Nullah, a form of dry gangrene which affects the animals' extremities. A disease of cattle and horses occurring in parts of the Sheikhupura district and which was causing serious mortality was found after careful investigation to be an a-typical form of anthrax. Steps have now been taken to prevent recurrence. 4.31 Lectures were delivered to the Rural Uplift Classes in schools and villages by members of the Department in the course of their tours. Demonstrations by means of magic lantern slides, dia- grams, charts and pathological specimens as well as exhibits of live stock were made at all the important horse and cattle fairs throughout the province. Literary work done by the staff of the Depart- ment. 87. Mr. Aggarwala of the Punjab Veterinary College wrote an article on "Wounds and their treatment" for the Journal of the "National Horse Breeding Society of India" and another article in Hindi on 'Milking' for the Cow number of the Hindi Journal "Bhakti" from Rewari, district Gurgaon. As recognition for his publication "The Art of Milking" referred to in last year's report, Mr. Aggarwala was awarded a Bronze Medal by the Academie Veterinaire de France. In addition to the above, several articles containing useful information on cattle diseases were contributed by different members of the department to the Punjab Veterinary Journal. Popular veterinary leaflets on Rinderpest, Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and Foot and Mouth have been prepared for dis- tribution to districts by Khan Sahib Khawaja Ghulam Hasan, Deputy Superintendent, Lahore, as part of the rural propa- ganda which is being carried out by the Department against the present haphazard methods of dealing with contagious diseases.

VETERINARY RESEARCH AT THE PUNJAB VETERINARY COLLEGE, LAHOREReview of the Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, for the year 1931-32. It is satisfactory to find that in this year of finan- cial difficulties there has been little or no falling off in the efficiency of the Provincial Veterinary Services. The work done by this department which is apt to pass un- noticed by the public may be considered under three heads:2 that should a satisfactory method of tattooing be evolved, the task of the cattle-thief may be rendered con- siderably more difficult. In spite of economic depres- sion the sales of stock for breeding purposes increased in almost all sections during the year. out of the 91 dairy cows, whose lactation was recorded during the year, only 27 produced less than 2,000 lbs. of milk; while 3 produced 4,000 one 5,000 and one 6,000. The Arab horse-breeding section has been closed down. There has been a certain amount of contagious abortion more par- ticularly among goats, and an investigation into the outbreak is in progress in collaboration with the staff of the Veterinary College, Lahore. The expansion scheme, which was undertaken some years ago, is now complete in all important details with the result that the farm is now for the first time self-supporting in grain as well as in fodder. This result has been achieved twelve months earlier than was expected. In future the farm may be in a position to grow some paying crops and derive revenue therefrom in order to reduce the gap between income and expenditure Towards the end of the year at the request of the Legislative Council a committee was set up to investigate the affairs of the farm from the economic point of view. Their report is now under consideration. There can be no doubt that this farm is doing most valuable work for the pro- vince. 3. During the year the post of Live Stock Officer was placed in abeyance as a measure of retrenchment and the superintendence of breeding operations reverted to Divisional Superintendents. District breeding work can be considered under three heads:3 a lactation are common, and unsatisfactory cows are steadily being eliminated. The Director, Veterinary Services, reports that constant supervision is necessary to prevent the grantees relaxing into slipshod methods of breeding, which would defeat the objects of the grants altogether. The two most important special tracts in which cattle breeding is being encouraged are the Hariana and the Dhanni. In Hissar, Rohtak and Gurgaon efforts are being made to establish an improved stock of Hariana cattle and similar steps are being taken for the Dhanni breed in the districts of Attock, Rawalpindi, Jhelum, Shahpur and Mianwali. In both these tracts the work is at present handicapped by shortage of funds in the coffers of the district boards concerned. In order to timulate these activities one-day cattle shows with distribution of small prizes would be useful, but for these money is required. Progress is also being made with cattle breeding schemes in the Montgomery district, the Malwa tract, the Lahore district and in Kangra. The proposal to found cattle farms in the Nili Bar has not been proceeded with owing to the prevailing stringency. The land earmarked for the purpose is on temporary cultivation at present. A proposal to set up a buffalo breeding farm in part of this land under private manage- ment is under consideration of Government. 4. Operations on grantee farms and in special tracts cannot influence the province as a whole unless the example afforded by them affects cattle breeding methods in the province as a whole. The ordinary work of the veterinary officer in every district of the province should include a practical interest in the breeding of horses, cattle, buffaloes, camels, sheep and goats. The Civil Veterinary Department is largely relieved of their responsibility for horse-breeding by the extensive operations in that direction carried on by the Army Remount Department in selected districts. But there are still 70 horse and pony stallions and 87 donkey stallions supervised by the department. The number of district board stud bulls in the various districts rose from 3,520 to 3,857. The system of issue of stud bulls from the Cattle Farm at Hissar is one of the items which were referred to the committee mentioned in paragraph 2 above, and their recommendations will have the careful consideration of Government. At pre-
4 sent district boards seem disinclined to find the money required to pay the very moderate prices assessed on these bulls, and Government is faced ith the necessity of feeding larger numbers of bulls on the farm than true economy would c ntemplate. The districts want bulls and plenty of bulls are available. It is merely a ques- tion of finding a suitable solution. Up to date buffalo breeding has not received the attention which it de- serves. A fine example has been set during the year by Guru Partap Singh of Bheri Sahib who has offered to give annually free of cost all mature male stock bred at his farm and declared fit for breeding purposes by the department to the District Board, Ludhiana, for the improvement of the local breed of buffaloes. Camel breeding is being encouraged in the Fazilka and Mukt- sar Tahsils of Ferozepore district; but sufficient money is not available at present. The supply of three quarter merino sheep from the Hissar Cattle Farm to the Kangra district continues. The department is keeping in close touch with the shepherds at Fazilka, which is one of the most important wool markets in the Punjab. 5. Every effort is being made to grapple with the important question of the prevention of contagious dis- eases. A conference was recently held at Dharamsala with a view to find methods of concerted action to pre- vent the spread of contagious diseases between the Mandi, Bilaspur and Suket States and the neighbouring districts of the Punjab. The total reported mortality from contagious diseases in the year rose from 17,628 to 24.220. Among cattle hæmorrhagic septicæmia was responsible for about 47 per cent. of the total mortality. Rinderpest, which occurred particularly in Lahore, Gujranwala and Sheikhupura districts, was next in importance. At the various surra stations in the pro- vince 2,641 horses and camels were created during the year as compared with 1,925 in the previous year. This dis- ease is restricted mostly to the districts of Sheikhupura, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Rohtak and Karnal. The depart- ment undertakes anti rinderpest inoculations and inocul- ations and preventive vaccinations against hæmrorrhagic septicæmia. 6. Towards the end of the year a committee investi- gated the affairs of the Punjab Veterinary College; and were satisfied that on the whole the college was econo-
5 mically administered. Some minor economies, which are expected to result in the saving of Rs. 3,881 annual- ly, have been introduced. Apart from the teaching work for which this college has always been held in high esteem valuable research work is constantly being carried on; while useful demonstrations and propagenda with lectures on veterinary science are arranged for at all important horse and cattle fairs in the province. Financial stringency has unfortunately materially affect- ed the prospects of diplomates. There is at present no outlet for them except into the ranks of the Veterinary Department and these ranks are not at the moment expanding. It is to be hoped that municipal commit- tees and district boards will realise the value of this material for meat and milk inspection, hackney carriage inspection and other such work. Similarly, diplomates of the Lahore Veterinary College are very well fitted to serve as inspectors under the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The meat and milk inspection course at the Veterinary College is probably as thorough as any available elsewhere and it is hoped that local bodies when making fresh appointments to such posts will appreciate the fact. Mr. Quirke held the post of Director, Veterinary Services, throughout the year and the thanks of the Ministry are due to him and to his officers for the satis- factory way in which their duties were performed.

Director, Veterinary Services, Punjab. Director, Veterinary Sci vices, Punjab. CHAPTER I.CHAPTER II-Live Stock. A.8 ambs, 46 ewes and female lambs and 28 male goats. These figures show that, in spite of agricultural depression, the sales for breeding purposes have increased in almost all sections, as compared with the figures for the previous year. Cattle-breeding Section. 8. One thousand, four hundred and thirty-six calves were born during he year compared with 1,115 in the previous year. The method of grazing of stock early in the morning, as com- menced last year, proved such a success that the practice has been continued again this year. The bulls purchased from Rohtak District for use on the Farm have produced excellent stock. The District Board has again been approached to continue this method of exchange with the Superintendent of the Farm. Since January 1932, all calves born on the Farm have been weighed in order to determine the average weight at birth. Upto 31st March 1932, 379 calves were weighed. The maximum weight observed was 72 lbs. and minimum 40 lbs. The average weight of newly born calves in the main herd is 57 lbs. It is proposed to experiment on animals which are other- wise normal, but do not come, or are late in coming, into season, with the urine of pregnant animals which according to recent research possesses the necessary hormones for the stimulation of fertility. Dairy Section. 9. The Section has milk recorded 623 cows since its in- ception. During the year under report 91 dairy cows completed their lactation and are classified as below:4 The owing follstatement shows the milk yield of some of the cows of this special herd:5 ment. There are now some excellent stud rams, which have been bred on the Farm. Local breeders appear to realize the usefulness of this desert sheep. Goat-breeding Section. 12. The goat breeding was seriously retarded by an outbreak of disease caused by Br. melitensis and Br. abortus. All the goats underwent biological tests, as a result of which the reactors, and the goats which had aborted, were disposed of. The zamindars appear to appreciate the usefulness of our male stock, as 28 were issued for breeding purposes during the year to the following districts:6 Contagious Abortion. 16. (a) Cattle.7 Fodder Section. 18. The following table shows the out put of grain and fodder from the cultivation of the Bir :8 Experiments on fodder crops. 21. Experiments were continued with Sun-flower, Salt- bush, Irungu cholam, Gowara. A seed rate experiment for oats was also carried out. The results are being tabulated. The Bir. 22. Grazing in the Bir was exhausted in April 1931 and stall feeding had to be resorted to, until the arrival of the monsoon, which was rather late, but some very good grasses came up, and whatever anjan was available was of very good quality. Hay making was in progress from the 24th August 1931 until the 25th January 1932, and 43,476 maunds of good hay and ensilage, mostly anjan, were made. Also 11 maunds and 17 seers of anjan grass seed were collected. On account of the lateness of the rains, a lot of good green anjan was avail- able after the silo pits had been filled, so an experiment in the stack method of ensilage was carried out. This had not been previously undertaken on the Farm. The results of this experiment are most encouraging, for when the stacks were opened, some five months after making, the ensilage was consumed with avidity by the cattle. All issues from the stack are being made by weight so that the Farm can arrive at the loss by shrinkage, etc., with regard to this form of ensilage. Only 2,728 maunds of Palla was made this year. The crop was a poor one owing to the late rains, and the sudden cessation of the monsoon followed by a long dry spell at the time of seeding. General. 23. (a) Investigations of certain diseases are in progress and their results are being keenly watched. (b) During the year under report an implement shed 50 long, of a cheap Pusa pattern, was erected at Mundianwala. Owing to lack of funds it was found necessary to keep several urgent projects in abeyance. (c) Publications.9 (e) Valuable tattooing investigational work was further extended. A batch of heifers varying in age from 9 months to 2 years was tattooed for identification purposes. A second batch of cows and bullocks of all ages was also tattooed with various inks in March 1930. The numbers tattooed contained from 2 to 4 digits. All these animals have been treated as the rest of the herd, without any preferential treatment. Observations have been recorded from time to time. The results achieved are en- couraging, and hold out definitely a hopeful future. 2.10 commercial lines, and to carry out generally the recom- mendations of the Department. During the year under re- port Government approved the maintenance of 40 buffaloes and 1 buffalo bull of pure breed at this Farm without in any way affecting any condition of the existing lease, with the exception of the latter part of condition 16. Out of the above, 19 buffaloes and one bull have since been approved by the Department. The remaining 21 buffaloes will be made good by the grantee in the year 1932-33. Shergarh Small Holders' Grants. 25. These grants consist of 218½ rectangles of 7 chaks, Nos. 20-26 I. A. L. near Shergarh. The present grantees are required to keep 2 Montgomery cows for each rectangle of 25 acres irrigated, and 1 cow for every rectangle un- irrigated, to the satisfaction of the Department. The position, with regard to the disposal of the milk on a co-operative basis, was discussed by the Live Stock Officer with the grantees, representatives of the Co-operative Department and many others. Enquiries made showed that there was no desire to sell surplus milk by the grantee as it was all needed by their families. Dairying at Grantee Farms. 26. Milk is being recorded on all the grantee farms as hitherto. There is a considerable number of good milkers. On the Jahangirabad and Allahdad Farms, many of their cows are yielding over 4,000 pounds of milk in a lactation. Cows giving an unsatisfactory quantity of milk are being steadily eliminated. The following details of cows yielding over 6,000 pounds in a lactation on the two farms referred to above are given :11 Number of cows. Number of days. Total milk yield. Number of lactation.

The above two farms are supplying cream to the Military Dairy Farm, Lahore Cantonment. The Montgomery Dairy Farm and the Bahadurnagar Farm are selling their milk in Montgomery and Okara, respectively. General remarks. 27. The grantees have not yet acquired sufficient ap- preciation of the elaborate arrangements needed for building up pedigree stock, and, but for departmental supervision they would very readily revert to slipshod methods, as being justifiable in these days of agricultural depression. This tendency has to be combated on all these farms. It discloses a regrettable lack of foresight in dealing with live stock improvement. 3.12 The number of bulls supplied and the total number of approved bulls now working in the three districts of the Hariana Scheme are as follows :13 Dhanni Tract are shown in the statement below. It shows an increase of 76 stud bulls at the end of the year :14 (2) NILI BAR CATTLE-BREEDING SCHEME. 31. This scheme has not yet been inaugurated on ac- count of paucity of funds. The land earmarked for the farm has, therefore, been given out on temporary leases for cultiva- tion purposes. (3) DAJAL VILLAGE CATTLE-BREEDING SCHEME. 32. A special scheme for the improvement of the Dhundi estate in Dera Ghazi Khan District has recently been evolved, and its preliminaries are being arranged. Owing to financial difficulties, the Dajal Village Cattle Breeding Scheme could not be extended. (4) MALWA CATTLE-BREEDING SCHEME. 33. During the year under report accurate survey of the present position, and authoritative definition of the distinc- tive characteristics of the Malwa breed was completed. There are now 247 District Board Hissar bulls working in the Malwa tract with big centres at Moga, Jagraon and Raikot. A fourth centre has also been created at Ghal in Ferozepore Tahsil, by the location of 15 bulls. In addition to these bulls, there are 698 locally bred Malwa bulls liberated by the local zamindars, with the approval of the Department, under sections 56 and 57 of the Punjab District Boards Act. The Malwa breed constitutes the basis of a large number of the best milking and draught animals of the Malwa tract, so it is a matter of great concern when it is realized that the best specimen cows in considerable numbers are now being exported to other provinces of India, through the agency of dealers. The necessity for the immediate protection of this highly specialized and valuable breed is very evident. (5) JALALABAD CATTLE-BREEDING SCHEME. 34. In order to improve the cattle of this tract which resembles in type the Sahiwal breed, 9 bulls of the Mont- gomery breed were located in the year 1930-31. The working of these bulls has created a considerable interest in the zamindars' community of that ilaqa, which has been respon- sible for a further demand of bulls of this type. In the year under report, dependent upon the generosity of the proprietor of the Allahdad Cattle Farm in the Montgomery District, a further supply of 15 bulls was made to this area. Excluding two casualties, there are now 22 Montgomery bulls at work in this tract. Arrangements are also afoot to meet the demand for Montgomery heifers.
15 (6) KANGRA DISTRICT CATTLE-BREEDING SCHEME. 35. In Kangra District where the district authorities and the Public Health Department have repeatedly pressed for improvement of the milk supply of towns like Dharamsala, Sultanpur and Kangra, etc., Montgomery bulls of small stature were introduced in the year 1929-30 by the location of 40 bulls, free of cost, at suitable places from the Jahangira- abad Cattle Farm, in addition to 5 bulls already working in that district. These bulls have produced good progeny which are liked by the people. During the year 1930-31, two bulls, and, during the year under report, ten more bulls were sent from Jahangirabad Cattle Farm. Five casualties have so far been reported, thus leaving a balance of 52 at the close of the year. (7) IMPROVEMENT OF CATTLE-BREEDING IN LAHORE DISTRICT. 36. One hundred and twenty-eight District Board Hissar bulls were working at the close of the year in the selected area of Kahna Nau in Lahore District. This area is now well equipped with pedigree Hissar bulls, and there is a remarkable improvement in the local cattle. To supplement the services of the existing Hissar bulls in the tract 25 private- ly-owned bulls have been issued in the area. 4. GENERAL BREEDING WORK IN DISTRICTS. (a) Equines. Number of stallions16 (b) Bovines. Stud bulls -Table VII. 39. At the close of the year under report there were 3,857 district board stud bulls in the various districts of the Province in comparison with 3;520 last year. There were 721 additions and 384 castings during the year. 40. Indents for 376 Hissar bulls were sent to the Gov- ernment Cattle Farm, Hissar, all of which were supplied before the close of the year. The castings include bulls which died, or were cast on account of old age or unsuitability for further retention on the strength of approved bulls. Having carefully reviewed the position I consider that the maximum output of bulls from the Farm at its present stage of development, is definitely needed for absorption into the districts in order to conserve the work already initiated by the Department as represented by the 3,800 odd bulls now located in different villages of the Province. Under provincial control, these would require to be cast and replaced on a less haphazard system than has hitherto been possible under existing circumstances, thereby securing a greater degree of efficiency for the work. At the instance of the Department, all the District Boards in the Province have framed rules and bye-laws with a view to discouraging the practice of releasing scrub bulls. The necessity of exercising tact and gentle persuasion in this direction has been impressed upon the members of the staff. BUFFALO-BREEDING. 41. In order to meet the increased demand for milk and ghee, and to aid the commercial production and sale of milk by villagers, efforts are being made to improve buffalo- breeding in the villages. A fairly large number of buffalo bulls owned by zamindars has now been brought under the Department's supervision. A notable feature of the year under report is the philan- thropic offer of Guru Partap Singh of Bheni Sahib (District Ludhiana) to give annually, free of cost, all mature male stock bred at his farm, and declared fit for breeding purposes by the Department, to the District Board, Ludhiana, for the im- provement of buffaloes which is a very important industry in this district.
17 Some of the District Boards ear-marked suitable amounts for the organization of small buffalo shows in suitable areas, to stimulate the interest of buffalo breeders. The amounts were awarded in cash prizes at these shows held during the year under report. The statistical information in regard to the supply, etc., of buffalo bulls is given in table VII. (c) Others. CAMEL-BREEDING. 42. All the available evidence conclusively shows that interest in camel breeding is growing in the Fazilka and Muktsar tahsils of the Ferozepore District. The scheme is now in its fourtth year, but pancity of funds is a stumbling block to its progress. The District Board of Ferozepore subsi- dized 10 camels (the same number as last year). Three hundred and forty-seven coverings have been registered against 404 in the previous year. The decrease in the number of coverings during the year was due to the death of one stallion during the covering season. SHEEP AND GOAT-BREEDING. 43. The Department's scheme for the supply of three- quarters merino sheep to Kangra District at a concession rate has been in force since 1928-29. During the year under report, 87 more rams and 42 additional ewes were introduced from the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, into the local flocks (from which the local rams were entirely excluded), compared with 120 rams and 20 ewes supplied last year. 44. In the Malwa tract (comprising Ludhiana and Ferozepore Districts) and the Majha tract (comprising Lahore and Amritsar Districts) short ear type of sheep of the Bikaner ancestry owned mostly by the "Od" tribe and Majha sheep with black and red faces, and bodies resembling Bikaner sheep, are met with. The Department's touring staff is keeping in close touch with the owners of local flocks. Fazilka, where these people assemble for sheep shearing, is one of the most important wool markets in the Punjab. The Department in this area carried out a large number of castrations amongst the local flocks, by the Italian method, which is becoming increasingly popular among the breeders. C
18 5. CATTLE AND HORSE FAIRS AND SHOWS. Fairs and shows19 making a total of 288. These provide a network in the different revenue divisions as noted below:20 Rs. 11,402 and Rs. 7,771, respectively, during the previous year. This represents a decrease of Rs. 170 in income and an increase of Rs. 72 in expenditure. The reduction in shoeing charges by 20 per cent. sanctioned during the year under report was the cause of decrease in income, otherwise the hospital receipts are in excess of those of last year by a sum of Rs. 227. The surplus income amounting to Rs. 3,389, was credited into the Government treasury by the Simla Municipality. Treatment of diseases in villages21 or by the district staff in the course of their tours. A scheme was worked out for the control of glanders in the affected areas. It has been decided that visits to all private premises, including those of owners of tonga ponies, shall be made twice a year, in winter and in summer. The De- partment is carrying on negotiations with the Municipalities concerned on the subject. Surra. 55. The undernoted Surra centres were at work during the last Surra season :22 microscopical blood examination was 195 as compared with 97 during the previous year. (b) Bovines. Rinderpest. 56. Rinderpest appeared in all the districts of the province except Mianwali. It was particularly severe in the Lahore, Guj- ranwala and Sheikhupura districts. With the increased net-work of hospitals the Department is establishing closer contact with the actual disease incidence of the Province. Foot and Mouth Disease. 57. The disease appeared in 24 districts of the Province. It was severe in Kangra, Ludhiana and Karnal districts. The use of taramira oil as a dressing for mouth lesions and tar oil for foot cases are gaining in popularity. Both remedies are cheap and easily obtainable in the bazars. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia. 58. This disease appeared in all the districts of the Province, except Simla. It was res- ponsible for considerable mortality in Lyallpur, Amritsar and Shahpur districts. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia is a disease associated with water-logged low-lying, and riverain areas, where also para- sitic diseases of stock are rife. The mortality would have been very severe during the year under report, had it not been for the intervention of sera and vaccines in the well-known Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia areas. Black Quarter. 59. This disease was reported from 19 districts of the Province. The heaviest mortality took place in the Rawalpindi and Jhelum districts. The regional distribution of this disease is of considerable interest. Anthrax. 60. There were 27 cases of anthrax during the year under report, all being reported from the Jhelum District. Other contagious diseases. 61. During the year under report other diseases of a contagious nature occurred in 15 dis- tricts of the Province. (c) Other animals. 62. The following diseases occurred among other animals :28 3.CHAPTER III.-Veterinary Education. 1.25 Hospital. 72. The attendance in the various wards of the hospital was :26 Training in Surra treat- ment. 77. As a measure of economy, no member of the sub- ordinate veterinary staff nor any student of the final class of the Punjab Veteri- nary College was sent to Sheikhupura (Surra Training Centre) for training at Government expense. Dressers' Class. 78. Ten candidates attended the Dressers' Class and passed successfully during the year. Farriers' Class. 79. Twenty-seven candidates joined the Farriers' Class during the year. Twenty candidates passed the examination. 3.27 As recommended in some countries the Mercuric Chloride test for the diagnosis of Surra in camels was carried out. The results have not been found entirely reliable. Anatomy Section. 83. Forty museum specimens and 30 dissected speci- mens were prepared in this section during the year. A skeleton of a horse for the students was scientifically articulated and a skeleton of a camel is similarly under pre- paration. The work of the measurement of bones of Indian bred ponies and bullocks has also been taken in hand, and up to the present about two dozen skeletons of these animals have been measured, and the average length, width and weight of bones has been arrived at. No definite conclusions can yet be drawn until a considerably larger number of skeletons have been measured and weighed. Examination of Pathologi- cal specimens at Superinten- dents' headquarters. 84. Three hundred and one specimens received from the subordinate veterinary staff were examined in the laboratories at the headquarters of Circle Superinten- dents at Ferozepore, Rawalpindi and Ambala. Medicine Section. 85. In addition to teaching the subject of medicine the following work has been under- taken :28 Veterinary Staff at all the important horse and cattle fairs in the Province and were very much appreciated by the public. Hand-bills and leaflets, in the simplest possible vernacular language, dealing with various contagious diseases of animals were also distributed. Demonstrations by means of magic lantern slides, dia- grams, charts, and pathological specimens, as well as exhibits of live stock were made, as usual, at all the important horse and cattle fairs in the Province. These are proving very valuable for the zamindars, who are now realising the ad- vantages of keeping good live stock and the economic losses resulting from the maintenance of inferior stock. Literary work done by the staff of the Department. 88. (a) Mr. Aggarwala of the Punjab Veterinary College brought out his book on "Feeding and Milking of Cows." (b) He wrote the following articles :29 (viii) Kutton ki khúrák (feeding of dogs). Out of the above only five articles were published in different papers of the Province. (d) He has been able to obtain an old Sanskrit manuscript of a veterinary book entitled "Ashrchikitsa" which he is translating into English. In addition to the above, several articles containing useful information on cattle diseases were contributed to the Punjab Veterinary Journal by different members of the Department, as a result of closer co-operation with the tutorial staff of the Punjab Veterinary College. The Veterinary Journal, as a. professional reference for the benefit of the staff, shows a marked improvement.
CHAPTER IV31 B.CHAPTER V.CHAPTER VI. 1.34 Special effort is being made to foster the dual purpose type of cattle by supplying as large a number as possible of pedigree bulls, from the Government breeding farms, to various districts in the Province, also by the castration of unsuitable bulls on a large scale in the villages. Special live stock schemes subsidised by Government are in operation in certain areas, most suited to cattle breed- ing, including the Hariana and Dhanni Cattle tracts. 3.35 funds permit. A closer net-work of veterinary hospitals is gradually being secured which is increasing the efficiency of the Department for dealing with live stock work and veterinary aid. 2.36 responsible for further increase in the clerical work of the headquarters' office at Lahore. It is gratifying to note that the members of the office establishment have responded satisfactorily to the call of duty under the able supervision of the Office Superintendent, Lala Ram Rattan, whose name is specially brought to the notice of Government for good work. The present clerical staff of the Department as a whole is very small as compared with other departments of the Government. Proposals in this connection would have been laid before Government, but, in view of the acute financial difficulties, their submission has been purposely deferred for the present. The want of increase in the clerical staff is keenly felt in order to enable the officers of the Department to de- vote more time to their touring duty and professional study. (viii) The Director wishes to record here his appreciation of the assistance received from all officers and staff of the Department who have served well during the year. The names of the following District Deputy Superintendents deserve special mention of their good work :[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Bull King-bird (Montgomery Dairy Farm, Montgomery.)
