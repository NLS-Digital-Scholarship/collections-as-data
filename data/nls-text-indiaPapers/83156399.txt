T Sickness and mortality : Statement No. I. being 202 and 21*76 against 149 and 14'27 respectively, than in the previous year. Most of the admissions to hospital were due to malarial fevers, dysentery, tubercle of the lungs and intestines, diarrhoea, abscesses, ulcers, boils and anajmia. The number of deaths was also greater, being 47 against 23 in 1911. The percentage of deaths to daily average strength was 20'23 against 9*78 in the previous year. The chief causes of death in tho Asylum during the year under report were tubercle of the lungs and intestines (23), anaemia (10), dysentery (4), epilepsy (3), pneumonia (2), and old age and general debility (2). The heavy death-rate was due mainly to the increased mortality from tubercle of the lungs and intestines which caused nearly half the number of deaths and also to the fact that, of the 27 patients remaining in hospital from the previous year some of whom were admitted as long ago as 1910, 19 died during the year under report. Heaths from tubercle of the lungs and intestines in 1911 and 1910 were 10 and 12, respectively. This is as remarked in last year's report, undoubtedly the result of overcrowding and abi-eace of any means of segregation for infectious cases. In connection with the heavy mortality from tubercular diseases the Superintendent of the Asylum Major E. C. MacLeod, i.m.s., remarks, &quot; The spread of tuberculosis, is a cause of considerable anxiety and I trust that with the provision of ample air space and segregation sheds the mortality from this cause will rapidly decrease &quot;. In September 1912 a thatched building to accommodate 17 tubercular patients was erected outside the asylum and 13 such patients are now occupying this buildnig. As ordered by the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner at his inspection in the same month two more temporary tubercle wards to provide accommodation for 10 males and 8 females have been constructed and are occupied. These with the four temporary barracks which are being constructed in view of the anticipated increase in the population will relieve overcrowding. Of the four temporary wards two, one for males and one for females, will be ready for occupation in a few days and tho remaining two by the 1st June next. The ratios of deaths percent, of average strength amongst the inmates of the lunatic asylums in the different provinces of India in 1912 were as follows the Assar Inspector held by t The 1. Bengal 2.

FINANCE. 5. Excluding recoipts from paying patients which are credited to Government, Expenditure and cost per inmate Statements Noi. VIII, IX and X. the total expenditure for the up-keep of the asylum during the year under report was Rs. 21,369-15-5 op an average of Rs. 10-1-14-10 per head of inmates, against Rs. 23,100-2-9 or Rs. 98-4-11, respectively, in the previous year. The increase was due to higher coat under diet, establishment, clothing and bedding and contingencies. Excluding the charges on account of &quot; repairs and maintenance, ' &quot; rates and taxes' and profits on manufactures the average cost per inmate works out to Rs. 77-7-10 against Rs. 76-2-6 in 1911. The increase in expenditure under establishment proper was due to the personal allowance of Rs. 25 per month granted to the Deputy Superintendent of the Asylum and that under diet to high price of food stuffs and liberal use of sick diet. MISCELLANEOUS. 6. Including hospital, solitary cells and wards there was accommodation in the , . asylum for 157 males and 33 females during the year Accommodation. &#9632;, L m, . . n --&quot; , under report. The maximum number confined at any one night was 197 males and 42 females and the daily average of inmates under confinement was 191*23 males and 4102 females. As already stated, four temporary barracks are under construction and will be ready for occupation shortly. There is at present hospital accommodation for only 15 males and 3 females. Temporary arrangements can however be made as soon as the new barracks and tubercle sheds are ready. 7. The asylum was visited during the year by His Honour the Lieutenant- Governor of Eastern Bengal and Assam, by the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner of Assam, the Commissioner of the Assam ValleyiDistricts, the Sessions Judge of the Assam Valley Districts and the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Assam, once each.

Of the 23 deaths, 14 were tubercular in their origin against 23 in the previous year ; the rest were due to pneumonia, acute nephritis, epilepsy and other diseases. The provision of ample air space and the building of three temporary segregation sheds have helped to olieck the mortality from diseases due to tubercle.

TRIENNIAL REPORT ON THE PROVINCIAL LUNATIC ASYLUM IN ASSAM POB THE YEARS i9i2, i9i3 and i9i4- The following officers held charge of the Provincial Lunatic Asylum at Tezpur during the triennium under review : Introductory. Lieutenant-Colonel E. C. MacLeod, i.m.s., held charge of the Asylum from 21st December 1912 to the end of the triennium with the exception of the periods noted below : (1) Major A. Leventon, i.m.s., from 1st January to 5th June 1912. (2) Assistant Surgeon Jatindra Mohan Sikdar from 6th June to 3rd October 1912 and from 28th July 1913 to 11th August 1913. (3) Assistant Surgeon Shushil Chandra Bhattacharjee from 4th October to 20th December 1912. (4) Major W. D.

The increase has been steady and the number of admissions (95) in 1914 pas the largest during the triennium. As usual, the districts of Darrang, Lakhimpur hud Sibsagar furnished the largest numbers. The number of readmissions has increased from 11 to 16 during the triennium , . . under report. Of those 7 were criminal and 9 nou-crmv- nai. ihe criminal lunatics were re-admitted after trial pad the non-criminal at intervals of 6 months to 8 years. The number of discharges, excluding escapes, was 20 in 1912, 10 in 1913 and 45 &laquo;. . in 1914, or an average of 27, against 22*88 in the previous 6 trjennium. Recoveries numbered 16, 14 and 89 respect- PV(ay, averaging 23, against k0 in the preceding triennium. The number made over ro their friends and relatives as mentally improved was 3 in 1912, 2 in 1913 and 6 Pi 1914. One lunatic was made over to his relatives in 1912 on security, bis mental condition not having improved. The percentage of recoveries calculated on th&laquo;- daily verage strength was 0 89 in 1912, 570 in 1913 and 13*87 in 1914.

Of the 95 admissions and readmissions in 1914, the causes of insanity were known in 77 cases or 81 per cent., against 24 or 32*43 per cent, in 1913 and 21 or 31 82 per cent, in 1912. The principal predisposing and exciting causes of those admitted were : Predisposing. Exeiting.

The Superintendent reports but little, if any, improvement in the quality of the information supplied in the portion of the medical history sheets filled in by the Police and I am enquiring into the matter. Out of the 235 admissions and readmissions during the triennium the predisposing and exciting causes were known in 63 and 88 cases respectively. VITAL. The total number of admissions to hospital was 202 in 1912, 189 in 1913 and 122 Bxkness and mortai't in _ 914 with a daily average sick of 24*70, 39*00 and mor a 1 y. 51-50, respectively, against 132 admissions in 1909, 154 in 1910 and 149 in 1911, and a daily average sick of 11*03, 14*56 and 14*27, respectively.

The number of admissions to hospital fell from 202 and 189 in 1912 and 1913 to |l22 in 1914. The decrease was chiefly due to thero being onh '6 admissions for malaria and 19 for tuberculosis against an average of 53'5 and 30 for malaria and tuberculosis respectively in tho two previous years. As prophylaxis by quinine was carried out in each year on the same lines, the improvement in the malaria admission jrate must be put down to improvement in the drainage in and round the asylum. The gradual increase in the daily average of sick is due to tubercular cases when | once admitted to hospital remaining on the Register. There were 47 deaths in 1912, 23 in 1913 and 17 in 1914, the percentages of Ideaths to daily average strength being 20'2 5, 9'47 and G'05, respectively, against 18 or |s-l8 per cent., 20 or 8'2S per cent, and 23 or 9'78 per cent, in 1909, 1910 and 1911.

The increase in the expenditure in 1914 was due to a variety of causes, the prin-cipal being a Public Works Department charge of Rs. 37,030 for buildings, etc. Amongst other causes may be mentionedan increased rate of allowance to the Superintendent, an increase in the pay of the Deputy Superintendent, the appointment of a separate Sub-Assistant Surgeon for the hospital, the revision of pay as well as the strength of subordinate establishment and the increased expenditure under diet, clothing and bedding, contingencies proper, Europe and .Bazar Medicines, etc., owing to an increase in the number of inmates, as also to the increased cost of food supplies. The principal item of expenditure was the cost of diet which amounted to Rs. 12,077-8-9 in 3912, Rs. 13,541-3-0 in 1913 and Rs. 18,733-3-3 in 1914 against Rs. 12,861-7-0, Rs. 11,950-6-3 and Rs. 11,839-15-9 in 1909, 1910 and 19111 respectively.

Tlie inmates are mainly employed on cultivation of paddy, jute, sugarcane - . . ,. . and vegetables, construction and repair of buildings, Employment of mmates. &raquo; ? **_ . , , , . ,.x __.,., p ' manufacture of bricks and surki pounding. Healthy and well behaved lunatics were employed by the Municipality for road making. Females were generally employed in weaving cloth, steaming and husking paddy and surki pounding. During the triennium under report 2 temporary barracks each for 40 males Accommodation. and 50 females were built to relieve overcrowding, and four temporary wards for tubercular cases to accommodate 48 males and 8 females were also constructed. The present accommodation is for 245 males and 91 females. Tho maximum number of lunatics confined on any one night during the triennium was ?37 males and 56 females, i.e., a total of 293. Night-soil is trenched on a selected site on asylum land outside the stockade, but infectious stools are destroyed in an incinerator. The old ^Fanitary and Hospital arrange- maaonpy day-latrines have' been replaced by Donaldson's pattern latrines-12 for males and 4 for females. Kerosene oil is used for destroying mosquito larvie in possible breeding places. Two pucoa drains were constructed in 1914 at a cost of Rs. 1,700 one 213 feet long from the cookshed to the south-west hola and the other, the main drain, 532/-C&quot; in length from the w oil outside the asylum front entrance to the same hola. The water supply is good but not sufficient. This will be remedied with tho introduction of the municipal water-supply scheme. The food is g*&gt;d and Sufficient and there is an ample supply of vegetables grown in the Asylum. Great care is taken lie matter of personal cleanliness, the inmates bathe daily and their clothing i iled and washed weekly. The blankets and bedding are exposed to the sun and ted when necessary, and the supply ia adequate.
During the triennium the Asylum was visited once by His Honour the Lieutenant* Governor ot: Eastern Bengal ami Assam, once by the nspecions. Hon'blc the Chief Commissioner of Assam, three times leach by the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Assam, and the Commissioner of Assam Valley Districts and once by the Deputy Commissioner of Darrang. Thirty-Ifoiir meetings of the Committee of visitors were held during the triennium. The improvement in the health of inmates is mainly due to the careful segregation of tubercular cases in well-ventilated sheds which General remarks. ^ built {r 1913 The miCr0SC0pe Supplied in 1914 Ihas proved useful for diagnosis of cases. At my inspection in November 1911, I went carefully into the plans of the new buildings with the Superintendent and the Executive Engineer, and when these are constructed we sball have an asylum worthy of Ithe Province. The time of the Deputy Superintendent is at present wasted over keeping up a Lumber of registers and accounts and the receipt and issue of storeswork which should he done by a clerk and a store-keeper. On the female side the services of a matron are urgently required. I hope to submit proposals for this extra establishment I shortly to Government. Credit is due to Lieutenant-Colonel E. C. MacLeod for his careful management lof the institution in which he was ably supported by Rai Sahib Giiish Chandra Das, the Deputy Superintendent. Camp Kohima; The 15*A April 1915. H. E.

Resolution on the Report on the working of the Provincial Lunatic Asylum in Assam for the triennium 1912-1914. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the Municipal \Depart?nent, No. 2386^/., dated the ISth May 1915. Read The Triennial Report on the Provincial Lunatic Asylum in Assam for the years 191, 1913 and 1914. Kbad ALSO The Annual Returns oE the Asylum for the years 1912 and 1913. RESOLUTION. The number of lunatics in confinement at the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum during the three years dealt with in this Report was 298, 303 and 355, respectively. Admissions and re-admissions numbered 66 in 1912, 74 in 1913, and 95 in 1914. The increase in the two later years was mainly due to the fact that lunatics from Sylhet and Cachar, who had previously been admitted to the Dacca Asylum, were received at Tezpur from the later part of 1913. 2. At his visit to the Asylum in 1912 Sir Arohdale Earle found the accommodation entirely insufficient. There was serious overcrowding, and the health of the inmates suffered particularly from the inadequacy of the arrangements for segregating tuberculous cases. A project for re-constructing the building at a cost of over three and a half lakhs has been prepared and the work on it has commenced. Meanwhile adequate temporary accommodation has been provided, and it is satisfactory that the result has j&gt;roved so successful. In spite of the increase in the number of inmates, the number of deaths decreased from 47 in 1912 to 17 in 1914, fatal cases of tuberculosis falling from 23 to 7. In 1914, the rate of mortality amongst the inmates of the Asylum was lower than in any other province of India. The marked improvement effected in the health of the Asylum is most creditable to the Superintendent, Lieutenant-Colone] MacLeod, I. m. s., and the Deputy Superintendent, Rai Sahib Girish Chandra Das. 3. There were eight escapes from the Asylum during the triennium. The number is large, and a special report on the subject will be called for. 4. The Chief Commissioner regards it as most unsatisfactory that, in spite of repeated orders, the medical history sheets of lunatics have not been properly prepared by the responsible officers. A full report on this question will also be called for. 5. The Chief Commissioner is indebted to the Hon'ble Colonel Banatvala for a careful and interesting report. Order.Ordered that the Resolution and the Report be published in the Asiam Gazette. \ By order of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, A. W. BOTHAM, Second Secretary to the Q/iief Commimoner ofAswrn*

The Sickness and mortality. &quot; . , P , . * r. ..% ,t &raquo; &deg; i&raquo;i &raquo; n l special feature in connection with the health of the inmates is the steadily decreasing number of admissions and deaths from diseases due to tubercle, as will be seen from the table below : 1913. 1914. 1915. Number of admissions to hospital ... ... 86 19 10 Number of deaths ... ... 14 7 6 The increase in the daily average number of sick is due to the following reasons : (1) Tuberculosis45 cases remained over from 1914 against 37 remaining at the end of 1913. (2) Skin diseasesin 1915 these are shown as admissions, whereas in 19H cases of itch, ring-worm and other skin diseases were treated without being shown as admissions. (3) Increase in admissions from malaria. The bulk of the admissions to hospital were for malaria (11 against 3), tubercle of lung and other tubercular diseases (10 against 19), dysentery (39 against 37) &raquo;n(1 abscess, ulcer, boils, etc. (11 against 12). Of the 29 deaths, 6 were tubercular iD [their oiigin, against 7 and 14* in the years 1914 and 1913, respectively ; the rest were klue to pneumonia, Bright's disease, dysentery, exhaustion after mania and other diseases. There were several accidents, self-inflicted wounds and assaults, but none of these were of a serious nature except the following 3 cases :&#9632; Injuries and accidents. x &quot; 1. A criminal lunatic suddenly became violent and killed another lunatic \ throwing a stone at his head causing fiacture of the sk'.ill. The injured man dltl in l\ hours.
2 & 3. Two lunatics committed suicide by hanging. The ratios of deaths per cent, of average strength amongst the inmates of the lunatic asylums in the different provinces in India in 1915 were as follows : 1. Bombay 2. Bengal 3. Burma 4. Assam 71 781 8-5 8-92 9-56 10-22 10*38 1 -3) 18-00 5. Punjab 6. United Provinces 7. Madras 8. Central Provin-es 9. Bihar and Oris.a FINANCE. Excluding receipts for paying patients which are credited to Government, the _.TTT T_ v total expenditure for the up-keep of the Asylum Statements VIII,IX and X. duringthe year amounted to Rs. 50,802-13-2 against fts. 76,119-6-8, with an average cost per head of Rs. 174-13-0 against Ks. 270-11-11 in 1914. The decrease was due to the charges on account of work done by the Puhlic Works Department being less (Rs 15,567-13-7 against Rs. 37,030-0-0). Excluding the Puhlic Works Department charges, repairs and maintenance, rates and taxes, receipt from paying patients and profits on manufactures, the average cost per inmate works out to Us. 101-5-11 against Rs. 111-2-4 in the previous year. The profits in the manufactory department were Rs. 7,240-9-9 or an average of Rs. 49-7-9 per head of inmates employed on manufactures. The cost of diet amounted to Rs. 21,507-5-9 against Rs. 18,733-3-3 in 1914 or an average cost of Rs. 66-3-1 against Rs. 66-10-1 per head of inmates. The clerical work in a large asylum is always large, and so far it has been cheerfully performed by the Deputy Superintendent and the compounder, but with a steadily increasing population it has been found necessary to apply for sanction for a combined clerk and store-keeper and one will be entertained during 1916. A matron has also been sanctioned by Government but on account of the financial stringency no provision has been made for her entertainment yet. MISCELLANEOUS. The accommodation has been increased from 215 for males and 91 for females to 263 and 97 respectively by the addition of two teuioo-rary wards. The existing number or cells (8 in number) is not sufficient and accommodation under this head will have to be increased as soon a9 funds permit. The construction of permanent quarters for the staff was taken in hand and quarters for the Sub-Assistant Surgeon, compounder and jamadar were completed during the year. The remaining staff quarters, award of 23 male patients, a rat-proof cloth godown and an addition to the cook loom annexe are expected to be completed during 1916. The maximum number of lunatics confined on any one night was 290 males and 70 females, i.e , a total of 360. The asylum was visited during the year once by the Hon'ble the Chief Com-j .. missioner of Assam and once by the Inspector General of p ' Civil Hospitals, Assam. Ten meetings were held by the visitors of the asylum during the year. H. E. BANATVALA, Colonel, I.M.S., Inspector General of Civil Hospitals, Assam.

REPORT ON THE STATISTICAL RETURNS OF THE PROVINCIAL LUi\ATlC ASYLUM IN ASSAM FOR THE Year 1916 with brief explanatory notes. 1. Major J. W. McCoy, I.M.S., held charge of the Provincial Lunatic Asylum _ . , at Tezpur during the year 1916. Introductory. * &deg; * Senior grade, Class I, Sub-Assistant Surgeon Eai Sahib Girish Chandra Das, was the Deputy Superintendent from the 1st January to the 11th July and 3rd-grade Sub-Assistant Surgeon Mukhtar Hussain fcr the rest of the year. General. 2. The total number of lunatics confined in the Asylum at the end of 1915, was ._ ., . . 352, viz.. 283 males and 69 females. During the vear statement I.Admissions. i . -, rtM ,. i %&gt; -,, , . . &gt;. ,*&#9632; ., under review 12o (including 11 re-admissions) were admitted, of whom 109 were males and 16 females, the corresponding admission figure for 1915 being 129. 3. There were 11 re-admissions, of whom 8 were males and 3 females, against 5 l\o-admissions. and 1, respectively, in the previous year. Of these, 1 male was a criminal who escaped on the 5th December 1915, and was recaptured and re-admitted on the 23rd July 1916, 1- were transferred from the criminal list and the rest were non-criminals. These non-criminal lunatics were re-admitted after an interval of 3 months and a half to six years and 2 months. 4). The number of discharges, excluding 2 escapes and 3 observation cases found _. , sane, was 77 against 3:3 in the previous year. Of these, 58 were discharged cured, 14 were made over to their friends as &quot; mentally improved &quot;, d&lt; were transferred, to tho non-oriminal list and 1 escaped and was discharged after recapture at Sylhet by the orders of the Magistrate. 5. There were 20 escapes during the yearthe same number as in tho previous yearof whom 2 remained uncaptured at the end of the year. Most of the barracks are kutoha, the enclosure wall is a bamboo palisade, and there is no watch and ward over the patients at night as in a jail, so that we must expect escapes until the new building project is completed. All oases of escapes wero duly reported to the Magistrate and the Police. Tho responsible keepers were adequately punished. m. . .. ., 0. Tho daily avcracre strength roso from 32-1'94 to llio daily average strength. Qpn-ll 7. The year opened with 115 criminal lunatics and 21* (including one re-admission) were admitted, bringing the total number to 139. Of these, 10 were discharged and 19 died leaving 110 in tho Asylum on the 31st December 1910. The 10 discharges consisted of 4 cures, 4 transfers to the non-criminal list and 2 escapes. The daily average strength was 114&quot;G3 against 98*93 in 1915.
8. Classified by religion, 89 were Hindus, 22 Muhamrnadans and 10 other castes Stat ntiil a total of 121. These figures exclude 3 observation cases discharged as sane and 1 who committed suicide. Of these 63 were natives of the province, 37 came from other provinces, while the residences of the remaining 21 were not known. In the Province itself the Sylhet, Lakhimpur and Darrang districts were responsible for the largest number of patients, viz*, 21, 8 and 8, respectively. The admissions comprised 105 males and 16 females. 9. Cultivators and tea-garden coolies furnished the largest number of admissions. As in previous years, the admissions were mostly during Statements IV and V. ^e age period 20 to 40 years. 10. There is nothing special to note about the types of insanity. Predisposing causes Statements VI and VIT. were known in 38 cases and exciting causes in 47. In 10. cases both the predisposing and exciting causes were known. No cause was assignable in 35 cases. Vital. 11. The total number of admissions to hospital rose from 123 to 222 and the death-rate per cent, on the daily average population from 892 Sicknessand mortallfcy- to U'te. As many as 80 of the admissions were for dysen- tery (58) and tuberculosis (22)diseases favoured by overcrowding. It is the male portion of the Asylum that has been overcrowded and has suffered most and the table below illustrates how the death-rate has increased with the rise in the population and has declined when the accommodation has been extended. 1912. 1918. 1914. 1915. 1916. f Male Total accommodation &#9632;{ (.

Immediate measures were taken to relieve the overcrowding and the accommodation was increased in 1913 to 2-i-6&raquo; with the result tnat the deaths fell to 23 in 1913 and 17 in 1911. &quot; In 1915 the accommodation was again increased, the daily average population being 261*4.4. &quot; During the year under report the population made another jump, by an increase of 30 in the daily average number, exceeding the accommodation by 28. &quot; There can bo no question that the increase in mortality is due to anything els&deg; but the overcrowding.
castes n cases &raquo;f these idences liimpur 21, 8 issions. during causes In 10. known. &quot; It is unfortunate that the project for rebuilding the Asylum has been delayed on account of iinancial stringency, but the building of a pucca barrack, which will bo handed over before the close of the financial year and the scheme of temporary measures drawn up by the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Assam, will relieve the overcrowding and improve matters generally.&quot; A new pucca barrack for 26 inmates is nearing completion and will be ready for occupation by the 1st April. In the scheme of improvements estimated to cost Ks. 22,000 sanctioned by Government after my inspection of the Asylum in November last provision has been made for the construe tionol&quot; another barrack to accommodate 26, increasing the Asylucn enclosure area and the day-latrine accommodation and providing pucca floors for barracks, and cage pattern iron night-latrines. The Superintendent has introduced the system of taking out daily as mauy of the inmates as he can to the neighbouring maid .n within Asylum grounds keeping them occupied the whole day and bringing them in lor meals. This relieves to a larger extent the pressure on the enclosure accommodation. The Superintendent remarks that the percentage of admissions in good health was very small during the year, as many as 66 per cent, being in indifferent health. Of the 52 deaths, one was clue to a non-criminal lunatic being suddenly kicked on the head by another, death occuring within 10 minutes of haemorrhage and another to suicide by hanging. Of the remaining 50, 14 died of dysentery against 4 in 1915. The rest were due to exhaustion after mania, or epileptic coma, diseases of the liver, heart or lungs and other diseases. The ratios of deaths per cent, of average strength amongst the inmates of the Lunatic Asylums in the different provinces in India in 1915 and in 1916 were as follows : 1915. 1916. ) death-&gt;m 8-92 &#9632; dysen-e male 3 table 3n and 1916. 259 97 291-58 6856 306 69 222 72-46 13-07 46 6 15-77 8-75 1444 s : diseases i 291 in high as 3 taken to 215. mlation increase ng elsc Burma United Provinces ...

Excluding receipts for paying patients and miscellaneous receipts which are c, _TTT T , credited to Government the tolal expenditure for the up-StatementsViH.lXandX. keep of the Asylum amountod to Its. 71,028-0-3 against Ks. 56,802-13-2 with an average cost per head of Rs 197-3-9 against Rs. 174-13-0 in 1915. The increase was due to a large increase in the number of inmates as also to an increase in the price of dietary articles. It was also found necessary to issue extras to a larger number of patients than in the previous year. Excluding the Public Works Department charges, repairs and maintenance, rates and taxes, receipts from paying patients, miscellaneous receipts and profits on manufactures, the average cost per inmate works out to Us. 115-0-2 against Us. 104-5-11 in the previous year. The profits in the manufactory department were Its. 8,403-2-4 against Rs. 7,240-9-9 or an average of Its. 61-15-0 per head of inmates employed on manufactures. The cost of diet amounted to Rs. 26,551-7-11 against Its. 21,507-5-9 in 1915 or an average cost of Rs. 79-4-6 against Rs, 66-3-1 per head of inmates. Owing to the financial stringency the matron mentioned in the last report has Hot yet been entertained. Miscellaneous. 13. The male inmates are mainly employed on cultivation of vegetables, sugar-&laquo; ,.. cane and paddy, repairs of buildings and palisading, Employment of inmates. , ., i i- A c i / \ m7i a i tailoring and manuiacture of molasses (gur). The females are employed on paddy-husking, weaving and s/^i-pounding. No lunatics were employed extrarnuraily.
14. It -will be seen that the present male accommodation is less by 4&lt; than dnvjjjJ the previous year. This is due to a portion ofcnejofthe temporary barracks being dismantled to enable the Public Works Department to construct the new pucca barrack referred to above. Since my inspection the Superintendent has emptied a godown and is using it to lock up 9 of the inmates in good mental condition. The cell accommodation will have to be increased as soon as funds are avail-able. A rat-proof cloth godown and married and unmarried keepers' quarters were com-pleted during the year. The maximum number of lunatics confined on any one night was 306 males and 69 females, i.e., a total of 375, the accommodation being for 259 males and 97 females. 15. Night soil is trenched on a selected site in the Asylum ground outside the stockade, but infectious stools are destroyed in an incine. &quot;mcnls. an &deg;P1 a airange&quot; rator. Hycol and hyphenoid are freely used for disinfect- ing the latrines, drains and hospital. Drinking water is good and is boiled before use. 16. The Asylum was visited twice by the Inspector General of Civil Hospitals, Assam, during the year. Thirteen meetings were held by nspec 10n' the visitors against 10 held in 1915.

TRIENNIAL REPORT ON THE PROVINCIAL LUNATIC ASYLUM IN ASSAM FOR THE Years 1915, 1916 and 1917. Lieutenant-Colonel E. C. MacLeod, i.m.s., held charge of the Provincial Lunatic introductory Asylum at Tezpur, from the 1st January to the 15th March 1915 and Major J. &quot;W. McCoy, i.m.s., from the 16th March 1915 to the end of the triennium. Senior-grade, Class I, Sub-Assistant Surgeon Rai Sahib Girish Chandra Das was Deputy Superintendent from the 1st January 1915 to the 11th J uly 1916 and 3rd-grade Sub-Assistant Surgeon Mukhtar Hussain from the 12th July 1916 to the end of the triennium. General. The total number of lunatics under confinement was 420 in 1915, 477 in 1916 Statement No. I. and 459 in 1917, against 298 in 1912, 303 in 1918 and 355 in 1914, a large increase during the triennium under review. The main features regarding admissions during the two triennia were that the daily average strength increased from 281*15 in 1914 to 341*44 in 1917, the number of admissions and re-admissions rose from 235 to 370 and that 1915 gave the largest number of admissions, viz., 323. The districts of Sylhet, Lakhimpur and Kamrup furnished the largest numbers. The number of re-admissions has increased from 16 in the previous triennium to . 32 in the present. Of these, 7 were criminal and the rest non-criminal. The criminal lunatics were re-admitted after trial and the non-criminals at intervals of 7 months to 13 years. The number of discharges, excluding observation cases and escapes, was 70 in 1917 or an average of 59*33, against 27 in the previous trien-lsc arges. nium. There were 64 recoveries in 1917, and an aver- age of 51*33 for the triennium against an average of 23 during the previous 3 years. The number made over to their friends and relatives as mentally improved was 6 in 1917, and an average of 8'00 against 3*6 in the triennium preceding. The percentage of recoveries on the daily average strength was 9*85 in 1915,16*1 in 1916 and 18*74 in Ml. Escapes numbered 63 against 8 in the previous triennium. Of these, 57 were recaptured and 6 are still at large. As many as 47 occur-scape3* red from inside the palisading. It appears that in the previous triennium only those escapes which remained uncaptured at the end of each year were shown as having escaped. The present figures are an accurate record of existing conditions and for obvious reasons cannot be compared with the figures of the previous triennium. The large number of escapes is probably due to an inferior peeper establishment, good up-country men not being available for service, and to the *&ot that a certain amount of latitude must be given to the inmates inside the enclosure. The total number of criminal lunatics admitted were 35 in 1917, and an average 8tah&raquo;m..&raquo; tt n n * of 31*66 against 19'7 in the triennium ending 1914. Of &#9632;statement II.

Of the 356 admissions and re-admissions, 218 or 60'G7 per cent, were natives of the province and 89 or 25 per cent, were natives of other ,. ?1*tom&reg;nt ni.-, Nationallty' provinces including tea-garden coolies.

The percentage figures for the previous triennium were 82*55, 11*91, 1*28 and 4*26, respectively. The proportion of males to females was 5 to 1, against 4 to 1 in the previous triennium. tv d v ^e lar8es* ^umner &deg;f insanes were among cultivators occupstiSTand age? revi0us an(i tea-garden coolies and between 20 and 40 years of age.

Tne admissions for Melan-Types and alleged causes of in- cholia were 26 in 1915, 44 in 1916 and 47 in 1917. The samty&quot; number of recoveries from Mania were 17 in 1915, 36 in 1916 and 30 in 1917, and from Melancholia 6, 12 and 20, respectively. Of the 93 new admissions in 1917 the causes of insanitv were known in 65 cases, or 69*09 per cent., against 68*18 per cent, in 1916 and 72*73 per cent, in 1915.

3 The decrease in malaria admissions is satisfactory and is probably due to a daily issue of 6 grains of quinine from April to October in place of 15 grains twice a week on two days running, and also to increased attention being paid to drainage in and around the Asylum. The decrease in the admissions for tuberculosis in 1917 shows the extent to which overcrowding is responsible for the prevalence of this disease, as the construction of a new barrack and increasing the ventilation of existing ones have reduced the number 0f admissions from 22 in 1916 to 8 in 1917. The gradual increase in the daily average number of sick is due to tubercular cases, when once admitted to hospital, remaining on the register, and to skin diseases and epileptic cases being shown as admissions to hospital and not as out-door cases. There were 29 deaths in 1915, 52 in 1916 and 19 in 1917, the percentage of deaths to daily average strength being 8'92, 14f41 and 5*56, respectively, against 20'23 per cent, in 1912, 9'47 per cent, in 1913 and 6'05 per cent, in 1914.

Whenever this was strained the number of deaths in general and from tubercle in particular have always gone up. This is illustrated in the table below:- --------- 1912. 1913. 1914. 1915. 1916. 1917.

4 Mnance. Excluding receipts from paying patients and miscellaneous receipts which were c* * 4 itttt txt iv credited to Government, the total expenditure amounted statements vin, ix and X. to Ks. 56,802-13-2 in 1915, Bs. 71,028-0-3 in 1916 and Rs. 73,121-4-6 in 1917, i.e., an average of Rs. 66,984-0-8 against Rs. 46,017-7-0 in the previous triennium. The cose per head was Rs. 174-13-0 in 1915, Rs. 197-3-9 in 1916 and Rs. 214-2-6 in 1917 against Rs. 104-14-10, Rs. 154-11 9 and Rs. 270-11-U in 1912,1913 and 1914, respectively. Excluding the Public Works Department charges, repairs and maintenance, rates and taxes, receipts from paying patients and profits on manufactures, the average cost per inmate works out to Rs. 104-5-11 in 1915, Rs. 115-0-2 in 1916 and Rs. 141-6-10 in 1917 against Rs. 77-7-10, Rs. 94-9-2 and Rs. 111-2-4 in 1912, 1913 and 1914, respectively. The principal causes of increase in expenditure were : (1) increase in the number of inmates and consequent increase in the dietary charges, contingencies and charges for clothing and bedding, (2) increase in the price of food grains, (3) increased cost of bazar medicines, (4) replacement of enamelled iron plates by aluminium ones and (5) increase in the price of clothing. The principal item of expenditure was the cost of diet which amounted to Rs. 21,507-5-9 in 1915, Rs. 28,551-7-11 in 1916 and Rs. 30,014-6-7 in 1917, against Rs. 12,077-8-9 in 1912, Rs. 13,541-3-0 in 1913 and Rs. 18,733-3-3 in 1914. The average cost of diet per lunatic was Rs. 66-3-1, Rs. 79-4-6 and Rs. 87-14-6 in 1915, 1916 and 1917, respectively, against Rs. 52-0-0, Rs. 55-12-6 and Rs. 66-10-1, respectively, in 1912,1913 and 1914. The receipts from paying patients were Rs. 472-13-11 in 1915, Rs. 130-8-3 in 1916 and Rs. 495-12-4 in 1917&quot;, against Rs. 281-4-9, Rs. 586-6-2 and Rs. 313-12-6 in 1912, 1913 and 1914, respectively. The profits on manufacture in 1915 were Rs. 7,210-9-9, in 1916 Rs. 8,403-2-4 and in 1917 Rs. 5,189-5-8 against Rs. 5,746-13-0 in 1912, Rs. 6,269-1-9 in 1913 and Rs. 7,411-14-11 in 1914. The decrease is due to the stoppage of extra-mural work. Miscellaneous. The male inmates are mainly employed on cultivation of paddy, vegetables, _ . sugarcane, repair of buildings and palisading, tailoring mpoymen o mma es. and manufacture of molasses (gur). Females are gene- rally employed in paddy-husking, surki-pounding and weaving. Weaving has, however, been discontinued from the latter part of 1917 as it was unsatisfactory and led to loss to Government. During the triennium under report a temporary ward for males, another for 6 female tubercle cases, a pucca barrack for 26 male inmates and a block of 4 cells have been constructed increasing the accommodation from 245 for males and PI for females to 289 and 97, respectively. The maximum number of lunatics confined on any one night during the triennium was 306 males and 69 females, i.e., a total of 375. With the construction of a kutoha barrack to accommodate 26 inmates which is under construction and funds for which were allotted during 1917-18 it is hoped there will be no overcrowding in the male portion of the Asylum for some time to come. Night soil is trenched on a selected site on Asvlum land outside the stockade, Sanitary and Hospital arrange- but infectious stools are destroyed in an incinerator. ments. The water-supply is good and sufficient and since the latter part of 1917 has been drawn from the Municipal main. The food is good and sufficient and there is an ample supply of vegetables grown in the Asylum. Great care is taken in the matter of personal cleanliness, and that of clothing and bedding which is regularly boiled and washed. A scale of clothing and bedding has been recently prescribed. During the triennium under report the Asylum was visited twice by the Hon'hle . u the Chief Commissioner of Assam, five times by tbti nspecionn. Inspector General of Civil Hospitals, Assam, and once by the Commissioner of the Assam Valley Districts. There were 35 meetings of the Committee of Visitors against 34 in the previous triennium. The strength of tli&deg; Asylum Committee of visitors was increased in 1917 from 11 to 13.
Rules were framed during 1917 under Section 91(1) of the Indian Lunacy Act, 1912 (IV of 1912). The improved health of inmates during 1917 was mainly due to the provision of increased accommodation, the improvement of ventilation in existing barracks, and the attention to every detail connected with the health of inmates given by the Superintendent. Other Asylum buildings constructed during the triennium were: 1. Sub-Assistant Surgeon's quarters. 2. Two compounders' quarters. 3. Jamadar's quarters. 4i. Married keepers' quarters. 5. Un-married keepers' quarters. 6. Rat-proof cloth godown. 7. Sweepers' quarters. 8. An annexe to the cookshed. Two additional bathing troughs and platforms were built and the palisading was extended, increasing the area of the enclosure by 1,110 square yards. Discipline has improved, but a good deal more remains to be effected. Credit is due to Major J. W. McCoy, i.m.s., for his careful management of the Asylum. H. E.

Resolution on the Heport on the Working of the Provincial Lunatic Asylum in Ass^m for the triennium 1915-17. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner oj Assam in the Municipal Department, No. 3299Jf., dated the 10th May 1918. Rbad- The Triennial Beport on the Provincial Lunatic Asylum in Aspam for the years 1915, 1916 and 1917. Rbad also The Annual Returns of the Asylum for the years 1915 and 1916. RESOLUTION. The number of lunatics confined in the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum rose from 956 in the previous triennium to 1.366 in the triennium under report. The daily average strength increased from 28115 in 1914 to 34l'44 in 1917, and the number of admissions and re-admissions from 235 to 370. Admissions from tbe districts of Sylhet, Lakhimpur and Kamrup were more numerous than from any others. The Chief Commissioner notes with satisfaction that there ^as a decrease in the number of malaria admissions to hospital, and that deaths from tubercle represented only 25 per cent, of the total deaths during the period under report against 50 per cent, in the previous triennium. In 1917, the rate of mortality among the inmates of the asylum, viz., 5*56 per cent., was lcwer than in any other province in India. Ihe improved health of the inmates is mainly attributable to the provision of more accommodation, and to the improvement of the ventilation of the existing barracks. It is clear, however, from the report that, at times, still more accommodation is needed. The matter is one which has not escaped the attention of the Local Administration ; full provision will be made, as circumstances and funds permit. The Chief Commissioner's thanks are due to Major J. W. McCoy, i.m.s., for his careful management of the asylum, and to the Hon'ble Colonel Banatvala for an interesting report. Order.Ordered that the Resolution and the Report be published in the Assam Gazette. By order of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, A. R. EDWARD8, Offff.

REPORT ON THE STATISTICAL RETURNS OF THE PROVINCIAL LUNATIC ASYLUM IN ASSAM FOR THE year i9i9 with brief explanatory notes. 1. Major J. W. McCoy, i.m.s., held charge of the Provincial Lunatic Asylum at introductory. TezPur throughout the year 1919. Third-grade Sub-Assistant Surgeon Muktar Hussain was the Deputy Superintendent throughout the year. General. 2. The total number of lunatics confined in the Asylum at the close of the year 0, . . T ., . . 1918 was 391, including 4 observation cases, of whom 312 Statement IAdmissions. _ &#9632;, , .&raquo; &deg;, ,. . ,, , , were males and 79 females. During the year under report 101 (86 males and 15 females) were admitted into the Asylum including 6 re-admissions, the corresponding admission figure for 1918 being ilO. 3. There were 6 re-admissions, of whom 5 were males and 1 female, against 4 , . . and 1, respectively, in the previous year. The intervals Ke admissions. v i &laquo; ri 1- 11 *.i i. m since discharge were in 5 lunatics 11 months to 5-| years and in 1, 3 months. 4. The number of discharges, excluding 2 escapes and 9 observation cases found _. . sane, was 64, against 46 in the previous year. Of these, 60 were discharged cured and 4 were made over to their friends as &quot; mentally improved &quot;. 5. There were 26 escapes during the year under review, against the same number in 1918, of whom 2 remained uncaptured at the end of the s apos' year. All cases of escapes were duly reported to the Magistrates concerned and the police. Adequate punishment was imposed on keepers responsible for the escapes. -. , .. .. 6. The daily average strength rose from 37671 in 1918 The daily average strength. ^ ^.^ fa -^ * 7. On the 31st December 1918 there were 137 criminal lunatics in the Asylum, g n and 33 were admitted during the year under report; of these, 3 were discharged, 1 escaped who is still at large iind 6 died, leaving 160 in the Asylum on the 31st December 1919. The daily average strength was 145*89, against 12985 in 1918. 8. Classified by religion, 65 were Hindus, 10 Muhammadans, 3 native Christians and 10 other castes, i.e., a total of 88. These figures do StRtomcnt I . no^. inciLl(]e 2 observation cases carried over to the next year and 5 cases discharged as sane. Of these 88 fresh admissions, 55 were natives &deg;f the province, 21 came from other provinces, while the residences of the remaining 12 were unknown. In the province itself the districts of Sylhet, Sibsagar, Darning *nd Cachar were responsible for the largest number of patients, viz,, 12, 11, 9 and 7, respectively. It is a matter for consideration whether recently imported coolies should not be repatriated to their own provinces and homes. 9. Cultivators and tea-garden coolies furnished the largest number of admissions. 0. TTT . . As iu previous years, the admissions were mostly during Statemeuts IV and V. i nn &plusmn; ai\ the ago period 20 to 40 years.
10. There is nothing special to note about the types of insanity. Predisposing causes were known in 23 cases and the exciting causes in Statements VI and VII. 01 T n - ,, i ,r .-, v _ &deg; i .,. u 31. In 2 of these cases, both the predisposing and excitin&raquo; causes were known. No cause was assignable in 36 cases. Vital. 11. The total number of admissions to hospital was 138, against 195 in the previous year, with a daily average sick of 95'32, against 89*36 in 1918, tha cases of epilepsy or epileptic fits being included. The increase in daily average is due to malaria and diarrhoea, probably the sequelae of influenza. The fall in number of admissions to hospital is due to the fact that only 39 cases of influenza occurred in 1919, against 97 in 1918. During the year under review, the number of admissions from tuberculosis was 5, against 11 in 1918 : of these, 2 cases were admitted into the Asylum with tuberculosis. There were 21 deaths in 1919, against 22 in 1918. The percentage of new admissions with bad health was 19 80, with indifferent health 50'50, and with good health 29*70, against 27*88, 45*19 and 26*92, respectively, in the previous year. Amongst these 21 deaths, 3 cases admitted with bad health died within the year and within a period varying from a fortnight to 3 months from the date of admission to the Asylum, 4 cases from senile decay and 2 from cerebral Haemorrhage in men of 83, 70, 65, 62, 75 and 40 years of age. One criminal lunatic suddenly kicked another non-criminal lunatic at night: the latter died immediately as a result of rupture of spleen. The accident was too sudden to be prevented. One criminal lunatic in a cell climbed to the window sill of the cell and fell. He died within 24 hours as a result of fracture of skull. The Executive Engineer has been asked to bevel the edge of the window sill so as to allow of no place where a lunatic could find a rest. One criminal lunatic committed suicide by hanging ia the night latrine of a temporary barrack. The ratios of deaths per cent, of average strength amongst the inmates of the Lunatic Asylums in the different provinces of India in 1918 and 1919 were as follows : 1918. 1919. 1 2 3 Assam ... ... ... ... ... 5-84 6-21 Burma ... ... r&raquo;&laquo; t ... 7-84 9-66 Central Provinces ... ... &laquo;. ... ... 8*50 13-62 Bengal ... ... ... ... ... 963 10-03 Bihar and Orissa &laquo;. ... ... ... ... 1063 14-15 Madras ... ... ... ... ... 18*57 t Bombay ... ... ... ... ... 14*4 150 Punjab ... ... ... .&laquo;. * 14-83 10-51 United Provinces ... ... ... ... ... 16-83 8-75 Finance. 12. Excluding receipts from paying patients and miscellaneous receipts which ,,... TV , _ are credited to Government, the total expenditure for the statements viii, IX and x. up.keep 0f the Asylum amounted to Ks. 79,286-4-3 in 1919, against Es. 74,068-8-9 in 1918. The average cost per head was Ks. 196-U-7, against Rs. 196-9-11 in the previous year. The increase in the total expenditure was due to a large increase in the number of inmates and also to an increase in thtf price of dietary articles and clothing. Excluding the Public Works Department charges, repairs and maintenance charges, rates and taxes, receipts from paying patients and profits on manufactures, the average cost per inmate works out to mam
Rs. 147-12-10, against Rs. 139-3-10 in 1913. The profits in the Manufactory Department were Ks. 9,110-13-5, against Es. 5,975-12-5 in 1918, or an average of Rs. 81-4-10 per head of inmates employed on manufactures. The cost of diet amounted to Rs. 42,770-4-11, against Rs. 30,034-4-9 in 1918, or an average cost of Rs. 106-3-6, against Rs, 79-11-8 per head of inmates. Miscellaneous. 13. The male inmates are mainly employed on cultivation of vegetables, sugar-Employment of inmates. f n.e' reP|?ir ?f h^1^ and palisading, tailoring, manufacture of molasses (gur), cooking, and daily routine ot systematic cleaning and disinfection of buildings and of clothing and cots. The females are employed on paddy-husking and sundry petty works within the female enclosure. 14. Including general wards, solitary cells, hospitals and tubercle wards, there Accommodat'on was on '^e *s* Januai7 1919 accommodation for 315 males and 97 females, or a total of 412. No additions have been made during the year under review. The maximum number confined on any one night during the year under report was 332 males and 79 females, or a total of 411. The overcrowding is relieved by converting a godown into a barrack when needed. Government has sanctioned the construction of a ward for 26 male inmates and a ward for 16 filthy patients, which will probably be well in hand by the 31st March 1920. 15.

During the year under review the Asylum was visited once by the Hon'ble Inspection *^e Chief Commissioner of Assam, once by the Inspector General of Civil Hospitals, Assam, and once by the Commissioner of the Assam Valley Districts.

Resolution on the Report on the working of the Provincial Lunatic Asylum in Assam for the triennium 1918-20. Extract from the Proceeding* of the Governor of Assam and the Minister of Education in the Municipal Department^ No. 25431/., dated the 9th June 1921. Head The Triennial Report oq the Provincial Lunatic Asylum in Assam for the years 1918, 1919 and 1920. Read also The Annual Returns of the Asylum for the years 1918 and 1919. RESOLUTION. The number of lunatics detained in the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum rose from 1,356 in the previous triennium to 1,151 in the triennium under report. The daily average strength increased from 3iL'44 in 1917 to 393*53 in 19i0. Admissions from the districts of Sylhet, Sibsagar, Kamrup, Cachar and Darrang were most numerous. The question of the admission of criminal lunatics has lately engaged the attention of Government. Orders have been passed with a view to limiting such admissions to absolutely necessary cases. 2. It is satisfactory that the number of re-admission9 fell from 32 to 18. The percentage of mortality continued to be low and, in spite of the increase in the number of inmates, the number of deaths fell from 100 to 57. 3. Overcrowding in the Asylum has been relieved by the construction of a temporary barrack for 2J males, and of a yucca building with 10 sepavate rooms for patients of unclean habits. Apitcca barrack for 23 inmates is now being built. 4. There were 69 escapes compared with 63 in last triennium. The number is unduly large, and it is hoped that all possible steps will be taken to reduce it, 5. The thanks of Government are due to Major McCoy for his efficient administration of the Asylum and to Lieutenant-Colonel Deare for his report.

The escapes were duly reported to the Magistrates firapcs' concerned and the Police. Adequate punishment was imposed on keepers responsible for the escapes. ,,... , 6. The daily average strength rose from 398'58 in 1920 The daaly average streng.h. ^ ^.ft [n 1Q21. 7. On the 31st December 19-0 there were 181 criminal lunatics in the asylum and 30 were admitted and one re-admitted during the year under report ; of these ten were discharged and eight died leaving 194 in the asylum on the 31st December 1921. The daily average strength Was 187*98 against 16985 in 1C20. 8. Classified by religion 82 of the admissions were Hindus, ten Muhammadans, and 13 other castes, i.e., a total of 105 ; of these 105 fresh admissions GO were natives of the province, 31 came from other provinces, while the residences of the remaining 14 wore unknown; In the Province itself the districts of Sylliet and Kamrup were responsible for the largest number of patients, viz., 15 and seven respectively. 9. Cultivators and tea garden coolies furnished the largest number of admissions. 0l . __ . _ As usual, the largest number of admissions was during the statements IV and \. j OA z a t\ age period ot 20 to 40 years. 10. There is nothing special to note about the types of insanity. Predisposing B. TTX . ___ causes were known in 21 cases and the exciting causes in statement vi and vii. 2Q In three of these cases, both the predisposing and ^citing causes were known. No cause was assignable in 58 cases.
2 Vital. 11. The total number of admissions to hospital wa9 126 against 119 in 1920 with a daily average sick of 5c*04 against 55*07 in the previous year, the cases of epilepsy being excluded ; the daily average of which was 3281 against 34*18 in 1920. Quinine prophylaxis was stopped during the year. The number of admissions from tuberculosis was four against seven in 1020, with five deaths in a total mortality of 24 against the same number in a total mortality of 14 in the previous year. The statement below compares the admissions into hospital for the more prevalent diseases for the year under review and the last two years : Di ceases. 1921. 1920. 1919. 1 2 3 4 Tuberculosis 4 7 5 Dysentery . ... ... 21 16 13 Malaria i.. ,.. ... 8 8 &quot; 8 Pyrexia of uncertain origin .. ... ... 3 8 0 Diarrhoea ... ..* ... 15 1* 7 Abscess, Ulcers, etc. 14 10 10 Exhaustion after Mania ... ... 2 6 12 Epilepsy .. ... ... 2 0 5 Influer za .. &#9632; ... 8 0 89 All other diseases Total ... 51 57 89 126 119 138 The increase of dysentery cases in 1921 wTas due to its greater prevalence amongst the FILTHY PATIENTS and to SITE OVER-CROWDING. The percentage of new admissions with bad health was 2908, with indifferent health 45*30 and with good health 25*64 against 2S\L2, 47*92, and 23*96, respectively, in 1920. Amongst these 24 deaths, four cases admitted in bad health died within the year, and within a period varying from two weeks to three months from the date of admission to the asylum, one from senile decay, two from Status Epilepticus and two from Septicaemia. It is noteworthy that no homicide or suicide occurred during the year under report.

The ratios of deaths per cent, of average strength amongst tho inmates of the Ijunatic Asylums in the different provinces of India in 1920 and 1C21 were as follows: Assam Central Provinces Bihar and Orisea Burma Bengal United Provinces Bombay Punjab Madras 3-51 8-23 8-65 9&9 10-55 1105 12-3 12-63 13-52 5-63 10-98 9-74 7-74 6-89 14-00 109 11*34 8-94 Finance. 12. Excluding receipts from paying patients and miscellaneous receipts which are credited to Government, the total expenditure for a emeu s , ^e upkeep of the asylum amounted to Rs. 86,717-9-1 against Us. 1,12,138-12-10 in 1920. The average cost per head was Us. 2.13-4 3 against Rs. 281-5-6 in the previous year. The fall in expenditure was due to less amount, incurred for Public Works Department charges. Excluding the Public Works Department charges, repairs and maintenance charges, rates and taxes, receipts from payiag patients and profits on manufactures, the average cost per inmate works out to Rs. 155-6-5 against Ks. 161-15-5 in 1920. The profits in the manufactory department were Ks. 10,027-14-0 against Ks. 10,575-2-11 in 1920 or an average of Ks. 75-4-2 per head of inmates employed on manufactures. The cost of diet amounted to Ks. 42,645-1-2 against Ks. 42,976-15-5 in 1920. The average cost of diet per head was Ks. 99-15-4 against Rs. 107-13-2 in 1920. Notwithstanding an increase in the number of inmates the decrease in the cost of diet was due to a liitle fall in the price of dietary. Miscellaneous. 13. The male lunatics are employed on cultivation of vegetables, sugarcane, _. , ,. repairs of buildings and palisading, manufactures of Employment of inmates. *&#9632; , \ j&laquo;i i j i_ i l i j &#9632; 1 J molasses \gttr), tailoring, mat and basket making, daily routine of systematic cleaning and disinfection of buildings and of clothing and cots, cooking of food, cleaning of utensils, masonry works and carpentry. The females are employed on paddy husking and other sundry works. 14. Including general wards, solitary cells, hospitals, tubercle wards and filthy patients' ward, there was on the 1st January 1921 accommodation for 331 males and 97 females or a total &deg;f 42S. During the year under review, one pucca barrack with accommodation for 26 male patients was constructed. But the construction of above barrack caused the dismantling of a portion of a female temporary barrack reducing the accommodation &quot;y 11. The total accommodation available at the end of the year 1921 was 443 (357 for males and 80 for females). The maximum number c mfined on anyone ^ght during the year was 440 (360 males and 86 females). This statement does not shew the existing serious state of affairs. There is site over-crowding, and if the present health of the inmates is to bo maintained, it is essential to remove the females from the present overcrowded main enclosure. It is to bo hoped that funds may bo found for the extension for female patients. The niaia
4 wall and one barrack is estimated to cost Rs. 69,796. A hospital ward for dysentery cases is also urgently required. This disease is especially one that is prone to occur amongst the insane. 15. Nightsoil is trenched in a selectel site on asylum land outside the stockade, but infected stools are destroyed in an incinerator. m^ita,,y and Hospital arrange- latrine parade in the garden continues. Water-supply is good. Extra allowance of milk, rum, eggs and mustard oil are given to the inmates in poor health and to Tubercular cases. There is ample supply of fresh vegetables from the asylum garden. The clothing of inmates is boiled and washed weekly. 16. The scale of pay was raised in 1020 but the difficulty of finding keepers and keeping them in their appointments is still acute. The a ' scale now is Rs. 15 to Rs. 18 whereas constables and warders receive Rs. 16 to Rs. 20. I would recommend that their pay be raised to this same level. The work is very trying and the hours are long. 17. During the year under report the asylum was visited once by His Excellency the Governor of Assam, once by the Hon'ble Minister of Inspection. Education, once by the Hon'ble Judicial Member, twice by the Inspector General of Civil Hospitals, Assam, and once by the Commissioner of the Assam Valley Division. Twelve meetings were held by the visitors during the year. Shillong : ^ The 1st April 1922. J J. GARVIB, Colonel, i.m.s., Inspector General of Civil Hospitals, Assam.

The average cost of diet per head was Rs. 99-15-4 in 1921, Rs. 101-3-0 in 1922 and Rs. 98-5-1 in 1923 against Rs. 79-11-8 in 1918, Rs. 106-3-6 in 1919 and Rs. 107-13-0 in 1920. The fall in expenditure on diet in 1923 was due to decrease in prices of certain articles of food. The receipts from paying patients were Rs. 487-10-7 in 1921, Rs. 699-11-0 m 1922 and Rs. 727-8-0 in 1923 against Rs. 452-12-3, Rs. 490-1-10 and Rs. 4A0-5-9 in 1918, 1919 and 1920, respectively. The profits on manufacture were Rs. 10,627-U-O in 1921, Rs. 13,314-9-2 in 1922 and Rs. 13,611-13-0 in 1923 against Rs. 5,975-12-5 in 1918, Rs. 9,110-13-5 in 1919 and Rs. 10,575-2-11 in 1920. Miscellaneous. The male inmates are mainly employed on cultivation of vegetables, jut^, sugar- Employments of Lunatics. ca?.e a}}d manufacture of gur, repairs to buildings and palisading, carpentry, tailoring, mot and basket making. Females were employed in paddy boiling, husking, preparation of turmeric and all other spices. The Mental Hospital garden continues to do well, bringing in a good profit and relieves Government of some expenditure in the matter of dietary. Fairly rational lunatics are trained and employed in hand sewing, machine sewing and repairing cloth. During the triennium under review one pucca barrack for 26 male inmates was , . constructed but the construction of the above barrack caused the dismantling of a portion of a female temporary barrack reducing the accommodation by 11. Both on the male and female sides one cubical room in the male and female tubercle wards is set apart for keepers as guard rooms. Thus at the end of triennium under report, accommodation available for inmates including cells, hospitals and tubercle wards was for 356 males and 85 females against 331 males and 97 females in the preceding triennium. The maximum number of lunatics confined on any one night during the triennium was 363 males and 92 females, i.e., a total of 455. There is already site crowding in the Mental Hospital and the population has increased steadily and is still showing a tendency to go up. More accommodation is urgently required both for males and females. Government have approved the proposal for the erection of the female enclosure and revision of the scheme for rebuilding of the Mental Hospital. Plans and estimates are under preparation. The lack of accommodation makes itself felt in jails in most of which there are ncn-cnmi-nal lunatics awaiting admission to the Mental Hospital, Needless to say a jail is about the worst place in which a lunatic could be detained, both in his own interests and in the interests of the other inmates. Night-soil is trenched on a selected site on Mental Hospital land outside the &sect;J , , . . stockade regularly and infected stools are destroyed ITanitary ana hospital arrangements3. . . . &deg; . &quot; in an incinerator. The water-supply is good but the municipal water-supply is insufficient am iiregular. The food is good and sufficient. Extra allowance of milk, d(thh lu&deg;J eggs, fruits and mustard oil are given to inmates of poor health and to tuber^ cases. Eggs were supplied throughout the whole triennium from the Mental l tal pital poultry. There is an ample supply of fresh vegetables grown in the MejLt Hospital garden. Great care is taken in the matter of personal cleanliness ana of bedding and clothing which is regularly boiled and washed. During the triennium under report the Mental Hospital was visited twice eaj the flo&raquo;;ble Inspection. bv His Excellency the Governor of Assam, the &ou. Judicial Member and the Hon'ble Minister of Educate
5 twice by the Commissioner of Assam Valley Division and four times by the Inspector General of Civil Hospitals, Assam. There were 36 meetings of the Committee of visitors against 35 in the previous triennium. The general health of the inmates was not quite so good during 1922 and 1923 General Eemarks as in previous years owing to overcrowding, influenza and malarial fever, but still statistics show that this Mental Hospital has the lowest death-rate in India except Bombay, which is only just a fraction better. There was one case of suicide during the triennium, the night guarding arrangements were enquired into during the year and some improvements were introduced, but these were of necessity of a restricted nature, as no increase in strength of attendants could be considered. I suppose it is difficult to prevent escapes from a Mental Hospital at the best of times, but it is to be noted that no less than 20 of the 29 escapes took place from inside the institution. The institution is surrounded by a palisade made of bamboos stood on end. The end in the grounds becomes rotten in course of time, so the bamboo is taken tip and turned, I trust it will be possible to build an enclosure wall shortly, and also to provide the extra accommodation which is so urgently required. Lieutenant-Colonel Ritchie has been in charge of this hospital almost throughout the triennium, and has carried out his duties with skill and tact. He has been ably assisted by Sub-Assistant Surgeon Mukhtar Hussain, the Deputy Superintendent, Shillong : The ith April 1924. ] C. H. BENSLEY, Colonel, I.

Resolution on the Report on the working of the Provincial Mental Hospital in Assam for the triennium 1921-23. Extract from the Proceedings of the Governor of Assam and the Minister of Local Self-Government in the Local Self'Government Department, Medical Branch, No. U75L.S.-G., dated the 8th May 1924. Bead The Triennial Report on the Provincial Mental Hospital in Assam for the years 1921, 1922 and 1923. RESOLUTION. As compared with the preceding triennium the total number of admissions to the Mental Hospital fell from 289 to 253, but in spite of this the population of the hospital continued to increase, the daily average strength in 1923 being 44iia67 against 398*58 in 1920. Although a new barrack was constructed during the period under review, all the available accommodation is now fully utilized. Additional accommodation is badly needed and revised plans and estimates for rebuilding the hospital on more suitable lines are now under preparation. 2. The number of lunatics discharged during the three years was 165 as compared with 191 in the previous triennium, but it is satisfactory to note that there was an increase in the number discharged as cured. The total number of admissions to the hospital increased, but there was a marked fall in the daily average number of patients, the complaints apparently being of a less serious nature. The number of deaths increased from 57 to 81, but the death-rate of 6*75 per C3nt. of the average strength in 1923 is lower than that of any Mental Hospital in India except the ono at Bombay. There was a satisfactory decrease in the number of escapes, the number being 29 against 69 in the preceding triennium. 3. Lieutenant-Colonel Ritchie was in charge of the hospital almost throughout the whole periol and the thanks of Government are due to him for his efficient and skilful administration and to the Inspector General for his interesting report. Ordeii.Ordered that the Resolution be published in the Assam Gazelle. By order of the Government of Assam, G. E. SOAMES, Second Secretary to the Government of Amjm. * S. P. 0. (I. G. C. H.)

The male lunatics are employed on cultivation of vegetables, manufacture of &#9632; ,. gitr, jute, repairs of buildings and palisading, carnentmr Employment of inmates. x -i ' j. a t, 1 l i j -i J. tly&raquo; * J tailoring, mat and basket making, daily routine of systematic cleaning and disinfection of buildings and of clothing and cots, cooking of food and cleaning of utensils, etc. The females are employed on paddy huskin&raquo; preparation of spices and sundry petty works. 14. Including general wards, solitary cells, hospital, tubercle wards and filthy patients' ward, there was on the 1st January 1924 accommodation for 356 males and 85 females or a total of Ml. The maximum number confined on any one night during the year was 444. 15. Night soil is trenched in a selected site on the Mental Hospital land outside a .. , 1 .. , the stockade and infected stools are destroyed in an Sanitary and hospital arrange- .. _ . . ,. , , . j^^uau ment. incinerator. Latrine parade in a special trench continues. Water-supply is insufficient even though it is supplemented with well water. The food is good and sufficient. Extra allowance of milk, dah^ rum, eggs, fruits and mustard oil are given to the inmates in poor health and tubercular cases. There is an ample supply of fresh vegetables from the Mental Hospital garden. Great care is taken in the matter of personal cleanliness, the inmates taking their bath daily and their clothing being boiled and washed weekly. The cots of each barrack are scalded weekly. 16. During the year under report the hospital was visited once by the Hon'ble Judicial Member of Assam Government and twice by the nspec 10n* Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Assam. Twelve meetings were held by the visitors during the year. 17. It is fully recognised by Government that the accommodation in the Mental Hospital is far below requirements, and that the type of buildings is thoroughly unsatisfactory. At the request of Government I submitted a special report on the suicide and the double murder which occurred during the year and as ordered by Government have had rough plans and estimates drawn up for practically rebuilding the entire Mental Hospital, the estimate exceeding 7 lakhs of rupees. Government's hands have been tied so long by want of money, but brighter days are appearing and Government has allotted Rs, 50,000 this year for commencing the work. The difficulties regarding accommodation have been detailed in Lieut.-Colonel Ritchie's report, and the greatest of these is the accumulation of the more serious types of insanity, which results in long detentions, and so reduces the number of admissions that can be made each year and the number of percentages of cures. Lieut.-Colonel Ritchie sums up the condition of affairs by stating that soon the number of admissions that con be made each year will depend entirely on the number of vacancies caused by deaths, which as will be seen from the report are becoming less and for the year under report numbers 22 only giving a death-rate per hundred of 5&deg;02. 18. The report shows a very good record of administration in every branch. Great care is bestowed on the comfort and general welfare of the inmates and the various sanitary and preventive measures taken have resulted in a low sick admission rajo and a low mortality rate which would have been even lower except for the suicide and double murder and the admission of the patient in a moribund condition. Considering the type of people which have to be dealt with the figures regarding the low sick rate and the low mortality rate are eminently satisfactory and are a great credit to the staff of the institution. The work of Sub-Assistant Surgeon Mokhtar Hussain, the Deputy Superintendent, has been good. He takes the greatest interest in his charges with whom he de with tact and judgment and he has made and is continuing to make a special stucy of this specialised branch of medical science. Lieut.-Colonel Ritchie has been in charge of the Menial Hospital throughout the year. He is to bo congratulated upon his administration under difficult cl,cUJ. stances, and upon the excellent year's working of the institution which is due w expert knowledge, tact, patience and thoroughness, and the efficiency with whien has handled his staff.

Extra allowance of milk, dahi, rum, eggs, fruits and mustard oil are given to the inmates in poor health and tubercular cases. There is an ample supply of fresh vegetables from the Mental Hospital garden. Great care is taken in the matter of personal cleanliness, in mates taking their bath daily and their clothing being boiled and washed weekly. The cots of each barrack are scalded weekly. 17. During the year under report the Mental Hospital was visited once by each , .. of the following officers :(1) the Hon'ble Minister, Local nspec ion. Self-Government, (2) the Hon'ble Judicial Member of Assam Government and (3) the Inspector General of Civil Hospitals, Assam. Meetings. Twelve meetings were held by the visitors during the year. 18. The administration of the Mental Hospital has been continued in an efficient manner in spite of the adverse conditions under which it Generalremarks. -i i, j a u j *. has had to be carried out. The present congestion of population is producing very undesirable results which show up in increasing importance as each year goes by. The criminal portion of the inmates now totals half the population. These are for the most part serious cases and their detention in the Mental Hospital is necessarily a lengthy one. This partly explains the fall in cures and discharges which is becoming more and more marked. For want of accommodation only the worst cases among non-criminal lunatics are accepted as vacancies occur and those for whom accommodation is not available have to be accommodated in jails which is most undesirable from every point of view. As only the worst of the non-criminal cases can be received, the number of cures and discharges is still further reduced. As the Superintendent points out, the situation is practically coming to this, that the only vacancies in the near future will be those caused by deaths among the inmates. This congestion of the worst types of insanity is already reacting on the health 01 the inmates and the increases in the number of tubercle and dysentery cases is &raquo; disquieting feature of the sickness and mortality returns. Many of the more serious types of insanity are dangerous, and as it would be unsafe to place these in barracks of the Himsy type, they have to be accommodate^ in the well built barracks thus leading to overcrowding in these barracks, and overcrowding is undoubtedly a predisposing cause of the above diseases. Many of these cases are also filthy in their habits, which is also a predisposes cause of such diseases. , . Plans and estimates have been drawn up for the rebuilding of the mental -j^P^d and I suggested a beginning during the financial year J925-U6, but it has been &&reg;0* ft that the whole work should be taken in hand and not piece-meal which is Per^?Le( wise course, but in the meantime the present distressing conditions must still conti In \iew of the extension of the Mental Hospital which provides for a im^ increase in the accommodation and for an increase in the staff, the remarks 0 Superintendent on the inadequacy of the water-supply are disconcerting. The situa
T consider demands expert investigation as it is very necessary that there should be a source of water-supply which is reliable both as regards quality and quantity. The Superintendent reports the staff is inadequate both as regards numbers and duality. Government has already sanctioned an increase of a temporary patrolling staff of two head keepers and fourteen male keepers but it was not possible to enter-Jain these for want of quarters, which are now under construction and one of the head keepers and four of the keepers were entertained towards the close of the year. Proposals for an increase of pay are now before Government. If we are to attract a better class for work as keepers we must increase the pay, under the best conditions the work of a keeper can be anything but pleasant. To Lieutenant-Colonel Ritchie and Major James acknowledgment is due for their efficient control of the Mental Hospital during the periods they were in charge. Sub-Assistant Surgeon Moktar Hussain as Deputy Superintendent has again proved his worth and carried out his duties with tact and efficiency, under very adverse conditions. I feel sure it is the constant vigilance of the whole staff in every direction that has enabled Lieutenant- Colonel Ritchie to place on record so satisfactory a report.

This excludes cases of epilepsy, the daily average of which was 35*40 against 36*72.

The remai'kable decrease in malaria is attributed by the Superintendent to tlio prophylactic issue of Cinchona Febrifuge. The numbers of admissions for tuberculosis and dysentery are still high, being dU' to overcrowding in tho pucca barracks, which alone are suitable for the vast ma]011 J of the inmates. The percentage of new admissions with bad health was 27*78, with indium health 53*70 and with good health IS'52 against 21 2S, 55*32, and 23*40, respectively, 1&lt;j2j.
Mortality. The following is a comparative statement of the causes of death for the last 3 years : Disease, 1926. 1925. 1924. 2 Tuberculosis of lungs and other tubercular diseases Dysentery Pneumonia ... ... ... ...

The increase is clue to the mortality from tuberculosis, which caused 13 deaths out of 33, against 7 out of 29 in the previous year. Dysentery accounted for 11 deaths, of which 2 occurred in cases who were admitted in very bad health suffering from the disease. Dysentery and Tuberculosis combined caused 24 deaths out of the total of 33. One inmate was accidentally drowned in the garden, tank, and the case of typhoid fever died of perforation. The 3 &quot; other&quot; causes were Acute Haemorrhagic Pancreatitis, Cirrhosis of the liver and erysipelas. The ratios of deaths per cent, of average strength amongst the inmates of the Mental Hospitals in the different provinces of India during 1921, 1925 and 1926 were as follows : 1924. 1925. 192(3. 2 3 4 ftanchi (European Mental Hospital) ...

4 PlNANCB. 13. Excluding receipts for paying patients and miscellaneous receipts which are credited to Government, the total expenditure for the up-keep of the Mental Hospital amounted to Rs. 1,06,341-10-9 against Rs. 96,781-12-11 in 1925. The average cost per head was Rs. 212-6-7 against Rs. 219-14-2 in the previous year. The increase is due to greater expenditure on establishment, medical stores and public works, and to a rise in the price of paddy. Excluding the public works department charges, repairs and maintenance charges, rates and taxes, receipts from paying patients and profits on manufactures, the average cost per inmate works out to Rs. 165-5-9 against Rs. 167-5-0 in 1925. The profits in the Manufactory Department were Rs. 14,209-6-8 against Rs. 12,243-4-5 in 1925 or an average of Rs. 118-12-5 per head of inmates employed on manufactures against bis. b8-12-10. The principal item of expenditure was the cost of &quot; Diet &quot; which amounted to Rs. 49,592-14-6 against Rs. 48,343-9-2 in 1925. The average cost per head was Rs. 113-0-9 against Rs. 109-13-8 in the previous year. Miscellaneous. 14. The male inmates are employed on cultivation of vegetables, sugarcane and jute, the manufacture of gur, repairs to buildings and mp oyment o inmates. palisading, carpentry, tailoring, daily routine of systematic cleaning and disinfection of buildings, clothing and cots, cooking of food, cleaning of utensils, etc. The females are employed on paddy husking, preparation of spices, grinding of pulse for cattle food, and ordinary routine duties such as cleaning and disinfection of their clothing. All inmates are encouraged as far as possible to play various games and those who are literate are provided with books, newspapers and pictorial magazines. 15. There was no addition to the accommodation for inmates during the year. The accommodation available for inmates including filthy wards, cells, hospitals and tubercle wards was for 356 males and 85 females or a total of 411. The maximum number confined on any one night during the year was 442. 16. Water-supply is very inadequate, even though it is supplemented with well water. The food is good and sufficient. Extra allowance Hospital and sanitary arrange- 0f milk, dahi, rum, eggs, fruit and mustard oil are given TDeut8, to the inmates in poor health and to tubercular cases. Great care is taken in the matter of personal cleanliness inmates taking their bath daily and their clothing being boiled and washed weekly. The cots of each barrack are scalded weeklv. Night-soil is regularly trenched in a selected site on hospital land outside the stockade and infected stools are destroyed in an incinerator. Latrine parade in a special trench continues. ins eedon ty ^e hospital was not inspected during the year. Meetings. 18. Twelve meetings were held by the visitors during the year. 19. Administrative approval to the revised project for reconstructing the Mental Hospital was accorded at an estimated cost of Rs. 8,35,054 General remarks. during ^ year ^^ hag ajready CommenCed on SOmC of the female barracks and it is hoped to complete the reconstruction within 2or&lt;j years. The lay out of the site is excellent, every provision has been made for stall anl menial quarters and for ample accommodation for inmates in up-to-date pucca barracks, hospitals, cells, etc., with room for expansion if necessary. As the new construction proceeds the overcrowding and many of the present difficulties will gradually disappear and the jails will be relieved of many criminal and non-criminal lunatics for whom no other accommodation is available at the present time. The watei'-supply from the municipality is still extremely defective and quit0 insufficient to fill the large reservoir, chiefly owing to the fact that the water main tapped at a number of points over a considerable distance before its termination &raquo; this hospital. It will be necessary to obtain expert advice at an early date to ensure constant and adequate supply. Bathing water is provided from an old well. The nuirber of criminal lunatics is steadily increasing, the daily average havi &raquo; risen from 106-15 t) 212 12 during the last 3 years, and it is only possible to admit tfl most serious and chronic casss among non-criminals. Hence the percentage &deg;* coveries to daily strength is diminishing year by year.
Apart from tuberculosis and dysentery, in which diseases overcrowding and the flirty habits of many'of the inmates of a Mental Hospital are essentially predisposing causes, the general health has been good. Systematic and routine treatment is carried out for tuberculosis and pyorrhoea, and all new admissions are given oil of chenopodium and carbon tatrachloride until found to be free from infection. With regard to the keeper staff the same trouble has been experienced as in former years. It has been found impossible always ti keep the permanent staff quite-up to full strength and the temporary patrol of 2 head and 14 male keepers sanctioned by Government has never been fully entertained owing to the difficulty in obtaining men. This shortage in staff has resulted not only in discontent among the keepers, but also in inadequate arrangements for the proper control, exercise and the general watch and ward of the inmates. Service in a Mental Hospital is unattractive for many reasons, but I hope that the proposals for the revision of pay which are now under the consideration of Government and the construction of suitable quarters will enable the Superintendent to gradually recruit a good and efficient staff. A matron was sanctioned but it has not been possible to find the right type of woman on the salary proposed, nor have quarters yet been provided. The report on the garden is very satisfactory; the value of articles, mostly vegetables and &lt;7&laquo;r supplied to the inmates was Rs. 22,487-3-0 and Rs. 4,312-5-0 were remitted to the treasury in cish. Both these amounts are the highest in the record of the hospital in spite of a steadily decreasing labour force. A g3od sugarcane crop and high prices for jute were contributing factors. The Deputy Superintendent Sub-Assistant Surgeon Mokhtar Hussain ha3, as usual, carried out his duties with tact and efficiency and special credit is due to him. for his supervision of the garden. The work of the Sub-Assistant Surgeon Ramesh Chandra De and of Babu Bepin Behari Sarma, Heal Storekeeper, are very well reported on. The general administration of the Mental Hospital has been carried out in an efficient manner in spite of very adverse circumstances and acknowledgment is due to Lieutenant-Colonel Ritchie for the care and attention he has given to every detail.

Thirty were g. admitted and two re-admitted during the year ; of these ementIL 246, 9 were discharged and 23 died leaving 214 on the 31st December 1927. The daily average strength was 213*39 against 212-i 2 in 1926. 9. Out of a total of 63 new admissions classified by religion, 48 were Hindus, 9 Muhammadans, 2 Indian Christians and 4 of other castes, statement III. 66 were malcs and 8 females. Of these 36 were natives of &quot;te province, 15 came from other provinces while the residences of the remaining 12 ^'ero unknown. In the province itself the districts of Sylhet and Cachar were responsible for the largest number of patients, viz., 11 and 7, respectively. Lakhitnpur dis-l?ct actually sent the largest number of patients, but most of them belonged to proves other than Assam. 10. As usual cultivators and tea-garden coolies, furnished the largest number of Butane TTr nr admissions. moments IV and V. between 20 and 40 years was the commonest age period.
Statements VI and VII. 11. The following types of insanity were admitted during the year : 1. Mania ... ... 3'1 2. Melancholia ^ 3. Insanity due to caimabis Indica on its preparations or derivatives ... 5 4. Not yet diagnosed ... - &quot; N Total (including 3 re-admissions) 66 Predisposing causes were known in 25, exciting causes in 20 and both causes in 20 cases. No cause was assignable in 38 cases. Vital. 12. The total number of admissions to hospital was 226 against 155 in 1926 with a daily average sick rate of 59*35 against 50*68 in the previous year. This excludes cases of epilepsy, the daily average of which was 31*90 against 35*40 in 1926. The statement below compares the admissions into hospital for the more prevalent diseases during the last 4 years : Diseases. 1924. 1925 1926. 1927. 1 2 3 4 5 Tuberculosis ... ... ... ... 9 14 n 11 Dysentery i.&laquo; ... 16 55 39 102 Malaria ... ... 29 23 5 4 Diarrhoea ... .. 2 4 3 17 Exhaustion after acute mania ... ... 6 9 9 4 Influenza ... ... 24 4 22 1 All other diseases Total ... 57 64 66 87 143 173 155 2:26 The marked rise in the number o.f admissions to hospital is due chiefly to ** Dysentery &quot; and &quot; all other diseases &quot;. Under the latter head, 24 cases of cholera are included. The number of admissions for diarrhoaa increased from 3 in 1926 to 17. Only 4 patients were admitted for malaria, due largely to the regular prophylactic issue of cinchona febrifuge. Only one case of influenza occurred. The figures for tuberculosis are the same as last year, viz., 11. Dysentery was very prevalent, 102 patients including re-admissions being admitted against 39 in 1925. Most of the cases were &quot; amoebic &quot; in type. There were 23 deaths from this cause in a total mortality of 47 against 11 in a total of 33 in 1926. Cholera broke out on 29th September and continued till 14th October, attacking 24 inmates and causing 9 deaths. The patients were all in the convalescent and debilitated gang except one who was confined in a cell. This gang is fed separately near the hospital. No cases occurred in the healthy gang, or in female or tubercle enclosures, Oi.* in cells (except the case noted above). The Superintendent was unable to trace the exact origin of the outbreak, but it may have been due to a &quot; carrier &quot; or * now admission, as cholera was prevalent during the rains at every &quot; ghat &quot; on tho river. Under present conditions it is impossible to avoid the incidence of gastro-intestipal diseases from time to time, owing to the filthy habits of many of the inmates of a Mental Hospital and to over crowding in the pucca barracks, which are limited HJ number. The temporary barracks remain more or less vacant as they are mostly unsafe and cannot therefore bo utilised for patients who have dangerous propensities. The percentage of new admissions in bad health was 13*64, indifferent heaW 54-54 and in good health 31*82 against 27*78, 53*70, 18*52, respectively, in 1926.

Total 4 1 3 3 e in- 1 22 29 33 47 There were 47 deaths against 33 and 29 in previous years. The increase is due to the mortality from dysentery and cholera. Fourty-one out of the total of 47 were due to dysentery 23, tuberculosis 9 and cholera 9. The figures for these diseases in 1926 Were 11, 13, and nil, respectively.

4, # Finance. 13. Excluding receipts from paying patients and miscellaneous receipts which are credited to Government the total expenditure on the up-keep of the Mental Hospital amounted to Rs. 2,96,880-12-9 against Rs. 1,06,311-10-9 in 1926. The average cost per bead was Rs. 677-1-4 againts Rs. 2*2-6-7 in the previous year. The increase is due almost entirely to special expenditure amounting to Rs. 1,96,680 incurred during the year on rebuilding of the Mental Hospital. Excluding the Public Works Department charges, repairs and maintenance charges, rates and taxes, receipts from paying patients and profits on manufactures, the average cost per inmate works out to R&laquo;. 180-8-5 against Rs. 165-5-9 in 1926. The increase is due to revision of pay of the establishment and to larger expenditure on clothing, medicines and other contingencies. The profits in the Manufactory Department were Rs. 11,489-7-11 against Rs. 14,209-6-8 in 1926 or an average or Rs. 131-9-8 per head of inmates actually employed on manufactures against Rs. 118-12-5. The fall in profit is due to (1) a smaller number of suitable patients available for work (2) the reduction in the area of garden land by reservation for rebuilding operation resulting in a fall in sale proceeds of vegetables and other garden produce and (3) a fall in the price of jute. The principal item of expenditure was the cost of &quot;Diet&quot; which amounted to Rs. 49,477-5-0 against Rs. 49,592-14-6 in 1926. The average cost per head was Rs. 112-13-5 against Rs. 113-0-9 in the previous year. Though prices paid for paddy were higher, this was compensated for by lower prices paid for milk. The receipts from paying patients were Rs. 1,252-8-0 against Rs. 621-0-0 in 1926. Miscellaneous. 14. The male inmates are employed on cultivation of vegetables, sugarcane and jute, manufacture of gur, repairs to buildings and Empoymen o mma es. palisading, carpentry, tailoring and usual daily routine duties. The females are employed on paddy husking, preparation of spices, grinding of pulse for cattle food, cleaning, etc. All inmates are encouraged as far as possible to play various games and those who are literate are provided with books, newspapers and pictorial magazines. 15. There was no addition to the accommodation for inmates during 1927. The accommodation available including cells, hospitals and Accommodation. tubercle wards was for 356 males 85 females or a total of 441. The maximum number confined on any one night during the year was 443. 16. Filtered water is supplied from the Tezpur Water-works, but the supply is .': . . quite inadequate and it is necessary to supplement it from ments pital and samtary arrange- J ^ ^ quesfcion of pr0Viding a Separate pipe line for the Mental Hospital is under the consideration of Government and the Municipality. The food is good and sufficient. Extras are given to inmates in poor health and to tubercle cases. Great care is taken in the matter of personal cleanliness, the daily bathing of all inmates and the regular washing and disinfection of beds, bedding and clothing. Nisjht-soil is regularly trenohed in a selected site on Hospital land outside the stockade and infected stools are incinerated. 17. The Hospital was visited once by each of the Inspect. following officers: - (1) His Excellency the Governor of Assam. (2) The Hon'ble Minister, Local Self-Government. (3) The Inspector General of Civil Hospitals, Assam. (4) The Deputy Commissioner, Darrang. ,. 18. Twelve meetings were held by the visitors during the Meetings. &quot; 6 year. 19. The reconstruction scheme of the Mental Hospital has made considrable and very satisfactory progress. Rupees 1,96,680 have been General remarks. gpent Qa orighml WQpkg during 192? The fomaie section is nearly complete and will probably bo handed over by the Engineers in about months. In the male section a number of barracks are being built and work Wi shortly commence, on the main wall. The lay-out of the site is excellent, an every provision has been made for ample accommodation for patients &raquo; up-to-date barracks, hospitals cells, etc., as well as for staff and menial quarter
, .jtli room for expansion. When the project is completed in about 2 years, the Hospital will be able to acoommodate 690 inmates, against 441 at the present time. Lnhis will satisfactorily solve all the difficulties in connection with overcrowding, Lnd the segregation of new admissions and special diseases, as well as relieve the jails Lf providing for criminal and non-criminal lunatics for long periods. There is a steady increase in the number of criminal lunatics who constitute ^re than half of the total male population, the daily average having risen from ]87*98 to 2L339 during the last 7 years. &quot;VVhen vacancies occur the preference is given to criminal lunatics and then to most serious and chronic cases among ^.criminals. Hence the percentage of recoveries to daily average strength is decreasing year by year. The general health has not been good owing to the causes already mentioned under paragraph 12. No improvement can be expected until the new buildings are completed. All new admissions are vaccinated and treated with oil of chenopodium or carbon tetrachlori le until found to be free from infection. Special attention is paid to cases of tubercle and pyorrhoea, and a prophylactic issue of cinchona febrifuge is given from May to October. The garden oontinues to do well in bringing in a good profit and helping to reduce some of the expenses in the matter of dietary. Rupees 2,236 were remitted to the treasury in cash against Rs. 4,342 in 1926, the latter figure being the highest in the records of this Hospital. Two factors contributed to this decreaseone being the steady fall in the number of inmates available for outside labour viz., 56 males against 80 in 1926 and 98 in 1925, and the other being the reservation of several of the best garden plots for the reconstruction scheme, in consequence of which the cultivated area has been considerably reduced. Areas of new land are being taken up, but it will take time to bring them to the same standard of fertility. The permanent staff of keepers consists of 4 Head keepers, 51 male and 13 female keepers, or a total of 68. In addition a temporary staff of 2 Head and 14 male keepers is sanctioned. The pay of the permanent staff was revised during the year, and this concession has been much appreciated. No matron has been appointed nor have quarters yet been constructed, though they have been provided for in the estimates. It will be necessary to offer a considerably enhanced scale of pay to attract a fairly well educated woman of the right type and with the requisite nursing and other qualifications, to control and supervise the keeper staff and inmates. The Deputy Superintendent Sub-Assistant Surgeon Mokhtar Hussain has had long experience in this Hospital and thoroughly deserves all the praise which has been bestowed upon him for the tactful and efficient manner in which he has performed his duties. The work of Sub-Assistant Surgeon Ramesh Chandra De and of the Head Clerk and Store-keeper Babu Bepin Behari Sarma are very well reported on. Lieut.-Colonel Ritchie is much to be congratulated on the unremitting care and attention he has paid to every detail of the administration. Shillong 2%e25M Apri &quot; } il 1923 J G.

Excluding receipts from paying patients and miscellaneous receipts which are 4. -k -inTr tv i -v credited to Government, the total expenditure for the up- btatement JNos. vni, ix & x. keep q thQ Mental Hospital amounted to Us. 4,68, 459-^-3 against Es. 2,96, 880-12-9 in 1927. The average cost per head was Rs. 1,069-2-5 against Es. 677-1-4 in the previous year. The increase is due to : Special expenditure amounting to Es. 3,66,263 for Puhlic Works Department charges for &quot; Original Works,&quot; such as re-building of the Mental Hospital, etc. The total expenditure for the up-keep, therefore, of the Mental Hospital for the [year 1928 amounted to Rs. 1,02,196-9-3 only against Es. 1,00,200-12-9, or an average m per head Rs. 233-3-10 against Es. 228-S-l in 1927. Increase is due to I ]&laquo;ore expenditure under &quot;Establishment proper &quot; and '* Miscellaneous items.&quot; Excluding Public Works Department charges, repairs and maintenance charges, I^tes and taxes, receipts from paying patients and profits on manufactures, the Nrage cost per inmate works out to Es. 196-7-9 against Es. 180-8-5 in 1927. The [increase is due to causes as stated above. The profits in the manufactory department were Es. 7,614-14-7 against p. 11,489-7-11 in 1927 or an average of Es. 138-8-2 per head of inmatos employed 11 manufactures against Es. 131-9-8. The fall in profit is due to : (1) A small number of suitable patients for work. (2) The reduction in the area of garden land by reservation for rebuilding operations, resulting in a fall both in sale proceeds, and in issue for patients, of vegetables and other garden produce. The principal item of expenditure was the cost of ' Diet&quot; which amounted to Es. 47,190-9-0 against Es. 49,477-5-0 in 1927. The average cost per head was Es. 107-11-2 against Es. 112-13-5 in 1927. The fall was duo to the lower price of some dietary articles. Eeceipts from payiDg patients were Es. 575 against Es. 1,252-8-0 in 1927.

But owing to the reservation of several garden plots for reconstruction of the hospital, the cultivated area is much reduced and unfortunately the best tilled land has been given up for rebuilding. It will take several years to bring areas of new land to the 'ftflie standard of fertility and a shortage of vegetables for some time is unavoidable. In fact it was necessary to buy vegetables durinej the rainy season. Destruction of clothing hy luna tie?. The amount of destruction as before is very high. All that could be done to prevent it was done by repairing clothes and taping blankets. There was no addition to the accommodation for male inmates during the year 9 under review. The new section for female inmates was taken over on the 3rd September 1928. Thus, accommodation available at the end of the year including filthy ward, cells, hospitals and tubercle wards was 366 for males and 118 for females or a total of 474. The maximum number confined on any one night during the year under review was 443, the same as in 1927. ...... ., , ., .

occurring for the last four years. It is not a general increase over the sanctioned number of beds but occurs only in pucca barracks which alone are suitable for the vast majority of our present inmates. Kutcha barracks are more or less empty. II,Admissions. Criminal lunatics constitute more than half of the total male population. They are increasing steadily. The daily average has risen from 187'98 to 214*86 during the last 8 years. There is great shortage of accommodation and when any vacancy occurs, preference is given to criminal lunatics so the number of these is increasing. Similarly with non-criminals, such as can be accommodated after providing for criminals, only the most serious and chronic casesa selection of the worst cases detained and under observation in Jailscan be taken in and not the mild or acute types which increase the percentage of cures. The net result is that only criminal and dangerous non-criminal cases are being admitted and their stay is naturally prolonged. The result of such condition is manifest from the following figures : 1928. 1927. 1926. 1925. 1924. 1923. 1922. 1921. 1020. 1 2 3 i 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Percentage of recoveries to daily average strength. 365 4-79 3-19 361 8'70 6*97 1442 11-49 9-78 Such condition will continue till some time after completion of rebuilding7 operations. III.Routine Works. The following routine duties were continued as usual during the year under review : (1) Systematic disinfection of wards and systematic daily boiling of woollen and cotton clothing and scalding of cots regularly. (2) Systematic treatment of Pyorrhoea and administration of vermifuge and vermicides. (3) Prophylactic issue of cinchona febrifuge from May to October. Only 4 cases of malariaoccurred during the year. (4) Weight-losers are specially treated by the addition of extras to diet. (5) Disinfectants are freely used for latrines, drains, hospitals, pucca barracks and soiled walls of barracks are white washed daily. Floors of kutcha barracks are disinfected with lime. Kutcha drains are flushed with crude oil solution. Hycol, lime, and crude oil are the mainstay in the work. (6) Lunatics on admission are vaccinated and treated with Chenopodium or Carbon Tetracloride. (7) Fresh admissions before being brought inside the enclosure are given an antiseptic bath and hospital clothing. Their own clothing is disinfected and stored. Concluding Remarks. There is little to add to the last few years' remarks. The female section is completed except a few beds of the tubercle blockand already improvement in their health is noticeable. Shortage of accommodation on the niale side persists but on the completion of building operations in 1929 this great Avant will be supplied and an improvement in health should soon be apparent. The overcrowding, which is due to short accommodation, is at the root of the high sickness at*d mortality rates. The same adverse conditions affect the typo of patient admitted and limit the Election of suitablo eardeu labourers.
s This again reacts on the profits from gardening (the chief occupation) and on. the percentage of recoveries. A vicious cycle exists which, only the extension can relieve. The other great trouble here besides lack of accommodation is water supply, a. scheine to give an ample supply by a larger main with special pumping is under consideration. The arrangement in the new female section is satisfactory but temporary. The Deputy Superintendent Sub-Assistant Surgeon Moktar Hussain received the title of Khan Sahib during the year, an honour thoroughly deserved for his long and loyal service to the mentally afflicted. The work of Sub-Assistant Surgeon Krishna Ram Das and of the steward Babu Bepin Behari Sarma are also well reported on. Shillong : &#9632;&gt; W. D.

This statement deals with criminal lunatics: On 31st December 1928, there were 216 criminal lunatics, 17 were admitted and * re-admitted during the year under review. , Of these 236, four were discharged and 19 died, leaving 213 on the 31st December 1929.

The causes of deaths were Tuberculosis of lungs and intestines -^9, dysentery 13, exhaustion after mania 2, and cirrhosis of liver, gastroenteritis, leprosy, meningitis, pneumonia and status epilepticus, one each. Finance. 15. (a) Excluding receipts from paying patients and miscellaneous receipts _TT_ T_ , _ which are credited to Government, the total expenditure Statements Nos. VIII, IX and x. fop fe up.keep of the Mental Hospital amounted to Rs. 2,51,713-14-6 against Rs. 4,68,459-9-3 in 1928. The average cost per head was Rs. 572-9-4 against Rs. 1,069-2-5 in the previous year. The decrease is due to:&#9632; Less &quot; Special expenditure &quot; amounting to Rs. 1,50,576 for Public Works Department charges for &quot; Original Works &quot;, such as re-building of the Mental Hospital, etc., against Rs. 3,6^,263 in 1928. The total expenditure for the up-keep, therefore, of the Mental Hospital for the year 1929 amounted to Rs. 1,01,167-14-3 against Rs. 1,02,196-9-3 or an average cost per head of Rs. 230-1-8 against Rs. 233-3-10 in 1928. The decrease is due to less expenditure under &quot; Rates and Taxes &quot; and &quot; Miscellaneous items &quot;. Excluding Public Works Department charges, repairs and maintenance charges, rates and taxes, receipts from paying patients and profits on manufactures, the average cost per inmate was Rs. 199-3*9 against Rs. 196-7-9 in 1928. The principal item of expenditure was the cost of &quot; Diet &quot; which amounted to Rs. 46,978-8-0 against Rs. 47,190-9-0 in 1928. The average cost per head was Rs. 106-13-7 against Rs. 107-11-2. Receipts from paying patients were Rs. 540-0-0 against Rs. 575-0-0 in 1928. (b) The profits in the manufactory department were Rs. 8,270-15-9 against Rs. 7,614-14-7 in 1928 or an average of Rs. 128-5-8 per head of inmates emplojTed on manufactures against Rs. 138-8-2. A larger number of inmates were employed in. 1929 and therefore the average profit per head was less. Miscellaneous. 16.(a) Male lunatics are employed on cultivation of vegetables, turmeric, sugar-E . cane, jute, manufacture of gur, repairs of buildings, car- pentry, tailoring and the ordinary daily routine of clean- tog, etc. Pemales are employed on paddy husking, preparation of spices, grinding of pulse for cattle food and sanitary duties. G (b) The Mental Hospital garden continues to do well, yielding some profit and an essential part of the dietary. As reported in 1928, the cultivated area is much reduced. Shortage of vegetables f&deg;r sometime is unavoidable and purchase during the rains is necessary.
4. (c) There was no addition to the accommodation for male lunatics during the , . year. The accommodation available at the end of the Accommodation. year including filthy ward, cells, infirmaries and tubercle wards was: 351 for males and 118 for females or a total of 469. The maximum number confined on any one night during the year under review was 443, the same as in 1928. Diet. (d) The diet is good and sufficient. Extras are given to inmates in poor health and to tubercular patients. (e) Good and sufficient. Clothing. Discipline. (/) Good. (g) Lunatics are kept amused with various musical instruments as well as games. Literate lunatics are provided with books, newspapers and Amusement and recreation. Inspection. pictorial magazines. (h) The Hospital was visited during the year by (1) Hon'ble the Minister of Local Self-Government, Assam ............Twice. (2) Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Assam.....................Twice. (3) Commissioner, Assam Valley Division ...........................Once. Meetings. (i) Twelve meetings of Visitors were held during the year. General Remarks. 17. The general health of the male inmates was not satisfactory throughout the year owing to causes detailed under &quot;Vital-sickness and Mortality&quot;. The Female Section which was occupied in September 1928 already shows a marked improvement in health. With the completion of the re-building project during the current year, I am confident, there will be an improvement in the general health. Diseases of overcrowding like dysentery and tubercle leave an aftermath .which takes a few years to clear up. Admissions. 18. Criminal lunatics constitute more than half of the total male population. They are increasing steadily. The daily average has risen from 187*98 to 215*37 during the last 9 years. When any vacancy occurred, preference was given to criminal lunatics. Similarly, with non-criminals, such as could be accommodated after providing for criminals, only the most serious and chronic casesa selection of the worst cases detained and under observation in jailscould be taken in and not the mild or acute types which increase the percentage of cures. The net result was that only criminal and dangerous non-criminal cases were admitted, lheir stay is naturally prolonged. The result of such a condition is manifest from the following figures : 1029. 1028. 1927. 1920. 1925. 1924. 1923. 1922. 1921. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Percentage of recoveries to daily average strength, 2-71 365 4-79 3-1Q 3-64 3*70 6-97 14'42 11-49 __ 1020. 11 9'78 19. Patients charged with petty offences mainly attributable to their mental condition are sent to hospital as &quot; criminal &quot; mental patients by the trying magistrates
uring the ad of the i tubercle Such Cases can be dealt with under the provisions of sections 13 to 17 of the Indian Lunacy Act (Act No. XXXII of 1923) as &quot; non-criminal &quot; mental patients and sent to this hospital as such for treatment and safe custody. This would permit of their early discharge on recovery and would obviate the ordeal of a trial. 20. Much unnecessary correspondence is entailed in the office of the Mental Hospital owing to incomplete information being furnished by committing magistrates and police. In some instances, an incomplete history is excusable, e.g., in the case of wandering and homeless persons about whom nothing is known. But the omission of the required section of the law in the committing order is not excusable. Columns 4t and 8 of the descriptive roll are not, as a rule, properly filled in by the police. Water-supply. 21. There is a filtered water-supply from the Tezpur Water-works. The supply is very insufficient though supplemented by a well. The Male Section and the whole staff are suffering acutely from the shortage. The water-supply to the Female Section by extra pumping at night continues ; this arrangement gives an ample supply to that section only. With the appointment of a Sanitary Engineer for the province, it is hoped that p the scheme for provision of an adequate water-supply will rapidly mature. There has been a long correspondence over several years on this question, and the present state of affairs cannot continue. The reconstruction of the Mental Hospital will be completed soon, and the water-supply cannot be left to the municipality any longer. It would be far better for this institution to have a completely independent water&laquo;supply. 22. Lieutenant-Colonel Ritchie has been in charge of the Mental Hospital for many years and is to be much congratulated on his keen interest in the institution. Khan Sahib Sub-Assistant Surgeon Mokhtar Hussain continues to deserve the excellent opinions which have been expressed about him in previous years. The work of Sub-Assistant Surgeon Krishna Kam Das and of the Steward Babu Bepin Behari Sarma has been good. der review e given to its. 1 as games, papers and by- .... Twice, ce.

He accidentally fell causing fracture of lower end of left tibia and owing to the maniacal nature of the patient proper treatment could not be carried out and still the fractured ends are not united. There were a few minor injuries during the year which do not require comment. Finance. 15. {a) Excluding receipts from paying patients and miscellaneous receipts ! _rT;T TTr v which are credited to Government, the total expenditure Statements Nos. VIII, IX and X. ^ ^ up_fceep of the Mental Hospital amounted to Rs. 2,31,669-13-9 against Rs. 2,51,743-14-6 in 1929, The average cost per head was Rs. 477-5-8 against Rs. 572-9-4 in the previous year. The decrease is due to : (i) Decrease in the special expenditure, amounting to Rs. 1,2^,978 for Public Works Department charges for &quot; Original Works&quot; against Rs. 1,50,576 in 1929. (ii) Fall in price of all articles. The total expenditure for the up-keep, therefore, of the Mental Hospital for the year 1930, excluding Rs. 1,22,978 for abnormal Public Works Department original works, amounted to Rs. 1,08,691-1.3*1 against Rs. 1,01,167-14-6 in 1929 or an average cost per head of Rs. 223-15-4 against Rs. 230-1-8 in 1929. Excluding Public Works Department charges, repairs and maintenance charges* rates and taxes, receipts from paying patients and profits on manufactures, the average cost per inmate works out to Rs. 184-4-5 against Rs, 199-3-9 in 1929. The receipts from paying patients were Rs. 697-S-O against Rs. 540-0-0 in 1929. (b) The profits in the manufactory department were Rs. 6,897-12-11 against Rs. 8,270-15-9 or an average of Rs. 104-0-11 per head of inmates employed on manufactures against Rs. 128-5-8. The fall in profit was due to fall in market value of the manufactured goods. The principal item of expenditure was the cost of &quot; Diet&quot; which amounted to &s. 49,070-6-6 against Rs. 46,978-8-0 in 1929. The average cost per head was Rs. 101-1-9 against Rs. 106-13-7 in 1929. The reason for the decrease in average &deg;os,t is explained above. Miscellaneous. 16. (a) Male lunatics are employed on cultivation of vegetables, turmeric, sugar-tjk, . ,, ' cane, iute, manufacture of gtir, repairs of buildings, car- iSmployment of lunatics. 7' J , \, . ... ft, &#9632;' &quot; . . , P.

4 Females are employed on paddy husking, preparation of spices, grinding pulse for cattle food and some sanitary duties. Garden (b) The Mental Hospital garden continues to do well yielding some profit and a useful addition t-&gt; the dietary. The cultivated area of land was increased during the year under report. But it will take some time to bring the whole into the proper standard of fertility. (c) The accommodation available at the end of the year including filthy ward, Accommodation. cells, infirmaries, tubercle wards and better clas&laquo; paying patients' wards was 566 for males and 124 for females or a total of 690 on completion of rebuilding of the Mental Hospital. The accommodation of 690 includes a very old barrack for 24 male patients. This barrack has got many defects and is unsuitable for housing mental patients. It is used for reserve patrol keepers at night. The maximum number confined on any one night during the year under review was 547 against 445 in 1929.

(2) The Commissioner, Assam Valley Division...........................Once. (I) Twelve meetings of visitors were held during the Meetings. year. General Bemarks. 17. There is a marked improvement in the general health of the patients since the completion of reconstruction of the hospital. But it will take some time to clear up the aftermath of diseases like dysentery and tubercle due to previous overcrowding. Admissions. 18.(1) The lunatics awaiting admission in the different jails of the province were all received during the year- Besides these, acute oases were also received. '1 his accounts for the high number of admissions during the year. (2) &quot;With the admission of acute oases, it is hoped to show a higher percentage of recoveries in future. During the last few years, owing to the limited accommodation caused by overcrowding, it was possible to accommodate only the most serious and chronic casesa selection of the worst cases detained in jails. These cases affect the recovery rate adversely. (8) The remarks made in the report of 1929 regarding criminal mental patients charged with petty offences and incomplete documents of new admissions have had no effect. A batch of patients were brought to the hospital gate with no documents whatever, not even a nominal rollonly the usual command certificate of the police escort which was fully armed. Surely the latter was unnecessary.
19. Lieut.-Colonel Ritchie has been in charge of the Mental Hospital for many years. He has run it excellently and takes a very keen interest in the institution. Khan Sahib Sub-Assistant Surgeon Mukhtar Hussain continues to deserve the excellent opinions which have been expressed about him in previous years and thoroughly deserves the praise. The work of Sub-Assistant Surgeon Krishna Ram Das and of the Steward Bepin Bchari Sarma is well reported on. Shillong : i H. L. BATRA, Lieut.-Colonel, I.M.S., Offg.

The average cost per head wad Rs. 213-S-4 against Rs. 477-5-8 in 1930. The decrease is due to (i) Lower expenditure under Public Works Department charges. (U) General fall in the price of food-stuffs. The total expenditure for the up-keep, therefore, of the Mental Hospital for the year 1931, excluding Rs. 2,537-0-0 for abnormal Public Works Department original works, amounted to Rs. 1,17,583-12-9 against Rs. 1,08,691-13-1 in 3 930 or an average cost per head Rs. 209-0-2 against Rs. 223-15-4 in 19o0. Excluding Public Works Department charges, repairs and maintenance charges rates, and taxes, receipts from paying patients and profits on manufactures, the average cost per inmate works out to Rs. 166-10-11 against Rs. 181-4-5 in 1930. The receipts from paying patients amounted to Rs. 1,005-0-0 against Rs. 697-8-0 in 1930.

The fall was due to the lower value of the manufactured goods. The principal item of expenditure was the cost of &quot; Diet &quot; which amounted to Rs. 48,807-10-9 against Rs, 49,070-3-6 in 1030. The average cost per head was Rs. 86-12-1 against Rs. 101-1-9 in 1930. Miscellaneous. 15.

Night-soil is trenched in a selected site on garden land, all infected dejecta being incinerated Conservancy. outside the enclosure. Water supply, {e) Insufficiency of water in the male section and acute shortage in the staff lines continued throughout the year. A tube-well has been sunk near the keepers' new barracks and if it proves a success the insufficiency of water may, to some extent, be mitigated, and enable the barracks to be brought into use. (/) The food is good and sufficient. Extras consisting 00 of milk, dahi, eggs, fruits, etc., are given, as before, to in- mates in poor health.

A leper ward is necessary to accommodate 6 males and 4 females. The buildings necessary should be sited extramurally near the ul ings* tubercle section. 17. With the increase in the population of the hospital the work of the staff has also increased very considerably, so much so that the time 1,1 &raquo; * ua8 come 0 consider an increase in the staff. The most urgent addition is the appointment of a whole-time medical superintendent, as the Civil Surgeon has not the time at his disposal to give to this important institution. It is impossible for him to give that individual attention to patients which is necessary and to carry out the revision of cases systematically. A female head keeper is also necessary to assist the matron in the supervision of the female section. Quarters are available for a head keeper but, so far, the appointment has ramained vacant. In the office an additional hand is required to assist with the ever-increasing correspondence. Lieut.-Colonel W. D. Ritchie, i.m.s , who has been in medical charge of the Mental Hospital for many years, and who is largely responsible for bringing the hospital to its present high standard of efficiency, is shortly retiring and the administration is greatly indebted to him for the able manner in which he has always organised and managed the institution. My acknowledgments are also due to Khan Sahib Dr. Mokhtar Hussain for his continued efficient service.

General remarks. * A regular campaign was carried out, as usual, against hookworm and helminthic infection. Propbylectic measures were also adopted against cholera and dysentery.
5 The question o? appointing a whole-tims Medical Superintendent was seriously considered during the year and Dr. S. N. Ohowdhury o the Assam Medical Service (Senior) was selected for the appointment and sent to the Ranchi Mental Hospital for training. He has since joined duty at Tezpur and taken over charge of the Mental Hospital. This will give much needed relief to the Civil Surgeon, whose services will now only bo available in a consultative capacity. The Superintendent has put forward proposals for additional establishment which will be placed before Government in due course. The Institution is certainly working short-handed and there is pressing need for an additional clerk, an Assistant Matron and mure Head Keepers and Keepers. I am indebted to both Lieutenant-Colonel Ritchie and Lieutenant-Colonel Batra, for the care and interest taken in the management of this Institution during the year ; also to Khan Sahib Dr. Makhtar Hussain, the Deputy Superintendent, for his excellent services.
