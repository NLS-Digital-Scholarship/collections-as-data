ORDER.IP IP/16/HG.4 RESOLUTION ON LOCK-HOSPITAL REPORTS, BRITISH BURMA, For the year 1875. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, British Burma, in the General Department,( 2 ) 4. The cases of disease among European troops as indicated by Dr. Bryden's figures and those given in the review for 1874 materially differ. Adopting the latter as given in Home Secretary's letter No. 448, of 18th November 1875, the following is the result:( 3 ) part the discrepancy; but the only safe deduction from the figures is that the control of prostitution is not efficient. The growing popularity of the hospital may attract larger numbers each year; but it will hardly exhaustively explain an increase from 629 to 855 cases. 6. The registered women were as follow :( 4 ) ments can be made with the Inspector-General for their deputation. At the cantonments, where there are British troops, some such arrangement must be immediately made, if it be considered necessary at all. In Rangoon, par- ticular control over the bazaar between the barracks and the Dhobies' tank, and the bazaar near the cemetery, is needed. The spectacle of public women located so near a road, which is a popular and frequented thoroughfare, is repulsive in the extreme. The same remarks apply to the flagrant exhibitions visible in many of the most public streets of the town. The location of the residence of women who ply this trade demands closer regulation than at present exists. The subject has been separately brought to the notice of the Town Magistrate. 7. The weekly examinations of the women seem to have been beneficial, and should be continued, as occasion arises, at every station where the Act or rules are in force. The two concluding paragraphs of Dr. Fitzgerald's report have the entire concurrence of the Chief Commissioner. The Cantonment Com- mittees of Rangoon, Thayetmyo, and Toungoo should, accordingly, prepare a draft rule to meet the case, and, after consideration, it will be forwarded for the sanc- tion of the Government of India, under sections 17 and 18 of Act XXII. of 1864. For the other stations where Act XIV. of 1868 is in force, Dr. Fitzgerald can prepare the rule for final sanction by this Administration. 8. The character of the disease and the per-centage of the registered women in hospital during the year, are not very encouraging. The buildings used as lock-hospitals are evidently such merely in name. In most, close confine- ment is merely nominal, and the cases of escape cited from Bassein are not very creditable to either the management or the designers of the building. The Chief Commissioner trusts that this, among other matters, will benefit by the diligent supervision which Dr. Fitzgerald has brought to bear upon the Depart- ment, and for which the thanks of the Government are due. Disagreeable as the duty is, it is one of such importance that it cannot be longer neglected. The returns from Prome and Thayetmyo are misleading and incorrect, and in no instance has much care been devoted to the compilation of statistics. 9. The cost of the Rangoon Hospital in March and August, and of the Moulmein Hospital in February, call for explanation. The Government of India considered last year that the fact of no allowance being shown for the Bassein charge was an omission. This has since been corrected. By order of the Chief Commissioner, C. W. STREET, MAJOR, Officiating Secretary.
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LOCK-HOSPITALS OF BRITISH BURMA For the year 1875. From the Deputy Surgeon-General, Indian Medical Department, British Burma Division, to the Officiating Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, British Burma,( 2 ) amended table, but I am unable to reconcile it with his figures. " At one period the actual period regiments remained in garrison was entered; but as different corps arrived at different periods of the year, it was quite impossible to give correct information in one column, so, with the concurrence of your predecessors, it was deemed sufficient to enter merely the number of days in the year; both Artillery and 21st Fusiliers were in the station throughout the year." As will be seen, this explanation neither agrees with the original nor with the amended table. Assuming, however, the correctness of the figures representing the ratio of disease to strength, the increase noted has been accounted for by the Town Magistrate on the assumption that much prostitution takes place which the police are unable to convict. He blames the regimental authorities for not taking more active steps to prevent illicit prostitution within their own lines by camp-followers and low-caste coolie women, and exonerates the police from any remissness in their duty. The Civil Surgeon, while agreeing with the Town Magistrate in his indictment of the regimental authorities, admits that a great deal of prostitution by unregistered women exists in the town itself. Those accusations are entirely without proof, and I believe them to be unjust. I have before me a copy of a letter addressed to the Cantonment Magistrate (who is also the Town Magistrate) under date the 10th May 1875, by the Officer Commanding the 1-21st Fusiliers, requesting him to remove a number of unauthorized persons who had taken up their abode near the European lines. A great increase in the number of admis- sions from venereal disease in the 1-21st Regiment having taken place in July and August, I was requested by the Principal Medical Officer, British Troops, to assist him in devis- ing means for checking the evil. The examination of the registered women every week instead of every fortnight as hitherto was ordered in consequence. The effect of this order will be mentioned further on. Half a company of European infantry was stationed at Bassein for a few months, but there were only three admissions from venereal disease(3) What special measures have been taken for the control of pros- titution, and especially for pre- venting the danger arising from unlicensed prostitutes frequenting the lines. V.( 4 ) example, in statement II., attached to the report from Bassein, it is shown that 12 remained on the register at end of the year 1874, and nine were added in 1875; thus 21 was the maximum number that could have been on the register at any one time in 1875; but, as nine were also removed in the course of the year, it does not follow that it over reached that possible number. Yet from January to December inclusive, the numbers represented as actually on the register range from 22 the lowest, to 26 the highest, and the average monthly number is represented as higher than the possible maximum! Mr. Foster, who merely forwarded the report and returns of his predecessor, has, on being referred to, searched the register and sent me an amended return, which is forwarded with these remarks. I find it impossible to reconcile the report and returns of the lock-hospital at Prome with each other, even after the explanation of the Medical Officer, whose attention was called to the inconsistencies. In statement II. it is said that 20 names were brought on the register during the year, which, added to 25 remaining on the 1st of January 1875, made 45 as the possible maximum. In the report it is explained that the 20 names added to the register were brought on in the following order:( 5 ) still some were reported for non-attendance. The same thing occurred at Akyab and Toungoo. At Prome the attendance was not satisfactory : out of an average strength of 32.3 it appears that 10.2 absented themselves every month, and only 2.5 of them were reported to the Magistrate ; but, as before remarked, the register at Prome was very carelessly kept, and many of the names in it should have been removed long before it was done. At Ran- goon a monthly average of 36.52 absented themselves from the examinations. The Civil Surgeon's explanation of the defective attendance is, that " the majority of them, principally Burmese, absconded, harassed, as they said, by having to attend weekly for examina- tion." I am disposed to account for the choice of the word by which he desires to express the effect produced by the weekly examinations, on the supposition that its exact significance was not clearly present to his mind, or else he would have selected a more appropriate and less objectionable one. To harass' is to worry or annoy for the sake of annoying, and to apply such a term to an order issued solely for the public good merely because it was not agreeable to the public women effected by it, is a muse of language which only serves to show the writer's dislike to a measure which gave him some extra labour, but which he admitted had done much good. The number of absentees from the periodical examinations can be easily ascertained from No. II. statement attached to the report : the Civil Surgeon calculates it at an average of 36.52 a month, but he is silent as to the number of those reported to, the Magistrate, and the column which should have given this information was left blank. On the report reaching me, I pointed out this omission, and requested that it might be supplied. The figures supplied to me are entered in red ink in the proper column, and it will be seen that, while an average number of 36.52 were absent, only an average number of 4.25 were reported to the Magistrate. A more detailed examination of this statement discloses the fact that, from the intro- duction of the weekly examinations on the 23rd of August, while absenteeism increased, the efforts of the Civil Surgeon to restrain it may be said to have practically ceased. Thus, out of a total of 105 absentees in September, only one was reported to the Magistrate ; of sixty- six in October, only one also was reported ; of forty-seven absent in November, not one was reported ; of fifty-four in December, one was reported. A consideration of these facts might suggest to an unprejudiced mind that another cause besides the " now" weekly examinations may have contributed to the increase of absenteeism(6) The arrangements for examin- ing and treating the women of the city and cantonment. IX.( 7 ) tion from Rangoon. As there would be nothing to prevent the women flying also from Yandoon, it would prove rather an expensive mode of persuading them to stay at home, to pursue them with lock-hospitals wherever they went. There is an apparent inconsist- ency also in suggesting the extension of the Contagious Diseases Act to Yandoon (which is not exactly a suburb of Rangoon), and at the same time objecting to the comparatively trifling cost of bringing the outlying villages in the neighbourhood of the station under its operation. It seems to me as reasonable as if a man were to spend a lakh of Rupees in abetting a hypothetical nuisance a hundred miles away while grudging the expense of removing the dung-hill at his door. From the reports of the Medical Officers it appears to me that greater care is required in the keeping of the registers, and that the practice of allowing the names of women who have absconded to remain on them for an indefinite time is to be deprecated. I would recommend the limit of two months, after which any woman who still failed to present herself for periodical examination, except for a sufficient cause( 8 ) Amended Annual Statement No. II. of the Lock-hospital at Bassein for the year 1875. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 NUMBER OF REGISTERED PROSTITUTES.

From the Commissioner of the Arakan Division, to the Officiating Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, British Burma,( 2 ) ment (Sanitary), No. 23-433A., dated 28th October 1875, various items of information were asked for. The greater portion of such information can only be furnished from the Magistrate's Office. As regards the efficiency of the rules in checking disease amongst men, no approach to a satisfactory answer can be given. The Act here applies to a town and to the shipping that frequent the port. There is no regiment stationed here, and it can be only by observing the rise and fall of venereal disease in a compact and stationary body of men, such as a regiment supplies, that satisfactory data could be arrived at. I am quite satisfied, however, that amongst the sailors who come to the port during the rice season, there is very, very much less venereal disease now than there used to be before the establishment of the Lock-hospital. For example, there are, at this present time, fifteen vessels manned with European sailors in port. Perhaps the average number of the crew on board each vessel is some eighteen souls( 3 ) No- I.( 4 ) No. II.( 5 ) No. III.1876. GENERAL DEPARTMENT. (Sanitary.) PROGS. No. 205-1.

In this event, it is to be hoped that a more decent and less conspicuous site may be selected for the accommodation of the prostitutes requiring medical treatment for venereal disease. The number of registered women remains at twenty-five (twenty admissions on the list having taken the place of twenty removals from it). There were forty-five admissions into the Lock-hospital, the admissions for 1874 having been forty-seven. Of six women apprehended and brought before the Magistrate, five were punished by short terms of imprisonment, and one reprimanded. Three unregistered women were apprehended and found to be diseased. The increase in venereal disease in persons of the male sex admitted into the hospital would appear by a casual remark of the Medical Officer to be from forty-five to seventy-five. General Remarks.( 4 ) From the Deputy Commissioner of Bassein, to the Commissioner of the Pegu Division,( 5 ) the corresponding figures for any previous year. The number struck off during the year is higher than usual, but that is due to the large number absconding towards the close of the year. It appears that venereal disease has been more prevalent among the European sol- diers than during the previous year( 6 ) on the salary of the Medical Officer, and Rs. 537-10 on the purchase of clothing and bed- ding, and to the increased dieting. Annual Report on the Lock( 7 ) to report that a great number of the women from whom the soldiers contract disease have not yet been brought under surveillance, unregistered prostitution is very extensively carried out by low caste women residing in squatter villages, and especially in the dhoby lines in the vicinity of the barracks. Many of these, it appears, are married women who prostitute themselves with the consent of their husbands, and who, if called on to register themselves as prostitutes, would at once state and prove that. they are married women. The native police are nearly powerless, as the European soldiers at once resent any interference in matters of this sort. These women, then, and cooly women employed about the barracks, or the women who are constantly passing along the lines of road, selling fruit, cigars, fuel, &c., are believed to be most injurious to the British soldiers. They should be prohibited from visiting the barrack lines after dark, and if, after this order had been publicly proclaimed, any woman transgressed it, there would be nothing wrong in making every woman so found subject to examination and detention in hospital if she were suffer- ing from disease. There is not the slightest doubt that, if greater exertion were taken in this way by the regimental police, there would be a very marked diminution in the number admitted into hospital. Every man admitted into hospital should be compelled, or, if not compelled, he should be induced or coaxed to give up the name of the woman from whom he contracted the disease: during the last year, of the 127 admitted, only five soldiers came forward to point out such prostitutes, and only one of those pointed out was found diseased. There is, though, no doubt that, in Rangoon itself, clandestine prostitution prevails to a very great extent. The mischief, however (as regards Burmese women), is social, and does not depend on police supervision, which, as it is at present organized, cannot reach and destroy it. VI.( 8 ) and requires great patience and perseverance, and, with an establishment of one Inspector of Police, and two or three men under him, the result of the year is most favourable. Prostitutes residing in villages outside the Magistrate's boundary, who are not supposed to be accessible to Europeans and others, are not amenable to the rules. It is essential for the efficient working of the Act that it should be gradually extended, so as to embrace all such. VII.( 9 ) DISEASES. 1872. 1873. 1874. 1875.

I myself do not consider this disease contagious, but others do ; and as venereal was somewhat more preva- lent amongst the men of the regiment in August last, I deemed it advisable to admit them; they were never admitted in previous years. I have no means of comparing the nature of venereal affections among the women, with their nature amongst the soldiers; this would necessitate my attending the regimental hospital. There is not a very great amount of syphilis amongst the prostitutes taken en masse, the greatest amount and the virulent form is in those who carry on illicit prostitution, and who are a good deal frequented by the European soldiery, and they are, I am afraid, to be found in all parts of the town. The admissions during the year were a total of 477, viz., 149 gonorrhæa, 317 syphilis, three secon- dary syphilis, six bubo, and two condyloma. The disease now prevailing among the women admitted is of a less virulent type than it used to be.

The object of the first is to make as much money as she can, by indiscriminate intercourse, regardless of appearances ; and of the second, to avoid open lewdness, but to secure, in a silent manner, sufficient means to lead a life of idleness. It is an easy matter to ensure perfect registration, of the first class, and a very difficult one to obtain any registration of the second. It has been more than once remarked that the registration of prostitutes in Bassein is imperfectly performed, because it bears so small a ratio to the population ; but I would sub- mit that the fixed population does not, and would refuse to support bond fide prostitutes( 15 ) Statement showing the number of persons punished for breaches of the Contagious Diseases Act in the District Court of Bassein during the year 1875.

The defaulters, as a rule, proceed to Shwe-doung, a large and important station, eight miles distant, to evade apprehension. I would again beg to suggest that this town be brought under the Act, as it is reported to be the resort of a large number of private prostitutes. The Deputy Commissioner exercises, in the absence of a Committee, supervision in carrying out the Act. The attendance at the medical examinations has not been so regular as previously. No fees are levied for registration, as the orders of the Government of India prohibit it; and none have been realized by fines in the Courts. During the year, there were forty-five admissions, which, with one remaining from the previous year, makes a total of forty-six : of these, five were unregistered, and the diseases for which they were treated, are given below :(24) No. I.( 25 ) No. II.( 26 ) No.III.( 27 ) Minute by the Deputy Commissioner, Thayetmyo, on the Lock-hospital Report for 1875. THIS report has been written by Dr. Croudace, who has been in charge of the institu- tion since the commencement of the year. The falling-in of the well was noticed last year, and the delay in re-construction does not reflect credit on the Public Works Department here. The ratio of admission per month of the soldiery shows an increase on last year, this is ascribed to the relief in the troops, especially the native corps. The number of cases (seventy-one) treated in the hospital seems small, and nearly tallies with the number of soldiers (sixty-two) admitted for primary venereal diseases. Towards the latter part of the year, the establishment was transferred to the Civil Department: suffi- cient time has not passed to show any improvement in the change. The Assistant Cantonment Magistrate has been active in looking after the working of the rules. The extension of the limits for the Act has been recommended from four to seven miles so as to include the large town of Allanmyo, which is close to Tarangoon, where troops are sometimes quartered, and where there are always a few sepoys. The number of women on the register continues ridiculously small: the facilities for going away to Allanmyo and Prome, and up and down the river by the numerous steamers, has something to do with this, as a woman finds herself at all suspected, away she goes for a short time. A special agency of an inspector, a trustworthy man, to keep a watch on illicit prosti- tution is required. The rule directing the levy of one Rupee for each registered woman, whilst in good health, has been reinforced. "Bamboo Alley" remains in the same site, as a difference of opinion as to desirability in change existed. In the transfer of the establishment to the Civil Department, the saving of one medical subordinate has been made; but the man left in charge of both the institutions (Civil Dispen- sary and Lock-hospital) is totally unfitted for the duties, does not know English, and is wanting in energy. A good Madras dresser, who understands English well, should be appointed, and a slight extra remuneration given him out of the Local Funds. Annual report on the Lock-hospital, Thayetmyo, for the year 1875. The Lock-hospital is situated to the north-east of the town, in close proximity to the Civil Dispensary, from which it is only a few yards distant. It is surrounded by a strong wooden fence; it is separated from the boundary of the cantonment by paddy-fields. The building is of wood, elevated about eight feet above the ground on posts. There is one ward in the centre, which will accommodate twelve patients. It is surrounded by a verandah, nine feet wide on the north and south, and eight feet on the east and west sides. There is a room at the north-west and south corners, each mea- suring fourteen by twelve feet. The former is used for surgery and office-room, and the latter for the examination of the women, in which is a suitable table for the purpose. Below the ward, in the centre is a pucka built bath-room tenfeet by nine. There is a latrine in the come pound built of wood, which is dark; dry-earth is used. Water is brought from the river, the well, which was commenced last year, not being yet completed. Surgeon W. J.

( 28 ) The number of cases of venereal disease treated at the Civil Dispensary during the year is given below :( 29 ) The inspections of the women have been made weekly or every ten days throughout the year, and the attendance of the women was for the most part regular. On some occa- sions a woman has been absent from sickness other than venereal, as fever, &c., in which case she has been visited at her own house by the Native Doctor to verify her statement of the cause of her absence. Those who were absent from other causes, or had left the station, were reported to the Cantonment Magistrate. Number absent during the year was twenty-eight. The examinations are conducted in the examination-room : they are called in one by one, and examined in presence of myself, Native Doctor, and matron. There being a Bur- mese woman, they have less objection than they otherwise might be expected to have, and in the case of newly-registered women, her presence gives them more confidence, and they more readily submit to examination. A table is given below, showing the number of admis- sions for the year compared with last year. 1874. 1875. Number of admissions 45 69 A Burman matron is attached to the hospital, and maintains order and cleanliness ; she performs her duties efficiently. " Bamboo Alley," the street in which the registered women live, is situated at a considerable distance from the cantonment, so that those men going there have to pass through a large portion of the town, and probably, in doing so, meet with other women, who carry on illicit prostitution, and contract disease from them. The obligation on all licensed women to reside in this locality probably prevents many women from registering who might otherwise do so. In the annual return of the hospital the number absconded is shown as twenty-one. Of this number several were entered more than once, having returned and deserted again. Thus six deserted once, and returned ; six deserted twice, and returned ; and nine deserted, and not returned( 30 ) Abstract of the preceding return. IN-PATIENTS.

No registration fees have been levied since June 1870, when the monthly payment of one rupee from each woman was discontinued. 8. The women have been, with few exceptions, regular in attendance at the weekly examinations. On some occasions women have been absent on account of sickness other than venereal, as fever, &c., and these have been visited at their own houses by the Native Doctor to verify their statement of the cause of absence. Those absent from other causes, or who left the station, were reported to the Cantonment Magistrate. The women fre- quently leave the station for a time, and return again ; they are in the habit of going down to the river-ghaut on arrival of steamers, and go to Prome or to Upper Burma. Six women deserted once, and returned ; six deserted twice, and returned again ; and nine deserted, who did not return. The fines levied for desertion amounted to Rs. 14. 9. Women in the City or Cantonment who are unregistered, are, when detected practising prostitution illicitly, sent to the hospital for examination, and, if found to be diseased, are detained under treatment until well. 10. The number of women treated during the year was seventy, being an increase of eighteen over the previous year. These women, it is believed, frequently contract disease from men who come from Upper Burma on the river steamers. No cases have been of a virulent character. Of the seventy cases treated during the year, twelve were due to non- venereal affection, viz., six for ulcer of Os Uteri, and six for ordinary ulcers. 11. There is one Burman matron, or nurse, attached to hospital, who looks after the women, and applies local applications, &c. 12. None.

The inmates of both the institutions are reported to have behaved themselves well. There were sixty-eight prostitutes at Moulmein on the register at the close of the year against eighty-five at the close of the preceding year, and sixteen at Toungoo against eleven at the close of the preceding year. 15. The expenditure including establishment of the Moulmein lock-hos- pital during the year of report amounted to Rs. 2,036-11-6, against Rs. 2,073-5-8 in the previous year, showing a decrease in favour of the year of report. 16. The entire expenditure is contributed by Government. The receipts from fines as above reported amounted to Rs. 35 against Rs. 495 in the previous year. 17. The expenditure of the Toungoo lock-hospital during the year of report was Rs. 1,415-15-4 against Rs. 661-7-7 in the previous year. The institu- tion was opened in June 1874, and necessarily shows a less expenditure in the previous year. The receipts from fines amounted to Rs. 8. Annual Report of the Lock-hospital, Toungoo, for 1875. THE TOUNGOO Lock-hospital was opened in June 1874. As there was at the time no suitable place, a temporary bamboo-hut was erected for its accommodation near the jail. In March 1875 the hospital was removed to the old dispensary building, situated quite at the western limit of the civil station. The site is free and open, and the best available. There is accommodation for twelve natives in the main ward, besides which, there is a writ- ing-room, an examination-room, surgery, and store-room. The out-offices consist of a good cook-room, a bath-room, and a latrine. The compound is railed all round, but which does not prevent any of the inmates leaving the place, if they choose to do so. The main ward measures forty feet by twenty feet, giving each a superficial area of sixty feet. The building is raised about seven feet from the ground. Ventilation is maintained by opposite doors and windows, and openings in the side walls under the eaves, and at the ridge. The hospital being situated on a low piece of ground, the drainage around is not good, but as yet there has been no injurious effect on the health of the inmates from it. The hospital accommodation is quite sufficient for the number of women on the register. 2. Owing to the relief of the Native Regiment, there has been several changes in the medical charge of the Lock-hospital during the past year. Surgeon Leapingwell relieved Surgeon-Major Giraud in March last, and I relieved the former in July last. 3. During the past year there has been a marked decrease of venereal disease amongst the European troops at this station. Out of an average strength of 476.41 Europeans, there has been only twenty-nine admissions from venereal disease, viz., primary syphilis, eight ; gonorrh( 3 ) very great extent. In this place the soldiers are not in the habit of frequenting the houses of the women, but of meeting them in fields and unfrequented places, and consequently, when any of them contracted disease, they were unable to point out the person from whom they did so. 6. There were eleven prostitutes on the register on the 1st of January 1875: ten new women were registered during the year. Out of this number, five have withdrawn their names on leaving the station; the remaining sixteen were on the register on the 1st of January 1876( 4 ) No. I.( 3 ) No. II.( 6 ) No. 111( 7 ) From the Assistant Cantonment Magistrate, Toungoo, to the District Magistrate, Toungoo,( 8 ) the present arrangement, the services of one subordinate is divided between the General and Lock-hospitals, and must be available also for the Leper-hospital. 2. Surgeon-Major W. F. deFabeck, M.D., was in medical charge during the whole year, excepting a few days in March, while absent on duty at Rangoon, when Dr. Sinclair, Superintendent of the Moulmein Jail, officiated. 3. There were no European troops stationed in Moulmein during the past year. The cantonment is garrisoned by a wing of the 15th Regiment, Madras Native Infantry. The Medical Officer in charge of the Regiment has furnished a statement in the prescribed form, showing the extent to which venereal diseases have occurred amongst the sepoys. The information thus furnished is embodied in the following statement:( 9 ) 9. All prostitutes are, after registration, examined at the hospital, and detained for treatment, if found diseased.

The numbers on the register at some of the hospitals are so small that there cannot be a doubt that registration is by no means perfect, and that there must be many women unlicensed at every station. The protected area remains the same, except at Thayetmyo, where it has been increased to no less than 196 square miles. The working of the Acts over so large an extent of ground must be merely nominal. VII.-Whether registration fees have been levied, and at what rate. Registration fees are only exacted at Rangoon and Thayetmyo, at 1 Re. each woman per mensem. This fee should be exacted at all stations. In addition, a small sum has been realised by fines. The amount realised was as follows:- Fees. Fines. Total. Rangoon .. .. Rs.3,645 Rs.824 .. Rs.4,469 Thayetmyo .. .. " 219 .. " 205 .. " 424 Moulmein .. .. .. " 130 .. " 130 Total Rs.5,023. The remarks of the Medical Officer of the Rangoon Lock Hospital, in his report, are unintelligible, and his figures erroneóus. He says the total expenditure was Rs. 14,958-10-2, while the cost to the State was Rs. 16,811-10-2. All this officer's figures require to be received with the closest scrutiny. VIII.( 4 ) It will be observed that the attendance has not been nearly so good as it was in 1876. The Medical Officer at Toungoo has failed to give any information on this point for 1877. Excluding this station, the average attendance in 1876 was 88.83 per cent., against 71 per cent. in 1877, which is a great falling-off. Rangoon and Bassein are chiefly accountable for this defection. The numbers on the register at Bassein, however, are so small that they do not effect the general total number. At Rangoon, the falling-off in the number attending the examination is not accounted for by the Medical Officer; but the Town Magistrate, I notice, attributes it to the weekly examination ordered by me in May last. These weekly examinations were ordered in consequence of the Medical Officer reporting to me that disease was much more prevalent amongst the women than usual, and this was proved to be the case by the very large number of women found diseased and admitted into hospital. The Town Magistrate considers the weekly examination causes discontent and that the oftener they are held, the greater will be the difficulty in forcing registrations; but surely it is de- sirable that a woman should only be allowed to go about spreading disease broadcast for a week, than a fortnight, even at the risk of causing her some discontent. If her trade renders her amenable to the law, it is the duty of the Magistrate to enforce that law, and protect the public. These weekly examinations were discontinued by my orders, after August, when it was reported to me that the number and severity of the cases had considerably decreased; but I shall not hesitate to order them to be resumed if I see necessity for doing so. Weekly examinations are held at all the hospitals throughout the year, except at Bas- sein, Moulmein, and Rangoon; and it is at these very stations where the attendance is worst. No complaints are made, at the stations where weekly examinations are held, of discontent among the prostitutes, or of any inconvenience; and I am of opinion every registered prostitute should be examined at least once a week. In all, 2,240 cases were reported to the Magistrates for non-attendance at the periodical examinations. Of this number, no less than 2,037 were at Rangoon, according to the Medical Officer's report; but he does not shew how many were punished. This officer's figures, however, are not very reliable as before stated, and it is difficult at times to comprehend his meaning. It will be observed, he states in paragraph 7 of his report that 758 were found diseased, out of 8,171 examined; in the next para. he gives the total admissions into hospital at 950.

From the Commissioner of the Pegu Division to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, British Burma, ( 2 ) The attendance at Rangoon appears to have been extremely bad. With an aver- age of 443 women on the list, there has been an average attendance of only 286. The number of women reported to the Magistrate for non-attendance is stated to have been 2,037 during the last year; but of this number, only 201 appear to have been brought before the Magistrate for. punishment. In the Thayetmyo Hospital, the attendance appears to have been extremely regular. 6. The numbers found diseased at the periodical examination, and detained in hospital, during the two years were as follow :- 1876. 1877. Rangoon ... ... ... ... ... ... 519 758 Thayetmyo ... ... ... ... ... ... 62 47 Prome ... ... ... ... ... ... 45 37 Bassein ... ... ... ... ... ... 31 23 Henzada ... ... ... ... ... ... 6 15 There has been a very large increase in the number found diseased at Rangoon. The consequence has been that the lock hospital building is greatly overcrowded. It contains accommodation for 71 patients only, whilst there have been as many as 169 in it at one time; and the daily average for the year has been 103. 7. The number of patients treated for venereal disease at the Military, General, and Jail Hospitals of the places where lock hospitals are established during the last two years were, so far as can be gathered from the reports, as follow:- Military. General and Jail. Total. 1876. 1877. 1876. 1877. 1876. 1877. Rangoon ... ... 116 167 ... ... ... ... ... ...

I have delayed the report in order to obtain more information from the Civil Surgeon, Rangoon, on this point, which is the most important point of all in connection with the lock hospital system, but have not received a reply. The amount of venereal disease amoung the European troops in Rangoon appears to have been greater in 1877 than in any of the pre- vious seven years. In Thayetmyo, it will be seen, there was a most satisfactory decrease of disease, both among the European military and civil population. The number of cases amongst the native soldiery does not appear to be noted. Of the 64 cases amongst the European troops in 1877, the Civil Surgeon states that no less than 28 cases were imported by the troops themselves, so that the locally acquired cases numbered only 36. Considering the large size of Rangoon town, the staff employed in the detection of unlicensed prostitution appears to be insuffi- cient. It consists only of an inspector and two constables; and the Inspector moreover is court prosecutor in the Court of the Assistant Magistrate, so that he can really have very little time to devote to his duties in connection with the lock hospital. The number of persons reported in 1877 for unlicensed prostitution in Rangoon was only 50; whilst in Thayetmyo, with its much smaller population, there were 30 punished by the Magistrate for this offence. But, whilst in Rangoon the women so brought up appear to have been subsequently placed on the register of prostitutes, none of those punished in Thayetmyo were enrolled. 8. The receipts of each hospital from registration fees and fines during the last two years were- 1876. 1877. Rangoon ... ... ... ... ... Rs. 5,573 Rs. 4,469 Thayetmyo ... ... ... ... ... ...

( 3 ) From the Town Magistrate, Rangoon, to the Commissioner of the Pegu Division,( 4 ) There are three wards for Natives, having accommodation for 66 beds only, and one for Europeans to hold five beds. The average during the year has been 103.91 natives, and during the months of May, June, July, and August was 133. The largest number of patients at one time in hospital was 169 on the 22nd June, and the smallest number 51 on the 13th March, so that it will be seen the accommodation is quite sufficient to the requirements.

Although the difference is not so marked when compared with the average of last five years, still I cannot think that registration has been sufficiently carried out during the year,( 7 ) IX.( 8 ) Statement shewing the daily average of Sick treated in the Lock Hospital, Rangoon, during the past five years.

( 9 ) Beyond the fact that venereal was prevalent during the months named, I know of no reason to account for the large increase in the number of admissions, unless indeed it be due to the different views Medical Officers hold as to what is likely to prove infectious or not. XI.( 10 ) No. I.( 11 ) No. II.( 12 ) No. III.( 13 ) Annual Report on the Lock Hospital at Thayetmyo for 1877. DR. OSWALD BAKER, who took over medical charge of the civil station in October 1877, submits the report of this lock hospital for the past year, and has taken such pains over it, and gone so fully into the subject, that few remarks remain to be made. 2. The cook-house should be supplied as soon as possible, and so render the institu- tion perfect in all respects. The D. P. W. will be addressed on the matter. 3. Dr. Baker's remarks as to the importation of the disease with the incoming of new troops is nothing new. When the reliefs consist of a large body of men, the importation of the disease is more apparent by tabulated statements; but it is equally true throughout the year, as it continues with every draft of men which arrive. 4. The segregation of the public women can be legally effected under the rules; but during the past two or three years there has existed a difference of opinion, chiefly amongst the medical men, as to the real benefit to be obtained thereby. There is plenty of available space for additional houses in the existing locality. 5. The artillery horse-keepers' line, and the rudder bazaar, where the camp-follow- ers reside and live with their so-called wives, are most productive of illicit prostitution; and the police are quite at fault, and find the greatest difficulty in detecting the same, especially amongst the Madrassee grass-cuts. 6. Lieutenant-Colonel Hand, commanding H. M.'s 44th Regiment, informs me that when at Secunderabad he got two native policemen, and associated them with his provost sergeant and military Police, for the detection of prostitutes and prevention of dram-selling, and was most successful. The men were made chums of, and, where the European could not go without instantly being noticed, the native slipped in, and the European came up to his assistance when required. I recommend a similar plan here, and that two selected police- men be placed as an experiment under the orders of Colonel Hand for the purposes of detection of illicit prostitution and sale of liquor in connection with his military police. 7. In paragraph VI. of his report, Dr. Baker has some interesting remarks with refer- ence to the number of registered prostitutes and extent of the disease in comparison with the population, &c., of the prescribed area; and Dr. Baker is right in his conjecture. As a rule, the Burman does not go with the public prostitute, but finds what he wants in a somewhat similar fashion to that in vogue amongst the lower orders of the Welsh. The argument set up, however, somewhat spoils and refutes the deduction drawn from the pretty table in paragraph 10 of the report, " comparing the relative prevalence of venereal disease among the troops in garrison, civil paupers and criminal population, and registered prostitutes." 8. The prescribed area was increased, so as to take in Taragoon, where military are stationed now and then, and which is in the immediate vicinity of Allanmyo and Yuatoung. This increased area must be productive of benefit whenever troops are sent across the river. 9. The decrease in the disease amongst the registered women is evidently the satis- factory result of the improved regularity in attendance for periodical examination. 10. The fees collected from the prostitutes during 1877 came to Rs. 219,( 14 ) by surrounding roomy verandah and two smaller apartments which are projected forward from the two front angles of the building. One of these two rooms is used for the examin- ation of prostitutes, and the other for compounding medicines. The hospital, which is raised on pingado posts eight feet above the ground, stands in a small compound in the rear of the charitable dispensary,( 15 ) The daily average strength of the European garrison for the past year, as nearly as it can be calculated from the returns received, was,( 16 ) prostitutes' quarter. And this being the case, it is clearly apparent that no unlicensed prosti- tution can go on in this particular locality, for, in the event of any unregistered girl practising there, she would not only stand an imminent risk of immediate detection and punishment, but her presence would speedily irritate the registered girls, and they would quickly procure her expulsion. That registered prostitutes should be compelled to live in a settled and fixed abode is a rule which, I think, conduces in an excellent way to diminish the prevalence of venereal disease, for, although it does not necessarily reduce the number of unregistered prostitutes, it certainly absolutely shuts them out from that particular locality ; and, as I have endeavoured to shew elsewhere, if men bent on sexual intercourse would visit only the prostitutes' quarter, the Contagious Diseases Act then would yield as satisfactory results in Burma as it does in other countries. This compulsory residence is the effect of legal enactment, and it is a measure most beneficial to the community, and would probably promote the advantages of the Act wherever introduced. No special means for the suppression of unlicensed prostitution have been taken during the past year. The Officers in medical charge of the soldiers have been active in ascertaining from the men who have acquired disease whence they contracted it, and in three instances were successful in bringing before the authorities unregistered women who, on examination, were found to be suffering. The accompanying statement furnished by the Cantonment Magistrate shews that the police have not been idle in their duty of controlling illicit intercourse.

( 17 ) I must not omit to mention that a constable has been appointed to see if any women are absent from the periodical examinations, and to keep those who attend in order. It has occurred twice this year that a prostitute, found diseased and told to remain for treatment, has found opportunity to run away at once while the officers of the institution were occupied with the examination.

This latter statement shews the numbers on the register and the numbers attending the periodical examinations as iden- tical, while in the next and adjacent column it demonstrates that 11 registered women were reported to the Magistrate for non-attendance.

There has been a change of matrons. The one formerly employed was dismissed for conniving at the absconding from hospital of two women under treatment. One was apprehended and punished : the other has not been heard of. The total expenditure during the year, for all purposes, amounted to Rs. 904-3-1, against Rs. 765-0-9 of the previous year. The entertainment of a cook was necessitated in Septem- ber, owing to the admission of patients into hospital. All the charges incurred were paid from provincial funds.

From the Commissioner of the Tenasserim Division to the Deputy Surgeon-General, Indian Medical Department, British Burma Division (despatched through the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, British Burma),No. 551-68, dated the 22nd March 1878. I HAVE the honour to forward the report on the lock hospitals at Toungoo and Moulmein for the year 1877. 2. At both places, the buildings used for these institutions are considered unsuited, more particularly at Toungoo, where, from the inconvenient locality on which it is built, efficient supervision and control cannot be exercised ; the build- ing, also, is said to be old and badly protected, the palisade being so low as to admit of escapes over it by the inmates of the hospital. A reference will be made to the Deputy Commissioner on this subject. 3. The result at both stations during the year of admissions from venereal affections (though shewing a decrease at Toungoo) are not satisfactory. Admissions. Moulmein 1876 ... 214. 1877 ... 292. Toungoo 1876 ... 73. 1877 ... 45. The Medical Officer at Toungoo, in remarking on this subject, adds that "allowance must be made for a frontier station like Toungoo, which is open to in fection on all sides : Shans, Karens, and people from Upper Burma, and also from the south, daily come into Toungoo, and the disease is imported by them." Shwe gyeen, where there is a detachment of the 17th Regiment, N. I., and Ningyan, a large town a short distance beyond the frontier, are, he adds, " two well-known sources of venereal disease." Much of the disease contracted by the troops at Toungoo is supposed to be from the native camp-followers and native residents of the bazaar at that station, who, it is alleged, practise prostitution clandestinely. With regard to the removal of this evil, it has already been remarked by the Gov ernment of India in its resolution on the lock hospital report for 1876, that much depends upon regimental arrangements and control. The expenditure incurred during the year amounted to Rs. 782-15-9. 4. At Moulmein, among the troops, which consisted of a wing of the 4th and a wing of the 15th Regiment, M. N. I., the number of cases of venereal affections increased slightly during the year of report. The increase was confined to the latter regiment, which had been located at the station a longer period. The Police Inspector attached to the civil lock hospital at Moulmein supervises and regis ters all prostitutes. Among the civil population the admissions increased, being as follows for the past four years : 1874.( 2 ) 7. At Toungoo, I have already noted that the situation is an undesirable one from its being so far removed from the civil hospital, but in this opinion, however, Mr. Rivers Thompson differed from me. There is no doubt, however, but that inconvenience must be, and is; felt. Report on the Lock Hospital, Moulmein, for the year 1877. SINCE last year, no alteration has been made in the lock hospital or out-buildings. Repairs as needful have been carried out, but the new building is greatly needed to supersede the temporary hospital. The accommodation provided by the hospital has been annually reported, and it has not been necessary to increase or alter it. The average daily sick has been 4·78 during the year. The average space per inmate was 3,923 cubic feet. Repairs are carried out as required on representation made to the Department Public Works. All the buildings and the enclosures are kept in a cleanly state. The site is naturally well drained. Water is obtained from a good well close by, which also supplies the general hospital all the year round. 2. There was no change in the medical charge of the lock hospital during the year. 3. A wing of the 4th and a wing of the 15th Regiments, M. N. I., have been stationed in Moulmein during the year. Returns in the usual form, exhibiting the extent of venereal disease in the respective corps, have been furnished by the officers in medical charge. Regiments. Period of occupation.

Women who failed to attend the periodical examinations more than three times, if not found residing in the station, are struck off the hospital list. 9. Women on being registered are sent to the lock hospital for examination, and detained for treatment if found diseased. No prostitutes are permitted to reside in cantonment. 10.

A fresh batch of these women (camp-followers) arrive in the station with each relief of European troops. There is no doubt that the British troops consort with some of these women, but it is extremely difficult to prove the fact, there being no European inspector of police to watch the movements of the suspected ones. 6. When I assumed charge of this hospital in March 1877, there were 15 women on the register ; at the present time there are 22 on the register. They present themselves every Friday morning for examination, and are personally inspected by the Surgeon in charge of the hospital. 7. During the year 27 women were reported to the Cantonment Magistrate for non- attendance at the weekly examination, and punished accordingly by fine or imprisonment. I think the former mode of punishment is felt more by these women than imprisonment. They do not seem to care in the least about going to jail for 10 days. No fees are exacted from the prostitutes. When under treatment in hospital, they receive a daily allowance of two annas, with which they provide food for themselves. 8. There are four servants,( 10 ) Expenditure during the year 1877.

1 8 7 8. GENERAL DEPARTMENT. PROGS. No. 287-3. Annual Return of Lock Hospitals for the year 187 From Commissioner of Tenasserim,RESOLUTION ON THE REPORT ON LOCK-HOSPITALS IN BRITISH BURMA For the year 1877. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, British Burma, in the General Department,( 2 ) there has been a more than commensurate increase of disease, both among the women themselves and among the European soldiers and the examinations, which are the most essential portion of the system, have been less stringently carried out than in former years. 3. The falling-off in all these respects has occurred chiefly in Rangoon, where the numbers dealt with far exceed those at any other station. Of the total of 1,100 registered, 705 belong to Rangoon ; and among these there were 950 cases of sickness, while the average attendance at the periodical examinations was about 65 per cent., or less than at any other hospital. The causes of this are explained in the report. In the first place, it is pretty clear that the executive staff, whose duty it is to carry out the law, is quite inadequate for the work. In a town of upwards of a hundred thousand inhabitants, it is impossible for a single Inspector of Police, who is engaged in court more than half the day, and has only two or three peons to assist him, to exercise any check over illicit pros- titution. And according to the report of the Medical Officer, the medical establish- ment is also insufficient. In the second place, it is alleged that most of the dis- ease is beyond the control of the local authorities, being imported mainly by coolie immigrants from the Madras coast. Besides this, however, there are not wanting in the report indications of a lack of that strict supervision and control which is imperatively required if the present rules are to be of any value. If the medical and police establishments have been too weak for the efficient performance of their duties, it is matter for regret that this has not been brought prominently to notice earlier, and the defect supplied. No time should now be lost in introducing the necessary reform. The second allegation is of such a nature that it would tend to paralyse the efforts of the police and other preventive agencies, and without strong evidence any such assertion cannot be accepted. On the face of the matter, there is no apparent reason for thinking that venereal disease is more prevalent in the seaport towns of Madras than in those of Burma, and at any rate it is difficult to believe that so much disease is imported as to affect the returns very seriously. If this is so, there should not be much difficulty in obtaining proof of the fact, and it might then be possible to devise some special measure to meet the evil. Informa- tion might be obtained and recorded in the Lock-hospital books as to the places in which disease was contracted, the dates when the women left Madras, and other details ; and special vigilance should be exercised in regard to new arrivals. The state of things described by the Assistant Magistrate should be at once remedied. Cordial co-operation between the medical, police, and magisterial authorities is required, and it must be borne in mind that, under section 2 of the rules, the Magistrate invested with power to try breaches of them is the officer who is "responsible for the actual execution of the rules." It is asserted by the Magis- trate(3) Arakanese only eight cases of clandestine prostitution were detected and that there were no Arakanese women on the register at the end of the year. At Thayetmyo, both civil and medical authorities appear to have exerted themselves to carry out the rules efficiently, with such success that only 60 per mile of the garrison con- tracted venereal disease in the station. The proportion of registered prostitutes to the general population is really much greater than is shewn in the report. Prac- tically, the area protected is that of the town with a population of 10,427, which, with an average of 24.9 prostitutes registered, gives a proportion of one in. 418. The large amount of disease among the men of the Artillery compared with the Infantry is still remarkable. It points, as suggested by the Deputy Commissioner, to the probability of illicit prostitution among the Native camp- followers, and to the need of greater watchfulness on the part of the military author- ities. The Deputy Commissioner mentions a plan adopted by Lieutenant-Colonel Hand at SecunderabadIP/16/HG.4 REPORT ON LOCK-HOSPITALS, BRITISH BURMA, For the year 1878.
RESOLUTION ON THE REPORT ON LOCK-HOSPITALS IN BRITISH BURMA For the year 1878. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of British Burma in the General Department,( 2 ) Surgeon-General has been already requested to draw up a few simple rules for the guidance of Medical Officers in preparing their statistics; and it is to be hoped that a greater degree of accuracy and uniformity in future reports will result. 3. The statistics of the Rangoon Lock-hospital shew that the average num- ber of women on the register during 1878 was 472, as compared with an average of 443 in 1877. Of the women not in hospital, an average of 85.5 per cent. attended examination, of whom seven per cent. were, on an average, found to be diseased at each examination. The total number of women reported as absent from examina- tion is said to have been 1,862, but this number evidently includes, as separate cases, successive absences of the same women, some of whom proved ultimately to have died or gone away from. Rangoon. Only 103 women were arrested and brought before the Magistrate for non-attendance ; 89 were convicted and punished, and 14 were discharged. The number of arrests should apparently have borne a larger percentage to the number of absentees. The statistics of venereal disease among the troops in Rangoon are untrustworthy ; but it is believed that there was a diminution both in the number and in the virulence of the cases. No parti- culars have been given by the Civil Surgeon of the number of cases of venereal disease treated at the General Hospital in the course of the year, but as he points out, the number of patients treated in hospital affords no criterion of the amount of disease prevalent among the populace, for natives, both of India and of Burma, generally prefer their own remedies and only come to hospital as a last resource. The Civil Surgeon attributes the propagation of the disease in great measure to unregistered women ; and the fact that, of the 280 women who were brought on the register, nearly all were found to be diseased to some extent bears out his opinion. Thirty-six women were arrested in the course of the year for practising clandestine prostitution, of whom 21 were fined and 15 discharged. Proposals were under consideration during the year with a view to the more efficient work- ing of the Act in Rangoon ; and sanction has since been given to an increase to the Lock-hospital Police, and to the entertainment of an Apothecary for the lock- hospital. The Commissioner has proposed that the limits within which the rules operate should be extended ; and he has been asked to specify the limits which he would recommend. 4. At Akyab the average number of women on the register was 69.5, and 92 per cent. attended on an average the periodical examinations. Forty-nine women were reported for non-attendance, and 151 women were found to be diseased. The average number of women in hospital was 9.68. This hospital is said to have been neglected during the latter part of the year by the officer in charge, and his report is a very meagre and unsatisfactory document. An enquiry was instituted into the matter, but, owing to the death of the officer con- cerned, it was not considered necessary to continue it. The delay in the sub- mission of the Akyab report has been the main cause of the lateness of the general report for the province. At Moulmein, the average number of women on the register was 52.2, and the average number attending examination 50.4. Eighteen women were reported to the Magistrate for non-attendance; but the number punished is not stated. A sum of Rs. 10 is said to have been realized from fines ; but the amount is not entered in the statement attached to the report. Seventy- four women were found to be diseased, the diseases being mostly of a mild type. The percentage of disease among the women appears to have steadily decreased during the past five years. The actual number of prostitutes in Moulmein is admittedly far in excess of the number on the register ; but no explanation of the incomplete registration is given, nor are any suggestions made for a more efficient working of the Act. The attention of the authorities will be drawn to the necessity of devising some remedy for this state of things. Only two cases of venereal disease occurred during the year among the native troops stationed at Moulmein. Of the civil population 295 were admitted to hospital for venereal complaints, as compared with 292 admissions in 1877. At Thayetmyo, the average number of women on the register was 24.83 and the percentage of attendance among them was 80. Thirty-two women were reported for non- attendance ; but it is not stated in how many bases punishments were inflicted, Fifty-nine women in all were found to be diseased, and the average number in
( 3 ) hospital was 5.6. The returns of the European troops, if correct, show a very satisfactory improvement on the figures of the previous year. Fines were levied under the Act to the amount of Rs. 270, but the particulars of the cases are not given. Ten women suffered fine or imprisonment for carrying on illicit prostitu- tion. At Toungoo, there were on an average thirteen women on the register. The actual number of women practising prostitution in Toungoo must of course have been far greater than this. The attendance of the registered women at examina- tion (84 per cent.) was good. Fourteen women were reported for non-attendance, and in five cases punishment to the extent of eight days' imprisonment (the maximum allowed by the Act) was inflicted. There was comparatively little sickness among the women. The statistics of the European troops at this station, as given by the Civil Surgeon, differ very materially from those given by the Deputy Surgeon-General ; but from either, it would appear that the ratio of venereal complaints per mille of the average strength exceeded that of the previous year. From a comparison of the statistics of the disease among the troops and among the registered women it is evident that the men must have con- tracted it in many cases, and especially in the last four months of the year, from unregistered women. Every effort should be made to bring these women under surveillance. The native troops at Toungoo were remarkably free from venereal disease. Out of an average strengh of 800 men, there were only two admissions during the year. There is nothing in the report of the remaining lock-hospitals of Prome, Bassein and Henzada, which calls for special remark. 5. The officer responsible for the management of the lock-hospitals through- out the year was Dr. Oswald, Deputy Surgeon-General. Dr. Oswald visited every hospital, except Akyab, and found them all in fair order. He was unfortunately transferred from this province before the annual review was written. His successor, Dr. Joseph, being new to the province, has been under a disadvantage in writing his review. From Dr. Joseph's twelfth paragraph it appears that he adopts Dr. Oswald's suggestion for the employment of a special detective police force on lock- hospital duties. The Chief Commissioner's views on the subject of this sugges- tion were submitted to the Government of India on the 10th April 1878.

BROWNE, Commissioner of Pegu, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, British Burma,( 2 ) appears to have been 113.5. This accounts for 417 out of the total of 463, leaving the total average of absentees only 11 per cent. ; and of these, a large proportion may have been absent from unavoidable causes. The number of cases of wilful neglect to attend when the women ought to have attended and were able to attend is uncertain. Out of the 1,865 cases of non-attendance reported to the Magistrate, many of the women may have been dead, have left the station, or have been pre- vented by illness from attending. The number, the Civil Surgeon states, includes " those who were reported at each successive examination as absent, until their names were struck off, viz. a period of two months." In case of a woman dying, therefore, her name would be returned eight times as that of an absentee. The Magistrate refers to certain orders issued by the Deputy Surgeon-General, Dr. Duff, some years ago, on this subject, and states that these orders do not appear to have been attended to. On perusing the Deputy Surgeon-General's letter No. 1026-73, dated 22nd August 1873, however, I think it may be doubted whether an adherence to these orders would have improved matters much. The Deputy Surgeon-General states :( 3 ) A set of rules, prescribing a rational way of keeping registers and making out returns, would seem to be desirable. It is also recommended that a European or East Indian medical assistant should replace the native assistant who is resident at the hospital. The Ma- gistrate states :( 4 ) And the expenditure on each hospital was :( 5 ) ANNUAL REPORT ON THE RANGOON LOCK-HOSPITAL FOR THE YEAR 1878. I.( 6 ) On only two occasions in the last seven years have there been so few admissions. Under head of secondary syphilis the decrease is especially marked, there being only four admissions this year, against 46 last year: this would seem to point to a mild infection of the poison in its primary form, or else to increased physical stamina on the part of the men of the 89th Regiment, compared with the 21st which was quartered here last year, rendering subsequent constitutional effects less likely to occur amongst those infected. Under primary syphilis there has also been a marked dimunution,( 7 ) ing unlicensed prostitution, with the punish ment given by the Magistrates. In each case an order was made to have them registered:( 8 ) From the above, it will be seen that registration has been carried on effectually during the year; and it is evident that it cannot have been without effect, when it is considered what a large number of women have been prevented from carrying on their trade by being admitted to hospital when diseased, and who would otherwise have spread disease in all directions. Of the registered women, I have estimated that at least two-thirds of them have suffered from secondary syphilis at some period of their existence; and I believe about one-half of these have been so affected as to be never safe,( 9 ) taken before the Magistrate, out of whom only 14 were discharged, the rest receiving various punishments according to statement given below :( 10 ) X.( 11 ) I would point out further that the fixed establishment is also much below that of other 1st class lock-hospitals. Below are those of Madras and Rangoon compared : it will be seen that, although the last-mentioned hospital is the larger of the two, it has not an establishment equal to that of the former.

The following table gives particulars for each month :( 18 ) V.( 19 ) There appears, therefore, to have been some slight connection, notably in December, between the amount of admissions from these causes amongst the (possible) infecters and the infected.

These remarks of course have an equal application to preceding years as to the past year, and I am not making any attempt to disguise the increase in venereal disease which is now being registered at the dispensary. I wish to be understood, however, in that I think the causes just noted may have affected the returns in a large degree ; and also that on other grounds, connected with recent methods of registration, the dispensary returns, as data for comparison, are misleading. In the case of the criminal population however, the figures given are deserving of more attention. They have not been subject, in the first place, to any changed form of record, and are absolutely free from errors ; and in the next, as they relate only to criminals in- carcerated without distinction in one common jail, who, when diseased, have not the choice of concealment, it is manifest that in the consideration of the prevalence of venereal maladies, they furnish a very reliable field for observation and deduction. It is indeed a very remarkable circumstance that such a decided diminution of venereal disease should have taken place among the criminal classes without a commensurate reduction elsewhere, and one for which I fail to find any satisfactory or plausible explanation. It has been often asserted, and seems now to be generally recognized, that the natives of Burma do not largely support a public system of open prostitution ; that such of them as patronize com- mon whores are more likely to belong to the discreditable than to the respectable por- tion of their race is a reflection not likely to meet with opposition ; and here we see that among the entire criminal population of this district, only four cases of venereal disease have occurred this year. Three of the four affected were natives of India ; the remaining one, Burmese. V.( 30 ) I am inclined to think that the subject has received due attention. The Act is in operation, without reference to class, with all who live within the area of municipal boun- daries. The population in these limits consists of 18,345 Burmese and 4,072 natives of India, with others ; among whom there were during the year 39 registered prostitutes,( 31 ) No. 1.(32) No. 2.-Annual statement of the Bassein Lock-hospital for the year 1878. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Number of registered prostitutes.

I HAVE the honour to forward the reports on the lock-hospitals at Moulmein and Toungoo, the only institutions in this division, for the year 1878. The for- mer is worked under Act XIV. of 1868, and the latter under Act XXII. of 1864. 2. The hospital at Moulmein is supervised by the Town Magistrate, and visited from time to time by the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner. The registration is carried out by an Inspector of Police specially appointed to the lock-hospital under the orders of the Town Magistrate. At Toungoo there is no Sub-Committee to superintend the administration of the Act, but the Canton- ment Magistrate and Civil Surgeon practically act in that capacity. A native Police Sergeant watches over the prostitutes. 3. There has been no change in the accommodation provided during the year of report. The accommodation has apparently been found ample. 4.The situation of the Moulmein Hospital is objectionable, and has been commented on in last year's report. 5. There were 59 admissions amongst the European troops stationed at Toungoo during the year of report. Of this number, it is remarked that 11 men contracted the disease at Rangoon and six at Shwe-gyeen. The comparative immunity of the Native troops from venereal affections noticed in the report is a matter for congratulation, there being only two admissions in the year of report. 6. Amongst the civil population, the admissions increased from 167 in 1877 to 226 in 1878 ; and this increase is accounted for by the importation of the disease from Upper Burma and the Shan States. 7. A wing and head-quarters of the 33rd Regiment M. N. I. has been stationed at Moulmein during the year of report, amongst whom there were only two admissions. 8. The number of admissions amongst the civil population in Moulmein for the past five years is given : 1874 159 1875 191 1876 214 1877 292 1878 295 shewing an increase of three cases in the year of report compared with 1877. 9. The number of prostitutes on the register during the year of report in each of the two stations is given below : Toungoo 15 Moulmein 54 10. The number on the register in Moulmein at the beginning of the year 1878 was 49, 38 were newly registered during the year, and 33 struck off, leaving 54 on the register at the close of the year of report. The Civil Surgeon remarks that this can scarcely be regarded as representing the number practising prosti- tution, and much undiscovered prostitution it is feared exists. 11. At Toungoo, there were 16 remaining on 1st January 1878, and seven were registered during the year, making a total of 23, from which has to be deducted two absconded and six removed from the register, leaving 15 on the register at the close of 1878. 12. At Toungoo, five women were punished for breaches of the rules, with imprisonment, in the year of report ; and at Moulmein, 15 women were brought before the Town Magistrate, of whom two were fined, four imprisoned, and nine acquitted. 13. Registration fees are not exacted at either Toungoo or Moulmein. The institutions are therefore not self-supporting. Rupees 10 only were realized as fines at Moulmein, and credited to the funds of the institution. 14. The expenditure during 1878 of the lock-hospital at Moulmein amounted to Rs. 2,133-7-9, leaving Rs. 136-10-9 less than in 1877 ; and at
( 2 ) Toungoo Rs. 1,371-3-4 in the year of report, against Rs. 1,401-9-10 in 1877. The average cost per patient was at Moulmein Rs. 29-1-0, and at Toungoo Rs. 32-1-5. ANNUAL REPORT ON THE MOULMEIN LOCK-HOSPITAL FOR THE YEAR 1878. THERE have been no alterations made in the lock-hospital building or out-houses since the last annual report.

The amount of venereal complaints amongst the Native troops has been very small indeed. Out of a strength for the greater portion of the year of over 800 men, there were no admissions for primary syphilis or gonorrh( 9 ) The women were, as a rule, regular in their attendance. All due allowance was invari- ably made for illness or other justifiable cause which happened to keep any away. Only those who wilfully or intentionally violated the law were reported to the Cantonment Magistrate, who punished each offender as she deserved. One insane woman whose name was on the register was irregular in her attendance, but whenever examined was always found healthy. She was treated with special leniency.

RESOLUTION ON THE REPORT ON LOCK-HOSPITALS IN BRITISH BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1879. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, British Burma, in the General Department,( 2 ) in the fees which were levied at the Rangoon and Thayetmyo Lock-hospitals in the early part of the year. Under the orders of the Government of India, the levying of these fees was discontinued in the month of April 1879. 3. Owing to the disturbed state of affairs in Upper Burma, the number of European troops in this province was greater than usual during the year under review. The average strength of the garrison was 2,741 men; and the number of cases of venereal disease which occurred among them was 310, or 11.3 per cent. of the average number of men. The percentage was highest at Rangoon, where it amounted to 18.4, and lowest at Thayetmyo, where it was 7.9. These results compare favourably with those of the Bengal and Madras cantonments. The desirability of appointing Regimental Officers to Cantonment Commitees formed the subject of correspondence during the year, and the Chief Commis- sioner has intimated to the Major-General commanding the division that he would concur in the appointment by the Commander-in-Chief, under Chapter II., para- graph 1 of the Cantonment Rules, of the officers commanding the British regiment and the Royal Artillery at each station to be ex-officio members of the Cantonment Committee at that station. The suggestions made by the Government of India at the close of the year 1878, regarding the advantages of regimental control and good regimental institutions in keeping men from contracting venereal disease, have been communicated to the military authorities, and have no doubt received due attention at their hands. 4. The Rangoon Lock-hospital is by far the largest and most important in the province, and its condition and administration formed the subject of careful enquiry during the year under report. An Apothecary on Rs. 200 a month has now been appointed to the charge of the hospital, and orders have issued for the exclusive employment of an Inspector of Police and three constables in lock- hospital cases. From the Junior Civil Surgeon's report it would appear that this order has not been fully carried out, and that the Inspector has been employed on other duties than those of the lock-hospital. An explanation of this circumstance will be required. The average number of women on the register during the year 1879 was 467, as compared with an average of 472 in 1878. Of the women not in hospital, an average of 91 per cent. attended the weekly examinations, and 19 per cent. of these on an average were found to be diseased on each occasion. Last year's figures were 85.5 and 7 respectively. The total number of absentee during the year 1879 was 336. Of these, 164 absconded and have not been traced, 95 were excused on the score of sickness, and the remaining 77 were sent up to the Magistrate for punishment, 66 being convicted and 11 dis- charged. These figures show that there was no laxity in enforcing the attendance of the prostitutes at the periodical examinations. The amount of venereal disease among the European garrison was somewhat greater than in the previous year, but the figures contrast favourably with those of most Indian stations. There can be no doubt that clandestine prostitution is very extensively practised in Rangoon, and that much disease is spread in this manner; but the detection and prosecu- tion of such cases is a matter of much difficulty, and only 16 convictions were obtained throughout the year. With a view to the more efficient working of the Act, the area within which the rules are enforced has been extended so as to include all villages within a radius of seven miles of the cantonment.
(3) 5. The report on the Thayetmyo Lock-hospital is creditable to the officer Who prepared it. It shows that the Act was carefully and, on the whole, success- fully worked during the year. The number of prostitutes on the register increas- ed from 19 at the beginning to 28 at the end of the year. The attendance of the women at the weekly examinations was fairly regular, about 84 per cent. being, on an average, present at each examination. The total number of prosecutions for non-attendance was 21, but only 11 women were convicted and punished. Further particulars should have been given, showing why more prosecutions were not instituted, and why so large a number of those actually instituted resulted in a discharge. Fifty-two cases of disease occurred among the women, and the average number in hospital was 4.4. The statistics of the disease among the European and Native troops are decidedly satisfactory. The total number of cases of disease among the European troops was 7.9 per cent. of the total strength of the garrison, or 4.9 per cent. if imported cases are excluded. Among the Native troops the percentage was .7 only. It is not very clear why the suggestions of the Commanding Officer for the co-operation of the military and civil police in the detection of clandestine prostitution were not adopted. It is only with the cordial co-operation of the military authorities that prostitution can be satisfactorily con- trolled. A report on this matter will be called for. 6. The only other town at which European troops are stationed is Toungoo. Here the number of registered prostitutes is only 15, and it is evident that clandestine prostitution must be widely practised. But, apparently, only two cases were detected and punished. The attendance of the women at the periodical examinations appears from the returns to have been irregular, the percentage pre- sent at each examination having been about 70. The statement of the Medical Officer that the women were very regular in their attendance requires explanation. The number of cases of venereal disease contracted by the European troops was seven per cent. of the strength of the garrison. Among the Native troops not a single case of venereal disease occurred. This comparative immunity from disease is attributed by the Civil Surgeon to the efficient working of the Contagious Diseases Act, by which it is presumed the Cantonment Act is meant. But there is nothing in Dr. Power's somewhat meagre report to prove that this view is correct. 7. At Moulmein a small Native garrison is stationed. The average strength of the garrison in 1879 was 327, and nine cases of venereal disease occurred among the men. The number of women on the register was 54 at the beginning and 78 at the end of the year. The increase is satisfactory, but the number of registered. women should undoubtedly be much larger than it is. Twelve women were prosecuted for practising clandestine prostitution, but only three of these were convicted. The attendance of the registered women at the periodical examinations averaged 82 per cent. of the total number of the women on the register. One hundred and fifteen women were "reported to the Magistrate" for non-attend- ance, but the number of convictions is not stated. It must apparently have been very small, as the total amount of fines levied during the year, including those inflicted on two women for carrying on illicit prostitution, amounted to Rs. 15 only for the whole year. An explanation of this curious result is required. 8. The statistics of the Akyab, Bassein, and Prome Lock-hospitals do not call for special remark. The number of registered women is very small at all three
(4) stations, though there was a considerable addition to the register at Bassein, and little or no progress has been made in the control of prostitution. The attendance of the women at the periodical examinations was fair at Akyab and Bassein but very bad at Prome. It is almost impossible to judge of the effect of the Contagious Diseases Act at these stations in preventing the spread of venereal disease among the general population. No conclusions can safely be drawn from the dispensary statistics, as an increased number of cases of venereal disease might indicate, either the increasing popularity of the hospital, or an actual increase in the amount of the venereal disease in the town. At Akyab 159 cases of disease among the women were treated, 55 cases were treated at Bassein, and 43 at Prome. 9. The Deputy Surgeon-General visited each of the lock-hospitals in the course of the year, and found them all in good order.

In conclusion, I may remark that I think the Civil Surgeon goes too far in saying that the working of the Act is a farce. The mere fact that 153 cases of venereal disease have been treated in the hospital disproves this assertion. No doubt, by more vigorous police supervision over outsiders, the spread of disease could to some extent be checked; but this appears to raise the doubtful question of how far Government is justified in taking measures for the punishment of vice, or making enquiries into the private life of citizens to attain this end. With the women who are are willing to be registered it is different. I think they should be strictly dealt with and made to comply with all the provisions of the Act. AKYAB.

The average for the lock-hospital at Henzada is computed for only four months. 5. The number of women found at the periodical examinations to be diseased during the last two years was as follows :( 10 ) slight extent more prevalent in 1879 than in 1878, yet there has not been any increased ratio of disease acquired in Thayetmyo during the year 1879 on that of the former year. The Medical Officer remarks :( 11 ) they have not been carried out. The appointment of a Resident Apothecary is much needed to assist the Medical Officer in the examination of cases, &c. As regards the detective agency, Dr. Dundas reports that the Inspector of Police is not exclusively employed on lock-hospital duties : he has to look after police cases at the general hospital, to attend court all day, and besides to attend to other duties. Only two constables were employed during the year to assist the Inspector, although the Chief Commissioner sanctioned one 1st class and two 2nd class constables. Last year the Chief Commissioner sanctioned that the incurable women who were a burden to the hospital should be sent back to their native country at Gov- ernment expense. The women were, it appears, unwilling to leave Rangoon, and so no further steps were taken in the matter.

The result of the system, so far as disease acquired here is concerned, appears satisfactory ; but from the comparatively few women on the roll, the result would seem to arise from the immunity from disease among women who carry on the trade clandestinely. However, there can be no doubt that it is a necessity having an institution where diseased women can be treated.

If the efficiency of the working of the Act is judged by the amount of disease that is disseminated, and this text is a highly practical one, it would seem that the measures at present employed for the control of illicit intercourse are not unsatisfactory. Commanding Officers of regiments quartered here make no com- plaints of the prevalence of venereal disease among their troops. Lieutenant- Colonel Hand, who commands the 44th Regiment of the line, has written one letter during the year, pointing out that two of his men were admitted the same day with gonorrh( 25 ) that prostitution on the sly has extended. Some means of controlling this unlawful practice, much of which, I believe, takes place around regimental lines, ought to be employed ; but I imagine that so long as venereal disease among the troops keeps within its present limits, no Commanding Officers will readily co- operate in the introduction of measures interfering with the liberty accorded their men, or imposing new duties on their regimental police, while without assistance from the military authorities attempted reform in the direction indicated would be unavailing. Registration is supposed to extend to all classes of women living within the area protected by the Act, which is 196 square miles ; but if only the Burmese and Madrasee prostitutes practising within the limits of the town, an area of about four square miles, could all be brought on the register, the author- ities, both civil and military, might rest very well satisfied with this accomplish- ment. There was a larger number of prostitutes on the register on the last day of the year 1879 than on the last day of the previous year by nine, but the average number on the list and the average number attending the periodical examinations remained very much the same. Twenty-five names were added to, and 16 re- moved from, the roll during the year of report, while the corresponding numbers for the previous year were 23 added and 27 removed. The average number on the register was 23.6, and average number present 19.8, during the year 1879, against 24.8 registered and 20 present in 1878. It must be pointed out however that the average number on the register and the average number in actual attend- ance increased as the year 1879 became advanced, and was at its highest during the last three months of the year,( 26 ) Years. Total registered number. Average number on register. Cases of disease. 1877 53 24.9 50 1878 46 24.8 67 1879 44 23.6 50 Thus the prevalence of of disease among the women has not undergone much variation during the last three years, the proportion being less last year than in 1878, but a trifle higher than in 1877. The year 1877 however was an unusually favourable one in this particular, so that the year of review has also been, but in a smaller degree, a favourable period. It is a feature worthy of notice that the type of venereal disease among the women in Thayetmyo is a mild one. Among men it is not easy to obtain very accurate information on this point at all times, but an excellent opportunity for contrasting the degree of severity of the disease in Thayetmyo to other places is afforded when troops are transferred here from other stations. The severity of venereal disease may in a practical way be estimated by the relative number of re-admissions that it produces, the majority of which do not take place until some considerable time has elapsed from the acquisition of the primary disease. A reference to the table in para. 3 of this report will show that the 43rd Regi- ment, which arrived here in March last from Madras, had 14 re-admissions in nine months, whereas the 44th Regiment, which was stationed in Thayetmyo for the entire year, re-admitted only six men ; and further the Medical Officer in charge of the 43rd Regiment writes :( 27 ) No. I.( 28 ) No. II.( 29 ) No. III.( 30 ) From the Deputy Commissioner, Bassein, to the Commissioner of the Pegu Division,( 31 ) women ; this is seen in the smaller number of Burmans admitted into hospital, those few belonging invariably to the lower classes. These women receive their greatest support from the Kullahs and the ship- ping, the latter not unfrequently bringing the remains of a gonorrh( 32 ) ones, that younger and better looking girls coming among their ranks has con- siderably reduced their gains. Only one Kullah woman was admitted to the register, the rest being Burmese. The working of the Act extends only to municipal limits with a population of 22,041. This does not include a floating population.

No fees are levied from prostitutes. During the year 12 women were prosecuted for practising clandestine prostitution, of whom three were convicted (two fined and one imprisoned) and nine acquitted. The receipts from fines amounted to Rs. 15. A wing and head-quarters of the 33rd Regiment M. N.

RESOLUTION ON THE REPORT ON LOCK-HOSPITALS IN BRITISH BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1880. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, British Burma, in the General Department,( 2 ) and none at Thayet-myo. At Rangoon, Thayet-myo, and Toungoo the officer com- manding the European regiment and the officer commanding the Royal Artillery were appointed ex-officio members of the Cantonment Committee, with a view to their being appointed members of a Sub-Committee for supervising the working of the lock-hospital rules. It would appear, however, from the reports of the several lock-hospitals that these Sub-Committees have not yet been constituted, except perhaps at Toungoo. This is to be regretted, as it is evident that the enforcement of the lock-hospital rules would benefit by more careful and constant supervision than it receives at present. 3. At Rangoon the number of women on the register was 476 at the begin- ning and 417 at the end of the year. No less than 300 names were struck off the list. The area over which the rules are enforced was increased from 22 to 120 square miles, and orders were issued that an Inspector and three constables should be specially told off for lock-hospital work. It would appear from the report that this order was not fully carried out. The Commissioner has called for an expla- nation of this. The Chief Commissioner will be prepared to consider any pro- posal which the Commissioner may think proper to make for increasing the number of the constables assigned for this duty. The number of women on the register is probably far less than it should be, and the importance of securing more complete registration is shown by the fact that, out of 241 women who were brought on the register during the year 1881, no less than 41 were found to be diseased at the first examination. Thirty-five women were arrested for practising clandestine prostitution in the course of the year, but the number of convictions is not stated. The attendance of the women at the periodical examinations is at present very irregular, 35 per cent on an average being absent at each examina- tion. Where regular attendance is not insisted upon, a great part of the benefit to be derived from the rules must be lost, for it is only to be expected that the women who stay away from examination should be those who know themselves to be suffering from disease and who desire by absenting themselves to avoid detection. Four hundred women in all were reported to the Magistrate for non-attendance, and of these 120 were punished by fine or imprisonment. The lock-hospital building has been improved by various repairs and alterations. The appointment of a resident apothecary has been attended by good results. No great change was noticed in either the amount or virulence of the disease among the women. 4. At Thayet-myo two constables were told off at the request of the officer commanding the European troops to assist the regimental police in the enforce- ment of the lock-hospital rules, but the results were not so good as might have been expected. The number of women on the register decreased from 28 at the beginning to 23 at the end of the year, a very small number for a military cantonment of the size of Thayet-myo. Three women only were prosecuted for clandestine prostitution, and all of them were found to be diseased. Seventy- eight per cent. of the women, on an average, attended the periodical examinations. Twenty-one women were reported for non-attendance, of whom 14 were punished by fine or imprisonment. The diseases from which the registered women suffered were in most cases of a very mild type.
( 3 ) 5. At Toungoo some improvement appears to have been effected in the enforcement of the rules. The number of women on the register was increased from 15 to 26, and the percentage of women present at each periodical examina- tion was 84, as compared with 70 in 1879. The number of cases of sickness among the women was somewhat greater than in 1879, but the increased occurred among diseases of the less virulent type. 6. At Moulmein the number of women on the register decreased from 78 to 53. Three women were prosecuted for practising clandestine prostitution, but they were all acquitted. Among the registered women the percentage of attend- ance at the periodical examinations was 86. Thirteen women were prosecuted for non-attendance, and ten of them were convicted and punished. There was less disease among the women than in the previous year, and the diseases treated were mostly of a mild type. 7. At Bassein a small number of Native troops were stationed for part of the year, but the lock-hospital is maintained chiefly for the sake of the European sailors who visit the port. The number of women on the register was 32 at the beginning and 27 at the end of the year. The percentage of attendance at the periodical examinations was 81. There were no prosecutions for practising clandestine prostitution, and only two for non-attendance at examination. The diseases among the women were, with one exception, of a mild type. 8. At Akyab no troops are stationed. The average number of women on the register was 51.58, of whom 50.86 on an average attended the periodical examinations. The number of registered prostitutes at Akyab is larger in pro- portion to the population than at any other seaport except Rangoon. Neverthe- less it is reported that clandestine prostitution is largely practised, and such statistics as are available seem to show that the more virulent forms of disease among the male population were contracted from unregistered women. 9. No suggestions for improving the rules, which may be said to have worked fairly well on the whole, are made by any of the reporting officers, but there appears to be a general opinion that the police are not so energetic as they might be in the enforcement of the rules. There has been a general failure in dealing adequately with the evil of clandestine prostitution. No doubt from the habits of the people, and the general circumstances of the country, there is much difficulty in detecting and punishing the practice, and with the best efforts the agency of the police must frequently be found insufficient. But where clandestine prostitution is carried on by registered women who have absconded or by unregis- tered women in registered brothels, as appears to be often the case, it is plain that the police omit to do their duty. The Chief Commissioner would invite the attention of the Inspector-General of Police to this matter. A further complaint is made that Deputy Commissioners in some instances grant leave to prostitutes to absent themselves from periodical examinations without consulting the Civil Surgeon or informing the police. If this is the case, the practice should be stopped. Leave should in no case be given without the consent of the Civil Surgeon, and when leave is granted, the Superintendent of Police should be informed of the fact. 10. The total expenditure on lock-hospitals in the year 1880 was Rs. 25,463, or about Rs. 37 for each registered woman. In 1879 the total expenditure was
( 4 ) Rs. 26,547, or about Rs. 39 for each registered woman. The fines inflicted upon the women amounted to Rs. 1,592. No fees were levied. 11. In the month of April a case was brought to the notice of the Chief Commissioner in which two women were convicted at Akyab of obtaining posses- sion and disposing of a minor for purposes of prostitution. It appeared from the evidence that the unfortunate child who formed the subject of the case had been brought over from India and forced against her will to lead the life of a prostitute; and though at the periodical examinations it was seen that she was immature, the medical officer had not called attention to the case. At the suggestion of the Judicial Commissioner an additional rule has now been added to the lock-hospital rules requiring brothel-keepers to report monthly to the Magistrate the ages of all the women under their control, and Civil Surgeons have been directed to report immediately to the Magistrate any case of a girl under 16 holding a certificate and attending at the lock-hospital. Registering officers have been required to satisfy themselves that the girls to whom they grant certificates are over 16 years of age, and precautions have been taken to prevent personation. Enquiries have been set on foot at Rangoon, Moulmein, Akyab, and Bassein as to the exist- ence of a traffic in girls between Burma and India. Hitherto no evidence of any such traffic has been forthcoming, but it behoves Magistrates and police officers to be on the alert for the suppression of such a trade should it arise.

REPORT ON LOCK-HOSPITALS, BRITISH BURMA, FOR THE YEAR 1880. ARAKAN DIVISION. From Colonel E. B. SLADEN, M.S.C., Commissioner of the Arakan Division, to the Officiating Secretary to Chief Commissioner, British Burma,( 2 ) The percentage of venereal diseases to total diseases treated fell from 8.58 in 1879 to 5.44 in the year under report. The practice has been adopted during the year of asking infected persons where they obtained the disease, and it has been proved that a considerable part was contracted from unregistered women in the town. Some of the disease, how- ever, was contracted in the district, and some also in India and in other parts of this province. A decrease of syphilitic affections is noted, and an increase of cases of gonorrh( 3 ) X.( 4 ) Annual statement No. I of the Lock-hospital at Akyab for the year 1880. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Local Government or Administration, Date on which the lock- hospital was established.

( 7 ) Comparative statement showing the amount of venereal diseases treated amongst the civil and jail population during the past four years:( 8 ) carrying on prostitution without being registered. The source of information referred to by the Civil Surgeon in paragraphs 3 and 6 of his report is neces- sarily closed to Police Officers and Magistrates. As to the information given by registered prostitutes, some prostitutes who had been struck off the register and left the town, and afterwards returned again, were discovered by this means. In the majority of cases, however, on inquiry being made the information given was found to be without foundation, and presumably dictated by spite. 2. In one or two cases summonses were issued under the Act against Arakan- ese women: these women, on proceedings being instituted, cleared out of the town, and the chief object being thus attained matters were allowed to drop. If registra- tion is to be effective at all, it is quite certain that the present system of supervi- sion must be altered for the better. I doubt if this end would be attained by the appointment of a special officer, but can offer no suggestion in its place. 3. The attendance at the weekly examinations has been very regular. The figures given in paragraph 8 of the report, showing the proportion of punish- ments to cases reported, scarcely give a correct view of the matter. In the majority of cases reported, the women had either been granted leave of private examination, or had been permitted to leave Akyab, and there had been no time to notify this to the Civil Surgeon before the date the next inspection came round. 4. With regard to paragraph 5, I have no reason for believing that departures were reported by the police which never took place. Where the neglect lay was in the fact that when these women returned shortly afterwards, they were allowed to be some time in the town without the fact of their return being notified to the authorities. 5. The report calls for no further remarks.

( 11 ) 4. The Prome Lock-hospital was closed on the 31st August 1880 under the orders conveyed in No. 4771-4-62, dated the 15th July 1880. The report on it therefore only relates to a period of eight months. 5. The area to which the lock-hospital rules apply differs from that of last year by their extension to all places within a radius of seven miles from the boundary of Rangoon cantonment under notification No. 390 (Home, Agricultural, and Commerce Department), dated the 10th November 1879. It may be doubted if any proper effect has been given to the rules outside the former area of. 22 square miles, with a population of 99,827 souls, for the Junior Civil Surgeon has repeated these figures in his report, and the Deputy Commissioner of Rangoon has not corrected them. Moreover, Dr. Johnstone comments on the insufficiency of the existing detective system as applied to this smaller area. It is of little use to extend rules if no practical measures are taken for their being efficiently worked. 6. The number of prostitutes in Rangoon at the close of the year was only 417, against 476 on the 31st December 1879. Most of these are Telinga women, all of a low type, but 81 were Burmese. There can be no doubt that secret prostitution is practised by many Burmese women ; but it is extremely difficult to detect, and, when detected, it is even more difficult to bring the charge home to them. An increase is shown in the number of European prostitutes. At Bassein the yearly average number of prostitutes shows an increase ; but the year commenced with 32, and ended with only 27, registered women. The practice which is reported to exist of prostitutes having periods of leave from the Deputy Commissioner without reference to the Civil Surgeon would seem to require some check. If the women really absent themselves from Bassein during their leave, the working of the rules as regards Bassein is not materially affected ; but the report of the Civil Surgeon implies that the object of the Act is frustrated by the procedure adopted. At Thayet-myo there is a slight increase of prostitutes on the register. 7. The figures would seem to show that much more disease occurred amongst prostitutes in Rangoon than in any former year. It is, however, satisfactory to learn that the true explanation of these figures is to be found in the increased vigilance and energy with which detection has been carried on under the special inspector. The disease at all the hospitals has been, with a few exceptions, of a very mild type. 8. Examinations were conducted regularly at Rangoon, where the attend- ance has been fairly regular. Weekly examinations were held at Bassein, Prome, and Thayet-myo. 9. The following table shows the number of patients treated for venereal diseases at the different hospitals :( 12 ) of strength is 158.62, against 160.23 in 1879, 151.34 in 1878, and 260.02 in 1877. Primary syphilis shows only 59 cases contracted in Rangoon, against 67 in 1879. The total number of cases of disease among the European troops at Thayet- myo was 83.63 per mille of the total strength of garrison, or 55 per mille if imported cases are excluded. It is remarkable that among the Native troops, with a mean average strength of 1,675 men, there was not a single admission for treatment, although there were 17 cases of venereal disease in 1879. If any cases occurred at all, the nature of the diseases must be very mild, and never affected their constitution; so that they cured themselves with ordinary Native drugs, and did not seek hospital relief. Among two companies of Native troops stationed at Bassein for short periods no case of venereal disease occurred. 11. The great disproportion between the number of women reported to the Magistrate for infringement of rules and the number punished calls for remark. In many cases the women had absconded and could not be found; but in others leave of absence had been given, apparently without any intimation having been sent either to the Civil Surgeon or the police. It ought to be a rule that, before leave of absence is granted, the Civil Surgeon should be consulted, with a view to ensure that the woman can show a clean bill of health before proceeding to other places, where a diseased prostitute may propagate disease to an alarming extent, and that, when leave has been granted, both the lock-hospital sergeant and the police should be informed, so that on the one hand a woman really on leave may not be unnecessarily harassed, and on the other that the leave may not be converted into a mere cloak for avoiding examination. The necessity of steps being taken to prevent diseased prostitutes leaving Rangoon and carrying contagion elsewhere has been forced on my attention by the increase of disease about Leppadan on the Irrawaddy Valley (State) Railway, which at times has become a favourite resort for these women, who find their victims among the passengers by the slow trains compelled to remain at Leppadan all night in haunts which are little better than brothels. Steps are being taken to provide proper quarters for passengers at Lep- padan, but none the less is it right that the ingress of ,diseased prostitutes should be checked. 12. The total cost of the lock-hospitals in this division has been Rs. 19,205-10-5, giving an average cost of Rs. 34-5-0 per each woman. Rs. 1,554-2-0 were recovered in fines. Fees have been discontinued under the orders of the Govern- ment of India. 13. I entirely concur in the following remarks of Dr. Johnstone:( 13 ) recommend that at least five peons, the number asked for by Dr. Johnstone, should be placed under the inspector's orders. 15. The appointment of Mr. Fonseca as a resident apothecary at the Rangoon Hospital is reported to be a great improvement. Much more care is now taken in examining the women, and also in their treatment. Mr. Fonseca since his appointment has worked well and efficiently, and devoted much time to the examin- ing of the women. The discipline is much better than it was. 16. In the Chief Commissioner's resolution on the Report of 1879, the necessity of securing the cordial co-operation of the military authorities in detect- ing prostitution was strongly insisted on. A resolution was accordingly passed by the Cantonment Committee on the 23rd July 1880 that the quarter-master and adjutant of each regiment stationed in Rangoon, with the aid of the inspector of police, should supply information and take requisite steps to bring prostitutes before the magistrate. Of the practical effects of this resolution nothing is said; but as the Civil Surgeon was apparently in entire ignorance of the existence of any Sub- Committee to supervise lock-hospital work, it is to be feared that the effects were not as great as might have been hoped. At Thayet-myo the entertainment of two civil policemen to assist the regimental police in the detection of unlicensed pros- titution remained in abeyance pending the settlement of a dispute as to whether the Military or Civil Department should pay for the cost of their services, notwith- standing the admitted necessity which existed for an increased staff for the pur- pose. In the meantime prostitution on the sly was on the increase,' and the risk of increased contagion among British troops was deliberately incurred. By Secretary to the Chief Commissioner's letter No. 268, dated the 12th January 1880, the Deputy Commissioner has now been directed to arrange for the employment of two policemen under the Cantonment Magistrate to be attached to the regi- mental police for the purpose of the detection of clandestine prostitution.

H. JOHNSTONE, M.D., Superintendent.
( 29 ) BASSEIN. I.( 30 ) instance of this, the Thayet-myo garrison for the year 1879 may be taken, where a larger number of troops were on service than in any other cantonment. The average strength of the European force was 1,480 and of the Native 1,465. Among the Europeans there were 117 cases of venereal disease; while among the Natives there were only 17, so that, although there was not a single admis- sion for venereal among the small sepoy force stationed at Bassein during the year 1880, the circumstance is in no way remarkable. The returns of the civil dispensary show a decreased number of cases of venereal complaints among the applicants for medical treatment, but the improve- ment is inconsiderable. Among Burmese criminals venereal maladies are infrequent. The following table gives what information the civil hospital and jail statistics afford on the question :( 31 ) remaining on it ; their present retreat is quite as convenient as the former one, and more secluded, and no unlicensed women are allowed to share it with them. Although no prostitute women have been placed on their trial for practising without a license during the year of report, this circumstance cannot be regarded to prove that Bassein is freer from illicit prostitution than other Burmese towns, but at the same time it strongly supports the view that what does occur takes place quietly, unobtrusively, and without evil effects. I am not aware that a high degree of activity has been shown with the view to expose and suppress this clandestine prostitution, and, so long as it is conducted with privacy and without mischief, interference is perhaps uncalled for.

( 36 ) THAYET-MYO. I.( 37 ) The above table includes cases of venereal diseases (6 primary syphilis and 16 gonorrh( 38 ) was 1,394 Europeans and 1,675 Natives, besides the larger population in the town. The above fact shows what a meagre number of women are regis tered for so large a town, and how unlikely they can satisfy the desire of so large a population. Prostitution on the sly is on its increase. Native sepoys are daily seen in Burmese houses talking and joking with the women, and when this is often the case at night, their object is easily understood. Several Madrassee women, especially of the grass-cutter class, are now and then seen after dark with Euro pean soldiers in the jungle and other secluded places of cantonment. Registration has decreased considerably, probably owing to the increase of clandestine prostitution and to the absence of any active measure to suppress the latter practice. The area over which the registration extends is computed at 196 square miles, the estimated Native population of which area is about 38,000.

IP IP/16/HG.4 REPORT ON THE LOCK-HOSPITALS, BRITISH BURMA, FOR THE YEAR 1881. RANGOON : PRINTED AT THE GOVERNMENT PRESS, 1882.
RESOLUTION ON THE REPORT ON LOCK-HOSPITALS IN BRITISH BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1881. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, British Burma, in the General Department,( 2 ) It will be seen that at Rangoon the number of cases has been gradually diminishing from year to year, whereas at Thayetmyo there has been an annual increase. At Toungoo the number of cases in 1879 and 1880 was about the same, while in 1881 the number of cases of venereal disease increased from 33 to 83, and the ratio per mille was thus more than doubled. In the year 1880 the Major-General, with the concurrence of the Chief Commissioner, appointed the Commanding Officers of the European regiment and of the Royal Artillery to be additional members of the Cantonment Committees at Rangoon, Toungoo, and Thayetmyo. The intention was that these officers should be appointed members or sub-committees to be formed for the purpose of supervising the working of the lock-hospital rules. It would appear, however, that no such sub-committees have as yet been appointed. The attention of the Committees was invited to this matter in 1881. Reports will now be called for as to the action that has been taken in the matter. It is very desirable that the cordial and active co-operation of the officers of the European regiments should be obtained in the enforcement of the lock-hospital rules at military stations. 3.The Native troops appear to have enjoyed, as in previous years, a remark- able immunity from venereal disease. There were only 18 cases at Rangoon, 3 at Thayetmyo, 6 at Toungoo, and 19 at Moulmein. The Civil Surgeon at Toungoo is of opinion, however, that the sepoys frequently treat themselves for diseases of this class, and it is possible therefore that more cases may have occurred than are shown in the returns. 4.The average number of prostitutes on the register at Rangoon was 436, as compared with an average of 496 in the previous year. The average attend- ance at the weekly examinations (including women in hospital) was 87 per cent. of the total number on the register, as compared with an average attendance of 85 per cent. in 1880. The Civil Surgeon is of opinion that the rules were more strictly enforced in 1881 than in the previous year, a view which is to some extent borne out by the improvement in the attendance at the periodical examinations and by the fact that 110 women were prosecuted for soliciting or practising prostitution without a license, as compared with 35 so prosecuted in 1880. The number of women prosecuted for non-attendance at the periodical examinations was 212 in 1880 and 216 in 1881 ; the number of convictions was 120 in the former and 136 in the latter year. It is satisfactory to find that there was less disease both among the women themselves and among the European troops than there was in 1880, and also that the character of the disease throughout the year was, as stated by the Civil Surgeon, " exceedingly mild. " The net cost of the institution to Govern- ment was Rs. 12,800, or an average of Rs. 29 for each prostitute on the register. In 1880 the net cost was somewhat higher, but the average cost for each prostitute was about the same. The lock-hospital building is not large enough for the require- ments of the town. It has not hitherto been enlarged, as the site was consider- ed objectionable and it was proposed to erect a new building elsewhere. The attempt to find a better site has, however, proved a failure, and it appears necessary therefore that either the present building should be enlarged or else that an entirely new building should be erected on the same site. The Civil Surgeon is of opinion that the number of constables told off specially for the enforcement of the lock-hospital rules should be increased from three to five. The Commissioner
(3) agrees, with him, and the Inspector-General of Police will be requested to arrange accordingly. Some increase to the lock-hospital establishment appears to be also required. The necessary proposals for such increase should be submitted to the Chief Commissioner in the usual way. 5.The results of the year's work at Thayetmyo are not satisfactory. As already stated, the number of cases of venereal disease among the European troops was greater than in either of the two previous years, and the Civil Surgeon alleges, without, however, mentioning how the figure is arrived at, that about 80 per cent. of these cases were contracted from unlicensed women. The registration of pros- titutes is described as " far from being efficient or satisfactory." The matter deserves the careful attention of the District Magistrate and Cantonment Com- mittee. The average number of women on the register was less in 1881 than in 1880 ; the average attendance at the periodical examinations, however, showed a slight improvement. The cost of the institution to Government (Rs. 1,431) was about the same as in the previous year. 6.At Toungoo there was a great increase of disease among the European troops. It appears probable that this was partly due to the escape of two diseased women from the lock-hospital in November. The number of cases of primary syphilis which appeared among the troops in the following month was greater than the total number of the eleven previous months, and the results for the whole year were proportionately affected. The lock-hospital is said to be in a dilapidated condition. Proposals for either repairing the old building or erect- ing a new one should be submitted ; and in the meanwhile efforts should be made to render the registration of prostitutes more efficient. There were at the end of the year only 17 women on the register, as compared with 26 at the end of 1880, and it is evident that there must be much undiscovered clandestine prostitution. The Magistrate is taking steps to improve the present unsatisfactory state of affairs. Except in so far as the escape of the two women above referred to was facilitated thereby, it does not appear that the increase in venereal disease can be attributed to the condition or site of the hospital. The cost of the hospital to Government was Rs. 1,644 for the year. 7.At Moulmein the average number of prostitutes on the register was 51.25, as compared with an average of 61.42 in 1880. The average attendance at the periodical examinations was 97 per cent. of the total number on the register, as compared with 86 per cent. in 1880. The cost of the institution to Government (Rs. 2,320) was about the same as in the previous year. There were more cases of disease among the women, but the disease was generally of a mild type. 8.There were on an average 58 prostitutes on the register at Akyab and 25, at Bassein. The corresponding numbers for the previous year were 51 and 28. Eighty-one women were detained for treatment in hospital at Akyab and 20 at Bas- sein, and it may be hoped that the spread of venereal disease was thereby to some extent checked. The cost of the Akyab hospital was Rs. 2,227 for the year and that of the Bassein hospital Rs. 1,926. The Civil Surgeon at Bassein is endeavouring to reduce the cost of the lock-hospital, which appears to be at present excessive. By order of the Chief Commissioner, G. D. BURGESS, Secretary.

REPORT ON LOCK-HOSPITALS, BRITISH BURMA, FOR THE YEAR 1881. ARAKAN DIVISION. From Colonel E. B. SLADEN, M. S. C., Commissioner of the Arakan Division, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, British Burma,( 2 ) There are no Arakanese on the register. This is partly to be accounted for by the fact that their place is in a great part supplied by women from India, and partly to the fact that the Arakanese women, however immoral their habits may be, do not, except in rare instances, follow prostitution as a trade. When an Arakanese woman is put on the register she either leaves the town or nominally takes a hus- band. The venereal disease in the town, according to Dr. Foster's report, is very small, and I think it would be unwise to order the police to interfere more in the matter than at present. The building is in a disgraceful state. The Assistant Commissioner has explained how it is that delay and con- fusion are caused by the women not waiting for their tickets. Remarks by D. J. A. CAMPBELL, Esq., c.s., Assistant Commissioner, Akyab, on the Akyab Lock-hospital report for 1881. THE marked decrease in the percentage of cases of venereal disease noted in paragraph 3 affords proof that the control of prostitution cannot be so defective as alleged in paragraph 5.

( 7 ) Comparative statements showing the amount of venereal diseases treated amongst the civil and jail population during the past five years :( 8 ) PEGU DIVISION. From Lieutenant-Colonel C. W. STREET, M.S.C., Commissioner of the Pegu Division, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, British Burma,( 9 ) of in-patients during the year has been 91.41, that is, 11.18 less than last year. Nevertheless an average of 20 more than there is accommodation for is too much, although to a certain extent it is alleviated by using the verandahs. The apothecary's quarters are infinitely too small, and I would recommend that they be enlarged. II.( 10 ) The weekly returns of venereal diseases amongst the European troops are regularly submitted by the principal Medical Officer, the details of which are given below for each regiment :( 11 ) From the above table it will be seen that the year under review contrast most favourably with any of the preceding four years ; in fact admissions have been nearly reduced to one-half. The following table shows the number of admissions each month of the year:( 12 ) The subjoined statement shows the number of women arrested during the year arranged under the various sections of the Act :( 13 ) There are thus 378 on the register on the last day of the year, against 417 and 476 of 1880 and 1879 respectively, so that the numbers have fallen off considerably. Seeing the numbers that have been arrested for soliciting and also practising unlicensed prostitution, one cannot say that registration is effective in including all the prostitutes. But at the same time, because more have been arrested carrying on clandestine prostitution, I would not say that such was on the increase, but rather that more care and time have been devoted to the working of the Act during the past year ; and at the same time I believe that these arrests will tend to diminish the tendency to clandestine prostitution, because the women will find it is of no avail. Registration extends to all classes, Europeans, Natives, and Burmese. The Natives, chiefly Telugu women, are the most numerous. The number of the Burmese remains much the same as in the previous year. The area over which the Act extends has been much increased, since it has been extended to an area of seven miles beyond municipal limits; it extends now over about an area of 102 square miles and a population of about 185,723 souls. It is on this account that over such an area and population I think the staff insufficient. I would recommend it to be increased. Defective as registration may be, still, from what I have seen of the working of the Act, I have no hesitation in saying it is produc- tive of much benefit to the community at large.

( 19 ) IRRAWADDY DIVISION. From G. J. S. HODGKINSON, Esq., c.s., Commissioner of the Irrawaddy Division, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, British Burma,-No. 234, dated the 10th February 1882. I HAVE the honour to submit in original the reports on the working of the lock- hospitals in the Irrawaddy division which have been received from the Civil Sur- geons in charge through the District Officer. 2. There are two lock-hospitals in this division,( 20 ) From Colonel W. MUNRO, M.S.C., Deputy Commissioner, Bassein, to the Commissioner of the Irrawaddy Division,( 21 ) The servants, excepting the matron, live in the general dispensary com- pound, and only one kitchen is made use of for both the general dispensary and the lock-hospital. The patients are fed at Government expense, and when in the hospital they are supplied with suitable bedding and cots. No change of any kind has taken place during the year. II.( 22 ) VI.( 23 ) sufficient light in it. It is supplied with a good table and is provided with all the necessary instruments, medicines, furniture, &c. X.( 24 ) mans, who rarely resort to a public prostitute, but who do visit those who practise clandestine prostitution and thus run the risk of getting the disease. XI.( 25 ) Till now there was a separate hospital assistant getting the full pay of his rank. The full pay of a hospital assistant varies from Rs. 37-8-0 to Rs. 82-8-0, according to his rank, &c. The last incumbent used to get Rs. 52-8-0 for this one duty, which was very little after all. Now, at my suggestion, the Deputy Surgeon-General has given the work to the dispensary hospital assistant, who gets Rs. 10 only and does the same work satisfactorily. Besides the general dispensary establishment is so scanty that the present lock-hospital servants have to be employed on the dispensary work. This, I think, is not proper. If the dispensary establishment be increased to what it ought to be as given in Cooke's Manual, page 549, not a single servant, except a matron, would be required for the lock-hospital. As it is at present, the municipality saves something and the Government are unfairly out of pocket. Thus it will be seen that by carrying out the above suggestions the expenses of this lock-hospital will be reduced very nearly to one-half. In the Chief Commissioner's Resolution No. 4002-63M. on lock-hospitals, the following paragraph occurs :( 26 ) Annual statement No. I of the Bassein Lock-hospital for the year 1881. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Local Government or Administration.

I.( 30 ) somewhat higher than the ratio for the two preceding years, which were as follow :( 31 ) Made the true occupant of the house is pointed out, and on examination is generally found to be free from disease. I would notice here too the illicit prostitution that takes place in the vicinity of the regimental lines among the low castes of Madrassi women. I believe the most virulent type of syphilitic disease prevails amongst women of this class. I can suggest nothing new as a remedy for the evils further than greater vigilance and more hearty co-operation between the civil and military police and the imposition of more severe and deterrent punishments on offenders. VI.( 32 ) This table shows that there has been but little fluctuation either in the num- bers registered, attendance, or cases of disease. The type of disease amongst the women and men who contract disease here is remarkably mild ; this seems to have been the case for years past. It is very seldom that grave constitutional disturbance results from the supervention of secondary symptoms, which are evanescent in character. No women are received into the lock-hospital for non-venereal affections, nor are the registered prosti- tutes detained. during their menstrual periods.

( 43 ) From Major G. A. STROVER, M. S. C., Deputy Commissioner, Toungoo, to the Commissioner of the Tenas- serim Division,( 44 ) be done than is done at present towards detecting such cases. No fees have been levied from registered prostitutes during the year. 6. In conclusion I regret having to submit such an unsatisfactory report of the year's work. It is evident that prompt and effective measures are required to check the spread of these diseases generally. I have offered rewards for convictions in case of illicit prostitution, and trust that an improvement in the working of the cantonment rules, &c., will be effected before long. P.S.( 45 ) It will be seen that this rise took place more particularly in the month of December, when there were no less than 18 men admitted for primary syphilis. This I am able partly to explain from the following circumstance. On the 18th November last two women escaped from the lock-hospital, one of whom was suffering from severe syphilitic affection, the other from gonorrh( 46 ) once or twice during the week and daily by the Native doctor for the purpose of treating the in-patients.

RESOLUTION( 2 ) These figures include only cases of disease actually contracted in the several stations. In the report for Toungoo the division between imported cases and those contracted in the station is not clearly shown. It is possible therefore that the average at Toungoo should be less than that shown in the above table. In com- pliance with standing orders all cases of disease wherever contracted should be shown in the returns; but care should be taken in future reports that cases known to have been imported and relapses are distinguished from fresh cases of disease actually contracted in the station. Taking together all the admissions for venereal disease in the three stations, the ratio per mille to average strength was 191 as compared with 125 in the previous year. It does not appear from the figures that any progress is being made towards the attainment of the end for which the lock- hospitals are maintained. At Rangoon and Thayetmyo the ratio of admissions for venereal disease to the average strength of the European troops of the garrison is higher than it was in any of the three preceding years; while the statistics for Toungoo show that at this station the proportion of admissions is rapidly and steadily increasing. At the various civil dispensaries the number of admissions for venereal disease was 2,474 in 1881 and 3,033 in 1882, but the disease is said to have been generally of a milder type in the latter than in the former year. 3. In Rangoon, Thayetmyo, and Toungoo the working of the lock-hospital rules was nominally under the supervision of a special Cantonment Sub-Committee. The reports do not show whether these Sub-Committees took any steps to carry out the duties for which they were constituted. In the course of the year sanction was accorded to the grant of rewards to informers out of the proceeds of fines imposed for breaches of the rules. At Rangoon and Toungoo special police were told off for the control of the licensed women and for the prevention of illicit prostitution within the military lines. So far these measures appear to have met with very little success. 4. The following table shows the average number of prostitutes on the register at each town, together with the average attendance at periodical exami- nations during the past two years:( 3 ) 5. The total receipts from fees and fines amounted to Rs. 1,946. Fees were only levied at Thayetmyo. The practice of levying fees has been prohibited and must be at once discontinued. The expenditure of the year amounted to Rs. 24,064, of which Rs. 5,606 was borne by Government and Rs. 18,458 by muni- cipal, town, and cantonment funds. By order, E. S. SYMES, Offg. Secretary.
REPORT ON LOCK-HOSPITALS, BRITISH BURMA, FOR THE YEAR 1882. IN accordance with instructions conveyed in Juniors Secretary's endorsement No. 327-9S., dated the 13th February last, the form in which the lock-hospital report is this year submitted is somewhat different from that adopted in previous years. The statistics of the various hospitals have been tabulated together and the facts dealt with in the divisional reports embodied in one general report for the province. The divisional reports were submitted to the Deputy Surgeon- General : his remarks thereon will be found in the appendix in his letter No. 359, dated the 11th April. The delay in submitting this report is principally due to the fact that one of the divisional reports submitted through a municipality did not reach this office till the 8th of the present month, when and for some time after I was engaged on work that could not be delayed.

SINCLAIR, M.B., Inspector-General of Jails with Civil Medical Administra- tion, British Burma, in the various visitors'-books of lock-hospitals in British Burma. I WAS personally in charge of the Rangoon lock-hospital whilst Surgeon- Major H. Johnstone was on leave ; more space was required and it was suggested that the basement be enclosed by jaffery work. Greater facilities for ablution, local and general, appeared necessary and an arrangement similar to that recom- mended in my remarks on the Akyab lock-hospital was proposed ; the other changes requisite have been noticed in the body of the report. Dr. Kelly inspected the lock-hospital at Thayetmyo on the 27th April and his remarks on it are hereto appended :( 2 ) floor suggests. An isolated building used as a bathroom and apparently not long since put up is very unsuited to its purpose. It was imperfectly equipped and, from its look, I should imagine was but rarely resorted to. A bathroom in connection with an institution of this sort should have a reservoir of water in an elevated position with a flexible tube and nozzle reaching to the floor : this arrangement is inexpensive but is invaluable to the patients, who should have con- stant access thereto. The other outhouses are in fair order and seem to answer their purpose. The enclosure was generally tidy, but is too large and must cost a deal to keep in order during the rains. If any alterations in respect to the extent of its area is undertaken, a fence more suited to the requirements of a lock- hospital should be provided. There are 57 women on the register ; of these 3 were under treatment. The medicines were neatly arranged in suitable almirahs ; and the surgical instruments appear to be carefully looked after. One of the specula was cracked : this should be returned to the Medical Storekeeper. The office records were up to date. Dr. Dalzell reports favourably of the hospital assistant. Moulmein, 26th and 27th December 1882.-Made the annual inspection of the lock-hospital on the above dates. The premises, including the cookhouse and latrines, were fairly clean, but the buildings are all old and have a tumbledown appearance ; their position too by the side of a public thoroughfare, and overlooked by several residences on the hill and by the inmates of the dispensary, does not seem well chosen. As at every other station in Burma where an institution of this sort is maintained, the Civil Surgeon complains that its usefulness is much impaired by the lax police supervision under which much clandestine prostitution is practised. There are but 60 on the register, 5 of whom are on the sick list. The sick have every comfort and are well provided with the means of ablution. Medicines and records are kept in the General Hospital.

RESOLUTION ON THE REPORT ON LOCK-HOSPITALS IN BRITISH BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1883. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, British Burma, in the General Department,( 2 ) vary from year to year. The attendance of the women at the periodical examina- tions was good at Akyab, Thayetmyo, and Toungoo, indifferent at Bassein and Moulmein, and bad at Rangoon. The Sanitary Commissioner should prescribe the adoption of a uniform practice in recording the statistics of the attendance of women for examination. For purposes of comparison the figures in the report are useless. At Akyab, Moulmein, and Toungoo the proportion of women found diseased was lower than in 1882 ; at other places the reverse was the case. At Rangoon and Toungoo the number of cases of disease was more than double the average number of women on the register. The total number of admissions to hospital was 1,228 as compared with 1,083 in 1882. Five hundred and twenty-six women were prosecuted for breaches of the rules. 3. As regards the amount of protection afforded by the lock-hospitals and the rules under which they are maintained, it appears that at Rangoon and Thayet- myo there was a decrease in the ratio of admissions to hospital of patients suffering from venereal disease to the strength of the European garrison, while at Toungoo there was a considerable increase. An examination of the statistics shows that at Rangoon the ratio of cases has fluctuated from year to year, 1881 giving the lowest and 1882 the highest ratio in the last five years. At Thayetmyo the ratio has steadily increased since 1879 until the year under review, which gives a lower ratio than any of the preceding four years. At Toungoo the ratio of admissions has risen year by year since 1880. During the past year at Rangoon nearly one-fifth and at Toungoo more than one-fourth of the European troops suffered from venereal disease. Of 141 cases shown in the Rangoon returns 140 are said to have been locally acquired; while only 37 cases were locally acquired at Thayetmyo, where the strength of the garrison is little less than at Rangoon. The value of the returns for purposes of comparison is diminished by the fact that in the Rangoon report no distinction is made between new cases and relapses, while at Toungoo cases locally acquired are not distinguished from imported cases. In the Chief Commissioner's Resolution on the lock-hospital report for 1882 attention was drawn to the necessity for distinguishing these cases. In future these instructions should be observed. In Moulmein, Akyab, and Bassein there are scarcely any materials for estimating the amount of protection afforded by the lock-hospital regulations. As far as can be seen this protection is slight, for the number of admissions to hospital of patients suffering from venereal disease increased in each of these towns. The number of women on the registers is very small in proportion to the population. 4. The voluntary abandonment of the control of these institutions by the Municipal Committees of Rangoon and Moulmein once more brings before the Chief Commissioner the consideration of the question whether the maintenance of lock-hospitals is productive of any benefit, or whether the benefits derived are in any way proportionate to the many and obvious objections which are brought against the existence of these institutions and the enforcement of rules in connec- tion with them. Enquiry into this matter as far as relates to the seaport towns was made in 1880, when the Deputy Surgeon-General recommended that the hospitals at Akyab and Bassein should be closed. In deference to the opinion expressed by the local officers the Chief Commissioner agreed to maintain the hospitals for the benefit of the seafaring visitors to the ports. At the same time special orders were issued in the Chief Commissioner's Resolution, No. 63M., dated the
( 3 ) 10th June 1881, that the Civil Surgeons of those towns should arrange to collect statistics bearing on the prevalence of venereal disease among the sailors and on the protection afforded by the lock-hospitals and should report the result. Nearly three years have elapsed but these reports have not yet been received. In his annual report for the past year Mr. Foster, the late Civil Surgeon of Akyab, points out that at that town the number of registered women decreased, while the number of cases of venereal disease treated in the General Hospital increased, and that these latter cases were much more severe than those treated in the lock-hospital. Mr. Foster believes that the rules under the Act give great protection to sailors during the shipping season though, unless special measures are taken, the maintenance of the hospital at other times is of doubtful benefit. The Civil Surgeon of Bassein has been at some pains to collect statistics but without much success. He is in favour of retaining the hospital, and the Deputy Commissioner and the Port Officer concur in his views. The Civil Surgeon of Moulmein does not discuss the subject. The following table gives the principal statistics in all the places where lock-hospitals are maintained for the past five years :

( 5 ) The table shows that during the past five years in the towns where lock- hospitals have been maintained venereal diseases have increased in frequency among the European troops and apparently also among the general population. Whether the increase would have been more rapid if the lock-hospitals had not been maintained, or whether it would have been less rapid if the rules had been more strictly enforced, it is impossible to say ; but it must be admitted that the statistics fail to show that any advantage has been derived from the enforcement of the rules. 5. For some years the question under discussion has occupied the attention of the Medical authorities in India. In his eighteenth annual report the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India remarks, regarding the enforcement of the lock-hospital system in cantonments, that " year by year it becomes more " and more evident that, however successful such a system promised to be when it " was originally adopted, its practical working in this country has proved a com- " plete failure." In his nineteenth report, referring to the above-quoted passage, the Sanitary Commissioner says : " Another year's experience confirms the con- clusion then arrived at." Regarding the working of the Act in Calcutta he makes the following statements : " The evils however which are inseparable from the " operation of any such enactment in this country are very grave. The system of " registration and inspection therein provided necessitates an interference with the " people in their most intimate social relations, which is in all countries objec- " tionable but specially so in India where, owing to native customs and other " special conditions, all attempt at such interference is beset with peculiar diffi- " culties and involves a constant risk of oppression and injustice. While the evils " inseparable from the Act are of a serious and embarrassing character, the " benefit derived from it is, on the other hand, very doubtful. In accordance " with these views the Act has been suspended in the town of Calcutta with " effect from the 15th March 1883, and the question of its suspension in the " towns of Madras and Bombay is under consideration. Where the Act has been " withdrawn the results are to be carefully watched, and the lock-hospitals " replaced by a specially organized system of dispensary and hospital relief which " shall be strictly voluntary." The Chief Commissioner agrees generally with these views and commends the subject to the careful consideration of the Muni- cipal Committees at Akyab and Bassein, whose opinion will be invited as to whether the Contagious Diseases Acts should continue to be enforced in those towns or not. At Moulmein the Committee have given up the management of the lock-hospital. The Chief Commissioner does not think it necessary to maintain it as a provincial institution. Arrangements will therefore be made for closing the hospital with effect from the 1st June next, after which date the provisions of the Contagious Diseases Act will no longer be enforced in Moulmein. At Rangoon, Thayetmyo, and Toungoo, if the Military authorities desire that the lock-hospitals shall continue to be maintained, the Chief Commissioner will not at present recommend their abolition. But he will be prepared to consider any proposal to this end which the Military authorities may desire to make. By order, E. S. SYMES, Offg. Secretary.

In Moulmein order is said to be maintained in the lines for prostitutes by an inspector of police. During the year 11 were brought up for practising clandestine prostitution, of whom 7 were convicted (4 imprisoned and 3 fined) and 4 acquitted; 12 for non-attendance at periodical examination: all were imprisoned. Beyond the registration of acknowledged prostitutes nothing is done at Akyab, and not a single Arakanese woman is on the register though numbers live by prostitution. The special measures adopted at Bassein were the prevention of unlicensed women entering the brothel lines and the registration of such as were found carry- ing on clandestine prostitution. Ten were prosecuted for practising without licenses; of these 4 were fined, 5 put on the register, and 1 discharged.

RESOLUTION ON THE REPORT ON LOCK-HOSPITALS IN BRITISH BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1884. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, British Burma, in the General Department,( 2 ) Admissions to civil dispensaries on account of venereal diseases increased from 3,114 in 1883 to 3,380 in the year under review. Except at Bassein, where there was a decrease, the number of admissions at each of the towns where lock-hospitals are maintained was greater than in the previous year. 3. The same measures as have been adopted in former years were taken to suppress illicit prostitution. But the figures in the report seem to indicate that the rules were enforced with even less vigour than heretofore. Only 266 unregis- tered women were arrested for breach of the rules, as compared with 526 in 1883. At Toungoo there was only one prosecution, a fact which goes far to explain the unfavourable results noticed above. 4. The average number of women registered as prostitutes did not materially differ from the number in previous years. Except at Akyab and Thayetmyo, where there was a slight falling off, the attendance at the hospital inspections was more regular than in previous years. Three hundred and twenty-four registered women were arrested for breaches of rules, of whom 151 were punished. These figures are much lower than in 1883, the reason apparently being that the women behaved better than in that year. The number of cases of disease among regis- tered women decreased from 1,228 in 1883 to 956 in the past year; and in every hospital the percentage of cases of disease to the average number of women on the register was less in 1884 than in the preceding year. From a comparison of these figures with the statistics above quoted of the prevalence of disease among the civil and military population, it would seem that the steps taken to enforce the rules which prohibit illicit prostitution are quite ineffectual. It is clearly desirable that the authorities to whom is entrusted the immediate working of the system should make more strenuous efforts to prevent the rules from becoming a dead letter. By order of the Chief Commissioner, H. THIRKELL WHITE, Offg. Secretary.
REPORT ON LOCK-HOSPITALS, BRITISH BURMA, FOR THE YEAR 1884. THE statistical facts regarding the various lock-hospitals in this province are tabulated in the appendix. In examining these and other statements in the body of the report, it should be borne in mind that the lock-hospital at Moulmein was closed on the 1st June, as ordered in paragraph 5 of the Resolution on the Report for 1883. The Municipal Committees at Akyab and Bassein have resolved to continue to support their local institutions. I.( 2 ) Moulmein.( 3 ) the latter till closed. Nominally there are Cantonment Committees at Rangoon, Thayetmyo, and Toungoo, but, as Surgeon Smith says of the last, which seems to be true of Rangoon also, " it appears to have no working existence." V.( 4 ) On the whole the attendance would seem to have been more regular. In- formation as to the number of individual women reported for non-attendance will be found at column 10, statement II. A uniform method of calculating the number of reports has been followed in compiling this column. Irregular attendance is usually attributed to inefficient controlling agency. The following table shows the number of women arrested, punished, and acquitted, and the number of desertions:( 5 ) In the following table the diseases with which the women were affected are classified:( 6 ) " future generations may participate; (2) the large amount of sickness and invalid- " ing of which it is the cause in the British Army; (3) the large increase which " has occurred since the precipitate repeal of the Contagious Diseases Act in England, " I think most strongly that no existing machinery for ameliorating the evil should " lightly be abandoned, but that efforts should be made in the direction of strength- " ening this in every possible way. However inadequate in its results the system " may be, there is no doubt that the segregation of each single infected woman is " a clear gain of the utmost possible value, a gain to be measured only by the " extent of her capabilities of mischief.APPENDICES.

McNEALE DONNELLY, Esq., M.D., Officiating Deputy Surgeon-General, Her Majesty's Forces, British Burma Division, to the Inspector-General of Jails, with Civil Medical Administration, British Bur- ma,( 2 ) In estimating the cost to the State of the lock-hospitals of this province, it would be of practical importance could we tell with accuracy the full extent of the evil which may ultimately flow from these 50 cases of syphilis. But if a conjec- ture were allowable, that evil may not unfairly be regarded as small when we con- template the mild and curable form of the disease in the present day and divest our minds of the terrible pictures of it that history presents us with as having no place save in the jaundiced imagination of the syphiliphobist. The foregoing remarks may be summed up in a few words. The Act itself possesses inherent defects, the working of it entails much unsatisfactory labour upon those entrusted with it, and much anxious vigilance that the invasion of private rights involved in the process may be reduced to a minimum, while hitherto the resulting benefits have been small, if not problematical.
IP/16/HG.4 REPORT ON THE LOCK-HOSPITALS, BRITISH BURMA, FOR THE YEAR 1885. RANGOON : PRINTED AT THE GOVERNMENT PRESS, 1886.
RESOLUTION ON THE REPORT ON LOCK-HOSPITALS IN BRITISH BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1885. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, British Burma, in the General Department,( 2 ) ance at the periodical examinations. There was a considerable improvement in Thayetmyo, but in Toungoo the percentage of attendance to the number on the register was considerably less than in 1884. Greater activity than in 1884 was shown in punishing licensed prostitutes for breaches of the rules. The number of women who absconded diminished from 170 in 1884 to 53 in 1885. Only four cases of desertion are reported from Rangoon, which in 1884 supplied the whole number of desertions for the province. The reason for this improvement appears to be that the Magistrate now issues summonses immediately returnable, whereas the former practice of fixing a date for appearance afforded time for flight. The same procedure might with advantage be introduced in Thayetmyo, where out of 53 women cited before the Courts 49 absconded. The Chief Commissioner is unable to agree with the Deputy Surgeon-General that it is desirable that warrants should be issued in the first instance against women accused of breach of the rules. By order of the Chief Commissioner, E. S. SYMES, Offg. Secretary.

RANGOON: PRINTED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT, GOVERNMENT PRINTING, BURMA. APRIL 1887. [Price, Re. 0-6-0.]
RESOLUTION ON THE REPORT ON LOCK-HOSPITALS IN LOWER BURMA FOR The year 1886. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Burma, in the General Department,( 2 ) arrests 53 were made in Rangoon and 9 in Thayetmyo. No arrests were made in any other towns. There was a similar decrease in the number of licensed women arrested and punished. Only 179 were arrested as against 358 in 1885. All of the women arrested (except one, who absconded) were convicted, 40 being sentenced to imprisonment and 138 to fine. The fines levied decreased from Rs. 1,940 to Rs. 1,391. 4. Generally speaking the report for 1886 is an unsatisfactory one. There was an increase in disease among European soldiers, and at the same time much less activity was shown than in former years in enforcing the rules. In Rangoon, in particular, the rules were less efficiently administered than in previous years. During the year under review the Rangoon Cantonment Committee were consulted as to the measures necessary for securing better results in future. The Committee advised that an increase was necessary in the number of policemen specially employed on duties connected with the Lock-hospital. Three additional policemen were accordingly detailed from the town police for Lock-hospital work, and the Cantonment Committee was desired specially to supervise the working of the rules. The Chief Commissioner regrets to observe that the increase in the establishment has not been followed, so far as can be judged by statistics, by a more efficient administration of the rules. He would again invite the attention of the Cantonment Committee to the necessity for close supervision by them of the officers employed on work connected with the Lock-hospital. The Junior Civil Surgeon gives it as his opinion that efficient administration of the rules is impeded by the procedure adopted by the Magistrate in declining to issue pro- cess against women accused of illicit prostitution except on the deposition of an informer. The District Magistrate will be invited to report on the necessity for the procedure to which objection is taken. It seems improbable, however, that the introduction of a slightly more cumbrous procedure than that formerly prevailing can have had so serious an effect as is ascribed to it by the Junior Civil Surgeon. The Chief Commissioner is inclined to believe that the falling off in the number of prosecutions under the rules must rather be attributed to lax working on the part of the police. By order of the Chief Commissioner, C. G. BAYNE, Junior Secretary.
REPORT ON LOCK-HOSPITALS, LOWER BURMA, FOR The year 1886. THE usual statistical tables showing (1) the area over which the rules for the prevention of venereal disease and the details of expenditure on lock- hospitals, (2) the operation of the rules, and (3) the receipts and expenditure on account of these institutions, as well as the funds from which this expendi- ture has been paid, will be found in the Appendix. An interesting review of the reports of the Superintendents of the different lock-hospitals by Deputy Sur- geon-General Donnelly, C.B., to whom they were submitted for criticism, also appears in the Appendix. I.( 2 ) Excluding imported cases and relapses, of which there were 25 at Rangoon, 37 at Thayetmyo, and. 49 at Toungoo (altogether 111 as against 22 in 1885), the admis- sions at these stations, which numbered 370 in 1885, amount to 353 in the year under review, the ratios per thousand of average strength being 198.8 and 261.73 respectively. Venereal disease has consequently been relatively more prevalent during 1886 than in any other year of which the foregoing table takes cognizance. It will be observed that the excess rate is entirely due to the admissions at Ran- goon, the admissions at the other two stations being absolutely and relatively smaller than during 1885. Surgeon-Major Baker attributes the exceptional pre- valence at Rangoon to the constantly changing garrison and novelty of surround- ings which, in his experience, invariably conduce to this result. The large number of imported cases met with at Thayetmyo and at Toungoo are attributed by Surgeons Frenchman and Rundle to similar causes. The former writes : " The large number of military posts and detachments that were " out of the station accounts for the rise in imported cases. I am not able to give " here the number of cases imported from each military post as the statistics are " not at hand, but the general impression is that more cases were imported from the " other side of the old frontier, especially from Minhla ; " and the latter says: " " During the months of October and November the Royal West Surrey Regiment " (strength 769) and South Wales Borderers (strength 378) together contributed " 49 cases." In the following statement, from which importations and relapses are excluded, the admissions of the soldiers to hospital for the past two years are classified :( 3 ) " illicit prostitution while during the preceding eight months Rs. 380 were so " collected, it would, taken in connection with the fact that the registered prosti- " tutes have become fewer, appear as ,if the measure had been the reverse of " useful." Surgeon Dalzell, Akyab, reports : " Very special measures were adopted to " check illicit prostitution, and every effort was directed by the Superintendent " and staff to make the working of the hospital efficient, but for lack of the " cordial co-operation of the police these efforts were to a great extent annulled." Elsewhere the measures in force for the control of prostitution appear to have been the same as in former years and with similar unsatisfactory results. VI.( 4 ) VIII.( 5 ) 1886 the percentages of sick (calculated on the average number on the register and the average number in hospital) were approximately 16 and 15 respectively. In the following statement the disease amongst the women are classified :APPENDICES.

MCNEALE DONNELLY, Esq., C .B., M.D., Deputy Surgeon-General, Her Majesty's Forces, Burma Division, to the Inspector-General of Jails, with Civil Medical Administration, Burma,( 2 ) Of the 289 admissions at this station 143 were for primary, 39 for secondary syphilis, and 107 from gonorrh( 3 ) render it one from which Police Officers shrink. It is doubtful if this would meet the matter. An Inspector who has acquired two years experience is likely to be more efficient than one just appointed, while a special and liberal allowance is better calculated to reconcile most officers to onerous or vexatious duties than a remote contingency of preferment. One conclusion, however, can scarcely be escaped from on reading these narratives of the year's proceedings, and it is that, without a competent staff and vigilant aid from Police and Magistrates, the benefits conferred on troops by the existence of lock-hospitals can never be of any marked advantage. There is another deduction, not a pleasant reflection perhaps, to be drawn from them, namely, that to compete successfully with clandestine prosti- tution the registration lists should be renewed more frequently. As matters stand the same names are in some instances to be found on them for as long as twenty years. The owners of these names have doubtless acquired some valuable charac- teristics; they have for instance attained to a complete immunity from dis- order themselves and cannot possibly prove, in consequence, a source of it to others; but they have lost most likely attractions which the soldier views in a higher light than these acquirements, albeit in no way indifferent to the intrinsic value of them, and so he directs his steps to the residence of some clandestine rival, who pleases his fancy better. In conclusion I regret to say that nothing in the year 1886 points to any solution of the great problem how to guard troops against syphilis. The Act which aims at this end is one which is so full of defects and so difficult of appli- cation that the time seems still remote when a full measure of success can be obtained from it. Over a small area and in a purely military cantonment remote from the immediate vicinity of a large. town where troops ought never to be quartered it might be quite possible to carry out the Act thoroughly. But under the ordinary conditions of military stations the requisite machinery and the ne- cessary unfettered authority is not to be hoped for, and hence the main source of the unsatisfactory results of the lock-hospital system in the Burma Division for the year 1886.
