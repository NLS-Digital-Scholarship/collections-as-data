REPORT ON VACCINATION FOR THE PROVINCE OF OUDH, 1873.
No. 3971. FROM THE OFFG. SECY. TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, OUDH, Lucknow, To G. S. SUTHERLAND, ESQ., SUPERINTENDENT OF VACCINATION, OUDH, LUCKNOW. Dated Lucknow, the 14th July 1874. SIR, GENL. DEPARTMENT. I AM directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1675, dated the 6th June, submitting your Annual Report on Vaccination in the Province of Oudh, for the year 1873-74. 2. Owing to the supply of vaccine material from England not arriving in proper time, vaccine operations were delayed at the commencement of the season. But, notwithstanding this misfortune, the number of vaccinations increased from 19,170 to 30,409. The number of infants vaccinated rose from 4,669 to 10,680. 3. The Chief Commissioner observes that all efforts to cultivate the virus from the crusts of the previous season were unsuccessful; and that for material wherewith to commence the operations of the season you were indebted to the Superintendent General of Vaccination, North-Western Provinces. 4. The illness of the Deputy Superintendent during the vaccination season was unfortunate. 5. Notwithstanding the remarks of the Deputy Commissioner of Gonda, referred to in para. 3 of your report, it appears that 469 children were vaccinated in that district; Sir George Couper trusts that they were not all operated on against the wishes of their parents. Para. 6. 6. Cases of re-vaccination fell from 452 to 172. The number of successful cases recorded at Lucknow seems too good to be true. 7. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator has risen from 355 to 553. 8. There is no dispensary vaccination in Oudh, and I am to suggest for your consideration, whether it would not be useful to supply the Hospital Assistants in charge of branch dispensaries with lymph. All these men are, the Chief Commissioner apprehends, quite capable of performing the operation, and to some of them people would possibly bring their children to be vaccinated. At Sundila there is a dispensary, and the Chief Commissioner has heard that some native gentlemen have expressed regret that, no one is vaccinated there.
( 2 ) 9. The Chief Commissioner is glad that you were, on the whole, satisfied with the working of the establishment, and I am to express his congratulations on the marked improvement which the results of the past show on those of the preceding year. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, H. J. SPARKS, Offg. Secy. to the Chief Commr., Oudh.
Report on Vaccination in the Province of Oudh for the year 1873-74. STATEMENT No. I. Numbers vaccinated. The staff of Vaccinators numbered one more than in the previous season and consisted with very few exceptions of the same individuals. The number of primary vaccinations increased from 18,718 to 30,237. The increase took place in all the districts with exception of Seetapoor and Hardui in which there was a decrease, for which I am unable to give any good reason. A very small part, if any, of the general increase is accounted for by the fact of the working season having been made a fortnight longer than usual. This was done to make up for time lost at the beginning in consequence of the supply of virus from England not arriving in proper time. The greater part of the increase was due to other causes, which cannot however be proved and regarding which mere opinions may not be of much value. Percentage of success. 2. The percentage of success fell from 81 to 80 per cent. ; which, though not a material difference, is not in the desired direction. The supply of vaccine material from England arrived late. Efforts were made to cultivate the virus from crusts of the previous season, but these, without exception, failed. These attempts are however duly recorded as unsuccessful operations and have lowered the percentage of success of the season. The first crop of vesicles, through which the process of vaccina- tion was set on foot before the English supply arrived, sprang from material obtained from the Superintendent General of Vaccination of the North-Western Provinces. Average operations per man per diem. 3. The average number of operations done by each Vaccinator, during the season of 5½ months was 553 or nearly 4 per diem. The maximum number recorded was 970 and minimum 265. The worst averages were made in the districts of Lucknow and Gonda, and the best in those of Sultánpur and Bharaich. The bad results at Lucknow may be in part explained by the absence of the Deputy Superintendent on sick leave during 3 months of the vaccinating season; his special duty at this time being to supervise the work of the most inexperienced hands who are kept at Lucknow. The people of Gonda are very superstitious and much opposed to vaccination. The Deputy Commissioner remarks in forwarding the Sanitary Report that they will not voluntarily have their children vaccinated. Age of persons vaccinated 4. There has been an improvement in the ratio of infants vacci- nated which has risen from ¼ to ( 2 ) Success of revaccination. 6. As regards the success of secondary vaccination, there appears to be still some misunderstanding, as it cannot nearly equal that of primary operations. But Vaccinators are little apt, if they get any results, to make fine distinctions ; and rather incline to give success the benefit of any doubt as to the character of a vesicle. 114 of a total of 130 successful revaccinations were recorded at Lucknow. STATEMENT No. II. Work compared by months in quantity. 7. The vaccinations, comparatively few in October, doubled in num- ber in November and again in December, attained a maximum in January, declined somewhat in February and still more in the first half of March. The early part of this history is explained by the scarcity of vaccine already mentioned; and towards the end of the season Hindu festivals and marriage ceremonies begin to interfere with regular work. In ratio of success. 8. But for the bad results in October already explained, for which the operators are not to blame. the percentage of success in 1873-74 would have been greater than in any of the three previous seasons. STATEMENT No. III. 9. Vaccination is not supported to any extent by the Municipalities in Oudh. The available funds of most of these bodies are required to meet more urgent demands upon their income. STATEMENT No. IV. Cost of each successful case. 10. The cost of each successful vaccination was Rs. 0-5-2,( 3 ) Vaccination Establishment. Grade. Remained at the end of previous season.

The above Table gives a numerical account of the changes in Establishment during the season. Of seven dismissals, six were the result of doing too little work after having been duly warned that a minimum would be required. The seventh followed an attempt to vaccinate the inhabitants of the Lucknow Cantonment bazar against their will. On the whole however the Establishment behaved well and worked well. The Deputy Superintendent, Assistant Surgeon Parbutty Churn Ghose, was unfortunately compelled by a severe illness to be absent for a considerable part of the working season as already noticed. G. S.
