BENGAL JAIL DIETARIES With some observations on the Influence of Dietary on the Physical Development and Well-being of the People of Bengal. INTRODUCTION. THE investigations that have been engaging the attention of the staff * of the Physiological Department of the Medical College, Calcutta, have, we hope, shed a considerable amount of light on the nutritive value of Indian food-stuffs, and particularly on the nutritive value of jail dietaries in Bengal. They will also be found to have a very distinct bearing on the much discussed problems of nutrition. The work recorded in this memoir has been carried out on the initiative and at the expense of the Sanitary Department of the Government of India. The im- portance of the subject of jail dietaries had been fully recognised by the Govern- ment of India. They had already caused certain enquiries to be made, which will be referred to, but had deferred further action until a suitable officer became available for the purpose of estimating the nutritive value of the different food- stuffs in the dietary of prisoners. The present enquiry is limited to the jails of Bengal. The Work began on the 1st February 1908 and has been going on practically continuously (so far as other official duties permitted) for the last eighteen months.. Historical. It would not serve any useful purpose to go very deeply into the history of all the work that has been done on jail diets at Home and in India. Certain important papers will be referred to in so far as they are of interest in the light of present investigations; but all the work hitherto done has been based on the assumption that the chemical analysis of food-stuffs afforded a direct measure of their nutritive value. Further, the diet scales laid down for Indian prisons have all been calculated on the result of chemical analyses and not on the actual nutritive value of the food materials, i.e., the percentage of their proximate principles that is capable of being absorbed by the intestinal tract of the prisoners * Three Assistant Surgeons were employed on the enquiry, viz.:2 The present enquiry aims at estimations of the actual amount of some of the proximate principles3 be very properly analysed the diet on which this was possible, and found it to con- tain quantities of nitrogen and carbon which (when allowance is made for difference in weight) were practically identical with Letheby's estimate for ordinary labour in England, and of the same value as the hard labour diet of English convicts. On the basis of this experience his three scales of diet were formulated :4 The next paper to which we wish to refer is Surgeon-Major T. B. Lewis's Memo- randum * on the Dietaries of Labouring Prisoners in Indian Jails. This is a most important and comprehensive discussion of the whole subject of Indian jail diet- aries. Dr.Lewis evidently clearly foresaw the importance of the absorbability of a diet, for in discussing the nutritive value of the diet scales of labouring prisoners he says: " There are practical difficulties in deciding the equivalent values of these various food-stuffs, not only because the chemical analyses which have been made of many of them are not so complete as desirable, but there is also a want of definite knowledge as to their exact position as true aliments based on their adaptability for being assimilated." This valuable memorandum traces the history of the different scales of diet for Indian prisons and gives their values in the principal alimentary constituents. Thus the Government of Bengal in 1860 adopted certain scales on the recom- mendation of Dr. Mouat. The interesting point regarding these diets for labouring and under-trial prisoners is that animal food was included. These diets appear to have been in force in Lower Bengal for eighteen years. Their chief constituents are worth recording :5 In 1877 another Jail Conference was assembled in Calcutta when it was found that such diversities existed as to the quantities and nature of the food given in different jails that it was deemed expedient to make an attempt to introduce a new scale of dietary. Excluding the recommendations regarding vegetables, fats, salt, etc., the following scale was laid down as a maximum for adult male prisoners sentenced to hard labonr. 26 ounces (including 4 ozs. pulse) of sifted flour, and 28 ozs. of grain in the case of wheat, rice or barley. Whenever it may be considered necessary 4 ozs.of meat or fish, or an equi- valent of milk, may be given instead of 4 ozs.of grain. As Dr. Lewis points out, the principal difference between these diets and those recommended by the 1864 Committee consists in the adoption of the principle that the issue of animal food should be left to the discretion of the local jail authorities, instead of making it a compulsory article of the labouring and under-trial dietary. On the whole there is practically but little difference between the recommenda- tion of the Committee of 1864 and of the Conference of 1877 so far as the ultimate chemical constituents of the dietaries are concerned; but a pound of animal food per week constituted part of the regular food approved by the former, whereas the latter left the issue of this article to the discretion of the local authorities. The Conference, however, increased the rice ration by four ounces daily when meat was not given, and the vegetables were increased by two ounces per diem. Lewis says that in March 1879 the Bengali and Behari prisoners were placed on the diet proposed by the Conference and he continues thus: " During this year the health returns of the prisoners in Bengal were exceptionally unfavourable; and as the period during which the new dietary was in force coincided with the period of maximum mortality, it was concluded that the high sickness and mortality in this particular province was attributable to insufficient food. In consequence of this inference extra rations were issued from March 1880 to July 1881 when completely new scales of diets were introduced with the sanction of the Local Government." In July 1881 the dietary scale introduced for Lower Bengal was :6 The scales for Bengalis and Beharis were alike, with the exception that the staple cereal in the dietary of the Behari consisted of a mixture of 12 ozs. rice and 10 ozs. wheat flour or a similar mixture of rice and maize. Lewis remarks on these diets that," taken as a whole, the nutritive value of this dietary not only exceeds, under every heading, the ' adapted ' scale, which has been prepared from English Local Prison scales, but, in most cases the amount of food actually issued is more than is given as a maximum dietary in either the convict or the Local Prisons in England and Wales. Computed on the English standard these scales should suffice for men weighing considerably more than the average weight of natives of Bengal and of Behar 7 food-stuff contains that is of moment, but also what portion of it can be readily digested and assimilated by the body. He adds that it is very doubtful whether the increase in the nitrogenous elements by raising the proportion of the pulses8 So that to have estimated the amounts of protein, carbohydrate and fat in a satisfactory European diet and then, by calculations based on the chemical analyses of Indian food materials, to work out the combinations of those food-stuffs that will provide the identical amounts of protein, carbohydrate and fat, will give us a diet that, by chemical analysis, is identical as regards the quantities of alimentary principles present, but one from which a very dissimilar amount of nutritive material is capable of being absorbed. As we have already said9 to detract from the value of their researches for which nothing but admiration is, possible. No work had been done in their time on the actual nutritive value of Indian food materials, i.e., the amount actually absorbed from the dietaries10 common to the diets of both countries, and perhaps also with a people who have a low power of absorption as compared with Europeans, that we consider that any adaptation based on European experience is misleading and incorrect. To much of the valuable information contained in Major Macnamara's paper we shall have occasion to refer when dealing with other parts of the enquiry, at present all that we need say is that, until the Punjab jail diets have been studied from the standpoint of their actual nutritive value, it is impossible to form any opinion as to their superiority or otherwise, compared with Major Macnamara's adaptations based on the Scotch dietaries. With regard to the remarks of Lieutenant-Colonel C. J. Bamber, I.M.S., Sani- tary Commissioner, Punjab, we cannot do better than quote his closing paragraph: " In conclusion, I think it will be advisable before making any alteration in the diet scales of the Province to appoint a Committee to consider the diets of the people of the different districts of the province, to carry out experiments on the chemical composition and digestibility of the different food grains in use in this Province, and then, having fixed upon suitable diet scales, to try them first in one or two jails in this Province." The last of the official papers connected with this subject is the correspondence relating to the dietary in force in the Andamans. We shall have occasion to make use of the experience gained as to the suitability of the diet scales in force in that Settlement when we come to consider the proper proportions of the different food- stuffs constituting satisfactory diets. The Scope of the Present Enquiry. The following extract from a letter from the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India to the Government of Bengal gives an outline of the work required to be carried out:11 (6) The effects of the large amount of carbohydrate on nutrition and on intestinal disorders. (7) The effects of the large quantity of salt which is at present given to prisoners." As will be evident a pretty extensive programme was outlined for our guidance in the investigations. Some of the points we have been barely able to touch on, while others have been very thoroughly enquired into. The estimation of the nutritive value of the dietaries has turned out to involve a very great deal of work and has taken up at least 90 per cent. of the time that could be allotted to the enquiry from official duties. This part of the work is by far the most important and of the greatest interest. So far as India is concerned it is entirely new12 Without going into detail of the investigations carried out on absorption in these countries we may say with Hutchison that, "taking the general results of all experiments, it is calculated that the following proportions of the nutritive constituents will be absorbed from a mixed diet "*:13 materials can be arrived at so far as Indian jail dietaries are concerned. The percentage of the protein absorption of the whole diets14 we were able, by using Bryant and Milner's method, to get figures for the co- efficient of protein absorption that were at all comparable with those of Rubner, Atwater, etc. We found that for different quantities of the food-stuff in the diets. examined different proportions of their contained protein were absorbed, and that, instead of finding a figure that represented the percentage of protein absorbed for varying amounts of rice, wheat, dal, etc., for each separate quantity of rice, wheat, dal, etc., above a certain amount, a different percentage of its contained protein would be absorbed. This is a very different result from what would appear to be the case from the work of investigators in Europe and America; but it is covered by a simple explanation. If we assume that 85 per cent. is the maximum of protein absorption possible on a diet of cereals and legumes, then, under ordi- nary physiological conditions, that 85 per cent. will be absorbed; this is what takes. place in the class of diets in which investigations on the co-efficient of protein absorption have been carried out in America and Europe15 evident, assuming as before that 85 per cent. of the protein of rice is absorbed so long as the quantity of rice does not exceed a certain amount, that if we increase the quantity of rice beyond this amount, even if a smaller percentage of the protein is absorbed, the now greater quantity of protein from the increased amount of rice multiplied by a slightly diminished co-efficient of absorption will give an actually greater quantity of protein undergoing metabolism in the body. This will hold true up to a certain limit and when this is passed, the actual amount of protein undergoing metabolism will diminish instead of increasing as more and more rice is added to the diet. An illustration will make this line of reasoning clear:16 Thus for wheat ata in the Behar diet we had to arrange for a series of diets on the following plan:17 At present it will be sufficient to point out that abundant experimental evi- dence has accumulated to show that the nutritive values of the fats and carbo- hydrates of food are almost proportional to the amount of energy that they can fur- nish; consequently it is only important that the quantity of either or both be such that their total energy, when added to that of the protein of the diet, shall supply the amount required by the body. The maximum amount of energy that can be obtained by the body is not the total potential energy of the food con- sumed, since the potential energy of the corresponding fæces must be deducted. Furthermore, the body is not capable of completely oxidising the absorbed protein, the incompletely oxidised products being excreted in. the urine, and the energy eliminated in this way must also be deducted. The net or actual energy-value to the body is the total potential energy of the food minus that of the corresponding fæces and urine.* In dealing, however, with the vegetarian dietaries in force in Indian jails another factor has to be considered with regard to the energy or fuel value of a diet; this factor is the excessive fermentative processes in the digestive tract. Anyone who has experience of the effects of excessive carbohydrates in the diet will readily recognise the clinical features of excessive intestinal fermentation in the noisy eructations, flatulency, tendency to diarrh18 the food will be readily admitted; and it, therefore, introduces a fallacy into any determinations of the energy requirements by the respiration calorimeter under conditions of excessive fermentation. No work has been done in India on the determination of the energy require- ments of Indians of different size, age, sex and degrees of bodily activity. Accept- ing that the law of the conservation of energy obtains in the human organism, such work will require the determination of the energy-output per day in terms of the total heat-output by means of the respiration calorimeter. Any calculation of the heat-value obtained from the food that is based on the number of heat units furnished by that food must, therefore, take into account the loss in the urine and fæces, and the loss incidental to fermentation in the gastro-intestinal tract. We have no observations on the total loss of heat in the urine and fæces of prisoners on any of the diets investigated and, as stated above, there is no means of deter- mining the loss due to fermentation. We are, however, able to present the energy values of the different food-stuffs in use in the jails of Bengal determined by means of the calorimetric bomb. For these results we are indebted to the kindness of Professor Benedict of the Carne- gie Institute of Washington, Boston, who, on hearing of these investigations, at once offered assistance in the determination of the energy values of the food- stuffs. To Professor Benedict we desire to express our thanks for the kindly interest he has taken in the enquiry and for the help he has rendered us. We shall conclude what we have to say regarding the scope of the present enquiry by giving a short, concise Account of the work done. 1. All the different food-stuffs in use in the dietaries of Bengal and Behar jails have been analysed. As will be seen from the tables of analyses this involved a good deal of labour; but in addition to these, which were all carried out at the beginning of the investigation before work on nutritive value was commenced, we almost invariably analysed the different food materials entering into the composition of the dietaries whose nutritive value was being examined. This was found necessary in order to obtain an accurate estimate of the total protein intake; the nutritive investigations being carried out during both the wet and the dry seasons of the year differences in the percentage of moisture caused considerable variations in the percentages of the different proximate principles. This part of the work entailed about19 In all 60 different samples of food-stuffs, obtained from seven different jails in Bengal, were analysed. 2. Investigations were carried out in the following Bengal Jails:20 Ranchi Jail. 16 prisoners under observation for 14 days. Darjeeling Jail. 13 prisoners under observation for 12 days. 12 " " " " 12 " 12 " " " " 10 " In the work of investigating the nutritive value of Bengal Jail, dietaries we have had over 250 prisoners under observation for 350 days. During this time these prisoners were actually fed by us on a known diet, and their excreta collected for analysis. 4.Chemical analyses21 machine (which was not available in the different jails), no great amount of attention was given to this part of the work on prisoners; a certain number of observations were, however, carried out in the Physiological Laboratory on the menial staff and on animals. Methods of work. 6. A short account of our methods is necessary in order to give some indication of the extent of the investigations; and at the same time it will obviate any repetitions in the account furnished of our results. I. Analyses of Food-stuffs and Excreta.22 often required different times for complete distillation of the ammonia. To state that the distillation should go on until a certain quantity of fluid had passed over23 The Carbohydrate of the food-stuffs analysed was estimated by completely changing all the carbohydrate material into sugar by the action of hydrochloric acid, and then estimating the per- centage of sugar by Fehling's method, checking the results by the Pavy-Fehling method or the Picro-Saccharometer. The Fat was estimated in the usual way by means of a slightly modified Soxhlet apparatus manufactured to our drawings by Messrs. Baird and Tatlock, London. The moisture and ash require no comment. II. The method of procedure when we came to investigations on prisoners was almost invariably to use as our unit a batch of five picked prisoners24 At every change of diet the same routine was observed, i.e., the prisoners were kept on the diet two or more days before collec- tion of their excreta for analyses. III. The feeding of the prisoners was carried out on the following plan:25 In the Presidency Jail, Calcutta, Midnapore Jail and Puri Jail we estimated the total nitrogen of both urine and fæces. In the remaining jail we decided to rely on the total nitrogen of the urine for our results. Our reasons for so doing were that we found a good deal of difficulty in separating the fæces corresponding to the diet given, owing to the fluid character of the stools. It was also very difficult to deal with the large volume of fæces passed by the prisoners, and the unpleasant nature of the work was a serious source of objection to its being properly performed. Our main reason, however, for giving up the fæces estimations and relying on the urine26 We have now traced the history of Bengal Jail dietaries as recorded in the excellent papers cited, and indicated the different factors that led up to the pre- sent investigation. We have given in brief outline an account of the scope of the present enquiry with some discussion on the difficulties to be overcome, and an indication of the way in which we have attempted to arrive at the nutritive value of jail dietaries and their modifications. We have discussed what the real value of a diet consists in, viz., the amount of nitrogen it presents that is capable of absorption and assimilation, and the amount of energy it is able to furnish (deducting that lost to the body in the urine and fæces, and the important loss from excessive gastro-intestinal fermentation). We have given a short résumé of the present investigations carried out on the different races of people examined in the several jails of the province, with a description of ou methods of work. Nothing now remains but to give an account of the results obtained with the conclusions at which we have arrived. In doing so we shall approach the sub- ject as "independent enquirers seeking the truth unconcerned where the evidence may lead us, and shall endeavour to put all aspects of the question that come before us in an equally strong light." Before proceeding to do this it is our pleasing duty to tender our best thanks for the kindness shown us, the interest taken in the work, and the able assistance in its fulfilment, invariably given us by those officers of the Jail Department in Bengal, with whom we have come in contact during the investigations. The Inspector-General of Jails, Lieutenant-Colonel W. J. Buchanan, I.M.S., has earned our best thanks for smoothing the path and giving us a free hand to make use of the jails as we found necessary.

The food materials in use in the Bengal Jail dietaries are all derived from the vegetable kingdom; so that, for the time during which they are under confinement, the prisoners are strict vegetarians. No animal food of any kind enters into their dietaries, except in hospital and in certain circumstances which will be referred to. These food materials consist of rice, different dals and vegetables in Lower Bengal, and rice, wheat ata or makkai ata (maize), different dals (pulses) and vege- tables in Behar. The rice in use is of two kinds28 Rice is the poorest of all cereals in protein; when cooked it swells up and absorbs about three and a half times its weight of water, some of its mineral constituents being dissolved and lost when the boiled rice is strained. Very little of the protein is removed when rice is boiled in a large quantity of water and the ex- cess of water drained off29 and the proportion of contained cellulose scanty, digestion is very complete and that under contrary conditions, low absorption is to be expected. Unfortunately the dietaries of Bengal jails are very bulky and contain a large amount of cellulose so that digestion and absorption is very imperfect: we have rarely found more than 55 per cent. of the protein of the ordinary jail diet absorbed when the full diet was consumed. This is in general agreement with the findings of other observers as the following table, compiled by Hutchison, shows:30 for a time, of non-satisfaction and hunger. This, however, soon passes off when a more nutritious diet is prescribed, the stomach returning to something, like its normal capacity and the feeling of emptiness disappearing. The wheat ata or flour of the diets for Behari prisoners is prepared from the whole grain by prison labour by means of small grinding stones. If a grain of wheat be cut and examined microscopically, the following parts can be made out:31 can be no doubt that the tough, tenacious "chuppatie" is less easily penetrated by the digestive juices than is the lighter, aërated bread of Europeans. When chuppaties are given in fairly large amount with large quantities of rice, dal and vegetables there is much waste, and our results show a percentage absorption of protein in the Beharis very little better than is found in prisoners in Lower Bengal where wheat forms no part of the diet. Of course the Behari dietaries contain a very much larger quantity of protein than Lower Bengal diets, so that the actual amount of protein undergoing metabolism per man daily is greater. Makkai32 The calculated heat value, therefore, gives the net amount available to the economy after absorption, while the determined heat value gives the gross amount available in the sample. It will be evident how very closely the figures obtained by the experimental method and by calculation correspond to each other when due allowance is made for the presence of non-digestible combustible material as cellulose, woody-fibre, chitinous coverings, etc., and for the difference in the percentage of moisture present in the samples analysed by us and those examined by Professor Benedict in America. We give the necessary information in a note appended to Table G, and, at the same time, we desire to express our best thanks for the valuable assistance Professor Benedict has given us and also for much kindly advice.

CHAPTER II. The Nutritive Value of Bengal Jail Dietaries. "We live not upon what we eat, but upon what we digest." The chief uses of food are:40 SECTION 2. Amount of nitrogen undergoing metabolism in the ordinary jail diet, in the case of 41 This is the ordinary diet scale in use for the great majority of the prisoners in both the large central jails and the district jails of Lower Bengal. Other scales are sanc- tioned in which the rice is diminished by 4 ozs., its place being taken by 3.4 ozs. of wheat ata or a like amount of Suttoo (fried gram dal ground to meal) but, so far as we are aware, the diet given above is the only one in general use. SECTION 1. 1. The Value of this Diet in Proximate Principles. TABLE I. Food-stuff. Rice. Dals. Vege- tables. Mustard Oil. Condi- ments. Anti- scorbu- tic. Total in Gram- mes.

The mean of the percentage composition of all the different dals is used in working out their value in proximate principles. Usually three or more dals are in use at the same time, being given in the diet alternately. We may, therefore, accept the figures given in Table I as representing the average value of the diets in use in the jails of Lower Bengal, Orissa and Chota Nagpur. The value from day to day varies slightly above and below these figures according to the particular dals issued in the diet and the vegetables in season. The apparent value of this diet. We might hark back to Lewis' article again and quote his remarks on this subject:42 or caloric value. Calculated according to the accepted heat equivalents its fuel value is 3,508 calories, which is higher than that of any of the standard diets that have been formulated for Europeans and over 1,000 calories higher than is furnished by Ranke's diet. As we shall have reason to see later, there are two great defects in this diet which lessen its nutritive value to a very serious extent, with the result that, while according to its chemical composition it seems to be superior to English Prison scales and even to some of the standard dietaries, it is really very much inferior. These defects are:43 to make use of the 3,500 calories of their dietary must either produce a large amount of heat44 harmful. While agreeing, therefore, with Lewis's opinion on the dietary we con- demn it for a totally different reason; whilst believing that the diet is excessive for prisoners of the body-weight of the Bengali, and agreeing that it offers more nitrogen and energy per kilo of body weight than that found necessary in English prisons, we condemn it because, on account of its bulk and composition, much less than the proper proportions of its nutrients can be absorbed and made use of in the system. We shall show, with regard to the most important element45 TABLE II.

A full report of the results will be found in its proper place; at present, all we wish to say is that even this rice-eating people, accus- tomed from infancy to the consumption of enormous quantities of rice, in a short time got used to the altered conditions and became quite contented with their new diets. The Ooriyas on the other hand are not as a rule very fond of dal, the amount of dal taken daily by the ordinary working population being very small, due largely to the expense of this food material. They are very fond of fish and all those near the coast and close to rivers obtain plenty of fish as a part of their dietary. Most of them, however, live on rice and vegetables as their staple diet. All we have said, therefore, with regard to the extreme bulkiness of this type of diet and the disabilities attached to it apply with even greater force in the case of the Ooriya than with the Bengali. The result is that the physical development of the Ooriya and his powers of resistance to disease are probably on even a lower scale than those of the average working population of Bengal, when those of both classes who are able to get enough to eat are compared. Let us see how the rice-eating Ooriya stands with regard to his power of absorbing protein from the ordinary jail diet. TABLE III.

It would not appear from these observa- tions that country rice has any advantage, so far as its nutritive value is concerned, over Burma rice although it is much preferred by the inhabitants of Bengal includ- ing Behar. In fact, so far as these observations touch the question, whatever difference exists is in favour of the Burma variety, that is when the full 26 ozs. are eaten. In these three sets of observations, the full amount of rice being always con- sumed, the intake of nitrogen from rice was constant; the intake of nitrogen from dal was also very nearly identical in each; thus, Basis of five men for five days.

(ii) Arhar dal 160.62 53 lead us to suspect that 6 ozs. of dal per man daily is beyond the amount from which the maximum absorption can take place. (iv) The results stated in (ii) and (iii) do not justify the assumption that with lesser amounts of rice and dal in the dietaries differences in the ab- sorbability of the protein of these food-stuffs would not take place; or that the absorption from Burma rice and country rice would be identical for different amounts of rice in the diet; or that, if the quantity of dal in the dietary were diminished, the same percentage absorption would occur from the decreased amounts of the several kinds of dal.

Thus, we showed in a summary of Table II that, with a practically constant intake of nitrogen from rice but with a varying intake of nitrogen derived from dal, no increase in nitrogenous metabolism accompanied an augmented nitrogen content of the diet from dal. The figures in support of this view on the basis of batches of five men under observation for five days are:67 were observed while on diets containing the same quantities of Burma rice, the amounts of dal in the different diets varying.

By a similar line of reasoning it may be accept- ed that in Diet III there is a decreased percentage absorption of the protein of rice and an increased percentage absorption of the protein of mung dal, even though less nitrogen is absorbed from the 4 ozs. of mung dal of Diet III than from the 6 ozs. of Diet I. As the amount of the nitrogen intake is practically identical in the three diets, and as very different amounts of nitrogen are absorbed in each case75 We have reason to believe that the top of the curve or maximum absorption. lies about 18 ozs. of rice per man daily;76 or dal as the case may be. The results obtained were very much what we expect- ed. As soon as any of these substances were substituted for rice the percentage of protein absorption showed a sudden rise and the actual protein metabolism became largely increased. As it would not serve any useful purpose to give in full detail all the different experiments carried out, and as all that is to be learned from them can be shown in a few examples, we shall content ourselves by stating as concisely as possible the results of the observations. We shall take up this part of the work under two heads77 These results should be contrasted with those given in Table III (ii) and (iii):78 Total intake79 Total intake80 of the nitrogen of the diet was absorbed which meant 8.00 grms. per man daily.

Thus on a diet consisting of83 The following series of results bring out these points very clearly :84 (ii) Substitution of nitrogen, derived from goat's flesh and fish, in quantities considerably less than sufficient to make up for the diminution in the nitrogen due to decreasing the rice of the ordinary diet by a half85 (i) and (ii) contrasted :86 BATCH.

Whatever the true explanation may be there is no doubt that when the rice of the diet is ex- cessive in amount, the addition of an animal protein has not the same relative effect in increasing nitrogenous metabolism as when the quantity of rice is low. Now this cannot be due to the excessive carbohydrate element, when the quantity of rice is large, sparing protein, because we find exactly the same results when the carbohydrates are kept constant; and we have good reason to suppose that when the carbohydrate element of a diet is such as supplied by the ordinary Bengal jail standard, a very large part of it is never made use of in the body, but is either broken down by fermentation or passed out unchanged. The influence of the bulkiness of a diet on the apparent amount of nitrogen absorbed from an animal protein is clearly brought out in the following investiga- tions:88 which would apparently mean that 13.04 grms. of nitrogen given in fish increases the nitrogenous metabolism by 10.12 grms. This would be an absorption of 77.6 per cent. of the protein of fish; but we have already seen from investigations (iii) and (iv) of this Table, that 96.8 per cent. of the nitrogen of fish is absorbed when the rice is reduced to 13 ozs. per man daily; there must, therefore, be some influence at work to cause this great variation. It cannot be a difference in the carbohydrate element as this is identi- cal in the two diets contrasted in (v); so that by exclusion it can only be the difference in the bulkiness of the diet in (iii) and (iv)89 which means the absorption of 96.8 per cent. of the nitrogen of fish. Nitrogen undergoing metabolism. Grms. Rice 20 ozs. + (90 Total intake91 Thus in a diet almost exactly similar but containing no goat's flesh or fish we find a nitrogenous metabolism of 9.51 grms. daily; whereas the addition of 2 grammes of nitrogen from fish or 2.1 grms. of nitrogen from goat's flesh only increases the nitrogenous metabolism by 0.71 and 0.58 grm. per man daily.

The carbohydrate element offered even by this reduced scale is more than sufficient to meet the daily requirements, for fuel to maintain body heat and as a source for the energy of muscular contraction. Further, it is superior to the diet available to the great bulk of the population of lower Bengal, and fulfils the conditions laid down by Major Macnamara, I.M.S.,* "the public obligations towards a prisoner are fully discharged as regards food, when he is given a sufficiency to maintain him in health, though this amount does not necessarily satisfy his craving or capacity." If, therefore, it is considered advisable to limit the jail dietaries to the food materials rice and dal, we strongly recommend a reduction to at most 20 ozs. of rice with 5 ozs. of dal or 18 ozs. of rice with 6 ozs. of dal. From the results of the investigations recorded in section (4) it would seem advisable to consider the question of the addition of wheat ata or an animal pro- tein to the lower Bengal scales. While it would not appear to be absolutely neces- sary to add either of these food materials, the fact that, by giving a very small amount of one of these more easily assimilable forms of protein, we can place the nitrogenous metabolism of the prisoner on a higher scale, and, therefore, in all pro- bability increase his power of resistance to disease, must be looked on as so much gain96 Results extracted from Table VII and VIII97 We have placed all the prisoners in Puri jail on diets somewhat similar to these for a period of about six months; a report of the effects of the change, with observations on the degree of nitrogenous metabolism, the health of the prisoners, the effect on body weight, etc., will be found in its proper place. We do not con- sider that an animal protein is at all essential in the dietaries of a practically purely vegetarian people, and, therefore, would only recommend a change to fish from an economical standpoint; mutton, goat's flesh, etc., are not required. While we do not consider that an animal protein is necessary there is no doubt that the addition of even a small quantity appears to have a marked influ- ence in assisting the absorption of protein from a diet of the Lower Bengal type. We obtained evidence of this in some work carried out in Midnapore jail. The custom in that jail is to give what is termed " fish relish "98 0.2 grms. nitrogen daily, we bring the nitrogenous metabolism up to 8.85 grms. per man daily. When this result was contrasted with the average 7.55 grms. of nitrogen found for the absorption on the full jail diet, it appeared possible that the addition of a small quantity of fish had exerted a very decided influence in assisting the absorption of protein from the jail dietary. As the quantity of nitrogen per man daily derived from fish was only 0.4 grms., and as it seemed to increase the pro- tein absorption from the diet by more than this amount, it was at first thought pro- bable that the animal protein had caused an increase in protein absorption greater than could be accounted for in the amount of nitrogen furnished by the fish. But, while not denying that an animal protein may by its presence exert a favour- able influence on the absorption of vegetable protein, these results are open to a simpler explanation. If the diet consumed by the prisoners be examined we find that instead of the whole 26 ozs. being eaten, only99 suggested. Granting that we are correct in assuming that the prisoner, on the- average, lives on 7.55 grms. of nitrogen per day and that he remains healthy and even puts on flesh on this amount, there is no urgent necessity to increase his nitro- genous metabolism. But, when we find that the quantities of the component parts of the diets are so great that they are beyond the amounts from which the best absorption can take place, we have a very strong indication for the reduction of those quantities to something approaching proper limits. Those limits we have tried to lay down, and we believe that we have succeeded in defining them. We find 18 ozs. of rice per man daily to be the amount from which a maxi- mum absorption takes place; we believe that it will be to the advantage of the prisoners to reduce the dal to 4 ozs. per man daily and substitute for the 2 ozs dal cut off, 4 ozs. of wheat ata100 protein absorption is not constant, but varies with the quantities of the food mate- rials forming the dietunder investigation. We therefore arranged different series of observations in which, when all but one of the constituents of the diet were con- stant, the actual material under investigation was made to vary. By this means we were able to discover with what particular amount of rice, dal, or ata the pro- tein absorption was at a maximum, and were able to plot out the curves thus ob- tained so as to show at a glance the effects of the varying quantities of the different food materials. When we came to a study of the Behari diets we fully expected to find a very much larger percentage absorption of protein than in the Bengali ; such, however, was not the case: the protein absorption from the full diet of Behar jails is only very slightly higher than for Bengal jails. The actual amount of nitrogen undergoing metabolism was, however, on a much higher level. Again the reason for this poor percentage of protein absorption was not difficult to find: it was to be attributed to the same factors that were in force in the case of the full Bengal jail diets, viz., the vegetable food materials were in quantities greater than the digestive juices were able to deal with to the best advantage. Again we found that by reducing some of the elements an increased relative and actual absorption took place; it was, therefore, our aim to discover with what particular combinations of quantities of these food-stuffs the best absorption was possible. Having worked out this, we at once obtain that combination which leaves the smallest residue for intestinal putrefaction and fermentation, and from which waste is at a minimum. This would, therefore, also be the combination most economical to the State in the dieting of the criminals of Behar. SECTION 1. 1. The Value of the Behari Diet in Proximate Principles. As in the case of Bengal jails we give the average values: certain differences will arise according to the samples of wheat or dal in use. The values given below are based on the analyses of the food-stuffs that were in use in the Behar jails at the time the investigations were carried out :101 MAKKAI DIET. PROXIMATE PRINCIPLES. Rice.

Comparison with the diet of Lower Bengal will show the higher value in both protein and fat with very little difference in the carbohydrate. We need not again refer to the seemingly very high value of these diets as compared with those in force in convict prisons in England; all we have had to say in discussing the diet- aries of Lower Bengal applies with even greater force with regard to the diets of Behar. The difference between these two types of dietaries is due to the substi- tution of 10 ozs. of wheat ata or 12 ozs. of makkai ata (maize or Indian corn) for 10 ozs. of rice. While the reduction in the quantity of rice means a great lessening in the absolute bulkiness of the diet, our investigations show that the decrease is not sufficient to permit of the best use being made of its protein element. Fur- ther, the excessive carbohydrate element is again very conspicuous102 placed on a high plane of nitrogenous metabolism which, as we have good reason to believe, would tend to increase their general physique and power of resisting infection and, at the same time, leave merely the normal quantity of residual waste: but, instead of this, with a protein absorption of little over 50 per cent. the prisoners are placed on a low level of nitrogenous metabolism, their physique, nutrition and power of resisting infection are lessened and, at the same time, their liability to auto-infection and auto-intoxication is increased by the presence of a splendid culture medium for micro-organismal growth within the body derived from the 50 per cent. residue of the jail diet. Another point not to be lost sight of is the avoidable waste of food. materials, with its consequent expense to the State. Our objection to these dietaries therefore is not that the diet offered is excessive and thus entails a high level of nitrogenous metabolism, but that on account of its peculiar composition and of the large quantities of the food materials entering into that composition, the absorption from it is lower than it should be. Along with Lewis, Macnamara and all others who have made a study of the subject, we would decrease the quantities of the food-stuffs; but, in. contradis- tinction to other observers, we would do so not because the diet gives too high a level of nitrogenous metabolism but in order to raise the level of nitrogenous metabolism and afford the digestive juices an opportunity of carrying on their work in a physiological manner. We now pass to a review of the investigations carried out in Buxar and Bhagalpur jails on the prisoners of Behar. SECTION 2. 2. The Amount of Nitrogen undergoing Metabolism on the Ordinary Jail Diet of Behar. We attempted to obtain the average amount of protein absorption from the full Behari dietaries in Buxar jail and Bhagalpur jail. In Buxar jail Burma rice is used, and here we experienced the same difficulty as encountered in the Presidency Jail, Calcutta, where Burma rice was also in use: it was found absolutely impossible to get the full ration of Burma rice consumed for a sufficient number of days to obtain reliable results. In fact, in all the different observations made we never once got the full 16 ozs. of Burma rice eaten. On the other hand, in Bhagalpur jail, where country rice is in use we had no difficulty in having the full diet eaten103 TABLE X.

Of the 80 ozs. of Burma rice offered in the diet on an average only 57 ozs. were eaten. The different dals in use were gram dal, arhar dal and massur dal. Points brought out in these investigations :105 Batch II106 Therefore we may conclude that the amount of nitrogenous metabolism from a diet composed of107 The average consumption of rice of these 20 men observed for seven consecu- tive days works out as 12.86 ozs. instead of the 16 ozs. provided in their daily diet. Even this was probably a higher consumption than normal, for we were anxious at this stage to get the prisoners to eat all the food provided, in order to obtain the average amount of protein absorbed from the full diet, so that the men were pressed to eat more than they really felt they needed. Further evidence that 16 ozs. per man daily of Burma rice is too great a quantity is afforded by the amounts found to be consumed by different batches during the two months that the investigations were going on in Buxar jail. Thus108 Bhagalpur Jail. Beharis. (ii) Country rice.109 diet was absorbed or only 8.76 grms. nitrogen per man daily. This would appear to support the view that prisoners who are given a free choice as regards the quantity of rice they may eat110 In Bhagalpur jail we had111 (c) A third and more indefinite factor was the unhealthy condition of Buxar jail at the time when we began our observations. The general health and tone of the jail improved very much later and, as will be seen in the subsequent results, a much better protein absorption was obtained from diets very similar in composition, the only difference being the substitution in them of mung dal for the different dals in use in the first series of observations. (b) The amount of nitrogen undergoing metabolism by prisoners derived from the hill tribes of Darjeeling on diets of the Behari type. As we, shall have to deal with hill men separately there is nothing to be gained by taking up this part of the subject now. Suffice it to say that on the whole they absorbed slightly more than Beharis from the same diet. The diet given in the Darjeeling jail is not by any means composed of the kinds of food materials that hill men are accustomed to. It is of a very inferior type and this jail served as the only example112 (a) Buxar Jail.

Under this section we pointed out that it was impossible to get the full ration of Burma rice consumed; and that, when left to themselves, prisoners will eat about 12 ozs. of Burma rice per day in combination with 10 ozs. of wheat ata, 6 ozs. of dal and 6 ozs. of vegetables. In section (III) we showed that this combination was an optimum, i.e., that from which a maximum protein absorption takes place. Having found that 12 ozs. per day was the optimum amount of Burma rice, we made use of this as a constant, and worked out the effects of varying the amount of wheat ata in the diets. From the results obtained it would appear that a quan- tity of (about) 9 ozs. of wheat ata is the optimum amount, when given in combina- tion with 12 ozs. of Burma rice, 6 ozs. of dal and 6 ozs. of vegetables. We also showed that very similar results as regards nitrogenous meta- bolism were obtained when mung, arhar, mottar or gram dals were given in equal quantities, and that the greater percentage of nitrogen present in mung dal did not increase the amount of protein absorption. We now pass to the observations made on similar lines when makkai ata was substituted for wheat ata in the Behari diets. Makkai ata is given in the cold weather only; as it does not keep well, it is impossible to use it the whole year round. Reference to Table IX will show that the value of this diet in proximate principles, while practically the same as that of the wheat diet in protein, is superior in both carbohydrate and fat. It presents, therefore, all the defects of an entirely vegetable diet, with the further disadvantage that the makkai ata can not be baked into bread, and for this reason has to be given in thick hard masses of little or no cohesion. The absorption of protein from diets containing makkai is on the whole on a lower level than when wheat ata is made use of, but the percentage absorption does not differ very markedly.

There we had very little difficulty in getting the whole 16 ozs. of rice eaten, but we did experience a certain amount of trouble with the prisoners on makkai ata and rice, as the full diet of these substances is very bulky and was consumed with difficulty. As will be seen from the run of the figures of the nitrogenous metabolism ob- tained at Bhagalpur and Buxar, we again get a lower level of protein metabolism in Buxar, similar to that brought out by the curves of protein metabolism when the wheat ata diets were in use.

127 What do we learn from these investigations ? Diet I. Total intake of N. =397.00 grms. Total output128 quantity laid down in the jail code, i.e., 12 ozs. per man daily is about the maxi- mum quantity that the average prisoner is capable of consuming; and that, while an increase in this amount does seem to be accompanied by a slight increase in the amount of protein absorbed, the fact that the prisoners cannot consume more than 12 ozs. per day puts any idea of increasing the quantity of makkai ata out of court. We may now add to our summary the results of these observations, viz., when makkai ata is substituted for wheat ata in the Behari type of diet. The general effect of the substitution of 10 ozs. of makkai ata for the same amount of wheat ata is to place the plane of nitrogenous metabolism of the pri- soners on a distinctly lower level. On the average for varying quantities of Burma rice the lowering of the level of nitrogenous metabolism works out at 1.66 grms. of nitrogen per man daily. This is very clearly brought out by comparing the curves of the two series of investigations129 Diet I. Behari prisoners observed over five consecutive days on each diet. BATCH A. Quantity of urine.

Diet I. Total intake131 Diet III. First week. Total intake132 From the results obtained we get the following:133 From these results it is at once obvious that:134 Diet IV. Nitrogen of "constant" + nitrogen from 10 ozs. rice gives 9.86 grms. N. metabolism, Diet V. Nitrogen of "constant" + nitrogen from 8 ozs. rice gives 9.78 grms. N. metabolism. Therefore, if the amount of nitrogen absorbed from the constant with vary- ing quantities of rice were always the same we should have 0.63 grms. of nitrogen giving an increased absorption of only 0.08 grms. of nitrogen which is absurd. The explanation is that in Diet V a greater percentage of the nitrogen of both "constant" and the 8 ozs. of rice is absorbed than in Diet IV. Taking the diets where the amount of rice is beyond the optimum the reverse conditions obtain. As the rice is increased in quantity a lower and lower percent- age of protein absorption takes place both from the "constant" and the varying quantities of rice. These observations afford further proof, if more evidence is required, of the impossibility of obtaining any one figure representing the absorptive co-efficient of the protein of rice, or indeed other cereals of a bulky nature when cooked, if the quantities of the food-stuffs forming the diets are high; they further show that the degree of protein absorption depends very largely on the- total mass of the diet. We would now draw attention to the very close similarity of the charts derived from the results in Buxar jail and Bhagalpur jail. In these observations where the quantities of rice given were similar in amount the charts appear to be practically identical. The Buxar chart, for reasons already mentioned, is on a lower scale. We show this comparison on Chart IX. (ii) Investigations to determine the different degrees of nitrogenous metabolism on diets composed of country rice, wheat ata, arhar dal and vegetables135 Diet I.

By plotting out these figures we obtain the curve showing the effects on pro- tein metabolism of this gradual increase in the quantity of wheat ata from 6 ozs. to 12 ozs. per man per day.

Diet I. Total output143 It would, therefore, appear that up to 12 ozs. of makkai ata may be taken with advantage in combination with 12 ozs. rice and the usual dal and vegetables. But it is almost impossible to get 12 ozs. of makkai eaten for more than a few days at a time: even in Bhagulpur we had difficulty in having the full ration taken. We may conclude, therefore, that 12 ozs. of makkai is about the maximum amount the prisoners will consume voluntarily; and our results show that it is not beyond. the amount from which the maximum absorption, in a diet of the above type, is able to take place. The 12 ozs. of makkai ata sanctioned in the jail code is about right if the quantity of rice be reduced to 12 ozs. per man daily. The effect of substituting makkai ata 12 ozs. for wheat ata 10 ozs. in Bhagulpur jail is shown on Chart XII. The results obtained corroborate what we found in the Buxar investigations, viz., it had the effect of placing the prisoners on a lower plane of nitrogenous metabolism. The average decrease in the amount of nitrogen undergoing metabolism from this substitution is not so great as in Buxar jail144 leave less residue for intestinal putrefaction. While this is true with regard to a diet containing 12 ozs. of wheat ata, will it be the case when the wheat ata is reduced to 10 ozs. per man daily ? The question, therefore, is:145 Diet II.

Total output150 The general conclusion arrived at from these investigations is the urgent necessity for a reduction in the quantities of rice given to the prisoners, both in the interests of their health and from motives of economy. The quantity of rice in the Bengal jail diets should be reduced by 8 ozs. per man daily, and in Behar diets by 4 ozs. per man daily. We have no hesitation in saying that, in effecting this economy to the State, the prisoners will be placed in a much better position as regards their nutrition, capabilities of doing work and general health. We now pass to some observations made on the effects of adding an animal protein to the Behari diet; but, as the level of nitrogenous metabolism is already high we did not consider it necessary to go into much detail regarding these effects.

151 Diet A. Total intake152 the mutton, i.e., the amount of protein absorbed from the basal diet remains con- stant, whether basal diet alone is given or basal diet plus mutton. From the evidence we have obtained this is only likely to occur when the basal diet provides an absorption of protein that approaches the lower limits of nitrogenous equi- librium, and is of a bulk less than that likely to interfere with absorption by its size alone. 2. What is far more likely to happen is that, the protein of mutton or other meat or fish being much more easily assimilated, the intestinal canal absorbs this protein readily and allows a much larger part, than when no animal protein is present, of the protein of the basal diet to pass out unabsorbed. We have already given a good deal of evidence that this is the case, and shall rest content with stating one example of it on the Behari type of diet.

Total intake of nitrogen =374.95 grms. Total output154 This is fairly close to the result already obtained in the previous investiga- tion, and would probably be still closer if we could make allowance for the effect of the diminution of the Burma rice of the diet by 10 ozs. per day for the batch of five men. We therefore find from this line of experiment that the addition of a certain small amount of animal diet does cause a large increase in the absorption of nitrogen from the diet. But, as we shall see in the next observation, this increase is by no means constant even for the addition of the same amount of meat, and that it also depends largely on the composition of the " basal diet " to which the meat is added. (iii) Investigations to show that the increase in the amount of nitrogenous metabolism may be no real measure of the amount absorbed from a highly assimilable form of protein which has been added to a " basal," diet. Thus, taking the diet155 What has happened is that more of the protein of the wheat ata, rice and dal has passed out unabsorbed which causes a seemingly very low absorption of the protein of mutton. In order, therefore, to be able to show by this method anything like a normal absorption of an animal protein when added to a purely vegetable diet, the bulk of the diet must not interfere, and the level of nitrogenous absorption from the vegetable part of the diet must not be high. Summary of Section 4. There is no necessity to add an animal protein to a diet of the Behari type. The level of protein metabolism is already high, fully two grammes of nitrogen superior in the case of the wheat diet to that of prisoners in Lower Bengal, and we do not consider it necessary to further increase it. On the other hand, if arrange- ments could be made for the substitution of fish twice a week in place of part of the dal and ata, we believe it would be to the advantage of the prisoners' health. This we would only recommend for prisoners in those jails where a local supply of fish is easily and cheaply obtainable. In Buxar and Bhagulpur jails it would be a fairly simple matter to have a supply of fish procured by prison labour from the Ganges which is within easy distance from the jails. If this could be done an economy could be effected by the saving of the dal, wheat or makkai ata twice a week, and, at the same time, the monotony of the prison fare would be relieved. We think that the suggestion is important, more particularly for the large central jails where long- term prisoners are confined, and where plenty of cheap labour is available. If it were found feasible we would recommend that the wheat or makkai ata be reduced in proportion to the amount of protein available from the fish. Also the question of the quantity of dal must be taken into consideration. We have shown 6 ozs. of dal to be the maximum amount that can be given; but there is no necessity to give this maximum. Reference to Tables XX and XXI will show that, with the amount of dal reduced from 6 ozs. to 5 ozs. the protein metabolism of the prisoners is on a higher level than obtains when the full quanti- ties of the constituents of the present diet is consumed. Further, there is no doubt that dal in any form has a decided tendency to produce diarrh156 With fish available, if it be found economical we would suggest that 5 ozs. of fish be given twice a week, replacing 2 ozs. of wheat or makkai ata and 1 oz. of dal. THE SUGGESTED SCALES. General diet. Diet on two days a week. Burma or country rice 12 ozs. Burma or country rice 12 ozs. Wheat ata 10 157 SECTION 5. ( i ) Relative value of Burma and Country rice. This subject will be found referred to in the work recorded on prisoners in the Presidency jail, Calcutta, and Buxar jail. In the Presidency jail, Calcutta, where the prisoners have been getting Burma rice only from the time of their incarceration, the protein absorption from the different diets containing Burma rice was on the average higher than that observed in Puri jail, where locally grown rice was always in use. Further, on placing two batches of prisoners in the Presidency jail on abso- lutely similar diets, but replacing the Burma by country rice, there was a distinct fall in the actual amount of protein absorbed from the diet. Thus a batch of 10 healthy Bengali prisoners on a diet of Burma rice, mixed massur and arhar dal and vegetables, gave an average nitrogenous metabolism of 7.60 grms., while the same prisoners under exactly the same conditions, save that country rice replaced the Burma rice, showed a fall in nitrogenous metabolism to just 7.00 grms. This would appear to mean that the protein of Burma rice is more easily ab- sorbed than that of country rice158 quantity, there appears to be very little difference in the amount of protein absorp- tion from diets containing different dals, with the exception of gram dal. This con- tains a much lower percentage of protein than the other types, and its protein does not appear to be so easily absorbed. Any difference that exists in the protein absorption of the different dals is, in all probability, due to a difference in the relative difficulty of thoroughly cooking them. The cooking of dals and of the different constituents of the dietaries is a most important question, and one we have been unable to touch; but there can be no doubt that the very deficient protein absorption from the jail dietaries is intimately connected with the way in which the food is prepared. (iii) The relative values of wheat and makkai ata. The relative values of these two food-stuffs have already been fully discussed. When 12 ozs. of makkai ata are given in place of 10 ozs. of wheat ata we found that it made an average difference of about one gramme of nitrogen in the amounts absorbed from the two diets with varying quantities of rice. This works out to over 10 per cent. of a decrease in the of nitrogenous metabolism. When equal quantities of makkai and wheat ata are given in substitution for one another (Buxar jail) we saw that the level of protein metabolism was decreased 1.6 grms. on the average, the makkai ata being used with varying quantities of rice. On contrasting, however, the proportion of protein of makkai with that of wheat ata, in a diet containing 10 ozs. of each, we obtain a full explanation of the lower absorption from makkai ata: the protein of makkai ata is to that of wheat ata as 9.55: 12.24, i.e., as 1: 1.2, and we found that under the same conditions the average absorption from a diet containing makkai was to that of a diet containing wheat as 8.03: 9.69, i.e., as 1: 1.2 (see Charts III and V). It follows from this that the protein of makkai ata is, under the same condi- tions, as well' assimilated as that of wheat ata. This is an important result, as it is generally stated that makkai is much less easily absorbed than wheat how- ever, our investigations do not bear out that contention, but show, on the contrary, that practically the same percentage of the protein of the two food-stuffs is absorbed when they are given under the same conditions. The fact that the ratio of the percentages of the protein of makkai ata and wheat ata tallies with the ratio of absorption of those proteins affords a valuable check on the accuracy of the figures on which the charts are founded. We present on Chart XIV composite curves obtained by averaging the results of the investigation carried out in Buxar and Bhagulpur jails on diets of makkai
159 and wheat ata, when the rice was in varying quantities in the several diets. This chart shows very clearly the relative value of makkai and wheat ata, so far as protein absorption is concerned, makkai being given in quantities of 11 ozs. and wheat ata in quantities of 10 ozs. Both curves present the same features in almost every detail, showing the gradual rise as the rice is increased from 8 to 10 ozs., the sudden increase in protein absorption from 10 to 12 ozs., and the typical fall after the amount of rice has been increased beyond the optimum. The point on the chart for 14 ozs. is calculated; as in Bhagulpur jail this figure was irregular from a fall in the amount of makkai ata consumed. General summary of results obtained. 1. We have shown the worth of the dietaries of Bengal in grms. of proximate principles, and pointed out that their real nutritive value is very different from their apparent worth. The chemical values of the diets in round numbers are, in protein, for Lower Bengal diets 93 grms. and for Behar 106 grms.; the real nutritive value for Lower Bengal is 49 grms. and for Behar 60 grms. In other words a little over 50 per cent. of the protein is absorbed from the dietaries when given in full quantities. 2. We discussed the causes of this low absorption and have shown that one important factor in retarding the metabolism of protein from the full diet is bulki- ness, affecting both types of diet. We brought forward much evidence to show that a mere decrease in the bulk of the diet was sufficient to permit of a greater relative and absolute absorption of protein; and, working with varying quantities of the different food-stuffs, we gradually worked out the amount of each food-stuff that should be given in a diet, in order that the absorption from that diet may be at a maximum160 putrefaction. Further, we showed that, by giving the several food-stuffs in the quantities which we suggest, the acknowledged excessive carbohydrates of the diets are brought down to more nearly physiological amounts, and that the intestinal juices are given a fair opportunity of discharging their duties, so that intestinal fermentation will be checked and a better absorption of carbohydrates will be obtained. If we had any means of investigating the metabolism of carbohydrates we should, in all probability, obtain a curve very similar to that given in Chart II which shows the actual absorption of protein from diets containing different quantities of rice. It is quite fair to assume that the conditions present in the diets that entail so defective an absorption of protein will also tend to prevent the full value of their carbohydrate elements being made use of. These condi- tions will remain in force until the food has passed those parts of the intestinal canal where absorption of both protein and carbohydrates is possible; but, having arrived at the large bowel, the carbohydrates are rapidly broken down by fermentative processes, and their potential energy is dissipated, so that estimation of the carbohydrates passed out in the fæces is of no value as a criterion of the percentage of that element wasted and lost to the economy. This is not the case with the protein element, for the nitrogen left over from absorption must pass out in the fæces in some nitrogenous form, either inorganic or organic, as, for instance, in the form of organised micro-organisms, for whose growth it forms the essential pabulum. The estimation of the nitrogen of the fæces, therefore, gives a true indication of the amount of residual waste from the protein of the diet. We have confirmed our results by this method particu- larly in the cases of Presidency jail, Puri jail, and Midnapore jail. We have given graphic records of the effects on protein metabolism obtained from diets providing varying quantities of the different elements when all but one constituent of the diet remained constant. In this way, we have been able to plot out the curves of the absorption, of protein for different types of diets. In all these investigations we worked with the diet as a unit, and did not accept the assumption that there would always be the same actual absorption from the "basal" or our "constant "part of the diet, with varying quantities of the food- stuff under investigation. In fact, we have shown that the above-mentioned assumption, while practically true for diets of the European type where an average of 90 per cent. of the protein is absorbed, does not hold good for dietaries of the Bengal type. It is not possible to work out an absorptive protein co-efficient for the several food-stuffs, and find that this percentage of its protein will be absorbed under varying conditions. We find, on the contrary, that the absorptive co- efficient varies more or less inversely with the bulk of the diet, and with the amount of vegetable protein present in the diet; and it is only after a great reduction in bulk, and in diets whose protein metabolism. approaches the lower
161 physiological limits that the addition of more of a food-stuff will show an increased protein absorption corresponding to a co-efficient of absorption similar to that obtained in European types of diets. A great deal of work has been done on the effects of adding wheat ata or an animal protein to the Lower Bengal dietaries and an animal protein to the Behar diets. These effects we have fully discussed in the summaries of the sections dealing with them and we have nothing more to add on this subject. 3. We have stated that, while the addition of an animal protein is not by any means essential, at the same time there is little doubt that, if it were econo- mically possible thus to permit of a reduction of the amount of dal in both Lower Bengal and Behar dietaries, the general health of the jails would improve. From investigations on the microscopic compositions of the fæces it would appear that the dal granule is the most difficult of all to break down, and that the slightest lowering of the general health is usually accompanied by the passage of undigest- ed dal. This has clearly been shown by Lane* in the microscopic examination of the fæces of prisoners for intestinal parasites; the presence of more or less harmless parasites being sufficient to cause the passage of large quantities of unchanged dal granules. It is easy to replace part of the dal in Bengal jails by wheat ata without increasing the cost162 If this be not feasible we strongly recommend that the 6 ozs. of dal be reduced to 5 ozs. per man daily. The dietaries we recommended would, therefore, be:163 From data supplied by jail officers we find that rice costs on an average one anna per man daily, so that there should be a saving of 3 pies on each prisoner per day. Calculating on a basis of 16,000 prisoners in Bengal, from rice alone this would work out at a saving of over three-quarters of a lac of rupees yearly. Besides this, if our suggested means of obtaining fish were possible, there would very nearly be a similar saving on dal, wheat and makkai ata. The details would require to be worked out with regard to local conditions, but we have no doubt that in most of the central jails, and in many of the smaller, fish could be cheaply obtained. On the whole there would certainly be a lac of rupees saved every yearCHAPTER III. Report on six months' use of special diets in Puri Jail. By the end of 1908 we had obtained undoubted evidence of the beneficial effect of a reduction of the bulk of the ordinary jail diet on the level of protein metabolism; it was therefore necessary to determine whether such a reduction would be accompanied by a maintenance in the standard of the prisoners' health and their physical condition. With this object in view it was decided, in consultation with the Officiating Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India165 placed on accurately weighed diets given as above for classes A and B, and the amount of nitrogen undergoing metabolism estimated. The figures obtained will show that practical identical amounts of nitrogen were absorbed from the diet of class A during the different periods, and from that of class B during the different periods; thus again proving that the level of nitrogenous meta- bolism is dependent on the quantity of absorbable protein offered in a diet, and not affected, at least to any great extent, by the time during which an individual has been on that diet. The work done in estimating the degree of nitrogenous metabolism present during these periods also shows how very marked an influence a diminution in the quantity of rice and dal and a substitution for them of a certain amount of wheat ata or fish, has in raising the relative and actual percentage of protein absorption. We shall first give an account of this work and then analyse the figures collected to show the effects of the diets. Puri Jail. Investigations to establish the level of protein metabolism at the beginning and at the end of the six months' experiment: the two classes A and B of prisoners having been kept on their respective diets continuously during the whole period.

Total nitrogenous metabolism= 204.70 grms. = 69.00 p. c. of the total N. of the diet. = 8.19 grms. of N. per man daily. 2nd Period, July 1909. Country rice 18 ozs. Mixed dals 4 " Wheat ata 4 " Vegetables 6 " Total N. of intake=296.30 grms. Total nitrogenous metabolism=203.78 grins. = 68.77 per cent. of total N. of diet. = 8.15 grms. of N. per man daily. Collating these results we find167 sions from the incidence of sickness. There were very few cases of sickness serious enough to call for admission into hospital amongst the prisoners in either class. Thus in the return for 1998 with an average daily strength of 174.59 there were 92 admissions into hospital, while during the six months the prisoners were on these modified diets the total admission into hospital were on a very much lower scale. While this is statisfactory, so far as it goes, no conclusions can be drawn from it, as the sickness rates vary very much from year to year quite independent of the diet. The only means of contrasting the results of the change that gives any real measure of comparison is its effects on the body-weight, and even this is apt to be fallacious. If the special diets had only been given to prisoners newly admitted and their effects on the body-weight noted, a comparison with the results of former years would have been of value but we had to place the total prisoners of the jail on the diets and the number of new admissions was too small to afford conclusive evidence. It is well-known that prisoners on first admission increase in body-weight to a very marked extent. Thus the percentage of those who increased in weight during the year 1907 was 58 and in 1908 was 53.8 in the jails of Bengal. In 1908, 62 per cent. of the prisoners in Puri jail increased in body-weight. We have by a comparison with these figures a means of measuring the results obtained from the change of diet. Class A. Fish Diet. (1). Total prisoners on this diet for a period up to one month=165. Of these 94 increased in weight by an average of 2.6 lbs. " " 55 decreased " " " " 1.9 lbs.

" " 19 decreased " " " " 2.1 lbs. " " 21 remained stationary. = 61 per cent. gained in body-weight. (iii). Total prisoners on this diet for a period exceeding two months=31. Of these 20 increased in weight by an average of 4.3 lbs. " " 6 decreased " " " " " 2.0 lbs. " " 5 remained stationary. =64 per cent. gained in body-weight. That is, for the usual period during which prisoners are retained in a small district jail, like Puri jail, the percentage of those showing an increase in body-
168 weight is quite up to the average even when the total bulk of the jail diet is considerably diminished by a decrease of 8 ozs. in the amount of rice, 2 ozs. in the amount of dalCHAPTER IV. The effect of the large quantity of salt given in Bengal Jails dietaries. The quantity of salt given in the diet scales of Bengal jails is 14/16th of an ounce which, when added to the salt contained in the food materials, brings the total up to well over an ounce or about 30 grms. of salt in the daily diet. It will be readily admitted that this is an excessive quantity and much beyond the physiological needs of the body. Von Noorden states that probably the presence of as little as 3 or 4 grammes of salt in the daily diet is a sufficient protection against the loss of chlorine; and, so long as the chlorine supply does not fall below this, the decrease in the amount excreted in the urine will correspond to the diminished intake by the mouth. In recent years, due mainly to the researches of Widal, the question of salt in the diet has become a very important one, more particularly in connection with the causation of 170 the altered vessels. He finds that retention of salt and water not only alters the clinical picture of inflammation, but has a more or less injurious influence on its course. If the serous membranes are involved in the inflammation there is greatly increased effusion. In inflammation generally the effusion is reabsorbed the more rapidly the less the salt taken in the food. The reduced proportion of salt leads to a power- ful osmotic current from the tissues out into the blood and increases the diuresis, which further reduces the pressure in the interstices of the tissues, and this in turn favours reabsorption of the morbid effusion. Mendel describes striking cases to show how the course of a burn can, thus be modified, also eczema, epididymitis, joint affections, venous thrombosis and arterio-sclerosis. The whole bearing of the results of recent research on the salt question is to show that, when given in quantities above the physiological limits, salt is retained in the tissues; and, as it cannot be retained as crystals of sodium chloride, but only in a more or less isotonic solution, water to form that solution must also be retained in proportion to the amount of salt stored up in the body. The result is a more watery condition of the tissues of the body and, therefore, an increase in body-weight. Marey and Widal's experiments have clearly demonstrated these results in healthy individuals whose kidneys were quite permeable to chlorides. Now, so long as the tissues are healthy and uninjured no sign of this water-logged condition appears beyond the increase in body-weight; but, if for any reason injury is received, no matter what form of injury it may be171 It may be accepted with regard to salt metabolism that, like protein, its level is determined by supply172 Puri Jail. 1.

173 What do we find from this investigation ? With practically 20 grms. of salt per man daily :174 was passed in the fæces per man daily; with 6.5 grms. 0.43 grm. passed in the fæces per man daily. (v) It will be noticed that a larger quantity of NaCl was eliminated in the urine and fæces than was present in the intake during the period that the prisoners were getting 6.5 grms. daily. The excess derived from the salt stored in the body, over the four days we have taken into consideration, is very small175 2. The effects of a gradual decrease in the amount of salt in the diet.

This, we consider, is an impossibility unless the NaCl is reabsorbed by the skin as evaporation of the sweat180 4. We now give an account of some observations carried out on two of the trained assistants engaged on these investigations, in order to determine the effects of varying the salt intake on the body-weight, and on the amounts of urine excreted.

They confirm the results already obtained from work on prisoners. Another point of importance noted was that both Assistants got diarrh182 This means that 0.38 grm. NaCl per man daily is passed in the fæces, a lower figure than is usually obtained. Our reasons for giving this series are the increase in the amount of salt passed in the fæces when the dal is increased, and the diminished amount of salt pre- sent when the amount of dal is decreased. We found under the ordinary conditions of jail diet that the amount of salt appearing in the fæces was practically constant at 0.5 grm. per man daily; we now find that by varying the amount of dal in the diet a corresponding variation takes place in the elimination of salt in the fæces. This would appear to show that the salt of the fæces is largely derived from the dal in diets of the Lower Bengal type, and that dal is, therefore, less thoroughly digest- ed and broken up than the other constituents of the diet. A great many investigations besides those referred to have been made on the effects of increasing and decreasing the amount of salt in the daily food of prisoners ; in fact, the estimations of the chlorides in the excreta were made in all the meta- bolism experiments. Nothing save the points already brought out in the examples we have given is at present evident. One fact with regard to the Behari type of diet we may mention, viz., that the amount of salt passed in the fæces is higher than in the diets of Lower Bengal, being nearly 1 grm. per man daily. This we would expect from the larger amount of salt contained in wheat and maize than in rice, and the greater actual amount of the diet that is unabsorbed and passed in the fæces. The outstanding features of the results of these investigations on salt metabolism are the very high degree of absorption of salt that does occur, and the comparatively small amount found in the intestinal excreta. In Chart XV we give in graphic form the effects of varying the quantity of salt in the diet on the amount of salt eliminated by the skin, the quantity of urine excreted, and on the percentage body-weight.
CHAPTER V. Some side-issues of the investigation. 1. The relationship, if any, that exists between the amount of urine passed and the quantity of rice in the diet. A comparison of the urine excreted on different amounts of rice in the diets is only given when the conditions that obtained were, as far as possible, the same. The observations were carried out at the same time of the year when, the tempera- ture, humidity, etc., were fairly constant. The quantity of the salt given in the diet was always identical. (a) PRESIDENCY JAIL, CALCUTTA. (i).184 These observations were made in October 1908 while it was still sultry, and they again show a decrease in the amount of urine passed when the quantity of rice in the diet was lessened. (iii).185 The average quantity of urine passed per day by these prisoners shows prac- tically no variation for different quantities of dal, so long as the salt and rice of the diets do not change, and the climatic conditions are the same. Note the very large amount of urine passed by these prisoners even during the hot months of the year. From the results stated it appears probable that a casual relationship can be traced between the amount of Burma rice in the diet and the quantity of urine excreted. We have only one set of observations, in which different quantities of country rice formed part of the diets, other conditions all being identical. (b) PURI JAIL. Four prisoners under observation for ten days. 1st period of five days. Per man daily. Remarks. DIET186 In these observations the conditions were identical, except for the varying amounts of Burma rice. The same relationship is noticeable between the amount of rice and the quantity of urine excreted. Again will be evident the large amount of urine that these prisoners passed daily; the work was carried out in January 1909, i.e., in the middle of the cold weather. (ii) Reference to table XI (Buxar Jail) bears out the same contention when the same batches of prisoners on varying amounts of Burma rice are taken. Thus187 The evidence obtained from investigations on the Behar prisoners in Buxar jail who ate Burma rice would thus appear to support the view that a relationship exists between the amount of rice in the diet and the amount of urine passed. (d) BHAGALPUR JAIL. Is the evidence of the Bhagalpur results of the same nature ? (i) On Table XVI will be found Batch I188 From these observations it would appear probable that a larger quantity of urine is secreted when the intake of rice is high than when it is low. What the cause is189 unable to say; but it will be readily admitted that if a diuretic influence does exist, its continuous action from the massive amounts of rice in the daily diet of Bengali prisoners cannot be for the welfare of the kidney epithelium. The supposed influence of Burma rice in the causation of Beriberi190 (iii) Sixteen Ooriya prisoners observed for twelve consecutive days, aver- age weight of fresh fæces per man daily 14.1 ozs. (iv) Four prisoners observed for eleven consecutive days, average weight of fresh fæces per man daily 14.4 ozs. Therefore an average of191 Four Ooriya prisoners observed over eleven consecutive days, average weight of fresh fæces per man daily 16.64 ozs. We may, therefore, conclude that the weight of fæces passed daily by prisoners on the Bengal jail dietaries is in round numbers one lb. per man daily, i.e., from three to four times the weight of fæces passed ordinarily by a European on his diet. A reduction in the quantity of rice entails a decrease in the weight of the fæces, but the weight of the fæces seems to be greater when wheat ata is sub- stituted for an equal quantity of rice. 4.192 In a purely vegetable diet such as that of the prisoners in Bengal a high uric acid excretion would not be expected, as vegetable food contains only small amounts of purin bodies. The pulses, however, do contain a fair quantity of nucleins. We have made a good many observations on the amount of uric acid excreted by Bengali prisoners and find the quantity to be very much what would be expected from a vegetarian diet. Thus, in 690 uric acid determinations the amount excreted per man daily was, on the average, 0.44 grms. The variations met with were small and never fluctuated for the Bengal types of diets outside 0.35 and 0.57 grm. per man daily. These figures include deter- minations on prisoners on both the Bengali and Behari types of diets193 7.194 hydrolytic products, and of ammonia with the rest, will be formed195 From these figures we find that the percentage of the total nitrogen excreted in the form of ammonia is 7.92 or 0.85 grm. per day. This is decidedly higher than would be expected from the results given for Europeans. The diets on which some of the prisoners were during these observations contained meat and fish, so that they were not entirely vegetable in character. (ii) Twenty Behari prisoners under observation for fifteen days: the urine was pooled and samples tested for ammonia. The diet consisted of Burma rice, wheat ata, mung dal and vegetables196 By collating these results we see at a glance their full import197 In order to obtain some information on this problem the following investiga- tion was carried out:198 What do we learn from these results ? BATCH APART II. The relationship of Food to Physical Development. " It is food that supplies the material for that perpetual series of transforma- tions in which life consists, and it must be adequate in quantity and suitable in quality if these transformations, of so many different kinds, in so many different organs, are to proceed with that nicely balanced adjustment that is known as health; nutrition is therefore an important branch of preventive medicine."1 In our work so far we have had no necessity to face the much-discussed ques- tion raised by Chittenden, viz., what is the proper daily protein intake necessary to meet the needs of the body ? Much has been said, and well said, for and against the views put forward by Chittenden. In the presidential address from which we quote above, published in the Journal of the Royal Institute of Preventive Medicine, Sir J. Crichton-Browne deals with the evidence for and against in a masterly manner. His general conclusions200 and by an analysis of the records of the physical development of Bengali and Anglo- Indian students in the same College, under the same climatic conditions, doing the same work, but on a different diet201 a quantity that Chittenden would consider excessive, particularly so, when the large carbohydrate and fuel value of their present dietaries is taken into, account. The Behari, we found, averaged .a nitrogenous metabolism of 9.50 grms. per man daily; his body-weight may be taken in round numbers to be, on the average, 55 kilos. This means the metabolism of 0.173 grm. of nitrogen per man daily, again very much in excess of what Chittenden would consider the protein require- ments of the body. Our proposals would increase the nitrogenous metabolism of the Bengali on the Lower Bengal diet up to 9.00 gems. per man daily or 0.180 grm. nitrogen per- kilo of body-weight, while the suggested diet scale for the Behari would permit of a nitrogenous metabolism on even a higher level than at present. The effects, therefore, of the proposed changes in Bengal jail diets would be to. increase very considerably the protein metabolism of the Bengali and slightly so that of the Behari, while at the same time getting rid of some of the excessive carbohydrate and heat value of the dietaries, the beneficial effects of which we have already fully discussed. This is entirely at variance with Chittenden's views, as according to his standards the dietaries are already excessive in both protein and carbohydrate. The question, therefore, arises, is there any necessity to raise the level of the protein metabolism of the prisoners ? We have given one very good and sufficient reason, viz., the urgent necessity to. obtain a higher percentage of protein absorption and thus reduce to as low a figure as possible the large protein waste by the bowel, thereby lessening putrefaction. This we have shown can be done by decreasing the rice and dal of the Bengali diet, and the rice of the Behari. The necessity of raising the level of nitrogenous meta- bolism by the addition of a more assimilable protein is on a different footing, and to a consideration of this question we shall now turn. We shall not go into details regarding the criticisms that have been made on Chittenden's proposals, or the experimental evidence that has accumulated against them; we shall content ourselves with stating the results obtained from our work in Bengal, and the practical deductions to be drawn therefrom. One or two points we should like, however, to refer to as they will be found to have a somewhat close relationship to the conditions present in Bengal. Chittenden's standard of protein food is less than one half of that of Voit, and conflicts violently with the common practice of the majority of mankind. " It is. an initial objection to Chittenden's views which is not easily met, that it contra- venes all human experience. If he is right, then all the world up to this time has. been wrong. It is Chittenden contra mundum.............deep down beneath all superficial fluctuations and gradual evolutions there are certain fundamental, 2D
202 instinctive nutritional demands that cannot be interfered with without risk. These are embodied, in old time tradition and customs, and one of these is a demand for a protein intake much more than double, indeed nearly treble, what Chittenden would allow."1 How do these hereditary instincts and customs in the formation of his dietetic habits and in the choice of food stand with respect to the Bengali ? We may at once say that another factor, and a very important one as regards the great mass of mankind, comes in, viz., the cost of food materials. The Bengali lives on. the cheapest food available and, in a country not yet thoroughly opened up, the cheapest food is usually the home-grown product. We, therefore, find the Bengali living almost entirely on his home-grown rice and dal ; the Behari on his home-grown rice, dal and ata; the hill tribes, which we shall have to deal with separately in this connection, are not satisfied with these simple vege- table materials but demand a much more varied and costly diet. The Bengali or Behari is in the great majority of cases only a vegetarian by force of circumstances: where he can afford other additional items as fish, milk or mutton, he readily avails himself of the opportunity of thus increasing his assimil- able protein intake. This desire for nitrogenous food. and particularly food of an animal nature was well brought home to us in the feeding experiments on prison- ers, when the promise of meat, or the threat of withholding it, was quite sufficient to induce the prisoners to carry out without a murmur whatever was desired of them. It was further exemplified by the difficulty that we sometimes experienced in having fish or meat cooked without a fair proportion of it disappearing; this neces- sitated our having to place guards over the meat until it had been distributed to the batches for whom it was intended. The great mass of the people, however, can only afford the cheap home-grown rice and dal with occasional additions of more palatable elements. Their instincts, therefore, for a better form of dietary are held in check by an inability to meet the cost of gratifying them. In order to make up in quantity for deficiency in quality we find that the Bengali has accustomed himself to consume what to a European seem enormous quantities of rice and even dal ; the same also is true to some extent of the Behari. We know what the results of this limited diet of rice and dal in the Bengali, or rice, dal and ata in the Behari mean as regards the level of nitrogenous metabol- ism. We have shown previously that the average amount of protein undergoing metabolism in the case of the Bengali reaches the very lowest physiological limits in fact it would be more accurate to call it almost protein starvation. This is not by any means so marked in the Behari, who, with part of his diet made up of 1 Sir James Crichton-Browne: loc. cit.
203 the more assimilable protein of wheat ata, is placed on a higher level of nitrogenous metabolism. We may conclude, therefore, that the people of the province of Bengal are largely vegetarians, but are so only through force of circumstances204 Nitti 1expresses the conviction that the proportion of protein in a diet is one of the great determining factors in the productive capacity of a nation. We need hardly instance, in this connection, the rapid and remarkable rise of Japan amongst the nations coincident with a vastly increased consumption of animal food, or the recorded fact that during the late war the Japanese troops had a more abundant protein diet than any other army in the field has ever enjoyed. There is, therefore, a fairly general consensus of opinion that the sociological conditions, enterprise, vigour and physical development of a people are intimately bound up with the quantity of assimilable protein in their dietaries. These influences of dietaries, and the effects of the different amounts of protein offered capable of absorption, are remarkably well brought out by a study of the general status and physical welfare of the different classes of the inhabitants of Bengal. 1. The Bengali.205 during the several years of attendance at one of the residential Colleges in Calcutta. Under the same conditions but on difference diets we saw that :206 The general conclusion to be drawn from these investigations on the Bengali is that his physical development207 be accounted for by the greater muscular development208 prolonged exposure to the actinic rays of the sun, the cause of debility to which Professor Woodruff of the United States army has been calling attention with some considerable show of evidence. Still another factor of importance is the immature age at which these people usually marry. Many of the Indians, how ever, are strong and robust people. I understand that an Indian regiment made up entirely of natives is the finest lot of men in His Majesty's Service." Now in this apparently fair and honest criticism there are put forward several definite causes to account for the acknowledged low standard of nutrition in the Bengali, with its accompanying inferior muscular development, lack of endurance, and poor capacity for work. To enumerate these,209 future will do so to different races210 the different races; so that the inclusion of the Bengali among the great fighting races of India is, therefore, quite easily understood. Nor would the point have called for any comment had it not been that the true facts afford still further evi- dence of the important rôle played by diet. The Bengali has never, so far as we are aware, in modern times been recruited for the fighting line, and, although many regiments were called Bengal Infantry, Bengal Cavalry, etc., not a single man carrying a rifle could claim Lower Bengal as his place of birth. We have no desire to labour the point, but the question arises: Why is the Bengali unfit for the fight- ing line when other inhabitants of the plains exposed to, and suffering from, practi- cally all the disabilities that Dr. Kellogg enumerates211 says, "that large meat-eaters are generally more cruel and ferocious than other men." Experiments carried out by feeding one series of young monkeys on vegetable and another series on a highly animal diet confirm the same opinion212 the Bengali and the inhabitants of these hills is exceedingly marked. They appear more like people of different parts of the universe rather than neighbours separated by barely 50 miles of country. Some of their more prominent characterist cs have already been alluded to, and strike the new-comer very forcibly. The men, women and children are jolly, light-hearted, always laughing, joking and chatting, the children playing, skipping, singing as they run about, very much in the way children do in England. This is all the very antithesis of What will be found in Bengal proper and Orissa. The children in Bengal are poor, miserable, pot-bellied little creatures with little or no joy in their lives compared with these happy-looking, well-fed children of the hills. The hill-people generally are healthy, strong and well-developed, some being of really fine physique; they are full of energy and capable of the most arduous and sustained muscular exertion. The loads that even the women and half-grown children are capable of carry- ing up the steepest hills are incredible and, until seen with one's own eyes, would certainly not be believed possible. So far as could be gathered, two factors account for the marked contrasts between the Bengali and these hill-tribes, viz., climate and diet. The other factors mentioned by Dr. Kellogg are even more in evidence, particularly sexual excesses, than in Bengal. While we have no doubt climate has a great deal to do with the higher scale of general development and capabilities, that it is not the whole story can be shown by a comparison of the several classes living under practically iden- tical conditions but with difference in dietary forming the one outstanding influence on their respective attributes. We can thus by a study of the different classes eliminate to a very great extent the effects of climate, and appraise at its proper value the influence of the different dietaries on the physique and general well-being of the mass of individuals forming the several tribes. We shall take up the facts that we have been able to collect under the follow- ing headings :213 Height varies between 5 feet 6 inches and 5 feet 7 inches. Tallest214 The calf is well-developed also in the Nepalese, but on a somewhat lower scale than in the Bhutias. The Bhutia from his earliest years is accustomed to the carrying of weights215 (c) General diet of the more poorly-fed classes who earn lower wages. Rice 16 to 18 ozs. Average value computed to be 24 grms. of nitrogen or 150 grms. protein of which over 70 per cent. is derived from an animal source. Meat 16 ozs. Vegetables 8 ozs. Cheese 2 ozs. Alcoholic liquor 2 pints (d) Diet of Sikkim Bhutias (hard working classes). Rice 16 ozs. Average value of the diet com- puted to be worth 21 grms. nitrogen or 131 grms. protein of which over 70 per cent. is derived from an animal source. Meat 16 ozs. Vegetables, wine, etc. as before Dal 2 ozs. (e) Diet of Lepchas (poorer classes of Sikkim Bhutias). Rice. 28 to 30 ozs. Average value of the diet 18. 5 grms. of nitrogen or 115 grms. protein of which about 50 per cent. is derived from an animal source. Meat 8 to 10 ozs. Other items same as before. II.216 Here we have in vogue amongst the Bhutias dietaries in which over 60 per cent. of the nitrogen is derived from an animal source; even accepting that the whole of the rice of their diet was consumed, this in itself would mean that the level of protein metabolism amongst them is relatively very high. Further, the constant hard work of their daily round calls for a very large expenditure of energy, so that the digestion of rice and other carbonaceous ingredients of the diet is also placed on a higher level than is found in the Bengali; we may take it, therefore, that at least 75 per cent. of this diet is absorbed under natural conditions. (This is in all probability too low an estimate, but it may be allowed to stand as it errs on the right side.) That is, the Bhutia shows a nitrogenous metabolism of about 19.2 grms. per day, or per kilo of body-weight 0.35 grm. of nitrogen. The average weight of the Tibetan or Nepalese Bhutia is, over the numbers weighed, 60 kilos or 128 to 132 lbs.1 We see, therefore, that the level of nitrogenous meta- bolism is practically three times that laid down by Chittenden, and twice that of the standard to which we hope to raise Bengal prisoners. By the same method of calculation the nitrogenous metabolism of the Nepalese and poorer classes of the Sikkim Bhutias would work out at an average of about 13 grms. or the metabolism of 0.25 grm. of nitrogen per kilo of body- weight; whilst that for the Nepalese cultivator and poorer classes of Nepalese is lower still, due to the absence of meat except on one or two days a week. We, therefore, find that the dietaries show a gradual decline in the amount of nitrogen per kilo of body-weight undergoing metabolism, and, in accordance with this observation, it will be evident there is an accompanying gradual fall in the phy- sique and general developmental conditions of the different tribes from Nepalese and Tibetan Bhutia to Sikkim Bhutia, and lastly to the lower classes of the Nepalese. This can only be explained on the basis of differences of diet: for the other factors put forward by Dr. Kellogg are common to all the tribes and particularly to the individuals examined in and around Darjeeling. Tó anyone who has seen the strong, muscular dandywalla and the altogether slighter though compactly built Nepalese no evidence will be required to bring out the superior physical development of the former; and when along with this we find the Bhutia reaching a level of protein metabolism much higher than the Nepalese, the conclusion that a close relationship exists between the scale of protein metabolism and muscularity is justifiable. The evidence, therefore, afforded by investigations on the dietaries and gen- eral development of these tribes corroborates the conclusions already arrived at from a comparison of the Bengali, Behari and217 is a function of the protein metabolism possible from the diet. It is worthy of note that there is very little dysentery, diarrh218 We, therefore, see that a fairly high percentage of the total nitrogen of the diet is absorbed even though it does contain a large amount of rice. The metabolism of practically 16 grms. of protein per man daily is very much greater than anything we found in the Bengali or Behari, and makes very evident the superior type of diet that these tribes live on. For these six prisoners the nitrogenous metabolism works out to be 0.284 grm. per kilo of body-weight, over two and a half times the quantity stated by Chittenden to be more than sufficient to meet the nitrogenous requirements of the body; yet this diet is not by any means so high in protein as that to which the well-paid and superior classes of the Nepalese and Tibetan Bhutias are accustomed. This diet is worth in round numbers about 140 grms. of protein, whereas the dietaries of the Tibetan Bhutias may be taken to have an average value of 160 grms., with a maximum approaching closely 200 to 220 grms. per man daily. (b) In order to determine the degree of nitrogenous metabolism attained by Bhutias and Nepalese on the ordinary jail diet we placed a mixed batch of six prisoners on the diet in use in Darjeeling jail. This diet appears to vary in the quantities of the different ingredients from day to day, but it is made up of . . . . Rice, makkai ata, (porridge) dal and vegetables.

Total output221 nitrogenous metabolism than Chittenden's standard. So far, our work corrobo- rates his results. But when we look at the other side of the question and make an attempt to estimate what the effects of dietaries, providing so low a standard of nitrogen absorption, are on the physical well-being of the people we are forced by the evidence to attach much greater importance to the glaring ill-effects of such diets than to their physiological economy or the supposed advantages of a low protein intake to the excretory system. From a study of the urine, blood, physical development and general capabili- ties of the Bengali we expressed the conviction that the diet on which he subsists was largely to blame for his miserably poor physique and want of vigour. Nothing we have learned in this further study has tended to contravert that opinion; on the contrary, the more the subject has been gone into the stronger the evidence becomes of its correctness. It is admitted by everyone that, compared with the working European, the Bengali labourer is on a very low scale; vegetarians and the followers of Chittenden have assigned every possible cause that could be thought of, except diet, as offering a full and complete explanation of the Bengali's inferior capabilities. We have discussed these hazy, ill-defined influences and, whilst admitting the probable force of some of them, have largely eliminated them by contrasting individuals, tribes or races in which all these factors are identical, but in which diet alone forms the distinguishing element, or222 appear to be the determining factors of the several causes that go to relegate, fix and maintain the position of a people, tribe or race in the scale of mankind. Of all the different races that we have investigated the scale of the relative de- velopment, vigour and general muscularity is easily fixed. The following may be taken as showing how the several tribes would be placed, together with the several degrees of nitrogenous metabolism per kilo of body-weight to which they attain:223 the average aborigine is a most capable worker, bright, cheery and alive to his surroundings. In muscular development he is very superior to the Bengali, but, as would be expected from his diet, inferior to most of the Bhutias and Nepalese. His physical development and general capabilities would again confirm the con- clusions already arrived at from a study of the Bengali, Behari and Bhutia, viz., that the position of a tribe or race in the scale of physical development is largely a matter of the amount of absorbable protein offered in the dietaries. The differences in the natural dietaries of these four tribes are not sufficiently well marked to show any real distinction in physical development. We append the notes which Major Maddox was able to obtain. Pators or Paters. These people were originally Mundas, but have now become completely Hinduized. The Pators, or Pator Mundas as they are often called, are only found in what used to be the Rahey thana circle, this part now being divided up between the Sonahatu and Silli thanas. Closely related to them, and practically similar in all respects, are the Kangar Mundas found round Ranch itself and Khunti. It is not known how long ago these people became Hinduized, but there seems to be no doubt of their origin. Though they speak Hindi and Bengali to some extent, their language among themselves is Mundari. They eat the flesh of fowls and goats, but never eat cow or buffalo or pig. They consider themselves higher than Mundas, Uraons, Sawansis or Lohars, and do not intermarry with or eat with them. The original work of the caste seems to have been oil-making and selling, but now they also do some cultivation. The general physique of these people is better than that of the Mundas so far as can be seen. Average height and weight of 100 Pater prisoners. Food at home, daily quantity and animal food taken. Height 224 It is believed that at one time they peopled the whole of Northern India, but they never seem to have gone to the southern part of the Peninsula. They have also been identified with a black race who for a long time peopled the southern part of China, and was finally driven out by the Chinese after many years of extremely bloody warfare. They can also be traced by some physical peculiarities and by certain rules of their language to be connected with some of the aborigines of Australia and the South Sea Islands. I am informed by the Revd. Father Hoffmann, S. J., that there are more than one hundred words in Mundari which are pure Chinese. Among these are several of the numerals. In more recent times, comparatively, they were found in Behar, and it is believed that on wandering thence they at last found themselves on the Chota Nagpur plateau, where they seem to have been the first settlers. It is difficult to say how long they have been settled on the plateau, but probably they came hither before the Christian era. They now chiefly occupy the southern and south-eastern portions of the district of Ranchi. In physique they are short, and their skins are darker in colour than that of any other people on the plateau. As children they may occasionally have some pretensions to good looks, but these are practically never present in adult life in either sex. Their diet is universal and they eat all kinds of flesh including that of rats and snakes. They also eat certain insects. Their cattle are all used for ploughing. Consequently the cows are seldom milked and it is probably only at the seasons when little or no ploughing is being carried on that cow's milk is used to any extent as a food. In fact, if a woman dies leaving a small infant it is only in a very small percentage of cases that the child has any chance of surviving. Average height and weight of 100 Munda prisoners. Food at home, daily quantity and kind of animal food taken. Height 225 As they seldom own any land they are dependent on the villagers, who bring them the cotton grown by themselves. They consider themselves to be Hindus and will not eat or intermarry with Mundas or Pators. They do not eat the flesh of cows, buffaloes or pig, but goats' flesh is their staple diet, and, as it is difficult for them to keep goats as they have little or no land of their own, they have developed into a caste of professional thieves, the principal thing stolen by them being goats which they promptly eat. The Revd. Father Hoffmann, S.J., from whom my information about these people is derived, tells me that they live on goats' flesh which is nearly all of it stolen. Average height and weight of 100 Sawansis. Food taken by them. Height - 5-3" Rice and dal in both the meals. Quantity and time of food same as Pator and Munda. They also take fish, meat, mutton, and fowls. Weight 226 Their diet in their native conditions is practically anything that they can catch including jackals, snakes, lizards and insects. At their feasts they consume large quantities of buffalo meat. They always eat meat when they can get it and are specially fond of pork. They are clean in their persons and fond of personal adornment with beads, coins and necklaces made of grass and seeds and other things. The females are all tattooed in childhood with threeCHART I.
