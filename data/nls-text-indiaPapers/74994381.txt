PREFACE. THE late Surgeon-Major Bryden had, in 1880, commenced the compilation of the Statistics of the European Army of India for the ten-year period 1870-79, when, in consequence of failing health, he was compelled to go to England on sick leave. On his departure from India he hoped, after spending a few months at home, to return with renewed strength, to finish this work, and to continue his other duties. Unfortunately for science in general, and for Epidemio- logical Science in India in particular, his hopes were not realized, for the disease from which he was suffering increased, and he died in November 1880. As it has fallen to my lot to take Surgeon-Major Bryden's place as Statistical Officer, I have, to the best of my ability, completed the tables which he commenced. They contain the aggregate of the Statistics of the European Army of India for the years 1870-79, and are compiled on exactly the same plan as the tables which were published in 1873, giving the statistics of the European Army of the Bengal Presidency for the ten-year period 1860-69. In the following introductory pages the experience of the Army of the Bengal Presidency, and of the Army of India as a whole, during the ten years 1870-79, is compared with that of the preceding ten years. The principal diseases which contributed to make up the sickness and mortality of the Army during these ten years are also shortly commented on, and the effect which age and length of Indian service have on the health of the European soldier in this country is illustrated by means of a few special tables.

REPORT ON THE SICKNESS AND MORTALITY OF THE EUROPEAN ARMY OF INDIA DURING THE TEN-YEAR PERIOD 1870-79. Summary of the vital statistics of the Army of India from 1870 to 1879. THE average strength of the European Army of India for the ten years 1870-79 was 57,742. During this period there were 851,564 admissions into hospi- tal; the average number daily sick was 3,472, and the number of deaths 11,166, giving an average annual admission-rate of 1474.8, a daily sick-rate of 60.1, and a death-rate of 19.34 per 1,000. There are no statistics in this Office of the Army of India previous to 1870, so that the health of the European Army as a whole during the period 1870-79 cannot be compared with that of the preceding ten-year period. Summary of the vital statistics of the Bengal Army from 1870 to 1879. 2. During the ten years 1860-69 the average death-rate of the European Army of the Bengal Presidency was 29.98 per 1,000. In the succeeding ten years 1870-79 (including the casualties in Af- ghanistan in 1878 and 1879), the mortality in that Presidency fell to 21.00 per 1,0002 REPORT ON THE SICKNESS AND MORTALITY OF THE EUROPEAN ARMY Statement contrasting the sickness and mortality of the European Troops in the different provincial areas of the Bengal Presidency during the ten-year periods 1860-69 and 1870-79.

Decrease in the admission and death-rates greater in some provincial areas than in others. 5. Although the mortality has fallen in all the provincial areas,the diminu- tion has been much greater in some than in others. With the exception of the hill stations, the death and daily sick-rates in the Punjab during the period 1860-69 were lower than in any of the other pro- vincial areas, and only two provinces had a lower admission-rate. During the last ten-year period, on the other hand, the Punjab had the highest admission and death-rates, and, next to the Gangetic Provinces and Oudh, it had the highest daily sick-rate. Bengal Proper, again, which, during the period 1860-69, had, next to Agra and Central India, the highest death-rate, during the period 1870-79 had a very much lower death-rate than any of the other provincial areas in the plains. This death-rate was indeed but little in excess of that in the hill stations. Its daily sick and admission-rates were also lower than those of the other provinces in the plains. This diminution in the sickness and mortality among the troops in Bengal Proper is principally due to the great im- provement that has taken place in the health of the men stationed at Fort Wil- liam. Nearly one-half of the European troops of Bengal Proper are cantoned in that fortress, and there the average death-rate has fallen from 25.19 to 10.78 per 1,000. The health of the troops stationed in Dum-Dum and Barrackpore has also, however, considerably improved during the last ten years. The troops stationed in Agra and Central India have also enjoyed much better health during the ten years 1870-79 than they did during the former ten-year period. The death-rate of that provincial area is not half so high as it was during 1860-69, and the admission and daily sick-rates have also fallen very consider- ably. In the Gangetic Provinces, in Oudh, and also in Meerut and Rohilcund, a marked improvement has taken place, but not in the same proportion as in Bengal Proper and in Agra and Central India. Diminution in the death-rate in the Bengal Pre- sidency not gradual from year to year. 6. Although the average mortality of the Bengal Presidency for the ten- year period 1870-79 is much less than that for the ten-year period immediately pre- ceding it, the improvement has not been gradual from year to year. The death-rate of 1879, the highest of any year during the period, was 44.15 per 1,000. This high mortality was partly due to the severe epidemic of cholera which in that year caused a mortality of 16.18 per 1,000, and partly to the excessive mortality that occurred among the troops in Afghanistan. During that year 9,500 of the men belonging to the Bengal Army were on active service in

In it the death-rate rose to 27.45 per 1,000, but in that year the mortality from cholera alone was 10.66 per 1,000.

During the ten years under review, 24.31 per cent. of the admissions among the European troops occurred in May, not a single case having occurred in March and April. The cholera of the monsoon season is, however, the principal cholera of the year. In July, August and September there were 105 admissions, or 58.02 per cent. of the total for the year.

Taking the Army of India as a whole, there are seen to be two maxima12 REPORT ON THE SICKNESS AND MORTALITY OF THE EUROPEAN ARMY with the periods of greatest heat, that it is more than probable that the enteric fever and the heat maxima are connected with each other. In the plains of Northern India and in the Deccan, the months of greatest heat are June, before the rains commence, and September, after the rains cease; May, June and September are the months of greatest prevalence of enteric fever in these provinces. In the hill stations of Bengal the greatest heat occurs in the end of June and the beginning of July, just before the rains commence, and enteric fever has its maximum death-rate in the hills in July and August. Southern India, again, is so near the equator, that the temperature remains very nearly the same throughout the year, and in that provincial area enteric fever has no distinct rise and fall.

There were 74 deaths among men who had served between two and three years in India, whose aggregate strength was 31,478, a death-rate of 2.35. per 1,000 The death-rate from enteric fever among men between three and four years' Indian service was 1.80; among those from four to seven years' service it was.88; and among those of seven years' service and upwards it was.31 per 1,000. Hence the mortality from enteric fever among men of less than one year's Indian service is much greater than the mortality from the same cause among men who have served longer in the country, and it is very much greater than the mortality among men of the age of 20 to 24, the period of life which furnishes the greatest number of fatal cases of enteric fever as shown by the statistics of these five years. Fevers, other than enteric fever, in the Army of India and in that of Bengal. 33. There were 318,493 admissions and 818 deaths from intermittent, re- mittent and continued fevers during the ten-year period 1870-79 in the European Army of India, giving an admission-rate of 551.6, and a death-rate of 1.42 per 1,000 from these diseases. Of this number, 220,717 admissions and 631 deaths occurred in the Bengal Presidency, the admission-rate being 607.3 and the death-rate 1.74 per 1,000. These fevers are much more prevalent in the Punjab than in the other divisions of the Presid- ency; and in that Province the admission-rate from fevers as a whole has risen from 741.3 during the ten-year period 1860-69 to 969.7 per 1,000 during the ten-year period under review. The admission-rate is also greater in Meerut and Rohilcund than it was during the former ten-year period, but in the other provinces it has fallen. Fevers, other than enteric fever, in the Army of Madras. 34. In the Madras Presidency there were 29,413 admissions from fevers, excluding enteric fever, and 69 deaths during the ten-year period 1870-79, with an admission-rate of 266.5, and a death-rate of.62 per 1,000. This is less than half the admission and death-rates from the same diseases in the Bengal Presid- ency. During the ten-year period 1860-69 the admission-rate from fevers in the Madras Presidency was 236.3 per 1,000. Fevers, other than enteric fever, in the Bombay Army. 35. There were 68,363 admissions and 118 deaths from the same fevers in the Bombay Presidency during the period 1870-79, with an admission-rate of 659.9 and a death-rate of 1.14 per 1,000. The admission-rate is slightly higher than that of the Bengal Presidency from the same causes, but the death-rate is considerably less than in Bengal. During the years 1863-69 the average admission-rate from fevers in Bombay was 277.1 per 1,000. Dysentery and diarrh14 REPORT ON THE SICKNESS AND MORTALITY OF THE EUROPEAN ARMY rate from dysentery in Madras was 84.9, and from diarrhOF INDIA DURING THE TEN-YEAR PERIOD 1870-79. 15 1860-69 the admission-rate from respiratory diseases in the Bengal Presidency was 74.7, and the death-rate.99 per 1,000; so that, even excluding the Army of Afghanistan, these diseases have become more prevalent and fatal during the last ten years. The increase in the mortality is, however, entirely due to the increased death-rate from these diseases in the Punjab. In the Punjab the death-rate has risen from.89 to 1.59 per 1,000, and in all the other provincial areas of the Presidency it has fallen. But during the last ten years the ad- mission-rate from fevers has risen in the Punjab, and fallen in all the other pro- vincial areas, with the exception of Meerut and Rohilcund. It is also worthy of remark that the admission-rate from respiratory diseases has also risen in Meerut and Rohilcund, though the death-rate has fallen. These facts are brought out in the following table:16 REPORT ON THE SICKNESS AND MORTALITY OF THE EUROPEAN ARMY diminution has not been gradual, but the rate has varied very much from year to year, as may be seen from the following table:OF INDIA DURING THE TEN-YEAR PERIOD 1870-79 17 The following Table gives the admission-rates year by year from venereal diseases in the European Army of Bombay for 15 years 1865-79:18 REPORT ON THE SICKNESS AND MORTALITY OF THE EUROPEAN ARMY Excluding cholera, hepatitis was the principal cause of death in the European Army of India during the ten-year period 1870-79,13.59 per cent. of the deaths being due to that cause. Enteric fever and suicidal deaths and other deaths by violence come next on the list, causing respectively 12.59 and 11.79 per cent. of the total deaths. Next come apoplexy, dysentery and fevers, not enteric; about 9 per cent. of the total deaths being due to each of these causes. After these come heart diseases and phthisis pulmonalis, each contributing over 7 per cent. of the death-rate; and then follow respiratory diseases with a per- centage of 6.02.

The number of boys under 20 years of age, given in the foregoing tables, is comparatively small, so that the statistics are not of so much value as they would have been had the numbers been larger. As far as they go, these tables, however, show that the mortality under 20 years of age is small, and probably very much smaller than at other ages. Were these boys to be exposed to great hardships, such as are experienced on active service, the result might, however, be very different. Mortality among men over 30 years of age very high. 56. In the European Army of India as a whole (excluding boys under 20 years of age), the men from 20 to 24 years of age had the smallest death-rate during these nine years. Men from 25 to 29 years of age, however, had nearly as low a death-rate, and the great mortality was among men of 30 years of age and over. Thus it appears that there is no great increase in the mortality up to 30 years of age, but beyond that age the effect of climate begins to tell, and among men of 30 years of age and over the death-rate rapidly rises. The experience of the three Armies in this particular is the same as that of India taken as a whole; the death-rate remains comparatively low up to 30 years of age and then rapidly rises. Enteric fever the principal cause of death among young soldiers. 57. As was first shown by Dr. Bryden, the principal cause of death among young soldiers in India is enteric fever. In the Army of India, excluding cholera and deaths by violence, during the nine years 1871-79, 34.85 per cent. of the deaths among soldiers of 20 to 24 years of age resulted from enteric fever, and in the Bengal Army for the same period the percentage was as high as 36.12. Men from 25 to 29 years of age suffer to a much less extent from this disease. In the Army of India, excluding deaths from cholera and violent deaths, 15.60 per cent. of the deaths among soldiers at that period of life result- ed from enteric fever. In the Army of Bengal the percentage was 16.85, in Madras 12.09, and in Bombay 14.19. Among men of 30 years of age and over, enteric fever is an uncommon cause of death. Excluding, as before, deaths from cholera and violent deaths, only 2.69 per cent. of the deaths among soldiers of 30 years of age and over, during the nine years 1871-79, were due to enteric fever; in Bengal the percentage was 2.99, in Madras 1.36, and in Bombay 3.42. Hepatitis the principal cause of death among sol- diers over 25 years of age. 58. Excluding boys under 20 years of age, the young soldier suffers rather more from fevers, other than en- teric fever, than the older soldier, but the difference is slight.

These tables show that for the three years 1877-79, the death-rate from disease in the European Army of India among men in their first and second year's of Indian service, is greater than at any of the other three periods of service given in the tables. This is due to the excessive death-rate in the Bengal Army among men in the first and second years of their service. Up to two years' service the average death-rate in Bengal during these three years was 23.60 per 1,000; among men in their third to sixth year of Indian service the death-rate was 14.05; among men in their seventh to tenth year it was 12.90; and among men of ten years' service and over, the death-rate was 17.22 per 1,000. In the Madras Army death-rate highest among men of ten years' service and over. 61. The experience of the same three years in Madras and Bombay is different to that of Bengal. In Madras, excluding deaths from cholera and violent deaths, the death-rate among men in their seventh to tenth year was 17.19 per 1,000, and among men of ten years' service and over, 20.43 per 1,000; whereas the death-rate among men in their first and second year's service was only 13.46. In this Presidency during the three years 1877-79, the men in their third to sixth year of service had the lowest death-rate; among them it was only 10.45 per 1,000. Death-rate in Bombay also highest among men of ten years' service and over. 62. In Bombay, again, during the same three years the men under two years' service had the lowest death-rate. The rate of mortality remained nearly the same among the men from their third up to their tenth year of service; among those in their third to sixth year the death-rate, excluding cholera deaths and deaths by violence, was 11.49; and among those in their seventh to tenth year it was 10.44 per 1,000. Men of ten years' service and over suffered much more severely, the death-rate among them being 24.56 per 1,000. Enteric fever the most frequent cause of death among recent arrivals. 63. Enteric fever is by far the most frequent cause of death among soldiers in the first and second year of their Indian service. Excluding deaths from cholera and violent deaths, 34.54 per cent. of the deaths in the Army of India during the years 1877-79 among men of two years' service and under was due to enteric fever. In the Bengal Presidency the corresponding per- centage was 37.00. Among men in their third to sixth year of Indian service in the Bengal Army the percentage was 15.79; among those in their seventh to tenth year it was 11.33, and among men of 10 years' service and over, only 2.42 per cent. of the deaths was due to enteric fever. Recent arrival a more powerful pre-disposing cause of enteric fever than youth. 64. These tables seem to show that recent arrival in India plays a more important part in the pre-disposition to enteric fever than youth does. Taking the Army of Bengal, which suffers most from enteric fever, the percentage of liability to enteric fever during the years 1871-79 among boys of 20 years of age and under, was 31.14, among men of 20 to 24 years of age 42.34, among those of 25 to 29 years of age 20.92, and among those 30 years old and up- wards 5.60. Hence the liability among those under 20 years of age was very much less than among those between 20 to 24 years old, and the liability among those between 25 and 29 years of age was still considerable. On the other hand, the percentage of liability of the soldier in Bengal in the first and second years of his Indian service is as high as 68.05, whereas it falls to 17.30 among men in their third to sixth years of Indian service, and is only 11.38 among men in the seventh to tenth year of their service. The soldier in the first and second years of his Indian service falls a victim to fevers other than enteric fever, and to apoplexy more readily than the man who has passed a longer time in the country, and he also suffers very severely from dysentery and diarrh30 REPORT ON THE SICKNESS AND MORTALITY OF THE EUROPEAN ARMY Distribution according to age of the aggregate strength of the European Army of India during the nine years 1871 to 1879.

In the above tables are given the total invaliding rates and the inva- liding rates at different ages of the Euro- pean Army of India as a whole. and of the Armies of Bengal, Madras and Bombay separately during the years 1871-79. In the Army of India the invaliding rate among men of 24 years of age and under is comparatively low, being 25.33 per 1,000. The rate among men of 25 to 29 years of age is very nearly the same as that among men of the age of 30 to 34 years, being 36.86 per 1,000 among the former, and 37.59 among the latter. Among men of 35 years of age and upwards the invaliding ratio during these nine years amounted to 98.15 per 1,000. Although the amount of invaliding varies a little in the Armies of the different Presidencies, the relative amount at the different ages is nearly the same in all as in the Army of India, as a whole, except that in Bombay there is rather less invaliding among men from 30 to 34 years of age than among those of the age of 25 to 29. Palpitation the most frequent cause of invaliding among young soliders; anæmia and debility the most frequent causes among old soldiers. 66. Palpitation is the most frequent cause of invaliding among men of 24 years of age and under. The next most frequent causes are anæmia and debility, and after them hepatitis. phthisis pulmonalis, and dysentery and diarrhOF INDIA DURING THE TEN-YEAR PERIOD 1870-79. 35 Distribution by length of residence of the aggregate strength of the European Army of India during the four years 1877 to 1880.
