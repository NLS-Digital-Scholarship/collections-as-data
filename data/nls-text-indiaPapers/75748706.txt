ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Civil Veterinary Department, Bihar for the year 1936-37. CHAPTER 1. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. As Orissa was separated from the rest of the Province from 1st April 1936, this report represents the activities of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bihar, only. The nomenclature "Bihar and Orissa" has also been changed into "Bihar". I held charge of the department throughout the year and being the Head of the Department was also in administrative charge of the Bihar Veterinary College including the control of the Cattle-breeding and Dairy Farm, Patna. The work of the Central Range and the (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer was carried out under my direct control, and for one month I held complete charge of the Central Range in addition to my duties when the range officer, Mr. S. K. Sen, was on leave. 2. Daring the year I visited as many as 1-1 districts, and inspected 19 veterinary hospitals and 28 veterinary dispensaries. What specially characterised most of my tours this year was that I met the District Officers by previous arrangements and dis- cussed with them the various cattle problems of the Province. 3. In June 1936 I was deputed to Jamshedpur to inspect and study the working of the experimental Farm of the Tata Iron and Steel Company, Limited, and with Mr. C. A. Maclean, the Deputy Director of Agriculture, submitted to the Company a joint report on its future management. 4. As a member of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research I attended the two meeting of the Board held at Delhi and Simla. As a member of the Examining Board, I conducted the annual and diploma examina- tions of the Bengal Veterinary College, Calcutta, for 1936-37. I was deputed to Calcutta again where I assisted in the purchase of horses for the Moun ed Military Police, Bihar and the Police Training College, Hazaribagh. 1(a) 6 DVS
2 5. I visited Ranchi in connection with the arrival of His Excellency the Viceroy and discussed questions relating to improvement of livestock at a meeting held there. The newly started Sub-Range office at Ranchi was inspected by me. 6. At headquarters, in addition to the ordinary office work, I replied to many important references made by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research and also those arising out of the Reforms. As a member of the standing examination board I assisted the Principal, Bihar Veterinary College, in making preliminary arrangements for the annual and diploma examinations for the session 1936-37, and acted as an examiner in those examina- tions. I also acted as the President and Head Examiner of the Bihar Veterinary Examination Board for half-yearly professional examinations of the subordinate officers, interviewed and selected the stipendiary students for admission to the Bihar Veterinary College and paid frequent visits to the Patna Cattle- breeding and Dairy Farm. 7. During the year the subject improvement of livestock operations in India received an impetus from His Excellency the Viceroy and in that connection I drew up and submitted two separate schemes3 11. As a representative of the Government of Bihar he attended the 2nd meeting of the Animal Husbandry Wing of the Board of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry which was held in Madras during December 1936, and to which he sub- mitted a paper written by him on the improved methods for combating anthrax in cattle by vaccine instead of "serum". While there, he acted as a member on the livestock subjects committee, visited Coimbatore and Hosur Cattle Farms, the Imperial Dairy Institute, the Indian Institute of Science and the Mysore Government Serum Institute at Bangalore. The newly started District Cattle Improvement Committees at Purnea and Muzaffarpur were also attended by him. He was one of the judges at the Sitamarhi Cattle Fair where he deliver- ed a speech on the activities of the department. He continued to act as the President of the Bihar Veterinary Association and also as a member of the Executive Committee of the Society for Prevention of cruelty to Animals. 12. During the year Mr. Malik acted as an examiner at the annual and diploma examinations of the Bihar Veterinary College, and also at the professional examinations of the subor- dinate veterinary officers held in April and October 1936. During the floods of August 1936 he toured in the flood affected areas for over two weeks visiting Bihpur, Khagaria, Gogri, Begusarai, Hajipur, Mahnar, Darauli, Chapra, etc., and kept in touch with the local authorities. 13. During the year Mr. Malik was on tour for 164 days and travelled 3,552 miles by road in addition to the journeys performed by rail. CENTRAL RANGE. 14. Special Officer Mr. S. K. San, b.sc, m.r.c.v.s., held charge of the Central Range throughout the year except for a period of one month from the 21st May 1936 to the 20th. June, 1936 while he was on leave and the charge was held by me. Pending the appointment of an officer the newly constituted Chota Nagpur Sub-Range was also placed under Mr. Sen for twenty-six days from the 1st to the 26th of April, 1936. 15. During the year, Mr. Sen inspected all the veterinary hospitals of the Range numbering 9, and 38 veterinary dis- pensaries out of a total of 39, as well as the offices and mufassal work of all the five circle inspectors. He moreover, inspected the Mounted Military Police horses at Arrah twice, and attended an outbreak of anthrax among them, personally carrying out
4 inoculations by "serum alone" method and protecting a batch of them with equine spore vaccine. He inspected the stable and ponies of the Police Training College, Hazaribagh, and the Government livestock at the Central Jails at Bhagalpur, Gaya, Buxar and Hazaribagh and gave the Superintendents in charge necessary instructions on their feeding and management; during the floods, he visited Bhagalpur, Sahibgunj, Monghyr, Bukhliarpur and the Bariarpur Relief Camp for organising relief measures and deputing extra staff wherever necessary. He attended the meeting of the Patna District Cattle Improve- ment Association; the animal show of the Bihar Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals held at Patna and the Bihta Cattle show, acting as a judge of the animal section at both places; he also attended an outbreak of rinderpest which took a severe form in Patna town in July 1936, and represented the department at the Annual Co-operative Congress held at Bhagalpur. 16. In addition, Mr. Sen during his tours visited 372 villages in which he scrutinised fieldwork and carried on pro- paganda; interviewed many officials as well as non-official members of the local authorities with the object of increasing the strength of the subordinate staff, served as a member on the Bihar Society for Prevention of Cruetly to Animals Committee and also as Examiner and Secretary to the Bihar Veterinary Examination Board for the professional examinations. 17. Mr. Sen was on tour for 131 days and travelled 4,136 miles by road besides the journeys performed by rail. CHOTA NAGPUR SUB-RANGE. 18. This sub-range was started from the 1st April, 1936, with the three Chota Nagpur districts of Ranchi, Singhbhum and Manbhum which previously formed a part of the Orissa Range. Later in the year, another district viz., Palamau was added, and in March last arrangements were made to transfer to it the Hazaribagh district as well. This would bring the entire Chota Nagpur area of the Province under the control of one officer. The Sub-Itange was placed under Babu P. C. Bhatta- charji, G. b. v. c, appointed Assistant Director, and the office was formally opened in the Government settlement buildings at Ranchi. A serum depot has been attached to the Sub-Range office from July, 193G. 19. Babu P. C. Bhattacharji held charge of the Sub-Range from the 2nd May. 1936, till the end of the year. During the period he inspected all the veterinary hospitals and dispensaries numbering 20, 16 rural veterinary dispensaries and the office of the veterinary inspector, Chaibassa circle. He visited the Kanke
5 Agricultural Farm and attended a meeting of the Cattle Improvement Committee held at Ranchi and some outbreaks of rinderpest in the Sub-Range. He also inspected the sick horses of the Mounted Military Police at Jamshedpur and made arrangements for their treatment, etc. 20. He was on tour for 150 days and travelled 3,878 miles by road in addition to the railway journeys. 21. The office has recently been provided with electric installation. It now stands in need of a latrine and urinal for the staff, and it is also desirable to provide the staff with some Government quarters as rent of the private houses at Ranchi is high. (VETERINARY) DISEASE INVESTIGATION OFFICER. 22. Mr. L. Sahai, m.sc., m.r.c.v.s., held charge of his post as Veterinary Disease Investigation Officer, Bihar and Orissa, throughout the year. Though Orissa was separated from Bihar it was decided by Government that the Officer should function in both Provinces until his first term of five years expired as he was originally appointed for the combined Province of Bihar and Orissa. 23. During the year, Mr. Sahai served as an examiner in the subjects, Shoeing, Pathology and Bacteriology and Meat and Milk inspection at the Annual and Diploma Examinations of the Bihar Veterinary College for 1936-37, and carried out investigations on (1) Rinderpest immunisation in buffaloes, (2) Enzootic Otorrhoea, (3) Horn Cancer and (4) Fowl Diseases which were specially allotted to him by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. Over and above this programme he also investigated a number of other important diseases which were reported from time to time. The details of the work will be shown under the proper heads. 24. Mr. Sahai was on tour for 161 days and travelled 2,185 miles by road in addition to the usual railway journeys. The question of the extension of his tenure of service was gone into by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research and it was provisionally decided to extend the term by one year more from the 2nd May, 1937. CHAPTER II. Veterinary Instruction, BIHAR VETERINARY COLLEGE. 25. Charge.6 Principal and Professor of Medicine, held charge of the college throughout the year and taught medicine to the final year students. He also supervised the work of the Cattle-hreeding and Dairy Farm, Patna, and acted as a member of the Board of Examiners and the Bihar Agricultural Research Committee. 26. Teaching and Subordinate staff.7 educational qualifications, 68 students were either Matriculates or of equivalent qualification, 4 were passed I. Sc. and 1 passed I. A. Of the total number (73), 51 were private students and 22 stipend-holders, viz. Bihar Government 1, United Provinces Government 7, Bihar District Board 11, Bettiah Raj 1, Garwa Chandra Ballav Trust Fund 1 and Bengal (Mohsin Fund) 1. The details of the admissions are shown in Table I. 29. Training, examinations, hostel, etc.8 The students received training in equitation. A few out- siders also received this training at the riding class. 32. Veterinary Hospital.9 35. Altogether 56 Government Farm cattle were vaccinated by the goat tissue virus method, while 25 animals of the same farm were tested for immunity against rinderpest. 36. During the year, 1,526 specimens including blood smears, pus, fæces, urine, skin, scrapings, brain and milk, etc., were received from the districts of the Central Range and Chota Nag- pur Sub-Range, Veterinary college hospital and the Government Cattle Farm, and examined at the Laboratory, as compared with 1,043 specimens received and examined during the previous year. Out of these, diseases were diagnosed in 670 instances, vide details under head "Laboratories." Post-mortem examinations were conducted on 160 animals including 41 received from the college hospital and the Farm, while 23 interesting pathological speci- mens were mounted and sent to the college museum for preser- vation. The photo and art section prepared a number of slides of dogs and cattle, besides taking 79 photographs of Tharparkar cross-bred cows, bulls, bullocks, etc. It also prepared some ana- tomical and temperature charts and did other works of pathologi- cal and bacteriological importance for purposes of demonstration and lecture at the College. 37. The College Serum Depot.10 principal on contract was approved by Government and advertised. Arrangements were also made for filling up the post of Professor of Anatomy and Physiology which fell vacant in consequence of Mr. J. M. Lahiri's appointment at the Bengal Veterinary College. 39. Professional examination and training.11 42. During the year 3,289 outbreaks of different contagious livestock diseases were brought to notice, and in these out of a total number of 40,075 animals affected, 18,632 died, as compared with 3,264 outbreaks, 57,070 attacks and 7,923 deaths recorded in 1935.36. This is in addition to 464 deaths recorded under "equines". The figures for the Orissa districts being excluded, the statistics indicate that for practically the same number of outbreaks, the number of deaths has increased by more than ten thousands. The increase was due to greater virulence of the attacks of rinderpest and hæmorrhagic septicæmia noticed above, as well as a large number of deaths recorded under head "other causes". The decrease in the number of seizures was due to exclusion of the Orissa districts which were mostly infected with foot and mouth disease. 43. Altogether 2,995 outbreaks were attended by the staff which shows a percentage of 90.7 attendances compared with 858 of the preceding year, 1935-36. There has therefore been a distinct improvement in the number of attendances at outbreaks. 44. Statistics of livestock diseases.12 Equines. 46. Glanders and Farcy.13 54. Foot and mouth disease.14 Bihar Range except Purnea and North Bhagalpur. In that range 21 deaths from rabie9 in dogs were reported, and 15 brains from suspected cases were 6ent to the Pasteur Institute, Patna, of which 14 proved positive for negri bodies. Of the remain- ing 23 deaths from rabies, 10 were reported in the Central Range and 13 in the Chota Nagpur Sub-Range. 61. Camels.15 protected in a single district was 15,240 in Shahabad; next to that, 11,707 and 10,080 were done in Gaya and Palamau respectively. Inoculations by this method were performed in all districts of the Province. (b) Goat tissue virus method.16 70. Blackquarter.17 touring veterinary assistant surgeons for the Sadar and Deoghar subdivisions on a temporary basis. The proposals for the posts for Purnea, Muzaffarpur and Shahabad have since received the sanction of Government. The number of veterinary assistant surgeons employed in districts was reduced from 129 to 107 in consequence of the separation of Orissa. 74. During the year altogether 382,072 patients were treated by the veterinary assistant surgeons on tour as well as at head- quarters, compared with 329,785 patients treated in the year 1935-36 which shows an increase of 2,287 patients. Of the total number 17,449 animals were treated for contagious deseases, 224,060 were treated for non-contagious diseases and the remain- der, 90,563, represented castrations. In addition to these fresh patients, 30,928 old cases were also treated, and 581 animals suffering from foot and mouth disease were supplied with medi- cines. 75. According to ranges, 138,584 fresh patients were treated in the North Bihar Range, 137,549 were treated in the Central Range and 55,989 in the Chota Nagpur Sub-Range. 76. The number of villages visited by the veterinary assis- tant surgeons on tour was 46,585 as compared with 48,456 villages visited by them in the corresponding area (i.e., excluding Orissa) in 1935-36. The decrease was due to greater attention paid by the assistants to goat virus work as well as outbreaks. The details of the work done by the veterinary assistant surgeons on tour are shown in table IV. 77. Rural veterinary dispensaries.18 actually transferred being Cuttack, Puri, Sambalpur and Bargarh. The hospital at Balasore being defunct was not taken into account. Out of these the veterinary hospital, Bettiah, was maintained by the Bettiah Raj and the two hospitals at Dina- pore and Jamui continued to be in charge of the local touring veterinary assistant surgeons. 79. Construction and repair of veterinary hospitals and dispensaries.19 CHAPTER IV. BREEDING OPERATIONS. 82. Control of Livestock Improvement.20 CATTLE FARMS. Patna Cattle Breeding and Dairy Farm. 86. Staff.-21 2,000 lbs. of milk were disposed of, and 6 milch country cows giving 60 lbs. of milk per day, were undergoing experiments carried out by the Disease Investigation Officer for a fortnight. The average milk yield of the country-bred cow was 10 lbs. per head per day, while that of the Tharparkar cow was 126 lbs. An experiment of milking four times is being carried out at the Farm since the 30th August 1936, in order to see whether the milk yield is increased, and whether it affects the health of the cow. The experiment is not yet finished. 91. The total quantity of milk sold during the year was 3 64,487 lbs. 2 ozs. against 400,582 lbs. 6 ozs. in the year 1935-36, a decrease of 36,095 lbs. 4ozs. which was due to the sudden reduction in the supply of milk to the Patna Medical College Hospital. The Superintendent of the College Hospital reduced his requisition by 200 lbs. approximately per day with- out notice at a time when all the colleges and hostels were closed for the summer vacation and no other arrangement could be made for the disposal of the surplus milk for more than two months. In addition to the sale of milk, 598 lbs. 4 ozs. of cream and 215 lbs. 14 ozs. of ghee were also sold. 92. Out of the balance of 37,527 lbs. 10 ozs. of milk, 20,039 lbs. were separated for cream and ghee, 10,575 lbs. 2 ozs. either evaporated or were absorbed during the process of pasteurising, measuring and bottling, etc., and 6,325 lbs. 8 ozs. were fed to the calves, leaving a balance of 588 lbs. at the close of the year. 93. Cultivation.22 and 35 date trees were settled for a year at Rs. 498-8-0. The total amount Rs. 1,708-8-0 was realised anderedited to Govern- ment. 96. Plant and Machinery.23 were booked by rail to different places from the stations on the Sonepur district as compared with 4,298 animals booked in the year 1935-36. The increase in the traffic just noticed also indicates an increase in the demand for livestock during the year under report. CHAPTER V. Establishment. PROVINCIAL. 101. There was no change in the personnel of officers of the Provincial Veterinary Service except that the first grade Inspec- tor Babu P. C. Bhattacharji was appointed an Assistant Director in class II with effect from the 2nd May 1936. Mr. M. I. Malik was coufirmed in Clas3 I Service from 1st April 1937. Subordinate. 102. As mentioned in the annual report for 1935-36 the staff of the subordinate veterinary services was reduced by 25 officers transferred to Orissa. The Bihar cadre on 1st April 1936 there- fore, consisted of 11 veterinary inspectors, 1 laboratory assistant, 5 staff veterinary assistant surgeons, 10 reserve veterinary assistant surgeons and 113 district veterinary assistant surgeons (i.e.,26 stationary and 87 touring). This is excluding the sub- ordinate staff of the Bihar Veterinary College which remained unaffected. Due to the appointment of Babu P. C. Bhattacharji to the Provincial Veterinary Services one of the two posts of 1st grade veterinary inspectors on Rs. 200 per month fell vacant. Second grade veterinary inspector, Babu M. Agnihotri, was there- fore promoted to the first grade, while the post vacated by him, was filled by the 3rd grade inspector, Babu D. N. Mukharji. The last vacancy in the inspector's grade was filled temporarily by promoting staff veterinary assistant surgeon, Babu S. D. Narayan. Laboratory Assistant, Babu B. L. Moitra was appoint- ed to act temporarily as an inspector, vice Babu J. L. Bose granted leave. Veterinary Inspector, Babu S. R. Bagchi, con- tinued on medical leave till 28th February, 1937 after which he was invalidated by the Civil Surgeon, and applied for an invalid pension from 1st March, 1937. Maulavi S. B. Ahmed continued to act as an inspector and held charge of the Darbhanga circle till 27th February 1937, when he was granted four months' leave. Inspector Babu D. C. Guha was also granted leave for six months from the 2nd January 1937, being relieved by Babu S. D. Narayan.
24 103. During the year five casualties occurred among the subordinate staff, viz., 2 veterinary assistant surgeons P. Lall and R. R. Sahay died, and 3 others, Babu Gopi Krishna Sinha, Maulavi W. Ahmed and Babu S. R. Bagchi retired, while 11 new veterinary graduates were absorbed in the department. At the end of the year, the subordinate staff consisted of 11 veteri- nary inspectors, 5 staff veterinary assistant surgeons, 1 labo- ratory assistant, 10 reserve veterinary assistant surgeons and 121 district veterinary assistant surgeons, i.e., 27 stationary and 94 touring. The details of the staff are shown in Table VII. CHAPTER VI. LABORATORIES. 104. The laboratory at Cuttack having been transferred to the Orissa Government diagnosis of diseases was carried out at the two other laboratories at Muzaffarpur and Patna Veterinary College, and sometimes by the (Veterinary) Disease Investiga- tion Officer at his own laboratory at Patna. 105. Altogether 1,895 specimens including blood smears, pus, fæces, urine, skin, scraping, brain, milk, etc., received from the districts, the veterinary college hospital and the Cattle Farm, were examined at the laboratories mentioned above, and out of them, diseases were diagnosed in 755 instances as follows :25 CATTLE DISEASES. 107. Rinderpest.26 and a very low mortality rate which occurred at the Govern- ment Agricultural Farm, Kanke, from May to July, 1986. Some 28 animals were attacked of which 3 died and the rest recovered. The disease was at first confused with parasitic diarrhoea but diagnosis of rinderpest was confirmed by artificial transmission of the disease to two buffaloes. Control was effected through the immediate inoculation of the more susceptible animals with serum and injection of the rest with goat tissue virus a few days later. 2. Bovine Surra.27 108. In addition to the above, the (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer also diagnosed and treated a typical case of Actinomycosis in a bullock in Palamau, investigated the origin of warble fly infestation in some bullocks in Buxar on the border of the United Provinces and also in 6 Tharparkar bulls purchased from Karnal for the Government Cattle Farm, Patna, sending larvæ from all these cases to the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar, for indentification, enquired into the existence of Avitaminosis "A" in Puri district, and collected valuable information by issuing a questionnaire on Horn Cancer and enzootic otorrh28 FOWL DISEASES. 111. The officer collected valuable information regarding Doyle's diseases, investigated four outbreaks of fowl pox in Mokameh (Patna district), Sherghaty (Gaya district), Buxar (Shahabad district) and Deoghar (Santal Parganas district) and also an outbreak of fowl cholera among the fowls of the Patna Agricultural Farm. 112. Investigation and experimental treatment carried out in ranges.29 their prevention, management and care of cattle, castration of scrub bulls by the Burdizzo method, immunisation of animals against rinderpest by goat tissue virus, etc., were delivered by them at the important gatherings, viz., at fairs and shows and markets and hats, at rural veterinary dispensaries, at the middle schools and also in the interior. On many occasions lectures were also delivered with the aid of magic lanterns and with specially prepared slides, models and charts as well as with distribution of pamphlets. As the magic lantern demonstrations proved to be very instructive to the village people supply of one such lantern to each veterinary hospital was recommended to the local authority and it is hoped that the work will be greatly accelerated when these lanterns are obtained. 115.

RESOLUTION. Patna, the 21st February 1938. READ2 same number of outbreaks the number of deaths has increased by more than ten thousand. The large increase in deaths was due to the greater virulence of the attacks of rinderpest and hæmorrhagic septicæmia No case of Glanders, Farcy or Dourine was reported and there was only one death from equine anthrax and two from tetanus. 4. There were serious outbreaks of rinderpest during the year which caused considerable loss to cultivators in Ranchi and Palamau. In all there were 1,532 outbreaks of this disease, in which 16,849 animals were affected against 1,127 outbreaks and 12,092 attacks during 1935-36. The number of recorded deaths increased from 5,639 to 7,918. Of the total number of deaths, 5,152 were of cattle and 2,766 of buffaloes. Like rinderpest, hæmorrhagic septicæmia was found through- out the province and was particularly virulent in the Central Range causing high mortalities among cattle and buffaloes in Patna and Gaya. Reports of diseases by village chaukidars and other agencies continued to be satisfactory. In all 771 outbreaks of hæmorrhagic septicæmia were reported, and out of 4,476 animals attacked, 3,372 succumbed to the disease, as compared with 384 outbreaks, 2,179 attacks and 1,612 deaths recorded in the year 1935-36. Darbhanga and Purnea suffered badly from the effects of foot and mouth disease, but it is gratifying to note that only 100 deaths were recorded during the year out of a total number of 16,238 animals attacked in 720 outbreaks, as compared with 71 deaths, 41,546 attacks and 1,602 outbreaks in the previous year. 5. During the year under report as many as 504,219 animals were protected from disease as against 477,764 in 1935-36. The increase is satisfactory. The percentage of deaths of the protected animals was .08 compared with .04 of the previous year. One hundred and ninety-six equines were protected with anthrax serum and anthrax " spore " vaccine from Burma. Protection against rinderpest was given to 77,261 and 348,087 animals by the " serum alone " method and the goat tissue virus method, respectively, against 73,244 and 260,965, respectively, in the previous year. This is satis- factory considering the limited number of officers employed on this work. Protection was also given against hæmorrhagic septicæmia, anthrax and blackquarter. On the transfer of the serum depot at Cuttack to Orissa, a new serum depot to serve the Chota Nagpur Sub-Range area was opened and attached to the sub-range office at Ranchi.
3 6. In response to the appeal made by His Excellency the Viceroy, Government have drawn up the outlines of a scheme for the improvement of cattle in Bihar. But on account of the all-India campaign for improved cattle breeding, difficulty was experienced in securing an adequate supply of approved bulls. A scheme for intensive cattle breeding in selected areas is under the consideration of Government. In the meantime, the work of castrating scrub bulls as an aid to improvement of cattle continued to be done by the Veterinary Department. 104,998 bulls and bull calves were castrated during the year in addition to 206 animals under the head " equines " and 6,236 under "others". The total number of stud bulls at the end of the year was 31, all of which were the property of the local bodies. The number includes one bull presented by Mrs. Swanzy to the Patna district board. 7. The strength of the herd at the Patna cattle breeding and dairy farm was 652 against 613 on the 1st April 1936, but the total milk yield was 401,973 lbs. as against 431,008 lbs. during 1935-36. The decrease was due to the fact that the number of cows in milk was 99 against 112 during the previous year. The total quantity of milk sold was also 346,487 lbs. against 400,582 lbs. in the year 1935-36. This was mainly due to the reduced demand of the Patna General Hospital during the summer vacation when no other arrange- ment could be made for the disposal of surplus milk. 140 bighas of the farm land were leased out for a year at a rental of Rs. 1,982, but Rs. 779 only could be realised during the year. The revenue of the farm fell from Rs. 63,378 to Rs. 62,503, while the expenditure increased from Rs. 53,519 to Rs. 53,920. Government trust that adequate steps will be taken to improve the financial working of the farm. 8. In the Bihar Veterinary College the contract of one of the professors was not renewed and another professor left the college on being appointed Vice-Principal of the Bengal Veterinary College. Mr. R. T. Davis, i.v.s., Principal and Professor of Medicine, has since been granted leave prepara- tory to retirement and Major P. B. Riley has been officiating as Principal in addition to his own duties as Director, Veterinary Services, pending the appointment of a whole- time Principal. During the year, 29 new students joined the college as compared with 36 of the previous session, but the total number of students at the end of the session was 73 as against 64 in 1935-36, the number of Bihari students being 26 as against 22 in the previous year. The examination results
4 Were satisfactory. The post-graduate training class was reopened with a short course for three months. 9. Government are pleased to note the names of the offi- cers commended by the Director for good work and their thanks are due to Major Riley for the efficient administration of the department.

The charge during the former period was held by the temporary Assistant Director, Babu M. Agnihotri while that during the latter period was held by Assistant Director, Pabu P. C. Bhattacharji. 10. I visited the rural uplift centre at Brindraban, Pusa Cattle Farm, attended the Sitamarhi, Bettiah, Jaintpur and Sonepur fairs and acted as a judge at cattle shows at Sitamarhi, Bettiah and the Animal Show organised by the Society for Preven- tion of Cruelty to Animals at Muzaffarpur.

The Central Range was finally separated from the office of the Director, Veterinary Services with effect from the 1st December, 1937. Mr. S. K. Sen, b.sc., m.r.c.v.s., held charge of this range throughout the year, i. e., as special officer till the 30th November, 1937, and as Deputy Director during the remaining period. 17. During the year, Mr. Sen inspected seven veterinary hospitals, 37 veterinary dispensaries as well as all the field veterinary dispensaries (42 in all). In the course of his tours, he visited 331 villages including those in which Goat Tissue Virus vaccinations were carried out by the Subordinate staff.

Moreover, he remained in charge of a
4 severe outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease at the Government Cattle Farm, Patna. 20. He acted as an Examiner and Secretary to the Bihar Veterinary Examination Board for the half-yearly professional examinations. In addition, he served as an Examiner at the Annual and Diploma Examinations of the Bihar Veterinary College. 21. Mr. Sen was on tour for 169 days and travelled 4,352 miles by road besides the journeys performed by rail. CHOTA NAGPUR SUB-RANGE. 22. For administrative convenience the district of Hazari- bagh, which had hitherto been within the jurisdiction of the Central Range, was transferred to the Chota Nagpur Sub-Range from the 1st April, 1937, thereby the entire area of Chota Nag- pur came under one administration during the year under report. 23 Babu P. C. Bhattacharji held charge of the sub-range till the 26th December, 1937, when he was relieved by Babu M. Agnihotri who remained in charge during the rest of the year. 24. Babu P. C. Bhattacharji inspected 3 veterinary hospitals, 11 veterinary dispensaries, 13 field veterinary dispen- saries and the Tata Dairy herd at Jamshedpur. He also visited the Agricultural Farm at Kanke and acted as a member of the Board of Examiners for the training class of workers of the Rural Uplift Society, Manbhum. 25. He was on tour for 95 days and travelled 3,238 miles by road in addition to the railway journeys in course of which be visited 388 villages to scrutinise field work and carry out propa- ganda at the various important centres and interviewed officials and non-officials with a view to increasing the strength of the subordinate veterinary staff. He further delivered lectures at Ormanjhi and Silli in the Ranchi district with the help of lantern slides and charts. 26. Babu M. Agnihotri inspected 3 veterinary hospitals and 11 veterinary dispensaries in addition to 11 field veterinary dispensaries, and visited the Government Agricultural Farm, Kanke. 27. He was on tour for 44 days and travelled 1,932 miles by road in addition to the railway journeys, in course of which he visited 207 villages and discussed the activities of the depart- ment with many officials and non-officials. 28. Electrification of the Sub-range office building was completed during the year. The tiled roof of this old building leaks badly and in spite of strenuous efforts the Public Works Department have not been able to check this. The question of replacing the ceiling cloth by Asbestos as advised by that Depart- ment is under consideration.
6 (VETERINARY) DISEASE INVESTIGATION OFFICER. 29. Mr. L. Sahai, M.sc., M.R.C.V.S., held the post of (Vete- rinary) Disease Investigation Officer throughout the year. Bihar and Orissa were a combined charge up to the 1st May, 1937 after which Orissa no longer formed part of his jurisdiction. 30. He served as an Examiner in the subjects of Shoeing, Pathology and Bacteriology and Meat and Milk inspection at the Annual and Diploma Examinations of the Bihar Veterinary College for the session 1937-38 and carried out further investiga- tions on (1) Rinderpest immunisations of buffaloes with goat tissue virus, (2) Horn Cancer, (3) Equine Encephalomyelitis and (4) Doyle's disease. In addition to these, he investigated a number of other important diseases, the details of which have been shown under proper heads. 31. As a representative of this Department Mr. Sahai attended the Jubilee Session of the Indian Science Congress Association at Calcutta during January, 1938, and read the two following papers:6 from the 3rd and the 13th January, 1938 respectively. I Was a member of the Standing Examination Board for the session 1937-38 and also of the Bihar Agricultural Research Committee. In March, 1938, I was deputed to Bengal as a member of the Examining Board of the Bengal Veterinary College, Calcutta. 34.

The details of admissions are shown in Table I. 36. Training, Examinations, Hostel, etc.8 40. Mr. S. I. H. Akbari held charge of the sports section of the college as in previous years. The section was well equipped with sports requisites. Matches in hockey, football and cricket were placed with various clubs. Competitons in tennis and carrom were organised and tournaments held in the winter term. 'Davis Tennis Cup' named after the late Principal and 'Verma Memorial Cup' to commemorate a student who died in the first session of the college, together with three medals and three miniature cups were awarded to the winners and runners up by Mrs. S. Lall. A sports day for children of the staff was organised in which children residing in college area enthusiastically joined. Prize fund was raised by voluntary subscription amongst the staff and the prizes given away by the Principal. 41. One newly-admitted student joined the University Training Corps in addition to two old members. A number of students wanted to be enrolled as members but were debarred on account of the restriction limiting the membership to the "registered students of Patna University only". The members could not join the annual training camp in March 1938 owing to the Annual and Diploma Examinations in that month. They had some difficulty in attending their parades on account of the distance from the college. The students received training in equitation as in previous years but only a few outsiders joined the riding classes on payment of the fee of Rs. 10 per month. All the riding ponies maintained good condition throughout the year and were in regular work except one of the two ponies purchased in 1935 which showed mild symptoms of Equine Encephalomyelitis and could not be exercised regularly. 42. Dr. A. C. Chaudhuri remained in charge of the Hygiene section as in the previous years. Maulavi M. A. Rahim remained in charge of Anatomy and Physiology section and the work during the year was satisfactory. A horse mummy was prepared to facilitate study of superficial structures by the students. Materia Medica and Biology sections did satisfactory work under Mr. S. I. H. Akbari and Mr. M. B. Bose, respectively. VETERINARY HOSPITAL. 43. During the year under report 3,132 animals were treated at the college hospital, only 199 animals were in- patients and 68 cruelty cases against 3,565 in the previous year. In addition to this 178 operations were performed, and 140 castrations done. 275 specimens were sent to the college laboratory for examination. Six dogs were kept in the isolation ward under observation for suspected rabies and died within a week of their admission,
9 histological examinations of their brains revealed the presence of 'Negri bodies'. Anti-rabic vaccine injections were given in the case of three dogs. 38 mounted military police ponies were treated in the hospital during the year. The details of the animals treated and castrated at the college hospital are shown in Table V(A). 194 horses were shod during the period under report against 257 of the preceding year. The college farrier has been trained for shoeing bullocks and the bullock shoeing can now be undertaken at the hospital shoeing forge. The number of cows served by the stud bull at the college hospital was 28 against 48 in the preceding year. RESEARCH LABORATORY. 44. Experiments on the viability of virus in lymph gland tissue of the reacting goats have so far shown that the virus in the tissue is potent on the 6th day of preservation in thermosflask containing ice (Temperature 36-40 F). The experi- ments in connection with the survival of the virus at incubator temperature were completed during the year. The usual annual vaccination of farm animals with Goat Spleen Tissue Virus was undertaken during December and altogether 64 animals were vaccinated. No arrangement for separate camp as in previous years was made for keeping the animals under observation before and after vaccination. They were as in the field inoculations let loose after vaccination. As there were instances of complica- tions of piroplasmosis amongst the inoculated animals in previous years, arrangements were made to keep a watch on these animals but nothing untoward was observed. Doyle's Disease.10 Equine Encephalomyelitis.11 were prepared for lantern slides show case for demonstration purposes by the college artist; plain and coloured microphoto- graphs of Rhinosporidium Equi. and sections from tumours showing different stages of development were also prepared. In addition Anatomical and Physiological charts of different viscera were prepared. 45. The College Serum Depot.12 residences with one tap, were removed and ferules substituted instead to keep a check over excess expenditure of water in those residences. There is only one well near the college nursery in the college area occupied by about 200 men including sub- ordinate and menial staff and the necessity of carrying on gardening work and use of water at odd hours have been keenly felt on many occasions. Electric supply to the buildings and roads was regular. 47. Professional examination and training.13 50. A total number of 2,536 outbreaks were attended by the staff during the year. 51. Statistics of livestock diseases.14 55. Dourine.15 62. Black quarter.16 during the course of the outbreaks while only 26 deaths were recorded among the inoculated animals. The percentage of deaths among the protected animals was .005 as compared with .08 during the previous year. In addition to the above, 38 Mounted Military Police horses at Jamshedpur were protected against Anthrax by the Burma Spore Vaccine without mishaps. 70. The total inoculation figure includes 187,285 animals protected in the North Bihar Range, 158,395 in the Central Range and 128,000 in the Chota Nagpur Sub-Range. The decrease of 83,143 in the Central Range figure as compared with last year's is partly due to the transfer of Hazaribagh district to the Chota Nagpur Sub-Range during the year in which range the number of inoculations shows an increase of 30,540 over last year's figures. Details of work done in connection with the immunization of cattle will be found in table III appended to the report. 71. Rinderpest.17 Protection by this method was given both in the face of actual outbreaks as well as in their absence. The experimental work done by the (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer in this connection is detailed under head "Investigation of diseases". 73. Hæmorrhagic septicæmia.18 NUMBER OF ANIMALS TREATED. 77. During the year altogether 374,203 fresh patients were treated by the touring veterinary assistant surgeons in mofussil as well as at headquarters, compared with 332,072 patients treated in the year 1936-37. Of the total number, 15,250 cases were treated for contagious diseases and 265,453 cases for non-contagious diseases while the rest 93,500 patients represent castrations. This shows an increase of 42,131. In addition to the above, 33,404 old cases were also treated and 2,568 animals suffering from Foot and Mouth disease were supplied with medicines by the staff. 78. The touring veterinary staff visited 51,292 villages during the year as compared to 46,585 villages visited by them in the year 1936-37. The details of the work done by the veterinary assistant surgeons on tour are shown in Table IV. INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF VETERINARY DISPENSARIES. 79. The response from the local bodies to suggestions for the expansion of their veterinary activities was satisfactory during the year under report. As mentioned in the previous report, the district board of Purneah sanctioned as a temporary measure 2 posts of (3rd and 4th) touring veterinary assistant surgeons for the Sadr subdivision. Two posts of (2nd) touring veterinary assistant surgeons were also sanctioned by the district board, Shahabad, for the Sadr and Bhabua subdivisions and the District Committee, Santal Parganas, for the Sadr and Deoghar subdivisions. In addition to these, one post was sanctioned by the district board, Muzaffarpur, for the Hajipur subdivision. One of the two posts of (3rd) touring veterinary assistant surgeons, which were under consideration of the district board, Champaran, has since received the sanction of Govern- ment. The proposal for a post of (2nd) touring veterinary assistant surgeon for the Gumla subdivision was under the consideration of Ranchi district board. Although there is a big demand for this class of officers, some local bodies who have not yet provided for a 2nd touring veterinary assistant surgeon in each subdivision could not provide funds for the same due to financial stringency. The number of veterinary assistant surgeons employed in districts increased from 107 to 120 during the year. 80. Rural Veterinary Dispensaries.19 1936-37, in addition, 1,596 old cases were treated as well. The question of increasing the number of these dispensaries at important centres which are greatly appreciated by the livestock owners in view of their proximity to their villages is under consideration, but, with the very limited touring staff at present employed in the Department, it is not possible to make much headway in this direction. VETERINARY HOSPITALS. 81. There was no change in the number of veterinary hospitals which remained constant at 29 as in previous year (including the Bettiah Raj Hospital). The district boards of Patna and Monghyr expressed their inability to appoint stationary veterinary assistant surgeons, consequently the hospitals at Dinapore and Jamui remained in charge of the local touring veterinary assistant surgeons. The need for the appointment of stationary veterinary assistant surgeons at Chaibassa, Daltonganj and Sasaram was again brought to the notice of the local bodies concerned, but they could not consider the question due to financial stringency. 61. Construction and repair of veterinary hospitals and dispensaries.20 shows that advantage is being taken of the institutions by livestock owners. Of the total number of 100,395 new patients, 58,999 were treated at 14 veterinary hospitals of the North Bihar Range, 25,423 at 9 veterinary hospitals of the Central Range and 15,973 at 6 veterinary hospitals of the Chota Nagpur Sub-Range, the number of castrations performed in these ranges being 14,154, 5,594 and 2,749 respectively.

Water-supply.24 Director I attended Sitamarhi, Bettiah, Jaintpur and Sonepur fairs while temporary Deputy Director Babu P. C. Bhattacharji attended Khagra and Singheswar-asthan fairs. As usual a neat little stall with a camp veterinary hospital was erected at the Sonepur fair and placards written in different languages were shown round the mela. A cattle show organised by the Agricul- tural Department was also held at Sonepore in which I acted as one of the judges. His Excellency the Governor of Bihar graced the fair with his presence. Demonstrations with magic lanterns were given at Sonepore and other important fairs. According to the report of the District Traffic Superintendent, Bengal and North-Western Railway Co., Ltd., 7,277 bullocks, 811 cows, 248 buffaloes, 458 horses and 19 elephants or a total of 8,813 animals were booked by rail to different places from the stations on the Sonepore district. A small stall which was greatly appreciated by the visitors was put up and veterinary exhibits were demonstrated at the (Bihar Provincial) Exhibition held at Patna, Madhubani and also at Muzaffarpur on the occasion of the G. B. B. College Anniversary day. 100. Altogether 38 more important horse and cattle fairs and shows were held in the Province in which 353,498 animals con- gregated for sale as compared with 307,999 animals during 1936- 37. The general condition of the animals exhibited was satis- factory and there was a fair demand for each class of animals. The prices varied according to breeds and sizes and other qualities, etc. The details are shown in Tables XIII and XIV. CHAPTER V. LABORATORIES. 101. Diagnosis of diseases was carried out at the laboratories at Patna Veterinary College and Muzaffarpur. Altogether 4,554 specimens comprising of blood smears, pus, faeces, urine, skin scrapings, brain, milk, etc., received from the districts, the Veterinary College hospital and the Patna Cattle Farm were examined at these laboratories and of these 1,472 proved positive for the following diseases:25 INVESTIGATION OF DISEASES. 102. (a) During the year under report (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer immunized almost the entire herd of the Tata Dairy Farm against Rinderpest with Goat Tissue Virus. He also protected by the same method 166 head of village buffaloes some of which also received simultaneously with the virus a dose of anti-rinderpest serum. As a result of these inoculations taken in conjunction with past experience, it has now been possible to work out a rough table of dosage of anti-rinderpest serum (ordinary) required to counteract the possibility of severe reactions among buffaloes following this method of inoculation. Tests carried out at the Government Cattle Farm, Patna have shown that the immunity conferred by the Goat Blood Virus and Goat Tissue Virus methods of inoculation lasts for at least 2½ years. (b) Investigation was carried out during the year under report of a pathological condition affecting the horn of bullocks known as Horn Cancer. The lesion which is cauliflower-like in appearance and has invariably a history of severe injury to the horn has been found to be a squamous-celled carcinoma or epidermoid cancer in 8 cases so far examined. The disease would also seem to show a sex and species incidence as no case has so far been seen in a cow or a buffalo (of the 8 cases examined so far). The condition is a serious one as in advanced cases it often ends fatally and merits investigation, no theory is at present advanced regarding its causation. (c) Investigations into equine encephalomyelitis were continued. Three further cases of the disease (Mounted Military Police horses) were destroyed during the year under report and subjected to a thorough post-mortem-examination. The diagnosis of equine encephalomyelitis was confirmed in every case, but transmission experiments failed to confirm the presence of a filterable virus as the casual agent as previously suspected. The disease is now being studied from the biochemical point of view in collaboration with Muktesar. Hexamine treatment of affected cases has not yielded any conclusive results. (d) Trials with the subcutaneous injection of trypanblue as a prophylactic in Doyle's disease as recently advocated by a worker were carried out in several outbreaks, but the drug has not yielded satisfactory results in this Province. (e) An investigation into an outbreak of 'Jowar' poisoning near Bihar Sharif in the district of Patna was also carried out. Chemical examination of suspected samples revealed the presence of Hydrocyanic acid in every case, further work is proposed to be carried out when an opportunity occurs next. (f) Two cases of suspected Osteomalacia in buffaloes were seen near Bihar Sharif and Nawada respectively. Chemical examination of serum and of fodder revealed a definite phospho- rus deficiency as the probable etiological factor.
26 (g) Investigation into an outbreak of diarrhoea among goats in several villages near Rajgir in the district of Patna revealed that the disease was a form of acute amphistomiasis caused by Cotylophoron cotylopnorum. (h) An outbreak of a disease characterised by a protracted fever and anæmia in the latter stages among dogs belonging to the Raja Bahadur of Darbhanga, in which about 20 dogs were attacked with 10 deaths, yielded no conclusive results on investi- gation. In two cases, however, Piroplasma canis were present in the blood of the aff. cted animals and suspicion of the same infection in another two was aroused at post-mortem examination. (i) During the year under report the (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer came across a case of Rginosporiaiosis in a pony near Bargrarh in the district of Sambalpur, claimed to be the second reported case of its kind in India. ( j) The entire lot of Mounted Military Police horses were again protected against anthrax by the Burma Spore Vaccine and it is satisfactory to note that since 1935 when this method of protection was adopted there has been no case of anthrax among these horses while previously many animals were lost each year. (k) At the request of the Agricultural Department 15 bulls at the Kanke Agricultural Farm were examined for the deter- mination of their fertility. (l) At the instance of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research a note was prepared on the diseases of goats and sheep in this Province which are of importance from the export point of view. Information about the incidence of sterility, abortion, etc., among the principal Government and private-owned herds as also about warble fly was collected and supplied to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. (m) Investigations into the incidence of Johne's disease were continued. Two cases of the disease at the Hazaribagh Central Jail were destroyed and confirmed by post-mortem examination. (n) Other subjects studied included mammitis among cows, necrosis of tail in buffaloes, night blindness in up-country bullocks, etc. 103. Investigation and experimental treatment carried out in ranges.27 anæmia, and chronic bronchitis were conducted at the veterinary hospitals in districts. CHAPTER VI. Establishment. PROVINCIAL. 104. There was no change in the personnel of officers of the Provincial Veterinary Service except that the temporary Special Officer Mr. S K. Sen was absorbed in class I Veterinary Service as Deputy Director of the newly created Central Range with effect from the 1st December, 193.. Babu P. C. Bhatta- charji was confirmed in class II service from the 2nd May, 1937 and later on relieved me as ten porary Deputy Director of the North Bihar Range when I was appointed to act as Principal of the Bihar Veterinary College. As a temporary Assistant Director, Babu M. Agnihotri, held charge of the Chota Nagpur Sub-Range against this vacancy and of the North Bihar Range for 2 months and 3 days from the 2nd August, 1937 as well when I officiated for Major Riley. Subordinate. 105. Excluding the subordinate staff employed at the Bihar Veterinary College on teaching and other work which remained unaffected, the cadre on the 1st April, 1937, consisted of 11 Veterinary Inspectors, 1 laboratory assistant, 5 staff veterinary assistant surgeons, 10 reserve veterinary assistant surgeons and 111 district veterinary assistant surgeons including one employed by the Bettiah Raj or a total of 138 officers. On the retirement of 1st grade veterinary inspector, Babu J. L. Bose, second grade veterinary inspector, Babu R. K. Ram, was pro- moted to the 1st grade on Rs. 200 per month and 3rd grade veterinary inspector, Babu D. C. Guha, to the 2nd grade while laboratory assistant Babu B. L. Moitra, who was acting tem- porarily as an inspector in a leave vacancy, was absorbed against the last vacancy in the inspector's grade. Staff veteri- nary Assistant Surgeon, Babu C. K. Mukherji was also appoint- ed against a similar vacancy in the 3rd grade which occurred consequent upon the confirmation of the probationary Assistant Director, Babu P. C. Bhattacharji in class II service. Reserve veterinary assistant surgeon, Babu S. D. Narain, continued to act temporarily as inspector of Motihari Circle till the end of the year. On his return from long leave, reserve veterinary assistant surgeon, Maulavi S. B. Ahmed was again appointed to act temporarily as inspector of Purneah circle, vice Babu R. K. Ram, granted leave. In addition, staff veterinary assis- tant surgeons, Maulvi S. A. Quadir and Babu P. Topno acted temporarily as veterinary inspectors of Patna and Ranchi circles respectively in short leave vacancies. Two vacancies in the staff veterinary assistant surgeons which, occurred during the year were filled by Babus P. N. Mukherji and R. N. Prasad II.
28 106. During the year five casualties occurred among the subordinate staff, viz., senior grade veterinary assistant surgeon Babu R. N. Prasad I and 1st grade veterinary assistant surgeon Maulvi M. M. Mullick died while 1st grade veterinary inspector Babu J. L Bose and senior grade veterinary assistant surgeon Maulavi Md. Azam retired; one more reserve veterinary assis- tant surgeon Maulvi Md. Muzaffar was invalidated for further service. In addition to the 1st grade veterinary inspector Babu M. Agnihotri, who was appointed temporary Assistant Director, veterinary inspector, Babu M. M. Banarji of Chaibassa circle and touring veterinary assistant surgeon Babu B. M. Prasad of Raghunathpur (district Manbhum) remained on deputation to the Patna Cattle Farm and the Imperial Veterinary he- search Institute, Muktesar, respectively, till the end of the year. As in previous year, 11 Bihar Veterinary Graduates were again recruited to the Subordinate Veterinary Service against the above vacancies as well as those occasioned by the crea- tion of 9 new posts of veterinary assistant surgeons during the year including 2 (leave) reserve veterinary assistant surgeons in addition to the 4 posts created last year which remained unfilled. At the end of the year the subordinate staff consisted of 147 officers as shown in Table VII. CHAPTER VII. 107; The total expenditure on the department during the year amounted to Rs. 7,00,695-5-2. Of this amount, a sum of Rs. 4,36,927 was met from the Provincial revenues, Rs 8,960 expended on the (Veterinary) Disease Investigation scheme was met from a grant from the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research and the balance was borne by the local bodies. The details are shown in Table XIV (A). Compared with the total Provincial Revenues, the percentage of expenditure by Government on the department, as per revised budget, amounted to .37. The total receipts of the department amounted to Rs. 1,87,522-3-11. CHAPTER VIII. GENERAL REMARKS. 108.

Preventive inoculation against the various cattle diseases was continued and a total of 474,091 animals were immunised during the year as against 504,219 in 1936-37. The decrease in the number of protected animals was due to the lesser outbreak of rinderpest. The percentage of death among the protected animals was .005 as compared with .08 during the preceding year. Sera and vaccine to the value of Rs. 40,748 were obtained from the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar, and the Branch Serum Institute, Izatnagar, for supply to different customers through the serum depots at Patna, Muzaffarpur and Ranchi. 3. The response from the local bodies to the suggestions for the expansion of their veterinary activities was satisfactory. The number of veterinary assistant surgeons employed in districts increased from 107 to 120 during the year. The number of rural veterinary dispensaries also increased from 122 to 132 during the year under report. These field veterinary dispensaries are becoming increasingly popular among cattle-owners owing to their proximity to their villages and the question of increasing their number is under consideration. The number of veterinary hospitals remained constant at 29 as in the previous year, but the number of patients treated at these veterinary hospitals was 100,395 as against 97,225 in 1936-37. This increase is satisfactory in as much as it indicates that increasing advantage is being taken of the institutions by the livestock- owners. 4. The total milk yield of the herd in the Patna cattle breeding and dairy farm was 395,272 lbs against 401,937 lbs during the previous year. The decrease in milk supply was due to a smaller number of cows remaining in milk. On the retirement of Bahu N. N. Ghosh, the permanent farm manager, a veterinary inspector has been placed in temporary charge of the farm. Steps are being taken by Government to appoint a permanent and qualified farm manager. The total revenue of the farm amounted to Rs. 62,163-14.9 and the total expenditure to Rs. 87,509-5-6.
3 5. Mr. R. T. Davis, Principal and Professor of Medicine of the Bihar Veterinary College, went on leave preparatory to retirement on the 20th May 1937 and was relieved by Major P. B. Riley. Mr. Malik has since been officiating as the Principal of the college. The post of the Professor of Anatomy and Physiology remained vacant during the year and Maulavi M. A. Rahim, assistant to the Professor of these two subjects, carried on the duties of the Professor. The question of the renewal of contract and the absorption into Class I Veterinary Service of Mr. P. G. Malkani, Research Officer and Professor of Pathology and Bacterio- logy, and Dr. A. C. Chaudhuri, Professor of Hygiene, Dietetics and Animal Breeding, is under the consideration of Government. The admission into the college marked a satisfactory progress, the number of new admission being 38 against 29 during the previous session. The percentage of passes at the annual and the diploma examinations of the college was also satisfactory. The report shows that the college is gaining in popularity. 6. Investigations into, and experimental treatment of, many diseases of livestock were carried out with satisfactory result by the Disease Investigation Officer. 7. Government are pleased to note the names of the officers commended by the Director for good work, and their thanks are due to Major Riley and Mr. Malik for the efficient administration of the Department.

The above statistics exclude the number of deathsrecorded in equines. 70. 5,144 outbreaks were attended by the staff during the year. 71. Statistics of livestock diseases.14 BOVINE. 79. Rinderpest.15 Bhagalpur and Monghyr (North) with 205 seizures hut no death. Besides this there were three deaths from Bovine Tetanus, three from Bovine rabies, three from Bovine Piroplas- mosis, 88 from Parasitic Diarrhoea and 263 from other unclassified diseases in the Central Range and Chota Nagpur Sub-Range. 86. Other causes.16 Chota Nagpur Sub-Range. Of the districts Purnea with 44,300, Champaran with 31,225 and Muzaffarpur with 28,683 inoculations deserve mention. Of this huge number protected only 125 animals died of complications that set in following inoculations. The Goat Tissue Virus method was employed both as a pro- phylactic measure and in face of actual outbreaks. The experimental work done by the (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer is shown under, "Investigation of Diseases ". 92. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.17 the year under report and in order to get over this obstacle in the way of the expansion of the Department a scheme is under preparation and will be submitted to the Government shortly for their consideration. The post of (3rd) Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in Champaran district which was sanctioned last year was filled during the year. This post has been allotted to the Bettiah subdivision and the new dispensary has been opened at Dhanaha. The post of (2nd) Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon for the Gumla Subdivision with Basia as its headquarters mentioned in the previous report was also sanc- tioned by the district board, Ranchi. In addition to this the district board, Bhagalpur, allotted funds for one post of (2nd) Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon for Supaul Subdivision. This proposal is now under the consideration of Government. The headquarters of the (2nd) Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon of Bhagalpur Sadr Subdivision was shifted from Bihariganj (Madhipura) to Sultanganj (Sadr) during the year. For the facility of work the shifting of headquarters of the Monghyr Sadr Veterinary Dispensary to Luckesarai, which is a more central place, was also sanctioned by the board. The proposal for retaining on a permanent basis both the (3rd and 4th) posts of Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons which were sanctioned by the Purnea district board on a temporary basis for the Sadr Subdivision was also placed before the board for consideration. Besides, the district board, Shahabad, promised to provide funds for an additional touring post in the district. The number of Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons employed in districts increased from 120 to 122 during the year. NUMBER OF ANIMALS TREATED. 97. During the year altogether 430,088 fresh cases were treated by Touring V eterinary Assistant Surgeons in mofussil as well as at headquarters compared with 374,203 patients treated in the year 1937-38 and 332,072 in 1936-37. Of these 29,664 cases were of contagious diseases and 306,988 of non-contagious diseases while the rest of 93,446 represent castrations. This shows a gradual increase in extension of the beneficent activi- ties of the department over previous years. In addition to the above 25,926 old cases were also treated. 98. The touring veterinary staff visited 56,066 villages during the year as compared to 51,292 villages visited by them in the year 1937-38 and 46,585 in 1936-37. The details of the work done by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons on tour are shown in Table IV. 99. Rural Field Veterinary Dispensaries.18 close of the year was 175. Of these, 75 dispensaries function in the North Bihar Range, 57 in the Central Range and 43 in the Chota Nagpur Sub-Range. Altogether 1,78,036 fresh cases including 48,013 castrations were treated at these dispensaries as compared with 143,441 fresh cases treated during 1927-38. VETERINARY HOSPITALS. 100. During the year under report the number of veteri- nary hospitals remained steady at 29 as in the previous year (including one maintained by the Bettiah Raj). The Chairman, District Board, Purnea, proposed to convert the Arraria Veteri- nary Dispensary into that of a hospital but the question had to be kept in abeyance on financial grounds. For the same reason no hospitals could be opened at Dinapore, Jamui, Daltonganj and Chaibassa. The District Board, Palamau, has, however, agreed to re-open this year the question of running a hospital at Daltonganj jointly by the board and the munici- pality, as suggested by me. 101.

19 utilitarian activities especially in the rural areas. Of the total number of 119,576 new patients, 65,870 were treated at 14 veterinary hospitals of the North Bihar Range, 40,329 at 10 veterinary hospitals of the Central Range and 13,377 at 6 veterinary hospitals of the Chota Nagpur Sub-Range, the number of castrations performed in these ranges were 14,184, 6,188 and 2,008, respectively. CHAPTER IV. BREEDING OPERATIONS. 103. Control of Live-stock improvement.20 108. Disease and disease protection.21 Five-thousand seven-hundred and thirty lbs. of buffalo milk was purchased from outside for the manufacture of butter. The outturn of butter from the buffalo milk was 271 lbs. 6 ozs. The cream before being churned is pasteurized. Out of the total quantity of 370,447½ lbs. of milk, 346,580f lbs. were sold, 7,741½ lbs. were separated for cream, 5,082f lbs. were lost in measuring and bottling and the balance 11,042½ lbs. was fed to the calves. In addition to the disposal of milk, in the manner indicated above, 544 lbs. 6 ozs. of cream, 188 lbs. of butter and 112 lbs. 10 ozs. of ghee was sold. 112. Cultivation.22 sections, (4) Milk Bottles Register, (5) Daily work Report of Mechanical Section, (6) Dairy Produce Register, (7) Disease Register, and (8) List of candi- dates for employment as daily labourers. As reported in previous years most of the Agricultural implements and machinery specially the tractor have become very old and require replacement. The Morris Light Van which was purchased in June, 1934 has worn out completely and has not been working since January, 1939. Proposals for the purchase of a tractor and a milk delivery van have been submitted to Government. The Crank shaft of the Ammonia Compressor was broken and arrangements have been made with a local firm to set it right. Most of the parts of the oil engine which were worn out have been replaced. A Mc.Cormic Deering Ensilage Cutter Type "F" was purchased at a cost of Rs. 790-6-0. A raingauge has been fixed up and a register has been opened for recording the rainfall. Two maps23 were greatly appreciated by the visitors. A stall provided at the Animal Welfare Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition, Ranchi, was highly appreciated by the live-stock owners and the judges of the Exhibition were so pleased that they awarded a first class certificate in recognition of the activities of the Department. A show was also put up at the All-India exhibition held at Bankipore under the auspices of the All-India Muslim League. In order to make these stalls more attractive to the public and also to minimise the recurring cost of their construction at each show a folding stall with a number of models of cattle sheds, silo pits, etc., was introduced during the year. 118. This stall was exhibited for the first time in the Brindaban Gandhi Seva Sangh Exhibition held in Bettiah subdivision in the beginning of the current year. According to the report of the District Traffic Superinten- dent, Bengal and North-Western Railway Company, Limited, 2,946 bullocks, 152 cows, 204 buffaloes, 176 horses and 6 elephants or a total of 3,484 animals were booked by rail to different places from the stations on the Sonepur District. The number of important horse and cattle fairs held in the Province was 24 in which 323,851 animals were brought for sale as compared with 353,498 animals during 1937-38. The attendance of animals at the Sonepur Fair was poorer as compared with previous years due to false rumours about pre- valence of Cholera in the Fair. The general condition of the animals was on the whole satisfactory and the prices thereof were fair and varied according to the breeds, sizes, etc. CHAPTER V. LABORATORIES. 119. The Bacteriological Laboratory attached to the Bihar Veterinary College, Patna, continued to examine blood smears and other materials received from the districts in the Central Range and the Chota Nagpur Sub-Range in addition to those received from the College hospital and the Government Cattle Farm, Patna, while the North Bihar Range Laboratory, Muzaffar- pur, examined those received from the districts of that range. 8 pathological specimens received from the staff of the North Bihar Range were also preserved in the Range laboratory. The number of such specimens sent from other ranges is included in the figure shown in paragraph 60. Altogether 3,351 pathological specimens including blood smears, faeces, pus, urine, skin scrapings, etc., were examined at these laboratories and of these, 1,200 proved positive for the following diseases :24 Disease 6, Fowl Pox 1, Anæmia 124, Leucocytosis 16, Mange 6, Strongylosis 480, Ascariasis 16, Cestode infestation 9, Schis- tomiasis 1, Coccidiosis 60, Miscellaneous diseases 171. The percentage of the number of diseases diagnosed was 35.8 against 32 1 of the previous year. INVESTIGATION OF DISEASES. 120. During the year under report special efforts were made to come to grips with the diseases of cattle that were of immedi- ate concern to the stock owners. They were the following :25 buffaloes with a minimum of 15 c. c. for calves and 6 c. c. per 100 lbs. body weight for milk-giving buffaloes was found to be suitable. There were indications, however, that the reactions increased in severity due to complications caused by internal parasites that are very common in low-lying and water-logged areas from October to January. It would seem necessary to find out whether a dose of anthelmentics previous to vaccina- tion will not reduce the severity of reaction and also whether the vaccination of these animals after the intensity of para- sitism is over, i.e., from February onward will control the reactions. It would therefore be desirable to continue experiments on these lines in different localities so that a safe standard for the vaccination of this class of animals can be worked out for the guidance of the subordinate district staff. (6) Enzootic otorrh26 identified. Treatment in one of the outbreaks with carbon tetrochloride was adopted, the other outbreaks had either subsided or owners refused aid. Considerable difficulty was felt in getting reports of diseases in sheep on account of the nomadic mode of life of most of the shepherds. Efforts will be continued during the coming year to gain their confidence. FOWL DISEASE. (f) During the year under report further progress was made in the investigation and diagnosis of fowl diseases in the province. Doyle's disease was diagnosed at the Government Agricultural Farm, Patna, and necessary actions were taken. As the results of further enquiry, it transpired that this disease is widespread and causes heavy mortality throughout the province. It was reported from the districts of Patna, Ranchi, Singhbhum and Bhagalpur and the diagnosis was confirmed on biological tests in the first 3 districts. Fowl pox was also reported from the districts of Patna and Hazaribagh. In Patna district, it caused considerable losses. Two types were seen, viz., Oculonasal and avian-deptherea. 121. Investigation and experimental treatment carried out in ranges.27 SUBORDINATE. 123. Excluding the subordinate staff employed at the Bihar Veterinary College and the Government Cattle Farm, Patna, on teaching and other work which remained unaffected the cadre on the 1st April, 1938 consisted of 11 Veterinary Inspectors, 1 Laboratory Assistant, 5 staff veterinary assistant Surgeons, 12 reserve veterinary assistant surgeons and 120 district veterinary Assistant surgeons including one employed by the Bettiah Raj or a total of 149 officers. 1st grade Veteri- nary Inspector Babu M. Agnihotri held the post of Assistant Director, Civil Veterinary Department, Chota Nagpur Sub- Range throughout the year. As a stop gap arrangement another 1st grade Inspector Babu R. K. Ram was appointed temporary (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer in place of Mr. Lakshmi Sahai, M. SC., M.R.C.V.S., deputed to England for training, 3rd grade veterinary Inspector Babu B. L. Moitra was confirmed in his appointment while Babu C. K. Mukherji, who was promoted to Inspector's grade on probation, reverted to the grade of Veterinary Assistant Surgeon and Maulavi S. B. Ahmed, who was officiating as veterinary Inspector at the time, was absorbed against the vacancy thus caused. Staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeon Babu B. Prassad, I was appointed to the new post of 3rd grade Veterinary Inspector created during the year. Owing to the importance of North Gangetic area from a veteri- nary point of view a new circle comprising of the North Bhagal- pur and North Monghyr Districts with Begusarai as its head- quarters has since been opened. As officiating Veterinary Ins- pector Babu S. D. Narain remained in charge of the Motihari circle throughout the year in addition to the Muzffarpur circle for four months. Reserve Veterinary Assistant Surgeon Maulavi A. U. Ahmed was appointed officiating Veterinary Inspector of Muzaffarpur circle and held that post till the end of the year. Staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeon Babu N. D. Singh of Patna Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon Babu P. Topno of Chak- radharpur and Veterinary Assistant Surgeon Babu S. B. Lal of Purnea also acted temporarily as Veterinary Inspectors in leave vacancies. Two vacancies of the Staff Veterinary Assistant Sur- geons which occurred in the North Bihar Range during the year were filled by Babu R. D. Singh and Maulavi S. M. A. Fazal. 124. Veterinary Inspector Babu M. M. Banerji and Veteri- nary Assistant Sugeon Babu B. M. Prasad, who were on deputa- tion to the Government Cattle Farm, Patna, and the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar, respectively, reverted to the Department while Veterinary Assistant Surgeon Maulavi Q. Khan of Sewan (District Saran) was deputed to the Biological Products Section, Izatnagar of the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar with effect from the 1st January, 1939. During the year 6 Bihar Veterinary Graduates were recruited to the Subordinate Veterinary Service. At the end of the year the subordinate staff consisted of 153 officers as shown in table X.

For want of accommoda- tion, as in the previous year, no post-graduate class was held during the year. The accommodation in the main hostel being inadequate, special arrangements had to be made to accommodate the increasing number of students at the College from different Provinces and States. The Government note with satisfaction the economies effected in the running expenses of the College. 3. In the beginning of the year under review, the general condition of cattle was satisfactory. But during the monsoons, the principal contagious live-stock diseases, viz., Rinderpest, Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, Blackquarter and foot and mouth disease, were reported from almost all the districts. Figures for this year show an increase over the figures of outbreaks, attacks and deaths of last year, which is due to the fact that all the principal contagious live-stock diseases except foot and mouth disease were rampant in a virulent form in the Central Range and took a heavy toll of life in spite of the prompt veterinary aid given by the staff. 4. Protection of animals continued to he given by all the known methods of prophylaxis against the common diseases, viz., Rinderpest, Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, Anthrax and Blackquarter. Altogether, 616,720 cattle were protected through inoculations in a total bovine population of 777,098 in the 1,261 villages in which the outbreaks occurred. The immunization was successful, the percentage of deaths of the immunized animals being only 04 per cent though this was high as compared with the figure of 005 per cent during the previous year. The number of inoculations was largest in the North Bihar Range. Inoculation of cattle against Rinderpest by the " Serum alone " and the increasingly popular " Goat-Tissue- Virus " methods was carried out in all the districts. The possibility of eliminating the severe reactions in the animals caused by the " Goat-Tissue-Virus " vaccinations has been under investigation. During the year, sera and vaccines to the value of Rs. 65,154-8-0 inclusive of the cost of bottles and boxes were purchased. The scheme for the manufacture of the Goat-Tissue- Virus at the Bihar Veterinary College is under the consideration of the Government. 5. As usual, the financial difficulties of the local bodies prevented the expansion of the Department to any marked extent. The number of veterinary hospitals was 29, the same as in the previous year. The number of cases treated in the hospitals, however, showed an increase of 16,117 over 1937-38
3 and of 18,786 over 1936-37. The number of touring veterinary assistant surgeons employed in districts increased from 120 to 122 during the year. The Provincial Government note with satisfaction the increase in the number of cases treated by touring veterinary assistant surgeons in the mufassil as well as headquarters. 430,008 new cases were treated by them as compared with 374,203 cases treated in the year 1937- 38 and 232,072 in 1936-37. The touring veterinary staff visited 56,066 villages as compared with 51,292, and 46,585 villages, respectively, visited by them in 1937-38 and 1936-37. During the year, 40 additional rural field veterinary dispensaries were opened at important centres. The total number of such dispensaries at the close of the year was 175. Of these, 75 are in the North Bihar Range, 57 in the Central Range, and 43 in the Chota Nagpur Sub-Range. These dispensaries continued to be popular and are doing useful work. Altogether, 178,036 new cases were treated at these dispen- saries during the year, showing an increase of 34,595 over last year. A new circle was opened in North Bihar, comprising North Bhagalpur and North Monghyr districts with headquarters at Begusarai. The Provincial Government are very pleased to receive the assurance of the Director, that this all round increase of work in his Department was mainly due to the fact that the Department is daily gaining the confidence of the public by its beneficent activities, especially in the rural areas. 6. During the year Mr. M. I. Malik supervised the work of the Cattle Breeding Farm, Patna. Babu M. M. Banarji, Veterinary Inspector, held the post of Manager up to the 3rd January 1939, after which Babu Sunder Lal held charge till the end of the year. The strength of the herd at the Farm was 571 against 652 on the 1st April 1937, but the total milk yield showed a decrease by 24,8891/2 lbs. compared with the previous year. The decrease in milk was due to an outbreak of foot and mouth disease of a virulent type which affected all the milch cows. The manufacture of butter from buffalo milk bought outside was undertaken. 213 bighas 13 cottahs and 3 dhurs of the farm land were leased out at a rental of Rs. 2,454-10-9, but out of this amount there is still a large balance of Rs. 997-9-9 to be recovered which, it is hoped, will be realised early. The total expenditure on the farm during the year was Rs. 68,901-6-6 against Rs. 87,509-5-6 during last year or a decrease in expenditure of Rs. 18,607-15-0, but the farm is still running at a deficitas the income was only Rs. 53,565-15-0, which is less by Rs. 3,000 and odd as compared with the income of the preceding year. The Provincial Government express the
4 hope that all efforts will be made to bridge this difference between the income and expenditure of the Farm and that it will be made self-supporting. 7. The Provincial Government are pleased to note names of the officers commended by the Director for good work and their thanks are also due to Mr. M. I. Malik for the efficient administration of the Department. ORDER.ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT BIHAR FOR THE YEA.R 1939-40. SUPERINTENDENT, GOVERNMENT PRINTING, BIHAR. PATNA, 1841.

Veterinary Instruction. BIHAR VETERINARY COLLEGE. 26. Charge 5 at the beginning of the session. Two newly admitted students left the College during the middle of the session, reducing the total number of students to 124. The new admissions comprised of 33 stipendiaries, viz.. Bihar Government6 pursuits and interviewing each ward separately at least twice a session and corresponding with their parents when necessary. 32. Post Graduate Class.7 Government and 15 from Kashmir) were received for the use of stipendiaries of different Governments raising the number of books for other Government, States and district board stipen- diaries to 724. Nine periodicals were subscribed during the year besides Index Veterinarius and two daily and one weekly newspapers. 40. Museum.8 47. Mounted Military Police Ponies.9 The initial dose was 30 grain of Sodi Chaulmoograte in 20 c.c. distilled water subcutaneously. This dose was gradually increased at weekly and later fortnightly intervals to 65 grains in 50 c.c. of distilled water. Each animal thus received 0 dram and 20 grains of the drug in 8 graduated doses. Both the animals were then subjected to Double Intradermal Tuberculin Test. The cow failed to react while the bullock gave a positive reaction. It was noticed that while the cow weighed only 640 lbs. the bullock was 1,220 lbs. It was, therefore, decided to give the bullock another six one dram doses fortnightly. At the end of this period the bullock failed to react to Double Intra- dermal Tuberculin Test. Examination of rectal scrapings from a clinical case of chronic diarrhoea in a she-buffalo revealed bacilli of Johne's disease. The animal also gave characteristic reaction to Double Interadermal Tuberculin Test. Abortion.10 20 Interesting pathological specimens including internal parasites, morbid tissues and diseased organs were preserved and mounted in the laboratory. 16 of these were sent to the museum and four samples of parasites were sent to Lucknow for identification. 58.

Other diseases.GRAPH SHOWING THE GRADUAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT FROM 1912-13 To 1939-40 REASONS FOR INCREASE OR DECREASE ARE DUE TO FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS AND SEPARATION OF ORISSA FROM BIHAR15 in the Ohota Nagpur Sub-Range. Purnea topped the districts with a total of 56,991, Darbhanga was second with 38,695 and Champaran followed close on with 37,096. Only 119 animals succumbed to the disease or its complications as compared with 125 during the previous year. Protection by this method was given both in the face of actual outbreaks as well as a prophylactic measure. The experimental work done by the (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer in this connection is detailed under head 'Investigation of Diseases'. 90. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.18 nary assistant surgeon for the Hazaribagh Sadr Subdivision, which was maintained by Government up to 1932 and then abolished as a measure of economy, was revived by the district board on a temporary basis for six months. The proposal for permanent retention of both the (3rd and 4th) posts of touring veterinary assistant surgeons in Purnea Sadr Subdivision was considered by the district board and it was decided to retain both the posts for one year more for the present. The post of (2nd) touring veterinary assistant surgeon for the Supaul Sub- division mentioned in the previous report was sanctioned during the year but could not be filled as the question of location of the dispensary at a suitable place remained undecided by the district board. In addition to this the district boards of Shahabad and Champaran have each promised to provide funds for one addi- tional post. The question of appointment of a (2nd) touring veterinary assistant surgeon for the Khunti Subdivision is under consideration of the district board, Ranchi. NUMBER OF ANIMALS TREATED. 95. During the year 429,847 fresh cases were treated by touring veterinary assistant surgeons both at headquarters and in mofussil as against 430,088 patients treated in the year 1938-39 and 374,203 in 1937-38. The figure 429,847 includes 21,901 cases of contagious diseases, 307,705 of non- contagious diseases and 100,241 castrations. In addition to the above 41,429 old cases continued to receive treatment. 96. The touring staff visited 58,719 villages during the year as against 56,066 villages visited by them in the year 1938-39 and 51,292 in 1937-38. Details of work done by the touring veterinary assistant surgeons are shown in Table IV. 97. Rural field veterinary dispensaries.17 VETERINARY HOSPITALS. 98. There has not been any increase in the number of veterinary hospitals and the total number remained at 29. The district board, Purnea dropped the proposal of converting the Araria veterinary dispensary into a hospital on financial grounds. The question of running a veterinary hospital at the headquarters station of Palaman district which was reopened during the year also fell through due to financial reasons. 99. Construction and Repair of Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries.18 There was no horse or donkey stallion at stud during the year. 102. Castrations.19 was only one death from the disease during the year. Imme- diate steps were taken to check the disease with success. All the Farm cattle were protected with Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and Black quarter vaccines, in the month of June, the operations were carried out under the supervision of the Veterinary Inspector, Patna Circle and 54 animals were vacci- nated with goat tissue virus against Rinderpest by the Labora- tory staff of the Bihar Veterinary College. 106. Disposal of Surplus stock.20 expenditure of Rs. 12,322-11-0 including the cost of farm yard manure. Details will be found in table XVII. 110. Trees and orchards.21 Co-operative Federation Congress (Muzaffarpur), (5) Exhibition on the occasion of the Indian National Congress (Ramgarh) and (6) the Khunti Agriculture-Horticultural and Industrial Exhi- bition. A show was also put up at the Exhibition held at Muzaffarpur on the occasion of the first Bihar Woman Indus- trial Education Conference visited by His Excellency the Governor of Bihar and Lady Stewart. At Sonepore a camp veterinary hospital was erected and placards in different langu- ages were exhibited as usual. The new type of statuettes of different breed of cow-bulls, cows, buffalo-bulls, buffaloes and bullocks were put up at the stalls at Ramgarh and Sonepore which were much appreciated by the public. A feature of the Ram- garh Exhibition which was largely visited by the rural popula- tion was that it comprised of three sections, viz., (1) Museum, (2) Dairy and (3) practical demonstration in which lectures with magic lantern were delivered, modern dairy implements, a model cattle shed, pathological and parasitological specimens were displayed and practical demonstrations on the methods of preparation of the dairy products were given. The Agriculture- Horticultural and Industrial Exhibition Committee, Khunti, awarded a first class certificate to the Department for its exhibits. According to the figures furnished by the District Traffic Superintendent, Bengal and North-Western Railway Company, Limited 9,165 animals, viz., 472 cows, 8,199 bullocks, 171 buffaloes, 314 horses, and 9 elephants were booked by rail to different places from the stations on the Sonepore District as against 3,484 of the previous year. One of the factors responsi- ble for the increased business appears to be the absence of any epidemic among livestock or human beings at the Sonepore Fair during the year. The number of important horse and cattle fairs held in the Province increased to 42 from 38 and 423,706 animals were put up for sale as compared with 323,851 during 1938-39. The general condition of the animals remained satisfactory and their prices varied between normal limits. CHAPTER V. LABORATORIES. 116. As Central Range and the Chota Nagpur Sub-Range do not possess laboratories of their own the staff of these ranges continued to send slides and other materials for examination to the laboratory attached to the Bihar Veterinary College, Patna. The number of such specimens received was 1,120, viz., 861 from Central Range and 259 from the Chota Nagpur Sub-Range. Altogether 1,772 pathological specimens, fæces, pus, urine, skin scrapings, etc., including those received from the Government Cattle Farm, Patna and the College hospital were examined at the above laboratory and 1,041 at the North Bihar Range Laboratory, Muzaffarpur, forwarded by the staff of that range making a total of 2,813. In addition 7 pathological specimens
22 were preserved at the North Bihar Range laboratory. Positive diagnosis was given in 987 cases as detailed below:23 which 'pearl bodies' were very numerous giving one the impression of a rapidly infiltrative malignant growth. The case was of epidermoid carcinoma of the horn. It was sug- gested that as this tumour develops, the core becomes proges- sively involved and the cancerous process slowly infiltrates into the sinus and in fatal cases through the parietal and squamous temporal bones into the brain. (c) Other diseases of cattle.24 affected parotid glands were submitted to the Imperial Veteri- nary Research Institute, Mukteswar and the following report was received:25 (vi) Bovine Contagious abortion.26 121.

Patna, the 1st April 1941. READ2 the Government of that Province. The revision class for students of class 'A' who failed to pass the annual examination was continued during the year. The results of the annual and diploma examinations of the College were satisfactory, though as compared with the figures of the previous year, the percentage of passes registered a decline. The system of tutorial classes was introduced during the year. No post-graduate class was held for want of accommodation. The Government note with satisfaction the further economies effected during the year in the running expenses of the College. 3. During the year under review the general condition of the cattle was on the whole satisfactory. Contagious cattle diseases like Rinderpest, Haemorrhagic Septicaemia, Foot and Mouth disease and Bovine Surra were, however, reported from almost all the districts of the Province. Black Quarter appear- ed in all the districts except Purnea and Ranchi, while Anthrax occurred in Champaran, Purnea, Palamau, Hazaribagh, Santal Parganas, Shahabad and Gaya. There were altogether 4,430 outbreaks of different contagious livestock diseases as com- pared with 5,524 in the preceding year, of which 4,330 were attended to by the staff. In these outbreaks 44,224 attacks with 18,342 deaths were recorded during the year, as against 63,574 attacks and 22,197 deaths of the previous year. During the year the staff continued their endeavours to immunize cattle by all the prescribed methods of inoculation and it is gratifying to record that as many as 691,865 animals were protected, registering an increase of 75,145 over the previous year's figure. 482,802 animals were immunized with goat tissue virus manu- factured at the Bihar Veterinary College. The immunization was quite successful, the mortality in immunized cattle being only .05 per cent though this was higher than the previous year's figure of .04 per cent. Sera and Vaccine to the value of Rs. 61,798-10-0 were purchased. 4. Mr. M. I. Malik supervised the work of the Cattle Breeding Farm, Patna, till the 10th August 1939, when Dr. A. C. Chaudhuri, B.sc, PH.D. (Edin.), Professor of Hygiene, Dietetics and Animal Breeding, Bihar Veterinary College, was placed in charge. Babu Sunder Lall worked as Manager up to the 28th January 1940, when his services were terminated and Babu M. M. Banerji, Veterinary Inspector, was appointed temporary Manager and worked as such up to the end of the year. The strength of the herd at the Farm was 592 on 1st April 1939, as compared with 571 on the corresponding date of the previous year, but the milk yield registered a decline by about 25,000 lbs.
3 which was due to the outbreak once again of a virulent type of foot and mouth disease which affected all the milch cows. The total area of Farm land under cultivation was 318 acres; 162 bighas, 10 cottahs and 3 dhurs were leased out at a rental of Rs. 2,005-7-3. While the receipts from the Farm showed sub- stantial increase, viz. Rs. 70,817 against Rs. 53,565 of the preceding year, this was almost counterbalanced by the increased expenditure of Rs. 83,791 as against Rs. 68,901 of the preceding year. It is, however, satisfactory to note that the deficit between the income and expenditure is some Rs. 2,362 less than in the previous year. The Government take this opportunity of emphasizing the need for effecting ail possible economies in expenditure on the Farm and express the hope that it will be made self-supporting at no distant date. 5. The Provincial Government are pleased to note the names of the officers commended by the Director for good work and their thanks are also due to Mr. M. I. Malik for the efficient administration of the Department. Order.
