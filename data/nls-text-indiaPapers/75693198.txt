Agents for the sale of Publications issued by the Central Provinces Government [NOTE.No. 518 369-XIV GOVERNMENT OF THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT Nagpur, the 4th October 1926. READ2 medical officer could not visit the village before it was too late for the adoption of prophylactic measures indicates the limitations under which the department at present works, the ignorance and indifference of the owners of cattle in outlying areas, the dilatoriness of village officers, the inadequate nature of communications and postal arrangements and the exten- sive area of the present charges of the Veterinary Assistants. In regard to actual treatment benefit is expected from the &quot;Serum Simultaneous&quot; method of inoculation which ensures greater immunity than the &quot;Serum Alone&quot; method and Government will watch with interest its introduction into the province. 3. The mortality from Haemorrhagic Septicaemia was also comparatively heavy despite the fact that 8,125 head of cattle, or more than double the number of the previous year, were inoculated after the disease had been microscopically confirmed in 343 cases. The disease appears almost always in a sporadic form and until the diagnosis is confirmed no preventive inoculation can be undertaken. Speedier means for the adoption of suppressive measures are under the consideration of the department. 4. The innovation of authorizing the Fair Superin- tendent to segregate cattle suffering from infectious or contagious diseases has been attended with encouraging results at the Singaji Fair in Nimar and the power might be used more freely in future. The question of the preven- tion of the spread of epizootic diseases by droves of infected cattle coming from the Native States still awaits a solution. 5. The number of castrations performed by the Burdizzo castrator has risen by over 50 per cent to 39,234 which is more than half as many as in the past five years put together. Were any further evidence needed of the popularity of this system, which is everywhere supplanting the primitive and inhumane method of castration, it would be furnished by the fact that various zamindars, malguzars and cultivators, notably in Chhattisgarh, have either singly or jointly presented several such instruments for the use of Veterinary Assistants. Government commend this example for imitation in other parts of the province.
3 6. Government notices with pleasure that local bodies are interesting themselves in veterinary matters and have provided necessary buildings and equipment. Apathy is inexcusable in regard to measures directed to prevent avoidable loss in perhaps the most important asset of this preeminently agricultural country. 7. The strength of the staff of Veterinary Assistants has remained virtually constant for the past 17 years, but the 13 vacancies that occurred during the year were all filled up by graduates of the Bengal and Madras Veterinary colleges, none of whom hailed from this province. It is regrettable that in spite of the annual offer of seven scholarships of the value of Rs. 30 per mensem tenable at the Bombay Veterinary College, there is a dearth of suitable local candidates. Out of 35 scholarships offered since 1920-21, only 11 were finally accepted by residents of the province. If the pay, prospects and travelling allowance are sufficiently lucrative to attract out- siders who have qualified at their own expense to join the department, there is no reason why qualified men bred and born in the province should not avail themselves in larger numbers of the facilities offered to seek a career in this department. 8. The laboratory continues to perform useful func- tions, and its services are in great demand. The Veterinary Adviser again comments on the need for a well equipped laboratory and research institute in which research relating to problems of local or provincial importance can be carried out to supplement the work undertaken at the Imperial Research Institute at Muktesar. 9. Government is glad to see that effective action towards the prevention of cruelty to animals has been taken in several districts. It is noticeable, however, that in none of these cases were the animals sent to the Veterinary Dispensaries for treatment. Government desires that the Deputy Commissioners should bring this omission to the notice of the Magistrates trying such cases. 10. Officers of all ranks in the department had an unusually trying time in the year under review. Government thanks Mr. Wilson for the successful administration of the
4 department and also those officers whose names have been specially brought to its notice. ORDER.No. 630/1-3. FROM C. W. WILSON, ESQ., M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., VETERINARY ADVISER TO GOVERNMENT, Central Provinces, To THE REVENUE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Central Provinces. Nagpur, the 7th July 1926. SIR, I have the honour to submit herewith the annual report of the Civil Veterinary Department for the year ending 31st March 1926. 2. I toured in the Betul, Seoni, Jubbulpore, Damoh, Mandla, Saugor, Narsinghpur, Chhindwara, Amraoti, Akola, Yeotmal, Buldana, Nagpur, Chanda and Hoshangabad districts by road marches and also by rail and inspected 43 dispensaries, namely, all the dispensaries in the Seoni, Chhindwara, Hoshangabad and Nimar districts and the dispensaries at Umrer, Chanda, Warora, Akola, Murtizapur, Buldana, Khamgaon, Malkapur, Shegaon, Amraoti, Chandur, Daryapur, Yeotmal, Darwah, Kelapur, Wun, Karanja, Mandla, Jubbulpore, Saugor, Rehli, Damoh, Narsinghpur, Betul, Multai, Raipur, Drug, Bilaspur, Janjgir and Rajnandgaon State. 3. I examined the 2nd and 4th year students of the Nagpur Agricultural College in Veterinary science during February and March 1926. I also attended the meetings of
2 the Board of Agriculture at Pusa and the examination of the final year students of the Bengal Veterinary College as President of the Board of Examiners during the months of December 1925 and March 1926 respectively. 4. Major R. F. Stirling, F.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., continued on leave throughout the year under report, having been granted by the High Commissioner for India a year's study leave in continuation of the combined leave for 9 months availed of from 6th November 1924. 5. Mr. R. V. Pillai, Temporary Second Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Central Provinces, held direct veterinary charge of the Nagpur Civil Division throughout the year, in addition to his duties in the Laboratory. He toured in Nagpur, Chanda, Bhandara and Balaghat districts by road marches and also travelled by rail and inspected all the 16 dispensaries in his charge and the slaughter-houses at Bhandara, Wardha, Chanda and Balaghat. He attended the Agricultural Cattle Shows held at Sindewahi (Chanda district), Bhandara and Adhartal farm (Jubbulpore) and conducted propaganda work. He visited the Garhi and Lohara (Ahiri Court of Wards) cattle-breeding farms and also inspected the offices of the Veterinary Inspectors, Chanda and Gondia. 6. Mr. Gouri Shankar, Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Chhattisgarh Division, toured in the 3 districts of his division and in the Rajnandgaon, Khaira- garh and Raigarh Feudatory States and inspected 13 dispensaries, twice, the State dispensaries at Rajnandgaon and Khairagarh, once, and the State dispensary at Raigarh, twice. He visited the Government cattle-breeding farms at Chand- khuri, Sarkanda and Ruabanda, the Court of Wards cattle- breeding farm at Pithora, the Khrishi Gowrakshan farm at Sakri and the malguzari cattle-breeding farm at Sarora, Raipur district. He also inspected the slaughter houses in his circle and attended the District Agricultural Shows and Exhibitions held at Raipur, Bilaspur, Drug and the show held by the American mission at Jogidongri near Pendra. He attended the meetings of the Agricultural associations held at Bemetara, Balod, Drug, Raipur and Bilaspur. 7. Mr. V. K. Vairagkar, Deputy Superintendent, held charge of the Berar Division up to 15th June 1925, when he proceeded on combined leave for 11 months and 29 days preparatory to retirement. He toured in the Akola, Yeotmal
3 and Buldana districts and inspected 11 dispensaries once, i.e., all the dispensaries in the Buldana district, except Shegaon, and the dispensaries at Patur, Basim, Pusad and Umerkhed. Mr. Mohammed Abdul Quadir was transferred from Jubbulpore Division to the charge of the Berar Division which he took over on 15th June 1925. While in charge of Jubbulpore Division he toured in the Mandla district, inspected the dispensaries at Dindori and Shahpura once and visited the Panagar cattle market. He toured in the 4 districts of Berar and inspected 7 dispensaries, twice, and 24 dispensaries, once, i.e., all the 31 dispensaries in the Amraoti, Akola, Buldana and Yeotmal districts. He inspected the offices of the Veterinary Inspectors, Akola, Amraoti and Buldana. 8. The sanctioned post of Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Nerbudda Division, was filled up during the year, with the approval of the Local Govern- ment, and Mr. D. M. Swamy, Senior Veterinary Inspector, Nerbudda Division, was promoted to the Deputy Superin- tendent's grade and held charge of the division from 1st April 1925 onwards. He toured in the 5 districts of his charge and inspected all the 15 dispensaries in his division twice and seven important slaughter-houses. He attended the Agricultural exhibition held at the Powarkheda farm and the Singaji fair and organized propaganda work. He carried out the technique of protective inoculation for blackquarter by the latest methods in 34 head of cattle at Nawapur village in Bhainsdehi tahsil with satisfactory results He also inspected the offices of the Veterinary Inspectors, Nerbudda Division and Nimar district. 9. Mr. Rahim Bux, Senior Veterinary Inspector, was promoted to the Deputy Superintendent's grade and took over charge of the Jubbulpore Division from Mr. Abdul Quadir, on the latter's transfer to Berar Division on 6th June 1925, and held charge throughout the year. He toured in the Jubbulpore, Damoh, Saugor and Mandla districts and inspected the 13 dispensaries in his division; I, thrice, 10, twice, and two dispensaries, once. He attended the District Agricultural Exhibition held at Adhartal farm, Jubbulpore, and inspected the offices of the Veterinary Inspectors, Seoni and Saugor, and the slaughter-houses at Saugor, Khurai, Damoh, Jubbulpore and Mandla.
4 10. Mr. J. M. Bhatt, Veterinary Inspector, Drug, was appointed as Officiating Deputy Superintendent vice Mr. R. V. Pillai (on other duty) and was attached to the Laboratory from 1st June 1925. He visited the Ramtek dispensary and toured in the Ramtek tahsil in order to conduct an enquiry. 11. The touring work performed by the gazetted officers of the department is tabulated below:5 were promoted to higher classes, respectively; of the remain- ing 2 students in the 1st year, 1 left the College owing to failure of health and one could not appear at the annual promotion examination owing to ill-health. 14. Compounders' class.6 18. The total positive findings were 6,471 thereby necessitating the issue of 2,601 special reports for the guidance of field staff:7 B.8 2.9 26. Anthrax occurred sporadically in Betul, Nimar, Amraoti, Balaghat, Wardha, Seoni and Mandla districts, while Akola, Buldana, Hoshangabad, Chhindwara and Narsinghpur districts were free from this infection. It prevailed in a mild form in the Jubbulpore district but nevertheless it caused deaths amongst 245 animals. 174 reports were received but in only 16 instances was the disease microscopically con- firmed. 500 animals received Anti-Anthrax inoculation as most of the cases occurred sporadically. To supply correct information upon the incidence of this disease and to make the public aware of the grave dangers attendant on the impro- per disposal of beasts dead of Anthrax is ever uppermost in the minds of the officials of this department. For, the spores of Anthrax bacilli have been known to lie dormant in an infected soil for years and then exalt themselves and cause formidable outbreaks. Every endeavour was made to en- lighten the villagers regarding the correct methods for the dis- posal of carcasses and the risk human beings run in the care- less handling of carcasses of Anthrax. 27. It is generally conceded that one of the main sources of Anthrax infection of human beings is in the trade of hides of infected animals. The so called East India hide, a great percentage of which is really Indian hide, has an unpopularity in the Western markets on this score and the matter has of late assumed international importance to the detriment of hide trade of this vast country by reason of the menace it holds for the workmen handling them. From a humanitarian point of view one can only laud any genuine efforts to combat this evil and to remove the bad name acquired by merchants who exploit the Indian villages. From an economic point of view such a bad name must operate adversely on the trade. 28. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.10 Raipur district, while Bilaspur, Drug and Jubbulpore suffered in proportion. In 343 instances the disease was microscopi- cally confirmed. 8,124 animals received protective inocula- tion against 4,050 of the preceding year. 29. The disease appeared in sheep and goats in Buldana, Amraoti, Bhandara and Damoh districts and the migratory habits of these animals are responsible for simultaneous outbreaks among Bovines in the neighbourhood. Thirteen cases of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia in goats were microscopically confirmed and 159 animals received Anti- Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia inoculation. 30. A matter which has come under consideration is, how can one best use the resources of the Department for the organization of a speedier method of accurate diagnosis of this disease without risking a set-back inevitable when diagno- sis is based solely on microscopic appearances. The close similarity of symptoms presented by the disease, isolated out- breaks in a large tract which has to be covered by one Veterinary Assistant and want of facilities in certain dispen- saries for stocking the required Anti-Serum in sufficient quantity, on the off chance of its being required at any one time, all contribute to suppressive measures not having been so speedily carried out as circumstances would warrant. Arrangements will be made as soon as practicable to remedy this defect. 31. Blackquarter.11 known under the pseudonym &quot;Blackquarter&quot; we have more than one etiological factor to deal with and further that that factor may vary according to the locality. The products now available for its suppression are considered efficacious enough to suppress all such infections as are included in the common name &quot;Blackquarter&quot;. 34. Piroplasmosis.12 Of the brains of two dogs sent to Kasauli, the one from Akola was confirmed for Rabies while that from Chhindwara was negative. 39. Eleven valuable dogs received Anti-Rabic treatment in the Nagpur Veterinary dispensary and only in one case was the treatment reported ineffective. 40. Fowl Cholera.13 46. As the work at the Rajnandgaon State Dispensary has considerably improved on account of its being under departmental control, the Khairagarh and Raigarh State Veterinary Dispensaries were, at the, instance of the Political Agent, Chhattisgarh Feudatory States, periodically visited by the Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Chhattisgarh Division. 47. Buildings.14 55. As the Local Government sanctioned a grant of Rs. 10,000 for the construction of human dispensary build- ings at Morsi, the Amraoti District Council decided that when the new buildings are ready the present human dis- pensary buildings should be utilized for the Morsi Veterinary Dispensary. 56. The Akola District Council resolved to open a new dispensary at Risod and provided funds for its maintenance. Steps are being taken to provide suitable accommodation for the dispensary. A Veterinary Assistant will be placed in charge of the dispensary early in the current year. 57. The number of cases treated by Veterinary In- spectors and Assistants on tour was 383,730 including 35,842 castrations as against 351,673 including 23,812 castra- tions in the previous year. The number of cases treated at dispensaries was 111,958 including 3,392 castrations as against 108,326 including 2,408 castrations in the past year. The moffussil cases, i.e., those supplied with medicines but not brought to the dispensaries, were 180,499 as against 158,746 in the previous year. III.15 assistants to cope with the demand of agriculturists for this method in preference to the cruel process of mulling or the surgical method of incision. 60. Fairs and shows.16 64. Mr. Gouri Shankar worked well and maintained the efficiency of the department in the Chhattisgarh Division. 65. Messrs. V. K. Vairagkar and Mahomed Abdul Quadir tackled their arduous duties well and maintained the efficiency of the department in Berar where the work is on the increase. 66. Messrs. Mahomed Abdul Quadir and Rahim Bux worked well and did their best to forward the work of the department in the Jubbulpore Division. 67. A new Veterinary Division for the Nerbudda Divi- sion was formed at Hoshangabad with effect from 1st April 1925. Mr. D. M. Swamy, Senior Veterinary Inspector, who was appointed as Deputy Superintendent of that Division with effect from the same date, worked well and maintained the efficiency of the department. 68. Mr. J. M. Bhatt, a Senior Veterinary Inspector, who was appointed as Officiating Deputy Superintendent attached to Laboratory vice Mr. R. V. Pillai on other duty, worked hard and tried to cope with the heavy work in the Laboratory. 69. Subordinate staff.17 received and dealt with works out at 118. This is a slight increase on what was thought to be the record figure of last year. It gives at any rate a substantial proof of the demands which could only be met in a decently equipped laboratory and efficiently staffed. 293,455 doses of sera and vaccines were issued to the staff for the suppression of contagious diseases in the field. Recent orders have necessitated keep- ing an account of the packing cases and standard bottles in order to save expenditure under this head. This means an increase in the routine work of the clerical staff. 139,210 cubic centimeters of sterile trypan blue solution were prepared and despatched from the Laboratory for treatment of Piroplasmosis in animals. 72. 2,136 dozen slides and several dozen pipettes were distributed for the collection and despatch of morbid material. 73. The examination of samples of urine, faeces, milk, and pathological tissues for detection of diseased conditions require elaborate processes and strict accuracy and so take up considerable time. 74. The condition in cattle commonly classified as seasonal diarrh18 set purpose. For instance, some evidence is forthcoming as to prevalence of contagious abortion in certain breeding establishments in the Province. This requires to be thoroughly investigated before the disease gets established in the Province. 78. The serum Simultaneous method of inoculation for the suppression of Rinderpest has to be introduced in the moffussil as a means of giving the inoculated animals a more lasting immunity than is possible by the Serum Alone method now practised. The introduction of this method in the Central Provinces requires certain preliminary tests to be conducted and a depôt for the supply of virulent material. It should be adopted slowly and with the greatest caution. 79. The cure of Bovine and Canine Surra is another problem to be taken up in order to remove once for all these perpetual sources of danger for equines as at present they can only be dealt with under the Glanders and Farcy Act. 80. Furthermore to carry out the directions of an expert in a scientific manner in the field requires more than average intelligence and skill on the part of the assistants and this has to be imparted by post-graduate teaching. This has to be arranged at Nagpur for the benefit of the sub- ordinate staff only when facilities are available. These and other matters should necessarily await the building of a Veterinary Institute at Nagpur and placing the same under a whole-time officer trained for this work. 81. The practice of placing recruits for preliminary training under the Deputy Superintendent, in laboratory technique again obtained throughout the year. These pro- bationers also gained insight in the methods employed in the investigation of diseases affecting domesticated animals. Some of the Veterinary Inspectors notably the Veterinary Inspectors, Seoni and Buldana, trained the assistants in their circles in the new method of castration by the Burdizzo castrator. 82. Agricultural College.19 Veterinary Assistants. This advance will be of the greatest benefit to the cultivators and when these posts are filled up in the current and ensuing years the pressing needs of the public will have, in some measure, been met. 84. Reporting of outbreaks of cattle disease has considerably improved all over the province due to the vigil- ance of the Revenue authorities in enforcing orders already issued to village officials and delinquents were suitably dealt with on the matter being reported to district officers. 85. Opposition to inoculation and Western methods of treatment and castration of inferior bulls is still met with in certain backward rural tracts, but it is hoped that it will die out in due course by constant advice tendered and missionary work undertaken by the staff. 86. The reasons for inability to completely attend the outbreak reports received at the Rajnandgaon State Dispensary and in the Bilaspur district are (1) the unwieldy area of each assistant's jurisdiction, (2) simultaneous receipt of reports and (3) difficult touring conditions which obtain in the Chhattis- garh Division. Proposals have been set on foot for the opening of about 6 new dispensaries in the Chhattisgarh Division and when these are started it is hoped that the work will be within manageable limits. 87. During the year 35 sanads were awarded to the public for rendering help to the staff in carrying out inoculations and castrations. 88. An article on &quot;Poisoning by Gumchi or Suis (needles)&quot; by Major R. F. Stirling, F.R.C.V.S., and an article on &quot;A20 again brought to the notice of Government for such action as is deemed fit so that the owners may not get off lightly for grave offence of cruelty.

REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT OF THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AND BERAR During the year 1926-27
Agents for the sale of Publications issued by the Central Provinces Government. [NOTE.No. 867-767-XIV. GOVERNMENT OF THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT Nagpur, the 13th December 1927. READ2 serum-simultaneous method the results would unquest ionably have been even better. It is unfortunate that the expansion of this method of treatment should be hampered by want of funds as the longer period of immunity which it confers is an extremely valuable factor in arresting the spread of this disease. 2.There are many indications of the steadily growing popularity of the department. Resistance to inoculation on the part of ignorant owners of cattle is rapidly disappearing. Several enlightened landowners have presented instruments for castration by the Burdizzo method and in Chhattisgarh, where the poor quality of the cattle has long been a source of concern to the local Government, no less than four new dispensaries were constructed during the year. There is no question but that the personal influence of officers of the department is now the most important factor in achieving progress, particularly in the more backward tracts; and the local Government has not failed to note that the progress made in Chhattisgarh coincides with a record of touring by the Deputy Superintendent R. S. Gouri Shankar Shrivastava which easily eclipses the record of any other officer of the department. 3.The fear expressed by the Veterinary Adviser to Government that the practice of sending to Veterinary Dispensaries for treatment animals seized by officers of the S. P. C. A. is likely to endanger the popularity of a dispensary does not appear to have much foundation. The number of animals sent in this way to a dispensary is not large and in no way concerns persons who voluntarily take animals for treat- ment. At the same time the local Government agrees that the Veterinary Department is the best judge of whether an animal requires to be retained for treatment. 4.In spite of the progress made by the department, much still remains to be done. The immensity of the problem can be gauged from the fact that in a province with an area of 131,000 square miles and a cattle population of 12,253,335 there are still only 93 Veterinary Dispensaries and 131 Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeons, whose efforts are nowhere supple- mented by private practitioners. Expansion must be largely a matter of local initiative in raising the funds necessary for the construction of dispensaries.
3 5.A long standing need of the department is better training in every branch of the service. For the higher ranks there is at present no training available in India of a standard which would enable them to fill the place of the present Imperial service; whilst in the lower ranks the local Govern- ment regrets to observe not only that assistant surgeons already in service refused to avall themselves of the opportunity of further study, but that the province could only supply 2 out of the 14 new assistant surgeons recruited during the year, and the scholarships for training which carry with them a practical certainty of employment by Government were not all taken up. Research which is the foundation of progress in veterinary treatment must necessarily remain at a stand-still so long as these conditions prevail. 6.Another problem of the greatest magnitude is the prevention of the spread of epizootic diseases. Of the two main sources of infection, cattle fairs and imported herds, the former is to some degree susceptible of control, but for dealing with the latter no scheme has yet been evolved. The department has conclusively traced the widespread havoc caused by the passage of infected animals through the province and it can hardly be doubted that the cost of quarantine camps on our borders would be more than repaid by the saving of lives that would result. Until, however, public opinion can be certainly enlisted in support of such a measure it would be useless to attempt its enforcement. It may be long before the agricultural population accepts the implications of the doctrine that prevention is better than cure, and learns to co-operate readily with the department in banning the outsider who brings disease into the province; and the only method of securing that co-operation is to educate it to understand the benefits to themselves arising from it. It is to be hoped that the Veterinary Department will come in for a share of the increasing attention that is being paid to propaganda by the Departments of Agriculture and Co- operative Credit, with which its own interests are naturally linked. There is ample work for the department in the accumulation of evidence of the spread of disease and in its reduction to a form which will permit of ocular demonstration and so reach the illiterate masses, and the local Government trusts that this important work will not be forgotten amongst the many ardous duties which the officers of the department are more immediately called upon to perform.
4 7. The local Government desires to record its apprecia- tion of the services rendered by Mr. Wilson as head of the department, and by the other officers specially mentioned by him in his report. ORDER.No. 607/1-3 FROM C. W ILSON, ESQ., M.r.C.V.S., I.V.S., VETERINARY ADVISER TO GOVERNMENT, Central Provinces, To THE REVENUE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Central Provinces. Nagpur, the 6th July 1927. SIR, I have the honour to submit herewith the annual report of the Civil Veterinary Department for the year ending the 31st March 1927. 2. I toured in the Seoni, Chhindwara, Betul, Hoshang- abad, Damoh, Saugor and Narsinghpur districts by road marches and also by rail and inspected 24 dispensaries, namely, all the dispensaries in the Jubbulpore, Damoh, Betul, Hoshangabad, Seoni and Chhindwara districts and the dis- pensaries at Saugor, Rehli, Drug, Raipur, Bilaspur, Narsingh- pur and Khandwa. The dispensary at Chhindwara was in- spected thrice, the dispensaries at Jubbulpore, Narsinghpur and Seoni twice, and the rest once. 3. I gave evidence before the Royal Commission on Agriculture at Nagpur in January 1927, and attended the examination of the final year students of the Bengal Veteri- nary College, acting as President of the Board of Examiners, during the month of February 1927. I also examined the 2nd and 4th year students of the Nagpur Agricultural College in Veterinary Science during March 1927.

He toured in the Wardha, Bhandara and Balaghat districts by road marches and also travelled by rail and inspected the six dispensaries at Sakoli, Arvi, Gondia, Bhandara, Balaghat, Wardha and the slaughter-houses at the four latter places. He was on six months' leave from the 1st August 1926 to the 31st January 1927, and on his return to duty on the 1st February 1927 he was appointed by the local Government as Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Nagpur Civil Division, and has been working in that capacity. 6. Rai Sahib Gouri Shanker Shrivastava, Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Chhattisgarh Division, toured in the three districts of his division and in the Rajnandgaon, Khairagarh and Raigarh Feudatory States and inspected 20 dispensaries including the State dispensaries at Rajnandgaon, Khairagarh and Raigarh, 15 dispensaries twice, one dispensary thrice and four dispensaries once. He visited the Government cattle-breeding farms at Chandkhuri, Sarkanda and Ruabanda, the Court of Wards cattle-breeding farms at Pithora and Thakurtola, the Zamindari cattle-breeding farms at Tarbod and Mohalla, the Krishi Gowrakshini farm at Sakri and the malguzari cattle-breeding farms of Sarora and Raikhera. He inspected the slaughter-houses for goats at Raipur, Dhamtari, Baloda Bazar, Bilaspur, Mungeli and Drug and for cattle at Raipur and Bilaspur and attended the District Agricultural and Cattle Shows held at Baloda Bazar, Pithora, Mungeli and Bemetara. He attended the meetings of the agricultural associations held at Pithora, Baloda Bazar, Mungeli and Bemetara.
3 7. Mr. Mohammad Abdul Quadir, Deputy Superintend- ent, Civil Veterinary Department, Berar Division, held charge of the Berar Division during the year except for the period from the 18th December 1926 to the 19th March 1927 during which time he was on leave He toured in the Amraoti, Akola and Buldana districts and inspected 15 dispensaries once, i.e., all the dispensaries in the Buldana district and the dispensaries at Anjangaon Surji, Dharni, Ellichpur, Akola, Akot, Balapur and Basim and also inspected the dispensaries at Amraoti City, Amraoti Camp, Morsi, Ellichpur, Chikalda, Anjangaon Surji, Balapur and Patur in company with the Second Super- intendent, Civil Veterinary Department. Mr. Kashi Prasad, Senior Veterinary Inspector, who officiated as Deputy Superintendent, Berar Division, from the 8th January 1927 to the 19th March 1927, inspected the seven dispensaries situated in Amraoti City, Amraoti Camp, Morsi, Ellichpur, Anjangaon Surji, Shegaon and Buldana once and the seven dispensaries at Murtizapur, Karanja, Mangrulpir, Basim, Umerkhed, Pusad and Daryapur in company with the Second Superintendent. He attended the agricultural association meeting held at Patur and delivered a lecture on the benefits of veterinary treatment and demonstrated Burdizzo's method of bull castration. 8. Mr. D. M. Swamy, Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Nerbudda Division, toured in the five districts of his division and inspected seven important slaughter-houses and all the 15 dispensaries in his division twice. He attended the agricultural and cattle show held at Powarkheda farm and the Singaji fair. He also attended the meeting of the Co-operative Society of Piparia (Sohagpur tahsil). He inspected the offices of the Veterinary Inspectors, Nerbudda Division and Nimar district, once during the year. 9. Mr. Rahim Bux, Officiating Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Jubbulpore Division, toured in the five districts of his division and inspected 14 dispensaries, i.e., Jubbulpore dispensary thrice, Dindori and Shahpura dispensaries once and the remaining 11 dispensaries twice. He visited the cattle markets at Panagarh, Damoh and Saugor. He inspected the offices of the Veterinary Inspectors, Jubbul- pore and Saugor. The slaughter-houses at Jubbulpore, Mandla, Damoh and Saugor were also inspected by him.
4 10. Mr. J. M. Bhatt, Officiating Deputy Superintendent, attached to the laboratory, proceeded on leave from the 2nd October 1926 afternoon to the 10th March 1927, and on return was reverted to the Veterinary Inspector's grade, and posted to Gondia. Mr. P. S. Nair, Veterinary Inspector, Nagpur, was appointed to officiate as Deputy Superintendent, Laboratory, from the 2nd October 1996. 11. The touring work performed by the gazetted officers of the department is tabulated below :5 14. Compounder's Class.6 18. The statement attached (marked A) gives total positive findings. A.7 B.8 2. TREATMENT OF DISEASES. 19. The total number of outbreak reports of contagious diseases both reported and detected was 9,677 during the year under report as against 9,899 of the last year. This shows a fall in the number of reports received during the year. The mortality for 1925-26 which was 46,265 has fallen to 20,331 during the year under review. The timely measures taken by way of preventive inocula- tion against Rinderpest, Blackquarter, Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, etc., are mainly responsible for the decrease in the mortality. On the whole the year under review was a healthy one for the cattle of the province. 20. Rinderpest,9 being taken from Central India by tradesmen, while in Yeotmal the infection was brought from the Nizam's dominions. 25. Foot-and-mouth disease.10 30. In 15 outbreaks 1,017 animals were protected by preventive inoculation as against 868 inoculations in 110 out- breaks of last year. More preventive inoculation could not be carried out either from the unwillingness on the part of the owners or by the late arrival of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon on the spot. In 60 outbreaks the disease was con- firmed microscopically. 31. The results obtained by the special vaccines, known as Blackquarter Aggressin, as reported last year, are very encouraging and is undoubtedly becoming more popular with the cattle owners. 1,684 animals were vaccinated against this disease during the year. The results obtained by the use of this vaccination are very convincing and its use is being encouraged whole-heartedly by this department. 32. Piroplasmosis.11 Khutaghat and Khuria in Bilaspur district and approximately 200 animals were affected. 36. In another severe outbreak amongst bovines at Sonegaon in Nagpur tahsil 10 animals succumbed. Bovine Trypanosomiasis was successfully treated with Antimonium Tartaratum when treatment was a practical measure. 37. Strangles.12 reported. Treatment of ringworm in dogs and other animals with Petro-Iodine was tried and found successful. A case of Pyemia in a dog admitted in the Nagpur dispensary was successfully treated with Auto-Vaccine prepared in the laboratory. 3. OTHER DISEASES. 44. Medico-legal-cases.13 over the Nagpur Veterinary Inspector's office and store rooms and reconstruct a building in exchange. Plans and estimate for the latter were sanctioned and funds allotted. 49. Additional funds were allotted for constructing compounder's quarters at Dharni and the work was completed during the year under report. 50. Proposals for opening a new Veterinary dispensary at Patan (Jubbulpore district) were under consideration and as an initial step a Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was stationed at Patan and placed on special duty for castration and inoculation work. This arrangement has met the increased demand for Veterinary aid in that tahsil. 51. The construction of two small rooms in the Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeon's quarters at Sakoli was undertaken. 52. The Chikhli Veterinary dispensary buildings under construction last year were completed and occupied during the year. 53. Sites have been selected at Balapur and Karanja for construction of complete sets of dispensary buildings at those places as per standard plan. 54. A new set of buildings for the use of the Dyer Veterinary dispensary at Mohalla (Drug district) were being constructed by the Zamindar of Panabaras. 55. The quarters of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Drug, were re-roofed and the reconstruction of quarters for Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, compounder and servants at Baloda Bazar Veterinary dispensary was in hand. 56. Minor improvements to the compounder's quarters at Yeotmal were effected and a dressing shed at the Betul dispensary was under construction. Tin sheds were provided at Darwha and Kelapur for dressing purposes. A dressing shed at Hatta was also provided. 57. A sum of Rs. 2,000 was raised locally by public donations for the construction of buildings for the Veterinary dispensary at Waraseoni and Government sanctioned a grant of Rs. 2,860 for payment during the current year for the purpose.
14 58. During the year Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were posted to the Yeotmal, Buldana and Amraoti districts and were attached to headquarter dispensaries at those places. The necessity for providing peripatetic assist- ants in these important districts had been felt and they have succeeded in adding to the general efficiency. 59. For want of suitable accommodation the Akola District Council was unable to open a new dispensary at Risod. 60. The liberality shown by Rai Saheb Kalyan Singh Tahutdar of Taranga, in making a munificent gift of Rs. 10,000 and a plot of land worth Rs. 2,000 for construct- ing Veterinary dispensary buildings at Bhatapara has been acknowledged by Government and is keenly appreciated by this department. 61. The number of cases treated by Veterinary Inspec- tors and Assistants on tour was 445,333 including 55,378 castrations against 383,730 including 35,842 castrations in the previous year. The number of cases treated at dis- pensaries was 119,750 including 4,179 castrations as against 111,958 including 3,392 castrations in the past year. The mofussil cases, i.e., those supplied with medicines but not brought to the dispensaries, were 194,583 as against 180,499 in the previous year. III.-BREEDING OPERATIONS. 62. The Agriculture Department has, as usual, under- taken the work of cattle breeding and the upkeep of breeding farms, and the officers of this department have done their best to advance the operations by giving advice on profes- sional matters and paying regular visits to the farms. Alto- gether seven Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were placed on special duty to emasculate unsuitable bulls during the cold weather. The large number of animals dealt with exceeds the record figure established last year and shows the increas- ing popularity of castration by the Burdizzo method. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeons employed on this work were distributed as under15 63. During the year under report 19 cattle fairs and shows were held at different places in Central Provinces and Berar as shown in table No. XIV. The cattle fairs at Singaji (Nimar district), Wun (Yeotmal district), Bairam (Ellichpur taluq), Garhakota (Saugor district) and Hirdenagar (Mandla district) were largely attended. Dis- trict agriculture and cattle shows were organized at Sironcha (Chanda district), Bemetara (Drug district), Baloda Bazar and Pithora (Raipur district), Mungeli (Bilaspur district), Garraghat (Balaghat district), and at the Powarkheda Government farm (Hoshangabad district). The American Mission also arranged an agricultural and cattle show at Jogidongri, Pendra zamindari, Bilaspur district. The depart- mental staff attended these fairs and shows, opened tempo- rary dispensaries and arranged lectures on Veterinary matters supplemented by practical demonstrations at all the important fairs and shows. Magic lantern slides which were much appreciated by the public were also exhibited at the Sironcha, Garraghat, Wun, Mungeli, Pithora, Bemetara and Baloda Bazar shows. Copies of the Hindi translation of the treatise on " Some diseases of cattle in India" had brisk sale at the Mungeli, Pithora, Baloda Bazar and Bemetara cattle shows. 64. A temporary veterinary stall was opened at the Sironcha show. Various appliances, instruments and drugs used in veterinary practice were shown and explained to the visitors and practical demonstrations were also given. In the course of these demonstrations 169 ordinary cases were treated, three minor operations were performed, 149 bulls were castrated by the Burdizzo method and 45 animals given trypan blue treatment intravenously. The public greatly appreciated the work. IV.16 67. Messrs. Abdul Quadir and Kashi Prasad worked well and carried on the arduous duties in Berar in a tactful and efficient manner. 68. Mr. D. M. Swamy worked well and maintained the efficiency of the staff in the Nerbudda Division. 69. Mr. J. M. Bhatt for want of early training in bacteriology was found unsuitable to hold charge of labora- tory. 70. Mr. P. S. Nair worked well since his appointment as officiating Deputy Superintendent, Laboratory, and carried out the duties at the laboratory satisfactorily. 71. Mr. Rahim Bux carried out his duties in a satis- factory manner and efficiently supervised the staff in the Jubbulpore Division. 72. Subordinate staff.17 V.18 diseases. The diet which they received from birth in the form of milk is notoriously insufficient in quantity, and judging by the usual condition of cows after calving largely deficient in proteins and vitamins. The same deficiency exists in the food stuffs on which they depend for their nourishment during the remaining portions of their existence. Given large herds of cattle already affected from birth to maturity by avitami- noses it is not surprising that a super-imposition of pathological conditions concomitant with rinderpest, hæmorrhagic septicæmia, blackquarttr and the various piroplasmosis should result in easy infection and subsequent high mortality. 76. Although babesia in the blood system is an in- variable concomitant of the piroplasmosis of cattle they are primarily food deficiency diseases. This is demonstrated by the fact that medicinal treatment combined with proper nutrition usually effects a permanent cure, whereas medicinal treatment alone is merely temporary in its effect. The problems which arise when dealing with deficiency diseases like the piroplasmosis, trypanosomiasis of horses and other domesticated animals would be nearer solution if we had more accurate knowledge of the elements of nutrition requisite to bring about metabolism in the most efficient manner. In addition to the part played by faulty nutrition one must take into consideration the impossibility of meta- bolism being effectively induced without a good and frequent water-supply, without the necessary elements and salts in which the body cells engaged in the processes whereby body tissues are built up cannot function satisfactorily. In certain tracts in these provinces not only is grazing deficient during the hot weather, but cattle have frequently to be driven long distances to obtain water, which even then is stagnant, evil-smelling and highly charged with products of vegetable decomposition. Under such adverse conditions it is not surprising that they fall an easy prey to diseases both contagious and non-contagious and more particularly to the food deficiency diseases. The question naturally arises: How are these conditions to be improved ? (1) By improvement of faulty tanks and other sources of water-supply. (2) By adding powdered bone to the feed. (3) By supply of salt licks. (4) By providing ensilage pits.
19 The serum Simultaneous method of inoculation to which a reference was made in paragraph 78 of last year's report has, I regret to say, made no progress as funds were not. available. It is hoped that a start will be made this year. 77. The usual practice of training recruits in laboratory technique and under Divisional Deputy Superintendents has been maintained. Out of the 14 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons recruited during the year six went through the course of training in the laboratory and the remainder were trained in inoculation and castration method (Burdizzo). At the end of the year under report the total number of Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeons was 16 below the sanctioned strength. Difficulty in filling up the cadre of 145 assistants and maintaining that standard will be experienced until some provincial source of recruitment by way of a college is provided. 78. The popularity of the Burdizzo method of castra- tion has increased. District reports contain but one dissent- ing note regarding the usefulness of the instrument. The fact that many zamindars and malguzars have presented these machines for general use speaks for itself. 79. The Central Provinces Veterinary Association was recognized by the Local Government during the year under report. 80. The reasons for inability to completely attend the outbreak reports received in the Raipur, Drug, Bilaspur and Saugor districts and Rajnandgaon State were (1) the unwieldy area of each Assistant's jurisdiction, (2) simultaneous receipt of reports towards the close of the year, and (3) difficult touring conditions which prevail in the Chhattisgarh Division. The reports that remained unattended in Seoni and Amraoti districts were due to the same having been received on the 31st March 1927, the last working day of the year. 81. The designation of Veterinary Assistants was changed by the Local Government during the year to that of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in consonance with the practice prevailing in other provinces of India. 82. Agricultural College.20 2nd year (certificate) course were examined as usual by the Veterinary Adviser to Government, Central Provinces, in elementary veterinary subjects and 7, 7, 7, respectively, were successful. In addition papers were set by me for the Inter- mediate Examination of the Nagpur University in Agriculture and Veterinary subjects for students of the Nagpur Agricul- tural College. 83. Antipathy to inoculation and castration by the Western methods is still noticed on the part of cattle owners and met with in backward tracts, such as Melghat taluq, interior of Betul, Mandla, Drug and Buldana districts and elsewhere in the province. It is hoped that this prejudice will disappear in due course. 84. I am unable to assign a reason for the opposition in the Betul district, especially in the Multai tahsil, against inoculation. My plans for getting to the root of the trouble by placing an inspector there did not meet with approval. 85. Considerable improvement is noticed during the year in the reporting of outbreaks by village officials and the system of reporting outbreaks by service post card (instead of the prevailing method of sending outbreak reports in bearing covers) tended greatly to reduce delays in reporting in the Nimar district, where it was also introduced. 86. Magic lanterns and sets of specially prepared slides have been supplied by this office to all Divisional Deputy Superintendents to assist them in their propaganda business. 87. Fifty-six sanads were awarded during the year to malguzars and others for rendering help to the staff in carrying out inoculations and castrations. 88. No publications were contributed by the members of the department during the year. 89. It is hard to understand why the Umrer Municipal Committee should adopt an unsympathetic attitude towards the department by refusing to pay arrear contributions and further in reducing the usual contribution by half. It is remarkable in face of the extremely good inoculation work
21 done there. The Sehora Municipality has stopped its con- tribution which means that poor folk in the municipal area have to pay fees' for the treatment of their animals. The instructions issued in 1926 against supplying medicines for non-contagious cases without previous examination were not brought into effect entirely as the old custom has been in vogue since the earliest days of the department's existence. 90.

Agents for the sale of Publications issued by the Central Provinces Government. [NOTE.No. 822-604-XIV. GOVERNMENT OF THE CENTRAL PROVINCES. AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT. Nagpur, the 28th October 1929. READ2 inoculation of cattle is a difficult problem and amongst people unaccustomed to it compulsion is likely to be met with serious opposition. The loss to agriculturists every year from cattle disease, however, is so serious that pub- lic opinion may be expected to support measures designed to reduce the danger of infection even if they involve temporary inconvenience to individuals. At the same time, in order to extend the protection afforded by inoculation against rinderpest, it is contemplated in the ensuing year to make a beginning with the method of serum simultaneous inoculation, by which the period of immunity and with it the possibility of immunising the cattle of threatened areas is greatly increased. 3. The pre-occupation of the staff of the depart- ment with attendance on outbreaks of serious contagious diseases has inevitably had the effect of reducing the number of cases treated on tour, and the situation has been aggravated by the shortage of staff. The total number of cases treated was 387,295 compared with 419,947 in the preceding year, while the number of cases treated at the dispensaries was 137,647 compared with 126,259. Though the shortage of staff prevented con- centration on castration duty except in two divisions, yet the number of castrations was 64,483 (the largest number recorded in one year) compared with 56,409 in the year before. The increase in the number of castrations is wel- come, and it is hoped that with the prospect of a period of less intensity of epizootic disease it will be found possible in the current and the ensuing years to make a beginning with an intensive campaign of castration in carefully selected areas in accordance with the policy prescribed in paragraph 2 of the resolution on last year's report. There is evidently little or no reluctance amongst cultivators to substitute the more humane burdizzo instrument for the old-fashioned method of mulling. The number of animals emasculated appears perhaps small compared with the 150,000 young bulls which the Veterinary Adviser has estimated should be dealt with each year if the live-stock is to be appreciably improved. As Major Stirling has explained, however, the castration effected by the department is the substitu- tion of humane for primitive methods of emasculation and it is not the only agency employed and does not
3 entirely displace castration by cultivators themselves. It has also to be remembered that castration must be effected at a period when it will have the least effect on the muscular development of the animal operated upon. It is important, therefore, that attention should be con- centrated on securing the separation of bulls from the herds previous to castration, and in the instruction of cultivators in this direction the Veterinary Department can count upon the assistance of the Agricultural Department. 4. The extension of the activities of the depart- ment has been handicapped by the shortage of staff which continued during the year under report. To remedy the defect and to replace wastages among Veterinary Assistants, 15 additional scholarships are being awarded each year for the next three years beginning with the present year. Unfortunately in the absence of trained personnel from other sources upon which reliance could be placed in the past, it will be several years before the increased number of scholars is able to overtake the ordinary wastages and increase the strength of the staff. Till the complement of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons is completed and increased, it is not possible to man the dispensaries which the District Councils wish to open for the extension of veterinary relief During the year the cadre was 18 short of its sanctioned strength of 145. The department was also shorthanded owing to the absence of Mr. Wilson on leave preparatory to retirement and the duties of Second Superintendent were combined with those of the Deputy Superintendent, Nagpur Division. It is all the more satisfactory in these circumstances that the touring and inspection performed by the gazetted officers of the department show a sub- stantial improvement and that the outdoor work of the staff shows such a large expansion, and it is creditable to Major Stirling and his staff to have been able to establish a record in almost all the activities of the depart- ment. 5. For the organization of a service for the direction and superintendence of the department to cope with the expansion of its activities, which is contemplated in the future, a scheme has been under the consideration of
4 Government, and the rules have recently been issued for the new Superior Veterinary service. In order to provide training for candidates for this service, two scholarships for study in Veterinary Colleges in Great Britain have recently been awarded to local candidates. A notable feature of the development of the department in recent years has been the increasing activity of the laboratory side, and it is satisfactory that the heavy demands on the staff and equipment available during the present year have been as fully met as the report indicates. The question of the establishment of a veteri- nary institute equipped to meet the bacteriological and scientific requirements of the department's work has been under consideration for some time, and a suitable site has been definitely selected and reserved for the purpose. It is proposed to make a beginning with a well equipped laboratory to be accommodated in the same building with the administrative offices of the department and later to add to this a self-contained school equipped to train men to become Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. 6. The importance of propaganda work for the dissemination of a better understanding and application of improved methods cannot be over emphasized, and it is for this purpose that the Veterinary Department has taken advantage of local rallies organized by Co-operative Societies and of agricultural and cattle shows organized in connection with the Agricultural Department for lectures and publicity. In an agricultural community, dependent largely on the efficiency of its live-stock, veterinary science is an all-important handmaid, and Government looks to the Heads of Departments concerned to take the fullest possible advantage possible of co-operation in propaganda and practice for the improved protection and well being of agricultural cattle. In this connection Government commends to the notice of Commissioners and district officers the appeal for encouragement and support made by the Veterinary Adviser and is confident that it can count on their interest and influence in extending the usefulness of veterinary work within their charges. 7. The local Government recognizes that a con- siderable strain has been placed upon the department by the
5 conditions of the year under report, and it desires to place on record its appreciation of the keenness and energy which Major Stirling has brought to the discharge of his duties as Veterinary Adviser. Government is also pleased to notice the Veterinary Adviser's tribute to the officers of the department, and has commended the names of those officers whose services have been especially mentioned in the report. ORDER.No. 760/1-3. FROM MAJOR R. F. STIRLING, I.V.S., OFFG. VETERINARY ADVISER TO GOVERNMENT, Central Provinces, To THE REVENUE SECRETARY TO GOVT., Central Provinces. Nagpur, the 19th/22nd July 1929. SIR, I have the honour to submit herewith the annual report of the Civil Veterinary Department for the year ending the 31st March 1929. I regret the delay which was occasioned by the fact that the district reports did not reach my office until after the proper date. The last report arrived on the 5th July 1929 and no consolidation of figures could be begun until this was received. 2. Mr. C. W. Wilson, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Veterinary Adviser to Government, was on leave throughout the year. 3. I toured in the Nagpur, Chanda, Chhindwara, Mandla, Damoh, Seoni, Jubbulpore, Saugor, Betul, Akola, Buldana, Amraoti, Yeotmal and Hoshangabad districts by road marches and also travelled by rail and inspected 53 dispensaries, namely, the dispensaries at Raipur, Bilaspur, Mandla, Narsinghpur, Umrer, Chanda, Warora, Chhindwara, all the dispensaries in the Damoh, Seoni, Jubbulpore, Saugor districts (except Banda), Betul district (except Bhainsdehi), Nimar district (except Harsud), Akola district (except Balapur), Buldana district (except Deulgaon Raja), Amraoti district (except Dharni, Chandur and Daryapur), Yeotmal district (except Pusad, Umerkhed and Ralegaon) and Hoshangabad district (except Seoni-Malwa), and I also attended the Royal Commission on Agriculture Conference at Simla. I inspected the horned cattle slaughter-houses at Rahatgarh and Pritherpura and the offices of the Deputy Superintendents, East Berar, West Berar, Chhattisgarh, Nerbudda and Jubbulpore Divisions, and of the Veterinary
2 Inspectors, Hoshangabad, Raipur, Amraoti, Saugor, Buldana and Akola. I examined the students of the Nagpur Agricultural College, and the students of the Nagpur University in the Bachelor of Agriculture and Intermediate classes in veterinary science in March 1929. 4. Mr. R. V. Pillai, Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Nagpur Division, was placed in charge of the current duties of the Second Superintendent, in addition to his own duties, with effect from the 12th September 1928. He held charge of the veterinary work in the Nagpur and the Chhattisgarh Divisions from that date. He toured in Nagpur, Wardha, Chanda, Bhandara, Balaghat, Drug and Raipur districts and the Rajnandgaon State by road marches and also by rail, and inspected 23 dispensaries, viz., all the dispensaries in the Wardha, Nagpur, Balaghat, Bhandara, Drug, Chanda district (ex- cept Ahiri) and the dispensaries at Raipur, Dhamtari, the state veterinary dispensary at Rajnandgaon and also inspected the slaughter-houses in the Nagpur Division. He visited the cattle-breeding farms at Garhi and Sinde- wahi and organized measures to combat the severe out- break of rinderpest that threatened the Nagpur area through Ramtek. Pressure of work at headquarters due to combination of duties and frequent visits, at short notice, to seats of rinderpest outbreaks interfered with his normal tours of inspection. 5. Rai Saheb Gouri Shankar Shrivastava, Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Chhattis- garh Division, toured in the three districts of his division and in the Rajnandgaon, Khairagarh, Raigarh and Kanker States, and inspected 23 dispensaries, including the state dispensaries at Rajnandgaon, Khairagarh, Raigarh and Kanker; three dispensaries thrice, 14 dispensaries twice and six dispensaries once. He visited the Government cattle-breeding farms at Chandkhuri, Ruabanda and Sar- kanda, the Court of Wards cattle-breeding farms at Pithora, Thakurtola, Mohalla and Pakaria, the Krishi Gowrakshini farm at Sakri and the Malguzari cattle- breeding farms at Sarora, Raikheda and Barri. He inspected the slaughter-houses for goats at Raipur, Dham- tari, Baloda Bazar, Bhatapara, Bilaspur, Mungeli and Drug and for cattle at Raipur and Bilaspur and attended the agricultural and cattle shows held at Raipur, Bilaspur and Drug, and delivered lectures on cattle diseases with
3 magic lantern slides at these shows and at the Normal School for men at Bilaspur. He attended the meetings of the Agricultural Associations held at Raipur, Bilaspur and Drug. He also attended some of the rinderpest and hæmorrhagic septicæmia outbreaks and organized inocula- tion and castration. 6. The veterinary work in the Berar Division being too large a charge for a single Deputy Superintendent, this division was split into two charges, East and West Berar Divisions, with effect from 1st April 1928, the former comprising Amraoti and Yeotmal and the latter Akola and Buldana districts. Mr. Kashi Prasad held charge of the two divisions from 1st April 1928 till 31st May 1928 as Mr. Abdul Quadir was on medical leave. 7. Mr. Mahomed Abdul Quadir, Deputy Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department, East Berar Divi- sion, held charge of the division from 1st June 1928. He toured in the Amraoti and Yeotmal districts and inspected all the dispensaries in the Yeotmal district and the Amraoti district (except Chandur) and the offices of the Veterinary Inspectors, Amraoti and Yeotmal, attended two outbreaks and organized preventive measures. He arranged lectures with magic lantern slides at Nandgaon, Asegaon, Chikalda, Ghatang, Loni and Sawarkhed in Amraoti dis- trict and at Bori and Digras in the Yeotmal district. He attended the meeting of the Auditors of Co-operative Societies at Amraoti and delivered lectures on veterinary subjects. He also attended the cattle fairs held at Wun and at Bairam and the cattle show held at Rinmochan, at which he arranged lectures on cattle diseases with magic lantern illustrations. 8. On the 5th June 1928 Mr. Kashi Prasad, offici- ating Deputy Superintendent, opened the new West Berar Division. He toured in the Akola, Amraoti and Buldana districts and inspected all the 16 dispensaries in the Akola and Buldana districts once and also the dispensaries at Morsi and Chandur and paid 15 surprise visits to the dis- pensaries at Karanja, Chikhli, Malkapur, Mehkar, Deul- gaon Raja, Patur, Khamgaon, Shegaon, Mangrulpir and Buldana. He inspected the slaughter-houses for horned cattle and goats at Patur, Basim, Murtizapur, Akot, Man- grulpir, Balapur, Akola, Karanja, Malkapur, Shegaon, Jalgaon, Chikhli and Khamgaon. He visited the
4 Government agricultural farms at Basim and Borgaon, and attended the Uras fair held at Mangrulpir, the agricultural exhibition and cattle shows held at Loni, Pimplagaon Devi and Mayamba. He visited the Gowrakhshan at Patur. Karanja, Basim and Malkapur. 9. Mr. Rahim Bux, Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Jubbulpore Division, toured in the five districts of his division and inspected all the 16 dispensaries, i.e., Damoh and Jubbulpore dispensaries twice and the remaining 14 dispensaries once. He also paid surprise visits to Patan, Saugor, Rehli, Khurai, Damoh and Hatta dispensaries once. He visited the agricultural farms at Adhartal, Ratona, Mohania Court of Wards breeding farm at Sehora, and the Mission breeding farm at Damoh and also the Damoh and Panagar cattle markets. He inspected the slaughter-houses at Damoh, Saugor and the temporary one at Ghatera. He also inspected the offices of the Veterinary Inspectors, Saugor, Mandla and Seoni. In addition he attended 17 outbreaks and organized preventive measures. 10. Mr. C. N. Subannah, Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Nerbudda Division, toured in the five districts of his division and inspected all the 15 dispensaries in the division, 10 dispensaries twice and five dispensaries once. He also inspected the office of the Veterinary Inspector, Nimar, and the important slaughter-houses in his division, including the two meat markets at Pachmarhi. He attended the Singaji cattle fair and the Burman fair and arranged lectures on veterinary subjects, helped by magic lantern illustrations. He visited the agricultural farms at Khandwa, Powarkheda and Betul. 11. Mr. P. S. Nair, Officiating Deputy Superinten- dent, Laboratory, was deputed for a further course of training at the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, for a period of not less than six months and not more than 12 months with effect from 9th November 1928. The Director of the institute was asked to direct Mr. Nair's attention more especially to the study of the serum-simultaneous method of protection against rinderpest. 12. Mr. M. James, a senior Veterinary Inspector, who was deputed to the Imperial Institute of Veterinary
5 Research, Muktesar, for special training for six months from 1st April 1928, returned on completion of the course on 12th October 1928 and was appointed as Officiating Deputy Superintendent, Laboratory, vice Mr. P. S. Nair. 13. The touring work performed by the gazetted officers of the department is tabulated below: 6 Bilaspur, one was sent by District Council, Chanda, and two were sent by the Municipal Committees, Karanja and Shegaon. The student sent by the Chanda District Council left the class shortly after he joined. The first session also included two Government stipendiary students who had not completed the course last year. These two men, along with four other students admitted during the year, completed the course and passed the test. The man sent by the Karanja Municipal Committee could not complete the course in time, owing to ill-health, and remained under training. 17. Four probationary Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were trained in elementary bacteriological technique at the Veterinary Laboratory, Nagpur, prior to being posted for work in the districts. The Deputy Superintendent, Chhattisgarh Division, trained a proba- tionary Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in dispensary routine work and in practical inoculation and castration, while the Deputy Superintendent, Nerbudda Division, trained a probationary Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in the method of inoculation and intravenous injections, and the Deputy Superintendent, Jubbulpore Division, trained the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Mandla, and the Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeon, Hatta, in the method of intra- venous injection. II.7 including 520 from the divisions),giving particulare and suggestions for treatment of diseases were issued. The microscopical diagnosis of many pathological tissue changes, such as malignant and benign growths, and the idantifrcation of external and internal parasites were undertaken in addition to the above. 20. The following statment A gives the total positive finding:8 B.9 2. TREATMENT OF DISEASES. 21. The year was an unhealthy one for cattle. 9,797 outbreaks of contagious diseases were either reported or detected, with a mortality of 28,690 against 8,018 out- breaks and 20,900 deaths of the previous year which is an increase of 22.187 per cent in outbreaks and 37.267 in deaths. 22. Rinderpest.10 generally thought. The disease was most prevalent in Nagpur, Raipur, Saugor, Seoni, Chhindwara and Buldana districts. 26. Anthrax.11 alone, in 78 outbreaks 7,783 head of cattle were inoculated simultaneously with blackquarter serum and aggressin, and in 109 villages, where blackquarter is an annual occurrence, 18,543 head of cattle were protected with blackquarter aggressin alone before the onset of the blackquarter season. From the district of Buldana a mixed infection of hæmorrhagic septicæmia and blackquarter among bovines resulting in 35 deaths was reported. The practical experience of cattle owners, gained in the previous years of the extremely satisfactory results of the blackquarter aggressin inoculation in the young sus- ceptible stock in the villages, where the disease made a regular yearly appearance, led the villagers to offer in large numbers young stock for this method of protection during the current year. 29. Piroplasmosis.12 32. Experiments that were conducted by the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, for treating horses affected with surra by the combined intra- venous-intrathecal administration of the drug known as "Bayer 205", have gone to prove that this is the best method of treatment yet evolved for the cure of the disease. Although I have been given full discretionary powers either to destroy, or isolate and treat, any animal affected with surra according to the circumstances of each case, no suitable case has been so dealt with during the year under report. 33. Strangles was reported from Nagpur, Amraoti and Jubbulpore. The disease was microscopically con- firmed in 10 outbreaks. It occurred in a mild form. 34. Tetanus.13 39. Other diseases.14 45. Considerable improvements have been effected to the Jubbulpore veterinary dispensary buildings by rais- ing the walls of the dispensary buildings, re-roofing the premises and enclosing the verandahs of servants' quarters. 46. A new pipe connection was laid to the in-charge Veterinary Assistant Surgeon's quarters at Seoni; minor improvements to the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons' quar- ters at Baihar and Chanda were done and the usual annual repairs to the Bhandara and Sakoli veterinary dispensary buildings carried out. 47. A site on nazul land for the construction of dis- pensary buildings at Waraseoni was sanctioned by Govern- ment during the year, and it is hoped that the construction work will be started shortly as the requisite funds have been collected. 48. A full set of buildings was under construction at Bhatapara and Pithora, re-roofing the cattle shed at Kat- ghora was started, a latrine and a compound wall to com- pounder's quarters at Mungeli is under construction, and the roof of the dispensary buildings and Veterinary Assist- ant Surgeon's quarters at Dhamtari have been improved. 49. The number of cases treated by Deputy Superin- tendents, Veterinary Inspectors and Veterinary Assistant Surgeons on tour was 314,131 (including 58,211 castra- tions) as against 350,097 (including 51,428 castrations) in the previous year. The number of cases treated at dis- pensaries was 137,647 (including 6,272 castrations) as against 126,259 (including 4,981 castrations) in the past year. The moffussil cases, i.e., those supplied with medicines but not brought to the dispensaries, were 148,518 against 145,939 in the previous year. 50. For want of accurate details, it was stated in paragraph 51 of the annual report for 1927-28 that the management of the veterinary dispensary at Ahiri was taken over by the zamindar of Ahiri. The Deputy Com- missioner, Chanda, has since pointed out that the veterinary dispensary, Ahiri, is maintained by the Independent Local Board, Sironcha, and that the zamindar of Ahiri contributes liberally towards its maintenance.
15 III.-BREEDING OPERATIONS. 51. The Agricultural Department has, as usual, undertaken the work of cattle-breeding and the upkeep of breeding farms, and the officers of the department have assisted by giving advice on professional matters and pay- ing regular visits to the farms. Owing to paucity of staff only two Veterinary Assistant Surgeons could be placed on special duty to emasculate unsuitable bulls during the cold weather, one in Jubbulpore Division and one in Nagpur Division. The large number of animals dealt with shows the increasing popularity of castration by the burdizzo method in preference to the cruel process of mulling. 52. During the year under report 20 cattle fairs and shows were held at different places in Central Provinces and Berar as shown in Table No. XIV attached. The cattle fairs at Singaji (Nimar district), Wun (Yeotmal dis- trict), Garhakota (Saugor district), and Hirdenagar (Mandla district) were largely attended. No cattle show was held in connection with the Garhakota fair owing to the failure of crops in the northern districts. District agricultural and cattle shows were organized at Raipur, Bilaspur, Drug, Pithora (Bilaspur), Pusad (Yeotmal dis- trict), agricultural farms at Harda and Betul, Mundara (Seoni district), Burman (Narsinghpur district), Rin- mochan (Amraoti district), and cattle shows were held also at Loni (Basim), Pimpalgaon Devi (Malkapur), Mayamba (Buldana district) and Adgaon (Basim circle). The American Mission, as usual, arranged a cattle show at Jogidongri near Pendra. The departmental staff attended these and some other less important religious fairs and shows, opened temporary dispensaries and arranged lectures on veterinary matters supplemented by practical demonstrations of inoculation, castration, spraying and intravenous injections. This propaganda work was further developed in some cases by giving ocular proofs of the presence of some of the organisms by means of the microscope and seemed to be appreciated by the general public. 53. The Veterinary Inspector, Hoshangabad, attended a co-operative rally at Babai, the Veterinary Inspector, Raipur, and Veterinary Assistant Surgeons
16 attended the rally held at Baloda Bazar, and the Vete- rinary Inspector, Nagpur, attended a co-operative rally at Satak, Ramtek tahsil, and these officials delivered lectures on veterinary matters. Extensive propaganda work was carried on in the Berar and Chhattisgarh Divisions by lectures and magic lantern displays. IV.17 months training to the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, and subsequently employed as offici- ating Deputy Superintendent, Laboratory, two officiating Veterinary Inspectors were reverted to the grade of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, and four Veterinary Assist- ant Surgeons were promoted as officiating Veterinary Inspectors. 61. The strength of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons at the close of the year was 127. During the year two Veterinary Assistant Surgeons resigned, three Veterinary Assistant Surgeons retired, one Veterinary Assistant Sur- geon died and the services of two Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were dispensed with. 62. Recruiting.18 64. The cattle owner has now realized that trypan blau, in addition to being more or less a specific for tick fever, is an excellent tonic. The demand for this drug, during the year became so great that the District Coun- cils were asked to bear some of the expense. This they agreed to do. An arrangement has been made whereby the councils supply for each dispensary a certain amount of the dry powder. This is then sent to the laboratory at Nagpur where it is made into solution, sterilized, bottled and sent back to the dispensaries in the proportion in which the powder was received from each. This has reduced the cost to the department which was becoming too heavy for it to bear with a normal budget. An interesting point is mentioned by the Deputy Superintendent, Chhattisgarh Division. He states that he got better results in using the serum-alone method of inoculation against rinderpest, when he combined with it an intravenous injection of trypan blau. This is a field confirmation of the view expressed in paragraph 22. When a research officer is appointed an attempt must be made to ascertain the incidence of coccidiosis (coccidiæ are minute intestinal parasites) in animals of the Central Provinces, as this disease has also a great influence on the mortality in outbreaks of rinderpest. 65. The fall in the number of cases treated on tour is due to the fact that there were fewer outbreaks of foot- and-mouth disease during the year, and also because the staff had to concentrate all their energies in combating the very serious and widespread outbreaks of rinderpest. Also on account of shortage of staff, there were no touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons at some headquarter dispen- saries for the greater part of the year, and, in many instances, when assistants had to be granted leave, on medical grounds, the dispensaries had to be run by com- pounders using only the more simple remedies. Further- more, owing to financial stringency towards the end of the year, the touring of Veterinary Inspectors was restricted to attendance on outbreaks only. 66. The reason for the non-attendance of outbreak reports in Raipur, Drug, Bilaspur, Jubbulpore, Seoni and Chhindwara districts is that there was a rush of reports
19 close of the year when all the Veterinary Assistant Sur- geons were busy in attending reports received from other directions in the same area. 67. Agricultural College.20 the first week of November, the opening meeting being presided over by the Hon'ble Mr. T. J. Kedar, Minister for Agriculture, Central Provinces. Seventy-eight mem- bers of all grades took part in the discussions which covered a wide range of technical knowledge. This annual rally of all ranks of the departmental staff is undoubt- edly beneficial, in that it gives the men an opportunity of hearing the results obtained by their colleagues in the treatment of various diseases. 74. There has been a marked improvement shown in the reporting of outbreaks by village officials, and instances of delay were brought to the notice of the higher revenue officers who invariably took suitable action. This is probably one reason why more outbreaks of disease are recorded. 75. Opposition to inoculation is still noticeable on the part of villagers in backward and hilly tracts, chiefly on account of religious opinions, apathy and lack of education. 76. Proposals for the opening of several new dis- pensaries both in Berar and Central Provinces have had to be kept in abeyance for want of staff. It is hoped that the requisite staff will be forthcoming by the year 1932 when the first batch of 22 scholarshipholders sent to the Bombay Veterinary College this year should complete their course. 77. The clerical staff was strengthened by the appointment of two lower division clerks sanctioned by the Local Government for the newly opened office of the Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, West Berar Division. 78. In some places the work of the department was affected by unfortunate disputes between District Councils and Municipalities as to the relative contributions made towards the upkeep of dispensaries. In one or two places the District Councils decided to charge fees for animals coming from municipal areas, forgetting perhaps that by far the greater amount of the work of this department is done in the districts and outside municipal areas. Refer- ence may be made to the figures given in paragraph 49. The Balaghat District Council still refuses to have a tour- ing Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at Balaghat. This is
21 most unfortunate. Apart from the effect on the work in Balaghat itself, twice during the year when the man at Baihar was ill, it has meant that for days no reliever could be found and this at a time when rinderpest was acute in the Baihar and Garhi tracts. 79. The District Councils have been asked to provide relieving compounders in each district or, where the dis- tricts contain few dispensaries, it has been suggested that two councils might unite, such as Nagpur and Bhandara. The Berar councils have adopted the suggestion, but it has not been generally welcomed in the Central Provinces. In 1928 there were four compounders, who were Government stipendiary students, who were not working as compounders but employed as either clerks or packers in the Deputy Superintendents' offices. Fortunately these men have now been transferred gradually to their proper duties where new dispensaries were opened or a District Council had a vacancy. It must be pointed out that the post of compounder at Pachmarhi having been practically abolished, Government compounders are required only for Nagpur dispensary. It is impossible for Government to keep four or more compounders idling in Nagpur until a District Council asks for a reliever because one of their men is sick or on leave. I am afraid District Councils must make their own arrange- ments about reserves, and the department is only too will- ing to train any men that are sent to Nagpur to undergo the compounder's course. 80. To return to the question of rinderpest. The last outbreak was in the year 1925-26 and the following figures may be of interest: 22 the cultivator is utilizing the services of the department more freely. 81. It has long been recognized that the geographi- cal situation of this province was a main factor in the incidence of contagious disease. In November 1927 Mr. Wilson sent a statement to the Local Government showing the main routes by which cattle entered this prov- ince. These have been verified again and there is definite evidence that our main outbreaks this year came from the group of states adjoining the northern boundary of the province. In order to show graphically the routes taken by the nomad tribes and the main places at which rinderpest occurred, I am including in the appendices this year a rough sketch map (loose flap at the end of report). I travelled along most of the northern routes from Khurai to Narsinghpur and Seoni and found numerous cases of rinderpest amongst the herds. I, and others, did our best to persuade the owners or cattle-drovers to have their cattle inoculated. They all promised to halt at the next dispensary, but, of course, avoided it as if it were a place of plague. Without any powers one had to let these disease-carrying herds go on their way, knowing full well that they would sell at the next village, at a cheap rate, all animals not actually showing lesions but sick, and that any of the dying would be left in the nearest piece of jungle. 82. The following short account of an outbreak, that threatened Nagpur and was stopped, is of interest in that it shows how the disease might possibly be controlled if inoculation was made compulsory. In the month of December it was reported that the disease was severe in Ramtek tahsil and had got within 10 miles of Kamptee. The first action taken was to get together all the men who could be spared in Nagpur and convey them, with serum, by car, to villages on the main approaches to Nagpur. They were dropped at various places throughout one night, a distance of 89 miles being covered. On the following days Mr. Pillai, recalled from tour, took charge of the western side, whilst I devoted my atten- tion to the Kamptee approach and Nagpur proper. All the Government animals and many private herds in
23 Nagpur were immunised, and at the same time, with the aid of the Deputy Commissioner and the Cantonment Officer, the cattle of Kamptee were protected. The cattle in villages beyond Kamptee were also inoculated. The result was that the disease never got into Kamptee nor was a single case reported in Nagpur. A belt of immunised cattle had been made ; and, as has been proved, rinderpest does not travel except by actual contact of healthy with diseased cattle. In this connection I have to thank Mr. Crofton, Deputy Commissioner, Nagpur, for arranging that speedy intimation, of the occurrence of rinderpest, was to be given by the village officials to the nearest Tahsildar who, for a time, was ordered to communicate to this department by telegram. 83. Although Rs. 57,000 had been allotted in the budget of 1928-29 for the purchase of sera and vaccines, on account of the heavy demands made, the whole amount was expended by October 1928. In spite of there being a state of financial stringency in the province, the Local Government, within a few days, gave an additional grant of Rs. 40,000. As this proved insufficient, an extra amount of Rs. 18,875 was reappro- priated from savings in the departmental budget with the sanction of the Local Government. The department is, and the cattle owners should be, grateful to Government for the celerity with which this extra money was given. It undoubtedly saved the lives of thousands of cattle. 84. The Local Government has under consideration, at the moment, a scheme whereby the serum-simultaneous method of protecting animals against rinderpest can be gradually introduced into this province. 85. In paragraphs 95 to 99 of last year's report a reference was made to the use of hæmorrhagic septicæmia vaccine, which gives protection against this disease for at least one year, as against the nine days attained by the use of serum alone. 86. The vaccine was inoculated into 36,088 cattle before the monsoons of 1928-29 and the results were excel- lent. After consultation with the Director of the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, the vaccine was used
24 with serum in actual outbreaks during the rains. 20,460 animals were thus treated. 87. The method has proved so successful that demands for vaccine for use in 1929-30, made from the divisions in December 1928, were very large and in future this vaccination will entail extra expenditure on the department. 88. The number of animals protected against black- quarter by means of aggression rose from 12,439 in 1927-28 to 26,326 this year. Aggressin also protects for one year and has gained a remarkable popularity in those areas where, previously, the fatal disease blackquarter had a yearly incidence. 89. The question of legislation for the control of contagious disease is receiving consideration by both the Government of India and the Local Government. 90. In some districts, owing to the personal attitude of the Deputy Commissioner, cruelty to animals is being dealt with under the existing laws or rules. One Deputy Commissioner recommends that prosecutions should be instituted, under the cruelty act, against the "mulling" of bulls. The time has perhaps not yet arrived for such salu- tary action, and it would probably meet with an outcry that the Government was interfering with the customs and liberties of the people. But so much waits to be done. One keeps hoping that some influential Indian gentle- men, encouraged by the Local Government, will combine to start a branch of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in this province. They would be assured of all the help and advice that the officers of this department could give them. 91. With reference to the question of castration, owing to the staff of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons being about 20 below the sanctioned cadre, no attempt could be made to carry into effect the suggestion put forward in the Government resolution to last year's report that an intensive campaign in a limited area should be undertaken. 92. In my opinion there has been, in the past, a certain lack of information concerning the attitude of the Veterinary Department in regard to castration. When the use of the Burdizzo castrator was introduced generally in the Central Provinces the underlying inten- tion was not to improve the stock of the province, but to
25 prevent, as far as could be, cruelty to male bovines who were, previously, emasculated by "mulling". Any one who has witnessed "mulling" could not but be repelled by the horror of it. It has, however, crept into belief that the intention of the department was to improve breeding by the emasculation of bulls and not to prevent cruelty. 93. The Indian farmer wants a castrated bovine with such muscular development as will enable him to pull a plough or cart. I, therefore, quite agree with him when he says that he does not want castration of bovines to be done before the age of 2½ years (Berar), 4½ years (Chhat- tisgarh) or 4 to 5 years (in Nerbudda and the north). When one realizes that the earliest potential sexual age of a bull is about 15 months, it becomes obvious that castration, in itself, will not improve the breed of animals. The subordinate officers have therefore been instruct- ed to encourage farmers to separate masculine bovines from herds containing cows, and to concentrate on castra- tion by western methods with a view to eliminate cruelty only. 94. The officers of the department are frequently asked whether their work is being appreciated by the cultivators, or, perhaps more crudely, is the Veterinary Department making any advance and is it worth the money spent on it. In order to satisfy what is, after all, a very legitimate curiosity a statement is given below, showing a comparison of the work done ten years ago, five years ago and in the year under report:26 95. During the year the department has had numerous references made to it in the press of the province. Although these references have been mainly in the nature of more or less severe criticism of the admin- istration and usefulness of the department, they have been welcomed as a most encouraging and healthy sign. 96. When inspecting certain dispensaries in the province it has been noticed that, for years past, some have not been visited either by revenue officers or the representatives of local bodies. This is a great pity. Nothing gives more encouragement to most Veterinary Assistant Surgeons than a visit from someone outside the department. A Veterinary Assistant Surgeon will often quote, and sometimes at too great a length, what the Deputy Commissioner had said to him, and about his work, for months and sometimes years after the event. 97. Thanks are due to the Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners for the many helpful suggestions made by them at the time of forwarding the divisional and district annual reports, all of which have been carefully noted for action where and when possible. 98. When I come to the paragraph dealing with persons whose good work it is desirous to bring before the Local Government, I am in a difficult position. It would be easier for me to mention those who did not work well. They can be counted on one's fingers. When it was necessary to stop all leave almost all the officers of all grades accepted the necessity. Some few, of course, immediately produced medical certificates, but it is hardly necessary to say that they were not usually men of out- standing ability. I express my thanks to all the Deputy Superintendents, Veterinary Inspectors, Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and others of 100 dispensaries who, when the condition of grave cattle disease was explained to them, so loyally rallied together and, at some sacrifice of their own personal affairs, saved the province from a much worse outbreak. Mr. Pillai, as already mentioned, did excellent work in stemming the advance of rinderpest in the Nagpur district when Nagpur itself was threatened.
27 C. V. Nayudu, my camp clerk, gave me great assistance during this time and despite long weary journies was always alert and willing. Mr. N. Basavaraju, assisted by the office staff, did very good work during a year when the volume of corre- spondence was exceptionally large. 99.

Agents for the sale of Publications issued by the Central Provinces Government. [NOTE.No. 1346-A-489-XIV. GOVERNMENT OF THE CENTRAL PROVINCES. AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT. Pachmarhi, the 27th October 1930. READ2 necessitates repeated inoculations every ninth day. It is anticipated that the "serum simultaneous" method, which is now being developed, will, when a sufficient number of assistants have been trained in it, produce more satisfactory results. Meanwhile the value of inoculations can be gauged from the fact that whereas 15,809 animals died in the course of outbreaks of rinderpest only 178 animals which had been inoculated succumbed to the disease. 2. The ravages of other contagious diseases were also greater than in previous years. Foot-and-mouth disease in particular was very widespread in the last quarter of the year and made so heavy a demand on the attentions of the Veterinary staff as to cause some dislocation of ordinary work, especially in the matter of castration. The number of outbreaks was more than double that of the previous year and must have caused great economic loss to the agricultural population of the province by incapacitating the cattle, on which they depend for the cultivation of their lands. Government welcomes the measures which have been taken for instructing cattle owners on the treatment of this disease in its uncomplicated forms. The treatment of ordinary cases is perfectly simple and within the capacity of any tenant or cultivator, provided that the necessary remedies with instructions for their use are made easily available. Mortality, where it occurs, appears to be due either to neglect or to complications, especially when piroplasmosis is also present. The use of the valuable trypan blue remedy in outbreaks of this disease has proved successful, and it may be hoped that mortality will be materially reduced thereby. 3. The other contagious diseases also took a heavy toll of the cattle of the province, and in all of them the measures taken by the Veterinary Department resulted in a considerable measure of success. There seems little doubt that the value of preventive inoculation is at last being widely recognized by the people. The total number of inoculations performed by the department reached the considerable figure of 374,664, while the number of cattle which died after inoculation was only 289. The Director again lays stress on the spread of contagious disease by animals imported from neighbouring Indian States and refers to the desirability of legisla- tion to make inoculation and quarantine compulsory for
3 such imported animals. The question has engaged the attention of Government for some years past. To the difficulty which arises from the conservative habits of the people which has not yet made it practicable for Government to enforce inoculation even upon the people under its own jurisdiction in any province of India, must be added the expense of providing any adequate control and the difficulty of enforcing it along a frontier of some one thousand miles. It may perhaps be anticipated, however, that with the increasing popularity of preventive measures the people may themselves demand and apply reasonable precautions against the introduction of contagious disease from outside the province. 4. In view of the numerous and widespread out- breaks of contagious diseases and the very heavy calls made thereby upon a staff which was not designed to cope with such a situation it is greatly to the credit of the department that out of 16,884 reports received and detected only 29 remained unattended. The number of cases treated on tour rose from 387,295 in the previous year to 407,058, and those treated at dispensaries from 137,647 to 140,975. In addition to these medicines were supplied to 138,119 animals on tour and 151,410 from dispensaries. It was inevitable that the work of castration should suffer as a result of the heavy incidence of cattle disease. It is satisfactory therefore, to find that 61,829 animals were castrated, a number less than in the previous year but considerabl in excess of those recorded for 1927-28. 5. Further extension of the activities of the depart- ment is dependent upon increasing the staff. Unfortu- nately the present shortage must continue for another two years. There is no ready-made supply of trained candidates from which the department can recruit its staff and Government has to arrange for the necessary training which takes three years. With this end in view 15 additional scholarships tenable at the Bombay Veteri- nary College were awarded during the year, making the total number of Central Provinces students under training 22. Of previous scholars four completed the course and joined the department during the year, and 22, who were in earlier stages of their training, passed their examinations and received promotion in the ordinary
4 way. In addition to these measures for increasing the staff of Veterinary Assistants, Government awarded two scholarships of the value of £290 per annum each, tenable for four years in Great Britain, in order to train recruits for the superior staff of the department. Meanwhile the receipt of 40 requests for new dispensaries indicates an increasing demand for veterinary services, which the shortage of staff makes it impossible for Government to supply. As soon, however, as trained men become available, considerable expansion may be expected. The provision of buildings is largely a matter for local effort, which, it is hoped, may be stimulated by a real desire for veterinary facilities. In this connection Government congratulates the people of the Saoner tahsil on their public spirit in subscribing Rs. 12,000 for the erection of the new dispensary at Saoner, and notes with pleasure the generosity of Rai Bahadur Kalyansingh of Taranga, who presented buildings for the Bhatapara Veterinary Dispensary which was constructed during the year. 6. There was a notable increase during the year in the amount of work done in the Nagpur laboratory, which emphasizes the urgency of the establishment of the Veterinary Institute. The matter has unfortunately had to be postponed for the present owing to the financial stringency caused in part by the Civil Disobedience Movement, and it is unlikely that the provincial finances will permit of its being taken up next year. Government notes with pleasure that the department is alive to the importance of propaganda work. Members of the Veterinary staff attended all the important cattle fairs and shows in the province and took the opportunity to give lectures and demonstrations on veterinary subjects. Veterinary Inspectors also attended various co-operative rallies, and magic lantern lectures were given by Deputy Superintendents. The Director recommends the use of a demonstration van for propaganda work. The question will receive the sympathetic consideration of Government as soon as funds permit. 7. The report again emphasizes the desirability of taking measures to check cruelty to animals. This is essentially a matter in which the co-operation of the public is necessary. In the meantime Government commends the Director's remarks to the attention of its
5 own officials as well as of the public generally, and hopes that every opportunity will be taken to check such cruel practices as the overloading of carts and pack animals. A great deal could be done by local bodies under the Cruelty to Animals Act, which has been applied to most of the municipalities in the province. There is reason to believe that the Act is not enforced to the extent that is desirable, and until it is properly enforced in municipal areas it would-be of doubtful utility to extend the Act to the countryside, where enforcement presents far greater difficulties. The Director's remarks regarding the shoeing of working bullocks are of particular interest in this connection, and Government approves his proposal for making instruction in this matter a feature of the department's propaganda work. 8. The unhealthy conditions of the year under report made a severe call upon the energy of the Veterinary staff to which it responded with commendable enthusiasm. Government is pleased to record its appreciation of the valuable services rendered by Major Stirling as Director of Veterinary Services and of the admirable results achieved by the department under his direction during a year of exceptional difficulty. Government desires also to thank Major Priston for his interesting report and notes with pleasure the names of those officers of the department who have been especially commended therein. ORDER.No. 907/1-3. FROM MAJOR W H PRISTON, F.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., OFFG. DIRECTOR OF VETERINARY SERVICES, Central Provinces. To THE REVENUE SECRETARY TO GOVT. Central Provinces. Nagpur, the 7th July 1930. SIR, I have the honour to submit herewith the annual report of the Civil Veterinary Department for the year ending the 31st March 1930. Mr. C. W. Wilson, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Veterinary Adviser to Government on leave, retired from service from the 5th December 1929 on attaining the age limit. Major R. F. Stirling, Officiating Director of Veterinary Services, held charge of the department up to 21st March 1930 when he proceeded on leave to Europe for ten months and four days. I took over charge of the department from 22nd March 1930. I.2 years, and proposals for opening several new Veterinary Dispensaries at important agricultural centres and posting an additional Veterinary Assistant Surgeon to each tahsil being under consideration, the local Govern- ment sanctioned, in addition to the seven scholarships annually awarded, and tenable at the Bombay Veterinary College, 15 more scholarships tenable at the Bombay Veterinary College consecutively for three years, commencing from June 1929, in order that the necessary personnel may become available from the year 1932. Thus twenty-two scholarships were accordingly awarded to suitable candidates during the year. 4. With regard to the work of existing Scholars at the Bombay Veterinary College, from the Central Provinces, one third year stipendiary student, who was detained for a supplementary examination in October 1929, completed the course, obtained the diploma and joined the department. Three of the six third year stipendiary students completed the course, successfully passed the diploma examination and joined the depart- ment during the current year. Eighteen of the twenty- two first year students and four of the five second year students passed the annual examinations and were promoted to higher classes. 5. Compounders' class.3 knowledge had considerably deteriorated and he made no effort to improve whilst under training presumably due to lack of intelligence. The Yeotmal District Council was accordingly informed and advised to dispense with his services as soon as they got another suitable candidate trained. 6. Four probationary Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were trained in elementary bacteriological technique at the Veterinary Laboratory, Nagpur, prior to being posted for work in the districts. Mr. James, Officiating Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Chhattis- garh Division, instructed the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, Bemetara and Gandai in the correct method of giving intravenous injections. 7. During the year 49 students of the Agricultural College, Nagpur, 14 of the B.Ag., 32 of the Intermediate University courses and 3 of the second year Diploma Course were examined by Rai Saheb R V. Pillai in Elementary Veterinary subjects. 14, 21 and 3 respectively were successful. II.4 treatment of diseases were issued during the year. In addition to the above, the examination of milk, urine and various pathological tissue changes (benign and malignant) and the identification of external and internal para- sites were undertaken. 2.5 With regard to the rinderpest outbreaks, in the large majority of cases the source of contagion was traceable to animals imported from the neighbouring states. Improvement is noticeable in the reporting of outbreaks by village officials as the Deputy Commissioners continue to take the keenest interest in seeing that the revenue staff promptly undertake this work. 14. Rinderpest.6 15. The number of inoculations undertaken amounted to 251,338. In several instances inoculations had to be repeated in herds every ninth day owing to the tem- porary nature of the immunity established by the "Serum Alone" method of inoculation. In 1,918 outbreaks the number that were protected with serum alone against rinderpest were 251,338 head of cattle (including 250 goats). The mortality among those inoculated was only 178. The "Serum-simultaneous" method of inocu- lation against rinderpest now practised on a small scale, when sufficiently well established will, doubtless, afford the necessary protection against fatal attack for some years in those animals that are subjected to such inoculations. 16. Foot-and-mouth disease.7 The reason for non-attendance to some out-break reports received during the year in Raipur, Bilaspur, Drug, Jubbulpore, Damoh and other districts was an abnormal rush of reports of foot and mouth disease towards the close of the year, when all the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were busy attending to reports received from other directions in the same area. 10,617 outbreaks of this disease resulted in a mor- tality of 1,078 against 5,102 outbreaks and 625 deaths of last year. The largest number of outbreaks, namely, 809, was recorded in the Nagpur district. The loss of life through this disease alone is negligible but it incapacitates working cattle from 10 days to sometimes 3 months in neglected cases. The economic loss to the cultivator particularly when this happens during an important season of the year is very great. The departmental officers toured from village to village treating the affected animals and advising the cattle owners on simple treat- ment and sanitary measures to be adopted in such out- breaks. In addition to these measures printed Marathi pamphlets instructing the cattle owners, in simple language the methods to be adopted in the treatment and control of the disease, were freely distributed. In this disease death is due more to neglect or complications with infection by piroplasmosis than to the disease itself. Injection of trypan blue solution intravenously in the early stages of infection has been proved to curtail the duration of the disease. It is now being extensively used in these outbreaks. There is no doubt that in cases where the disease is taken in hand in its early stages the treatment is most efficacious. 17. It should be mentioned that in the Nimar district the Deputy Commissioner introduced a scheme whereby the villagers could procure simple drugs in the bazar for the treatment of uncomplicated cases of the disease. The scheme and its results will be reported on later when more information has been collected. The procedure certainly would appear to be a sound one. 18. Anthrax.8 each. More than 10 outbreaks were reported from the Bilaspur, Raipur, Chanda, Bhandara, Hoshangabad and Jubbulpore districts, the highest number being 29 from the Raipur district. The total number of outbreaks was 173 with 890 deaths, against 234 outbreaks and 879 deaths of last year. During the year 23 outbreaks were con- firmed microscopically, but only in 13 outbreaks pro- tective inoculations to the number of 1,099 animals were carried out with anti-anthrax serum. No deaths occurred among the inoculated animals. 19. Haemorrhagic septicæmia.9 Amraoti, Buldana, Saugor, Nagpur and Wardha districts. Of these 662 outbreaks, 143 were microscopically confirmed. In 66 outbreaks 6,281 animals were protected with serum and in 96 outbreaks 8,371 animals were protected with blackquarter aggressin and anti-serum simultane- ously. Further in 136 villages where this disease is known to occur annually, 26,193 animals were protected with aggressin alone just before the monsoon when the disease generally breaks out. Last year this aggressin alone protection was given to 18,543 head of cattle. The protection afforded to the young stock to last over the blackquarter seasons during their susceptible age has been so much appreciated by the cattle owners that it is likely to increase considerably the demand for this kind of protection in the future. 21. In some parts of the province these two diseases, the latent germs of which frequently develop in the soil after rain, resuscitate at the same time, probably due to the geographical situation. In such areas protection against both diseases is afforded at one and the same time. 22. Piroplasmosis.10 quantity issued during the previous year, is a proof that this line of treatment is increasing in popularity. 21,421 animals are reported to have been definitely cured of piroplasmosis by this treatment as against 22,933 of last year. 23. 12 cases of P gibsoni were diagnosed in the local Laboratory. The treatment of this disease with tryparsamide has given extraordinarily good results. 24. Trypanosomiasis.11 30. Spirochaetosis.12 new Veterinary dispensaries if the department can supply the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. At present no men are available for these posts. There is much room for expansion of departmental activities throughout the province but want of funds and paucity of staff appear to be the chief obstacles. The difficulty in regard to staff will eventually be over-come when new recruits are available from the scholarship holders at present under- going training at the Bombay Veterinary College. The Deputy Commissioner, Chhindwara, emphasises the need for more Veterinary dispensaries at Amarwara and Pandhurna. I agree with him. 36. Instances have occurred during the year under report, of District Councils and Municipal Committees who conjointly maintain Veterinary dispensaries in certain areas, not agreeing with regard to the proportion of their contribution towards such maintenance. At the close of the year a climax was reached at Bilaspur when the Dis- trict Council without any previous reference to the Department ordered the local dispensary to be closed. This matter is still under investigation. 37. As a result of an enquiry made regarding the future extension of Veterinary dispensaries throughout the province, no less than forty requests for new institutions have been made and most of them in the Central Prov- inces districts. Our first aim should be, presumably, to provide a second Veterinary Assistant Surgeon for each of the existing tahsil dispensaries as soon as men are available. 38. The state dispensaries at Jagdalpur and Kankar were each inspected once by the Deputy Superintendent, Chhattisgarh Division. 39. The number of cases treated by Deputy Super- intendents, Veterinary Inspectors and Veterinary Assist- ant Surgeons on tour was 468,887 (including 61,829 castrations), against 314,131 (including 58,211 castrations) in the previous year. The number of cases treated at dispensaries was 148,599 (including 7,624 castrations), as against 137,647 (including 6,272 castrations) in the past year. The moffusil cases, i.e., those supplied with medicines but not brought to the dispensaries, were
13 151,410 against 148,518 in the previous year. Cases supplied with medicines by staff on tour have been shown in Table No. IV. 40. Buildings.14 Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Seoni, and for the neces- sary annual repairs to be done at the Lakhnadon Veteri- nary dispensary. III.15 Pendra. The departmental staff attended these and other less important religious fairs and shows, opened temporary dispensaries and arranged lectures on Veteri- nary science supplemented by practical demonstrations of inoculation, castration, spraying and intravenous injec- tions, which were appreciated. 49. At the Agriculture Exhibitions held at Wardha and Betul separate Veterinary stalls were opened, where pathological specimens, instruments and charts were exhibited and magic lantern lectures on Veterinary sub- jects, were given, supplemented by practical demonstra- tions in castration by the "Burdizzo" method and intravenous injections. 50. The Veterinary Inspector, Raipur, attended a co- operative rally at Baloda Bazar, the Veterinary Inspector, Drug, attended eight co-operative rally meetings held in the district, and the Veterinary Inspector, Chhindwara, attended six co-operative rallies held in his circle, and these officials delivered lectures on Veterinary work. Extensive propaganda work was also carried out in the Berar and Chhattisgarh Divisions by magic lantern demonstrations. 51. Each Deputy Superintendent was supplied with a magic lantern and a collection of selected slides to enable him to carry out this work to the best advantage. 52. By the above means a great deal has been achieved in the way of removing prejudices against the more up-to-date methods of treatment. 53. There is, however, one thing in this connection which deserves mention, namely, the scientific process of shoeing working bullocks. This is a subject which has never received the attention it deserves. Shoeing as practised by the village Nal-bunds often develops into a form of cruelty which could and should be prevented. It would be possible to train Nal-bunds and get them to demonstrate to cattle owners the effects of good and bad shoeing. This might be carried out together with other propaganda work which the department is undertaking at present.
16 54. For carrying out propaganda work a demonstra- tion van for the department is advocated and would be invaluable. Therefore, I repeat and strongly recommend the suggestion made in previous years that a Veterinary demonstration van should be supplied. 55. Sanads were awarded during the year to land- owners and others in recognition of their assistance to the subordinate staff when carrying out Veterinary propa- ganda work in the districts. IV.17 Subordinate staff.18 59. The post of first clerk sanctioned for the office of the Deputy Superintendent, West Berar Division, was abolished and the clerical staff of the Deputy Superin- tendents was strengthened by the appointment of one additional lower division clerk to each of the four offices, Jubbulpore, Nerbudda, West Berar and Nagpur Divi- sions. 60. Two of the Provincial compounders attached to the offices of the Deputy Superintendents, Chhattis- garh and East Berar Divisions, were transferred to Dis- trict Council service. One Provincial compounder attached to the office of the Deputy Superintendent, Nerbudda Division, was promoted as lower division clerk to fill a vacancy in that office, the remaining provincial compounder was attached to the Laboratory special staff for "Serum-Simultaneous" operations against rinderpest. 61. The response made by the District Councils to the request that they should train their own compounders to be maintained as leave reserves was not encourag- ing. Sometimes it happens when a permanent com- pounder goes on leave his place is taken by an untrained man; this adversely affects the popularity of the dis- pensary concerned, especially when the Veterinary Assist- ant Surgeon has to move constantly to attend outbreak reports. If the District Councils do not improve in this direction it will be necessary to award Government stipends to suitable men in order to meet the demand for trained compounders. 62. Cases have occurred where district bodies have not taken full advantage of the advice given by the Departmental officers during the course of their tours especially with regard to the transfers of individual com- pounders, etc. I would suggest that it would be to the interest of the public if such recommendations were more frequently complied with. 63. Recruiting.19 64. The distribution of staff and location of Veteri- nary institutions will be seen in the map at the end of this report. The touring and inspecting work done by Gazetted officers is shown in Statement C. 65. The names of the following officers of the Department for work carried out during the year under report are brought to the notice of the Local Govern- ment:20 Central Provinces, and the "Second Superintendent", Civil Veterinary Department, Central Provinces, to those of "Director of Veterinary Services", Central Provinces, and "Deputy Director of Veterinary Services", respectively,during the year under report, to conform with the nomenclature adopted in other provinces. 69 The increase of work carried out in the Labo- ratory during the year under report is worthy of special notice and the necessity for increasing the Laboratory staff demands favourable consideration. The special at- tention of the Local Government is drawn to the urgency of providing the new Veterinary Institute which has been sanctioned. This Institute will prove to be of inestimable value to the province, especially in view of the difficulties experienced at present, i.e.:21 71. The helpful suggestions made in the forward- ing remarks of the district reports by the Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners have been carefully noted and many thanks are due to them for their valuable assistance. 72. The thanks of the Department are due to the Chairmen of District Councils, Local Boards and Muni- cipalities, and also to other non-officials who have con- tributed towards the successful working of the department during the year.

Agents for the sale of Publications issued by the Central Provinces Government [NOTE.No. 42-694-XIV GOVERNMENT OF THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT Nagpur, the 7th January 1932 READ2 Government hopes that the experiments, to which Major Stirling refers, will result in an appreciable reduction in the cost of this operation. The importance of the control of cattle disease, to the utmost extent that is humanly possible, is emphasised by the fact that, even in a comparatively favourable season like the past one, the avoidable loss caused to the cultivator by the death and disablement of his cattle amounts to several lakhs of rupees, while in periods of virulence the loss is doubled or even trebled. It is, therefore, gratifying that the measures adopted by the department for the protection of cattle from blackquarter have had such marked success that the mortality recorded from this disease is less than a 10th of what it was in three out of the past four seasons, while the decline in the incidence of, and mortality from, hæmorrhagic septicæmia is another encouraging instance of the increasing success of preventive vaccination. A scheme has been drawn up for investigating paraplas mosis, and, if it is possible to put it into operation, as is hoped, with the assistance of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, important results are looked for that will facilitate the campaign against this wide- spread infection and the economic loss occasioned by it. It is clear from the report that the old-fashioned prejudice against inoculation and vaccination of cattle has largely been overcome and replaced by confidence owing to propaganda and successful results, and that the protection of the live-stock, which represents so large a proportion of the capital of the agricultural community, is now primarily a question of the provision of funds and staff. 3. The limitation of touring for a few months owing to financial stringency and political conditions account for the marked fall in the number of cases treated on tour which contrasts with the increase in the number of cases treated at the dispensaries. It is a satisfactory feature that, in spite of the difficulties of the year, the number of useless bulls castrated has been more than maintained and has advanced nearer to the figure which is considered to be the minimum required for the improvement of the breed of cattle. 4. It is unfortunate that financial conditions bar the way to the fulfilment of the request of local bodies for the
3 opening of so many new dispensaries, but the existing staff barely suffices to meet existing commitments, and it is impossible to start new dispensaries until the necessary additions to the staff can be supplied and funds are provided for maintaining these institutions. In certain instances municipal committees and district councils have not been able to see eye to eye in the matter of the proportion of their contributions for the support of dispensaries, and it is satisfactory that the report records that the local bodies concerned have been able to come to an agreement. Considerable advantage is taken of dispensaries in towns by the local owners of animals and the urban authorities representing them should be willing to recognize the benefits received and to contri- bute their share along with the rural community in meeting the cost of such dispensaries. 5. Government is pleased to record its appreciation of the efficient administration of the department during a difficult period by Major Stirling and Major Priston who officiated as Director for the greater part of the year. Government also desires to thank Major Stirling for his interesting report, and notes with pleasure the names of the various officers of the department whose work has been specially commended in the report. ORDER.No. 1190-1-3 FORM MAJOR R. F. STIRLING, I.V.S., DIRECTOR OF VETERINARY SERVICES, Central Provinces, To THE REVENUE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Central Provinces. Nagpur, the 10th August 1931. SIR, I have the honour to submit herewith the annual report of the Civil Veterinary Department for the year ending, the 31st March 1931. I regret the delay in sub- mission which was occasioned by the fact that the district reports did not reach my office until after the proper date. The last reports arrived on the 23rd June 1931 and no consolidation of figures could be begun until these were received. 2. Major W. H. Priston, F.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., officiating Director of Veterinary Services, held charge of the department up to the afternoon of the 11th December 1930, when he reverted to his appointment in the United Provinces. He toured in the Nagpur, Wardha, Balaghat, Jubbul- pore, Mandla, Seoni, Chhindwara, Betul, Akola and Amraoti districts by road marches and inspected 23 dispensaries in these districts. He inspected the offices of the Deputy Superintendents, East Berar and Jubbulpore Divisions, and of the Veterinary Inspectors, Amraoti, Chhindwara, Jubbulpore and Mandla. He also visited the Government cattle-breeding farms at Bod, Garhi and Ellichpur. He examined at Betul the candidates for the 22 scholarships tenable at the Bombay Veterinary College.
2 3. I took over charge of the department on the 11th December 1930, having been permitted to return to duty. I toured in the Nagpur, Bhandara, Betul, Chanda, Seoni, Jubbulpore, Mandla, Damoh, Saugor, Narsinghpur, Chhindwara, Amraoti, Akola, Buldana, Yeotmal and Hoshangabad districts by road marches and also by rail and inspected 41 dispensaries in the above districts and the Khandwa veterinary dispensary. I inspected the Rahatgarh slaughter-house, the offices of the Deputy Superintendents, Civil Veterinary Department, Jubbul- pore and Nerbudda Divisions, and the office of the Veterinary Inspector, Hoshangabad, and the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon employed on the rural up- lift scheme at Pipariya. I also attended the meetings of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research held at Delhi during January 1931. I supervised the work of serum-simultaneous inoculations against rinderpest, in villages adjoining Nagpur and Bhandara, with a view to test the reaction of the cattle of the Province. 4. Rai Sahib R. V. Pillai, officiating Deputy Director of Veterinary Services, was confirmed in the Central Provinces Veterinary Service, Class I, from the 1st June 1930. He made over the additional charge of the office of the Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Nagpur Division, on the 24th June 1930. He toured in the Nagpur, Bhandara, Balaghat, Drug, Bilaspur, Raipur, Wardha and Chanda districts by road marches and inspected 16 dispensaries. He visited the cattle-breeding farm at Garhi and assisted in the selection of scholars for the Bombay Veterinary College. He then proceeded on leave on medical grounds. I.3 7. Of the Central Provinces scholars studying at the Bombay Veterinary College, four of the six third year stipendiary students completed the course, success- fully passed the diploma examination and joined the department during the current year. Thirteen of the twenty-one first year students and ten of the eighteen second year students passed the annual examinations and were promoted to higher classes and one second year student was detained for a supplementary examination in October 1931. 8. Two Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were deputed during the year to the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, for periods varying from three to six months, for practical training in elementary laboratory methods, including the theory and practice of the serum- simultaneous method of inoculation against rinderpest. Both the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons completed the course and rejoined their duties in the department. 9. Compounders' class.4 11. During the year 14 students of the Nagpur University, 8 of the B. Ag. and 6 of the Intermediate course were examined by Mr. James in elementary Veterinary subjects. Eight and six, respectively, were successful. II.5 For years it has been recognized that this formidable disease is introduced, in many cases, from adjoining territories. The local Government has asked this depart- ment to devise a scheme by which a series of quarantine stations could be arranged around the borders of the province. The department has this matter under serious con- sideration, but is of opinion that this question will be of purely academic interest until such time as the financial stress is relieved. It is very satisfactory to note that 115,824 animals were protected against this disease by "serum alone" method. It is more satisfactory to note that the mortality amongst these protected animals amounted to only 71. I hazard an opinion that these 71 were in the acute stage of the disease when the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon inoculated them. 17. Serum-simultaneous inoculation against rinder- pest.6 there were approximately 800 bovines. He tried to persuade the owners of all these animals to have their cattle inoculated. On the following day 47 cattle were brought in front of him for the purpose of immunization. They were inoculated. About six weeks or two months later rinderpest broke out in this village and the villagers noted that the only cattle which did not develop any symptoms of rinderpest were the 47 which had been treat- ed by the Deputy Superintendent, whereas many of the remainder did so. The number of deaths amongst non- treated cattle was so grave as to encourage a deputation to come from Gumgaon to the Deputy. Superintendent and petition him to revisit their village and inoculate the remaining animals. It was most unfortunate that, owing to the requisition of his services elsewhere, the Deputy Superintendent was unable to comply with their request. Before closing my remarks on this section I may be allowed to state that, in co-operation with Deputy Superintendents Nair and James, and following on the investigations already made by reputed European and Asiatic workers a series of experiments have been planned for execution during the forthcoming year. The results of these experiments, if we are successful, will save the Local Government a certain amount each year. A report of our experiments will be submitted to the Local Government in due course. 18. Foot-and-mouth disease.7 the previous year. The disparity between the number of animals affected and the number of reports is, in my opinion, due to the reduction in time in visiting outbreaks, by which the officers of this department were able to give preventive inoculation to nearly 2,000 animals. 21. Haemorrhagic septicaemia.8 the entire absence of the disease amongst the herds that have been protected. It was noticed that cultivators in certain villages who were formerly disinclined to this vaccination not only now advocate it, but actually press the department to have their cattle protected earlier than the usual time. During the year 31,845 animals were protected by aggressin, 2,129 by aggressin and serum-simultaneous method and 251 by serum alone method. 23. As has been explained in previous reports the use of aggressin before the rains protects an animal for one year. The disease hardly ever occurs except after rain and is thus most marked from June till September, again in December and after the mango-showers. 24. Piroplasmosis.9 found very successful. Besides these 32 cases of P. Mutans were also confirmed microscopically in bovines. Unfortunately trypan blue does not seem to have much effect in this infection. The total quantity of trypan blue solution issued amounted to 1,471,610 c.c. as against 1,398,903 c.c. last year. 26. Trypanosomiasis.10 32. Distemper and Canine Typhus.11 justify this step. Buildings have been completed by the District Council and a compounder provided by them. The total number of veterinary dispensaries was 100 at the close of the year. 37. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeon placed on special duty at Pipariya on rural uplift work continued to do useful work. Rural uplift work was also started in other districts and the officials of the Department are helping this movement, so far as it lies in their power. 38. District councils and municipal committees who were jointly responsible for maintaining veterinary dis- pensaries appear to have come to an agreement in regard to the proportion of their contributions and the differences at Bilaspur have now been satisfactorily settled. 39. The State veterinary dispensaries at Rajnand- gaon, Khairagarh and Raigarh were each inspected once by the Deputy Superintendent, Chhattisgarh Division. 40. The number of cases treated by Deputy Superintendents, Veterinary Inspectors and Veterinary Assistant Surgeons on tour was 377,215 (including 82,776 castrations), against 468,887 (including 61,829 castrations) in the previous year. The number of cases treated at dispensaries was 159,150 (including 9,810 castrations), as against 148,599 (including 7,624 castrations) in the past year. The mofussil cases, i.e., those supplied with medicines but not brought to the dispensaries, were 121,623 against 151,410 in the previous year. Cases supplied with medicines by the staff on tour have been shown in Table No. IV. 41. The fall in the number of cases treated on tour was due largely to political reasons. In some few cases Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were actively hindered in their work and in many districts the villagers refused to accept aid which was offered by a Government department. The majority of ordinary cases treated on tour occur during the rains or early autumn and in this year there was a marked fall during those months. When I took charge in December 1930 the number of castrations was thousands less than on a similar date in the previous year. Major Priston had borne the brunt of the bad times and as things became more settled there
12 ensued sudden and numerous demands from the peasants for the castration of their animals by the Burdizzo method, with the result that another record in the number of castrations has been attained, viz., 92,586. 42. When it is remembered that ten years ago, that is, before the introduction of the use of the Burdizzo Castrator, the Department was congratulating itself on having 4,876 castrations to its credit in the year, the increase is very marked and has been very rapidly attained. According to calculations there should be some- where over 100,000 useless bulls for castration each year, if the breed of cattle is to be improved. As I pointed out in my report for 1929 (paragraph 93), equally essential is the separation of entire masculine bovines from herds containing cows or heifers. I would ask the allied departments to assist this department in pro- paganda along this line. 43. Buildings.13 veterinary dispensaries. A store room was added to the Narsinghpur dispensary, the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon's and compounder's quarters were re-roofed. 48. The Amraoti District Council had a shed built for in-patients at Anjangaon Surji veterinary dispensary and the Nimar District Council had a new drain con- structed at the Khandwa veterinary dispensary to carry waste water from the quarters of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon and the Compounder. III.14 in the villages with the co-operation of the Local Bodies is under consideration of Govenrment. 52. The Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Nerbudda Division, attended a co-operative rally held at Itarsi and the Veterinary Inspectors, Nagpur, Raipur, Drug, Bilaspur, Chhindwara and Saugor respectively attended 3, 3, 9, 2, 3 and 1 co-operative rallies held in their charges. These officials delivered lectures on veterinary work. Extensive propaganda work was also carried out in the Berar and Chhattisgarh Divisions by magic lantern lectures. 53. Sanads were awarded during the year to land- owners and others in recognition of their assistance to the subordinate staff when carrying out veterinary pro- paganda work in the districts. IV.15 By the death of Onkar Prasad Dubey, probationary Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Wardha, the department lost a promising young worker. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeon attached to this office was transferred to the field where his services were of more use. In his place the post of statistical clerk was sanctioned and a suitable man was engaged. 57. Owing to financial stringency the tour work of Veterinary Inspectors and Veterinary Assistant Surgeons was restricted to ten days a month for a few months in the year and the Deputy Superintendents and the Veterinary Inspectors were asked to stop routine dis- pensary inspections and to carry on propaganda work instead. 58. Owing to the depletion of its income, the Buldana District Council dispensed with the services of a second dresser in each dispensary of the district whose duty was to help the compounder in attending to cases during the absence of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon on tour. This step, though apparently unavoidable, is a regrettably retrograde one. It means that when the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon is on tour, the compounder will be alone to treat and dress animals. This does not matter so much when the owner himself attends the dis- pensary, but the animal is frequently sent in the charge of a small boy, who is unable to control properly the patient and hence dressings and so forth cannot be efficiently carried out. 59. The District Council, Mandla, owing to a fall in its income, abolished the posts of whole-time chowkidars at the Dindori and Shahpura Veterinary dispensaries and sanctioned an allowance of Rs. 3 per mensem for watch and ward work at these dispensaries. 60. Recruiting.16 62. The names of the following officers of the department are brought to the notice of the Local Government for their work during the year:17 I am delighted to record that, during this year, this matter has been taken up by the Commissioner, Nagpur Division, and he is trying to start a local branch of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. This effort will, I am sure, receive both moral and financial support from all classes and communities which abhor the present conditions and have the welfare of animals at heart. 66. Before concluding my remarks, which must be curtailed this year, I may be permitted to record my very high appreciation of the work done by Major Priston, who officiated for me during a very strenuous time. 67. I may be allowed also to thank the Divisional Commissioners, Deputy Commissioners and chairmen of local bodies who, in submitting reports, have made sugges- tions which will receive careful consideration during the coming year. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, R. F. STIRLING, MAJOR, Director of Veterinary Services, Central Provinces.
