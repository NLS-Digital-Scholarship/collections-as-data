Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General, North-West Frontier Province, No. 1367 G., dated 8th August 1902. READ2 Veterinary Hospitals at Peshawar and Dera Ismail Khan. Otherwise it may become necessary to apply to the Punjab Government for a share in the services of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, who has lately been appointed for the above purposes. In any case the District Boards should make a start by arranging in consultation with the Superintendent, North Punjab, for the deputation of their Veterinary Assistants to the Bactereological Institute at Muktesar for instruc- tion in the treatment of rinderpest, anthrax, &c. 5. The Provincial cost of the Civil Veterinary Department for the year was Rs. 6,695-15-7. This is made up of the pay and travelling allowance of the Subordinate Veterinary establishment and of contingent charges. ORDER.No. 672 PART I.3 Number removed from re- gister. 15. Seven stallions were removed from the register, of which one died, three were destroyed4 II.5 PART II.6 Average of mares covered per stallion. 53. The average of mares covered per stallion employed on mule-breeding is shown in Table IX, viz. 38 against 35 last year, and that of stallions employed on donkey-breeding 13.00. The low average of donkey-mares covered is accounted for by the fact that the two donkey stallions employed on donkey-breeding were allotted to stud work after the covering season was over. 54. Referring to Table XIV, attached to the report, it will be seen that Rs. 280-11-4 were expended under this head, the average cost per donkey per year being Rs. 113-2-4. (2).7 but it enables him to become thoroughly practical and useful. Half the Veterinary Assistants who journey about can do little or no good. Very often they have not even been able to procure medicines, willing as they would have been to treat animals when called upon to do so. I have known them not even to possess a thermometer, a most necessary adjunct to a Veterinary Practitioner's outfit.

REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, FOR THE YEAR 1902-1903. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Peshawar. PRINTED AT THE "COMMERCIAL" PRESS. 1903.
Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General, North-West Frontier Province, No. 1341 G., dated 7th August 1903. READ2 Commissioners who should arrange in communication with Captain Trydell that reports of outbreaks of cattle disease should be sent direct by Patwaris, &c., to the Veterinary Assistant so as to secure prompt action being taken. 5. The provincial cost of the Civil Veternary Department for the year, which covers the pay and travelling allowance of the office and subordinate Veterinary establishment and contingent charges rose from Rs. 6,695-15-7 to Rs. 8,722-9-4, and an explanation of the increase which appears under all heads is being separately called for. In conclusion the Chief Commissioner desires to thank Veterinary Captain Trydell for his management of the Department and the present report. ORDER.No. 117PART I.-IMPERIAL REPORT. (2).2 II.3 (2).4 Stallions whose produce won prizes. 33. High water II, appears to have been the most successful horse whose stock won prizes but one horse show is hardly sufficient to prove the breed of stallion which is the most successful as the best getter of prize winners. Stands opened and abo- lished. 34. With the exception of a donkey stand opened as an experimental measure at Shankiari in the Hazara district there were no others. None have been abolished; two were recommended to be closed as they are doing no good, but it was decided not to take any action in the matter until a final decision is arrived at by Government regarding the future conduct of horse-breeding operations. Donkey stallions in charge of Lambardars or others. 35. At the end of the year 5 donkey stallions were under the care of Lambardars and others at a fixed allowance for feed and keep of Rs 10 per month per stallion. Their average covering was 25.50. VI.5 Average of mares covered per stallion. 42. The average of mares covered per stallion as shown in Table IV was 44.87 against 55.28 last year. Demand for stallions. 43. This last paragraph shows a bad falling off in the demand for stallions, 44 is a poor average. Cost of feed and keep and how defrayed. 44. The total cost of feed and keep of the pony stallions, vide Table XI, was Rs. 1,596-8-4 against Rs. 1,565-2-7 and the general average cost per pony per annum Rs. 228-1-2 against Rs. 259-8-5 last year. It was wholly paid by the respective District Boards. (2).6 (3).7 63. There are now 4 men trained in Rinderpest inoculation out of 7 qualified Veterinary Assistants (one is working with the Army Remount Department). They were sent to be taught as they could be spared and I trust to be able to say within a few weeks that they are all equipped with inoculation outfits, but these will be of little use unless outbreaks of disease are reported direct to them when the disease is actually existing. Of course a good working Veterinary Assistant should be able to get information himself at times if he has the knack of making himself popular and explaining that he is in a position to protect a large percent- age of a herd from contracting and succumbing to Rinderpest. It is very dis- couraging to men to travel long distances and then find the reported out-breaks had died out perhaps 3 weeks or a month before their arrival on the scene. I have had experience of having gone a day and a half's journey in monsoon weather to a village where I found the out-break had died out nearly a month before the news of its existence had been received in my office and I have sent men out to see what they can do to combat with various reported outbreaks of disease, but they invariably returned with the same answer. They found there was no sickness about nor had there been any for some time. As the horse breeding will very shortly be entirely in the hands of the Army Remount Department we shall soon be able to make a move and devote our time in the direction of looking after cattle only.

Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General, North-West Frontier Province, No. 1544-C., dated 11th August 1904. READ(2) four donkey stallions were transferred free of charge by the Civil Veterinary Department and deducting one casualty in Peshawar there are now eight at work, viz.:No. 65ANNUAL REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH PUNJAB, 1903-04. PART I.-IMPERIAL REPORT. (A)(2) Number added to register. 11. Two donkey stallions were added to the register during the year under report: one was received by transfer from the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, and the other from the North Punjab Circle. Number removed from the register. 12. 35 donkey stallions were removed from the register during the year under report. Of these, 1 died, 1 was transferred to North Punjab, 26 trans- ferred to the Army Remount Department, and 7 were handed over to the District Boards. Casualties. 13. Vide Table VII, there was 1 casualty during the year under report, the percentage of death being 3.03. Number present at close of year. 14. There were no donkey stal- lions present at the close of the year. Number at stud work. 15. Vide Table IX, there were 10 donkey stallions employed at mule- breeding as against 17 employed last year. Average of mares covered per stallion employed at stud. 16. Table IX also gives the average of mares covered per stallion employed at stud, which was 88.80 against 61.41 last year. Demand for stallions. 17. The same remarks as under the head "Demand for horse stallions," paragraph 9, apply here. (2)(3) Number served by Government stallions. 24. Out of 675 mares present at the close of the year under report 341 were covered by Government stal- lions as shown in Table IV attached. (3)(4) VI.(5) Average of mares covered per stallion. 39. The average number of mares covered per stallion as shown in Table IV was 48.16 against 38.66 last year. Demand for pony stallions. 40. From these figures it would show that there is a moderate demand. The 4 non-selected districts accepted 4 stallions offered to them (free of cost) by the Civil Veterinary Department. Cost of feed and keep and how defrayed. 41. The total cost of feed and keep of the pony stallions is shown in Table XI to be Rs. 1,446-11-4. The general average cost per pony was Rs. 241-1-10 as against Rs. 228-1-2 last year. (2)(6) Number at stud work. 48. Out of the 8 donkey stallions present at the close of the year, vide Table IX, 2 were employed on mule-breeding and 3 on donkey-breeding against the same number employed last year. Average of mares covered per stallion. 49. The average of pony mares covered per stallion was 41.50 against 34.00 and that of donkey mares 36.66 against 20.00 last year. Demand for donkey stallions. 50. There is only a moderate demand for donkeys. The Civil Veterinary Department handed over 5 to District Boards. Cost of feed and keep and how defrayed. 51. As shown in Table XIV, the total cost under this head was Rs. 610-8-7 and the general average cost per donkey stallion per annum Rs. 120-11-5 against Rs. 153-3-4 last year. (2)(7) V.(8) nothing for them to look forward to in the way of pay and promotion, that is to say, nothing is laid down to show that they shall receive any kind of reward as an inducement to work well or gain promotion by merit. When the horse-breeding operations were handed over to the Army Remount Department and the majority of Imperial paid Veterinary Assistants were transferred to them, I proposed that the establishment should be increased, and that inducements must be offered to entice good men into the Department. This matter, I am glad to say, is under consideration. 60. Another matter I have represented is that it is apparently very difficult to get men to serve up on the frontier at all, because comparatively few are educated at Punjab Veterinary College who belong to those parts; so to try and obviate this to a certain extent, I suggested that a young man of some standing, good family, &c., from each district might be selected and sent to Lahore to qualify as a Veterinary Assistant. Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu and Kohat have each arranged to send one. When I find I have a fair complement of men I very shortly hope to be able to equip itinerating men with saddle bags for carrying medicines, and an instrument case, who will go from village to village treating sick animals. This equipment will not involve much expense, and a good Veterinary Assistant should do useful work if provided with tools.

Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General, North-West Frontier Province, No. 3346, dated 19th August 1905. READ(2) being provided with fixed head-quarters, where owners can make sure of finding an Assistant whenever they require his services; while the appointment of two Inspectors will sufficiently guarantee the periodical inspections of these outlying dispensaries. 6. The question of providing stud bulls and the Superintendent's sugges- tion to start a bull-breeding farm are under consideration. The difficulty of obtaining suitable animals would seem to point to the necessity of making a serious effort in this direction, but it will probably be found necessary to ask for financial assistance from Imperial Funds in the first instance. 7. The present number of horse and pony stallions is quite insufficient for the needs of the Province, and Peshawar was unfortunate in losing two ponies during the year, but substantial assistance from Government will be necessary if their number is to be increased to anything approaching full requirements. This deficiency has already been brought to the notice of the Government of India, and a scheme for providing an additional number of stallions was submitted in June last. The four horse stallions provided by the Civil Veterinary Department at the close of last year covered 224 mares, giving an average of 56 per stallion; and the four pony stallions covered 271, an average of 67.75 as against 48.16 in the previous year. The average cost of maintenance was Rs. 266 for each horse and Rs. 226 for each pony stallion. Seven donkey stallions were maintained as against 5 in the previous year, one having died at Bannu at the beginning of the year: these covered 390 mares, an average of 55.71 per stallion. Provision for 4 more donkey stallions has been included in the scheme referred to above. 8. The question of Cattle Fairs is being taken up, and has been referred to the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, and to District Officers for opinions. It might be advisable to convert the combined Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan Horse Fair into a Horse and Cattle Fair, and also to make the proposed Peshawar Horse Fair into a Horse and Cattle Fair, while a small Cattle Fair might be held at Haripur in the Hazara District. The Chief Commissioner is of opinion that it only requires a certain amount of initiative to stimulate the interest of the people in this direction. 9. In conclusion the Chief Commissioner desires to thank Captain Trydell and Mr. Oliver for the manner in which they performed their duties during the year, and also to express his appreciation of the way in which Captain Walker has so thoroughly interested himself in the conditions and requirements of this Province since he took over charge. The scheme of reorganization has made a satisfactory start, and there is every promise of successful development in the near future. ORDER.No. 66. FROM VETERINARY-CAPTIAN G. K. WALKER, F. R. C. V. S., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab and North-West Frontier Province, To THE REVENUE COMMISSIONER, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, PESHAWAR. Dated the 27th June 1905. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province, for the year 1904-05. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, G.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT, CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH- WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, 1904-05. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. 1. During the year under report certain changes in the administration took place. At the beginning of the year the Province was in charge of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North Punjab. Consequent on the duties connected with horse-breeding in certain selected districts being taken over by the Army Remount Department the North Punjab Circle was abolished. The Civil Veterinary administration of the Province was then taken over by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab and North- West Frontier Province. Officers in charge. 2. Captain Trydell as Superintendent, North Punjab, held charge until October 8th, when he was trans- ferred to Bengal. Mr. Oliver, Second Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab and North-West Frontier Province, took over and held officiating charge until my return from furlough on 11th February. I held charge for the remainder of the year. Tours of Officers. 3. Captain Trydell was on tour 15 days during the period he was in charge, and travelled 158 miles by road and 107 miles by rail within the con- fines of the Province. I visited Peshawar in March. I.(2) Captain Trydell inspected the following dâk lines for contagious disease in the course of his tours:(3) III.(4) Fairs and Shows(5) the lines which they are to follow in future. The care of stallions in non- selected districts and the inspection of bulls and stock of all kinds is an important part of the duty of the Veterinary staff. With this work as well as their duties connected with contagious disease and with the treatment of animals in Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries they will have their hands full. In addition intelligent reports on original subjects are expected, for which there is a great field. Training in inoculation. 27. During the year two men were sent to Muktesar for training in inoculation work. V.TABLE I. Statement showing the Main Results of Veterinary Colleges and Schools during 1904-05.

REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, FOR THE YEAR 1905-06. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Price Re. 0-7-6 or 7½ pence. PESHAWAR: NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE GOVERNMENT PRESS. 1906.
Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General, North-West Frontier Province, No. 3475, dated 24th August 1906. READ( 2 ) The Chief Commissioner would be glad if the Superintendent would frame definite proposals as promised in paragraph 14 of his Report for the year 1904-05 and convey them to the district authorities concerned, when they will doubtless receive full and careful consideration, and he agrees that until a separate Superintendent is appointed for the Province the establishment of a Bull Farm must remain in abeyance. 7. A substantial addition was made during the year to the numbers of horse and pony stallions employed in the Province by the liberal grant of Rs. 16,800 made for the purpose by the Imperial Government. With this sum three horse and six pony stallions were purchased and distributed between the four non-selected districts and the Tochi and Kurram Agencies, and the Local Boards of Peshawar provided further funds for one horse and one pony stallion. The number of stallions has now risen to 18, of which 8 are classed as horse and 10 as pony, and these should prove sufficient for some time to come. The new purchases were not, however, employed during the year under report, and their services during the present year have been wisely limited on account of their somewhat immature ages. Four horse and four pony stallions were actually employed, the same number as last year, and they covered respectively 67.75 and 53.5 mares. The average cost of maintenance worked out to Rs. 325 for each horse and Rs. 226 for each pony stallion: in the case of horse stallions the cost has risen consider- ably, but no reason has been assigned. Two new donkey stallions were purchased by District Boards during the year, bringing the total number for the Province up to nine. These covered 327 mares only, whereas last year seven stallions covered 390 mares, and the cost of maintenance per donkey rose from Rs. 148 to Rs. 183. The Superintendent points out that some of the donkeys are of doubtful utility, and the Chief Com- missioner hopes that Local Boards will provide funds for the replacement of such animals. It is to be regretted that the purchase of four new donkey stallions out of the special grant made from Imperial funds could not be effected, but the Civil Veterinary Department was unable to meet the indent owing to the large demand made by other Provinces. The deputation of syces to Hissar for instruction which was proposed by Captain Walker is a measure which might well be adopted by all districts, and the attention of Deputy Commissioners is invited to the matter. 8. The remarks contained in paragraph 44 of the Superintendent's Report upon the subject of again importing Merino sheep into Kagan have been read with much interest, and the Chief Commissioner is glad to see that Captain Walker has given the matter his personal attention. The results of the importation of Australian Merino rams into this valley as well as into the Kurram will be awaited with considerable interest. 9. In addition to the annual Horse Show held at Dera Ismail Khan, a combined Horse and Cattle Show was held for the first time at Peshawar, and was attended with considerable success. The districts of Hazara and Kohat contributed to the show. It is intended to convert this into an annual gather- ing, and there is every reason to anticipate that it will achieve widespread popularity and quicken interest in horse and cattle breeding amongst the agri- cultural classes of the three districts concerned. The Chief Commissioner takes this opportunity of tendering his thanks to Captain Walker and the local officers to whose energies and interest the success of the newly inaugurated show were so largely due, and he is pleased to learn that the cattle fair at Haripur suggested last year will shortly be inaugurated. There can be no doubt but that the establishment of fairs at suitable centres must stimulate the interest of the people in the right direction. 10. The appointment of two Veterinary Inspectors has proved most beneficial, and the augmentation of the staff of Veterinary Assistants has re- sulted in considerable all-round improvement. Necessary sanction for the entertainment of seven more Veterinary Assistants has been obtained, and two men have been actually secured, but until the rates of pay are enhanced the
( 3 ) difficulty of attracting qualified men remains as before both in this Province and the Punjab. This may be met to some extent on the return of the scholarship holders from the Lahore College, but the necessity for raising the pay of Assistants will undoubtedly assert itself eventually. 11. The Chief Commissioner thoroughly endorses Captain Walker's pro- nouncement that the year has witnessed commendable progress and that the administration has been largely improved. He also agrees that the development of the Department, if it continues at the present rate, will in time demand the appointment of a separate Superintendent for the Province, but for the present he is satisfied with the arrangement arrived at in consultation with the Punjab Government by which the third Superintendent recently appointed holds charge of six districts of the Punjab in addition to the North-West Frontier Province. In conclusion the Chief Commissioner desires to record his appreciation of the manner in which Captain Walker has improved the working of his Department during the year and of the real interest which he has exhibited in all matters relating to both horse and cattle breeding as well as to the treat- ment of cattle disease throughout the Province. ORDER.No. 174ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT, CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH- WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, 1905-06. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. Officers in charge. 1. I held charge of the Civil Veterinary work in the Province through- out the year in addition to that of the Punjab. The Second Superintendent, Punjab and North-West Frontier Province, held charge of a portion of the Punjab proper, and had no occasion to deal with any matters connected with the Frontier Province. Mr. Oliver was Second Superintendent until February 26th, when he handed over to Mr. Woodley. 2. I spent 53 days on tour within the confines of the Province, and travelled 2,945 miles by rail and 546 miles by road in my capacity as Superin- tendent, North-West Frontier Province. My head-quarters being at Lahore, a considerable distance by rail had to be travelled on every occasion I visited the Province. Work performed on tour. 3. An extended tour was made in connection with the supply of stallions and the inspection of mares in the non-selected districts. The work of the subordinate staff and their dispensaries were also inspected and notes sent to District Officers. A tour was made in Hazara for the purpose of in- vestigating the conditions of cattle and sheep breeding in that district with results that will be noted later. An outbreak of rinderpest in Peshawar District was visited. The ponies of the tonga lines were inspected in the course of my tours. Shows at Peshawar and Dera Ismail Khan were attended. I.( 2 ) Reports of disease. Detailed instructions have been issued in the form of a special circular, and an Agricultural circular on the subject has also been promulgated. Even now it is doubtful if all outbreaks are reported, but it is gratifying to be able to say that the position has much improved. The increase in the Veteri- nary staff tends also to bring outbreaks to notice which would otherwise not be reported. The figures are compiled from the reports of the Veterinary Assistants, and may be regarded as reliable so far as they go. In course of time it may be possible to render the system of reporting disease more perfect. EQUINE CONTAGIOUS DISEASE. 8. In Hazara District equine contagious disease is dealt with by the Army Remount Department. Glanders( 3 ) Peshawar Division, and several Veterinary Assistants were actively employed, and the district officials and several private gentlemen co-operated in giving valuable assistance. Preventive inoculation( 4 ) They are all equipped with instruments and medicines from District funds, and when on tour they can take a certain amount in saddle-bags with which they have been provided. They visited 877 villages, treated 2,970 animals, and castrated 31. A very great increase in the work done over last year is to be noted in the Peshawar District, where, however, an extra man was employed. On the other hand the work done on tour in the Dera Ismail Khan District has much decreased. The Veterinary Assistant employed there in the previous year was transferred to the charge of the Veterinary Hospital and the itinerating man's head-quarters removed to Tank. This may account some- what for the figures, and it will be noted later that the numbers treated at the hospital have largely increased. As a matter of fact the itinerating Veterinary Assistant does not seem to have been popular, and he has since resigned. Veterinary Hospitals( 5 ) Grants-in-aid. 27. Out of the grant of Rs. 35,000 made by the Government of India for agricultural improvements in the North-West Frontier Province, Rs. 10,000 were given for veterinary improvements and allotted as follows:( 6 ) Replacement of stallions. 34. As pointed out last year, this number was quite inadequate to the needs of the Province. In consultation with District Officers and after a per- sonal enquiry I submitted a scheme for Government assistance on the lines that had been adopted in the Punjab. A standard scale was fixed, which involved an addition of 8 horses and 4 donkeys. An expenditure of Rs. 16,800 was sanctioned by Government for their purchase. All maintenance charges will be borne from District or Political funds, and the cost of replacement will be shared by Government and districts accord- ing to an approved scale. The horses, which were all Arabs, were purchased in Bombay through the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, and supplied to the following districts and Agencies:( 7 ) Services of donkey stallions( 8 ) Veterinary Assistants. 48. The increase in the number of Veterinary Assistants was carried out during the year, with the exception of the reserve man, whose appointment remained vacant for most of the time, no candidate being forthcoming. I was able to inspect the work of all the men. Rules have been drawn up and published for the Veterinary staff similar to those in use in the Punjab, and promulgated (Agricultural Circular No. 7). With the aid of these rules and systematic inspection, I think I may record that the work of the Veterinary Assistants has considerably improved. Their work in connection with contagious disease, hospitals and dispensaries, and tours in villages has already been referred to above. Incrcase of cadre. 49. Government have been pleased to accept my recommendations, and a further increase of seven men to allow of one man being employed in each tahsil and one each in the Kurram and Malakand Agencies has been sanctioned from the 1st April 1906. It is to be regretted that up to the date of the submission of this report I have only been able to obtain two recruits, and those were direct appointments in the 2nd grade. At present there is a dearth of candidates for employment. The supply of qualified men is not equal to the demand, and the fact remains that better terms can be obtained in other departments and services. The scholarship-holders, however, when qualified, will naturally be required to serve in the Province. The recruiting difficulty exists in the Punjab also. A scheme for the increase of the pay of Veterinary Assistants is contemplated in that Province, and it will be necessary for the Frontier Province to follow suit accordingly. Training in inoculation. 50. During the year three men were sent to Muktesar for training in inoculation. V.( 9 ) A definite policy has been established and certain lines of procedure drawn up. Agricultural Circulars similar to those in use in the Punjab have been adapted for the use of the Province and issued by the Revenue Commissioner. The Department appears likely to develop rapidly, and it will supply a necessary element in the agricultural welfare of the Province. I remarked last year that the undivided attention of a Superintendent was required. That happy solution to a difficulty has not yet been arrived at, but a third officer has been sanctioned for the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province. His head-quarters are to be at Rawalpindi, and, as he will only have charge of six districts of the Punjab, he is to divide his time equally between the Punjab and the North-West Frontier Province in future. Some of the difficulties of administration will no doubt be removed under this new arrangement, but there is plenty of work in the North-West Frontier Province for a Superintendent who could give his whole time to it.

Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General, North-West Frontier Province,( 2 ) Commissioner takes this opportunity of reminding them that such buildings should be constructed on the standard plan, which can be gradually worked up to, that the Local Bodies are primarily responsible for the cost, and that all lavish expenditure is to be deprecated. 6. There were 11 stud bulls at work in 1906-07 as compared with 6 in 1905-06. There is, however, much room for improvement, and definite proposals should be framed as promised in paragraph 14 of the Report for 1904-05. It is however true that the first requisite is to find a proper source of supply. 7. The proposal mentioned in paragraph 30 of the Report for the increase of 2 donkey stallions( 3 ) execute agreements to that effect. The two Veterinary Inspectors and the subordinate staff have done good work during the year, and the progress made has been very substantial. The secret of success is that the Veterinary agency should gain the confidence and secure the co-operation of the people among whom they work. There are many indications in the statistics of inoculation, castration and treatment of cattle that they are working on the right lines, and the Chief Commissioner trusts that the Superintendent and District Officers will see that they do not depart from them. 11. For the satisfactory results achieved the Chief Commissioner desires to thank Captain Walker and Mr. Woodley. ORDER.No. 132. FROM V. DE V. H. WOODLEY, ESQUIRE, M.R.C.V.S., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province and North Punjab, To THE REVENUE COMMISSIONER, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE. Dated Rawalpindi, 29th June 1907. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province, for the year 1906-07. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, V. DE V. H. WOODLEY, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province and North Punjab.
REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPART- MENT, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, 1906-07. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. Officers in charge. CAPTAIN WALKER was in charge of the Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province, for about half the year under report. Owing to the appointment of a 3rd Superintendent for the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province a redistribution of charges took effect, and I took over charge of the North-West Frontier Province from Captain Walker on November 12th, 1906. I opened my head-quarters at Rawalpindi in the capacity of Superintend- ent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province and North Punjab, on January 1st, 1907. Under the new scheme I am in independent charge of the North-West Frontier Province Civil Veterinary Department, and hold charge of six districts of the Punjab under the Chief Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department of that Province. My touring is to be equally divided in the two provinces. As Superin- tendent, North-West Frontier Province, I spent 39 days on tour in the confines of the Province and travelled 1,499 miles by rail and 673 miles by road. Captain Walker was on tour in the Province for nine days and travelled 552 miles by rail and 116 miles by road. Work performed on tour. 2. During the year under report I attended the following Horse and Cattle Shows in the Province:(2) The majority of District Board bulls were inspected in the course of my tours. All the pony and donkey stallions were inspected, with the exception of the donkey at Swabi, and reports submitted to the District Officers concerned. I inspected the tonga lines between Hasan Abdal and Abbottabad, Kohat and Bannu, Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan, and Dera Ismail Khan and Tank. Work performed on tour by Captain Walker. Captain Walker made a tour in the Hazara District and also visited Peshawar to inspect at that place. I.(3) Tetanus. 12. Fifteen cases of tetanus were reported during the year under report. Bovine contagious disease. Rinderpest(4) The work performed on tour shows a satisfactory advance on previous years. The advantages and disadvantages of the itinerating system as at present in vogue are under consideration with a view to a more convenient method of working being adopted. Veterinary Hospitals(5) I do not advise putting out bulls in such districts unless respectable men voluntarily apply for them and promise to be responsible that they are properly looked after. (2) Equine (under Local Bodies). Replacement of stallions. 30. With the exception of Hazara, horse-breeding in all other dis- tricts and Agencies is under this Depart- ment. The sanctioned standard scale for this Province is 8 horse, 10 pony and 13 donkey stallions, but proposals for the increase of 2 donkeys, one each for the Kurram and Tochi Agencies, have been submitted to the Government of India by the Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province, and if they are accepted, there will be an addition of 2 donkeys to the existing scale. An indent for 8 donkey stallions was submitted during the year under report, but none have yet been supplied, as no stallions were available for this Province from the Hissar Farm. However, it is highly probable that the stallions in question will shortly be supplied, as arrangements are being made to get a number of Cyprian donkeys from Europe. A donkey stallion in the Kurram Agency was not included in the standard scale, and was therefore omitted in the previous year's report.

Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor General, North-West Frontier Province, No. 3934, dated 20th August 1908. READ(2) the Veterinary staff, however, has been sanctioned by the Government of India, and it is hoped that before the close of the present year the cadre will be brought up to its full strength; when this is effected there will be one stationary Assistant at each tahsil and one itinerating Assistant for each district, and this should be followed by a marked increase in the number of animals treated at the dispensaries. During the year a new hospital was completed at Bannu and new dis- pensaries were constructed at Mansehra, Miramshah and Purachnar: the building of a new hospital at Abbottabad was commenced(3) The Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan combined Horse and Cattle Show hell at Dera Ismail Khan was not so successful as in the previous year, the number of animals present showing a decided falling off, and the cattle in particular being described as of very inferior quality. It has now been decided to hold separate shows each year at Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan, and it remains to be seen whether the experiment will prove successful or the reverse. The second Cattle Show at Haripur was a complete success. The total number of animals which competed for prizes rose to 706 from 454 in the pre- vious year, the first year of the enterprise, and there was considerable buying and selling at fair prices. This Show has established itself upon a secure footing, and there is every reason to believe that it will increase yearly in popularity and produce good results in improving the stock of cattle throughout the district. 9. The subordinate Veterinary staff remained at the same sanctioned strength as in the previous year, but, as noted above, it will shortly be augment- ed by 6 itinerating Veterinary Assistants; and the three vacancies referred to in paragraph 48 of the Superintendent's Report have already been filled up. The increase in the pay of the Veterinary Assistants which was sanctioned by the Government of India in October 1907 has done much towards removing the former obstacles in the way of recruitment, and in future there should be little or no difficulty in obtaining the requisite number of trained and efficient Veterinary Assistants. The two Veterinary Inspectors and the subordinate staff are reported to have worked well during the year, and the report of the Superintendent affords ample proof of commendable progress and development throughout the Pro- vince. The question of the appointment of a separate Superintendent for the Province will be taken up in consultation with the Punjab Government at an early date. In conclusion the Chief Commissioner desires to record his thorough appreciation of the manner in which Captain Woodley performed his duties during the year and of the ready assistance afforded to him by all District Officers. ORDER.No. 220. FROM S. CARLESS, ESQUIRE, M.R.C.V.S., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province and North Punjab, To THE REVENUE COMMISSIONER, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE.

His head-quarters being at Rawalpindi, a considerable distance had to be travelled on every occasion he visited the Province. Work performed on tour. 2. During the year under report the Superintendent attended and acted as a member of the Judging Com- mittees at the following Horse and Cattle Fairs and Shows, concerning which reports were sent to the Deputy Commis- sioners concerned: (2) He inspected the following tonga lines:(3) Glanders(4) Preventive inoculation(5) Veterinary Hospitals(6) III(7) Number of horse and pony stallions in non-selected districts (8) (3) Others. Merino rams. 43. During the year under report 21 merino rams were indented for from Australia through the Inspector- General, Civil Veterinary Department, but these could not be supplied before the hot weather. However, it is expected that they will arrive in India during. October next. The two merino rams supplied to the Kurram Agency in February 1907 were transferred to the Tochi Agency in January 1908, as their services were not appreciated by the people of Kurram. As stated by the Political Agent, Kurram, a sum of Rs. 120 was spent on their up-keep for the year. Out of the five merino rams supplied to the Hazara District, one died in March 1908. The cause of death was said to be due to improper feeding. These animals are liked by the people. During the hot weather these rams were kept up in Kaghan, but they are brought down to Haripur for the cold season. (4) Fairs and Shows. Horse and Cattle Fairs and Shows(9) Discontinuance of Imperial prizes at Cattle Shows, 45. The Government of India have discontinued to contribute money from Imperial Revenues for the award of prizes at Cattle Shows, and have left it to the Local Governments and Local Bodies to provide money for this purpose from Provincial or Local Funds, as they think fit. IV.( 10 ) Vaccinations against black-quarter were commenced for the first time this year. For the next few years these operations will be confined to one area, and only in those villages where the disease annually exists. In this way it will be easier to carry out the vaccinations, to check the work being done, to watch the results, and to gain the confidence of the people. It will be a matter of two or three years probably before any definite results can be arrived at. For these operations the Kurram Agency has been selected, as the disease is very prevalent there. With regard to the experiments for improving the wool in certain places by the introduction of the merino rams, very little can be said at present. This will be the first lambing season, and as soon as the wool is available samples of it will be sent to the leading wool merchants for their expert opinion. By the orders of the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, the issue of hæmorrhagic septicæmia serum from the Laboratory was discon- tinued until the completion of some new experiments at the above institution. Owing to the enormous area under his charge both in the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province the Superintendent found it impossible to make prolonged tour under canvas, and until a separate Superintendent, Civil Veteri- nary Department, is appointed for this Province, it is practically out of the question. Touring slowly under canvas for an officer in the Department is essential, as it is only by this means he can become acquainted with the Zamindars, their customs and the local conditions. With his present charge there is not sufficient time to carry out special or even ordinary investigations into horse, mule, cattle and sheep breeding, and, more important, the suppression of contagious diseases. Although his tours during the year were somewhat hurried, still he was able to gain a good deal of information and to check the work of the subordinate staff. From the previous remarks it may be concluded that the working of the Department has not only been maintained, but that it has advanced to a great extent during the year under report. The Superintendent takes this opportunity of recording his thanks to all the District Revenue officials for the great help they have given him and for their hearty co-operation in furthering the interests of the Civil Veterinary Department. S. CARLESS, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province and North Punjab.

REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE. FOR THE YEAR 1908-09. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Peshawar: PRINTED AT THE "COMMERCIAL" PRESS BY D. C. ANAND & SONS, GOVT. PRINTERS, N.-W. F. PROVINCE. 1909.
Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General, North-West Frontier Province, No. 72 Ag., dated 20th August 1909. READ( 2 ) of cases treated in the hospitals rose from 10,620 to 14,174. The number of cases treated at the dispensaries rose from 6,388 to 7,175. The number of cases treated by Veterinary Assistants on tour rose from 6,059 to 12,185. The increases noticed are partly due to the increase in the number of assistants at work from 14 to 17. They point also to a steady development in veterinary work which the Chief Commissioner notices with satisfaction. The new arrangement under which there will be one stationary Veteri- nary Assistant at each Tahsil has so far been introduced only in Hazara. Its extension is in progress. The Hangu Dispensary and the Abbottabad Hospital were opened in the year, in which Rs. 6,500 were allotted from Imperial Funds for the con- struction of Veterinary Dispensaries. With the further allotments of the year 1909-10 the housing of the Veterinary Institutions in the Province should be materially improved. Breeding operations. 4. The number of stud bulls was increased from 11 to 14, while the number of horse and pony stallions remained the same, viz. 18. Three donkey stallions were sold dur- ing the year and the number now stands at 15. The number of mares covered by the various horse pony and donkey stallions rose from 1,412 to 1,482. The average cost of the feed and keep of each class of stallion given in Table XII again shows considerable variations from district to district, but recently definite instructions have been issued regarding the preparation of this state- ment. The present figures may be accepted as approximately correct. The introduction of merino rams into the Province, noticed in paragraph 7 of last year's review, is likely to prove a success. The breed is very much appreci- ated in Hazara where there are now 12 rams. Good results are also expected in Dera Ismail Khan, where there are four of these rams. The ram at Tochi has been transferred to Hazara since the close of the year : the rams are only useful where short tailed sheep are indigenous. The value of the wool of the new mixed breed for commercial purposes is not yet known. It is proposed that a consignment should be shortly sent to Cawnpore and examined there. Shows and Fairs. 5. The Horse and Cattle Fairs and Shows in the Province were on the whole successful. The Peshawar Show was well managed and was a distinct improvement on previous Shows. The Dera Ismail Khan Show was largely attended. The Bannu Show was confined to local exhibits. The Haripur Show was not well attended, as there were no separate classes for the hill cattle. In so far as the result of the breeding operations is to be gathered from the number and quality of the exhibits at the Shows, the use that is made of them and the prices that they command, the report might have contained more observations of interest. General. 6. Good work was done in the year. More remains to be done as the Department expands and its sphere enlarges. The co-operation of the District Officials, which is in- dispensable if the Department is to succeed, is warmly acknowledged by the Superintendent. ORDER.No. 211. FROM S. CARLESS, ESQUIRE, M. R. C.

He inspected horse boxes at Peshawar Railway Station. The work performed on tour by Mr. Carless was as follows. He inspected the following hospitals and dispensaries :( 3 ) Equine Contagious Disease. 10. Hazara being a selected district equine contagious disease in that district is dealt with by the Army Remount Department. Glanders( 4 ) Three thousand, six hundred and five vaccinations of susceptible animals were performed in 24 villages of the Peshawar District and Kurram Agency where the disease is regularly known to occur. The results are being carefully checked, and a report will be submitted in due course. Pillules for black-quarter vaccination have recently been prepared at the Muktesar Laboratory and indents for them will be submitted in future direct to the Imperial Bacteriologist. Anthrax( 5 ) The Abbottabad Hospital was completed and occupied during the year. At the Kohat Hospital, Veterinary Assistant's quarters and a cattle shed were added in addition to which an operating shed, and a place for slinging animals are required. The Dera Ismail Khan Hospital requires some minor improvements to make it according to the standard plan. The Serai Naurang Dispensary is located in a serai, but a new building is under construction. Teri Dispensary was constructed during the year. An operating shed and compound wall are still required. Hangu Dispensary is temporarily located in the tehsil buildings. A dispensary, godown, 2 menials quarters and 3 stables are being constructed on a selected site. The Tank Dispensary is in a serai the property of the Border Military Police, the situation is unfavourable for veterinary purposes. The Mardan Dispensary is in a Government serai which is unsuitable for the purpose. A new building on an approved site is wanted. The dispensary at Swabi was opened during the year, both an operating and cattle shed are required to make it complete. The Nowshera Dispensary is in a hired serai. A new building is to be constructed shortly. Receipts and expenditure( 6 ) The average number of mares covered was 61.87 and 50.5 respectively against 57.25 and 48.2 in the previous year. Cost of feed and keep( 7 ) Haripur Show. The number of exhibits was below the average, 344 animals competed for prizes against 706 last year. This was due to the non-attendance of the hill cattle from Abbottabad and Mansehra, owing to no separate classes being allotted for them. Next year it is intended to confine certain classes to this type of animal. Rs. 652 in addition to two silver medals were awarded as prizes. Dera Ismail Khan Show. The Show was a success and largely attended by people from all parts of the district. The arrangements for selecting and judging the animals were satisfactory. Rs. 730 and 550 were allotted for Horse and Cattle Shows respec- tively, Rs. 410 and 348 being actually awarded. 2 silver medals, viz., one for the best mare and one for the best cow were also awarded. Bannu Show. This year a separate Show was held here instead of the joint Dera Ismail Khan and Bannu Show. The cattle were in good condition, but only local animals were exhibited. Next year it is hoped that cattle from the interior of the district will attend. The exhibits in the equine classes were fair except the young stock which were in poor condition and had been neglected. Rs. 1,718 were allotted as prizes, Rs. 1,193 for horses and Rs. 525 for cattle : of which 925 and 510 were awarded. Two silver medals were given, one for the best mare and one for the best cow. Discontinuance of Imperial prizes at Cattle Shows. 42. In consequence of the discontinuance of Imperial prizes, all the Cattle Shows in the Province are now entirely sup- ported by the North-West Frontier Province Govern- ment and Local Funds.

The increase in the average cost of feed and keep, &c., under columns 2 and 6 is due to the dearness of provision, (2) the decrease in the average cost of feed and keep under column 4 is due to the increase of a pony lately purchased. (b). The increase in column 6 is due to the fact that more food was given to donkey stallion than usual in accordance with the instructions of Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, to Veterinary Assistant. (c). Reasons for the high average in column 4 are the same as given in Political Agent Kurram's No. 330 dated 16th December 1908, a copy of which was forwarded to the Revenue Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province, with this office No. 703, dated 20th February 1909. (d). The increase in the average cost of feed, &c., of the stallions is due to the higher rates of the articles of food.

REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE FOR THE YEAR 1909-10. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Peshawar PRINTED AT THE "COMMERCIAL" PRESS BY D. C. ANAND & SONS, GOVT. PRINTERS, N.-W. F. PROVINCE. 1910.
Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General, North-West Frontier Province, No. 476 Ag., dated Peshawar, the 29th August 1910. READ( 2 ) manner, the number of in-patients rising from 1,347 to 2,089 and that of out- patients from 20,004 to 37,244. The question of providing a compounder for each hospital is under con- sideration at the present moment, and if the Local Bodies find themselves able to incur the extra expenditure which will be involved, the closure of an institution will in future be avoided. It has also been suggested that in order to meet the extra expense the system of charging fees for all attendance shall be introduced and this point has been referred to the Local Bodies concerned for consideration. The construction of veterinaty buildings is being steadily pushed on, only a few buildings remaining incomplete. The most urgent need is for a new hos- pital at Peshawar. A considerable portion of the funds required for the purpose has already been provided and the actual work of construction will be commenced shortly. Funds have also been allotted to the Political Agent, Malakand, and a Veterinary Hospital has been constructed at Dargai. Breeding operations. 5. The number of bulls has increased from 14 to 19. More bulls are needed in every district, but there are difficulties in the way of working up to the full requirements. The Local Bodies are being invited to remedy this defect, and with the approaching completion of the veterinary buildings and their equip- ment the necessary funds should be easily forthcoming. The number of horse stallions rose from 8 to 10, but the number actually employed at stud was eight, the same as last year. At the close of the year the number of donkey stallions was 13 against 15 last year, but for the greater part of the year only 14 donkeys were actually employed. With the sanction of the Government of India one donkey stallion for Malakand has been added to the standard scale of the Pro- vince and will shortly be purchased. The total number of mares covered by horse, pony and donkey stallions rose from 1,482 to 1,707. The cost of feed and keep of the stallions in Tochi has been reduced. There are now 13 merino rams in Kagan. Wool should be available shortly and samples will be sent to Cawnpore. The anticipation expressed in paragraph 4 of last year's review regarding the four merino rams in Dera Ismail Khan has not been realised, and they have been transferred to Wana. Shows and Fairs. 6. Altogether 10 silver medals were awarded and Rs. 5,189 were spent on prizes in the various Horse and Cattle Shows of the Province. The Haripur, Peshawar and Bannu Shows were highly successful, but the Dera Ismail Khan Show was disappointing, the main cause for this was the selection of an unsuit- able date. 7. The sanctioned strength of the subordinate Veterinary Staff remained the same (26) as last year. The number actually employed, however, was only 23, but the three vacancies have since been filled up. General. The Chief Commissioner is glad to observe that the Veterinary Inspectors and Assistants are all reported to have worked well during the year, and he desires to record his appreciation of the manner in which Messrs. Woodley and Carless have performed their duties. The continued co-operation of the district officials in all matters affecting the interests of the Department, to which the Superin- tendent testifies, is a further matter for satisfaction. ORDER.No. 257. FROM S. CARLESS, ESQUIRE, M. R. C. V. S., Offg. Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North- West Frontier Province and North Punjab, Rawal Pindi, TO THE REVENUE COMMISSIONER, North- West Frontier Province, Peshawar. Dated Rawal Pindi, the 29th June 1910. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province, for the year 1909-10. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, S. CARLESS, Offg. Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province and North Punjab.
Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province, for the year 1909-10. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. Officers in charge. 1. Mr. Woodley held charge of the Civil Veterinary Administration of the North-West Frontier Province and North Punjab from the 1st of April to the 5th of May 1909, and again from the 6th of January 1910 to the end of the year. Mr. Carless officiated as Superintendent, from May 6th, 1909 to the 5th of January 1910. Extent and duration of tour. 2. During the year under report Mr. Woodley spent 44 days on tour and travelled 1,066 miles by rail and 878 by road. Mr. Carless was on tour in the Province for 35 days, and travelled 618 miles by rail and 264 by road. Work performed on tour. 3. During the year Mr. Woodley attended the Horse and Cattle Fairs at Dera Ismail Khan and Bannu, and acted as a member of the Judging Committee. He inspected all Veterinary Hospitals in the Bannu, Kohat and Dera Ismail Khan districts, and in the Kurram and Tochi agencies. He inspected the following Tonga lines:(2) Scholarship. 5. The Peshawar, Kohat, Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu and Hazara dist- ricts have each sent one student to the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore, who on qualifying, will be available for service in the Province. Training of Veterinary Assistants in inoculation. 6. During the year one Veterinary Assistant was deputed to the Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory at Muktesar to undergo a course of train- ing in inoculation. PART II.-TREATMENT OF DISEASES. Outbreaks of contagious disease. 7. During the year under report outbreaks of contagious disease were reported from all the districts of the Province and Kurram and Tochi agencies. Mortality.(3) Section I (b)(4) SECTION 2-OTHER DISEASE. Treatment of disease on tour(5) During the year six new bulls were purchased by the various districts and agencies of the Province. There was one fatality giving a total of 19 bulls at the close of the year. Supply and care of bulls. 34. The bull supply for the Province is almost entirely drawn from the Chakwal and Tallagang tehsils. The Dhanni bulls obtained from these places have been found to be the best suited to the requirements of the Pro- vince. The number of bulls at stud are quite inadequate, if any permanent results are to be obtained. Very little interest is taken by the District Boards in cattle breeding, and in many places there is difficulty in obtaining men will- ing to keep a District Board bull. Section 2.(6) In the Dera Ismail Khan district the conditions were found to be unsuit- able and little interest was taken in the experiment. The rams have been sent to Wana, where it is improbable they will be of any use. Favourable reports have been received from Kaghan, where the rams are appreciated. In the Kaghan valley the experiment properly looked after would be profitable, but further interest and supervision by district officers is indicated. Section 4.(7) Rs. 1,306 were awarded as prizes, Rs. 453 for cattle and Rs. 853 for equines in addition to which two silver medals were given, one for the best mare and one for the best bull. In the horse section the yearling and two year old fillies by District Board stallions were exceptionally good. The class for mares not covered by District Board stallions was strong in number and contained some quite useful animals. Several breeders, in this part of the country, will not use the Arab sire, as they are said to get small stock. In the cattle section 236 animals entered the ring for competition generally speaking the classes were only moderate. SUBORDINATE ESTABLISHMENT. 44. At the end of the year under report the subordinate staff consisted of 25 men as detailed below:(8) Owing to the enormous area under his control in the North Punjab and North-West Frontier Province, the Superintendent has found it impossible to go into the question of cattle breeding to any extent, but it was noticed that in those places where there are District Board bulls of the Dhanni breed, their influence has been shown on the indigenous cattle. The Superintendent takes this opportunity of recording his thanks to all the district Revenue Officials for the great help they have given him and for their hearty co-operation in furthering the interests of the Civil Veterinary Department.

In conclusion the Chief Commissioner desires to express his appre- ciation of the good work performed by the officers of the department during the year. ORDER.No. 238. FROM V. DE. V. H. WOODLEY, ESQUIRE, M. R. C. V. S., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North- West Frontier Province and North Punjab, Rawal Pindi, To THE REVENUE COMMISSIONER, North- West Frontier Province, Peshawar. Dated Rawal Pindi, the 2nd July 1912. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province, for the year 1911-1912. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant, V. DE V. H. WOODLEY, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province and. North Punjab.
Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province, for the year ending 31st March 1912. PART I.( 2 ) Examination and collection of specimens. 5. During the year 51 pathological specimens were submitted by the subordinate veterinary staff of which 25 and 26 were examined by Messrs. Cattell and Woodley, respectively. Maps showing the distribution of disease. 6. As usual maps showing the distribution of epidemic diseases that prevailed in the North-West Frontier Province were prepared and submitted to the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, but in consequence of the abolition of the office of the said officer such maps will not be submitted hence- forward. Section I (a).( 3 ) Foot and mouth disease.( 4 ) Buildings. 25. Peshawar District.( 5 ) Section II.( 6 ) Training in inoculation. 35. During the year under report 2 Veterinary Assistants were sent to Bareilly, United Provinces, for training in inoculation work. Work of subordinate establishment. 36. On the whole the work of the subordinates is considered satis- factory and they gave very little trouble. Only one Veterinary Assistant was dis- missed during the year. The Department was one man short at the close of the year hut it has since reached its full strength and with the scholarship men studying at the Punjab Veterinary College there should be no difficulty in getting candidates in future. Of the two Veterinary Inspectors in the Province, Veterinary Inspector Dost Mohammed Khan in charge of the Peshawar Division worked very well, he has a good knowledge of his districts, the inhabitants and the men under his charge. Training of local men in the Punjab Veterinary College 37. Out of the five men deputed from the various District Boards of North-West Frontier Province only two have passed the final examination and the remaining three having passed the examination of the second year class are promoted to the final class. PART V.( 7 ) 43. There is difficulty in obtaining donkey stallions and the Hissar Farm did not comply with the annual indent. The difficulty in future will probably be increased as the Hissar Farm has recently been handed ever to the Punjab Government and it is likely that the stallions will all be reserved for that pro- vince. The matter has already been referred to the Revenue Commissioner. There is also difficulty in obtaining horse stallions for District Boards as these bodies are unable to provide the funds to purchase Arabs in the Bombay market. Country breds may take their place in time but so far it is very difficult to get a really good animal fit for breeding purposes. The Superintendent has been trying to purchase locally suitable Arabs which have broken down in racing or polo but they generally are too small. 44. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, desires to appeal to all district officials to visit, as often as convenient, while they are on tour, all hospitals and stallion stands and to record a few notes in the visitors' books kept for that purpose, and also to impress on leading Zamindars the usefulness of these institutions and more especially to report at once on the first appearance of an outbreak of contagious disease. Reports of disease are often received too late for any useful action to be taken. Out of 315 outbreaks reported by Patwaries 100 were reported after the disease had actually died out. 45. It is an admitted fact that the charge of the North Punjab and North-West Frontier Province Circles is too large for one Superintendent and little more than ordinary administration can be done under the circumstances. The Frontier Government have recognised this and asked the Secretary of State for a separate officer for the Province. The Superintendent although he was absent from head-quarters on tour for six months could only perform his tour in a hurried manner and much of this time was spent in ordinary routine office work. He concludes by recording his thanks to all the district officers for their assistance and courtesy rendered to him in the performance of his duties. V. DE. V. H. WOODLEY, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North- West Frontier Province and North Punjab.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31stMARCH 1913. PART I.(2) PART II(3) Hæmorrhagic septicæmia.(4) SECTION III.(5) PART III (6) There was a slight increase in the number of animals competing for prizes, viz. 940 against 934, during the year 1910-11. (No Show was held during the preceding year, 1911-12, on account of scarcity of fodder.) Cattle Fairs and Shows.( 7 ) GENERAL REMARKS. 38. The results on the work of the year may be considered as most satisfactory. A similar remark was made last year, but during the year under report the number of animals attacked with contagious diseases has decreased by 5,629 cases, and the mortality therefrom by 1,749. Breeding operations, chiefly horse and sheep, have improved and increased. 39. Preventive inoculations and vaccinations show a large increase on previous years, and in most places the people readily adopt it. In some cases it appears that inoculations were begun too late, and by that time most, if not all, the susceptible animals had died or taken the disease and only the immune animals were left, consequently in such cases inoculation is of little use. Reports of outbreaks are often received too late, and the Veterinary Assistant through ignorance or carelessness inoculates when it is unnecessary, and hence a certain amount of serum is wasted. Statistical results of inoculations in these cases look very well on paper, but probably they would be different if the inoculation had been started at the very beginning of the outbreak. More promptness in reporting by the patwari, the early performance of inoculation, and strict superior supervision are the three great factors necessary for better results. 40. Horse-breeding is flourishing and great keenness is shown by the people of Bannu, Peshawar and the Kurram Agency. The standard scale of horse stallions has been increased by one in the Kurram Agency. Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan also require an extra stallion each. The Political Agent of the Kurram Agency intends holding an annual Horse and Cattle Show in future. This Agency is very subject to the ravages of cattle diseases, and consequently the Veterinary Assistant at Parachinar is frequently having to go on tour. The Superintendent is of the opinion that an Itinerating Veterinary Assistant is urgently required for this work with his head-quarters and a branch dispensary at Saddar or Alizai. A new stallion stable consisting of one horse and one donkey has recently been opened at Alizai. The thorough-bred Australian stallion which was supplied to the Bannu District through the Quartermaster-General was found on arrival to be hereditarily unsound, and consequently he was not allowed to be used for stud purposes. An enquiry is being made by the Deputy Commissioner. Three donkey stallions were supplied by the Hissar Farm during the year at a cost of Rs. 600 each; the price previous to this used to be Rs. 450. They were a poor lot of animals, and the only ones available at the time. Donkeys similar to this lot can be got in the local market for about Rs. 150 each. One of the Hissar bred donkeys received in February 1911 had to be cast as he refused to cover, and one out of the new lot received in December 1912 is a similar failure. This is the third case which has come under the notice of the Superintendent within the last year. 41. The Superintendent toured in Kaghan during last June and July in connection with the merino sheep-breeding experiments, and submitted his report on the same to the Revenue Commissioner. The breeding results were most encouraging and satisfactory. There were then close on 300 cross-bred lambs. The Dhariwal Woollen Mills Company, to whom a sample of the cross- bred wool was sent, expressed the opinion that it was the finest sample they had yet seen in India. The question of opening up a wool trade with Kaghan is being considered by this company, and they were kind enough to offer Rs. 200 for prizes in connection with a Sheep Show to be held during the coming year. This offer was accepted and agreed to by the Deputy Commis- sioner, Hazara, but unfortunately the Show had to be cancelled, as the Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department, could not perform the journey owing
( 8 ) to objections from the Accountant-General's Office. The matter is most regret- table, as the experiment should receive every encouragement in the initial stage, which has so far proved very promising. 42. The Superintendent again records the unsatisfactory way in which he has to perform his work and carry out inspections in such a hurried manner owing to the large extent of his circle both in the Punjab and the North-West Frontier Province, but he notes with pleasure that a separate officer will probably be sanctioned during the coming year for the North-West Frontier Province alone.

Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General, North-West Frontier Province,( 2 ) 9. In conclusion, the Chief Commissioner is pleased to acknowledge with thanks the good work done during the year by Mr. Woodley and his subordinates. ORDER.No. 259. FROM D. MEADOWS, ESQUIRE, M.R.C.V.S., Offg. Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province and North Punjab; To THE REVENUE COMMISSIONER, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE. Dated Rawalpindi, 26th June 1914. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province, for the year 1913-14. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, D. MEADOWS, Offg. Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province and North Punjab.
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31ST MARCH 1914 PART I.( 2 ) He also attended the Agricultural Show at Taru, district Peshawar, and assisted in the judging. He purchased one donkey stallion locally for the Peshawar District and one for Dera Ismail Khan from the Hissar Cattle Farm. At the request of the Superintendent of Police, Peshawar, he inspected all the Police horses which were collected for that purpose in Peshawar. Mr. Woodley interviewed the Revenue Commissioner on various occasions for discussing veterinary matters. As usual, during the course of his tours, he interviewed District and Agency Officers and inspected stud bulls and 16 stallion stands. Work performed on tour by Mr. Meadows. 4. He accompanied Mr. Woodley to Peshawar for the purpose of inspecting the Police chargers and made surprise visit to veterinary hospi- tal and stallion stand at Kohat.

Bannu and Serai Naurang are complete. Dera Ismail Khan District. Chaudhwan requires stallion and segregation stables.

Two candidates deputed from the Kurram Agency and Dera Ismail Khan District came out successful in the last final examination of the Punjab Veterinary College and there being no vacancy in the Province, consequently neither of them could be appointed, but their names have, however, been registered for any vacancy occurring in the near future. A candidate deputed from Hazara District is still studying in the above college. Work of subordinate veterinary establishment. 36. The two Veterinary Inspectors have done good work, but the circle under the Veterinary Inspector, Bannu Division, is very scattered, viz. Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan, Kohat, Kurram Agency and Tochi Agency; consequently a lot of his time is wasted in doing long journey, where he should be going from village to village and paying more attention to the supervision of the Veterinary Assistant's work. During the year under report one Veterinary Assistant resigned and two were discharged. PART V.( 8 ) Bannu Hospital was looted and a valuable horse stolen, besides some of the hospital property. Several hospitals are still without chaukidars. In the opinion of the Superintendent and the horse-breeders it is consi- dered that the young Arab stock in all the non-selected districts of the Province are not improving. All the most experienced breeders are now against the Arab stallions. The Arab has been used since 1901 and the stock is undoubted- ly deteriorating. The progeny are small and weedy and seldom grow into any useful size. All the districts have requested to be supplied with English or Australian horses. District Boards would readily assist but the difficulty is the price, and special arrangements must be made for importing such stallions. A thorough-bred English by St. Frusquin, one of the leading stallions at home, has recently been purchased for Dera Ismail Khan. Bannu has already got an Australian thorough-bred. District Boards require Government help for the purchase of these animals. A new annual Horse Show has been started at Parachinar and was held in May 1913. Mr. Woodley was unable to attend as the existing rules will only permit his going once to and from a hill station and drawing travelling allowance during the hot weather. The Superintendent has experienced considerable difficulty in realizing travelling allowance for special journeys to or near hill tracts in connection with outbreaks of contagious disease during the hot weather. Special sanction of the Government has to be applied for. The rules as affecting the Civil Veterinary Department require special modification. Merinos. It is regretted that little is known how the experiment is working out in Kaghan. The Superintendent toured there in 1912. The prospects were most promising then and the progeny numbered about 300: many of these were magnificient specimens with splendid wool which was reported on most favour- ably by the Dhariwal Woollen Mills Company. On that occasion the Account- ant-General raised objection to the Superintendent's tour, and it was only after 15 months that some of the travelling allowance bill was passed. The Dhari- wal Woollen Mills Company offered Rs. 200 for prizes in a show last year. The Superintendent intended touring there again, but as the sanction of the Local Government was not received in time for the Superintendent to proceed there, he abandoned the tour. Little now is known how the breeding experi- ments are going on, and none of the District Officials inspected the sheep during the year. The office work continues to increase. During the year under report there was an increase of 1,628 in the number of English and Vernacular letters received as compared with the previous year and of 658 in the number of letters despatched. The work of the clerical staff during the year has been satisfactory. The long anticipated sanction for a separate Civil Veterinary Depart- ment Officer for the North-West Frontier Province has not been received yet, which is a matter of great regret, and the Superintendent still feels that he is not doing justice to his work in having to perform his tours in such a hurried and unsatisfactory manner, besides there being considerable inconvenience in serving under the control of two separate Provinces and Administrations. There is more work to be done in the North-West Frontier Province than in the North Punjab Circle and it is difficult to expect the Superintendent to dis- tribute his tours equally in both Provinces. The Superintendent records his thanks for the hearty assistance he has received from District Officers and District Boards in the course of tours. D. MEADOWS, Offg.

Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General, North-West Frontier Province, No. 823-Ag., dated 31st August 1915. READ(2) altogether satisfactory that Veterinary Assistants on tour only visited 1,459 villa- ges and treated 15,456 animals as compared with 1,504 villages and 23,028 ani- mals last year, while castration was performed only in 501 cases as against 635 last year. The decrease in the aggregate work carried out on tour is said to be due to the transfer of two Veterinary Assistants to Military duty, but as they were not warned for field service until November this does not fully explain the falling off. Finality in the building and equipment of hospitals has not of course been reached, but some important additions were carried out to those in Charsadda, Swabi and Nowshera, and the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that Local Bodies keep the needs of their Veterinary Institutions in mind subject to their financial ability to meet fresh expenditure. 6. No change was made during the year in the sanctioned scale of stallions. 12 horse, 7 pony and 17 donkey stallions were actually employed at studNo. 242. FROM D. MEADOWS, ESQUIRE, M.R.C.V.S., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North- West Frontier Province and North Punjab, TO THE REVENUE COMMISSIONER, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, Peshawar. Dated Rawalpindi, 22nd June 1915. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province, for the year 1914-15. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, D. MEADOWS, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North- West Frontier Province and North Punjab.
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERI- NARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31ST MARCH 1915. PART I(2) He made an extended tour in the Kagan Valley in connection with merino sheep breeding and submitted his report to the Deputy Commissioner, Hazara, and Revenue Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province. He personally went down to Hissar for selecting a donkey stallion for the Tochi Agency. The Superintendent interviewed Revenue Commissioner for discussing veterinary matters and as usual during the course of his tours he interview- ed District and Agency Officers and inspected bulls and stallions where they were. PART II.(3) 938 cases and 385 deaths last year. It is noteworthy that although this disease was less prevalent during the year under report the proportionate mortality was higher. The same state of affairs has been noticed in the North Punjab Circle. Preventive inoculations. 11. During the year under report 2,689 animals were inoculated in 12 outbreaks against 6,409 in 30 out- breaks last year. Rs. 954-2-0 were paid by Government on account of cost of anti-rinderpest serum as compared with Rs. 828-4-0 paid in the previous year. The decrease in inoculations is due to the reason stated in paragraph 10 above. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia. 12. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia was reported from three ditsricts and one agency of the Province, viz. Peshawar, Hazara, Dera Ismail Khan and Kurram. 4,214 cases were reported, of which 1,024 proved fatal, compared with 491 cases and 407 deaths last year. The greater incidence recorded was probably due to unusual climatic conditions and perhaps to some extent to better reporting. Preventive vaccination.(4) SECTION I (C).(5) Kohat District. Kohat and Hangu.(6) in the southern districts where a perverted taste in horses exists. The late Superintendent recommended the use of thorough-bred stallions and a start of these lines was made but the early results were unfortunate and recent experience has shown that thorough-bred stallions will not thrive and be useful, in fact they will often die in the intense heat of the southern parts of the Province. The District Board can hardly be asked to summer their thorough-bred stallions in the hills as the Army Remount Department do, as the cost would be excessive and the stallions would then be of little benefit to the country as the early hot weather is the time when they are most needed. I would recommend that the experiments of using thorough-bred stallions be proceeded with cautiously and that it be tried in the northern parts of the province first. The Arab has not done badly for the country, for although a lot of their stock are too small for Army requirements, they are useful for harness or pack work and not useless for any purpose like some of the oversized and badly formed produce of the thorough-bred. Service of stallions.(7) PART IV(8) The reason for this state of affairs appears to be the smallness- of prospects and the recent lengthening of the period of study and the raising of the standard of general education required without a corresponding increase of pay and prospects. On the outbreak of the present war II Veterinary Assistants (out of which 2 were taken for Military duty) and one Veterinary Inspector volunteered for Military Service and the staff generally showed readiness to do their part if called on. There were 49 complaints against Patwaris for reporting contagious diseases late or not at all. Last year they were 30. Miramshah Veterinary Hospital was looted and the greater part of the equipment destroyed during the raid on the Miramshah Bazar. The damage has since been made good. The work of the clerical staff although very heavy, has been very satisfactorily done. Attention is drawn to the remarks on breeding. The Superintendent wishes to record his thanks to District and Agency officials for the assistance given to him and to his staff in the course of their work. D. MEADOWS, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North- West Frontier Province and North Punjab.

Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General, North-West Frontier Province,(2) village headman, and it is very doubtful whether an increase in efficiency would result. The existing arrangement appears on the whole adequate if properly worked. 6. The number of hospitals was 19 as before. 56,003 animals were treat- ed in these institutions against 58,617 cases last year. Though less touring was performed by Veterinary Assistants, they treated 16,728 animals as compared with 14,955 animals and performed 687 castrations on tour against 501 last year. The quantity of work shows an increase, therefore, which the Chief Commis- sioner is glad to observe in view of the falling off noticed in the last review. Additions and extensions to certan hospitals are still wanted and these should receive the attention of Local Bodies in due course. 7. No progress has been made in breeding operations during the year. The Province had two horse stallions and one donkey stallion less than the sanctioned number, though there were 11 stud bulls at work as compared with eight last year. The Chief Commissioner, however, does not anticipate much improvement in this branch of the work of the Department until the closer attention, which it requires, can be devoted to it on the appointment of a whole-time Superintendent for the Province. 8. Horse Shows and Cattle Fairs were held during the year in all the districts except Dera Ismail Khan, where, owing to scarcity of fodder, no show could be arranged. Shows were generally well attended and the gatherings continued popular. The expenditure involved is not very large and we can afford to wait for definite results to manifest themselves in the improvement of stock. 9. Mr. Meadows held charge of the Department throughout the year. The record of work performed by him, which is given in Part I of his Report, shows that he has endeavoured as far as possible to cope with his dual charge and the acknowledgments of the Chief Commissioner are due to him for his administration of the Department. ORDER.No. 300-3-F.-III. FROM D. MEADOWS, ESQUIRE, M.R.C.V.S., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province and North Punjab. To THE REVENUE COMMISSIONER, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, PESHAWAR. Dated Rawalpindi, 17th June 1916. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province, for the year 1915-16. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, D. MEADOWS, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province and North Punjab.
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, FOR THE YEAR 1915-16. PART I.(2) The Superintendent was also able to purchase two donkey stallions locally, one each for Bannu and Peshawar districts. PART II.(3) Foot-and-mouth disease.(4) No additions are just at present required to the buildings of Veterinary hospitals in Bannu and Kohat districts and Kurram, Tochi and Malakand Agencies. In the Dera Ismail Khan District, Tank requires buildings after the standard plan, as the present building is not suitable, being only a small house and courtyard in an old serai. PART III.(5) PART IV.-SUBORDINATE STAFF. Numerical strength (6) The decrease in the services of the stallions can be ascribed to the year of scarcity. The great decrease in the incidence of glanders can only be regarded as temporary, being due largely to vigorous searching for cases the previous year and to climatic influences (dry season) being unfavourable to its spread. The North-West Frontier Province is now threatened with dourine, which has recently been found in Baluchistan and the Dera Gazi Khan District of the Punjab. A sharp look-out for the disease is being kept, but it will be extremely difficult to find the outbreaks early, as the disease in the adjoining territories has taken a very mild and chronic form, which is very difficult to diagnose. With the exception of foot-and-mouth disease and rinderpest (the increase in the latter was in one locality onlyTABLE I.

Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor General, North-West Frontier Province.-No. 2062-Ag., dated 23rd August 1920. READ(2) 5. There were 17 horse and 17 donkey stallions at the end of the year, or 5 horse stallions and 3 donkey stallions short of the sanctioned strength. The deficiency in the Peshawar and Kohat districts is due to thefts by raiders during the Afghan War. A valuable thorough-bred horse was taken from Peshawar and sold in Jalalabad and one pony and two donkey stallions were lost in the same way. It is doubtful if funds can be found to bring the stud up to full strength in the current year. 14 horse, 5 pony and 18 donkey stallions were actually employed at stud and covered 1,747 mares as against 1,782 in the preceding year. 6 As noted in last year's report District Boards continue to take a lively interest in cattle-breeding. Of 10 and 5 bulls indented for last year by the Peshawar and Dera Ismail Khan districts 6 and 4 respectively were obtained. Special classes and prizes have been introduced in the cattle fairs for the stock of District Boards bulls. The Awankari herd, which was started with 10 cows and a stud bull at Tarnab in 1913, now comprises 42 pure bred Awankari animals. They are in excellent condition and are fine typical animals. Six young bulls are now ready for service in the districts and will be offered to the Veterinary Department on payment for distribution to the various District Boards 7. As regards sheep-breeding there is little to record of the Haznra Merino flock. Of the 17 three-quarter bred rams remaining from last year 2 died. The Tarnab Farm flock has made good progress. The Pushti-Kuh ram died last autumn leaving a fine flock of lambs. The flock has been carefully observed and records of its progress have been kept. The live weight of the pure imported Pushti-Kuh ram at Tarnab was 170 lbs. at 4 years. His fleece weighed fully 4 lbs. Some of his ram lambs aged 14 to 15 months were weighed and sheared during the year. They weighed from 111 lbs. to 145 lbs. and their fleece weighed from 1 3/4 lbs. and 2½ lbs, at the age of 14½ to 15½ months. It is clear that the best Pushti-Kuh Hashtnagri ram will eventually weigh far heavier than the pure imported Pushti-Kuh ram. The lambs that weigh 125-126 lbs. at 15 months will certainly weigh about 200 lbs. at 4 years. The fleece is far superior to that of the pure Hashtnagri ram. The fleeces of all the animals have been sent to the Egerton Woollen Mills for valuation, and the result will be noted in the next report. The flock owners of the Peshawar District chiefly breed for mutton and early maturity of the lambs, which they try to market at 4 or 5 months. The wool to them is of comparatively little value. The new cross breed is, therefore, likely to become very popular for the sake of the mutton. 14 Pushti-Kuh Hashtnagri rams were available at the Tarnab Farm, and of these 10 are being allotted to the Pe-hawar and 4 to the Kohat District for breeding purposes. 8 The appointment of a whole-time Superintendent of the Civil Veterinary Department of this Province was sanctioned by the Secretary of State in 1915, but no suitable candidate could be found in consequence of the war. The post has now been filled temporarily by the appointment of Mr. Garewal, and it is hoped that the Department will next year show great improvement as a result of receiving his undivided attention. 9. In conclusion the Chief Commissioner is pleased to acknowledge the good work done by Mr. Garewal and his subordinates during the year. By order of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General, H. N. BOLTON, Revenue Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province. N. W. F. P. Govt.

D., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province and North Punjab, Rawalpindi, To THE REVENUE COMMISSIONER, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, PESHAWAR. Dated Rawalpindi, the 5th July 1920. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Annual Report (in dupli- cate) of the Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province, for the year 1919-20.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, FOR THE YEAR 1919-20. PART I.(2) PART II.(3) Preventive inoculation (4) The buildings at Tank to which the Veterinary Hospital was taken at first being in an out-of-way and dangerous locality, the hospital was taken to the rest-house. The Veterinary Hospital and stallion stables at Tochi were closed in the beginning of the year owing to the depredations of the lawless Frontier tribes. The following additions to the different Veterinary Hospitals are urgently required:(5) SECTION II.(6) GENERAL REMARKS. During the year under report the staff has been kept particularly busy in dealing with the large number of outbreaks of contagious disease, especially rinderpest, which was very prevalent throughout the entire circle. Great credit is due to Veterinary Assistants for the willingness displayed in dealing with the large amount of extra work thrown on them, the majority of whom have worked very satisfactorily. In the absence of efficient legislation to deal with outbreaks of con- tagious diseases very little head-way can be made to reduce the prevalence of contagious disease in this country, which is accountable for such a heavy mortality. Though inoculation is getting very popular every year in villages where people are now willingly bringing their animals forward for inocula- tion, still I am strongly of opinion that certain measures in the way of legislation should be adopted as early as possible to limit the movement of diseased animals from one place to another to check the further spread of any contagious disease, and until and unless steps are taken in this direction, I am afraid we cannot succeed in stamping out any contagious disease from the Province. A separate Superintendent for the North-West Frontier Province should be appointed as early as possible to enable him to devote the whole of his time for the Frontier Province. At present he is too much over-worked, and, apart from holding the charge of the North Punjab Circle along with the Frontier Province, he is also carrying on a special Dhanni breeding scheme in Chakwal, Tallagang and Gujar Khan tahsils of Jhelum, Attock and Rawalpindi districts. The work has immensely increased lately though no increase in the clerical staff has been made so far. I would again emphasise the necessity of increasing the number of Veterinary Assistants working in the districts. The extension of horse and cattle breeding will demand very close supervision, for which the present sanctioned staff will be altogether inadequate. As usual during the year the Veterinary staff were kept well informed of any matters of professional interest which were considered necessary to keep them up to date in their professional work. The Superintendent wishes to express his thanks to District Officers for the help given by them to him and the staff in carrying on their work. J. S.

Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General, North-West Frontier Province, No. 1017-Rev.., dated 7th October 1921. READ:the Dhani bulls are much appreciated by the people of the frontier, who show an increasing tendency to act on the advice of the officers of the Department. Special classes and prizes have been introduced at Cattle Fairs for the stock of District Board bulls. During the year under report 16 buffalo-bulls were pur- chased from the Ferozepore District for breeding and of these 8 were supplied to the Peshawar District, 5 to Bannu and 3 to Hazara. It is hoped that good results will be achieved. The Awankari herd at Tarnab makes good progress but the 6 young bulls offered to the Civil Veterinary Department for dis- tribution to the various District Boards on payment, were rejected by the Superintendent as not being of the true Awankari breed. The matter is being enquired into. 7. The stock of merino rams in Kaghan is diminishing as there is now only one ram and one ewe. There were 15 three-quarter bred rams in the Hazara District at the close of last year and of these 4 died. The Superintend- ent urges the necessity of more three-quarter or half-bred rams for the Hazara District and the Chief Commissioner hopes that the District Board will see its way to provide funds for this purpose. The cost of importing pure merino rams and ewes is no doubt prohibitive at present. The stock of Pusht-i-Kuh rams at Tarnab is doing well. A report from the Egerton Woollen Mills on the quality of the fleece of these animals is still awaited and the results will be noted in the next report. 8. The Superintendent's remarks regarding legislation to deal with cattle disease will be borne in mind but the Chief Commissioner is doubtful if public opinion among owners and breeders is yet educated enough to accept restrictions similar to those imposed in more advanced countries. Moreover the present financial situation makes it impossible to provide the extra staff that would be required to enforce such regulations. 9. During the year under report the post of the whole-time Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department, for the North-West Frontier Pro- vince, was temporarily filled with the approval of the Government of India by the appointment of Mr. Garewal. But owing to the stringency of funds the provision for the separate Superintendent, Civil Veterenary Department, and his staff was cut out by the Government of India and hence the creation of the new Civil Veterinary Department office for this Province had to be post- poned this year. 10. The Chief Commissioner desires to acknowledge the good work done by Mr. Garewal and his subordinates during the year. By order of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General, H. N. BOLTON, Revenue Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province. N.W. F. P. Govt. Press, PeshawarNo. 492. FROM J. S. GAREWAL, ESQUIRE, M.R.C.V.S., I. C. V. D. Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North West Frontier Province and North Punjab, Rawalpindi. To THE REVENUE COMMISSIONER, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, NATHIAGALI. Dated Rawalpindi, the 28th July 1921. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit herewith, in duplicate, the Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province, for the year 1920-21. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, J. S. GAREWAL, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province and North Punjab.
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE FOR THE YEAR 1920-21. PART I.(2) On the recommendation of the Deputy Commissioner in charge of Dera Ismail Khan District no Horse Show and Cattle Fair was held in Dera Ismail Khan during the year under report. Reports on different Fairs held in the Province were sent to the Deputy Commissioners concerned, and, in spite of great scarcity of fodder, these Shows were, on the whole, well attended. At Haripur and Peshawar Cattle Fairs, the stock of the Dhanni bulls working in these districts was seen for the first time, and was very good. A thorough-bred horse stallion was purchased by the Superintendent from Calcutta for Peshawar District. Four Donkey stallions were purchased from the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, after being selected by the Superintendent. Nineteen Dhanni bulls were purchased. All the District Board and Government stallions in the Province were inspected. The Superintendent also attended a special meeting held at Lahore Secretariat to consider the question of reduction in the number of cattle in the Province and the measures to be taken for improving the various breeds of cattle, which were more or less disappearing. PART II.(3) Glanders is still prevalent in the Province and experience has shown that a number of diseased animals are employed. In cases where the owner knows of the existence of the disease and fears detection he sometimes employs the animal only at night. A careful search for infected animals was made at the various Shows and Fairs in the Province but an organized search cannot be made with the existing staff. With a view to stamping out the disease it is suggested that all animals should be examined by a Veterinary Officer before being licensed to ply in tongas and tumtums. The services of a Veterinary Inspector could be made available at the time of licensing. Anthrax.(4) to the Veterinary Assistant, Swabi, were lost in transit and did not reach the destination, about which correspondence is still going on with the railway authorities. Foot-and-Mouth disease(5) Haripur ... Verandah newly constructed. Serai Naurang ... Stable for thorough-bred stallion built. Swabi ... A verandah built in Veterinary Assistant's quarters. Hangu ... New contagious ward provided. Parachinar and Dera Ismail Khan ... At both these places verandahs provided. The plans and estimates for the proposed dog kennels at Abbottabad Veterinary Hospital have been prepared. Plans have been approved and Revenue Commissioner addressed for funds. Necessary arrangement is being made for land at Mansehra in order to build Zamindar quarters and contagious ward. It is hoped that the building will be completed during next year. Most of the additions and alterations enumerated in the last year's report are still required. SECTION 1.-BOVINES. Stud bulls.(6) A scheme was put forward for buying 24 of the best rams and distributing them among owners possessing flocks of good quantity in order to improve the local breed but funds have so far not been available for carrying out the scheme. Some fine Pusht-i-Kuh rams were seen at the Government Farm at Tarnab. A number of these have been distributed by the Agricultural Officer without reference to this Department. It is understood that they were all distributed in the Peshawar District instead of in the Province generally to the detriment of the other districts. It is suggested that in future the rams should be distributed through the Veterinary Department. SECTION 2.(7) There was no increase in the number of the subordinate Veterinary staff during the year under report except for a very short period, when establishment for the separate office of the Superintendent, North-West Frontier Province, was engaged and then one Veterinary Inspector was sanctioned for the office, but it was disbanded at very short notice as the separation of the two circles was further postponed and the strength of the staff reduced to the previously sanctioned scale before the end of the year under report. No local men were sent for training in the Punjab Veterinary College this year. PART V.(8) men might be available to be sent to the scene of outbreaks without leaving the Veterinary Hospitals in charge of compounders. I should like to emphasize again the importance of legislation to deal with outbreaks of contagious disease. Though inoculation is growing in popularity little can be done to check the spread of disease unless power is given to prevent the movement of diseased or infected animals from place to place. The Superintendent wishes to express his thanks to District Officers for the help given by them to him and the staff in carrying on the work. J. S.

REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE FOR THE YEAR 1921-22 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Price-Re. 0-14-0. PESHAWAR: NORTH-WEST PRCNTIER PROVINCE GOVERNMENT PRESS. 1922.
Proccedings of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General, North-West Frontier Province, No. 671-Rev., dated 11th September 1922. READ:(2) Of these 3 were supplied to the Hazara District, 7 to Peshawar and 5 to Bannu. The Superintendent remarks that more bulls are required for the improvement of cattle-breeding in the Province, and the Chief Commissioner hopes that District Boards will see their way to help in this direction. The Awankari herd at Tarnab is doing well. 7. It was noted in last year's report that the stock of pure-bred Merino sheep in the Kaghan Valley was diminishing, there being then only 1 ram and 1 ewe left. It is not clear whether these also have died. The number of half-bred rams in the Hazara District now stands at 6 as against 11 in the previous year. The Superintendent again urges the necessity of importing more pure-bred rams for this district, but the cost is prohibitive, and for the present advantage must be taken of half and three-quarter bred animals which can be procured in the country. The Pusht-i-Kuh rams raised at the Tarnab Farm are proving satis- factory. The report from the Egerton Woollen Mills on the quality of the fleece of these animals is still awaited. Two Pusht-i-Kuh rams were ordered from Mesopotamia during the year under review, but unfortunately one of them died on the voyage while the other proved to be not of the required type, The Agricultural Officer reports, however, that this animal will prove very useful for breeding purposes in the Kurram Agency. For experimental purposes, 2 he-goats of the Barbari breed from Gujrat were purchased for the Hazara District and the results will be interesting to watch. 8. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, has again urged the great necessity for legislation to deal with segregation in connection with cattle diseases. The remarks made in last year's review still have equal, if not greater, force. Paucity of funds make the proposals impossible, should they prove entirely practical. 9. For similar reasons it has been impossible to create a separate Civil Veterinary Department with a whole-time Superintendent in charge, as was foreshadowed in the review for last year. 10. In conclusion, the Chief Commissioner is pleased to acknowledge with thanks the good work done during the year by Mr. Garewal and his staff. By order of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General, E. H. S. JAMES, LIEUT.-COLONEL, Revenue Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province.
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, FOR THE YEAR 1921-22. PART I(2) time of an outbreak of any disease whether contagious or non-contagious, and as regards the measures which should be adopted to check the further spread of disease amongst equines or bovines, etc., etc. Such propaganda work will, it is hoped, bear good results. The work done by the staffs at Veterinary Hospitals as well as on tour was checked. As usual, during the course of his tours, the Superintendent interviewed the Revenue Commissioner, Deputy Commissioners, Political Agents and other District Officers and leading Zamindars regarding matters of veterinary interest. The Superintendent acted as a Member of the Judging Committee at the Peshawar Horse Show and Cattle Fair. The Kohat, Haripur and Bannu Horse Shows and Cattle Fairs were not held during the year under report. The Superintendent was unable to attend the Dera Ismail Khan Horse Show and Cattle Fair on account of his absence at Pusa (Bihar) to attend the meeting of the Board of Agriculture. A report on the Peshawar Fair was sent to the Deputy Commissioner as usual. One Arab stallion was purchased from Bombay for the Bannu District Board and one for Parachinar, Kurram Agency. Two donkey stallions were also selected and purchased from Hissar for the Bannu District". Five buffalo-bulls were purchased for the Bannu District, while 2 Dhanni bulls were purchased from the Dhanni tract for the Dera Ismail Khan District Board. Also 3 more buffalo-bulls for Hazara and 7 for the Peshawar District. The Superintendent attended the meeting of the Board of Agriculture held at Pusa in the month of February. Among other veterinary matters discussed, the subject of cattle-breeding was an important item. PART II.(3) Rules are necessary for regulating the separation and isolation of animals in an infected place or area and prohibiting or regulating the removal of carcases, fodder, litter, utensils, pens, hurdles, dung or other offal from an infected place or area, also for prohibiting the digging up of carcases which have been buried. Thousands of cattle die every year from contagious diseases apart from hundreds of thousands slaughtered for eating purposes. Surely it is time that all possible precautions be taken to save as many cattle as possible. The price of good cattle has gone up very high in the last few years, and a good pair of bullocks for ploughing purposes, which could be had for Rs. 300 a few years ago, cannot be purchased now for less than Rs. 600. Pathological specimens. 6. Information about the number of specimens examined or received in the office during the year cannot be given, as the registers concerned have been burnt in the recent fire at Rawalpindi. SECTION 1-A.(4) larm for personal safety was felt. No such feeling will ever exist regarding Glanders, as horses and stables are an unknown quantity to the vast majority of people in this country.

Stud bulls.(7) good buffaloes or Montgomery cows make the best milkers, and as there is a great demand for good milk and ghi, so everything should be done for the early improvement of these breeds. While on tour in villages the Superintendent very strongly advised all stock-owners to arrange to collect money, so as to get the type of bulls they wanted. The result has been that they are very keen to get bulls of the Nili breed though they are not prepared to pay the price from their own pockets. They want the Sarkar to pay the price of the bull. Montgomery cattle. 29. Three more Montgomery bulls were purchased for the Bannu District and arrangements for the purchase of more bulls of this type for the Dera Ismail Khan and Peshawar districts are being made. Cows of this breed are very good milkers and, as there is a great number of them in the Province, everything should be done to save them from mixing up with other breeds and getting them covered by Montgomery bulls only. This is not impossible, if every District Board arranges for at least one or two bulls at every Hospital in the district and the public in general is informed about it. This may appear an expensive item, but it is essential for the improvement of this very important breed of cattle and to solve the milk-supply question for the Province. Sheep and goat breeding. 30. Two male goats of the Barbari breed were purchased by the Hazara District from Gujrat for breeding pur- poses. Six merino rams were working in the Hazara District at the end of the year against 11 last year. More rams are badly needed for sheep-breeding in the Frontier Province. Merinoes will do very well in the Kaghan Valley, provided a good selection of them is made and they are entrusted to the right type of men in the valley. We shall have to pay the market price if we want pure-bred merino rams and owes, otherwise we shall have to be contented with three-fourth or half-breeds which we can get very cheap in this country and from which we cannot expect very good results with the country-born rams and ewes. SECTION 2.(8) SECTION 3.(9) While Veterinary Assistants attend outbreaks of contagious diseases, Hospital work suffers and the result is a decrease in the number of patients. The Superintendent wishes to express his thanks to District Officers for the help given by them to him and his staff in carrying on the work. J. S. GAREWAL, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North- West Frontier Province and North Punjab. Programme of work of the Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province, for the year 1922-23. (1) To have as many Hospitals built as possible for the treatment of diseased animals. (2) To attend as many outbreaks of contagious diseases as possible. (3) Village to village touring. Lecturing to Zamindars and cattle- owners on cattle and sheep breeding, castration of sires unfit for breeding purposes, impressing the necessity of having as many good bulls as possible of the breeds well suited for the districts concerned, making arrangements for early reporting of the cases of the outbreaks of contagious diseases to the nearest Veterinary Hospital and helping in inoculation when the outbreak is attended. (4) To supervise horse, mule and donkey breeding (5) To investigate diseases as they occur. N.-W. F. P. Govt. Press, Peshawar(i) TABLE I.
