The sanctioned appointment of second Imperial officer to this College is still vacant, although his services are greatly needed. 28. By the demise of Mr. S. N. Mitra, one of the lecturers during the year, the teaching staff of this College has suffered a considerable loss. He was an officer of great ability, endless energy and one who will be difficult to replace. 29. I should like to place on record the share of assistance this College staff has contributed towards the present war. Volunteers were asked for as Veterinary Supervisors to bo in charge of animals on transports sailing from Bombay. Mr. R. V. Pillai, a member of this College staff, having volunteered was accepted, and I am pleased to say from reports since received that his services have been much appreciated 30. Government sanctioned the deputation of a Deputy Superintendent from this College to Madras, Bombay and the Punjab Veterinary Colleges in order that he might enlarge his experience. Deputy Superintendent Mr. 1). K. Sen, was deputed to the Madras College from 1st to 26th November 1915 when another Government order was received to postpone the deputation this year in consideration of the present financial condition. Mr. Sen was therefore recalled. His report has been submitted to Government- 31. Staff.4 RAYMOND RESEARCH LABORATORY. The work of the Laboratory was carried out in a satisfactory manner. 2. Specimens for examination were received from the Civil Veterinary Departments of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, and Assam as well as from the independent practitioners and private gentlemen of Calcutta. Amongst the diseases diagnosed were Anthrax, Hæmorrhagic, Septicæmia, Glanders, Surra, Black-Quartors and Fowl-Cholera. 3. Morbid materials were supplied from the laboratory to the Imperial Bacteriologist, Imperial Serologist and Assistant Bactoriologist to the Govern- ment of Bengal. 4. Samples of bone-meal were bactoriologically examined for detection of Anthrax and other organisms. 5. Experiments wore made with auto-vaccine prepared at the Labora- tory in the treatment of Mammitis, which disease is not infrequent in Bengal. No definite opinion can be formed as to the efficacy of this vaccine until a larger number of experiments have been made. 6. A complete set of lantern slides of various infectious diseases of animals was prepared by the Artist-Photographer and supplied to the Principal, Madras Veterinary College, for demonstration to the students. 7. Since the demise of Mr. S. N. Mitra in November, Mr. D. Dey, the senior lecturer, has rondered, in addition to his own duties, considerable help to the laboratory work, for which he deserves credit.

DURING the year under report the Civil Veterinary Department of this Province has had rather a chequered career, inasmuch as there had been many changes in the office of the Superintendent occasioned by officers having volunteered their services to the Military Department. Mr. P. J. Kerr, I.C.V.D., remained in charge till 9th July 1915 when he took a commission and loft Calcutta to join his appointment in the Indian Army Reserve Officers, while Mr. A. D. MacGrogor who officiated till the 18th February 1916 also joined the Indian Army Reserve Officers. For the remaining period of the year I held charge of the office in addition to my duties as Principal, Bengal Veterinary College. 2. Mr. Korr remained on tour for 27 days and Mr. MacGrogor Ho days and travelled 1,248 miles and 5,030 miles by rail, 19 and 260 miles by road and 416 and 550 miles by river, respectively. 3. I also toured for 4 days and attended the, Agricultural Conference at Dacca. 4. For various reasons the post of a second Superintendent was not sanctioned, however, the post of a Deputy Superintendent has been added to the existing staff. 5. The new Deputy Superintendent Babu Sarat Chandra Paul, who joined the appointment on the 10th duly 1915, remained 105 days on tour and travelled 5,717 miles by rail, 1,768 miles by river and 206 miles by road. He attended two outbreaks of Surra at Khulna and Camilla, and one of Glanders at Barisal. 6. Requests were made by the Military Department for a number of Veterinary Assistants to serve during the period of the war. As a result of this the following Veterinary Assistants volunteered their services and are. now serving under the Military authorities in various stations in India. 1. Babu J. N. Son Gupta. 2. 2 8. Under Government. Order No. 1662, dated the 13th February 1915, Veterinary Assistant Balm S. N. Chaudhuri was deputed to Madras to undergo a course of training for 9 months in the treatment of elephants. He completed his course in March 1916 and joined his new appointment, under the Commissioner of the Rajshahi Division, on the 1st April 1916, for treat- ment of Government elephants in Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling districts. Part II3 20. Anthrax.4 29. There were 58 itinerant Veterinary assistants working in the province and 13 stationary assistants who also toured in the interior when required to do so. 30. Sixty-one thousand three hundred and eighty-six animals were treated against 53,287, and 11,119 villages were visited by them against 10,189 of the previous year. 31. Bankura, Khulna. Dacca, Krishorganj, Jamalpur, Nator, Palma, Bogra and Sirajganj were responsible for the increase in the number of cases noticed during the year under report. 32. The large falling-off noticed against Haripal, Midnapore. Nadia, Siliguri, Barisal, Patuakhali, Noakhali, Dinajpur, Jalpaiguri and Alipur-Duars are reported to be due to the decrease of outbreaks of all sorts, specially foot-and-mouth disease. Table V. Hospitals and Dispensaries. 33. Table V shows the working of hospitals and dispensaries which were 24 in all during the year under report, all of which were duly inspected by the Superintendent and the inspecting staff. The total number of cases treated shows a satisfactory increase being 29,349 against 24,049 of the previous year. 34. The construction of the veterinary dispensary with quarters for two Veterinary assistants (1 itinerary and 1 stationary) at Barisal referred to in preceding year's report has been completed and the dispensary moved to the new buildings. Provision for the employment of a stationary Veterinary assistant for Barisal from October 1916 has been made in the current year's (1916-17) budget of the Board. 35. Provision has also been made in the said Board's budget for the construction of a small Veterinary dispensary with quarters for the Veteri- nary assistants in each of the three outlying subdivisions. The work will be taken up as soon as the required sites, which are being acquired, are made over to the Board. 36. Construction of a new Government dispensary at Dacca, which was sanctioned long ago, has not yet been undertaken. 37. The Cooch Behar Dispensary, which remained closed during the previous year, was this year supplied with an assistant from the Depart- ment. Part III5 Horse and Pony Stallions. 43. As reported in the previous years, there was no horse or pony stallion in the province. Tables X, XI and XII are therefore blank.

S. PressREVENUE DEPARTMENT. AGRICULTURE. CALCUTTA,THE 24TH AUGUST 1916. RESOLUTION2 promptly attended to by the staff of the Bengal Veterinary College. Inocula- tion was performed in 3,181 oases, of which only 5 died. It is reported that prejudice against inoculation still exists among cultivators in some districts. The Governor in Council trusts that the satisfactory results attending the work of inoculation will gradually overcome the objection. 5. During the year under report the Itinerant Veterinary Assistants visited 11,119 villages and treated 61,386 animals compared with 10.189 villages and 53,287 animals in the previous year. This is satisfactory. Thirteen new Veterinary Assistants were appointed during the year bringing the total number of such assistants employed in districts to 82, excluding four Staff Veterinary Assistants and six Reserve Veterinary Assistants. Several applications from District Boards for additional Veterinary Assist- ants had to be refused for want of qualified men. It is satisfactory to notice that the demand for Veterinary Assistants is continuing to increase. 6. There were altogether 83 stud bulls in the Province at the close of the year. Most of them are the property of Jails or of District Boards. Many applications received for bulls during the year from District Boards could not be complied with owing to want of suitable animals. It is hoped that this demand will in time be met by the Provincial Cattle Breeding Farm. It is reported that the Circle Inspectors try to impress upon the public the means of improving the breed of cattle and specially the necessity of proper care and feeding. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, remarks that the work of the Veterinary Assistants was satisfactory. 7. In Calcutta and its neighbourhood all the stables within the area under the Glanders and Farcy Act were frequently inspected during the year, and glanders was detected in 5 stables against 6 in the previous year. Four stables were also found infected with surra against 3 in 1914-15. In the mufassal glanders was confined to two districts, viz., Bakarganj and Dacca, and there were only 9 deaths against 38 in the preced- ing year. The deaths in the Sodepur Pinjrapole also declined, the number being 71 against 167 in the previous year. There were severe outbreaks of surra in the districts of Khulna and Tippera. All possible measures for its suppression were taken by the staff of the Department. 8. No new dispensary was opened during the year. The total number of patients treated at the existing 24 dispensaries shows a considerable increase, viz., 29,349 against 24,049 in 1914-15. Satisfactory progress is shown in almost all the districts of the Province. New buildings were completed for the Veterinary Dispensary at Barisal, and the dispensary was removed to them during the year. The Governor in Council observes with satisfaction that arrangements are being made by the District Board of Bakarganj for the construction of a Veterinary Dispensary with quarters for the Veterinary Assistants in each of the three outlying subdivisions. 9. The number of animals sent to the College Hospital for treatment in connection with cases under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act during the year was 523 out of 4,879 prosecutions instituted under the Act, as against 220 animals out of 8,455 prosecutions in the previous year. The report submitted by the Committee appointed to consider whether any improvement was possible in the law of cruelty to animals and its adminis- tration is under the consideration of Government. 10. During the year under report seven Veterinary Assistants of the Province volunteered lor service with Indian Silladar Cavalry Regiments and the Supply and Transport Corps, and they are now serving under the military authorities in various stations in India. Mr. R. V. Pillai, a member of the Bengal Veterinary College, was also permitted during the year to volunteer for the duty of taking charge of horses which were being supplied for military purposes from Bombay. His conduct was favourably reported on. One Veterinary Assistant was deputed to Madras during the year to undergo a course of training in the treatment of elephants. After completing his course the Veterinary Assistant joined his appointment under the Commissioner of the Rajshahi Division for treatment of Government elephants in the districts of Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling.
3 11. The Governor in Council acknowledges his appreciation of the services of Lieutenant-Colonel Smith, Principal of the Bengal Veterinary College, and of Messrs. P. J. Kerr and A. D. MacGregor who held the post of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department. Bengal, during the year. The reports show a large amount of valuable work done by the Veterinary Department and bear testimony to the success of its operations. By order of the Governor in Council, L. BIRLEY.
