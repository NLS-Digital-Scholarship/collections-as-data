HOME DEPARTMENT. MEDICAL AND SANITARY. AUGUST 1882. No. 3. REPORT ON LUNATIC ASYLUMS FOR 1881. No.590/3544, dated 18th August 1882. FromNo. 1999, dated 23rd June 1882. From( 2 ) ANNUAL REPORT OF THE LAHORE LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1881, BY BRIGADE-SURGEON J. FAIRWEATHER. Population. 1. On 1st January 240 lunatics remained in the Asylum from the previous year, and 93 were admitted in the course of the year, making a total of 333, of whom 39 were discharged cured, 7 were made over to the care of friends (2 improved and 5 not improved), 4 escaped and have not boon recaptured, 8 were discharged an not insane, 35 died, and the year cloned with the same number as it had begun. 2. The number of admissions exceeds the previous years by 28 ; but it may be observed that for the past 3 years the admissions have been much fewer than in former years, probably because of the stricter Government orders as to the kind of cases which are to be sent to Lunatic Asylums. 3. The proportion of cured to daily average strength was 16.27 per cent. as compared with 14.60 * for the previous year. The deaths amounted to 140 per cent. of the daily average strength as compared with 6.8 per rent. for the previous year; but the latter was one of the healthiest years there had been for some time, while the former was very unhealthy, and had the severest epidemic of cholera which has occurred in Lahore since 1856. Criminal lunatics. 4. Of criminal lunatics, 36 remained from previous year, and 12 were admitted during the year, making a total of 48, of whom 8 recovered so far as to be able to be sent back to their districts to stand their trials, 3 were transferred to Jail on recovery, 2 were transferred to the non-criminal class on completion of their terms of imprisonment, 2 were made over to the care of friends under Government orders (one of these being cured, the other still insane), I escaped and I died, leaving 31 at the close of the year. 5. The number of criminal lunation has varied very little in this Asylum for the past 10 years. They are kept for security in a separate part of the Asylum common to them and the other dangerous lunatics, although some who can be trusted are allowed to mix with the other lunatics in different parts of the Asylum. They have given no trouble during the year, and, as an incentive to good conduct, the letters have been removed from all but a few who cannot be trusted. It must be said, however, that they seem to prefer the rigour of Jail discipline to the amenities and indulgences of the Lunatic Asylum, for an soon as they recover their senses they usually petition to be sent back to prison. Religion, sex and residence. 6. Of the 93 new admissions, 53 were Hindus, 36 were Mussalmans, and 4 belonged to other castes. Only 5 of the new admissions were women, 2 being Hindus and 3 Mussalmanis. 7. The greater part of them were of course residents of the Punjab, but several belonged to the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, some to the Native States of Patiala, Jind and Jey- pur, a few came from beyond British territory, and in 13 the residence could not bo ascertained Previous occupation. 8. In the table showing the previous occupations of those admitted during the year, it will be found that sepoys form the most numerous class. This in probably due in some degree to the excitement of the Kabul war, and in several instances it wan found out that they had been on service there. Types of insanity. 9. The different forms or types of insanity admitted were 27 of acute and 46 of chronic mania, 6 or melancholia, and 1 of idiocy. Thirteen of the new admissions presented no symptom of insanity from the time of their admission till their discharge. Of these no fewer than 5 were sepoys sent from different regiments, who would appear to have been laboring under some merely temporary excitement, and who, therefore, had they been kept only a little longer under observation, need not have been subjected to the punishment and stigma of continement in a Lunatic Asylum. 10. In the preparation of table No. 6, which shows the types of insanity, it appears to have been the custom in thin Asylum, as well as in some others, to include under the head of " Recovered " all who were discharged an " not insane, " and under the head of " Improved " all who were " transferred to friends " or who escaped, the reason assigned being that there was * Memo. ( 3 ) no other head in this table under which they could be included. But as some of the other returns are vitiated by this practice, I have ventured, with the concurrence of the Surgeon- General, Punjab, to add another heading to this table, viz.," Discharged otherwise and escaped," which will include all cases that do not come under the heads of " Recovered," " Improved, " or "Died." Causes of insanity. 11. Table 7, which shows the alleged causes of insanity among the now admissions, is defective in the same way as the proceding, and requires the addition of the same heading to make it complete But as far as trustworthy information goes, this table might as well be left out, for it is evident that in almost every case the descriptive rolls of lunatics, from which information regarding causes of insanity is chiefly derived, are left to be filled up by some ignorant subordinate, while the officers who append their signatures to thorn, do not oven take the trouble to cast their eye over them before doing so. This will be apparent from one or two examples of the answers given in these papers. Under " causes of insanity " occur such answers as " dryness and heat," "heat and drugs," "ungratified sexual desire," "took mixture of opium, bhang, rum, poppy-heads and milk the day of his attack," " natural cause. " To the question " Is the luna- tic subject to any form of delusion," the following answers occur : " Wishes to lead a free life;" "no particular delusion but of troubling persons and others." Sickness and mortality. 12. The total admissions into hospital were 521 against 478 for the previous year, and the daily average number of sick was 19.63 against 17.82. These figures do not indicate any very great difference in the health of the Asylum between the two years ; but unfortunately the mortality, owing mainly to cholera, was more than double what it was in 1880. 1880 however had by far the lowest rate of mortality of any year as far back as the records of the Asylum go, and it is satisfactory to find that although 1881 was a very unhealthy year, and was characterised by the severest epidemic of cholera which has visited Lahore since 1856, still the mortality among the lunatics was 4 per cent. less than the average mortality for the previous decade. 13. The diseases from which deaths occurred were :( 4 ) Cost per head. 18. The annual cost per head of the lunatics for the two years 1880 and 1881 is here shown for comparison :( 5 ) Diet. 26. On comparing the dietary of this Asylum with that of other establishments of the same kind in other parts of the country as well as with the dietary of Punjab jails, I discovered that the allowance of ghi and fatty matter was much smaller than in these. On representing this through the Surgeon-General, Punjab, the allowance of ghi was raised from 1/5 chittak to 1/2 chittak per head during the colder months of November, December, January and February. This I think ought to have a beneficial effect on the health of the lunatics in the cold weather. Tree-planting. 27. Tree-planting has been carried on pretty extensively both inside and outside the Asylum, several hundreds of young sheshams and pipal and carob trees having been put down; and in the garden some good vines have been planted. Establishment. 28. On 3rd February Doctor Scriven, who had been Superintendent of the Asylum for ten years, left for England, and since then the under- signed has been in charge. Considering that the year was so unhealthy, that cholera lurked in the Asylum for two months, and that part of the lunatics had to be moved into camp(6) No. 1.

HOME DEPARTMENT. MEDICAL AND SANITARY. MAY 1883. No. 3. REVIEW OF THE REPORTS OF THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS AT LAHORE AND DELHI FOR 1882. No. 367/ 2577, dated Lahore, 25th May 1883. From-W. M. YOUNG, Esquire, Secretary to Government, Punjab, To-The Surgeon-General, Punjab. I AM desired to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1283, dated 28th April last, submitting the Reports of the Lunatic Asylums at Lahore and Delhi for the year 1882, and in reply to make the following remarks. 2. The Lieutenant-Governor notices with satisfaction the increase in the proportion of inmates of the Lahore Asylum employed in manufactures during the year, and is also glad to learn that the question of supplying this Asylum with pure water from the Municipal waterworks is receiving attention. The Superintendent's representation of the want of a work-shed in the criminal ward should not be lost sight of. 3. The want of accommodation for European lunatics at Lahore has recently been brought to the notice of the Lieutenant-Governor on a represen- tation made by the Commissioner of the Jullundur Division and by the Inspector-General of Prisons. The construction of European wards was sanctioned in September 1882, and a reference will be made to the Secretary to Government, Public Works Department, on the subject. 4. The attention of the Commissioners of Lahore and Delhi will be invited to the facts regarding the non-capture of escaped lunatics referred to in paragraph 6 of your letter. 5. The increased cost per head in the Delhi Asylum during the year referred to in paragraph 10 of your letter is serious, and in view of the circumstances, unaccountable ; and I am to request that the matter may receive careful consideration, and a full report be submitted regarding the circumstances which occasioned this increase. 6. His Honor notices with satisfaction the success which attended the measures adopted by Dr. Ross in the Delhi Asylum to occupy and amuse the inmates. Nos. 368.9/2578.9, dated Lahore, 25th May 1883. From-W. M. YOUNG, Esquire, Secretary to Govornment, Punjab, To No. 1283, dated 28th April 1883. From - Surgeon-General S. C. TOWNSEND, C. B., Surgeon-General, Punjab, To( 2 ) Lahore Asylum the decrease in cost was chiefly in the item of diet, but in the Delhi, the cost of diet per head rose Rs. 35-13-0 in 1881 to Rs. 39-9-0 in 1882, an increase of nearly Rs. 4 per head. Dr. Ross states that the increase was due to the extra diet ordered, but this explanation is scarcely satisfactory, for any increase on this account should have been more than compensated by the lower price of food that prevailed throughout the year. 11. In the Lahore Asylum 161, or 61 per cent. of the average population, were employed in labour or manufactures during the year ; in the Delhi Asy- lum 55, or 76 per cent., were so employed. In the Lahore Asylum the net profits on the labour amounted to Rs. 1,234, in Delhi to Rs. 353, equal to Rs. 7-10-0 and Rs. 6-6-0 per head respectively, compared with the previous year. The profits by employment of the lunatics was considerably higher in the Lahore Asylum, somewhat less in the Delhi Asylum. 12. The Superintendent of the Lahore Asylum represents the desira- bility of having the Asylum provided with pure water from the Municipal service, and also of providing accommodation for the temporary confinement of European insanes. Both measures are greatly needed, and proposals for carrying them into effect are under consideration. 13. In both reports several cases of interest are described, and there is satisfactory evidence that the lunatics are well cared for and kindly treated. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE LAHORE LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1882. Population( 3 ) Causes of insanity( 4 ) The total expenditure, Rs. 29,329-2-10, is greater than that for 1881 by about Rs. 1,300. This is due partly to the fact that the daily average population in 1882 was 22 in excess of that of 1881, but chiefly to the larger expenditure incurred by the Public Works Department. The amount spent, mostly on repairs, was Rs. 3,329 in 1882, while in 1881 it was Rs. 1,946. There has been a decrease in the average cost per head in 1882 compared with the previous year under all headings of expenditure, with the exception of clothing and bedding, the charge for which has risen from Rs. 5-9-10 in 1881 to Rs. 7-6-2 in 1882. The total cost per head has fallen from Rs. 105-0-9 to Rs. 94-11-3. This satisfactory result is chiefly due to the fall in cost of provisions, in consequence of which the diet per head during the year cost Rs. 36-14-0, while in 1881 it cost Rs. 42-15-10. Establishment. 10. A list of establishment is given in State- ment X. I think it requires revision in some respects. We ought to have more than one respect- able female warder. There are three " female coolies," each in receipt of Rs. 5 a month, but they are utterly untrustworthy, and do not care whether they give satisfaction or not. The consequence is that they give constant trouble. Their pay ought to be raised to not less than Rs. 8 a month. The female sweeper's pay, Rs. 4 a month, is also inadequate. Considering the rates at which the subordinate establishment is paid, I think that they have done watch and ward wonderfully well. The Deputy Superintendent, Assistant Surgeon Abdul Hamid, has been long in the appointment, and has during the past year maintained the character he previously had acquir- ed for kind, careful and judicious management. I have found the matron, Mrs. Sinnott, careful, steady and trustworthy. The Clerk, Hospital Assistant, and Head Warder have also given satisfaction in the discharge of their duties during the year. 11. In conclusion, I would point out that the want of accommodation for European lunatics at Lahore has been felt on more than one occasion during the past year. There is, I believe, no suitable accommodation in the Province for this class of lunatics, and it is very necessary that here or elsewhere there should be a ward in which they could be detained and put under proper treatment, till such time as final arrangements for their disposal could be made. A proposal has been made that two small wards, one for male and one for female European lunatics, be built in connection with the Lahore Asylum, and I trust it will be carried out with as little delay as possible.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DELHI LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1882. Population. I. Seventy-five lunatics remained at the close of last year, and forty were admitted during 1882, making a total population of 115 ; of these, 19 were discharged cured, 15 given over to friends, 11, having partially recovered, 6 were discharged otherwise, 5 proving not insane, and 1 escaping. The number transferred to friends exceeds any year since 1877, the visitors being anxious not to retain harmless lunatics whose relations were in a position to look after them, and were willing to do so. The number cured, 19 is satisfactory, including as it does several extremely bad cases. Sickness and mortality. II. The admissions into hospital were from ague, ophthalmia, pneumonia, dysentery, abscess and debility from enlarged spleen, being in all 89. The daily average of sick was 4.19, and there were 10 deaths, 4 from pneumonia, 1 from epilepsy, 1 from laryngitis, 1 from bronchitis, 1 from dysentery, and two from debility. The fatal cases of pneumonia were old insanes, weakly and disposed to get rid of their clothing. The year was healthy, and consequently there was but little sickness. It is curious that females suffer so much less from confinement or imprisonment than males. Out of a strength of 22 females, there were only 10 cases of sickness; none died, nor were any of the admissions from severe diseases, although the women are just as prone to go naked as the men and eat filth. I have observed that female prisoners are always far healthier than the males in prison, probably the sedentary life women lead has something to say to it. Dry-earth system. III. The dry-earth system is still strictly adhered to a large quantity of screened earth being always in stock ; for spreading on the floors and bunks. Criminal lunatics. IV. Three criminals were admitted ; 1 was discharged and 2 died. Types of insanity. V. Of admissions, 12 were acute and 5 from chronic mania, 7 from melancholia, 3 from acute and 5 from chronic dementia, 3 from monomania. There were some very extraordinary lunatics in the asylum during the year; many of them so very noisy and demonstrative that I gave out a set of bazr musical instruments in the hope of rendering their uproar more melodious. This plan succeeded very well, and I think materially aided the recovery of several of those cured, or given over to friends. The most remarkable inmates were( 2 ) A very remarkable man was sent from Rohtak, discharged ultimately among the " no insanes," He was a Sirbanghi, and of most respectable and venerable presence, and was put in jail for roasting a piece of a child and eating it. His excuse for this cannibalism was, that being a Sirbanghi, a man who depended on whatever Providence or chance might cast in his way as food, he had an equal right with the jackal which he found eating the body : his repast was, however, disturbed by the bereaved parent, who handed him over to the police. The Sirbanghi was then sent to the asylum, but not proving insane was sent back to Rohtak. This Sirbanghi faqr was one of the last of a class of mendicants who existed numerously in the Sikh times in the Punjab. He stated that he had eaten dead bodies twice before, and that no flesh tasted better : he ate snakes raw or roasted, a large cobra or " krait" producing a pleasant degree of " nasha."

( 4 ) 16. The Superintendent of the Lahore Asylum again brings to notice the desirability of having a good water-supply obtained from the municipal water- works, the entire cost of which is estimated at Rs. 11,600. 17. A ward for European lunatics and a workshed for the criminal ward have been sanctioned, but the works have been held in abeyance owing to paucity of funds. The urgent need for additional solitary cells is also noticed by Dr. Gray, whose observations on this point I fully endorse. 18. This officer gives some very interesting details regarding the class of idiots commonly known in this Province as " Shah Dowla's mice." As far as I have been able to gather from enquiries made at Gujrat and elsewhere, the statement that their heads have been forcibly moulded or compressed is quite devoid of foundation. Such cases are not peculiar to the Punjab, and I recollect myself having seen idiots belonging to the Lower Provinces with heads of precisely similar formation. 19. The subordinate establishment at Lahore is well reported on, but at Delhi the Superintendent is much dissatisfied with Mr. Cousins, the Deputy Superintendent. This officer had recently to stand his trial before the civil authorities for criminal misappropriation. It, however, resulted in his acquittal, and he has therefore been reinstated. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE LAHORE LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR 1883, BY R. GRAY, SURGEON-MAJOR, M.D., SUPERINTENDENT. Population. ON the 1st January 1883 the number of lunatics in the asylum was 271; during the year 80 were admitted, making a total of 351. There were discharged cured 31 ; improved 6 ; made over to their friends (not improved) 7 ; 1 escaped and has not been recaptured ; and 23 died ; and at the close of the year there remained 283. The daily average strength was 284; in 1882 it was 262. As compared with the previous year, there were 18 fewer admissions ; while 9 more were discharged cured. There was exactly the same number of deaths (23). During the whole of the year the number in the asylum was but little under the maximum (290) which it can accommodate without overcrowding. Criminal Lunatics, statement II. 2. At the commencement of the year there were 32 criminal lunatics ; 7 were admitted, 5 were discharged and transferred to the non-criminal class, and 1 died, leaving 33 on the 31st December. Statements III, IV and V. 3. Call for no remark. Types of Insanity. Statement VI. 4. As usual, the admissions have chiefly consisted of cases of mania, acute and chronic, and it is in those types of insanity, especially the former, that most cures are effected. In cases of chronic insanity of long standing there is but little hope of recovery, and when such lunatics, after being kept under observation for a sufficient length of time evince no tendency to injure themselves or others, they are made over to their friends under Section 10 of Act XXXVI, of 1858, provided they will receive them, and the Deputy Commissioner considers that they are fit persons to have charge of them. The same course is pursued with regard to imbeciles, idiots and some cases of chronic lementia. There are 24 lunatics whom I have endeavoured to discharge from the asylum in this way; but in most cases I have failed, because no friends or relatives can be found, or if found, they are not willing to undertake the charge of them. It will be seen that there has been one admission during the year under the head of "idiotcy." This is a female idiot who belongs to a class of idiots whose head-quarters are at a shrine in the Gujrt district, and who are known all over the Province as " Shah Doul's mice." As attention has lately been directed to this subject by Government with the view of collecting information regarding this class of idiots, it will perhaps not be considered uninteresting or out of place if I here give a short account of the "chui" who has been lately admitted into the Lunatic Asylum.
( 5 ) She is a girl probably of about sixteen years of age. She is of small development( 6 ) nearer than the Yekki Gate, and that the total expenditure would not be less than Rs. 11,600. It was stated that the long distance of the point from which the supply was to be taken was necessitated by the fact that the railway pipe, the only large pipe in the neighbour- hood, was too small even for the Company's requirements. For the present, therefore, I fear we must give up all hope of carrying out this much- needed improvement. I may state that the water of the wells inside the Asylum is so bad as to be unfit for drinking purposes, and that drinking water has to be brought from outside wells by bhisties. Of course as the water of the Asylum wells is used for irrigating the grass plots and garden, it is quite impossible to prevent the lunatics from sometimes using it for drinking purposes. Ward for European lunatics : workshet in criminal ward. 8. The ward for European lunatics has been sanctioned ; so, I believe, has a workshed in the criminal ward ; but from the want of funds neither can be commenced during the current year. The former is very urgently needed, and I trust nothing will occur to prevent its being provided at the very commencement of next financial year. Inadequate numbers of cells. 9. On several occasions during the year it has been found that the number of cells has been inadequate. Altogether there are only ten cells in the Asylum, and at least six more are required. The necessity for an increased number of cells arises from the fact that we now impose fetters, hand-cuffs, strait jackets, &c, much less frequently than was done sometime ago ; indeed, it is only in most exceptional cases that physical restraint of that description is resorted to. It is, therefore, absolutely necessary that lunatics in a state of violent excitement should be each confined in a separate cell. Cash acoount, statement IX. 10. From statement IX it will be seen that the following has been the expenditure during the year :( 7 ) There has thus been a decrease of 14 annas a head in 1883 compared with 1882, due partly to the lower rates of provisions, but chiefly to the fact that the average number of inmates was greater in the latter year. The charge for clothing and bedding was nearly Rs. 2 in excess of that for 1882, in consequence of its being found necessary to provide a considerable number of blankets to bring the stock up to the requirement of the Asylum. Clothing and bedding will always be an expensive item in the Asylum, as a considerable quantity is destroyed by some of the lunatics, and owing to the filthy habits of others, it is necessary to have a pretty large supply of clean articles in store. Statement XI, manufactures. 11. During the year the average number employed on some sort of labour was 174.5. I regret that there is not greater variety of work for the lunatics. Weaving cloth and blankets, making baskets, spinning thread, grinding wheat or surkhi, and working in the garden, are almost the only means we have of furnishing them with employment. It will be a great boon to have some sort of workshed in the criminal ward, which contains most of the able-bodied lunatics. At present we have only a bare compound. I have been endeavouring to grow a few trees in it, but it is a most difficult thing to circumvent the destructive tendencies of some of the inmates, who generally contrive to mutilate or uproot the trees soon after they are planted. The total profits during the year were Rs. 1,244-7-6; in the previous year they were Rs. 1,234-7-0. Establishment. 12. During the year I have had to dismiss two male warders for very grave misconduct, and there have been frequent complaints against the female coolies. The female warder is now so old and infirm as to be quite unfit for further duty. The Deputy Superintendent, Abdul Hamd; the Matron, Mrs. Sinnott; the Clerk Jawande Ll ; and the Head Warder, Mirza Hasan Ali deserve to be favourably mentioned for the careful manner in which they have performed their duties during the year.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE PUNJAB FOR THE YEAR 1884. Published by Authority [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Lahore: THE "CIVIL AND MILITARY GAZETTE" PRESS, Contractors to the Punjab Government. 1885.
No. 728 S. FROM C. L. TUPPER, ESQUIRE, Offg. Secretary to Government, Punjab and its Dependencies, To J. FAIRWEATHER, ESQUIRE, Offg. Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab. Dated Simla, 17th July 1885. Home. Medical and Sanitary, SIR, I AM directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1849, dated the 18th of June 1885, submitting the Reports on the Lunatic Asylums at Lahore and Delhi for the year 1884. Your remarks reviewing the Reports are contained in your separate letter No. 1455, dated the 6th of May 1885. 2. The only points in which the Lieutenant-Governor desires to make any comment relate toNo. 1455, dated LAHORE, 6th May 1885. From2 could not, look after the manufactures, and so blankets and summer clothing had to be bought instead of being made up by the lunatics themselves, as usual. The high expenditure on contingencies is only partially explained by the failure of the crops sown for feed of bullocks, so that fodder had also to be bought. 8. The number of paying patients in the Lahore Asylum during the year was 13, of whom 11 were sepoys and 2 were private patients. The amount received from these was Rs. 405. In Delhi the number was 7, all of whom appear to have been private patients, and the amount realized from them was Rs. 557. 9. The profits on account of manufactures at the Lahore Asylum amounted to Rs. 1,380-13-6, or an increase of Rs. 136-6-0 over last year's profits. At Delhi they amounted to Rs. 876-5-7, or Rs. 211-7-9 more than last year. These figures are very satisfactory, especially for Delhi, where the number of lunatics is so much smaller than in Lahore. 10. A ward for European lunatics, which was much wanted in the Lahore Asylum, was begun in November last, and will soon be ready for use. Six additional solitary cells for dangerous lunatics, which were much needed, have also been begun in this asylum. In Delhi no change has occurred. 11. It was feared that owing to the great expense of bringing a main from the Municipal Water-Works for the use of the Lahore Asylum, the scheme would have to be abandoned; but recently (1st May), and since the Annual Report was written, Dr. Center has been able, in communication with the Railway authorities, to arrange for a pipe from their main, which will give a sufficient supply for the wants of the asylum. The estimated cost is only Rs. 885, and the Chief Engineer of the Railway has kindly offered to see the work carried out. The proposal is now before Government for sanction. 12. At Delhi, Dr. Ross has also proposed a scheme for supplying a purer water to the lunatics, as the well they have hitherto used has become brackish. It will be necessary for him, however, first to obtain an analysis of the water from the well from which he proposes to obtain his supply, and then submit a plan and estimate for the work.
3 No. 55, dated LAHORE, 20th March 1885. From4 One man, who had erroneously been forwarded as an idiot last year, was found to be suffering from acute mania, and on recovery was discharged. Alleged causes of insanity. 6. The admissions have been chiefly from physical causes. Many appear to be sent to the asylum who are suffering from the effects of Indian hemp in its various forms5 The number of solitary cells in the dangerous ward was formerly insufficient. Six new ones have been begun. This will prevent the necessity of using any other form of physical restraint. A work-shed in the criminal ward has been sanctioned, but has not been begun to be built yet, as there were no funds available during the year. Water-supply. 12. With reference to the Lieutenant-Governor's remarks regarding a new water-supply, enquiries were made as to the possibility of getting the municipal water. It was replied that it could not be given from the Railway main, which was scarcely large enough for the Railway. The Municipality had no intention of laying down a larger main, even if it was asked for, as there were no funds. The cost of a separate main from the Yakki gate would be Rs. 11,600. As a temporary measure, arrange- ments will be made to get drinking and cooking water brought from the municipal hydrant in a water cart, and distributed and stored in a cleanly manner. Water for washing and cleaning purposes will be supplied, as before, from the well in the asylum. Establishment. 13. Dr. Gray held the office of Superintendent from the beginning of the year till the 25th July, when I took over charge. The Matron, Mrs. A. E. Sinnott, died on the 2nd October of pneumonia, and Mrs. M. Mahon was appointed in her place on the 2nd November. The Deputy Superintendent, Assistant Surgeon Abdul Hamid, and the Clerk Javand Ll, have done their work satisfactorily. First class warder Shamshere Khn is now old and sickly, and has been off work from sickness for prolonged periods. He will be recommended for gratuity. A younger man who is physically fit for the duties is required in his place.

I have made a proposal to bring sweet water from a boli near the river about 300 yards from the jail, as the water of the well which supplies the jail and asylum has become bad and excessively saline. The want of good water for drinking and garden purposes is particu- larly felt in the summer months, it being hard to grow vegetables or even jet seed to germinate early. The project need not cost more than Rs. 800, as the pipes can be made in the jail for nothing, and the water raised by a treadmill with Persian wheels. The boli with the intervening ground is the property of Government.

No. 345. FROM W. M. YOUNG, ESQUIRE, Secretary to Government, Punjab and its Dependencies, To A. M. DALLAS, ESQUIRE, C.I.E., Inspector- General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab. Dated Lahore, 7th July 1887. Home. Medical & Sanitary SIR, I AM directed by the Lieutenant-Governor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1674, dated the 14th of May 1887, submitting the report on the Lahore and Delhi Lunatic Asylums for the year 1886, 2. The report is due in this office on the 15th of April, but it was not received until the 14th of May ; the chief causes of delay being (1) the non- despatch of the Delhi Asylum Report by the Superintendent in charge until the 21st of March, and (2) the direct submission of the report to this office by the Commissioner of the Delhi Division instead of to you. I am directed to request that you will be so good as to instruct the Asylum authorities to submit the report more promptly in future, fixing a date if you consider this advisable, and that you will explain to the Commissioner that the report should be sent direct to your office. 3. The Lieutenant-Governor regrets to observe several errors in the two local reports. The figures 7.43 and 3.68 in the last two lines in paragraph 1, page 3, of the Lahore Asylum Report should be altered to 7.44 and 3.67 to accord with column 11 B of Annual Statement No. 1, page 5. The following correc- tions should also be made in that annual statement:( 2 ) I am to request that, greater care may be exercised in the preparation of the returns in future It seems probable that most of the errors pointed out are typographical, but they should have been detected before the reports left your office. 4. It is noticed that a lunatic managed to effect his escape from the Delhi Asylum under circumstances which seem to denote carelessness on the part of some of the establishment, and was not subsequently heard of. With reference to this, I am to ask whether any enquiry was held, and, if so, with what result. 5. The health of the inmates of both Asylums is reported to have been indifferent during the year 1886. In the Lahore Asylum there were a considerable number of sufferers from injuries; ophthalmia was prevalent, and ulcers very frequent. The Lieutenant-Governor desires to know whether any causes can be assigned for the prevalence of these complaints. 6. The question of improving the water-supply of the Lahore Asylum, which is said to be scanty during the hot weather, is under separate consider- ation. Cost per head. Rs. A. P. 1885 = ed 95 12 4 1886 = ed 92 1 8 Decrease ... 3 10 8 7. The Lieutenant Governor observes with satisfaction that the average cost per head of each lunatic in the Delhi Asylum has at last been reduced to a reasonable figure. This cost has fallen from Rs. 110-6-10 in 1884 to Rs. 95-12-4-in 1885, and to Rs. 92-1-8 in 1886, and this, it is stated, without any discomfort to the patients. In paragraph 8 of your letter under reply you observe that the cost of each lunatic was Rs. 3-8-7 less than in 1885. I am, however, to point out that if the corrected figures as given in paragraph 3 of my letter No, 419, dated the 12th of June 1885, are worked on, it will be found that the decreased cost per head on the expenditure of the year 1885 is Rs. 3-10-8, as noted on the margin. The cost per head at Lahore shows an increase of Rs. 2-3-4 on that for the year 1885. This increase is said to be chiefly due to the enhanced price of pro- visions. This explanation does not seem to be adequate with reference to the Delhi returns. 8. The necessity of a workshed in the dangerous ward for criminal lunatics at Lahore will be again brought to the notice of the Public Works Department, and that Department will also be asked to provide, if possible, a convalescent ward in the Delhi Asylum. 9. It would appear that the only paying patient in the Delhi Asylum was a sepoy of the 45th Sikh Infantry, on whose account a sum of Rs. 4-12-0 was received. The paucity of paying patients in this Asylum, is remarkable, and the Lieutenant-Governor will be glad to receive a report as to what steps are taken to recover the cost of maintenance from the friends of the lunatics, or from the lunatics themselves, if cured. 10. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to learn that the conduct of the subordinate establishments in both Asylums was good. The careful manage- ment of Mr. Bernard, Overseer of the Delhi Asylum, who is said to have been instrumental in reducing the cost of maintenance of the lunatics, is deserving of special commendation. 11. The remarks by the Finance Committee in respect to the two Asylums are under consideration, and will form the subject of a special report to the Government of India. I have, &c., W. M. YOUNG, Secretary to Government, Punjab, Punjab Government Press, Lahore.No. 1276. FROM A. M. DALLAS, ESQ., C.I.E., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab. TO W. M. YOUNG, ESQ., Secretary to the Government, Punjab. Dated LAHORE, 20th April 1887. SIR, I have the honor to forward the reports on the Lunatic Asylums at Lahore and Delhi for the year 1886. The report of the Delhi Asylum was received very late, the Superintendent having submitted it to the Deputy Com- missioner on the 21st March. Much delay was caused by the submission of the report to Government, instead of direct to me. I received it on the 7th April, a week after the manuscript should have beer sent to press. 2. On the 1st January 1886, there were 285 lunatics in the Lahore Asylum, and during the year 79 were admitted, making a total of 364 inmates, the largest number since 1878. Of this number, 298 were males and 66 females. There were 96 inmates in the Delhi Asylum on the 1st of January 1886, and 45 were admitted during the year, making a total population of 141 lunatics; the same as last year. Of this number, 111 were males and 30 females. 3. The number of lunatics who were under treatment in both Asylums was, thus, 505; 409 males and 96 females, compared with 495 in 1885. 4. At Lahore, 43 were discharged cured and 15 improved; and at Delhi, 15 were discharged cured and 11 improved. One lunatic escaped from the Delhi Asylum, and nothing has since been heard of him. 5. Eleven criminal lunatics were admitted into the Lahore Asylum, and five into Delhi. 6. The health of the asylums was not good. At Lahore there were 329 admissions into hospital (including those remaining from last year) against 279 the year before; the number of deaths, however, 21, was less by 10. The admissions into hospital at Delhi were largely in excess of last year, being 118 and 79 respectively, (including those remaining from last year). The number of deaths, 11, was the same as last year. One-third of the inmates admitted into the Delhi Asylum during the year were in bad health, many being very bad. 7. The expenditure on the institutions (again omitting that on account of paying patients) was for this and the preceding year:2 8. The cost per head of each lunatic at Lahore was Rs. 95-15-10, or Rs. 2-3-4 in excess of the cost for 1885. The increase is said to be due chiefly to the enhanced price of provisions. The cost per head at Delhi continues to fall; and this year, for the first time, it is below the cost per head at Lahore. During the year the cost was Rs. 92-1-8 for each lunatic, or Rs. 3-8-7 below last year's rate. This is very satisfactory ; and the Superintendent again gives the credit for this economical management to Mr. Bernard, the Deputy Superin- tendent. It will be observed, too, that Dr. Bate reports that there was "an ample supply of clothing, diet has been sufficient, and extra food has been given whenever necessary." 9. The net profits from manufactures at the Asylums for 1885 and the year under review were : 3 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE LAHORE LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1886. Population. On the 1st January, there were 285 lunatics remaining in the asylum from the pre- vious year, and 79 were admitted in the course of the year, making a total of 364. Of these 43 were discharged cured and 15 improved. Of the latter 10 were taken to their native places by the Asylum warders, and 5 were handed over to their friends on security here. Three lunatics who had not improved, but were not found dangerous to themselves or others, were made over to the care of their friends on security. There were 21 deaths during the year, and there remained a total of 282 inmates on the 31st of December. The daily average strength was 282.30, being 3.41 more than last year. The proportion of cured to daily average strength was 15.23 per cent., being 5.55 per cent. greater than in the preceding year. The deaths were 7.43 per cent. of the daily average strength, being 3.68 loss than the previous year. Criminal lunatics. 2. Of criminal lunatics, 41 remained from the previous year, and 11 were admitted during the year, making a total of 52, of whom 6 recovered so far as to allow of their being sent back to their districts to stand their trial; 4 were transferred to jail on recovery, 3 were transferred to the non-criminal class on completion of their terms of imprisonment, 1 was made over to the care of friends on security under Government orders, 1 was sent to Bareilly Lunatic Asylum by the order of Punjab Government at the request of the father, and 1 died4 Harmless lunatics. 12. Ten harmless lunatics have been discharged from the Asylum, who were con- sidered by the visitors of the Asylum to be able to earn their own living in some way. Manufactures. 13. The net profit from manufactures has been Rs. 1,124-3-6, which is somewhat greater than that realised in the preceding year Rs. 1,092-12-6. Building. 14. A cook house has been added to the ward for European lunatics during the year under report. I would again urge upon Government the necessity for erecting a workshed in the dangerous ward for criminal lunatics, who often remain sane when their period of insanity is over or have lucid intervals. The plan of it has been sanctioned long ago, but it has not yet been begun to be built. Water-supply. 15. The Municipal water-supply has been in use for drinking water and cooking purposes. During the hot weather the supply was frequently scanty as the Asylum being at the end of the Railway system, receives water only after the station and Railway barracks have been supplied. A water metre measures the amount supplied, and the cost during the year was Rs. 100-1-2. Cooking. 16. New arrangements have been made for cooking. Formerly Muhammadan cooks were employed, which caused inconvenience, as some of the Hind patients objected to the food so prepared. After some difficulty good Hind cooks were found, and the result has been satisfactory so far. Establishment. 17. There has been no change in the establishment during the year. The Deputy Superintendent, Assistant Surgeon Abdul Hamid, and the Hospital Assistant Usman Ghani have done their work satisfactorily. The clerk Javaud Lll who has been connected with the Asylum for 13 years is a most useful man, acquainted with every detail of the Asylum, and is careful and punctual in his work. The Matron, Mrs. Mahon, has done her work with great tact and kindness. W. CENTER, Superintendent, Lunatic Asylum.

REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS AT LAHORE AND DELHI FOR THE YEAR 1887. Published by Authority. (PriceNo. 34S. FROM C. L. TUPPER, ESQUIRE, Offg. Secretary to Government, Punjab and its Dependencies, TO A. M. DALLAS, ESQUIRE, Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab. Dated Simla, 2nd June 1888. Home. Medical and Sanitary. SIR, I AM directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1082, dated the 6th of April 1888, submitting with your remarks the reports of the Lunatic Asylums at Lahore and Delhi for the year 1887. 2. There is a defect in Statement No. 1 of the Report of the Delhi Asylum where the foot-note to show the capacity of the Asylum and the maximum number of lunatics confined in it on any one night has been omitted. The foot-note has been prescribed as a part of the Report by the Government of India, and I am to request that it may be invariably given in future. 3. The Lieutenant-Governor observes that the cost of each lunatic in the Lahore Asylum reached the very large sum of Rs. 110-14-3. It is, however, explained that this was due to the increased cost of provisions, to the necessity for supplying extra food to the patients during a period of sickness, and to the admission of one European, one Eurasian and one Parsi Lunatic. It appears from paragraph 13 of Surgeon-Major Massy's Report that the European paid all expenses attending his keep. The Lieutenant- Governor notices with satisfaction that at the Delhi institution, where the cost of maintenance in the past has been high and attracted comment, the charge per head has fallen to Rs. 90-9-7. In this connection it may be observed that the cost of dieting the lunatics in the Lahore and Delhi Asylums formed the subject of inquiry at the instance of the Finance Committee, with the result that you have submitted standard scales of diet which, it is hoped, will, under normal circumstances, keep the expenditure under this head within reasonable limits. 4. Another point which the Finance Committee noticed was the desir- ability of a careful examination of contingent charges. It has therefore. been arranged that the Superintendents of the two Asylums shall submit their monthly contingent bills to you for check and countersignature, and that the bills shall be passed only on your authority. This measure ought to result in economy if the check is stringently and systematically applied.
( 2 ) 5. The recoveries from purely private sources, i.e., from the lunatics, or their friends, on account of the cost of maintenance during the year under review show an increase to the following extent: ( 3 ) 11. The Lieutenant-Governor regrets to hear that the conduct of the subordinate establishments at the two Asylums was not satisfactory. At Lahore all the subordinate establishment, with the exception of the Head Warder, appear to have been neglectful of their duty. At Delhi the Deputy Superintendent and Matron are said to have been apathetic in regard to the comfort of the lunatics. They should be warned that serious notice will be taken of any similar complaint that may be made against either of them hereafter. I have, &c., C. L. TUPPER, Offg. Secretary to Government Punjab. Punjab Government Press, Lahore,No. 1082. FROM A. M. DALLAS, ESQUIRE, C.I.E., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab. TO C. L. TUPPER, ESQUIRE, Officiating Secretary to Government, Punjab. Dated LAHORE, 6 th April 1888. SIR, I have the honor to forward the reports of the two Lunatic Asylums at Lahore and Delhi for the year 1887, and to offer the following remarks in connection therewith. 2. On the 1st January 1887 there were 282 lunatics in the Lahore Asy- lum, of whom 226 were males and 56 females, At Delhi there were 95, of whom 72 were males and 23 females. During the year 58 fresh admissions took place in the Lahore Asylum, 48 of whom were males and 10 females; and in the Delhi Asylum there were 48, namely 37 males and 11 females. Compared with 1886, 21 less were admitted at Lahore, and 5 more at Delhi. There were also two re-admissions at each of the two Asylums. 3. The total number of lunatics treated in the province during the year was 487, of whom 387 were males and 100 females, or 22 males less and 4 females more than in the year 1886. 4. At Lahore 28 were discharged cured, 17 were handed over to friends, and 2 escapes were made, one of whom was re-captured. At Delhi 22 were discharged cured, 12 were made over to friends, and 4 discharged as not insane. 5. Thirteen criminal lunatics (including one re-admission) were admitted into the Lahore Asylum during 1887, and 5 into the Delhi Asylum. The total number of this class treated in both Asylums was 72. 6. The year has been very unhealthy both at Lahore and Delhi owing to malarious fever which prevailed in the Asylums. In the former there were 434 (including those remaining from last year) admissions into hospital with 37 deaths, against 329 admissions and 21 deaths in 1886. Of the 37 deaths, 7 were from pneumonia, 5 from diarrh2 8. The cost per head of each lunatic at Lahore was Rs. 101-14-3, or Rs. 5-14-5 in excess of the cost for the previous year. The increase is said to be due to the enhanced price of provisions, the supplying of extra nourishment to the lunatics during the fever epidemic that prevailed, and to the admission of one European, one Eurasian and one Parsi lunatic into the Asylum. The cost per head at Delhi was Rs. 90-9-7, or Re. 1-8-1 less than in 1886. This reduction, it is said, would have been more marked had it not been for the unusually high prices of food-grains. I have lately commenced checking the monthly contingent and dieting bills of the Lunatic Asylums, much on the same principle as the Jail bills are checked; and though it cannot be expected that the cost of maintaining lunatics will be reduced to the same figure as the cost of maintaining prisoners, I have every confidence that the scrutiny of the monthly bills of the Asylums will result in a considerable decrease in the cost of these institutions, without any detri- ment to their efficiency. 9. At Lahore there were 12 paying-patients during the year for whom Rs. 951-6-5 were received. At Delhi the number was the same as at Lahore, but Rs. 618 only were received for their maintenance. 10. There has been a decrease in the net profits on account of manufac- tures at the Lahore Asylum compared with 1886 ; the amounts realized in the two years being Rs. 1,047-10-9 and Rs. 1,201-3-9, respectivly. At Delhi there has also been a falling off in this respect, the profits being Rs. 768-15-10, against Rs. 811-2-3 in the previous year, or Rs. 42-2-5 less. The decrease at Lahore is attributed to the want of a workshop for weaving in the dangerous ward, which is now being supplied ; while that at Delhi is owing to the small profit derived from grinding wheat which was Rs. 51-8-0 less than in the year 1886 : but the real truth is that large or regular profits from a manufactory carried on by lunatics can never be expected. The employment of these men on trades and occupations must be looked on as a curative rather than a financial measure. 11. The question of an improved water-supply for the two Asylums is already before Government; that relating to the Delhi Asylum only having been recently submitted. 12. There has been a revision in the establishment of the Lahore Asy- lum which had effect from the 1st January 1888, and it is therefore unnecessary to make any mention of it here. The conduct of the subordinates is reported to have been unsatisfactory; one having been imprisoned, 11 dismissed and 3 fined during the year; while the matron in charge was severely censured for irregularities occurring in the female ward. As regards Delhi, the report affecting the establishment is also unsatisfac- tory ; and is to be regretted, particularly in regard to the Deputy Superintendent, Mr. Bernard, whose exertions in reducing the cost of maintenance of the lunatics last year was specially commended. 13. I quite agree with the Superintendent of the Lahore Lunatic Asylum in thinking the building utterly unsuited to the requirements of such an institution. I have during the past season gone over this Asylum several times, and each time I have noticed and remarked on the defects of the various buildings. I do not see how anything short of abandoning the present, and building an entirely new, Asylum will properly meet and remedy the defects, in plan and construction, existing in the present buildings, and I think it would prove the most economical course in the long run to deal with the matter thus. I have, &c., A. M. DALLAS, Inspector -General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab.
3 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE LAHORE LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1887. Population. On the 1st January 1887 there remained in the Asylum 226 males, and 56 females, giving a total of 282 patients. The fresh admissions during the year amounted to 58, 48 of whom were males, and 10 females. There were two re-admissions, both males. The total population was therefore males 276, females 66. Of this number, 47 were discharged, of whom 28 were cured, viz., 23 males and 5 females. There were handed over to their friends on security 17 males, of these 13 were improved, and 4 not improved. Two males have escaped, one of whom was re-captured. The deaths were 37, consisting of 28 males and 9 females. There now remains in the Asylum 258, of these 206 are males, and 52 females. The daily average strength was 266.48 against 282.30 in the previous year. Criminal lunatics. 2. Thirty-six criminal lunatics remained from previous year, and 13 were admitted, making a total of 49; of these 3 males and 1 female were considered capable of making their defence, 1 male was transferred to jail on recovery, 4 were transferred to the non-criminal class at the expiration of their terms of imprisonment, and 2 died. The daily average strength was 36.01 and 36.79 in the previous year. The criminal lunatics are kept for security in a separate part of the Asylum in common with the other dangerous lunatics, and have their irons removed whenever this is considered safe. Religion, sex and resi- dence. 3. Of the 60 admissions during the year, including re-admissions, there were 28 Hinds, of whom 26 were males and 2 females; Muhammadans 28, of whom 21 were males and 7 females. There were two Christians, 1 male and 1 female, and two males of other castes. Of these new admissions 45 were natives of the Punjab, 5 of other provinces, 2 of Native States, and 1 came from beyond British territory. The residences of the remaining 7 lunatics are not known. Previous occupation and ages of lunatics admitted during the year. 4. Of the total admissions, 19 were labourers and cultivators, 7 beggars, 2 students, 21 trades or callings of various kinds, and in 11 cases the occupations were not known. There were four admissions under the age of 20, 46 between 20 and 40, and 8 were between 40 and 60, and 2 were over 60. Typos of insanity. 5. The different types of insanity admitted were acute mania 37, chronic mania 11, melancholia 10, imbeciles 1, and puerperal mania 1. Causes of insanity. 6. The history obtained of lunatics on admission is most defective. This is usually made out by ignorant persons, and is of little use in supplying any information regarding the cause of insanity. Several cases after admission, however, can be traced to the use of Indian hemp. In other cases, grief, exposure to the sun, fever, and hereditary tendency, appears to have been the cause. Sickness and mortality. 7. The past year has been most unhealthy, and a severe form of fever of a malarious type was very prevalent in the Asylum. It reduced the health of the insanes considerably, and the high mortality which occurred, can only be attributed to this cause. The death-rate which reached 13.88 per cent. on the daily average strength, has not been so high since 1881. The total admissions into hospital were 434, against 329 in the previous year, and the daily average number sick was 36.85 against 26.42. Of the total treated in hospital 364 were discharged cured, 1 relieved, and 37 died, and 32 remain under treatment. The cause of deaths were4 extra nourishment to lunatics during the fever epidemic, and to the admission of three lunatics, consisting of one European, one Parsi and one Eurasian :5 only paid Rs. 4 per mensem, and on this small salary refuse to remain all day on the premises. In an establishment of this kind sweepers should be always present, for many of the lunatics are most filthy in their habits, and require constant attention. Clothing. 19. The clothing is very fair, but the blankets are not sufficiently mulled. A great improvement could be made in the clothing if it were all manufac- tured on the premises, under the eye of the Superintendent as is the case in jails. Garden. 20. The garden is well cropped with vegetables, and the labour of the lunatics is employed in raising crops. A little more ground, however, might be taken up for a garden, and then, with the aid of a good gardener, a plentiful supply of fresh vegetables could always be obtained. I attempted to do away with the use of bullocks for the garden, and obtain canal instead of well water for irrigation. The Canal Officer, however, informed me he could not undertake to supply me. This is a question which I think, however, might be again raised. Bullocks are expensive to keep, are constantly falling ill, and a better crop of vegetables could be raised, if the canal water was supplied. I can see no objection to its use in the garden. Escapes. 21. Two lunatics have escaped during the year under report. One was recaptured and brought back to the Asylum, and nothing has been heard of the other as yet. Immediate information regarding these escapes were communicated to the police, and also to the Deputy Commissioner of the districts where the lunatics resided. The escapes occurred in both instances through negligence on the part of the warders in charge, two of whom were dismissed. Change in superior esta- blishment. 22. It perhaps ought not to be referred to in this report, but it may be mentioned . that from 1st January 1888 the Deputy Superintendent has been replaced by a third class Assistant Surgeon, and a Daroga has been appointed.

Thirteen were admitted suffering from acute mania., 3 from chronic mania, 9 from melancholia, 8 from acute dementia, 2 from chronic dementia, 6 from idiotcy, and 4 from monomania, and 5 were found not insane. Causes of insanity. In 15 cases the cause was alleged to be the use of intoxicat- ing drugs, in 4 fever, in 2 the effects of exposure to the sun, in 11 to grief, loss of money, &c. Sickness and mortality. There were 118 admissions to hospital, against 109 in the year previous. The daily average sick was 7.00 against 10.00 in 1886. There were 13 deaths, viz., phthisis 2, pneumonia 3, dysentery 4, general debility 1, pleurisy 1, chronic Bright's disease 1, general dropsy 1. Of the lunatics who died, two had been 16 years in the Asylum, 3 ten years, 4 four years, 2 three years, and 2 less than six months. Many of the lunatics have suffered severely in previous years when malarial fevers have been prevalent. The past year was very unhealthy and the lunatics suffered in common with all other sections of the community with the result that at the end of the year a great many were in bad health. Prophylactics in the shape of quinine or cinchona febrifuge and lime juice were administered freely while fevers prevailed ; tonics and a daily allowance of fresh milk were given to those whese health had suffered. Many of the lunatics throw off their clothing and bedding, and in this way expose themselves to chill which is of course calculated to produce disease. Again many are very capricious and refuse their food from time to time. In such cases, although artificial feeding is resorted to, their health suffers. The Deputy Superin- tendent and other officials have been frequently warned to take particular care to see as far as possible that the lunatics wear their clothes and use their bedding. In fact as far as practicable all measures calculated to avert sickness and mortality are adopted, and I would hope with greater care on the part of subordinate officials the health of the Asylum will be improved. Diet, &c. The dietary is sufficient. Ample clothing and bedding are provided, while the sick are allowed any diet considered necessary for them. Of the 50 lunatics admitted, 13 were found in good health, 10 in indifferent health, 27 in bad health, the condition of 3 being very bad.
19 Expenditure. The total expenditure including the cost of repairs by the District Board, was Rs. 10,254-1-8 against Rs. 10,601-6-8 in 1886. The average cost per head has been Rs. 90-9-7, being a reduction of Re. 1-8-1 on that of the previous year. Had it not been that prices were unusually high a, more marked reduction would have been effected. While the cost of maintenance has been reduced, the diet has remained what it was previously. Sufficient bedding and clothing have been provided ; the sick in hospital get plenty of milk, soup, fresh eggs and stimulants if necessary, and extra milk is given to those whose digestive powers have become impaired through sickness or other cause. The following are the items of expenditure per head for 1886 and 1887 .ANNUAL STATEMENT No. I.

No. 470. FROM C. L. TUPPER, ESQUIRE, Secretary to Government, Punjab and its Dependencies, TO R. GRAY, ESQUIRE, M. B., Offg. Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab. Dated 16th August 1889. Home. Medical and Sanitary. SIR, I AM directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1941, dated 16th May 1889, submitting the reports of the Lunatic Asylums at Lahore and Delhi for the year 1888, together with the remarks of Deputy Surgeon-General Farrell thereon. 2. The reports which were due in this office on the 15th April were not received till the 17th of May. 3. Allowing for new admissions and discharges, the population of the two Asylums has remained practically stationary during the year. On the 31st of December 1888 the number of inmates was at Lahore three less and at Delhi one more than on the 1st of January of the same year. 4. Judging from the number of admissions to hospital, the health of the Lahore Asylum was unsatisfactory; but the daily average number of sick was reduced by nearly one-half, while the mortality was reduced to 13 deaths against 37 in the previous year. The health of the Delhi Asylum has im- proved. The water-supply of both Asylums is good. 5. The "analysis of the alleged causes of insanity " (Statement No. VII) has, in accordance with the wishes of the Government of India, been prepared to show in detail the number of cases in which insanity has resulted from the abuse of intoxicating drugs and spirits. It will be seen that Indian hemp, particularly in the form of charas, has been the most potent of the alleged causes of insanity, and that in no case has the disease been ascribed to the use of madak or chandu. It may be observed that the policy of the Punjab Government has of recent years been directed to the suppression of madak and chandu smoking. 6. The expenditure in both Asylums during the year 1888 shows an increase over the figures for the previous year. In the case of the Lahore Asylum it is explained that this increase is due to the Public Works charges, which amounted to Rs. 5,586-3-5. The Lahore building has been reported to be entirely unsuited for the requirements of an Asylum, and, in pursuance of the remarks on this subject contained in the Review of last year's Report, the
( 2 ) Superintendent is now engaged in drawing up a special report on the question of providing a new Asylum. Meanwhile I am to suggest for your consideration whether in view of the possibility of the abandonment of the existing building it is advisable to incur any large Public Works expenditure thereon. In addition to the new buildings mentioned in paragraph 15 of Dr. Center's report, it has been lately arranged that canal water shall be introduced into the Asylum in substitution for the present costly system of well irrigation. All such im- provements will of course supply additional arguments in favour of the reten- tion of the present building when the question of a new Asylum comes before Government. 7. The increased cost of maintenance of the lunatics at the Delhi Asylum, which in 1887 was Rs. 90-9-7 per head and in 1888 Rs. 103-5-10, is not altogether satisfactorily explained. It was to have been expected that the diet charges would show a decrease, as the prices of food grains were generally lower in 1888 than in 1887. The Lieutenant-Governor will be glad to receive any explanation which can be suggested regarding the increase of more than Rs. 12 per head in that Asylum. I have, &c., C. L. TUPPER, Secretary to Government, Punjab. Punjab Government Prees, Lahore.No. 1630. FROM G. FARRELL, ESQUIRE, C.B., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab, TO C. L. TUPPER, ESQUIRE, Secretary to Government, Punjab. Dated LAHORE, 24th April 1889. SIR, I have the honor to forward the report of the Lahore and Delhi Lunatic Asylums for the year 1888. 2. On the 1st January 1888, there were 258 lunatics in the Lahore Asylum, of whom 206 were males and 52 females. At Delhi, on the same date, there were 94 lunatics, of whom 68 were males and 26 females. During the year there were 55 admissions to the Lahore Asylum, 47 males and 8 females ; one of these, a male lunatic, being a re-admission. At Delhi there were 48 admissions, 41 males and 7 females, which include two re-admissions, 1 male and 1 female. The admissions to both asylums last year are 7 less than they were in the previous year, the figures being 110 for 1887 and 103 for 1888. The admissions at the Lahore Asylum were 3 males and 2 females under what they were the previous year, and at Delhi 2 males in excess and 4 females under what they were in 1887. 3. The total number of lunatics treated at both asylums last year was 455, of whom 362 were males and 93 females. In 1887,487 lunatics were treated, 387 being males and 100 females. 4. At Lahore 32 lunatics, 29 males and 3 females, were discharged cured, being 10.2 per cent. of the total number treated. Eleven lunatics, 10 males and 1 female, whose symptoms had improved, and 2 harmless lunatics, were all made over to their friends for safe custody on security. This gives 14.3 as the total percentage of cured and relieved in this' Asylum. At Delhi, 13 lunatics, 12 males and 1 female, were discharged cured, being 9.1 per cent, of the total treated, a result slightly under that obtained at Lahore. Eleven lunatics, 7 males and 4 females, were made over to their friends on security, which raises the percentage of cured and relieved at this Asylum to 16.9, which is a better result than obtained at Lahore. 5. The escape of one non-criminal male lunatic is recorded from the Delhi Asylum on the 7th December last, and up to date no traces of the man have been found. The matter has been investigated, and would appear to have been due to the carelessness of the Deputy Superintendent, Mr. Barnard, who has been heavily fined for this neglect of duty by the Superintendent. 6. I find that 7 males and 1 female have been discharged from the Delhi Asylum as not being insane. I have ascertained that these cases were sent to the Civil Surgeon, Delhi, who is also Superintendent of the Asylum, as suspected lunatics, and were kept in the asylum under observation till the Superiuten- dent satisfied himself they were not insane, when they were discharged. I do not think cases of this kind should be recorded in this return, which is one for certified lunatics only. I shall take ste ps that in future such cases are not included.
2 7. At the close of the year, there were 43 criminal lunatics, 39 males and 4 females, in the Lahore Asylum. At Delhi there were 14 of this class, 13 males and 1 female. The total number treated at both asylums was 70,64 males and 6 females. At Lahore 11 males and 3 females were admitted3 In the Lahore Asylum the increased expenditure of Rs. 2,188-13-11 is due to the increased cost of work done by the Department of Public Works ; Rs. 5,586-3-5 being shown as expended in column 24 of Statement IX. The increase of Rs. 1,646-0-9 shown in the Delhi Asylum is due to increased cost of establishment, food for patients, and contingent expenditure as clothing and furniture for the convalescent ward. There is no uniformity observed in calculating the cost per head of lunatics in either of the asylums, and I contemplate issuing early orders in this matter. I think that the cost of each lunatic should be shown under three dis- tinct heads, viz. :4 13. It will be observed that in Statement VII the revised form pres- cribed by the Government of India in Resolution No. 9/7005 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE LAHORE LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1888. 1.

Population.9 The increase under the head " Establishment" is due to a 1st class Hospital Assistant on Rs. 55 per mensem having been attached to the asylum from 28th April 1888, The increase in diet charges is due to extra diet allowed to the weakly patients throughout the year. The increase on clothing is due to new clothing and bedding for winter supply. The increase on contingencies is due to warders' clothing and furniture, &c., purchased for the convalescent wards. A bullock for the garden was also purchased to replace one which died. 1887. 1888. Rs. A. P. Rs. A. P.

No. 267. FROM H. MAUDE, ESQUIRE, Offg. Junior Secretary to Government, Punjab and its Dependencies, TO THE INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF CIVIL HOSPITALS, PUNJAB. Dated Lahore, 7th May 1890. Home. Medical and Sanitary. SIR, I AM directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1452, dated the 15th of April 1890, submitting with your remarks the reports of the Luna- tic Asylums at Lahore and Delhi for the year 1889. 2. These reports which were due in the Civil Secretariat on the 15th of April arrived in good time on the 16th idem. They are due with the Govern- ment of India on the 15th of May. 3. The following table shows the number of inmates in each Asylum on the 1st of January 1890, as compared with the number on the corresponding date of the previous year. The table also gives particulars of the admissions and discharges of patients during the year 1889 :( 2 ) 4. At the end of the year 1889 the population of the two Asylums was less by 17 than it had been at the end of the year 1888, the total number of inmates of the Lahore Asylum having fallen from 255 to 241 and those of the Delhi Asylum from 95 to 92, a decrease respectively of 14 and 3. 5. There were 76 criminal, lunatics altogether under treatment in the two Asylums during the year under review, 68 males and 8 females. This latter number included a woman who was discharged from the Lahore Asylum, but had to be re-admitted. 6. The percentage of cures at the Delhi Asylum, which amounted to 20.7, was satisfactory. That attained at the Lahore Asylum, viz., 8.7, was not so satisfactory, and was less than the percentage, 10.2, reached in the year 1888. It is reported from both Asylums that the use of Indian hemp drunk as " bhang " or smoked as "charas" is a fertile source of lunacy. Other causes are intoxi- cating liquors, sun, grief, &c. As previously remarked, " madak " and " chandu " smoking is not common in the Punjab. 7. The health of the inmates of the Lahore Asylum was better on the whole than in the year 1888. The mortality was, however, higher, 37 having died in 1889 against 13 in 1888. The Asylum was visited by the epidemic of cholera which prevailed in Lahore in the months of August and September; but, as you have remarked, this does not account fully for the large increase in the number of deaths. The Lieutenant-Governor observes that you propose to make enquiries into the matter, and His Honor will be glad to receive a report of the result of your investigations. He would wish you also to consider whether when a change next occurs in the appointment of Civil Surgeon of Lahore, it would not be possible and advisable to transfer the charge of the Lunatic Asylum to a Medical Officer with less demands on his time, such as one of the Professors of the Medical College. It is again brought to notice that the building in which the patients are accommodated is unsuited for the purposes of a lunatic asylum. There seems to be nothing objectionable on sanitary grounds in the nature of the site or of the buildings, though no doubt the European residents of the neighbourhood would like to see the Asylum removed to a distance. The objections seem to lie chiefly in defective arrangements for the classification of patients and for the separation of dangerous from harmless lunatics. The Lieutenant-Governor desires that you will be so good as to furnish a report showing what steps have been taken to carry out the improvements in the building suggested by His Honor in the month of December last. The question of providing a new asylum which would be very expensive must stand over until funds are available. With reference to the remark of the Superintendent of the Asylum that the improvements to the present building will necessitate an increase in the establishment of warders, I am to say that no extra establishment should be entertained without the previous sanction of Government 8. The health of the Delhi Asylum was fairly good in the year 1889, and does not call for comment, while the death rate was much lower than in the year 1888. 9. The Lieutenant-Governor approves of the instructions which you have issued in view to ensuring uniformity in calculating the cost per head of lunatics in both Asylums. 10. In the matter of expenditure the Lieutenant-Governor observes from paragraph 23 of your letter that the net expenditure per head has decreased at Lahore by Rs. 3-6-3 on the net cost for the year 1888, and that at Delhi the decrease amounts to Rs. 7-11-8 per head. This is satisfactory. It appears, however, that the cost of diet per head in the Lahore Asylum is still high, being Rs. 41-0-11 as against Rs. 36-14-10 at Delhi. The result of the enquiry you are making in the matter should be reported for the information of Government.
( 3 ) The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to observe that a careful check is apparently being kept on the contingent expenditure of both asylums. A sum of Rs. 340-4-8 was recovered from paying patients at Lahore, and Rs. 112-3-5 at Delhi. The Superintendents of both asylums report that endeavours are made to recover the cost of the maintenance of lunatics from their relatives; but it is unfortunate that the efforts made do not meet with more success. Statement IV, however, shows that the majority of the patients admitted belong to the poorest classes of society. 11. The Lieutenant-Governor regrets to observe that the conduct of the establishments of the two asylums, and especially at Delhi, was not alto- gether good. The entertainment of pensioned sepoys as warders at the Lahore Asylum has so far proved a success, and the system might be extended to the Delhi Asylum as opportunities occur. Application might be made as vacancies occur to the Commissioner of the Division, who maintains a list of pensioned native soldiers desirous of civil employ. I have, &c., H. MAUDE, Offg. Junior Secretary to Government, Punjab. Punjab Government Press, LahoreNo. 1251. FROM G. FARRELL, ESQUIRE, C.B., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab. TO C. L. TUPPER, ESQUIRE, Secretary to Government, Punjab. Dated LAHORE, the 1st March 1890. SIR, I have the honor to forward the reports of the Lahore and Delhi Lunatic Asylums for the year 1889. 2. On the 1st January 1889, there were 255 lunatics in the Lahore Asylum, of whom 201 were males and 54 females. At Delhi on the same date, there were 95 inmates, 72 of whom were males and 23 females. During the year, 65 were admitted into the Lahore Asylum, including 3 re-admissions. Fifty-six of these were males and 9 females. At Delhi 35 were admitted into the Asylum, including 2 re-admissions. Thirty of these were males and 5 females. 3. Thus, at Lahore, there were 10 more admissions in 1889 than in 1888, while at Delhi Asylum the new admissions fell from 48 in 1888 to 35 last year. The admissions into both Asylums in 1888 were 103, while in 1889 they were 100, or 3 less. 4. The total number of lunatics treated at both Asylums in 1889 amounted to 450, of whom 359 were males and 91 females. In the year previ- ous, 455 were under treatment, 362 being males and 93 females. Thus, the total number under treatment last year shows a decrease of 3 male and 2 female lunatics compared with that of 1888. 5. At Lahore, 25 male and 3 female lunatics were discharged cured, a percentage of 8.7 of the total number treated, which is not so good a percent- age as in 1888, viz., 10.2. Nine lunatics, including 1 female, were made over to friends on security as improved, and 2 males and 1 female who had not improved, but who were harmless, were similarly treated. This gives 11.5 per cent. of cured and improved lunatics in the Lahore Asylum compared with 14.3 per cent. in 1888, which included 2 harmless lunatics made over to friends. 6. At Delhi, 23 males and 4 females were discharged cured, being 20.7 per cent. of the total treated. This is more than double the percentage of cures in 18882 to 314 last year. The admissions to hospital decreased from 407 to 295 last year. These figures would be satisfactory, were it not that the mortality has been unusually high last year, as I shall notice further on; but this apart, the above figures show that the general health of this Asylum has been more favorable than in 1888. 9. Intermittent fever, ulcers, acute bronchitis, diarrh3 The death-rate at Lahore was 146.9 per mille, and at Delhi 62.3 per mille. Malarial fevers were the chief cause of admissions in both Asylums. Dysentery, diarrh4 21. In comparing the cost per head at both Asylums, I find that the net charge for each lunatic was at Delhi Rs. 5-15-2 in excess of what it was at Lahore. But the difference in estimating the net charge at each Asylum makes this comparison not quite exact, because the item of lunatics' labor, which is included in the cost per head at Delhi, has been excluded at Lahore. If this expenditure be added, the net charge per head at Lahore will be Rs. 93-11-9 against Rs. 95-10-2 at Delhi, showing only an excess of Re. 1-14-5 per head at the latter Asylum. 22. I find that the establishment at the Delhi Asylum costs Rs. 47-8-1 per head, while at the Lahore Asylum it costs Rs. 44-2-10 per head, which shows a difference of Rs. 3-5-3 in favor of Lahore. The higher cost at Delhi is, I think, explained by the fact that the establishment must be proportionally more costly in the smaller Asylum. The cost of dieting per head is at Lahore Rs. 41-0-11, and at Delhi Rs. 36-14-10. This difference is not so easy of explanation, as it is not ap- parent why it should cost annually over Rs. 4 per head more to feed a lunatic at Lahore than it does at Delhi. The price current of food supplies at both places explains to some extent the difference, but there appears to be a different and more expensive diet scale in use at Lahore than at Delhi. I shall enquire into this matter. Under contingencies, the expenditure in both Asylums is nearly the same, being Rs. 5-11-11 per head at Delhi and Rs. 5-0-4 per head at Lahore. The monthly contingent bills of both Asylums are checked in my office, and I do not think any reductions are feasible. The expenditure under the head of bedding and clothing was also very similar in both Asylums, being Rs. 6-2-7 per head at Lahore and Rs. 5-5-5 at Delhi. The expenditure seems reasonable in both Asylums. 23. It will be seen from the figures I have quoted that the net expend- iture per head has decreased at Lahore last year by Rs. 3-6-3 from what it was in 1888, the calculation being based for purposes of comparison on the system adopted in 1888. At Delhi, there was a reduction of Rs. 7-11-8 per head, which is satisfactory. Notwithstanding the reduction, the net cost per head at Delhi is Rs. 5-15-2 more than at Lahore, which may be ascribed to the fact that at Lahore the value of lunatics' labor is omitted from the calculation, columns 15 to 20, Statement IX., and to the smaller number of lunatics at Delhi, which proportionately increases the cost of establishment. 24. The net profit from manufactures at Lahore during the last year was Rs. 1,396-14-11 compared with Rs. 1,232-9-3 in 1888, being an increase of Rs. 164-5-8. At Delhi the profits amounted to Rs. 606-12-7, against Rs. 792-14-8, being a decrease of Rs. 186-2-1. The falling off at Delhi is ascribed to the fact that there was a large supply of clothing in stock at the close of 1888 and only a small number of blankets were made. 25. Year after year attention has been drawn to the condition of the Asylum building at Lahore. His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor paid the insti- tution a visit in December last, and came to the conclusion that the building of a new Asylum in a more suitable locality was not feasible owing to financial considerations. He pointed out certain alterations in the present building which will improve matters, and a scheme in accordance with these has been submitted. 26. At Delhi, certain improvements have been effected during the year. A boiler and soaking tank were completed, drains are under construction, and the solitary cells have been ventilated.
5 27. Although the conduct of the establishment attached to the two Asylums was, on the whole, good, it was necessary to inflict some heavy punish- ments during the year. A warder was dismissed from the Lahore Asylum for neglect of duty in connection with the lunatic who committed suicide by using the string of a pyjama, and one was dismissed at Delhi for permitting a lunatic to escape. At Delhi, one warder was reduced and another fined. The Superin- tendent of the Lahore Asylum has employed five military pensioners as warders, and finds that they work satisfactorily. If pensioned sepoys could be obtained, they would in many ways be better than the classes from which warders are now recruited. G. FARRELL, Inspector-General of Civil Hospital, Punjab.

In previous years the Public Works charges were not included under the cost per head, while they have been this year, as suggested by the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals. Such charges are not included by the Jail Department when calculating the cost per head of prisoners. 13. Paying Patients.9 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DELHI LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1889.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE PUNJAB FOR THE YEAR 1890. Published by Authority. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Lahore: THE "CIVIL AND MILITARY GAZETTE" PRESS, Contractors to the Punjab Government. 1891.
Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in the Home (Medical and Sanitary) Depart- ment, No. 271, dated, 12th May 1891, READ( 2 ) 2. There were 14 fewer patients admitted to the two Asylums in the year 1890 than in the previous year, and there was a falling-off of 31 in the total number of patients treated at the two institutions, thus( 3 ) in the year under review were very much less than in either of the years 1887 and 1888 in each of which more than Rs. 1,500 were recovered, so there is room for considerable improvement, which will follow if the orders issued in August last are attended to. 8. The classification of the different forms of insanity has been carried out in accordance with the orders of the Government of India in the Home Department, No. 3/147, dated the 28th of February 1890. Also in accordance with the orders from that Department, No. 9 Medical/497, dated the 25th of July 1890, the cost per head of lunatics is shown under the several heads of expenditure. Finally, the Lieutenant-Governor is glad to observe that improvements in view to adding to the health and comfort of the unfortunate and helpless inmates of the two Asylums either have been, or are being, carried out. ORDER.No. 915. FROM G. FARRELL, ESQUIRE, C.B., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab, To H. C. FANSHAWE, ESQUIRE, Offg. Chief Secretary to Government, Punjab. Dated LAHORE, the 2nd April 1891. SIR, I have the honor to forward the reports of the Lahore and Delhi Lunatic Asylums for the year 1890. 2. On the 1st January 1890 there were 241 lunatics in the Lahore Asylum, of whom 193 were males and 48 females. At the Delhi Asylum, on the same date, there were 92 lunatics, of whom 70 were males and 22 females. During the year, 59 were admitted at Lahore2 9. Intermittent fever, diarrh3 19. The expenditure of the two Asylums for the years 1889 and 1890 was as follows:4 26. I cannot help thinking that the cost of establishment in both Asylums is susceptible of reduction. I find that the cost per head of establish- ment at the Asylums in the North-Western and Central Provinces is much lower than in the Punjab. At Lahore the medical establishment and the clerk and darogha are very costly, and the number of warders and sweepers is also high. This Asylum is, however, peculiar, and the buildings, never intended for such a purpose, are straggling and difficult to keep secure. At Delhi the number of warders, cooks, and gardeners appears high when compared with other Asylums. The buildings here are very compact, and I do not see why larger establishments are required at this Asylum than at other Asylums with even a greater number of inmates. I propose addressing Superintendents on these points, and submitting a report to Government. 27. The cost of dieting per head at Lahore was Rs. 41-8-10 in 1890, which is Rs. 0-7-11 in excess of what it was in 1889. The Superintendent gives no explanation of this. At Delhi it was Rs. 36-13-5, which is a decrease of 0-1-5 on what it was in 1889. The cost per head of dieting at Lahore was Rs. 4-11-5 higher than it was at Delhi, compared with Rs. 4-2-1 in 1889. 28. Under this head also the expenditure in the Punjab Asylums com- pares very unfavorably with that in the Asylums of the North-Western and the Central Provinces. At the Nagpur Asylum the diet cost Rs. 26-6-8 per head, against Rs. 36-13-5 per head at Delhi. At Lahore, where European and Eurasian lunatics are sometimes confined, the cost is of necessity higher, but making due allowance for this, the cost per head of dieting in this Asylum is not only above that at Delhi, but higher than at any other Lunatic Asylum in the North- Western or the Central Provinces. I have already enquired into this matter, as stated in my paragraph 22 of the Report for 1889, and it would appear that the excess in the diet rate at Lahore over that at Delhi is due to the main- tenance at times of European and Eurasian lunatics at the former, to extra diet to laboring lunatics, and pickles and spices being used as articles of diet. With- out access to the diet scales of other Asylums it is impossible to assign a cause for the high rates in the Punjab; but I propose enquiring into this matter, and will furnish a separate report to Government. 29. Under " Contingencies " the expenditure per head is again much the same in both Asylums. At Lahore it was Rs. 5-9-2, against Rs. 5-0-4 in 1889; and at Delhi Rs. 5-14-8, against Rs. 5-11-11. I think the difference may be fairly ascribed to the variation in the population in the years referred to, as this expenditure in several items is not influenced by the number of inmates. 30. Under " Bedding and clothing," the cost per head at the Lahore Asylum was Rs. 9-13-8, against Rs. 6-2-7 in 1889; and at Delhi Rs. 6-2-0, against Rs. 5-5-5 in 1889. The increased cost at Lahore of Rs. 3-11-8 is due to the supply of blanket-suits and a larger issue of blankets owing to the severe winter. There has been a slight increase of expenditure at Delhi. 31. It is satisfactory to note that 71.2 per cent. of the lunatics in the Lahore Asylum were employed on manufactures, such as weaving blankets, making baskets, chicks, &c.;or on manual labor, as cultivating the garden, grinding wheat, &c. This shows a small improvement on the year previous, when 65.1 per cent. were employed. 32. At Delhi only 58 per cent. of the lunatics were employed on manu- factures or labor, which is, however, a larger percentage than in the previous year, when it was 48.8 per cent. At Delhi the facilities for employing lunatics are small, but every effort should be made to give employment of some kind or other. 33. The net profits from manufactures at Lahore during 1890 were Rs. 1,582-11-2, compared with Rs. 1,396-14-11 in 1889, being an increase in favor of last year of Rs. 185-12-3. At Delhi the profits amounted to Rs. 732-13-4, compared with Rs. 606-12-7 in 1889, showing an increase for last year of Rs. 126-0-9. It is satisfactory to note thatboth Asylums show increases in this respect to the extent of Rs. 311-13-0, although the average number of lunatics in each Asylum was less than in 1889.
5 34. Considerable improvements are being carried out in the buildings of both Asylums. At Lahore, the segregation of different classes of lunatics is being carried out, which necessitates considerable alteration in the internal arrangements of the building, as described by the Superintendent. The garden has also been enlarged, so that there will be room for the further employment of lunatics in this way. Better arrangements are also being made for storing drinking-water and improving the present inadequate bathing arrangements. At the Delhi Asylum, the chief improvement has been the completion of the system of surface drainage throughout the Asylum, and the substitution of iron- grated doors in the solitary cells, barracks, hospital, &c., which is being gradually carried out. The ventilation has also been improved in the hospital and cells for female lunatics. 35. It is a matter of regret that of the five military pensioners employed in the Lahore Asylum, one died and two resigned owing to dislike of their duties. It is unfortunate that the experiment has not proved more satisfactory. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, G. FARRELL, Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab.
6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE LAHORE LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1890. 1. Population.7 The average mortality of the Lahore Asylum in the last ten years has been 9.77 per cent. In non-cholera years 7.79, in the cholera years 14.39, in the same, excluding cholera, 11.41. The mortality in 1890 was 11.53. The average mortality per cent. in Indian native asylums from 1880 to 1889 was 9.19. The death-rates in the several asylums noted were : Delhi. Agra. Bareilly. Lucknow. Jubbulpore. Nagpore. Lahore. 1888 ... 15.04 7.67 8.99 16.63 4.95 9.12 5.06 1889 ... 6.23 8.38 7.12 9.48 15.16 25.47 14.69 In Lahore both 1889 and 1890 were unhealthy years ; cholera prevailed in the former, and a cholera year is an unhealthy one generally. The year under review was unhealthy on account of the prevalence and severity of malarious fever. This in the worst cases assumed the remittent type. A bad fever year leaves the population weakened and liable to succumb to other diseases. The following shows the mortality per 1,000 in suburban Lahore in which the asylum is situated:8 YEAR. 14 15 16 17 18 19 Gross cost per head.

There was really a reduction of three warders. The increase on clothing is due to the winter season having been very cold. Mulled blanket suits were made and a larger supply of blankets was manufactured and issued. The increase on medicines is chiefly due to the adjustment of the cost of Europe medicines supplied in 1889 in the accounts of the year under report. The slight increase in contingencies is due to the purchase of a hand- power flour-mill. 12. Paying Patients.9 on another site, but as the finances did not allow of this, the present buildings are being modified. The site is an old Sikh cavalry barrack, built on the plan of a serai. One portion of the enclosure had been walled off as the female ward, and another as the criminal ward where special watch and guard were kept, and for this reason all dangerous cases came to be kept there, so that it was the criminal and dangerous ward. Portions of this are now walled off, 1st, for dangerous lunatics, criminal or not; 2nd, for filthy criminal lunatics. A similar arrangement is made in the female ward, and also a shady verandah is being built along the south end of the enclosure which will be a great comfort and convenience in the hot weather and rains. An addition has been made to the garden of 5 ghumos, and canal water has been sanctioned for irrigation. The well water in the old barrack is very saline, and unfit for drinking or irrigation. As a considerable number of the inmates are agriculturists their labor can be utilised for the production of fresh vegetables. Tanks for storing the municipal drinking-water in each ward are also being prepared, and better bathing arrangements made in each ward. The dispensary is also being enlarged and suitably fitted. 17.

Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in the Home (Medical and Sanitary) Department, No. 190, dated 23rd April 1892. READNo. 555. FROM J. CLEGHORN, ESQUIRE, M.D., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab, TO II. MAUDE, ESQUIRE, Officiating Junior Secretary to Government, Punjab. Dated LAHORE, the 1st March 1892. SIR, I have the honor to Forward the annual statements of the Lahore and Delhi Lunatic Asylums for the year 1891, and beg to submit Mm following remarks. 2. The population of these Asylums is shown in Statement I, and in Mm following abstract Mm principal facts connected with the alteration in the number of inmates are noted, and for purposes of comparison the corresponding figures for the three previous years are also given : 2 6. The number remaining under treatment on 31st December 1891, was 3403 be placed in the convalescent gang, and would not appear in the hospital returns. 18. The following table shows the principal causes of sickness and all the fatal cases for 1891 and the previous year, for both Asylums:4 22. Statement IX is financial and shows the receipts and expenditure. The following is an abstract of that statement and also one for the year 1890:5 24. The accompanying abstract cash account shows the expenditure under the different budget headings, and the cost per head of the inmates in each of the Asylums:6 25. In the Lahore Asylum the cost per head for establishment was Rs. 45-8-4, and in Delhi, Rs. 46-0-4, practically the same; but as the daily average number of inmates in the former was 236.07 and in the latter only 92.16, the cost per head in Lahore ought to have been much less than in Delhi. In both cases the cost is slightly less than in 1890; but, when compared with that of the Asy- lums of the North-Western Provinces, it appears excessive. In those Asylums the cost per head ranges from Rs. 25 to Rs. 35, or a difference on the higher rate of Rs. 10. The defective structural arrangements and numerous subdivi- sions in the Lahore Asylum necessitate the entertainment of a larger staff of warders than is usual, but not to the extent which has existed, and steps were taken in the latter part of the year to reduce the establishment and utilize the services of the inmates for the menial work of the Asylum. Reductions to a small extent have also been effected in the Delhi Asylum, but so long as the services of the Deputy Superintendent are retained, the cost per head in such a small Asylum will always be high. 26. The diet in the Lahore Asylum cost Rs. 41-1-11 per head, and in Delhi, Rs. 39-11-10. In 1890 it was Rs. 41-8-10 and Rs. 36-13-5, respectively. There appears no sufficient reason for such a difference, as the food rates in both dis- tricts must have been about the same. In the Asylums of the North-Western Provinces the cost of rations ranges from Rs. 29 to Rs. 31. The difference in the cost in the two sets of Asylums is partly accounted for by the inmates of the Punjab Asylums being on the whole better fed than those in the North-Western Provinces, and also that a daily ration of meat is issued in addition to the or- dinary cereal food. The diet scale in the Lahore Asylum has lately been revis- ed and brought more in uniformity with that in other Asylums. The scale is a liberal one, and quite sufficient for the requirements of Punjabis. 27. Clothing and Bedding.7 for the revision of establishment will be submitted for the sanction of Govern- ment. In Delhi, also, slight changes have been introduced, which were sanction- ed this month. 31. Statement XI shows the working of the factories. In Lahore, 65 per cent. of the inmates were employed in the service of the Asylum in the factory, and in Delhi, 61 per cent. The net profits of the former are returned at Rs. 1,192-1-1 and of the latter at Rs. 652-2-10. In 1890 the net profits were Rs. 1,582-11-2 and Rs. 732-13-4, respectively. The decrease in Lahore was owing to an interruption in the weaving of cloth from the fall of the workshop and the closing of the grinding shed, the atta being purchased from the Lahore flour mills. In Delhi the decrease of profits was due to the epidemic of influenza which stopped all work, and to the reconstruction of the grinding shed. 32. The sum of Rs. 656-2-3 was received at the Lahore Asylum for the maintenance of patients and Rs. 226-10-3 at Delhi. In 1890 the amounts receiv- ed were Rs. 702-13-6 and Rs. 274-12-2, respectively. 33. The buildings which have been utilized for the purposes of an Asylum at Lahore are very badly constructed and arranged, and are not suitable for the confinement of lunatics. The numerous subdivisions and enclosures increase the difficulties of watch and ward. The barracks cannot be properly ventilated, and, from the way in which they are arranged, it is impossible to provide suit- able latrines for the inmates during the night. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, JAMES CLEGHORN, Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab.

The charges for contin- gencies, however, though somewhat reduced at Delhi, are still open to the remark made in last year's Review, and no explanation is given. ORDER.No. 954. FROM SURGEON-COLONEL JAMES CLEGHORN, M.D., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab, To H. MAUDE, ESQUIRE, Junior Secretary to Government, Punjab. Dated Lahore, 1st April 1893. SIR, I have the honor to forward the annual returns of the Lahore and Delhi Lunatic Asylums for the year 1892. 2. The total population of the Asylums, as shown in Statement I, was 472, or 40 more than in 1891. The details regarding admissions and dis- charges are noted in the following abstract. The corresponding figures for 1891 are also given :2 6. Statement II, Criminal Lunatics.3 obtained from the local mills is the staple, and if there had been any defects in the food there would be an increase in bowel affections, but these cases show a decrease. 19. This is the seventh occasion within the last twenty years in which cholera has broken out in the Asylum. In the present instance it did not assume an epidemic form, as each of the 13 cases occurred as a rule on separate days, between the 1st August and 28th September, and in different parts of the Asylum. No connection could be traced between any two cases, and none of them were recent admissions. All the officials connected with the Asylum remained entirely free from the disease. Cases had previously occurred in the neighbouring railway barracks and in the district generally. 20. The death from suicide which appears in the returns occurred in the early morning when the inmates were being taken out of the barracks. The man was a harmless non-criminal lunatic, and hanged himself from the branch of a pipal tree with a strip of blanketing while the warder on duty was superin- tending the cleaning of the barrack. The matter was reported immediately to the Superintendent of Police, and an investigation held. 21. Statement IX shows the receipts and expenditure during the year. The following is an abstract of the statement with the corresponding figures for 1891 :4 ABSTRACT OF CASH ACCOUNT. ASYLUM. ESTABLISHMENT. DIET. CLOTHING AND BEDDING. MEDICINES. CONTINGENCIES.

5 23. The total expenditure per head of average daily strength, vide abstract appended to paragraph 21, was Rs. 100-0-4 as compared with Rs. 151-7-2 in 1891, and, on excluding that on Public Works, it was Rs. 90-7-6, or Rs. 8-3-4 less than in 1891. The decrease in expenditure per head in Lahore was Rs. 10-14-10 and in Delhi a few annas, vide the preceding abstract. 24. The reduction effected in establishment during the year resulted in a saving of Rs. 1,442-13-10 in Lahore and of Rs. 340-0-9 in Delhi. 25. As shewn inthe above abstract, there has been a slight decrease in all other heads of expenditure except in clothing and diet in Delhi and in contin- gencies in Lahore. The woollen clothing and blankets in the former were of very inferior quality and deficient in quantity. Sanction was given to the ex- penditure of Rs. 606-1-2 for the purchase of blankets. 26. Statement X contains a list of the sanctioned establishment. The following reductions were made in Lahore :APPENDIX.

Proceeding of the Hon'ble the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in the Home (Medical and Sanitary) Department, No. 32 S., dated 25th May 1894. READNo. 873. FROM SURGEON-COLONEL J. CLEGHORN, M.D., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab, To R. E. YOUNGHUSBAND, ESQUIRE, Offg. Junior Secretary to Government, Punjab. Dated Lahore, 2nd April 1894. SIR, I have the honor to forward the Annual Returns of the Lahore and Delhi Lunatic Asylums for the year 1893. 2. Population.2 11. The daily average strength was in 1893, 11.93 and in 1892, 9.22, 12. Escapes.3 28. In the hot weather months numbers of the lunatics are allowed to sleep in the open ; during the rains all sleep in barracks, but the doors are not, as a rule, closed. After the 15th October the wooden doors of the barracks are closed during the night. There is practically no ventilation, and the impure air, combined with the low temperature, gives rise to a low form of pneumonia and to the mortality noted above. Up to the 1st October there were only 3 deaths, in October 3, in November 4, and in December 12. Of the 16 deaths in the latter two months, 9 were from pneumonia and 2 from tuberele of the lungs. One death occurred from violence, due to neglect on the part of the warders. 29. The mortality on total population was 6.77, and on daily aver- age strength 8.88. 30. In the Delhi Asylum there were 80 patients admitted into hospital. The daily average sick was 4.26. There were 10 deaths from the following causes, viz., dysentery 2 and one each from erysipelas, debility, phthisis pulmonalis, anmia, meningitis, disease of heart, pneumonia and sloughing ulcer of scrotum. 31. The percentage of deaths to total population was 7.25 and to daily average strength 9.93. 32. Receipts and Expenditure.4 35. In the Delhi Asylum the total charges amounted to Rs. 13,461-7-4. Rs. 4,417-12-4 were expended in the construction of cells, leaving a balance of Rs. 9,043-11-0, spent in cash and book transfers in management and mainten- ance, or Rs. 418-9-6 less than in 1892. 36. There was a decrease of Rs. 302-13-1 on establishment, an increase of Rs. 272-8-11 on diet, due to the issue of a larger ghi ration during the cold weather months and to a more liberal use of milk for convalescents, a decrease of Rs. 386-5-2 on clothing and bedding, and a decrease of Rs. 151-10-6 on contingencies proper. 37. The abstract of the cash accounts, showing the cash expenditure under the different headings, is herewith given. The amounts expended on establishment and contingencies are still high, and. that on the latter is capable, I think, of further reduction, but the former must necessarily be higher than in other Asylums, owing to the irregular plan of the Lahore Asylum and to the small population in the Delhi one.

6 38. The only change in the establishment of the Lahore Asylum has been the substitution of a 1st grade Hospital Assistant in place of an Assistant Surgeon. 39. In Delhi the services of a cook, gardener, bhishti and harber have been dispensed with and their duties are now discharged by the inmates of the Asylum. 40. The Superintendents of both Asylums complain of the indifferent class of men employed as warders. The rate of pay being much lower than that given in jails, renders it impossible to secure the services of officient men. 41. Surgeon Major Coates reports very favourably on the satisfactory manner in which Lla Javand. Ll has discharged his duties as Drogah of the Asylum, and Surgeon Major Donnys writes in high terms of Hospital Assistant Gopl Ds, the Deputy Superintendent at Delhi, who takes an intelligent interest in his duties and has exercised a careful supervision over expenditure and all the departments of Asylum work. 42. The profits of the factory in the Lahore Asylum are shown in State- ment, No. XI to have been Rs. 914-11 -4, and in Delhi Rs.684-14-11. This statement differs from the one formerly in use, and the factory profits now appear in another form, but the results in Lahore are nearly the same as in 1892, while in Delhi an increase of Rs. 156-12-5 is shown. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, JAMES CLEGHORN, Inspr.-Genl. of Civil Hospitals, Punjab.

Proceeding of the Hon'ble the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in the Home (Medical and Sanitary) Department, No. 37 S., dated 27th May 1895. READ( 2 ) * Paragraph 27 of Report. The remark that " there is no market in Lahore for surplus stock"* is not understood. The demand for fresh vegetables in Lahore is believed to be great at all seasons of the year, and there should be no difficulty in disposing of any surplus garden produce at remunerative rates. 6. At the close of the year administrative sanction was given to certain improvements to the Lahore Lunatic Asylum buildings, estimated to cost (approximately) Rs. 20,899. These improvements are to embrace the construc- tion of two new hospitals, a new and safer barrack for criminal lunatics, and new roofs and means of ventilation for existing cells and barracks. It is hoped that these alterations will tend to remove the reproach which has for some years attached to the Lahore Asylum of insecurity and general unhealthiness. ORDER.No. 1110.

5 27. The profits of the factory in the Lahore Asylum are shown in Statement No. XI to have been Rs. 1,027-10-0, which is an improvement of Rs. 112-14-8 on 1893; and in Delhi Rs. 862-15-4, compared with Rs. 684-14-11 in 1893, an increase of Rs. 178-0-5. As requested by the Government of India, in letter No. 445, dated 26th July 1894, the attention of the Superintendent of the Lahore Asylum was drawn to the matter of the development of manufactures. That officer explains that manufactures have not been neglected, all the patients fit to work being kept employed. All the clothing that can be made by unskilled labourers is made up in the asylum, and all the gardening is done by the lunatics. With respect to garden produce, a larger number of lunatics have to be supplied with vegetables, and there is no market in Lahore for surplus stock. When there is such surplus stock, the lunatics get more than the sanctioned scale, but the excess price is not shown in the accounts. Of the sum of Rs. 1,915 spent on clothing and bedding in 1893, Rs. 1,208 was spent on raw material, Rs. 55 for the clothing of European and Eurasian lunatics, Rs. 417 for clothing and uniform of warders, and Rs. 235 for the labour of lunatics, so that raw material to the value of Rs. 1,208 was made up for the sum of Rs. 235. 28. The Superintendent of the Delhi Asylum draws particular attention to the impossibility of obtaining efficient warders at the present rates of pay, Rs. 5 to Rs. 8. Coolies of the worst character can only be procured for the lower rate. Their object is plunder, and the lunatics suffer. A proposal is now under consideration for raising the wages of these men. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, D. O'C. RAYE, Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab.
