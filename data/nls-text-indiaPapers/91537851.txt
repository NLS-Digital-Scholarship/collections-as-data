INTRODUCTION. IN accordance with the orders of the Government of India No. 28( 2 ) of humanized lymph or in the event of an outbreak of small-pox. The follow- ing table shows the division of Bengal into circles, the names of the officers who have been in charge of the circles during the triennial period under review, and the number of Deputy Superintendents, Inspectors, and Vaccinators employed under them. The total number of inspectors and vaccinators employed in muni- cipalities are also shown:( 3 ) but that there has been considerable fluctuation in every circle in the strength of the subordinate working establishment, the causes of which are as follows:( 4 ) Amount of recess work. 5. The following table shows the amount of recess work performed during the past three years :( 5 ) result. In secondary vaccination the rate of success reported in municipalities, viz., 64 per cent., is far too high to be true, and suggests either that many of the cases returned as secondary were actually primary, or that the rate of success was not truly recorded. The average rate of success in secondary vaccination in rural circles is reported to be about 34 per cent. This is probably correct. Comparative value of work per- formed by Government, Licensed and Municipal agency. 7. Of the work shown in the statement in the preceding paragraph, the following table shows how much was performed by the Government agency, how much by Licensed agency, and how much by Municipal agency : ( 6 ) The figures show that in each year males were protected to a greater extent than females. Vaccination according to religion. 9. The following table shows the total number of vaccinations according to class or religion and the proportion per cent. which the numbers vaccinated bear to the popula- tion of each class or nationality :[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]

Bengal.( 7 ) It would appear from these figures that the greatest number of successful primary operations are performed among persons between one year and under six years of age. The degree of protection afforded to infants under one year is not more than 15 per cent., which is quite inadequate. Further remarks on this subject will be found in paragraph 18. Cost of vaccination. 11. The following table shows the expenditure incurred during the past three years and the average cost of each successful operation:( 8 ) present principally confined to towns. But although inoculation has been prohibited by law in every district of Bengal except Mozufferpore, Durbhunga, and Sarun, which have not yet been taken up by the Vaccination Department, it is said to be still practised clandestinely in certain parts of the Darjeeling, Eastern Bengal, Behar, and Orissa Circles, more especially in the two latter, where unfortunately it is to some extent encouraged by wealthy bigoted Hindus. The Police and the Vaccination Department, however, systematically enquire into the prevalence of the practice and take the necessary steps to suppress it. As shown in the map, the Compulsory Vaccination Act is now in force, in every municipal town in Bengal except those mentioned in the margin, which are newly-created municipalities, and to which the Act will be extended as soon as possible. It has also been extended to the districts of Rungpur and portions of the Sonthal Pergunnahs, Tipperah, and Bhagulpore, where it was thought advisable to introduce it as an experimental measure, in order to overcome the strong resistance of the people of those districts to vaccination; but owing to the un- suitability of the Act in its present form to rural areas, it is practically a dead letter in the districts to which it has been extended.

Lymph( 9 ) appears that the whole of the spur will be required by the military authorities almost immediately for the construction of barracks for troops, the animal vaccination depôt cannot be established there. The only other suitable place for it in Darjeeling is a piece of land situated on Birch Hill belonging to His Highness the Maharajah of Burdwan, with whose agent I am in communication with a view to leasing the land. When the Darjeeling depôt is in working order, which I hope will be early next year, the supply of animal lymph from it and from the Calcutta depôt ought to be sufficient to enable the Bengal vaccine establishment to dispense with lymph obtained from the human subject. How vaccination was received generally. Present attitude and feeling of the people as regards vaccination. 15. Generally speaking, the present attitude of the people towards vaccin- ation is one of passive acceptance of the prophy- lactic. But in nearly every village there are families who habitually refuse vaccination either openly or by covertly hiding away their children from the vaccinators. What the villagers seem most to object to is having to pay for the operation and the using of some of their children as vaccinefers, this being attended by the discomfort of having to carry their children to the neighbouring village and other obvious discomforts. As the years go on some progress undoubtedly occurs in the popularizing of vaccination, as the people come to regard it as the Government dustur to have the operation performed, and to a certain extent they now seem to appreciate its benefits; but the protection of rural areas can never be placed on a proper footing until the Compulsory Vaccination Act in a suitably modified form be extended to them. The whole question is under the consideration of this Department, and a report on the subject will be submitted to Government in due course. By what class, according to religion, vaccination is best accept- ed and most resisted. 16. The Hindus who most resist vaccination are the higher and better-off classes, viz., Brahmins, Marwaries, Rajputs, and Beniahs. But in Lower Bengal these classes readily accept and appreciate the benefits of the measure. Among Musalmans the Ferazis give most trouble. Vaccination is most readily accepted by the lowest classes of the people, both Hindus and Mahomedans. Local aid. As a rule assistance, whenever applied for by the officers of the Vaccination Department, was willingly rendered by the local authorities( 10 ) Diagram showing the death-rate from SMALL-POX per 10,000 of population during the year 1887-88.

( 21 ) The Superintendent who has given the greatest satisfaction in the dis- charge of his duties is Dr. Waddell, Superintendent of Vaccination, Darjeeling Circle; and the Superintendent whose work has been most unsatisfactory, and with whom I have had most fault to find, is Apothecary P. Verriah Naidu of the Orissa Circle. Most of the Deputy Superintendents of Vaccination have worked well and inspected a fairly large number of villages and the vaccination operations per- formed in them, but the work of Moulvie Tajamul Hossein, of the Bhagulpore Division of the Darjeeling Circle, was exceptionally good, and calls for special remark. It is true that other Deputy Superintendents inspected a larger number of cases than he did, but his work was scattered over a much larger area than that of any other Deputy, and was consequently much more difficult to get at; and he had, besides, the difficult task of re-organizing the system of vaccination within the area of the late Sonthal Pergunnahs Circle, which was in a state of great confusion. Notwithstanding this difficulty and the time spent by him in stamping out outbreaks of small-pox in several unprotected areas of the late Sonthal Pergunnahs Circle, he still succeeded in inspecting during the last season the large amount of 24,510 cases from 1,054 villages. This exceptional number is partly owing to his having caused the vaccinators to work off arrears of vaccination, but is chiefly owing to his having been constantly on tour in the endeavour to see the work of every vaccinator in his new divisionSTATISTICAL RETURNS.

Dr. Gregg reports that the percentage of successful secondary operations in municipalities is much too high to be correct, and that either many cases returned as secondary were in fact primary, or that the rate of success was not truly recorded. The question of the accuracy of the reported rate of success was raised by the Government of India in Mr. Lyall's letter No. 327, dated 17th October 1889, in which comment was made on the small proportion of operations checked by inspecting officers. The following table shows, however, that during each of the three years under report the number of operations checked by supervising officers of one class or another has always exceeded 70 per cent. The Lieutenant-Governor attaches much importance to these inspections, and hopes that future years will show a larger percentage, especially on the part of Superintendents:( 3 ) 8. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to notice the excellent work done by Moulvie Tajamal Hossein, Deputy Superintendent of the Bhagulpore Division.

No. 4296. FROM SURGEON-MAJOR W. H. GREGG, Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Calcutta, the 15th July 1891. SIR, LAST year I submitted, in accordance with the orders of the Govern- ment of India, No. 28-1579(2 ) In 1889-90 the strength of the working establishment not including muni- cipalities was as follows:( 3 ) In districts gone over several times the paucity of children and the tender ages of those found had some influence in diminishing the numbers. The parents of such children are against early operations.&quot; Dr. Wood, the Superintendent of Vaccination in the Ranchi Circle, explains the decrease of 2,479 operations in his circle as follows:( 4 ) Amount of recess work.

The following table shows circle by circle and in municipalities separately the number of males and females vacci- nated during the year under report as compared with the previous year:( 6 ) Taking the province as a whole, it will be seen that there was a decrease during the year under report as compared with the previous year in the proportion of persons protected under all classes of religion except &quot; Other classes,&quot; under which there was a small increase. As usual the greatest degree of protection was afforded to Christians and the least to other classes. As usual also a larger percentage of Mahomedans than Hindus was protected. Vaccination according to age. 9. The following statement shows circle by circle and in municipalities separately the number of successful primary vaccinations according to age, and the proportion per cent. wihch the figures of each age period bear to the total number of persons vaccinated for the first time:( 7 ) It will be seen that in circles or rural areas, although the total cost of vaccination was more during the year under report than in the previous year, the average cost of each successful case was the same in both years, viz., one anna and five pies. In municipalities also the total cost of vaccination was greater, and so was the cost of each successful case. The general result was an increase of one pie in the cost of each successful case. The following is an explanation of the increase or decrease in the total expenditure in each circle. In the Calcutta Circle the increase of Rs. 1,295-5-9 is due (1) to the employment of seven extra vaccinators for two months during the small-pox epidemic and to contingencies ; (2) to the employment of a Eurasian female vaccinator on Rs. 40 a month in place of the native female vaccinator on Rs. 12 a month, hitherto employed ; and (3) to the grant of an increase of pay to the establishment consequent on the amalgamation of the Suburbs of Calcutta with the Town of Calcutta. In 1889-90 there was only a small extra expendi- ture on this account. The increase of Rs. 2,447-15-1 in the total cost of the Metropolitan Circle and of five pies in the cost of each successful case is said to be due to a falling off in the work and an increase on account of travelling allowance. The decrease of Rs. 316-8-1 in the total cost of the Darjiling Circle is due to further savings effected by the amalgamation of the Sonthal Pergunnahs Circle. The cause of the increase of Rs. 176-6-9 in the Ranchi Circle is due to the additional Inspectors appointed with the sanction of Government in that circle. The increase of Rs. 1,046-9-9 in the Eastern Bengal Circle is due to the additional supervising agency appointed with the sanction of Government about the middle of the working season. The decrease of Rs. 187-4-11 in the Orissa Circle is due principally to the abolition of the Government agency and the introduction of the licensed system of vaccination. The comparatively large increase of Rs. 5,000-6 in the Behar Circle is due to the increased supervising establishment employed with the sanction of Government, and also to the grant of full or working season's pay to the staff of Government vaccinators and Inspectors deputed to stamp out outbreaks of small-pox which occurred during the recess. In municipalities the cost of vaccination is borne from municipal funds supplemented by contributions from private sources. During the year under report, the following sums were contributed from private sources. For com- parison the sums contributed during the previous year are also shown :( 8 ) towns of the province with the exception of those noted in the margin, to which it should be extended at an early date. It has also been extended to the rural areas in the districts of Rungpur and portions of the Sonthal Pergunnahs, Tipperah and Bhagulpur, where, however, it is only nominally in force. Sonamukhi. Lohardugga. Nattore. Chyebassa. Cox's Bazar. Jhaldah. Kissenganj. Raghunathpur. Lymph. As usual the work of the year was started throughout the province in the month of September with bovine lymph supplied from the Animal Vaccination Depôt in Calcutta, supplemented by supplies from England and from the hills. The virus thus started is kept up by arm-to-arm vaccination, stored lymph in tubes being also employed. The use of crusts or scabs is prohibited. The demand for bovine lymph is fast increasing. When used direct from the calf it is invariably success- ful, but when supplied in tubes the experience of the year under report shows that it almost invariably failed. The Superintendent of the Metropolitan Circle, who is in charge of the Central Animal Vaccination Depôt , attributes this unsatisfactory result to the heat of the plains and to delay on the part of local officers in using the lymph ; but it has been brought to my notice that even when the lymph was used immediately on its receipt in the cold weather it failed( 9 ) Hindus, but the Ferasis give much trouble. In addition to the necessity for making vaccination compulsory in rural areas, it is desirable, if vaccination is to be put on a satisfactory footing, that something should be done to help the licensed vaccinators in realizing their fees when they have any difficulty in doing so themselves, which at present is the case in most districts, especially in those in which the Magistrates do not recognize the vaccinator's license as a legal document authorizing them (1) either to vaccinate or (2) to receive fees for their work. These matters are discussed and a remedy suggested in the note on the reorganization of the Sanitary and Vaccination Department which is at present under the consideration of Government, Local aid. As a general rule, assistance whenever applied for by the officers of the Vaccination Department was rendered by the local authorities in promoting by persuasion the cause of vaccination, but in the absence of a compulsory law such help was not found to be very material. Diagrams showing the death.- rate from small-pox and the pro- portion of the population protected against the disease of vaccina- tion. The following diagrams illustrate the death-rate from small-pox per 10,000 of the population in each district of the Province during the year under report, and the proportion of the population protected against the disease by vaccination during the seven years ending 1890-91. This period of time is taken, as it is the period during which the efficacy of vaccination is supposed to last.

( 11 ) Diagram showing the proportion of population protected per 10,000 during the seven years 1884( 12 ) It will be seen that the death-rate from small-pox was highest in those circles in which the degree of protection afforded to the population was least, viz., in the Metropolitan, Behar, and Orissa Circles. In Behar, vaccination has only recently been introduced, and two of the districts have not yet been taken up by the Vaccination Department, but there is no such excuse for the Metropolitan and Orissa Circles the administration of which is to blame. The small number of vaccinations performed in these circles is again attributed to paucity of subjects for operations, which is not a valid excuse, as will be seen from the following statement which shows in order of sequence the degree of protection afforded to infants available for vaccination in each district of the province during the year under report :( 13 ) Degree of supervision exercised by Superintendents and Deputy Superintendents of Vaccination. The following statements show the degree of supervision reported to have been exercised by Superintendents, Deputy Super- intendents and Inspectors of Vaccination during the year under report over the work of vaccinators :( 14 ) Compared with last year the proportion per cent. of operations inspected by each Deputy Superintendent is as follows:STATISTICAL RETURNS.

READ( 2 ) The Metropolitan and Eastern Bengal circles and the municipalities show a very- marked falling off, the numbers being 28,965, 70,110 and 14,265 respectively. The decrease of 8,782 or 33.4 per cent. in the town of Calcutta is attributed to the large number of operations (26,280) during the small-pox epidemic of the previous year having left fewer subjects to be operated on during the year under report. In the Eastern Bengal Circle, where the ratio of decrease reaches 18.0 per cent., and corresponds closely to the reduction shown in the number of operations, the Deputy Superintendent explains that in Chittagong the number of operations fell off by 103,507( 3 ) returns of villages visited and cases inspected really represent a careful examina- tion of the work done by the licensed or salaried vaccinators, and not merely a hurried compliance with an arbitrary departmental standard of supervision. 7. Some interesting results may be arrived at by comparing the regis- tered deaths from small-pox as shown for each district in Bengal in Statement V (b) with the diagram given on page 11, to illustrate the proportion of the population protected by vaccination during the last seven years. If the returns of successful vaccinations and the mortuary statistics were both accurate, it might be expected, as a general rule, that districts with the highest proportion of persons protected by vaccination would have the lowest death-rates from small- pox, and conversely that districts, where only a small proportion of the population is protected, would show a comparatively high small-pox mortality. Notwith- standing the admitted imperfection of both sets of figures, a distinct tendency towards some such correspondence between increased protection and reduced death-rate may be traced on the diagram referred to. The following districts returning a high vaccination rate show, with the single exception of Chittagong, a low death-rate from small-pox, thus( 4 ) for some time past, but considerable difficulty was found in obtaining a proper site. A suitable piece of land has at last been selected at the north base of Senchal. Steps are being taken to provide the necessary buildings, and it is hoped that the depôt will be got into working order during the current year. 10. In discussing the attitude of the people towards vaccination, the Sanitary Commissioner writes as if they had only now discovered that the operation is not compulsory in rural areas. He says that many members of the higher and wealthier Hindu castes habitually evade vaccination, and that every- where there is difficulty in realising the vaccinator's fees. As a remedy for the former difficulty, Dr. Gregg proposes to extend the compulsory clauses of the Vaccination Act to rural areas ; while he suggests that the latter might be got over by making a vaccinator's fees recoverable through the village panchayat like the chowkidari tax. Neither suggestion seems to the Lieutenant-Governor to be practicable nor desirable. The whole question of the organisation of the Vaccination Department is now under consideration, and Sir Charles Elliott would rather remodel it on a district or divisional basis, so as to extend the duties of the Civil Surgeon, than resort to compulsory provisions without adequate machinery to enforce them.

No. 5605 FROM SURGEON LIEUT.-COLONEL W. H. GREGG-, M.B., Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Calcutta, the 27th August 1892. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the following annual statistics and brief notes on vaccination in Bengal for the year 1891-92. 2. I was in charge of the Department throughout the year, and had the following staff to work with:( 2 ) There was thus an increase of four Inspectors, a decrease of 22 Government or paid vaccinators and two apprentices, and an increase of 10 licensed vaccinators and 102 apprentices during the year under report. Number of operations performed and average per man. 3. The following table shows, circle by circle and in municipalities separately, the total number of operations performed during the year under report (1891-92) as compared with the previous year (1890-91) by the establishment of vaccinators shown in the last columns of the statement in paragraph 2 (which for facility of reference is reproduced here) and the average number of operations performed by each vaccinator:( 3 ) Bihâr Circle.( 4 ) Comparative value of work per- formed by Government, Licensed and Municipal Agency. 6. The following statement shows the comparative value of the work performed by Government, licensed and municipal agency during the year under report as compared with the previous year:( 5 ) Vaccination according to class or religion. 8. The following table shows, circle by circles and in municipalities, the number of vaccinations performed according to class or religion, and the proportion per cent. which the number bear to the population of each class or nationality:( 6 ) Cost of vaccination. 10. The following' statement shows, circle by circle and in municipalities, the expenditure incurred on account of vaccination and the average cost of each successful case during the year under report as compared with the previous year :( 7 ) The following table shows the sums so contributed during the year under report, together with similar information for the previous year: ( 8 ) Diagram showing the death-rates from SMALL-POX per 10,000 of population during the year 1891-92.

( 9 ) Diagram showing the proportion of population protected during the seven years 1885( 10 ) In my Annual Vaccination Report for 1891, under the heading small-pox, I have dilated on the excessive prevalence of small-pox in some districts com- pared with others. I have nothing to add to those remarks, which apply here. Protection afforded to infants. 12. The following statement shows in order of sequence the degree of protection afforded to infants in each district of the province during the year under report: ( 11 ) Department for the first time) paid vaccinators operated: in the rest of the province licensed vaccinators were at work. The general plan of work was for the individual vaccinator to take up as fully as possible that portion of his area left over from the previous year, so that the vaccination of each area might, in this way, be more or less completed every two years. Difficulty in extending vaccina- tion. 14. Increased difficulties were felt during the year under report in extending vaccination owing to a growing feeling of opposition among the people, as they learnt that they were not bound by law to accept it, and a reluctance to pay the vaccinator's fees. As a remedy for these evils I advocated the extension of compulsory vaccination to rural areas throughout Bengal, and the passing of a special enactment enabling vaccinators' fees to be recovered if there was no law existing under which this could be done. The Government of Bengal, however, considered that the true solution of the difficulty was to be found in a thorough reorganization of the Vaccination Department on the decentralization principle, which has been carried out since the close of the year under review. Reorganization of the Vacci- nation Department. 15. Under the old scheme Bengal was divided for vaccination purposes into six circles, each being in charge of a Superin- tendent of Vaccination, who was also Deputy Sanitary Commissioner. Three of the Superin- tendents were Covenanted Medical Officers, two were Assistant Surgeons, and one was an Apothecary of the Subordinate Medical Department. They were assisted in the work of inspection by thirteen Deputy Superintendents of Vacci- nation, eleven of whom were Assistant Surgeons, while two had undergone no regular medical training. Under the Deputy Superintendents, again, were 116 Inspectors of Vaccination, whose pay for the most part varied from Rs. 20 to Rs. 50, while a few got Rs. 15 or Rs. 16 a month. Under the new scheme all the Deputy Superintendents and three of the six Superintendents or Deputy Sanitary Commissioners have been abolished, and the executive supervision of the work of vaccination has been transferred to Civil Surgeons, who for this purpose are in future to be ex-officio Superintendents of Vaccination in their respective districts, acting under the orders of, and standing in the same relation as the former Superintendent of Vaccination to, the Sanitary Commissioner, who continues to be the head of the department. Each Civil Surgeon under the new scheme has been allowed a District Inspector, whose pay ranges according to grade from Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 a month, with a fixed travelling allowance of Rs. 10 and as many Sub-Inspectors on Rs. 25 a month as there are subdivisions in the district to help him in supervising the work of vaccination. The three Deputy Sanitary Commissioners who have been retained under the new scheme are also to assist in the work of vaccina- tion, their duties being so arranged as not to conflict with those of the Civil Surgeons. Three revenue divisions have been allotted to each Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, who is to inspect thoroughly at least one division a year in addition to his regular sanitary duties, which have also been increased. Lymph. 16. As usual, vaccination was principally carried on during the year under report by means of human lymph. Operations were started with bovine lymph supplied from the Animal Vaccination Depôt in Calcutta, after which the virus was kept up by arm-to- arm vaccination, supplemented from time to time with stored lymph in tubes. Animal Vaccination Depôt at Calcutta. 17. Since the submission of my last annual vaccination report a great change for the better has taken place in the work- ing of the Central Animal Vaccination Depôt in Calcutta, from which good and reliable lymph is now turned out in large quantities. The improved method of extraction and preservation is based on the suggestions contained in the pamphlet on the subject by the late Surgeon-Major A. Barclay and the recommendations of Dr. King of the Madras Sanitary Department, and was carried out under my personal directions by Assistant Surgeon Umesh Chunder Ghose, one of the Deputy Superintendents of Vaccination attached to the Metropolitan Circle, to whom credit is due for the able manner in which he carried out instructions. In addition to pure calf lymph, which was always successful when used within 24 hours after extraction, glycerised and lanoline lymph were prepared in the
( 12 ) depôt , and issued to a large number of persons for experimental purposes. Glycerised lymph was not as a rule successful, but lanoline lymph was decidedly so. Glycerised lymph seems unsuitable to India for the following reasons:( 13 ) Civil Medical Officer, Saidpur. Railway Native Doctor, Sahibganj. Assistant Surgeon, Gaibandha.

Lymph was stored and prepared for experimental purposes in the following forms :( 14 ) With the exception, however, of Ranchi, Hazáribágh, Noakhali, and Tippera, he met of the other districts unvisited most of the Inspectors and several selected vaccinators, so that only the above-noted four districts remained uninstructed. The officers met and instructed were( 15 ) This record of work compares as follows with the proportion of operations inspected by Superintendents in the previous year 1890-91:( 16 ) It will be seen that there is a decrease in almost every case, which is very unsatisfactory.

DARJEELING, THE 20TH SEPTEMBER 1892. RESOLUTION( 2 ) largest decrease occurred in the Darjeeling and the Eastern Bengal Circles, where it amounted to 72,791 and 53,343 operations respectively. Against this general falling off in the Vaccination circles, it. is satisfactory to notice an increase of 5,189 in the total number of operations performed by Municipal vaccinators and at dispensaries in the mufassal. There appears to be no reason why every medical officer in charge of a dispensary in the mufassal should not perform vaccinations in the town in which his dispensary is situated, provided this does not interfere with his proper work at the dispensary. The Sanitary Commissioner is requested to consult with the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals with a view to carrying out this suggestion. Explanation of decrease. Year.

As regards the various explanations given for this general falling off,it is difficult to know what weight to attach to them without precise local knowledge of the facts. In Calcutta the decrease is attributed by Dr. Simpson to the prevalence of small-pox during the previous year, when many people resorted to vaccination. The figures for Calcutta quoted in the margin would appear primâ facie to support this explanation, but on the other hand it isnot borne out by the figures for the province at large.. While the number of deaths* from small- pox was greater in 1890-91 than in 1889-90, and in 1891 92 almost double the number in 1889-90, the number of operations in 1891-92 was much less than in either 1890-91 or 1889-90. In the Metropolitan, Darjeeling, and Eastern Bengal Circles the decrease is ascribed among other causes to the prevalence of malarious fever and to the unusual unhealthiness of the year, and also to the inability of the people to pay the vaccinators' fees owing to poverty. There is a rule that except in seasons of epidemic only healthy persons should be vaccinated, but it is paying a great compliment to the discretion of the vacci- nator to suppose that they would abstain from operating on children whose parents present them for vaccination, on the ground that they are in a bad state of health. Looking to the fact that in Eastern Bengal at least the season was a prosperous one, the Lieutenant-Governor doubts very much whether the alleged inability of the people to pay the vaccinator's fee of two annas is an explanation which will bear scrutiny. Average work of each operator. 5. Each paid vaccinator performed on an average 922 operations against1,267 in the previous year, each licensed vaccinator 608 against 694, and each Municipal vaccinator 355 against 346. These results are unsatisfactory, and no valid reasons have been given for the falling off. Statement IV of the Statistical Returns illustrates how the work of vaccination has been gradually transferred between the years 1882-83 and 1891-92 from the hands of Government operators to licensed agency. In 1882-83, when the comparative value of work performed by the licensed agency was considered superior to that performed by Government agency, the average number of operations performed per man was 1,035 by the licensed class and 1,026 by the Government vaccinators. The figures for 1891-92 show a great decrease in the outturn of work done by each licensed vaccinator, the reasons for which are not apparent. The table in paragraph 7 of the report showing vaccination by sex is of little use unless some practical conclusion can be drawn from it. The Lieutenant-Governor is disposed to doubt whether any such conclusion can be drawn, and it would probably be sufficient, instead of preparing an elaborate table, to state that the number of males vaccinated exceeded the number of females, being 51.6 as against 48.4. Much the same may be said of the table in paragraph 8 illustrating vaccination according to class or religion. Here again totals for the province would be sufficient, and separate figures need not be given for vaccination circles and municipalities. Cost of vaccination. 6. This transfer of work to the licensed agency has not, however,.resulted in any saving of cost to Government, as,.whenever the licensed system has been introduced into any circle, the savings have been utilised in strengthening the inspecting staff. The total cost to Government in 1891-92 was Rs. 1,47,542, against Rs. 1,16,084 in 1882-83, the average cost of each reported successful vaccination being 1 anna and 8 pies against 1 anna and 5¾ pies in 1882-83. The total expenditure on
( 3 ) vaccination from all sources was Rs. 1,79,842 in 1891-92, against Rs. 1,82,400 in the previous year, the decrease being mainly due to the transfer of the cove- nanted Superintendent of the Metropolitan Circle to the Medical Department and the appointment in his place of an Assistant Surgeon on less pay. The Municipal expenditure on vaccination shows a slight increase, while the cost to District Funds was merely nominal. Protection afforded. 7. Protection was afforded to 292,438 infants under one year of ageagainst 290,819 in the previous year, showing an average percentage of only 11.81 under protection.This is far from satisfactory, and every effort should be made to extend further protection to children in early ages of life. The highest percentages were attained in Darjeeling (57.44), Lohardaga (51.12), Political States (42.04), Malda (32.03), and Sonthal Parganas (24.1); and the lowest in Gaya (2.97), Cuttack (2.59), and Backergunge (2.37). The table of vaccination according to age given in paragraph 9 has not been made to yield any practical conclusion, and its utility seems doubtful. The District of Muzaffarpur was for the first time taken up by the depart- ment, and 4 per cent. of the population are shewn to have been vaccinated during the year. Since the close of the year arrangements have been made for the introduction of vaccination into Darbhanga, the only unprotected district in the province. 8. The value of the figures given in the preceding paragraph, about pro- tection, rests to a large degree on the proportion of successful operations reported by the vaccinators, while in the case of primary vaccination is returned as 99.21 against 99.21 in the previous year. This ratio is quite incredible, and nothing is said in the Report to show how far the supervising officers set themselves to the examination of these returns, and what the results were of their inspections. Supervision. 9. The following table shows the number of operations inspected during the year 1891-92 and the previous year:( 4 ) to 20,417, against 14,061 in the previous year, the following districts having suffered the most:( 5 ) than the ordinary lancet. In Dr. Gregg's opinion, however, the one instrument is in fact as suitable as the other, and until a more definite opinion can be arrived at as to the superiority of either instrument, the Lieutenant-Governor would leave it to Civil Surgeons to choose for themselves with which they will perform their operations. Reorganization of the Vaccina- tion Department. 14. As was noticed in the closing paragraph of the Resolution on lastyears returns, Dr. Gregg's proposal to extend the compulsory clauses of the Vaccination Act to rural areas, with a view to check the growing feeling of opposition to vaccination among the people, did not commend itself to the Lieutenant-Governor in the absence of adequate machinery to enforce those provisions, and the remedy was sought for in a reorganization of the department. This question engaged the attention of Government during the year under review, and since the close of the year material changes have been introduced with the sanction of the Government of India. Under the old system, the Superintendent of Vaccination had an inconveniently large area to deal with, which rendered it impossible for him to work in effective concert with the District Magistrate; and much of the opposition with which vaccination was received was attributed to its being cut off from the district administrative, and left to fight its way unaided by the influence which a District Officer may judiciously exercise in matters like this, as experience had shewn that, in the few instances in which vaccination officers have been able to work in concert with the district executive, satisfactory results were obtained. The chief feature of the changes introduced is the transfer of the executive supervision and control of the work of vaccination to Civil Sur- geons, who are for this purpose ex-officio Superintendents of Vaccination in their respective districts, and who have been allowed a sufficient establishment, recruited in great measure from the existing staff, to carry on the work. Of the six Superintendents of Vaccination hitherto employed in the Department, the services of three have been retained as supervising officers under the re-organized scheme. The jurisdiction of each of the three Deputy Sanitary Commissioners will comprise three of the nine revenue divisions of the province; and among other duties these officers will be required to inspect and report on vaccina- tion operations in specified areas of districts to be selected in the beginning of each year in communication with the Civil Surgeons concerned. The Lieuten- ant-Governor will expect Dr. Gregg to report fully on the working of the scheme in next year's report. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, H. H.

Officer in charge of the Depart- ment. SURGEON-LIEUTENANT-COLONEL W. H. GREGG, who is at present on sick leave,was in charge of the Vaccination Department throughout the triennial period under report. Surgeon-Captain H. J. Dyson, Officiating Sanitary- Commissioner, Bengal, is the officer who submits this report. Delay in the submission of the Report. 2. The report was due to Government on the 15th June, but owing to thedifficulty and delay experienced in getting together the district returns under the re-organization scheme from Civil Surgeons and the new officers of the Department, who had never dealt with such returns before, and the having in consequence to send them backwards and forwards for correction and recorrec- tion, it has been found impossible, in spite of my best endeavours, to submit this report earlier. Even now I am obliged to do so without the figures of the Tributary States of Orissa which have not yet been received. The new scheme, however, is now in working order, the new departmental officers have had experience of what is required, and delay in the submission of the annual report ought not again to occur. Change in the administration of Vaccination. 3. During the year 1892-93 a radical change was effected, under theorders of Government, in the working of the Vac- cination Department in Bengal, the chief feature of which was the transfer of the executive supervision and control of the work to Civil Surgeons, who are now for this purpose Superin- tendents of Vaccination. Under the old scheme, Civil Surgeons had nothing to do with vaccination beyond the limits of the towns in which they were stationed. The Province was divided into six circles, each under the supervision of a Superintendent of Vaccination who was also Deputy Sanitary Commissioner. Three of these Superintendents were covenanted officers of the Indian Medical Service, two were Assistant Surgeons, and one was an Apothecary. They were assisted in the work of inspection by thirteen Deputy Superintendents of Vaccination, eleven of whom were Assistant Surgeons and two were non-medi- cal men. Under the Deputy Superintendents of Vaccination, again, were 116 In- spectors, whose pay varied from Rs. 15 to Rs. 50 a month. This constituted the supervising staff. The operating staff was composed of 101 Government vaccinators (including 9 apprentices), who were employed to initiate vaccina- tion, 297 Municipal vaccinators, and 2,340 licensed vaccinators (including 696 apprentices). The chief defect of the old scheme was the inconveniently large area with which the Superintendents of Vaccination had to deal, which rendered it impossible for them to exercise sufficient supervision, or to work in effective B
( 2 ) concert with the District Magistrate, and much of the opposition with which vaccination was received was attributed to its being thus cut off from the district administration and left to fight its way unaided by the influence which a district officer can judiciously exercise in a matter like this. Under the new scheme the area of supervision has been reduced to the reasonable and practicable limits of a district, and the Civil Surgeon is held responsible for its protection against small-pox. He is allowed a district Inspector on a salary ranging from Rs. 80 to Rs. 40 a month, according to grade, and a Sub-Inspector on Rs. 25 a month for each subdivision, and he uses his discretion as to the number of licensed and municipal vaccinators it is necessary to employ. All the Deputy Superinten- dents of Vaccination and the three uncovenanted Superintendents under the old scheme have been abolished, the three covenanted officers being retained as Deputy Sanitary Commissioners, and also to assist Civil Surgeons in inspecting vaccination in the remote portions of their districts, which, on account of their numerous duties at head-quarters, they are not able to get at. The idea is excellent, but the number of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners is inadequate thoroughly to inspect vaccination in outlying rural areas where supervision is most required. It has been found impracticable for Civil Surgeons to do much more than the little inspection that is possible in connection with their quarterly inspection of dispensaries, which means going over the same ground again and again, and owing to the enormous jurisdiction of the Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioners (Metropolitan Circle 13 districts, Northern Bengal Circle 19 districts, and Western Bengal Circle 14 districts, and the Tributary States of Orissa and Chota Nagpur) and their other duties in connection with the sanitary inspection of minor towns, it is not possible for them to visit a district for thorough vaccination inspection more than once in three years: the result is that vacci- nation in outlying tracts is practically left to the unchecked supervision of the subordinate inspecting staff, who may or may not be performing their duties honestly, though they may be regularly sending in satisfactory returns of work. This is the defect of an otherwise admirable scheme. Strength of the working staff. 4. The strength of the local supervising and working staff during eachof the three years under report is exhibited in the following statement:( 3 ) years under report; the average of the preceding three years is also shown for purposes of comparison :( 4 ) the unprotected infants of previous years and a large proportion of the adult population to be revaccinated, so that there was in fact no dearth of subjects:( 5 ) The average of the three years 1890-93 in provincial rural areas and mufassal municipalities is much greater than the average of the three years 1887-90. This is partly due to the wholesale revaccination now of localities in which the slightest outbreak of small-pox occurs during the hot weather, and partly to some municipalities now carrying on vaccination all the year round. Primary vaccinations and revac- cinations separately. 7. The following statements show, district by district and in municipali- ties separately, the total number of primary vac- cinations and revaccinations performed in the Province during each of the three years underreport, the average of the three years, and the average of the previous threeyears:( 6 ) Revaccinations.

The following statement compares the work done by licensed vac- cinators, Government vaccinators, and municipal vaccinators during each of the three years under report, the average of these years, and the average of the preceding three years:(7) It will be seen that there were more licensed vaccinators during the three years under report than in the previous three years; consequently there were more operations; but why, it may be asked, was the average number of operations per man less ? Because a larger number of apprentices are now employed. They cannot work as quickly as the regular men, and the total of the two is taken into consideration in calculating the average per man. As regards the Government agency, fewer men of course did less work, and the average per man was reduced in consequence of the seven vaccinators in the Chittagong Hill Tracts not being able to perform more than an average of 62 operations each, on account of the strong opposition in those parts, where vaccination was introduced for the first time during the year 1892-93. Not- withstanding this, it will be observed that each Government vaccinator does nearly double the amount of work of a licensed vaccinator and three times the work of a municipal vaccinator. This is not because he is more energetic than licensed and municipal vaccinators, but because he vaccinates free of charge in new areas where there is no difficulty in getting subjects. The reduced average per municipal vaccinator is due to some operations in towns being now performed by the Civil Surgeon himself, Assistant Surgeons and other medical officers, and to the total of all these agencies being taken into account in striking an average per man. The smaller average of each municipal vacci- nator is also due to fewer operations being performed in Calcutta on account, it is alleged, of paucity of subjects. Vaccination according to sex, class and age. 9. The following table shows the average result of vaccination, accordingto sex, class and age, during the triennial period under report (1890-93) as contrasted with the pre- vious three years, 1887-90:( 8 ) Cost of vaccination and contri- butions from local sources. 10.

In connection with the prevalence of small-pox in the town anddistrict of Dacca during the year 1892-93, some remarkable results of vaccination were brought to light in connection with the protection of the pri- soners in the Dacca jail, which the Government asked me specially to notice and explain in the Annual Vaccination Report. It appears that 3,465 prisoners were vaccinated in the jail during the year in question. Of these( 14 ) The case of the Dacca jail prisoners who had recently suffered from small-pox being successfully vaccinated also at first sight appears to invalidate the performance of vaccine operations, but this is not the case; for if one attack of small-pox does not necessarily confer immunity against another attack, it may reasonably be assumed that one attack of small-pox need not necessarily protect against subsequent successful vaccination. Dr. Edwardes, page 10, mentions that &quot;Dr. Koch told the Commission (German) that he him- self had seen a patient in a third attack of small-pox which proved fatal;&quot; also Professor Wundulich asserts that he saw one patient have two attacks in the same epidemic. It will thus be seen that a survived attack of small-pox does not absolutely confer immunity against another attack, but such cases are very uncommon. As regards the Dacca prisoners, Dr. Cobb informed me personally that three of the six were attacked very mildly, that only one had a severe attack, and that all were vaccinated in two spots only. Regarding the apparent failure of inoculation in affording protection, it must be borne in mind that successful inoculation is only vaccination with a lymph whose strength is not attenuated. If after inoculation, as not unfrequent- ly happens, the child suffers from a general eruption, the parents return the case as one of pure small-pox only; if the child does not show a general eruption, it is held to be successfully inoculated. That is to say, one of two things usually results from inoculation( 15 ) lymph is naturally repugnant to high-caste Hindus, who will not, in many instances on any consideration, allow their children to be used as vaccinifers.(2) The sufferings of human vaccinifers are obvious.(3) The objection to the use of human vaccinifers on account of the possi-ble risk of spreading infectious or hereditary disease. This risk is not as great as it is thought to be, but it is one of the most powerful arguments brought forward in the phillipics of rabid anti-vaccinators. I have already addressed the Government on this subject, and suggested, for the above reasons, that vaccination be performed in future with bovine lymph only. It is, however, impossible to supply the necessary quantity in tubes from the central depôts at Calcutta and Darjeeling, and it has been calculated that to establish the nine more depôts that would be required of the approximate power of the Calcutta depôt would cost about Rs. 1,02,500 per annum, which at once puts the idea of a depôt supply out of the question. The solution of the diffi- culty, however, as I have pointed out in the separate communication referred to, lies in the adoption in Bengal of the Punjab and Central Provinces system of local calf (buffalo or cow) vaccination, i.e., of vaccinating the people direct from their own calves in their own villages. The system is- very simple. A calf is procured through the village headman (as a rule for nothing, though from 8 annas to one rupee per calf may sometimes have to be paid) and is in- oculated with lanoline lymph, obtained from one of the depôts, on its abdomen, which must of course be first washed with soap and water, and then shaved by the vaccinator. From this calf all the village children are vaccinated, as well as a calf from each of the neighbouring villages, which are brought in for the purpose and returned to their owners immediately after inocula- tion. When the lymph is ripe on these calves, which is usually on the sixth day after inoculation, the vaccinators proceed to the villages and vac- cinate from the calves all the children of those villages, as well as fresh calves from other villages. In this way animal vaccination is spread throughout the district, and the evils of arm-to-arm vaccination are avoided. No harm is done to the calf, which requires no particular care during the period the lymph Is ripening on it. Although there seems to be no prejudice in Bengal to the use of bovine lymph prepared in the central depôts, there may at first be some opposition on the part of the Hindus to seeing their sacred animal, as they may suppose, tortured for the supply of the required lymph. But the experience elsewhere shows that when they actually see that the operation causes no pain, and when after a little experience they come to realize the great advantages of animal over human lymph, they will readily aid the proposed system. The Government have sanctioned its introduction experimentally during the approaching cold weather in a dozen districts, which I am now engaged in selecting for the approval of Government. I am also having experiments con- ducted in goat and sheep vaccination which it has occurred to me might be substituted for calf vaccination. If the results are successful, as they so far promise to be, all difficulty on account of religious prejudices will be removed, and we will have a system of vaccination at once cheap and popular among all castes, and thus eminently suitable for India. I will submit a special report to Government on this subject in due course. Animal Vaccination Depôts. 15. There are, as stated in the previous paragraph, two animal vaccinedepôts in the province( 16) vaccination should be vigorously encouraged, with the view of doing away with human lymph altogether.The objects of both depôts are( 17 ) suggested that they (the District Board) should pay the cost of vaccinators and contingencies. They promised to consider the matter, and I have just received a telegram from Dr. Banks, the Civil Surgeon, informing me that they have provided Rs. 850 for free vaccination during the approaching season. This is very encouraging, and I have no doubt that if the matter were properly explained to other District Boards, they would follow the good example of Puri. Local aid. 17. As a rule local aid, whenever applied for by Civil Surgeons and thesubordinate officers of the Vaccination Department, is willingly rendered by the local authorities, viz., Magistrates, Subdivisional Officers and the Police; but with no legal power it is very difficult, and in some instances it has proved impossible, for them to do anything. As Magistrates rightly observe, vaccination is not compulsory in rural areas, and there is no law under which vaccination fees are recoverable. How, then, are they to force the people either to accept vaccination or to pay up the vaccinator's fees when persuasion fails ? Difficulty in realizing fees. 18. This has become a most serious matter, and is undermining the wholesystem of licensed vaccination in Bengal. In the district of Tippera alone the unrecovered, and apparently unrecoverable, fees of the season 1892-93 amounts to over Rs. 600 !I am in communication with the Magistrate on the subject; but, judging from the correspondence which has taken place, I do not think it will be possible to recover much, if anything. In almost every district there are unrecover- able vaccination fees, which is very discouraging to the licensed vaccinators, and tends to their overcharging unsuspecting individuals, and operating only on those who can and will pay. For instance, in Krishnagar, which I recently inspected, I found a large number of indigent mehters, who had never been vaccinated. If the system of licensed vaccination is to continue, it is impera- tively necessary that something should be done to meet this difficulty. Dr. Gregg, the Sanitary Commissioner, has already written so much on the sub- ject, both in connection with the reorganization scheme and in every annual report on the working of the Department, that it is not necessary for me to say more here except perhaps to draw attention again to the fact that it is not worth the vaccinator's while to institute proceedings in a Civil Court for the sake of2 annas in each case. The people know this and take advantage of the knowledge. The vaccinators, on the other hand, get disheartened, and either strike work, as they have actually done in many parts of Orissa, or work in the unsatisfactory manner explained. The result is that the general work of the Department suffers, and vaccination gets a bad name. Unlicensed vaccination. 19. This growing practice is also doing incalculable harm to the causeof vaccination, and I would again earnestly recom- mend the Government to put a stop to it by legal enactment. It may be argued, as I believe it has been argued, that, as far as the general public is concerned, the practice of unlicensed vaccination can do no harm beyond engendering a false sense of security. But it does more than this. It creates a feeling of discontent and insubordination among regular licensed vaccinators, and is generally prejudicial to the interests of the Depart- ment. Why should a man, it is argued( 18 ) severe ulcers are frequently produced at the points of inoculation; at the same time the amount of protection against small-pox is extremely slight. Another very grave evil in connection with unlicensed vaccination is that in large num- bers of cases, in compliance with the requests of the mothers, the children are vaccinated in two spots only. This method of vaccination affords very slight protection, and in consequence, if subsequently the child is attacked by small- pox, the parents naturally regard vaccination as a very inferior prophylactic. There is a consensus of opinion among Civil Surgeons that unlicensed vacci- nation is dangerous, and should, in the interests of the Vaccination Department and the people alike, be prohibited by law just as inoculation is prohibited. Inspections of( 19 ) Civil Surgeons ( 20 ) Civil Surgeons of Burdwan and Howrah doing so little. As for the Civil Sur- geons of other districts who have time at their disposal for inspections in the interior, the statement shows clearly which of them took an interest in vaccination work and which of them did not. I would specially mention Drs. Nicholson, Bovill, Russell, Tomes, Cobb, Whitwell, Moorhead, Rogers, Granger, O'Gorman, Blaker and Banks as having worked very hard to promote vaccination in their districts.

( 21 ) The number of villages visited and the proportion of operations inspected by Inspectors of Vaccination are ridiculously inadequate; but as 1892-93 was the first year of the new scheme, I do not intend to take serious notice of the short inspections. The attention of all Civil Surgeons will, however, be drawn to the matter, and they will be asked to insist on Inspectors seeing at least 50 per cent. of the operations performed in the district. The same remarks apply to Sub-Inspectors in the table below. They should be made to inspect at least 80 per cent. of the operations performed in their jurisdiction :( 22 ) detailed working of the scheme has been entirely prompted by him, in the lucid circulars issued from bead-quarters to the local officers. Dr. Gregg, the permanent Sanitary Commissioner, mentioned in the Annual Sanitary Report that Mr. Price was an invaluable help to the Department, and remarked that he had shown powers of organization for which there was not sufficient scope in the position he occupies. I fully endorse this opinion, and hope the Government will soon have an opportunity of recognizing his services. If ever an officer deserved a better appointment, he does. H. J.

READ( 2 ) been performed during the year may be fairly ascribed, in some measure at least, to the effect of the new scheme, the success or failure of which appears to depend largely on the energy or apathy of the Civil Surgeon of the district. Strength of the establishment. 4. The strength of the supervising and operating staff during each of thethree years under review is exhibited in the follow- ing statement:( 3 ) vaccinated. The Darjeeling and Lohardaga districts head the list with 544.73 and 528.1 successful operations respectively, out of every thousand of the available infant population. Malda follows far behind with 397.76 per mille. At the bottom of the list we find Puri, Cuttack and the Chittagong Hill Tracts, with less than 10 per mille. The Officiating Sanitary Commissioner says in regard to those districts in which a falling off in the number of operations has occurred :&quot; Generally speaking, it is to be ascribed to neglect or indifference on the part of the supervising officers. At all events, the excuse that is very generally made of paucity of subjects, in consequence of previous activity, cannot be accepted, for * * * * with the exception of Darjeel- ling, the Sonthal Parganas, Dacca, Nadia, Faridpur, and Tippera, in no district did the total number of vaccinations come up to the estimated number of infants available for vaccination.&quot; A further consideration of the figures gives ground for more general deductions, for it is clear that in districts inhabited by non-Aryan people the objection to vaccination is not strong, for with the exception of Malda the whole of the first eight districts answer to this description, while the well-known hostility of the Uriyas to vaccination is demonstrated by the fact that with the exception of Balasore all the districts of this Division, which are almost entirely Hindu, are quite at the bottom of the list. 7. In regard to the number of vaccinations per mille of total population during 1892-93, Bengal is far behind the other provinces of Upper India, for while the provincial average of Bengal is 25.14 per mille, the figures for the Punjab are 39.7, for Assam 39.18, and for the Central Provinces 36.49, the North-Western Provinces lagging behind with 23.79. The provincial reports, with the exception of that from the Central Provinces, do not afford statistics for a calculation of this kind in regard to the proportion of successful vaccina- tions per mille of infant population; but in the Central Provinces the ratio is more than six times as high as in Bengal, being 790.25 per mille as against 125.49. Work of the vaccinators. 8. During the three years under review each paid vaccinator performedon an average 1,302 operations a year, and each licensed vaccinator 637, as compared with 1,578 and 671 respectively during the previous triennial period. The reason for the falling off in the average work of licensed vaccinators is said to be that there are now a larger number of apprentices employed, who, not being able to work as quickly as the more experienced men, reduce the general average. This may partially explain the fact, but there must be some further cause; for an examin- ation of the figures shows that, even if the same number of apprentices had been employed in the earlier as in the later period, the number of opera- tions remaining the same, the average work of each operator would still have been greater in the first triennial period. Dr. Dyson suggests, with some show of reason, that the difference between the average number of operations per- formed by a Government vaccinator and by a licensed vaccinator is due to the fact that the former operates free of charge in new areas where there is no difficulty in getting subjects, and there is no doubt that the fee of 2 annas charged by the licensed vaccinator is strongly resented by most of those from whom it is demanded, since they consider it the insult of spoliation added to the injury of unnecessary pain. 9. During the year 1892-93 an average of 1,172 operations was per- formed by each paid vaccinator, which is 130 less than the triennial average. The falling off is partially explained by the fact that the seven vaccinators appointed for the Chitagong Hills Tracts, which were only brought under the control of the Sanitary Commissioner in February 1893, were unable, owing to the strong opposition they experienced, to attain to a higher average than 62 operations each. The average during the same year for each licensed vaccinator was about half, viz., 615. 10. These figures compare very unfavourably with the statistics for other provinces, for whereas in Bengal in 1892-93 the number of operations performed by each vaccinator of whatever class averaged only 632, the figures elsewhere were as follows:( 4 ) and lead to the inference that the outturn of work tends to be in inverse ratio to the relative number of operators.

The average cost of each successful operation during the three yearsamounted to 1 anna 6 pies, which apparently compares well with the cost in the other Provinces in India, as shown in the margin; but it is to be feared that the comparison is illusory, since a large number of the vaccinators in Bengal, viz., no less than 1,756 out of 3,039, are licensed vaccinators, who are paid by fees taken from the people, while 878 others were unpaid apprentices, whose operations swell the total without any cost to the State: apprentices seem to be unknown in other provinces. Comparison between the death- rate from small-pox in each district and the proportion of protection. 12. Four diagrams are given in the report to illustrate the death-rate fromsmall pox in each district as compared with the proportion of the population protected by vaccina- tion during the last seven years. They lead to no very convincing deductions, probably because the phenomena recorded do not extend over a sufficiently long period. Puri and Cuttack, which in each year are well in the forefront of the list showing deaths from small-pox, are re- spectively eleventh and eighth from the bottom as regards protection : in these districts, however, all statistics are obscured by the annual concourse of pilgrims at Puri. Darjeeling, on the other hand, which is best protected, in no year shows a death-rate of more than 13 per mille of the population. It would be advisable in future to show the proportion of protection and the number of deaths from small-pox in one and the same diagram. In the present instance, moreover, the usefulness of the diagrams is much impaired by the fact that the districts are not shown in the same order in each. Vaccination operations in Dacca Jail. 13. The Officiating Sanitary Commissioner, as requested by Government,comments at some length on the result of certain vaccination operations in Dacca Jail. It appears that 3,465 prisoners were vaccinated, of whom 1,667 had been previously inoculated, 1,445 had been previously vaccinated, 197 had had small-pox, and 156 were unprotected. At first 2,719 operations were successful, and as an experiment 2,032 prisoners were again vaccinated, with the result that 1,303 cases took. Vaccination was also performed on 14 prisoners one month after their recovery from small-pox, with the result that six cases were successful. The Civil Surgeon of Dacca, in view of these results, suggests the necessity of frequent re-vaccination until susceptibility is stamped out. The gist of Dr. Dyson's reply is that if one attack of small-pox does not necessarily confer immunity from a second attack, it is only reasonable that it should not neces- sarily render impossible a subsequent successful vaccination: still less will one successful vaccination necessarily prevent a second successful vaccination. Dr. Dyson quotes instances and statistics, which show conclusively that re-vaccina- tion at the age of puberty practically grants complete immunity from small-pox, and he draws the conclusion that even, if continuous vaccination is theoret- ically correct, it is neither practicable nor necessary. He finally recommends that all school children of over ten years of age, and all Government emlpoyés, should bear the mark of successful re-vaccination. The first suggestion is less practicable than the -second, which is akin to one which was made by Dr. Gregg in 1890, and again by Dr. Dyson in 1893, to the effect that, under the Factories Act (XV of 1881), all persons employed in factories should bear a similar mark. The proposal was brought to the notice of the Government of India in the annual report on the working of the Factories Act, and is under the consideration of Government in the General Department. Extent of vaccination. 14. Vaccination is now practised throughout the Province: it is com- pulsory in municipalities, but optional in rural areas, save in certain portions of Rangpur, Bhagal- pur, the Sonthal Parganas and Tippera. The Officiating Sanitary Commissioner recommends that those sections of the Bengal Vaccination Act (V of 1880) should be introduced which, without rendering vaccination universally com- pulsory, make it punishable for individuals, who have been duly served with a notice, to refuse to undergo, or to allow their children to undergo, the operation. But the Lieutenant-Governor, while he recognises that Bengal is lamentably backward in this as in other sanitary matters, and that nothing short of compulsion will bring vaccination up to what it ought to be according to
( 5 ) European standards, hesitates to adopt a measure which, even in its modified shape, must excite opposition. Sir Antony MacDonnell is not prepared to force upon the people a general measure, the importance of which they do not yet recognise, and to which in many districts ancient prejudice renders them hostile, for the present the extension of the practice of vaccination must depend on the spread of intelligence and sanitary knowledge among the people, and the influence that can be exerted by the executive officials. It was chiefly with the object of strengthening this influence that the Department was lately reorganised and its supervision localized, and the Lieutenant-Governor prefers for the present to await the results. Attitude of the people. 15. The attitude of the people towards vaccination is described by theOfficiating Sanitary Commissioner as one of pas- sive acceptance, but in nearly every district there are sections of the community who openly or covertly refuse to submit to it, objecting not so much to vaccination in itself, as to the use of human vaccinifers who are usually of low caste, and to the payment of vaccination fees. The difficulty of realizing the fees, he says, is undermining the whole system of licensed vaccination in Bengal: it tends to make the vaccinators overcharge the unsuspecting, and leads them to operate only on those who can and will pay. On the other hand, he urges that the cost of free vaccination would be small, amounting in a district like Burdwan to some 600 or 700 rupees only, which the District Board could well afford, and as a matter of fact the District Board of Puri, in pursuance of Dr. Dyson's recommendations, have since the close of the year voted a sum of Rs. 850 for this purpose. The Lieutenant-Governor is well aware of the many claims that are made on the resources of the District Board, and is averse to local funds being unnecessarily drawn upon; but vacci- nation is a matter of the greatest public importance, and is one of the legitimate objects to which the District Fund may be applied, and he would therefore, speaking generally, have no objection to District Boards whose funds are in a flourishing condition making some donation for this purpose; but much will depend upon the manner in which this contribution is expended, and before the Lieutenant-Governor can express a confident opinion, he desires that the details of the suggestion should be worked out and separately submitted. The supply of lymph. 16. Lymph was obtained during the year from the Calcutta and Darjeelingdep6ts. The former has been in existence since 1882; the latter was established in 1891. In last year's Resolution some account was given of the operations at the new depôt, and also of the process of preserving lymph by an admixture of lanoline. This system was successfully continued throughout the year, and lymph can now be preserved so as to remain active for long periods and under various changes of temperature. One of the main objects of the establishment of these depôts has thus been successfully achieved, but without largely increasing the number of depôts and the expenditure on them, it is impossible to attain the further object of supplying a sufficient quantity of lymph during the working season to enable arm-to-arm vaccination and its attendant evils to be entirely abandoned. To compass this object, Dr. Dyson suggests the introduction of the Punjab and Central Provinces plan of vaccination direct from the calf. Under this system a calf is first inoculated with lanoline lymph, and from this calf all the children of the village, as well as calves from neighbouring villages, are vaccinated. These calves are returned to their own villages after vaccination, and when the lymph is ripe, a vaccinator proceeds to the village and vaccinates from the calves all the children as well as fresh calves from other villages. The operation causes the animals but little pain and no permanent injury, and as buffalo calves serve as well as cow calves, it is easy to avoid wounding any susceptibilities. Moreover, this system has this great advantage, that it obviates the sufferings to which arm-to-arm vaccination exposes the human vaccinifer, and removes the objections urged by some to vaccination from low caste, or possibly unhealthy, children. The introduction of the scheme has been sanctioned tentatively in twelve districts during the approaching cold weather. Since the close of the year Dr. Dyson has been making experiments in goat and sheep vaccination, the results of which will shortly be reported. Prohibition of unlicensed vaccin- ation. 17. The Officiating Sanitary Commissioner urges the necessity of puttinga stop to unlicensed vaccination, which he says doesgreat harm by engendering a false sense of securityamong the persons operated on, by creating discontent among the licensed
( 6 ) operators, and by discrediting the whole system in consequence of the indiffer- ent manner in which the operations are performed. The recommendation is not new, having been pressed upon Government in 1890 and again at the com- mencement of the present year, and the Officiating Lieutenant-Governor is at one with his predecessors in thinking that it has yet to be shown that the evil has spread to any great extent, and that until this can be demonstrated there is no necessity to take any steps in the matter. Inspections. 18. The Lieutenant-Governor regrets to observe that the duty of in- spection has been inadequately performed during the year under review. Surgeon-Captain Alcock,of the Metropolitan and Eastern Bengal Circle, visited 84 villages and inspected 1,952 operations; Surgeon-Major Waddell, of the Northern Bengal Circle, visited 233 villages and inspected 3,305 operations; while the numbers for Assistant Surgeon N. N. Gupta are 715 villages and 7,569 operations. Dr. Alcock's time is said to have been much taken up with sanitary work, while Dr. Waddell was in bad health throughout the season. The amount of inspec- tion done by Civil Surgeons varied exceedingly from district to district, as was perhaps to be expected during the first year in which the reorganization of the Department took effect, but there can hardly be adequate excuse for the extent of the deficiency in some districts. The Civil Surgeon of the 24- Parganas made no inspections whatever, and those of Howrah, Burdwan, Nadia, Tippera, Shahabad and Palamau inspected the results of less than 500 operations. It is clear that these officers have overlooked the orders of Government that their visits of inspection to dispensaries should be utilised for the purpose of supervising vaccination operations also. On the other hand, Dr. Cobb of Dacca and Drs. Nicholson and Bovill of Patna, in spite of heavy duties in the station, managed to get through a creditable amount of vaccination inspection, and Sir Antony MacDonnell is gratified to find that in addition nine other Civil Surgeons, whose names will be duly noted, have been selected for special commendation for their efforts to promote vaccination. The inspection work done by the District Inspectors and the Sub-divisional Sub- Inspectors has in most cases been ridiculously inadequate. The Lieutenant- Governor trusts that the earnest attention of Civil Surgeons and their subordinate inspecting officers will be drawn to this matter, for he is convinced that in the absence of compulsory vaccination, which for reasons stated above he is not prepared at present to introduce, the success or failure of the operations depends to a very large extent on the personal interest taken in them by the local officers. 19. The Lieutenant-Governor has to thank Dr. Dyson for an interesting and suggestive report, as well as for the zeal and energy he has thrown into his work, both as Superintendent of Vaccination and Sanitary Commissioner, during his deputation to Bengal.

No. 3492. FROM SURGEON-LIEUT.-COLONEL W. H. GREGG, M.B., Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal, To THE SECRETARY To THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Calcutta, the 31st July 1894. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the following short notes on vacci- nation for the year 1893-94, which were due to Government on the 1st instant. The delay is due to the following causes:( 2 ) In the Northern Bengal Circle, Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Bovill acted as Deputy Sanitary Commissioner and Superintendent of Circle Vaccination for the first 11 days of the year, in addition to his own duties as Civil Surgeon of Patna. Surgeon-Major T. R. MacDonald was in charge from the 12th to the 19th April and Assistant Surgeon P. M. Mitter from 20th April 1893 to 20th January 1894, when Surgeon-Captain Deare took charge for the remaining two months and eleven days of the year. In the Western Bengal Circle, Surgeon-Major MacDonald was in charge for the first two days of the year and Assistant Surgeon N. N. Gupta for the next six days. He was relieved by Surgeon-Captain N. P. Sinha, who was in charge from 9th April 1893 to the 5th February 1894, when Surgeon- Captain Clarkson took over charge for the remaining month and 23 days of the year. Strength of local working and supervising staff. 3. The strength of the local supervising and working staff during 1893-94 as compared with 1892-93 is shown in the following table :( 3 ) Number of operations and average per man. 4. The following statement shows district by district, and in Calcutta andmunicipalities separately, the total number of opera- tors, the number of operations they performed and the average per man during the year under report as compared with the previous year:( 4 ) Nadia.( 5 ) Angul and Khondmals.( 6 ) It will be seen that out of 2,461,862 infants under one year of age esti- mated to be available for vaccination in the whole Province during the year under report, protection was afforded to 363,942, or 147.83 per thousand, which, though a much better result than that of the previous year, when the degree of protection was only 125.49 per mille, is still far from satisfactory. Lohardaga and Malda head the list with a proportion of 739.9 and 717.57 respectively. Palamau and Darjeeling come next with 451.66 and 438.38 respectively, Darjeeling having fallen from top place last year into fourth place during the year under report; while Cuttack (26.63) and Puri (20.29), owing to the well-known hostility of the Uriyas to vaccination, again occupy their usual position at the bottom of the list, but they have made considerable advance over 1892-93, when the figures were 7.48 and 6.23 respectively. The South Lushai Hills (formerly known as the Chittagong Hill Tracts) from being last but one in the list in 1892-93, in which year the degree of protection afforded to its infants was 6.75 only, now occupies fifth place with a proportion of 309.48. The explanation of this is that vaccination was introduced for the first time in these hills in 1892-93, when only a limited amount of work was done in selected areas. During the year under report it was extended all over the entire district, and work was pushed on vigorously by paid vaccinators. Primary operations. 6. The following statement shows district by district, and in munici- palities separately, the number of primary vaccina- tions performed in the Province during the year under report as compared with the previous year:( 7 ) Comparing this statement with column 5 of the statement in paragraph 5, it will be seen that, except in the districts of Darjeeling, Dacca, South Lushai Hills, Malda, Lohardaga and Murshidabad, the number of primary operations was less in every district, and in some considerably less than the estimated number of infants under one year of age available for vaccination, to say nothing of the large number of unprotected children between the ages of one and six and adults who have never been vaccinated. There are a very large number of these in every district. Secondary operations or revaccin- ations. 7. The following statement shows district details of secondary oper- ations or revaccinations for the year under report as compared with the figures of the previous year:( 8 ) Recess work. 8. During the recess, i.e., between the months of March and October,which is otherwise known as the non-working sea- son, the following amount of work was done, chiefly in connection with local outbreaks of small-pox, and in order to keep a small quantity of lymph alive in each district, so as to be always prepared for emer- gencies :( 9 ) Vaccination according to sex, class and age. 10. The following tables show particulars of vaccination according to sex, class and age during the year under report as compared with the previous year:( 10 ) AGE. AREA. 893-94. 1892-93.

The following statement shows the cost of vaccination during the year under report as compared with the previous year:( 11 ) As regards Calcutta the Health Officer explains that the increased expenditure of 2 pies on each successful operation was caused by the payment for the first time of house-rent to the Governors of the Mayo Native Hospital for the use of a portion of the premises as a vaccine centre or depôt, and also to slightly increased expenditure on account of contingencies. In mufassal municipalities the increase of 3 pies on each successful opera- tion is due to payments for better supervision over the work of the vacci- nators. In Provincial rural areas the increase of 2 pies on each successful operation is only apparent. In 1892-93 the expenditure shown was for the seven months after the introduction of the new vaccination scheme in August 1892. In the year under report the expenditure is for the full twelve months, which accounts for the increase. In 1890-91 each successful vaccination cost 1 anna and 7 pies, and in 1891-92 1 anna 9 pies; the average of the three years 1890(12) Diagram illustrating death-rate from Small- pox, and degree of population protected. 12. The following diagram illustrates the death-rate from Small pox in each district side by side with the proportion of population protected against thedisease by vaccination during the seven years 1887(13) GENERAL REMARKS. 13. As this report contains short notes only on vaccination, and is not an exhaustive review of the working of the department, which, under the recent orders, is now submitted triennially, I do not propose to enter into the matters which require modification or reconsideration in the new vaccination scheme, especially as this will form the subject of a separate and special communication when I am in a position, which I am not at present, to lay definite proposals before the Government. For the present, therefore, I shall confine my remarks to brief notes on the more important matters which came under consideration during the year under report. These were(14) results of children vaccinated with this lymph. The number of kids used in this instance also was very small. Vaccination direct from village calves. 15. In order to do away with the system of arm-to-arm vaccination,Dr. Dyson also suggested, while he was officiating as Sanitary Commissioner of these Provinces, the introduction of the Punjab and Central Provinces plan of vaccination direct from village calves. Under this system, as explain- ed in the Triennial Vaccination Report of 1890(15) The first calf was vaccinated on the 11th February 1894 with lanoline lymph procured from the Calcutta Depôt on 3rd February and prepared there on 30th January. Only a few points appeared successful, but owing to an error in counting, no lymph could be obtained, as it was over 126 hours old, The second calf was vacinated on 17th February, partly with fresh human lymph and partly with some lanoline lymph kept over from the previous calf vaccination. The vesicles here were also poor; but were utilized to vaccinate calf No. 3 on 22nd February (the 6th day or 117 hours). This turned out an absolute failure. The fourth calf was vaccinated on 17th March from Calcutta lanoline lymph procured on 16th March and prepared on 8th March. And the 5th calf on the 22nd March from the same. Both turned out failures. The first three calves were vaccinated under my supervision by the District Inspector, who has had some practical training at the Animal Vaccination Depôt, Calcutta, before entering the Department. The scarifier was used after following out the printed directions issued to us from the Sanitary Commissioner's office. The calves were also carefully selected. The last two calves were vaccinated by the Sadar Sub-Inspector assisted by the second municipal vaccinator, who had also previously attended the former vaccinations. &quot;We received no help from the Chairman of the Sadar Municipality, nor from any native, though several were addressed. We were informed that we should have to purchase our calves, as no one would lend them; we could then resell them after use. But this system would entail expense, and we had no means to meet such. The expense would include (a) purchase of calves, (b) their upkeep until resold, (c) construction of stables, if the jail refused to accom- modate, feed and look after them; (d) a vaccinator and barber combined to operate and attend on them. Hindu vaccinators will at first refuse to touch a calf with a lancet, although in their tender humanity they would willingly back a child to pieces. I have overcome certain of their scruples by threat of dismissal, but we must feel our way gradually. The District Inspector, however, is a high class Brahman, and when it is seen he does not hesitate to vacci- nate calves, the objections of others on that score will soon be overcome. In order to enable us to establish the calf vaccination system satisfactorily and on a permanent basis in the district, the following proposals are submitted for consideration. Let a central bovine lymph depôt be established at the head-quarters station of each district under the management and at the expense of the District Board. To this the local muni- cipality and the Jail Department should be made to contribute, especially as the latter have now to vaccinate more extensively than before. The expenses to be incurred would approximately be as follows:(16) too late then to try to introduce the system in the interior of the district. From the district Inspector's report it appears that lymph was taken from the calves on the 6th and 7th days, and that it would be difficult to introduce the system through Hindu vaccinators, who would object to make punctures on calves or cows. In my opinion this difficulty could be easily overcome by asking the District Inspector, who is a Muhammadan, to do these operations himself during his tour of inspection. The other difficulty raised by the District Inspector is that the villagers will object to have only one or two calves operated on, as they hold that the other cows and calves in their villages would die of cow-pox if not similarly protected. This could be easily overcome by having all the animals operated on in each village when the system is introduced by a paid Muhammadan vaccinator, as I understand the villagers would gladly pay a reasonable and low fee for each animal thus operated on. The District Inspector could then have an assistant to help him in operating on cows.&quot; Murshidabad.(17) The result of calf vaccination has not been satisfactory, as the people in the mufassal object and the vesicles dry up before their consent is obtained. Calf vaccination is intended for places where a large number of children are obtainable, as in towns. A good calf is capable of acting as vaccinifer to over 150 children, the village contains only smaller numbers and transit from village to village involves great loss of time and drying up of vesicles. I am of opinion calf vaccination will not prove successful and will be very expensive.&quot; These reports are not encouraging, but it must be admitted that the experi- ment has not had a fair trial, and it is clear from the reports received that very- little interest seems to have been taken in the experiment. On the other hand it is remarkable that in Dinajpur, the only district in which the trial seems to have been conducted with any zeal, the result was not a failure. I place very- little importance on the alleged objection of the people, which, as in other provinces, can easily be overcome by the exercise of judicious persuasion on the part of the local authorities, who ought to have very little difficulty in convincing the people that, as a matter of fact, there is really no objection on religious grounds to the calf being used as a vaccinifer. Caste prejudices are, I understand, just as strong in the Punjab and Central Provinces as they are in Bengal, but in the matter of direct calf vaccination they have, it would appear from the annual reports of those Provinces, been completely overcome. There is no reason why the same experience should not be ours. I would therefore recommend that the experiment of direct calf vaccination be repeated during the coming cold weather in selected parts of all the districts of the Presi- dency, Burdwan, Rajshahi, Dacca and Chittagong Divisions, Civil Surgeons being specially asked to give the trial a fair chance and their constant supervi- sion. The working of the scheme should not be left entirely to the subordi- nate staff, who chiefly to save themselves the trouble of extra labour attached to an experiment are apt to report that it cannot work. District Board vaccination. 16. A special report on the working of free vaccination as carried outduring the cold weather of 1893-94 by the District Board of Puri, who granted Rs. 850 for the ex- periment, has already been submitted for the consideration and orders of Government with this office letter No. 21T., dated the 21st May 1894, in which it was shown that as anticipated the experiment had given a remarkable impetus to vaccination in the district of Puri, which has hitherto been the most backward district in the Province in this respect, thus showing that it is not to vaccination itself that the people object, but to the payment of vaccination fees. So far, therefore, the scheme must be pronounced a complete success, but whether it should be continued at the expense of the District Board, or at all, is another question which requires serious consideration. Taking for granted that vaccination is one of the objects to which the district fund may legitimate- ly be applied, and assuming that it can be shown that man has a right to be gratuitously vaccinated(18) not at all, and in consequence also of the absence of a proper system of supply from the depôts, these institutions have hitherto not been fully utilized. This has, however, been put right since the close of the year under report, and in future the depôts will be worked to their utmost capacity, i.e., up to an output of 9,600 grains of lanoline vaccine paste a month: they cannot do more than this at present. During the recess months, i.e., from 1st April to 30th September, when vaccination is almost entirely suspended, only emergent indents will be complied with for lymph required to stamp out outbreaks of small-pox, or for any other special purpose. During the working season, from 1st October to 31st March, the monthly outturn of 9,600 grains, which will ordinarily be sufficient for the vaccination of from 19,200 to 38,400 subjects, will be supplied to the districts in proportion to their population. Attitude of the people and diffi- culty in realizing vaccination fees. 18. The attitude of the people towards vaccination continues, generallyspeaking, to be one of passive acceptance of the prophylactic with very strong objections to pay for the operation which many of them in every district manage somehow to succeed in evading with impunity. This naturally has a very disheartening influence on the licensed vaccinators, and the result is an ever-increasing difficulty in getting them to work. It was hoped when the Vaccination Department was reorganized two years ago, that the moral influ- ence which it was thought the Magistrate and Civil Surgeon of the district would be able to exercise would meet the difficulty, but it has not been success- ful in doing so. The people in rural areas have come to learn that neither the Magistrate nor the Civil Surgeon has the power to compel them to submit to vaccination, and they take advantage of the knowledge. On the other hand, the Magistrate and the Civil Surgeon, knowing that they have no legal autho- rity, naturally refrain from placing themselves in a false position by ordering the people in rural areas to be vaccinated. In these circumstances, vaccination in Bengal does not, and cannot, make satisfactory progress. In my opinion the only solution of the difficulty is either to extend the provisions of the Com- pulsory Vaccination Act throughout rural areas, or to give vaccination to the people free of charge(19) Civil Surgeons.

The Sanitary Commissioner is requested to report what necessity exists for this security, whether it is taken elsewhere, and whether it deters men from offering their services as vaccinators. 3. Number of operations and average per man.( 3 ) 1890-91 and 1891-92 hardly bears out the Sanitary Commissioner's remark that a remarkable impetus has been given to vaccination in that district by making it free. It is desirable, however, that the experiment should be continued. Mr. Coxe, the Magistrate, and Dr. Banks, the Civil Medial Officer, have displayed much interest in the working of the department. 8. Cost of vaccination.( 4 ) the Health Officer has done very little inspection. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioners inspected 1,516 villages, against 1,032 in the previous year. The increase is satisfactory. 13. Vaccination is perhaps the least successful of all the departments under the Bengal Government, and the Lieutenant-Governor regrets to observe that there is in this report no indication of any consciousness of this failureANNUAL STATISTICAL RETURNS AND SHORT NOTES ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL FOR THE YEAR 1894-95.

ANNUAL STATISTICAL RETURNS AND SHORT NOTES ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL FOR THE YEAR 1894-95. BY BRIGADE-SURGEON-LIEUT.-COLONEL W. H. GREGG, M.B., M.R.C.P., London, Dip. Publ. Health, Camb., Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal. Calcutta: PRINTED AT THE BENGAL SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1895.
No. FROM BRIGADE-SURGN.-LIEUT.-COL. W. H. GREGG, M.B., M.R.C.P. DIP. PUB. HEALTH, CAMB., Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Darjeeling, the 21st June 1895. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit, for the information of Government, the following short notes on Vaccination in Bengal during the year 1894-95. Controlling officers. 2. I was in charge of the department throughout the year, and was ably and willingly assisted in the control of vaccination by Civil Surgeons (each of whom was directly responsible for his own district) and the following Deputy Sanitary Com- missioners who also greatly assisted in inspecting the work of vaccination wherever they travelled, and brought to notice any irregularities detected. In the Metropolitan and Eastern Bengal Circle Surgeon-Captain Moir was in charge from the 1st April to the 4th June 1894, Surgeon-Captain Harold-Brown from the 5th to the 27th June 1894, Surgeon-Captain Oldham from the 28th June 1894 to the 20th February 1895, and Surgeon-Captain Sinha from the 21st February 1895 to the end of the official year under report, viz., the 31st March 1895. In the Northern Bengal Circle Surgeon-Captain Deare was in charge from 1st April 1894 to 24th March 1895, and Surgeon-Major Waddell from 25th to 31st March 1895. In the Western Bengal Circle Surgeon-Captain Clarkson was in charge from the 1st April 1894 to the 5th July 1894, and Surgeon-Captain Vaughan from the 6th July 1894 to the end of the year. Progress of vaccination. 3. I can confidently say that I have never known the Vaccination Depart- ment in Bengal to be in such an efficient state as it is at present. The reorganisation of the Depart- ment in 1892, by which district vaccination was placed under the direct control of Civil Surgeons assisted by District Magistrates, has resulted in increased efficiency. The stricter supervision of vaccine operations, the result of this change, has brought to light many small irregularities which have been corrected, and has resulted in more accurate returns being submitted than was formerly the case. I have no doubt from what I have seen during my own tours, and from what I have learned from Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and District Officials, that the returns are still not as accurate as we should wish them to be; it should, however, be remembered that licensed vaccinators, although they are, as a rule, well-meaning, hard-working and intelligent men, anxious to do what is right and to earn their living respectably, are very timid and are afraid to enter all cases of vaccination in their returns that have not been thoroughly successful, while all doubtful cases they carefully suppress, as they think by introducing such cases into their returns they render themselves liable to be harassed by inspecting officers, especially enthusiastic Sub-Inspectors looking for promotion; their returns consequently show an incredibly high percentage of successful cases. There cannot also be the slightest doubt that a very much larger number of persons are vaccinated than are shown in the returns, and that B
( 2 ) this opinion is correct is supported by the low death-rate from small-pox which occurred during the year under report, viz., .13 per mille. In connection with the above figures it should be remembered that the registration of vital statistics generally is now much more carefully performed than was formerly the case, also that deaths from small-pox like those of cholera are probably more correctly registered than most other fatal diseases; and though every effort is being made to encourage vaccinators to enter all cases vaccinated, still the returns are somewhat misleading, as they do not show the full number of persons vaccinated, and they give too high a percentage of the number of successful cases. In this connection I should like to draw attention to a paper I read before the Medical Congress in December last on Vaccination in Bengal, a copy of which will be found in the Appendix. Full strength of establishment. 4. The full strength of the vaccination establishment during 1894-95, as compared with 1893-94, s shown in the following table ( 3 ) Number of operations and aver- age per man. 5. Thefollowing statement shows district by district and in Calcutta and municipalities separately the total number of operators, the number of operations they performed, and the average per man during the year under report as compared with the previous year:( 4 ) season by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner of the Metropolitan and Eastern Bengal Circle. As I have already pointed out, vaccination is more backward in the Orissa and Chittagong Divisions than in any other part of the province; consequently the Superintendents and Inspectors in these Divisions have a very difficult work to perform and deserve credit for what they have accomplished during the year. The following explanations are given by the Civil Surgeons of the districts which show a decrease of operations:( 5 ) unequal in population, the returns have always shown a yearly fluctuation of several thousands. In 1893-94, however, the increase was much above the normal of the best year; this was to some extent due to an effort which was made towards the end of that season to vaccinate the whole of the thana which naturally has tended to reduce further the numbers available for the year under report. Singhbhum.( 6 ) It will be seen that the total estimated number of infants under one year available for vaccination was 2,491,305, of whom 405,065, or 162.59 per thou- sand, were successfully vaccinated. This is a better result than that of the previous year when the degree of protection afforded to infants was reported as only 147.83 per mille. Malda, Lohardaga, Darjeeling and Palamau, in the order named, are again at the top of the list with the best results, while Gaya, Puri, Shahabad, Cuttack, the Tributary States of Orissa, and Patna again show the worst results. It will also be observed that there are marked differences between districts which differ very little, if at all, in the character of their population. I think these marked differences must to a large extent be attributed to unequal activity of work on the part of the executive. In muni- cipalities it will be seen that the degree of protection is very much higher than in rural areas, which is mainly due to vaccination being compulsory in the former. Primary operations. 7. The following statement shows district by district and in municipali- ties separately the number of primary operations performed during the year under report as compared with the previous year:( 7 ) There is, it will be seen, a slight decrease in the ratio per cent. of suc- cessful cases as compared with the previous year, the rate of 1894-95 being 98.66 per cent. against 99.20 per cent. in 1893-94. This shows, not that the success of vaccination is falling off, but that greater care is being exercised in checking the vaccinators' returns of successful cases. The ratio per cent. of successful cases returned for the province is still, I believe, higher than it should be, but I have no doubt that this high percentage is due to the unwilling- ness of licensed vaccinators to include in their lists any except perfect cases of operation. Licensed vaccinators are in most cases reliable good men, but they do not fall in with the official idea of the utility of entering all cases of vaccination in their lists. Efforts are being made to get over this difficulty, which I trust will ultimately be successful. Revaccination. 8. The following statement shows district details of revaccination during the year under report as compared with the previous year:( 8 ) Recess-work. 9. During the recess, i.e., from the months of April to September, which is otherwise known as the non-working season, the following amount of work was done chiefly in con- nection with local outbreaks of small-pox, and in order to keep a small quantity of lymph alive in each district, so as to be prepared for emergencies( 9 ) transferred, but being the first year of operation and late arrival of the vaccinators, much work could not be done.

( 11 ) Cost of vaccination. 12. The following statement shows the cost of vaccination during the year under report as compared with the previous year:( 12 ) Diagram illustrating death-rate from Small- pox, and degree of protection afforded. 14. The following diagram illustrates the death-rate from Small-pox in each district side by side with the proportion of population protected against the disease by vaccination during the past seven years:( 13 ) It is very remarkable that in the district which is best protected, viz., Darjeeling, there were absolutely no deaths from small-pox during the year under report, whilst the highest death-rates occurred in those districts which show low ratios of protected population. The very high death-rate in Calcutta, which it will be seen is not as well protected as most of the districts of Bengal, occurred chiefly in connection with the late epidemic of small-pox in that city. The high proportion of protected persons, as shown in the diagram under the Chittagong district, is suspicious and hard to credit. I believe that the figures supplied previous to the year 1892 (in which the re- organisation of the Department took place) must have been inaccurate. The figures which are now being supplied are fairly correct. Comparative value of the three methods of vaccination. 15. The following statement which appears for the first time and has been prepared with considerable difficulty shows the com- parative value of the three methods of vaccination in vogue in the province, viz., (1) direct from the calf, (2) with lanoline vaccine paste prepared at the Animal Vaccine Depôts at Calcutta and Darjeeling, and (3) from the human subject by arm-to-arm trans- fer. The figures cannot, however, be accepted as altogether trustworthy, as licensed vaccinators have a tendency to give the percentage of successful cases too high ; and as most of these operations are done by the arm-to-arm process, the percentage under this head appears to be excessive. My own impression is that lymph when properly procured by the arm-to-arm process and from healthy children is of equal value to the lymph procured direct from calves. Lymph diluted with lanoline requires to be more carefully manipulated than is the case with pure lymph, and this difficulty was the cause of the low percentage of successful operations by this method in the Monghyr, Bhagalpur, and Singh- bhum districts. In skilful hands well mixed lanoline lymph is as successful as pure lymph :( 14 ) Statement showing the comparative value of the three methods of Vaccination in vogue in Bengal during 1894-95.

( 15 ) Vaccination direct from local calves. 16. The system of using locally raised calf lymph is an excellent one, and well suited for the requirement of many places in Bengal, where large numbers of persons have to be vaccinated within a limited time, as in munici- palities, jails, factories, lunatic asylums, tea-gardens, &c., and during outbreaks of small-pox. When a considerable amount of lymph is suddenly wanted, no better system can be adopted. Our villages in Bengal, however, are so scat- tered, in many cases consisting of only a few houses, that they are conse- quently not so suited for this method of vaccination as are the large compact villages of the Punjab. This mode of vaccination has therefore been restricted to localities where persons are closely congregated. In this connection it may here be mentioned that certain religious scruples having been experienced by some District Inspector of Vaccination and others against calf vaccination, it was found necessary to obtain the opinion of the Nadia pandits on the religious aspect of the subject. Their opinion will be found in the Appendix, and it will be seen that after mature consideration they deliberately held that there was no objection on the score of religion to the vaccination of calves. As to the method of vaccinating from local calves, instructions were issued to Civil Surgeons in circular No. 4T. of the 29th September 1894, which will also be found in the Appendix. The Civil Surgeon of Midnapore, Dr. O'Gorman, and the Civil Medical Officer of Dinajpur, Dr. Blaker, deserve special mention for their successful efforts in furthering calf vaccination. District Board vaccination. 17. This was carried out only in the districts of Puri, Tippera and Gaya: the amount paid by these Boards has already been noted in the cost statement. Kid vaccination. 18. A few experiments were made in the Calcutta Animal Vaccine Depart- ment, but were unsuccessful. The present Deputy Sanitary Commissioner of the Metropolitan Circle, Dr. Sinha, in reporting this has asked for permission to carry out further experi- ments for two or three months. This has been granted. Security deposit system. 19. In last year's Government resolution it was stated that the Commissioner of Orissa had reported that a decrease took place in the number of vaccinators in Balasore owing to the demand of a security deposit of Rs. 10, and in Government order No. 178S., dated the 15th January last, I was directed to watch carefully the operation of this system and to note the result in this annual report. The Civil Surgeons, who have all been consulted on the subject, almost without exception, report that the system is working well and is necessary. This is also my opinion. If the system were abolished, Superintendents of Vaccination would have little hold on the licensed vaccinators, and there would be no protection against loss in case the vaccinators absconded with lancets or other Government property in their charge. It has not generally been found to deter men from offering their services as vaccinators. Civil Surgeons have, however, the option of reduc- ing the amount of the deposit, or entirely doing away with it, if they think it desirable to do so. Difficulty in realizing fees. 20. In every district, more or less, difficulty is experienced by the vaccinators in realizing their fees: the local district officers lend their assistance whenever it is specially applied for, but generally it is not of much use as the people have come to know that there is no law under which they can be compelled to pay up except through a civil court, and they know it is not worth the vaccinators' while to sue them there for the sake of two annas only in each case. Animal vaccination depôts. 21. In order to fully utilize the vaccination depôts at Calcutta and Darjeeling, instructions were issued to the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners in charge of those institu- tions to work the depôts to their full extent during the vaccination season. These instructions, a copy of which is given in the appendix (see circular No. 338 of the 7th June 1894), have been carefully attended to with satisfactory results. Inspection of officers. 22.

A few Hindu families in the Phalia tahsil did have their children vaccinated direct from the calf, and I have no doubt, when the Hindus get more accustomed to seeing it done, their scruples will be overcome.&quot; Doctor Mulrony adds:xxviii 2. The statement given in page 9 of the Report shows how much animal lymph vaccination has progressed since it was first introduced into this Province in 1885-86. The total number of operations performed during the past year was 246,105, of which number 241,014 were done with buffalo lymph and 5,091 with calf lymph. 3. As the vaccinating season will soon begin, I take this opportunity of again inviting your attention to this important subject and request you will use your most strenuous efforts to extend the system of buffalo lymph vaccination, as far as practicable, in every part of your district. 4. Should you experience any opposition, either active or passive, in this matter from the members of the District Vaccination Staff or from any class of people in the district, I beg that you will at once report the matter to me.

xxxi TRANSLATION. To THE LEARNED IN VARIOUS SHASTRAS, MEMBERS OF THE COLLEGE OF PUNDITS, NADIA. 1. If a Hindu takes cow-lymph from the body of a cow suffering from cow-pox for the purpose of vaccinating human beings, does he thereby incur any sin? 2. If a Hindu vaccinator vaccinates a Hindu child with cow-lymph taken from the body of a cow suffering from cow-pox, is the religion of the vaccinator or of the person vacci- nated affected in any way? 3. If with a view to protect cows from cow-pox, a Hindu vaccinates a cow in the manner in which human beings are vaccinated, does he thereby commit any offence against the Shastras? MOHENDRA NATH VIDYARATNA BHATTACHARJEE, M.A., B.L., Deputy Magistrate, Nadia. The 24th December .1894. Answers of the Pandits. 1. If a Brahman or other vaccinator following the religion of the Vedas causes a wound in the body of a cow, suffering from cow-pox in taking cow-lymph thereform for the good of human beings, the person who does so incurs no sin thereby. Such is the opinion of the learned. 2. If human beings are vaccinated with the cow-lymph for the purpose of preventing the dangerous disease of small-pox, neither the person who vaccinates nor the person vaccinat- ed incurs any sin. Such is the opinion of the learned. 3. For the purpose of preventing cow-pox among cows, there is no objection to vacci- nating cows in the manner in which human beings are vaccinated. Such is the opinion of the learned. SRI JADUNATH SARVABHAUM SHARMA, Nadia. SRI MADHUSUDAN SMRITIRATNA, Nadia. SRI LALMOHON VIDYABAGISH, Nadia. SRI PRASANNA KUMAR VIDYARATNA, Nadia.

xxxii Circular No. 338, dated Calcutta, the 7th June 1894. Fromxxxiii capable of manufacturing more than 1,200 grains of lanoline vaccine paste each a week for distribution to districts. That is to say, for the whole province, 2,400 grains will be avail- able every week. If this amount was distributed weekly among the 47 districts, the supply to each district would be very small, while the amount of clerical labour and postage involved would be unnecessarily large. It has therefore been decided to divide the province into groups of six districts and for each depôt to supply one of its four groups every week with the total quantity of lymph available. Thus group A will be supplied with lymph during the first week of every month up to a limit of 1,200 grains, which will be divided among the six districts in proportion to their population. Group B will be similarly supplied during the 2nd week; group C during the 3rd week, and group D during the 4th week of every month. To make these instructions clearer, the following statement is given, which shows (1) the quantity of lymph up to which each Civil Surgeon may indent once a month, (2) the depôt to which the indent should be sent, and (3) the week of the month during which the indent will be complied with. Indents should reach the depôt at least a week before the prescribed week of supply:xxxiv VACCINATION IN BENGAL. IT has been suggested to me that a short account of the system of vaccination in Bengal would be interesting and instructive, not only to medical men generally and others in Bengal and other provinces in India, but also to people in England, who take an interest in Indian subjects. 2. To persons unacquainted with the practical working of vaccination in a province like Bengal, it seems an easy matter to inaugurate and carry on a complete and successful system of protection from small-pox, but the difficulty of doing so in Bengal is great, as will be at once apparent when the area, population, and conflicting interests of the people of these provinces are taken into consideration. Any system to be successful in Bengal must there- fore be simple, effective, moderate in cost, and suited to the requirements of the various classes of the people. Bengal is the largest of the Indian provinces: it has an area of 151,543 square miles, which is equal to that of the United Kingdom, with the addition of a second Scotland; whilst the population of 71,346,987 is about that of the whole of the United States of America in 1890, together with Mexico. There are 47 districts in Bengal, each covering an average area of 3,224 square miles and containing an average population of 1,503,520 inhabitants, which is greater than the average population of the districts of other provinces and three times greater than the average population of the Punjab districts, which is 673,124, although the average district area in the Punjab, viz. 3,570 square miles, is about the same as that of Bengal, which is 3,224 square miles. Then, too, the villages in Bengal are more scattered than they are in other parts of India. The supervision of vaccination in Bengal is thus especially difficult, and it is necessary to employ a larger number of workers than in other provinces in proportion to the population. 3. The system of work in Bengal is as follows :xxxv acquainted with the usages and prejudices of the people among whom they work. It is to their interest to perform vaccination operations carefully and with good lymph, as they are paid by the people only for each successful case. 6. When a serious outbreak of small-pox occurs, which is but seldom, vaccinators paid by Government at the rate of 4 annas a day each are specially appointed by the Civil Surgeon to stamp it out. 7. The lymph used in Bengal is obtained from two sourcesMUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. SANITATION. CALCUTTA, THE 12th AUGUST 1895. RESOLUTION( 2 ) successful in pushing vaccination in a backward district, the number of vaccinations performed in the district having risen from 16,828 in 1893-94 to 20,234 in the year under report. Twelve districts show a falling off, the decline being largest in( 3 ) for, and arrangements were made for retaining in the villages the list of vacci- nations performed in order that inspecting officers might test it, the Sanitary- Commissioner still omitted to lay before Government the facts which furnished a clue to the whole difficulty. The Lieutenant-Governor trusts that Dr. Gregg's successor will take this matter vigorously in hand and will lose no time in putting a stop to a dishonest practice which makes it impossible to obtain a true view of the working of an important department. 6. Secondary operations.( 4 ) vaccine lymph prepared with lanoline,(3) with human lymph taken by arm-to- arm transfer. The Sanitary Commissioner has prepared a statement, given at page 14 of his notes, which purports to show the comparative value of the three methods. But in the first place the statement is extremely incomplete, and whatever value it might possess is nullified by the doubt as to the value of any statistics from which all negative instances have been eliminated. A few experiments in vaccination from the kid were made during the year, but they proved a failure. Further experiments are being conducted. The animal vaccine depôts at Calcutta and Darjeeling are said to have worked well, but no particulars are given by which to judge of their progress, nor is any mention made of the interesting fact that in August 1894 the Nepal Darbar asked for a supply of lanoline vaccine paste in order to introduce vaccination on a large scale. When Sir Charles Elliott visited Nepal in November last he learned that the Prime Minister was an earnest advocate of vaccination and had had his own family vaccinated. The Lieutenant-Governor considered it extremely desirable to encourage this enlightened movement, not only from motives of humanity, but in order to enlist the influence of the leading Hindu State in India on the side of vaccination. Arrangements have accordingly been made to provide the Nepal Darbar with a regular supply of vaccine lymph. Sir Charles Elliott trusts that the Sanitary Commissioner will realise the importance of assisting the Darbar in this matter by all means in his power. 11.

This statement shows how unequally the important work of inspections is performed by Inspectors. It will be seen that, whereas the Dacca Inspector found it possible to see as many as 72,331 out of the 141,822 operations per- formed in the district, the Inspectors of Howrah and the districts below it on
( 19 ) the list could not manage to inspect as many even as 10,000 operations in the whole year! There is really no excuse for this short outturn of work, and the attention of the Civil Surgeons of the districts concerned will be drawn to the matter. It is their duty primarily to see that a much larger amount of inspection work is done by their subordinates. Sub-Inspectors. DISTRICT. Number of villages in his jurisdiction.

( 20 ) Diagrams illustrating death-rate from Small- pox, and degree of population protected. 14. In accordance with precedent I give the following diagrams illustrating the death-rates from Small-pox in each district during each of the three years ofthe triennial period under review with side by side the proportion of population protected against the disease by vaccination during the seven preceding years. 1887-94. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] NOTE.( 21 ) 1888-95. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] NOTE.( 22 ) 1889-96. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] NOTE.( 23 ) These diagrams do not prove very much, but they show that where vaccination has been actively carried on, there small-pox as a general rule is comparatively low, and vice versâ. 15. The following statement shows the comparative value of the three methods of vaccination at present practised in Bengal, viz., direct from the calf, from lanoline paste, and the arm-to-arm method of human lymph. In consequence, however, of the erroneous practice of excluding unsuccessful opera- tions and including repetitions in the case of the arm-to-arm method, a com- parison between that and the other methods is vitiated. The following state- ments are, therefore, at present of no comparative value, and I only give them because it has been the custom to do so. DISTRICT. PRIMARY. Direct from calf.

Invariably the children used as vaccinifers are low caste and unhealthy. No woman of the well-to-do classes will allow her child to be used as a vaccinifer. On the other hand, the advantages of vaccination direct from the calf are distinct, and obviously superior to any other kind of lymph. In the first place, the lymph is pure, the only danger being from tuberculosis which, however, is not a common disease among cattle in this country. Secondly, this source of supply is practically inexhaustible, and thirdly, the poorer people are not harassed to supply their babies as vaccinifers, which is an important consideration. The advantages of direct calf-vaccina- tion are so great, that it is fast gaining a strong foothold in the public estima- tion. Three years ago when I was officiating as Sanitary Commissioner of these Provinces, and suggested this idea for mufassal towns and rural areas, there was immediately a storm of opposition; religious prejudices were put forward, and the impossibility of inducing the people to give up their calves
( 25 ) temporarily was said to be insuperable. Judicious perseverence, however, in some places, in accordance with my expressed conviction that it would succeed, has gained the day, and I now find on returning to Bengal that there is scarcely any prejudice in the northern, eastern and lower districts of the Province. I have not had time yet to gauge the public feeling on the subject in Bihar and Western Bengal, but I am assured by officials who know those parts of the Province, and have learnt to appreciate the advantage of calf-vaccination, that there will be no difficulty in introducing the method there. I hope, therefore, before I lay down the Sanitary Commissionership of Bengal, to see nothing but calf vaccination practiced throughout the Province. Lano- line vaccine-paste, which is a mixture of calf virus, and lanoline(26) in future be vigorously carried on, and that if more lanoline vaccine was required at any time, it would be asked for. No more has since been demanded. General remarks. 17. In conclusion it only remains for me to make a few general remarkson vaccination in connection with small-pox. This disease is now, thanks to the prophylactic dis- covered by Jenner 100 years ago, the least prevalent of all the fatal diseases. It is sometimes ignorantly urged that this is due not to the use of vaccination, but to the decrease of variolous inoculation. It is also asserted that the decline in the small-pox fatality is due to improved sanitation. Doubtless to some extent personal and municipal cleanliness, good food and pure water, have beneficial effects on all diseases, and in the benefit small-pox has had its share, but the lessening of small-pox cannot be set down to improved drainage and water-supply any more than can the lessening of enteric fever be set down to vaccination. There is abundant evidence the world over, and a mass of statistics to prove the influence of vaccination and the remarkable decrease that has taken place in the small-pox mortality following the introduction of the prophylactic. There are many people, however, who will not take the trouble to study figures, and who excuse themselves by the easy statement that statistics can prove anything. For such people, the following illustrations may be instruc- tive:(27) sufficient testimony of the good work it has done. Dr.Deare, I consider, deserves the special thanks of Government for his tact and discretion in this con- nectionSTATISTICAL RETURNS. a

ON taking over charge of the Metropolitan and Eastern Bengal Circle in November 1895,I was directed by the Sanitary Commissioner of Bengal to address myself specially to the work of starting and promoting vaccination among the Ferazi Mussalmans of Eastern Bengal, who had up to that time successfully withstood every attempt, whether by the Sanitary Department, or local officials, to introduce vaccination among them. As the head-quarters of the Ferazi sect are to be found in the Faridpur district, I decided to commence work here, and thus strike at the root and source of the opposition. Brief history of the Ferazi movement, with the particular tenets held by the sect. The Ferazis belong to the Suni Division of the Muhammadan faith, and may aptly be described as the Puritans of the Mussalman religion, their position being very similar to that of the Pharisees in the Jewish dispensation. The sect was first started by one Haji Sharitulla, who was brought up and educated by his uncle, Maulvi Muhammad Ashak Mufti, in the Murshidabad Nawab's Court, the Nawab being at that time ruler of Bengal. As he was a bright promising lad, his relations, in order to give him every educational advantage in their power, sent him first to Hindustan (Delhi), and then to Mecca and Medina. In these latter cities, where he resided for some time, he came under the influence of Abdul Wahab and his chief disciples, and gave up the ethical standards of the Hanifi sect for the sake of what he learnt to regard as the purer doctrine of the new reformer. He returned to India imbued with Wahabiism, and ultimately took up his residence at Daulatpore village, Shibchar thana, Faridpur. This was in about the year 1780. Finding that the religious life of the Muhammadans round about had greatly deteriorat- ed by contact with Hindu idolatry, he addressed himself to the task of reforming their practices with the aid of the new theology he had learnt in Arabia. In fact it was a modified Wahabîism that he sought to enforce, and it was not long before he gathered an immense following in Eastern Bengal. He taught: xxv its worst characteristics: the people are not so fanatical as they were; they are now loyal, and represent, simply and purely, a religious power in Eastern Bengal. Clinging, as they do, to their religious prejudices with great tenacity, they have till very recent ly resisted vaccination in a most determined spirit, driving away inspectors, sub-inspectors of vaccination and vaccinators from their houses, until these officials have been positively afraid to venture into their villages. Small-pox has annually ravaged their homesteads, and the death-rate from this cause has been high. In one large village (Outrail) which I visited early in December, there had been 200 deaths in two weeks, and in every village one sees the frightful effects of this disease. History of my tour. It was among this people then that I had to work. It was my duty to endeavour todisarm the universal prejudice against vaccination, a prejudice all the more obstinate because it was religious. We commenced work I am sure á la bonne hewee. The villagers were groaning under the scourge of small pox, mothers and fathers saw their offspring dying, and were torn by conflicting forces. They wished to protect their children, and yet dared not be unfaithful to their religious convictions, as such infidelity would involve an ostracism from which there would be no release until a heavy fine had been paid to the Maulvi Haji or other spiritual leader. Knowing this to be the feeling, I determined to commence by trying to disarm the prejudices of the High Priest and his head Maulvis on the subject of vaccination, for it must be understood that the great majority of the Ferazis are ignorant and illiterate, and the word of their High Priest is to them religion and law, and whatever has the sanction of established custom cannot be departed from with impunity:xxvi In this way we visited all the thanas in the Madaripur and Sadar subdivisions in which the Ferazis live,- and the work spread d pas de géant; the people accepted vaccination readily, and there has not been the slightest disturbance of any kind. Of course this has been due in a very great measure to Maulvi Syeddudin Ahmad, the High Priest, who has loyally carried out all my wishes, and given the whole weight of his influence to the success of my undertaking. I was now eager to complete the work by persuading the High Priest to have his own children vaccinated, for I felt that if I could do this, I should enlist his sympathies per- manently on the side of vaccination, should have a firmer hold on the people by being able to quote his example, and should have the best guarantee that the practice of vaccination had been firmly established among them. Syeddudin Ahmad was out on his annual tour when we met the first two or three times, and although he was willing to have his children vaccinated, he wanted it done when he should be at home. In the meantime he gave me a letter, directing that his eldest son (a pupil in the Dacca Madrassa) should be vaccinated at once. This I for- warded to Dr. Russell, Civil Surgeon of Dacca, who kindly saw that the work was done; but it was not until February 1896 that I was able to meet the High Priest at his house, where I met his eldest son who had returned from Dacca. I vaccinated his other children with my own hands before many of his principal followers. This being done, I and my staff both felt that the crisis was over, that the Farazi opposition to vaccination was a thing of the past. A curious local superstition. While touring in this district the villagers have often told me with great earnestnessthat one of their objections to vaccination was this :xxvii At present the work is only limited by the amount of lanoline lymph supplied, and early in the year I made arrangements, with the consent of the Sanitary Commissinor, Bengal, by which these two subdivisions receive 800 grains every week, i.e., enough to vaccinate 12,800 persons a month. Again, it should be remembered that although the Ferazi population is immense, small- pox has been such a scourge among them that large numbers need no vaccination, having already had the disease. Inspection results. I have altogether visited 274 Ferazi villages in this dis- trict, and have inspected 6,039 cases, giving the following results:xxviii opposition to a measure that had up to this time been resisted with the utmost bigotry, and by boldly setting an example in his own family, loyally and effectually to help on our work among his people. Unlike his father he is highly respected by his neighbours, and being a fairly wealthy man he recognises the duties which devolve on those thus endowed, and subscribes to numerous local charities, such as dispensaries, Madrassas, &c. I would there- fore bring his name prominently to the notice of the Sanitary Commissioner as a man deserv- ing some marked recognition at the hands of Government. 2. I have also to express my sense of indebtedness to Moulvi Fazal Karim, Subdivi- sional Officer, Madaripur, who has throughout my tour ably and zealously supported my endeavours, and has contributed in no small degree to the success I am able to report. 3. I would suggest that the thanks of the Sanitary Department be given to Babu Niranjan Rai, zamindar, Panchar, post-office Shibchar, a gentleman of much local influence, who has also greatly assisted us. I have to thank Dr. N. P. Gupta, the Civil Medical Officer, Faridpur, for allowing me the free use of his vaccination staff, which has enabled me to concentrate forces at weak points, and thus push on the work. I have also been ably seconded in my efforts by the District Inspector of Vaccination, Babu Baikunto Nath Bomick. I am in hopes that the work begun in Faridpur will not now stop, but will gradually extend wherever Ferazis are to be found in Eastern Bengal, and will have the effect of lowering the mortality from small-pox, which up to the present has had its home and nursery in the Ferazi villages of Eastern Bengal.

The amount of inspection done by Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors varied greatly from district to district. While the Inspector at Dacca inspected 72,331 out of 141,822 operations performed in the district, the Inspector at Howrah could not manage to inspect as many as 10,000 operations. The special attention of the Civil Surgeons should be drawn to the matter. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, H. H. RISLEY, Secretary to the Govt. of Bengal. No. 3710S.

ANNUAL STATISTICAL RETURNS AND SHORT NOTES ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL FOR THE YEAR 1896-97. BY SURGEON-MAJOR H. J. DYSON, F.R.C.S, Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal. Calcutta: BENGAL SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1897.
SHORT NOTES ON VACCINATION FOR THE YEAR 1896-97. THE following are short notes on vaccination in Bengal for the year 1896-97. Officer in charge of the Depart- ment. 2. I was in charge of the Department throughout the year, and hadunder me the following Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioners to supervise the work of vaccination. In Metropolitan Circle Surgeon-Captain R. Scott from 15th April to 14th July and from 26th October to 25th November 1896; Dr. Hay Jagannadham from 30th July to 25th October 1896; Surgeon-Captain Oldham from 10th December 1896 to 5th March 1897; and Surgeon-Captain Jay Gould from 6th to 31st March 1897. There was no Deputy Sanitary Commissioner in this. Circle from the 1st to 14th April, from 15th to 29th July and from 26th November to 9th December 1896. I looked after the current duties of the office during those periods in addition to my own work. In the Northern Bengal Circle Surgeon-Captain B. H. Deare throughout the year. In the Western Bengal Circle Surgeon-Captain J. C. S. Vaughan from 1st April to 22nd December 1896, and Surgeon-Captain E. S. Peck from 23rd December 1896 to 31st March 1897. During the whole of the working season, viz., from October to March, these officers were on plague duty, and were thus unable to do much vaccination inspection. Strength of staff. 3. The following table shows the full strength of the subordinate workingstaff during the year under report as compared with the previous year with explanations in the remarks column of increases and decreases:( 2 ) average per man during the year under report as compared with the previous year:( 3 ) where the pinch of famine was much more felt than in other subdivisions, was mainly responsible for this decrease.&quot; Khulna.( 4 ) to eat, and have no money to spare for luxuries, such as vaccination appears to them to be. Bhagalpur.( 5 ) There is a slight increase in the ratio per cent. as compared with the previ- year, viz., 98.50 against 98.39 per cent. in 1895-96. But these figures are incredible. It has already been explained in previous reports that these high percentages are due to the dishonest practice of vaccinators excluding unsuccess- ful cases from the returns, and even entering absolute or partial failures as suc- cessful vaccinations. The only way, as I have explained to local officers, to stop this practice is by their seeing that the inspecting staff exercises stricter supervi- sion over the work of the licensed vaccinators, who hardly understand the utility of entering all cases, either successful or unsuccessful, in their lists. Surgeon- Lieutenant-Colonel A. Stephens has detected cases in Purnea in which vaccinators did not enter in their diaries the names of the children vaccinated, until there was no doubt that the cases were successful! I believe this practice is universal.The attention of Civil Surgeons will again be called to the matter. Protection afforded to infants. 6. The following statement shows in order of sequence the degree ofprotection afforded to infants in each district of Bengal during the year under review, as compared with 1895-96, calculated as usual on an estimated birth at 40 per 1,000.

This is satisfactory so far as it goes, but I doubt the accuracy of the figures supplied when there are such extreme differences as between 876.89 per mille in Darjeeling and 37.49 in Gaya. One can only conclude from such varia- tions that the proportion of infants protected is either overstated or understated in many districts. The increase during the year under report is shown to have taken place in every district, except Angul and Khondmals, the Political States of Chota Nagpur, Hazaribagh, Balasore, Saran, Singhbhum, Noakhali, Tippera,
( 7 ) Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Khulna, Gaya and Calcutta Animal Vaccine Depôt No explanation of the falling off in these districts has been given by the local officers. Forty per mille has, as stated in the preceding, paragraph been taken in calculating the birth-rate of the Province, but if we take the probably more accurate estimate of 51.8 per 1,000 calculated by Mr. Hardy on the last census, the degree of protection afforded to infants works out thus:( 8 ) This reduces the proportion of infants protected under 1 year from 202.81 to 149.79, and the figures of Darjeeling, which is the best protected district, from 876.89 to 638.82. In connection with infant vaccination I recommended in last year's report that three punctures should be made in each arm, as is the practice in the Panjab, and I was asked by Government to submit for approval a draft of the instructions I proposed issuing on the subject. I have, however, in consultation with the officers of the Department deferred doing so pending the reorganization of the Sanitary Department by its amal- gamation with the Medical Department, which will be a more appropriate time to rearrange the whole working of Vaccination in Bengal.

The following diagram illustrates the death-rates from small-pox in each district with side by side the proportion of popolution protected against the disease by vaccination during the past seven years :( 14 ) The object of this diagram is to show that the best protected districts suffer least from small-pox. Owing, however, to defective registration this is not quite borne out in the illustration given, though it shows generally that small-pox is most prevalent in the districts which are least protected. The diagram is gradually becoming more reliable, and will in time prove the efficacy of vaccination. Animal Vaccination Depôts. 13.

The figures speak for themselves, and are very satisfactory in most of those districts in which this method of vaccination is carried on. When I sug- gested vaccination direct from the calf in 1893 instead of the arm-to-arm me- thod I was told that it was impossible in Bengal. I persevered, however, with the idea, and the above figures show what has been done in the three years which have since elapsed. I decline to believe that the system is impractica- ble in the districts which show no work in this connection. All that is necessary is a little interest on the part of the Civil Surgeons, who, I venture to suggest, should be directed by Government to introduce direct calf vaccination without further delay. Supply of lanoline lymph to Nepal. 15. As the arm-to-arm method of vaccination with human virus is practisedin Nepal, it was expected that there would have been no demand for lanoline vaccine paste from Bengal, but during the year under report as much as 1,845 grains were asked for and supplied to the Nepal Durbar from the Animal Vacci- nation Depôtat Darjeeling. The result in all cases is not yet known, but from the returns which have been furnished it appears that out of 596 persons primarily vaccinated with this lymph, 516 proved successful, 6 doubtful, 18 unsuccessful and 56 unknown. Inspections. 16. The inspections performed by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners,Civil Surgeons, Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors of Vaccination are given below in order of sequence.

( 20 ) In the case of Sub-Inspectors there is great variation again in the work of inspection, the highest being 99,869 in Dacca and the lowest 4,175 in Angul. The special attention of Civil Surgeons was drawn to this matter, and an enquiry was instituted by them to ascertain whether the extraordinary varia- tions even in adjoining districts were not due chiefly to negligence on the part of the subordinate inspecting officers. It appears from the reports which have been received that almost all the Civil Surgeons are satisfied that this is not the case, but that the variations are to be attributed to one or other of the following circumstances:STATISTICAL RETURNS.

RESOLUTION( 2 ) of vaccinators working in Mufassal Municipalities and Dispensaries was less by sixteen, but the number of licensed vaccinators increased by forty-four. In- spection work was seriously affected by the fact that, from October to March, the three Deputy Sanitary Commissioners were employed on plague duty, while, for forty one days in the year, there was no Deputy Sanitary Commissioner of the Metropolitan Circle. 3. Number of operations and average per operator.( 3 ) Sanitary Commissioner believes that this practice is universal. Local officers have been instructed that stricter supervision must be exercised by the inspect- ing staff over the work of the licensed vaccinators, who do not understand the utility of entering all cases, whether successful or unsuccessful, and the Lieutenant-Governor hopes that the Civil Surgeons will devote greater attention to the matter. The introduction of the system in force- in the Panjab, of making three punctures in each arm, which was referred to in last year's Resolution, has been postponed, pending the re-organization of the Sanitary Department. 6. Secondary Operations.( 4 ) with the previous year. The increase in many districts is very considerable, and taking these figures in conjuction with the increased demand during the year for the lanoline vaccine paste manufactured at the Animal Vaccination Depots, Dr. Dyson expresses his belief that the arm-to-arm method of vaccina- tion in Bengal will soon be entirely superseded. He goes on to remark:ANNUAL STATISTICAL RETURNS AND SHORT NOTES ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL FOR THE YEAR 1897-98. BY SURGEON-MAJOR H. J. DYSON, F.R.C.S., Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal.

No. 4659. FROM SURGEON-MAJOR H. J. DYSON, F.R.C.S., Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Calcutta, the 22nd August 1898. SIR, Officer in charge of the Depart- ment. I HAVE the honour to submit, for the information of Government, the following short notes on vaccination in Bengal during the year 1897-98. 2. I was in charge of the Department through- out the year. In two out of the three circles into which Bengal is divided for the purposes of vaccination there were no Deputy Sanitary Commissioners or Superintendents of Vaccination during the greater part of the year, these officers having been recalled to military duty in connection with the frontier disturbances. During their absence the current duties of their offices were looked after by me in addi- tion to my own duties. The charge of the several circles was held as under:( 2 ) YEAR. INSPECTING STAFF.

( 6 ) Protection afforded to infants. 6. The following table shows in order of sequence the degree of protec- tion afforded to infants in the several districts of this Province, as compared with the preceding year, calculated as usual on an estimated birth-rate of 40 per mille:( 7 ) Out of 2,443,096, the estimated number of infants under one year available for vaccination, 508,615, or 208.18 per thousand, were successfully vaccinated, the corresponding figures for the preceding year being 2,435,905, 4,98,979 and 204.84 respectively. Malda, which last year stood second in the list, now heads it with nearly 984 children successfully vaccinated out of every 1,000 available. It is satisfactory to notice that both the highest and the lowest figure represent- ing the decree of protection afforded to infants, viz., 983.77 per mille in Malda and 54.39 in Patna, are considerably higher than the corresponding figures of the preceding year, viz., 876.89 and 37.49 in Darjeeling and Gaya respectively. There was an increase in this respect in 26 districts during the year under report, as compared with 37 during 1896-97. In this connection it may be mentioned here that orders are under issue for giving effect during the ensuing vaccination season to the recommendation I made in the Annual vaccination Report of 1895-96 in regard to six-point vaccination, as is done in Punjab, instead of the four points practised in Bengal. Revaccination. The following statement shows details of revaccinations by districts duringthe year under report, as contrasted with the preceding year:( 8 ) The percentage of successful revaccinations seems rather high. This appears to be due to a considerable extent to the large number of vaccinations among adults who had been vaccinated in their childhood, and in whose case the prophylactic power of the vaccine virus had completely gone.

( 13 ) Diagram illustrating death-rate from small- pox, and degree of protection afforded. 12. The following diagram illustrates the death-rates from small-pox in each district with side by side the proportion of popolation protected against the disease by vaccination during the past seven years :( 14 ) Animal Vaccination Depôts. 13. The following table shows the amount of work performed at theAnimal Vaccination Depôts during the year under review as compared with the preceding year;( 15 ) Compared with the preceding year there was a satisfactory increase of more than 25,000 in the number of primary vaccinations and over 5,000 in revaccinations performed direct from the calf. It will be seen that this method of vaccination has found great favour in Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Dacca, Mymensingh and Backergunge, the inhabitants of which are mostly Muham- madans, and in such backward districts as Lohardaga and Palamau. It is hoped that with the progress of time the prejudices of the Hindus against vaccination direct from the calf will gradually disappear. In accordance with the instructions of Government conveyed in their No. 5097S., dated the 30th November 1897, Civil Surgeons were asked to report fully through Magis- trates and Commissioners whether, having regard to the conditions prevailing in their districts, the character of the people, and the state of public feeling, steps can be taken to extend the practice of vaccination direct from the calf. There seems from the replies to be no objection to an extension of this system of vaccination in Burdwan, Midnapore, 24-Parganas, Jessore, Khulna, Nadia, Murshidabad, Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Rangpur, Bogra, Pabna, Mymensingh, Backergunge, Tippera, Noakhali, Chittagong, Sonthal Parganas, Cuttack and Balasore. In the remaining districts the objection to the introduction or a further extension of the measure is chiefly based on the religious prejudices of the people. Having regard to the state of public feeling at present in connection with plague measures, it is not expedient just now to make any attempt to extend the system of direct calf vaccination in places in which the measure is not readily acceptable to the people. Supply of lanoline lymph to Nipal. 15. Altogether 564 grains of lanoline vaccine paste were supplied to theNipal Darbar from the Darjeeling Animal Vaccin- ation Depôt during 1897-98. No returns of oper- ations performed with this lymph were suppliedexcept one, from which it appears that all the 25 cases (24 primary and1 re-vaccination) done with it proved very successful.

Muzaffarpur, which stood seventh last year, comes next with 65,847, being closely followed by Backergunge, Bhagalpur, Faridpur and Midnapore, with 62,625, 62,851, 61,747 and 59,913 inspections respectively. The great
( 20 ) variation in the amount of work performed by the Sub-Inspectors of the several districts, ranging from 86,489 in Mymensingh to 3,705 in Angul, is evidently due to the operation of one or more of the causes mentioned in last year's report. It is hoped that when the vaccination reorganization scheme comes into operation, under which Civil Hospital Assistants will take the place of the present Sub- Inspectors who are mostly unskilled, the outturn of work will be more satisfactory. 17.

DARJEELING, THE 8TH OCTOBER 1898. RESOLUTION( 2 ) Garden Reach. The appointment of one more head vaccinator in the Tribu- tary States accounts for the rise in the inspecting staff, and the entertainment of a number of paid vaccinators in the famine-stricken areas and of licensed vaccinators in some of the other districts, accounts for the increase in the number of operators. The number of vaccinators working in mufassal munici- palities and dispensaries fell off by eight. Inspection work was seriously affect- ed by the employment on plague duty of the Covenanted Deputy Sanitary Commissioners during the working season. 3. Number of Operations and Average per Operator.(3) the mortality among infants under one year of age, the total number of infants under one year available for vaccination is estimated at 2,443,096 against 2,460,228 in the preceding year ; and of these 508,615, or 208.18 per thousand, were vaccinated, as compared with 498,979, or 202.81 per thousand in 1896-97. As in the previous year, Malda, Darjeeling, and Lohardaga show the best results. Patna is at the bottom of the list, and Puri, Shahabad, Gaya and the Tributary States of Orissa also have very low percentages. The changes are small, and the differences remain enormous. The range in the proportion of the vacci- nation of infants born during the year is from 983 per mile in Malda to 54 in Patna, and these prodigious differences are constant. Why has vaccination become and continued so popular in Malda ? What can be done to establish it in Patna ? Why should Puri average about 75, while its neighbour of Balasore exceeds 200 ? These are obvious questions to which the Lieutenant- Governor can find no answer in the Sanitary Commissioner's memorandum, and he trusts that very special attention will be given to these backward districts to ascertain the causes of their hostility to vaccination and to settle the best methods of surmounting that hostility. All the three southern districts of the Patna Division require the Sanitary Commissioner's special regard and the serious co-operation of the Collectors. 5. Primary Operations.(4) of population protected by vaccination during the last seven years. It is interesting, but inconclusive. The death-rate from small-pox during the last seven years has been identical in the districts of Darjeeling, Rangpur, and Bogra, but in Darjeeling 6,000 of the 10,000 of the population are protected; in the other two districts the proportion is under 2,000. In Backergunge the percentage of protection is the same as in Rangpur and Bogra, but the propor- tion of small-pox mortality is 0.2 per mille against 2.0. Small-pox in Darjeel- ing may be abnormally fatal: in Backergunge abnormally mild; and the Lieutenant Governor would like to see such comparison as the trustworthiness of the older returns may permit between the mortality prior to the spread of vaccination in any district with that which prevailed before. In a district, for instance, like Malda, where nearly the whole of the infant population is habitually vaccinated, there ought to be evidence, which he who runs may read, of the value of the process in saving life. There is some evidence already. In Malda last year only one person died of small-pox. Let the enquiry and the comparison be carried further. It is by tangible evidence such as this that the suspicious mothers in the Patna Division will be won over. 11. Method of vaccination.( 5 ) No. 690T.
