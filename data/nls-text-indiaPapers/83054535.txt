REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES, FOR THE YEAR 1874. NAGPUR: PRINTED AT THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE PRESS. 1875. 6-7-75 o 81No. 2234/91 FROM LINDSAY NEILL, ESQUIRE, OFFG. ASST. SECURETARY TO THE CHIFF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Home Department Dated Nagpur, the 24th June 1875. SIR, I am directed by the Chief Commissioner to submit the reports on the Nagpur and Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylums, together with the prescribed statements and a resumé of their working, prepared by the Inspector General of Gaols and Dispensaries. 2. It has been customary hitherto for these reports to be appended to the annual Dispensary Report ; but in accordance with the instructions contained in paragraph 3 in your letter No. 542, dated 3rd December 1874, they are this year submitted separately. On the 1st January 1874 there were 235 inmates in the two institutions, of whom 183 were males and 52 females. The admissions were 90, viz., 72 males and 18 females ; 70 inmates were discharged during the year (males 55, females 15), of whom 47 are said to have been cured (males 40, females 7), and 23 (males 15, and females 8,) so much improved that they could with safety be made over to their relatives. At each asylum there were two escapes during the year; and at Jubbulpore one lunatic, a Madras sepoy, was transferred to Madras in the hope that restoration to his home might prove beneficial to his health. There were 28 deaths during the year (25 males and 3 females), and on the last day of the year there remained 222 under treatment, viz., 170 males and 52 females. 3. It seems a strange feature in the report that at the Jubbulpore Asylum so many more discharges of patients, either cured or relieved, should take place than at Nagpur. Thus Jubbulpore shows 34 persons discharged cured, against 13 shown at Nagpur ; and 19 persons so much improved as to be fit to be made over to their friends, against 4 at Nagpur. By turning to tables 6 and 7 " types of insanity" and " causes of insanity," the Chief Commissioner thought that some light might be thrown on the matter, but what an examination of the tables suggests, is, that there is a great difference in classification. For instance at Nagpur, Dr. Beatson recognises only 3 types of insanity, viz., Acute Mania, Chronic Mania, and Chronic Dementia ; and of the total number 152 treated, 66 were treated for Acute Mania, 71 for Chronic Mania, and 15 for Chronic De- mentia. Dr. Rice on the other hand classifies according to Acute Mania 35 cases, Chronic Mania 26, Melancholia 21, Acute Dementia 25, Chronic De- mentia 41, Idiotcy 16, Insipientia 9. Primâ facie it seems to the Chief Com- missioner unlikely that the total numbers being not out of proportion there should be at the Jubbulpore Asylum a greater variety of types of insanity than at the Nagpur institution. 4. Somewhat similar remarks apply to the table showing the alleged causes of insanity ; thus at Nagpur 53 cases are assigned to physical causes, at Jubbulpore 82 ; to moral causes at Nagpur 19, at Jubbulpore 47 ; to unknown 26-6-752 causes at Nagpur 80, at Jubbulpore 44. The question is a medical one, but seems worthy to the Chief Commissioner of notice. The cost of each lunatic, including extra-diet, clothing, medicines and contingencies was Rs. 90-12-6 at Nagpur, against Rs. 79-0-3 at Jubbulpore. The cost for sweepers at Nagpur seems large when compared with Jubbulpore, since as many sweepers were employed for a smaller number of patients and at almost double the monthly wages. In paragraph 24 of the resumé by the Inspector General of Gaols and Dispensaries some rather startling figures are given showing great differences on diet expenditure in the two institutions. The more startling figures are as follows : the average cost per head per annum for diet was at Nagpur Rs. 35-10-8, against Rs. 28-12-0 at Jubbulpore ; and the excess at Nagpur would seem due to a fuller scale of diet, and also to meat entering largely into the dietary. The cost of clothing was also very large at Nagpur. 5. It appears to the Chief Commissioner that the Inspector General of Gaols is the proper person for seeing that the diet scale should assimilate at both insti- tutions. There seems no reason why different scales should exist, and the Inspector General will be asked to consider the question and lay it with such information as he may get from the Superintendents before the official visitors of the institutions. 6. The earnings of the year are shown in paragraph 28 of the Inspector General's review for both institutions. At Jubbulpore some really good work in the way of building, &c., appears to have been done by the lunatics, and credit has been taken according to rates approved of by the Public Works Department after an inspection of the work. At Nagpur the Superintendent has continued farming and agriculture as an employment for the lunatics, and his profits do not show so well. The Chief Commissioner is disposed theoretically to agree in the opinion of Dr. Beatson that gardening and farming are the employments best suited to lunatics most of whom belong to cultivating classes ; but the fact remains that other kinds of works have been done at Jubbulpore with greater benefit to Government, more lunatics there have been discharged cured, more made over to their friends in an improved state, and the bill of mortality has also been less than at Nagpur. 7. In the last paragraph of Dr. Beatson's report he refers to the circumstance of a lunatic woman, who had for years past been an inmate of the asylum, having been delivered of a child in December last. This matter the Chief Commissioner has separately dealt with, and I am only now to say that the Chief Commissioner took advantage of that occurrence to impress on the official visitors of the two asylums, the necessity for greater activity in inspection and supervision. He believes that hitherto the visitors have hardly realized that they were responsible for the management of these institutions. An anomaly was found, in that the Superinten- dents of the two asylums were also visitors, but on the representation of the Chief Commissioner, the Brigadiers Commanding at Kamthi and Saugor were good enough to allow a Medical Officer under their control to be appointed a visitor, so that the anomaly of the Civil Surgeon being visitor of the institution of which he is the Superintendent has now ceased. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, LINDSAY NEILL, Offg. Asst. Secretary.
INDEX. CONDITION OF BUILDINGS. PARA. Nagpur,2 EMPLOYMENT. PARA. Lunatics chiefly employed on out-door labour ... 26 Difference in value of estinated labour inexplicable ... 27 EARNINGS. ProfitsReport on the working of the Lunatic Asylums in the Central Provinces during the year 1874. CONDITION OF BUILDINGS. Nothing of importance was executed in regard to buildings at Nagpur during the year, ordinary repairs only were carried out. The only new work taken in hand was the sinking of a well with a view to furnishing the asylum with a better supply of water, and also to bring a piece of land under cultiva- tion, hitherto of little value. The work is a good one and was much needed : it was undertaken by the Superintendent, and is being carried out in an economical manner partly by lunatics and partly with hired labour. 2. Dr. Beatson suggested in his report that the cost of masonry estimated at Rs. 400, since increased to Rs. 789-6-6 on a revised estimate, which included a grated covering, should be defrayed from the profits of the next harvest, but as the orders of Government prohibit drawing on receipts for expenditure, the Chief Commissioner has been moved to grant funds for the work. 3. The hospital and convalescent ward at Jubbulpore, commenced in 1873, has been put out of hand in that under review. The house consists of two rooms each 32'× 18'; a few artisans were employed on the work, the greater part of which was executed by lunatics. It cost Government but Rs. 477, which repre- sents the value of skilled labour, lime &c. Some condemned buildings belonging to the Municipality and to Government furnished Dr. Rice with bricks, wood, iron &c., these items cost nothing in actual cash, lunatics removed the materials to site, 4. The hospital is of very neat design, it looks well, and the Chief En- gineer has pronounced it " well done." I may add that this success is due to the constant supervision exercised by the Superintendent over one of his pet jobs; the plan and specification will be found attached to the report for 1873. 5. Some unsightly sheds that existed in front of the main building were in course of removal at the close of the year. The old Najjib lines have given place to a well laid out vegetable garden, All these works have been executed by lunatics. 6. I visited the asylum in January and was well pleased with all I saw ; the official visitors have expressed their approval of its management. NUMBER OF LUNATICS CONFINED AND ACCOMMODATION. 7. The daily average number in the asylums in 1874 was as under :2 Males. Main dormitory, 789 superficial feet=15.7 patients, or say 16 No. 2 431 3 a large sloughing ulcer, 1 had phthisis, 3 were epileptics, 1 was very vio- lent, the remaining 12 were noted on admission as all more or less broken down by advancing age or bodily disease; 3 were criminal lunatics. 12. At Jubbulpore 4 died from dysentery, 2 from consumption, 1 from fever, and 1 from a wound; 4 of these were in very bad health on admission to the asylum, 2 were in indifferent health and 2 were in good health. Of the total number (52) admitted to the asylum last year 11 were in good health, 21 were in fair health, and 21 were in bad health. Similar details are not given as regards the Nagpur patients. 13. Dr. Rice attaches some importance to the manner in which incipient disease is searched for; thus persons suffering from trivial complaints are treated in hospital partly on the "stitch in time" principle, and partly because many of these unfortunates are unable to make their wants known; possibly this may account for the high daily average sick at Jubbulpore, 16.54, compared with that at Nagpur, 3.27. The low state of health on admission to the asylum Dr. Rice disposes of thus: " This is not to be wondered at when it is considered that these creatures are incapable of earning a livelihood, don't know how to shelter, clothe or feed themselves, and are often subjected to ill usage, chiefly through the apathy or ignorance of their relatives or friends." CRIMINAL LUNATICS. 14. The daily average number of criminal lunatics at Nagpur was 13.22 males and no females; at Jubbulpore there were 4.50 males and 275 females, or 7.25 in all. RELIGION, OCCUPATION AND AGE. 15. The religion of new admissions is thus given: Hindus. Mohammadans. Christians. Nagpur ... 30 6 2 = 38 Jubbulpore ... 48 4 0 = 52 16. Cultivators furnished the majority of admissions to both asylums, proba- bly because this class is a numerous one; shopkeepers and beggars are also a numerous class, but, as stated in a previous report, the friendless wanderers picked up by the police are returned as beggars in the absence of information regarding their antecedents. 17. Only 2 were admitted under 20 years into each asylum; 29 were ad- mitted at Nagpur and 45 at Jubbulpore between the ages of 20 and 40: at Nagpur 7 and at Jubbulpore 5 were admitted whose ages exceeded 40. CLASSIFICATION OF MANIA AND ITS CAUSES. 18. The whole of the admissions into the Nagpur Asylum are returned under acute mania: they have been thus classified at Jubbulpore, acute mania 13, chronic mania 6, acute dementia 8, chronic dementia 10, idiotcy 10, melancholia 4, and 1 laboring under the first symptoms of insanity. The reports do not afford any clue to an explanation of the difference in classification at both asylums.
4 19. As in previous years, to an abuse of ganja is ascribed insanity in about half the number of cases,5 23. The next item in which Nagpur is in excess is diet or the difference be- tween Rs. 35-10-8 and Rs. 28-12-0 per lunatic per annum. Grain as wheat and rice was cheaper at Nagpur than at Jubbulpore, yet the cost of those articles at the former exceeded that of the latter; possibly a more liberal diet scale exists at Nagpur, the report does not afford the necessary information and the nature of the diet rolls renders a comparison very difficult if not impossible. 24. Meat at Nagpur cost about five times as much as at Jubbulpore, fire- wood more than double; the following table will best explain the items :6 28. The earnings of the year were as under: DR. NAGPUR.

These sums are not intended to represent actual cash earnings or profits, but what has been saved by substituting lunatic for hired labour. 30. The reports submitted by Doctors Beatson and Rice, with the sets of statements recently prescribed, are herewith forwarded. 31. Dr. Beatson closes his report with a few remarks regarding an idiot who gave birth to a child in December; the circumstances of the event have been already before the Chief Commissioner, and need no further remark in this place.

7 Annual Report of the Nagpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1874. Table I. shows that at the close of the year 1873, 88 males and 26 females remained under treatment. During 1874, 33 males and 5 females were admitted, giving a total treated of 121 males and 31 females,8 Table VIII. shows the admissions into hospital for sickness, and the num- ber discharged cured, and died. The daily average number of sick was never large, being only 3.27, but the mortality was about twice as great as the average of the preceding 9 years, owing chiefly to three causes :9 has continued to perform his duties with his usual care and attention to the wel- fare of the lunatics. I regret to be obliged to report an untoward circumstance, which may be thought to indicate lax or imperfect supervision. A young idiotic woman who has been several years in the asylum became pregnant and was delivered of a child towards the end of December. I had frequently noticed this patient, who had a habit of exposing her limbs very freely, and I frequently gave orders for her being carefully watched, although I apprehended little danger from the male patients,ANNUAL STATEMENTS.

There remained in the asylum on the 1st January 1874, 121 lunatics (males 95, females 26. ) of these 8 (males 5, females 3) were criminal lunatics. There were admitted 52: of these 39 were males and 13 females; 3 of these were re-admissions, viz. 2 who had been discharged under the impression they were cured ; they were in the asylum, one for 4½ years, and the other for 11 months, and for several months seemed quite sane, but, whether from poor food and gen- eral ill-usage, or from a simple re-accession of the malady, they soon became again insane, and when re-admitted had become very much thinner and weaker than when discharged; the third was a criminal lunatic, discharged for the purpose of being tried. Of the males 3 were criminal lunatics; the females were all non- criminal. Thus the total number of individuals who passed through the asylum during the year amounted to 173, against 176 for the year preceding. The average population was 115.22, against 122.93 for the year preceding : of these the daily average strength of females was 28.6l against 25.86 for 1873 ; of males it was 86.61, against 97.07. 34 (males 29, females 5,) were discharged cured, against 32 for the year preceding ; 19 (males 12, females 7) were discharged after a more or less lengthened residence in the asylum, so much improved that they may with safety be entrusted to the care of their friends, who were willing and able to look after them; two absconded; and one, a sowar in the Madras Cavalry, was transferred to the asylum at Madras, with a hope that restoration to his home and intercourse with people, with whose habits, manners, customs and language he was familiar, would afford at all events the best chance of restoration of his reason. 8 died (males 7, female 1) against 17 for the year preceding. Thus leav- ing under treatment on the 31st December, 109 (males 83, females 26). BODILY SICKNESS AND MORTALITY. I should premise that I have made it an established rule in the asylum that lunatics who may be ailing should be searched for, and brought to the hos- pital without waiting for them to complain; every member of the establishment is taken to task if he is caught neglecting this, so seriously, that lunatics are brought up for the most trifling ailments. The consequence is that, owing to this precaution chiefly, the number treated in hospital is large, larger than at Nag- pur for instance; another reason is that, for natives especially, if from any cause they have contracted a serious illness, Jubbulpore is a more unhealthy locality than Nagpur. I should add that a good deal of the sickness is due to lunatics having been sent to the asylum very much exhausted from chronic disease, chiefly of the bow- els, but on occasions, from diseases of the lungs, ulcers and syphilis also. Of the total number who died (8) it is recorded that 4 were in "very bad health" when admitted, 2 were in " indifferent health," and only 2 in good health. Fur- ther, of the total number admitted into the asylum (52), only 11 were pronounced 5-7-75 Q K 69 247
18 in good bodily health on arrival, 21 in fair health, and 20 very bad indeed. This is not to be wondered at when it is considered that these creatures are incapable of earning a livelihood, don't know how to shelter, clothe or feed themselves, and are often subjected to ill-usage, chiefly through the apathy or ignorance of their relatives or friends. For these reasons the number treated in hospital is large, and represents a greater amount of sickness than would be the case if a different system were pur- sued. I do not think that the wards are unwholesome, especially since the in- tersecting walls have been replaced by railings, the roofs provided with ventila- tors and verandahs built. The site is now very much more open since the old Thaggi Najib lines and the village attached to them have been removed. There is much to be said for the system I refer to; to my mind every thing is in its favour. We do not expect those people to work as prisoners, therefore the State suffers no loss by keeping them in hospital. Lunatics have not the wit to complain of their own accord when sick, and they in particular need to have their ailments treated early, as in them disease is rapidly destructive. A " small sore " or a " boil" may degenerate into a sloughing ulcer, and a "com- mon cold" may run into insidious pneumonia, when in people who are sound in mind as well as in body, they would end as they began. 182 cases were treated in hospital. The principal diseases consisted of:19 EMPLOYMENT. The lunatics were employed chiefly in levelling old buildings, with the materials of which they constructed the new hospital and convalescent wards, capable of accommodating 28 patients and 7 keepers; also 2 latrines, one for males and one for females. They took down the old Thaggi Najib lines and the village attached to it; they levelled the site and laid it out for a garden, to be cultivated from the beginning of next rains; they planted over 700 running yards of Mehndi hedges round the premises, and excavated 24,000 cubic feet of earth-work in terracing the site of the new hospital. In Table No. 12 is a detailed statement of the work done; it was measured and valued by an Overseer of the Department of Public Works. It amounted in value to Rs. 4,338, for which a cash outlay of Rs. 477 was paid by Government, leaving a net profit of Rs. 3,861 for work20 There was no occasion to place a lunatic in solitary confinement for more than 16 hours at a time; and the only restraint commonly used consisted in locking unruly or violent patients into a large ward. My visits to the asylum were made daily, and, after a close search for it, I have never been able to ascertain that a lunatic was ill-used by any of the officials. It is due to the Establishment that I should place this on record. It may be said that the foregoing remarks are no more than my own opi- nions, but in reality they are a summary of those recorded by the official visi- tors, at each of their monthly visitations, and of those formed by the Inspector General of Jails and the Deputy Surgeon General; the latter officer was a frequent and unexpected visitor during the year, and at all times expressed him- self as well satisfied in respect of all the points above referred to.

REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES, FOR THE YEAR 1875. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] NAGPUR: PRINTED AT THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE PRESS. 1876. 26 6 76 i 1No. 2421/109 FROM LINDSAY NEILL, ESQ., OFFG. ASST. SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Home Department. Dated Nagpur, the 28th June 1876. SIR, I am directed by the Chief Commissioner to submit the Annual Re- ports and Statements on the working of the Lunatic Asylums at Nagpur and Jubbulpore during the year 1875, together with a resumé by the Inspector Gen- eral of Gaols and Dispensaries. 2. The principal figures are, that on the 1st January 1875 there were in the Nagpur Asylum 113 inmates (87 males, 26 females), and in the Jubbulpore one 109 (83 males, 26 females) ; that during the year the new admissions and re- admissions at Nagpur were 38 (32 males and 6 females), and at Jubbulpore 62 (46 males 16 females) ; so that the total number in the Nagpur Asylum was 151, and at Jubbulpore 171. At Nagpur 19 patients, (18 males, 1 female) were discharged cured, and at Jubbulpore 11 (10 males, 1 female); 5 patients (3 males, 2 females) were made over at Nagpur to their friends in an improved condition, and 15 at Jubbulpore (9 males, 6 females), besides which 3 patients are shown at Nagpur as otherwise dis- posed of, 2 of these being transferred elsewhere, and 1 having escaped. There were 10 deaths at Nagpur (8 males, 2 females), and 2 at Jubbulpore (1 male, 1 female) ; and at the close of the year the Nagpur Asylum had 114 inmates (89 males, 25 females), and Jubbulpore 143 (109 males 34 females). The only other remark which Statement 1 seems to call for is, that there was no overcrowding at either institution during the year, and that while the number of deaths at Jubbulpore was very much less than at Nagpur, the percentage of daily average sick was much greater at the former institution. Why this should be so is perhaps explained by the fact that at Jubbulpore bodily ailments amongst lunatics are sought for, it not being left to them to bring their ailments to notice. 3. Statements 3 4 and 5 do not seem to call for much notice. The luna- tics received into the asylum are chiefly males, as to religion they are mainly Hindus ; the greater number are between 20 and 40 years of age, and their occupation does not present anything of interest. 4. In his last year's review the Chief Commissioner made some remarks regarding the classification of patients as exhibited in Statement 6. This state- ment shows the types of insanity, and it seemed to the Chief Commissioner some- what strange that the types should not assimilate at the two asylums. The Chief Commissioner now observes that Surgeon Major Brake in paragraph 17 of his resumè says ;2 "of diagnosis. The Superintendent at Nagpur includes all his patients under 33 were purchased occasionally at the rates given in the ordinary price-currents and not unfrequently at cheaper rates, but that at Nagpur, the Superintendent in many instances purchased at rates in excess of those quoted in the price-currents. This in a letter to the Officiating Inspector General of Gaols he explained as follows:4 the existence and action of the Committee of Management. The Chief Com- missioner from Proceedings of the Committee of Management in March 1876, first learnt that the prevalence of bowel complaints in the Lunatic Asylum was ascribed to defective clothing, and that a pattern of a proper kind had been made up by the Superintendent. The Chief Commissioner hastened to ask why clothing had been allowed to become " defective, " and he then learnt that the blankets only had been considered insufficient, either in size or warmth. This matter of their insufficiency should have been brought to the notice of the Com- mittee forthwith, and as soon as it was brought it was rectified. 8. On Statement 9, the Chief Commissioner has no comments to offer. Both at Jubbulpore and Nagpur the Superintendents have exacted from the lunatics a fair amount of work, 9. The Chief Commissioner is glad to be able to say that the inspection of the Asylums by the Committees of Management has been more frequent, and their control more vigorous than in previous years. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, LINDSAY NELL, Offg.. Asst. Secretary. 26 6 76 Q 11 250

FROM SURGEON-MAJOR JOHN BRAKE, INSPECTOR GENERAL OF DISPENSARIES AND LUNATIC ASYLUMS, Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 31st May 1876. SIR, I have the honor to forward the report and figured statements for the year 1875 as received from the Superintendents of the Nagpur and Jubbul- pore Lunatic Asylums. Buildings2 Discharges. 6. The discharges were :3 Occupation. 14. The classes from which lunatics have been received are thus given :4 The very large proportion of unknown causes renders a close comparison impossible. Ganja smoking, as generally acknowledged, is the most fertile source of mental diseases. Admissions to hospital. 19. At Nagpur the admissions to hospital were 114. Jubbulpore 5 Nagpur has 2 male and 1 female keeper more, 1 gardener more, 1 sweeper less but on higher pay, 1 barber and 1 dhobi on low rates of pay. At Nagpur the Lunatic Asylum is at the extreme end of the station, far away from any other dispensary. There are daily applications to the Deputy Superintendent in charge for medicines and advice, and the Lunatic Asylum dis- pensary is virtually used as a general local dispensary for one part of Sitabaldi and for villages near ; a compounder is therefore considered necessary. The Deputy Superintendent attends to the office work, and the duffadar, an old and experienced servant, is supposed to take charge of the lunatics whilst the De- puty Superintendent is so employed. The duffadar and compounder thus take the place of a writer, and cost Rs. 2 per month more. The next excees of 2 male and 1 female keeper and 1 gardener is explained by the difference in the character of the two Asylums and employment of lunatics. At Jubbulpore the Asylum is enclosed, the garden near, and no work carried on beyond the pre- cincts. At Nagpur the grounds are open with only hedges in certain directions. The lunatics, excepting a few kept within their wards, are all employed outside on the farm or in the gardens, and the warders and keepers are not in excess of requirements. The cost of dhobi and barber at Jubbulpore are included in contingencies. Diet. 24. On the subject of high cost for diet a correspondence took place be- tween the Officiating Inspector General and the Superin- tendent of the Nagpur Asylum towards the close of the year in October and November, consequent upon the remarks of the Government of India on the Asylum Report for 1874. The Superintendent stated that many of the articles consumed could not be procured at the published rates, and that his scale of dieting was liberal in accordance he believed with the wishes of Go- vernment, as expressed in Book Circular No. XVIII, dated 6th April 1866. At the present time, however, supplies are given at the rates published, and it is be- lieved that the accounts of the current year will compare favourably with those of the year under review. Clothing. 25. The cost of clothing at Jubbulpore in 1874 was particularly low, Rs. 1-10-0 per head6 If the result of useful labour performed by the lunatics may be considered under the head of " savings" then in addition to the Rs. 65-10-0 there should be added for lunatic labor at Nagpur in lieu of7 Annual Report of the Nagpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1875, by Surgeon Major W.

REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES, FOR THE YEAR 1876. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] NAGPUR: PRINTED AT THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE PRESS. 1877.
No. 2722/129 FROM A. H. L. ERASER, ESQ. OFFG. ASST. SECRETARY.TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Home Department. Dated Nagpur, the 13th July 1877. SIR, I am directed to submit the annual reports of the Nagpur and Jubbul- pore Lunatic asylums with the usual statements and a resumé by the Inspector General of Jails. It will be noted that Doctor Brake held charge of the Nag- pur asylum for the last nine months of the year ; while Doctor Beatson, who writes the report, only held charge during the first three months. Doctor Rice was the whole year in charge of the Jubbulpore asylum. Statement 1. 2, The daily average population in the two institutions shows a slight decrease at Nagpur, being 117.50 in 1876, against 119.90 for the preceding year. A slight increase, due not to admis- sions, which have been much fewer this year, but to the large number remaining on January 1st, took place at Jubbulpore : the figures being 133.37 against 131.87 of the preceding year. There has been no overcrowding ; for the accom- modation in both asylums is, as shown in the foot note to Statement I, consider- ably above that required by the largest number of lunatics confined on any one night during the year. 3. The total number of patients in the Nagpur asylum was 147, of whom 5 were cured, and 6 made over to their friends in improved health. In the Jubbulpore asylum, out of 179 patients, 18 were cured, and 30 made over to their friends. The results at Jubbulpore, therefore, appear much more favourable than those at Nagpur ; but it is impossible accurately to judge of them, in the absence of any explanation of the marked differences recorded in the state- ments. Statement 8. 4. The deaths among the patients numbered precisely the same as last year, being 12 at Nagpur and 2 at Jubbulpore ; while the number of sick at the latter institution was again larger than at the former. The most common forms of disease were, at Nagpur, fever, diarrh2 he gives the cases treated as 156, while the total number of patients was only 147. Statement 7. 6. The alleged causes of insanity are, as Doctor Rice points out, always open to doubt. But the broad conclusions may probably with safety be accepted, that of moral causes, grief is the most common, that more cases result from physical than from moral causes, and that of these physical causes, by far the most prevalent is the use of ganja.

The annual expenditure per head has decreased in a marked degree in Nagpur, and slightly increased in Jubbulpore. The figures for the two years may with advantage be compared. The table given in the margin shows that, while there has been a slight increase at Jubbulpore under the heading "Diet," due, it is said, to the rise in cereals towards the end of the year, in consequence of exporta- tion to the famine districts, yet in Nagpur, where the same circums- tances existed, the average cost of diet has decreased by one-sixth. This marked decrease strongly corroborates the statements (re- garding the general laxity of su-pervision on the part of the De- puty Superintendent, resulting in peculation and fraud by his subordinates) con- tained in Doctor Brake's minute, an extract from which is given at page 8 of the report ; and these figures and statements also confirm the Chief Commissioner's opinion, expressed in reviewing last year's report,* that the former high rate of expenditure was simply due to want of good management. 8. It will be noted that the high charge shown in the above table for con- tingencies at Jubbulpore, is due to the fact that the cost of building a house for the Deputy Superintendent and of sinking a well, has been debited to that head. 9. The Chief Commissioner does not consider it necessary to notice any more of the figures contained in the statements herewith submitted. In conclu- sion I am to say, that, judging from these reports and from the minutes of inspections made by the Committees of management, Mr. Morris considers that the results of the year under report are fairly satisfactory. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, A. H. L. FRASER, Offg. Asst Secretary.
Report on the working of the Lunatic Asylums in the Central Provinces, during the year 1876, by Lieutenant-Colonel E. M.

The causes of insanity, however, are put forward with less certainty by Dr. Rice. The reports showed that the following are the reasons assigned in respect of each of the institutions :5 Deputy Superintendent, resulting in peculation and fraud by the subordinate servants, so that the wretched lunatics did not receive the food which was intended for them. 21. Doctor Beatson, in commenting on Doctor Brake's minute, admits, at least to a certain extent, the correctness of the statement made as to the physical condition of the lunatics ; for he says in his report " when I made over charge in April there was more sickness and debility than usual." He improperly attempts to defend the Deputy Superintendent, and to throw the blame, as regards these grave irregularities, on his official superiors, who had, according to his statement, put pressure as to reduction of expenditure in such a way, that the reduction of diet to the lunatics was a necessary consequence, and that extreme reduction by the Deputy Superintendent was a mere error of judgment. But the unfairness of this is self-evident, for in the first place the pressure that was put on him was not to reduce the scale of diet, but the rates at which the expenditure was incurred ; and in the second place, Doctor Brake bears testimony to the fact that the " diet was ample as issued and paid for," but that he " had grave suspicion that the lunatics did not receive their proper quantity." 22. Doctor Brake took prompt measures, as explained by him, to remedy the evils which existed, and it is to be hoped that the present year will show very different results. Expenditure. 23. The following table shows the expenditure under the several heads of the two asylums in juxtaposition :6 at the close of the year the " clothing was in a most deficient condition.' Explanation has been called for from the Superintendent. Establishment. 25. Statement No. 10 shows the strength of each establishment as it stood on the last day of the year. These are the same in point of numbers as in the year previous, but the aggregate cost of each is less. In Nagpur, because the Deputy Superintendent is now a 2nd Class Hospital Assistant on Rs. 40, instead of as formerly a 1st class man on Rs. 60. In Jubbulpore the allowance of Rs. 15 a month to the Deputy Super- intendent as house-rent has been saved since the house on the premises was finished. Profits. 26. There is no means of ascertaining the actual value of the labour performed by the lunatics, and therefore no estimate of profit can be reliable. Doctor Rice gives the profit in Statement 11 as Rs. 1,651-2-9 ; whilst Doctor Beatson only shows Rs. 72-11-7. As Doctor Beatson remarks the work done is chiefly of a nature difficult to appraise, such as road- making, gardening, and the like, but which would amount to a considerable sum in the shape of wages. 27. At Nagpur the Committee of management have made regular visits of inspection, minutes of which have from time to time been sent to the Chief Commissioner.
7 Annual Report of the Nagpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1876. STATEMENT No. I.8 STATEMENT No. VIII.9 When I made over charge in April last there was more sickness and debility than usual, owing to the reasons already detailed ; but looking at the num- ber of deaths, and the causes of mortality, and comparing them with other years, I cannot think that the year has been one of very severe or immoderate sickness. The rate of mortality is not I think high for a Lunatic Asylum. I have had all the inmates repeatedly under review since my return to Nagpur, and I find in their general appearance no remarkable alteration, either for the better or the worse. Clothing was in a most deficient condition. With the sanction of the visitors, arrangements are now being made as speedily as possible for its renewal. Second Class Hospital Assistant Abdoolmajeed Khan has been only recently appointed Deputy Superintendent, and I am therefore unable to speak fully of his qualifica- tions for the post. He appears, however, to be very energetic, and anxious to do his duty ; he has already had experience in the Jubbulpore Asylum, and I can therefore have no doubt that he will be of very great assistance in the future management of the Nagpur institution.

REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES, FOR THE YEAR 1877. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] NAGPUR: PRINTED AT THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE PRESS. 1878.
No. 2093/104 FROM A. H. L. FRASER, ESQUIRE, ASST. SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. To THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OF PRISONS &c., Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 4th June 1878. SIR, I am directed to acknowledge your letter No. 2186, dated 17th ultimo, submitting an amalgamated set of the prescribed statements for the two Lunatic Asylums of this Province, with a brief report on the working of these institutions. 2. The population of the Nagpur Asylum was 161, showing an increase of 10 as compared with the preceding year ; but this is almost entirely due to the larger number remaining under treatment at the beginning of the year under review. Of the patients, 17 were cured, 8 were transferred to friends, 2 escaped, 5 died, and 129 remained on December 31st. In Jubbulpore, although there was an increase of 8 in the admissions and re-admissions, the total population was 7 less than last year. Of the 172 inmates, 17 were cured, 6 were transfer- red to friends, 1 escaped, 3 died and 145 remained in the Asylum at the close of the year. The results for the two institutions have therefore been very similar, the figures for Nagpur being much more satisfactory than those of the preceding year. 3. There was no overcrowding in either Asylum ; but, if Dr. Rice's view of the real capacity of the Jubbulpore building be correct, the maximum number confined in any one night during the year was only two short of the maximum number which can be entertained with safety to health. The daily average of sick in Nagpur was rather less than for the preceding year. But it was much higher than in Jubbulpore, where it fell from 7.17 to 1.64. No ex- planation is given of the much higher figures for Nagpur. The year generally was a healthy one ; and none of the diseases were of an unusual type. 4. It is note-worthy that of the 38 admissions to the Nagpur Asylum, 16 were from the Nagpur district; and of the 44 Jubbulpore admissions, 21 were from the district of Jubbulpore. Dr. Rice's comment on this latter fact is sug- gestive. It is to be hoped that the restrictions prescribed in Book Circular XXXI. of 1877, with which were circulated recent orders of the Government of India regarding the admission of lunatics into Asylums, may check the un- necessary transmission of insanes to these institutions, and so reduce the average number of patients. These orders are noticed by Dr. Rice in the remarks quoted in your paragraph 8. The Chief Commissioner generally concurs in these remarks. A dispensary is the best place for the treatment and observation of doubtful cases. 5. The Chief Commissioner does not consider it necessary to add much to your remarks (contained in paragraphs 92 Diet. 1876 1877 R. a. p. R. a. p. Nagpur 30-4-8 31-14-4. Jubbulpore 28-6-4 27-14-9. No. 2186. FROM COLONEL E. M. PLAYFAIR, OFFG. INSPECTOR GENERAL OF PRISONS, &c. Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpu, the 17th May 1878. SIR, I have the honor to submit an amalgamated set of the prescribed annual statements required for the two Lunatic Asylums of this Province, and to report briefly on the working of these institutions. Statement 1. Population. 2. The total population of the Nagpur asylum was 161 (128 males and 33 females); and of Jubbulpore 172 (134 males and 38 females). Thus for Nagpur the figures are higher both for male and female patients than they ever previously have been in any one year since the establishment of the asylum ; whilst in Jubbulpore the population remains much the same as for the past 5 years, the admissions and re-admissions in both institutions being slightly in excess of 1876. Discharges. 3. In the Nagpur asylum 27 patients (22 males and 5 females) were dis- charged, of whom 17 were cured, 6 in an improved con- dition were made over to the care of their friends, as also 1 male and 1 female, who though not improved, were harmless. Two males dis- charged themselves by escape and have not subsequently been captured. In Jubbulpore the figures show a total of discharge 24 (19 males and 5 females) ; 17 as cured absolutely, 5 as improved, and one a harmless imbecile, made over to their friends, whilst one who escaped has not been re-admitted. Deaths. 4. 5 deaths occurred at Nagpur and 3 at Jubbul- pore, the former being very much below the mortality of any one year since 1868. Patients remaining at close of year. 5. The number of patients remaining at the close of the year was :2 afforded as to why there should be so much larger a proportion of sick at Nagpur, the health of the outside population being there so much better than at Jubbulpore. Statement No. 2. Criminal lunatics. 7. Treats of Criminal lunatics, and of this class there has been a large increase during the past year, principally in the Jubbul- pore asylum. The numbers at the close of last year and the one previous being as follows:3 nution of mental power and by a muscular paralysis which gradually increases and invades the whole muscular system, while the mental derangement is generally marked by an exaggerated feeling of personal power and importance. It is usually, though not always, rapidly fatal, most cases running their course in about two years. The case in point is one of simple chronic mania in an old man who was admitted ten years ago, and who has been for the last three years crippled in his lower extremities by rheumatism. During the last month of the year all cases have been carefully examined and re-diagnosed, and the resulting changes will be shown in the report of the following year. The two cases returned as "not insane" are criminals acquitted on the ground of insa- nity but considered to be sane when replaced in the asylum. The majority of recoveries were as usual from acute mania." Statement No. 7. Assigned causes of insanity. 11. As usual, the cause assigned for every particular case of insanity must be accepted as open to much question, and this statement can only be said to show approximately the real figures under the different heads. What Dr. Beatson says as to difficulty in filling up this statement has doubtless much weight:4 little or nothing expended under the head of clothing. Besides this, as Dr. Beatson remarks, clothing in an asylum is " prematurely worn out by the dirty and destructive habits of some of the patients." Contingencies. Contingencies in both asylums show a decrease ; in Jubbulpore this is very great, as during the past year no building operations requiring outlay for material were being carried on. Statement No. 10. Establishments. 14. The cost of the establishments in both asylums is almost the same. At Jubbulpore, washing and shaving is charged in monthly contingent bills; whereas in Nagpur the dhoby and barber are paid servants of the institution. The actual cost of the two establishments should beSTATEMENTS.

[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] NAGPUR: PRINTED AT THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE PRESS. 1879. 17-6-79 5-C.No. 2588/126 FROM A. H. L. ERASER, ESQUIRE. ASST. SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. To THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OF PRISONS, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 17th June 1879. SIR, I am directed to acknowledge your letter No. 2737, dated 23rd ultimo, being the annual report on the working of the Nagpur and Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylums for the year 1878. Statement I. 2. Statement I. shows that the admissions and readmissions have been much fewer than in 1877, being 30 in Nagpur and 23 in Jubbulpore,against 38 and 44 respectively. Yet, owing to the larger number remaining in each institution on the 1st of January 1878, the total population of the two institutions is much the same as last year. In the Nagpur Asylum, the total population was 159, the daily average strength 125.14, and the maximum number of lunatics confined in any one night 131. In the Jubbulpore Asylum, the figures were 168, 134.19, and 146 respectively. As these institutions are stated to be capable of accommodating (at the rate of 50 superficial feet per patient) 155 and 161 patients respectively, there has been no overcrowding. 3. In the Nagpur Asylum 13 lunatics were cured ; and 9 were made over to their friends as "improved," and 4 as "not improved." In the Jubbulpore Asylum 25 were cured, and 10 were "improved." Treatment of the patients would appear therefore to have been more successful in the latter institution. The daily average of sick at Nagpur was 5.19 as against 5.48 for 1877, and at Jubbulpore 4.60 as against 1.64. But in explanation of the great increase at the latter institution it must be borne in mind that the figure for 1877 was exception- ally low. The mortality at the two institutions has been about equal in propor- tion to the total population. The number of inmates remaining at the close of this year was considerably lower than at the close of last year. Statement II. 4. The number of criminal lunatics was practically the same as in 1877. The case of Dina alluded to in your 3rd paragraph is peculiar. He was transferred from the asylum to the Central Jail in consequence of the Superintendent of the Asylum expressing his opinion that his insanity was feigned. The Superintendent of the Jail, on the contrary, reported that, after careful observation, he considered his insanity real. He based this opinion on the revolting character of some of the " strange antics" of the prisoner, and perhaps even more strongly on his confirmed sleeplessness, which the Superintendent does not consider he could have feigned. The Chief Commissioner has accordingly directed his readmission to the asylum for treat- ment. Statement III. 5. Statement III. gives the religion, sex and residence of the patients admitted during the year. The figures do not call for comment, except in respect to the fact that one-third of the admissions to the Nagpur Asylum, and more than one-half of those to the 186 792 Jubbulpore Asylum, are from the district in which the institution is situated. Last year Dr. Rice suggested that perhaps the proximity of the asylum led to patients being too readily sent to it; and Dr. Browne in his report again draws attention to this matter, but further explains that the Central Jail supplies criminal lunatics who are credited to the district. It would be well to ascertain by the observation of particular cases, whether patients are unnecessarily for- warded to these institutions from adjacent localities. Statements IVNo. 2737. FROM LIEUTENANT-COLONEL J. L. LOCH, OFFG. INSPECTOR GENERAL OF PRISONS, Central Provinces. To, THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 23rd May 1879. SIR, In forwarding herewith, in amalgamated form, Statements I. to XI. of the Nagpur and Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylums for 1878, I have the honor to submit the following report on the working of these institutions. Statement No. I. Admissions. 2. At the Nagpur Asylum 25 males and 5 females were admitted during the year as opposed to 31 males and 7 females in 1877. At Jubbulpore they number 19 males and 4 females as contrasted with 38 males and 6 females in 1877, the decrease being probably the effect of the restriction put upon the admission of insanes into Asylums by Book Circular No. XXXI. of 1877. 3. The figures for 1878 given above for the Nagpur institution include 2 males and 1 female re-admitted, The first was a criminal lunatic, named Dina, twice received from the Nagpur Jail, who, Dr. Brake reports, must have feigned insanity while in jail, as he is inclined to play strange antics when he finds him- self to be watched in the asylum. Since his return to the Nagpur Jail he has again been recommended for transfer, and the question is now pending.* The second is a criminal Danu, who had been sent to Raipur and returned thence owing to some misconception of the section under which he was confined. The third is a non-criminal female, released as harmless and able to support herself, but brought back the succeeding month by the Police. 4. There were no re-admissions at the Jubbulpore Asylum. 5. Notwithstanding the fewer admissions the total population was much the same in 1878 as in 1877, the decrease at Nagpur being 1 male and 1 female, and at Jubbulpore 3 males and 1 female. This is due to the high numbers brought forward from the previous year. Discharges. 6. At. Nagpur 27 patients (21 males and 6 females) were discharged, being the same in the aggregate as the year previous. Of this number 13 were cured, 9 improved, 4 not improved, 1 otherwise, that is to say, one man escaped and has not since been heard of.2 the deaths that occurred during the four years preceding. The average daily sick, however, at Nagpur has fallen from 5.48 to 5.14, while in Jubbulpore it has risen from 1.64 to 4. 60. Remaining. 8. The number remaining at close of the year at both institutions stands thus:3 For Jubbulpore the proportion stands thus :4 proper information. Hence the histories must commonly contain under canse, duration, whether first attack, &c., the satisfactory answer " unknown." This is corrected by me as far as possible by subsequent enquiries from the patient if cohe- rent answers can be obtained, or from relatives if such can be found. There can be little doubt that amongst the physical causes, the indulgence in ganja is by far the most fertile source of disease. Those who take spirits and opium often take ganja too. Fevers and inflammatory disease of the membranes are frequently followed by impairment of the faculties of the brain, and puerperal disturbances also give rise to more or less persistent brain derangement ' Amongst the moral causes, excessive study, excitement from loss of children or of property, give examples in the present return; and two at least of those admitted had exalted ideas upon religious subjects, but whether as cause or effect it would be difficult to say." Statement No. VIII. Sickness and mortality. 22. The sickness at Nagpur has been greater than at Jubbulpore, but the mortality less. At Nagpur the number of patients admitted into hospital in 1878 exceed by far the admissions of 1877, the figures being 125 and 68 respectively ; and the reason urged is that '' the year appears to have been unhealthy here as elsewhere." At Jubbulpore the increase has been from 26 in 1877 to 88 in 1878, and, although no explanation is offered by the Superintendent, it may I think be assumed that at Jubbulpore also the season was less favourable to health, this fact being corroborated by the rise in the sick and death rates of the Jubbulpore Jail. At Nagpur the most common diseases were ague, fever, an5 value of vegetables, supplied to lunatics under the inter-departmental system, which used formerly to be left out of the reckoning. At Nagpur it has for some time been the custom to buy from a contractor in the bazar and make payments according to the price current, but Dr. Brake proposes in future to obtain his supplies daily or weekly from the market, and hopes that a saving will thus result, as sales are frequently made at rates much cheaper than those given in the price currents. Clothing. 27. Clothing charges have decreased considierably, the relative cost at the two asylums in 1877 and 1878 being6 inter-departmentally for nawar and tât supplied to the School of Industry, and Rs. 30-11-10 realised in cash by the sale of vegetables in the station. This latter amount is exclusive of the value of vegetables supplied to the inmates of the asylum, which is estimated at Rs. 258 according to bazar rates, and which is shown in column 5 of the Statement. This amount has also been brought into account in Statement IX, thus rectifying the error animadverted on in paragraph 5 of the review for 1877. 34. The reports of the Superintendents, together with the returns, are sub- mitted in accordance with previous custom. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, J. L. LOCH, Offg. Inspetctor General of Prisons, C. P. 30 5 79 4 C 52 262

REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES, FOR THE YEAR 1879. NAGPUR : PRINTED AT THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE PRESS. 1880.
No. 2092/101 FROM A. H. L. FRASER, ESQUIRE, ASSISTANT SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. To THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OF PRISONS, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 7th June 1880. SIR, I am directed to acknowledge your letter No. 2161, dated 22nd ultimo, reporting on the working of the Nagpur and Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylums dur- ing the year 1879. 2. The following figures, extracted from Statement I, show at a glance the details of the population of these two institutions for the last two years:2 tion is situated. Dr. Rice had suggested that perhaps the proximity of the asy- lum led to patients being too readily sent to it; and the Chief Commissioner directed that the propriety of admissions should be carefully tested. Dr. Rice now reports that "all cases from the Jubbulpore district are sent to him in the first " instance, which so far guards against unnecessary admissions." The figures given in Statement III. now show that the Jubbulpore and Nagpur districts supply respectively only two-fifths and about one-fourth of the admissions to their asylums for 1879. 6. Statement V. shows that of the 46 persons admitted to the asylums, 39 were from 20 to 40 years of age. This appears to be the period of life at which insanity, if it occurs at all, is likely to develop itself. Dr. Rice says, " amongst pauper lunatics, such as we are now treating of, the circumstances of " life are not such as would be likely to postpone the outbreak. In the three cases " where the age was over 40, they were second and third attacks." In the Nagpur Asylum there were one case under 20, and two over 40, years of age. It is not stated whether the two last were first attacks. 7. As regards the types of insanity, there would appear to be considerable difference in the systems of classification observed. "Chronic mania" and " chronic dementia" are credited with nearly two-thirds of the cases treated. In Nagpur 59 are set down to the former, and 35 to the latter, while in Jubbul- pore the figures are 22 and 62 respectively. Similarly for " acute mania " and " acute dementia" the figures for Nagpur are 21 and 5, and those for Jubbul- pore 7 and 11. Again " idiotcy," of which no cases are recorded at Nagpur, has 39 in the Jubbulpore Asylum, while " melancholia " and " insipientia " have far more cases in the former than in the latter institution. 8. The causes of insanity have been, as usual, very difficult to ascertain. The Superintendent of the Nagpur Asylum has apparently been more success- ful than Dr. Rice, in tracing these causes. He returns only 8 out of 21 cases, and Dr. Rice 16 out of 25, as " unknown." Grief and religion are alleged as the cause of insanity in two cases at each asylum ; and all the rest of the known cases are physical. Of these ganja is credited with 7 cases at Nagpur and 5 at Jubbulpore. There is no apparent reason to doubt the accuracy of these con- clusions. 9. Dr. Rice writes very favourably of the health of the inmates of the Jubbulpore Asylum : there were only 31 admissions to hospital ( as against 88 for 1878 ) and 5 deaths during 1879. In Nagpur the admissions to hospital were 121 and the deaths 8. Last year Dr. Brake attributed the numerous admissions to hospital (128) to the unhealthiness of the year; but he describes this year as a "healthy one," and there is no explanation of the prevalence of sickness. 10. The total expenditure is shown in Statement IX. to have been Rs. 11,025 for the Nagpur Asylum, and Rs. 10,657 for that at Jubbulpore. The annual cost per head was Rs. 85-14-1 and Rs. 83-13-5, respectively. The total expenditure on both institutions has considerably decreased as compared with 1878 ; but the average cost per head is slightly higher at Jubbulpore, owing to the smaller daily average of inmates, over whom the cost was distributed. It is unnecessary to follow you through your criticisms of the financial statements ; but I am to say that the Chief Commissioner concurs with you in regretting that the clothing for the inmates of the Jubbulpore Asylum should not have been made up by themselves as usual, so as both to save expense and afford a suitable means of employment. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, A. H. L. FRASER, Asst. Secretary.
No. 2161. FROM LIEUTENANT-COLONEL J. L. LOCH, OFFICIATING INSPECTOR GENERAL OF PRISONS, Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 22nd May 1880. SIR, I have the honor to forward, in original, the reports on the working of the Nagpur and Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylums, during the year 1879, together with amalgamated Statements I. to XI., on which I have to offer the following brief remarks:2 " asylum; they were harmless, there was no prospect of improvement in their " mental condition, and their friends were able and willing to take charge of them;" under these circumstances they ought to have been entered as " not improved." Deaths. 5. In the Nagpur asylum, 7 males and one female died during 1879, whereas in 1878, though the total number was the same, the pro- portion of males to females was exactly the reverse. The daily average sick increased from 5.19 to 5.42. In the Jubbulpore asylum, there have been 4 less deaths, 5* against 9 ; and * 3 males. 2 females. the daily average sick decreased from 4.6 to 3.44. Remaining. 6. The number of inmates at close of 1879 in the two asylums was:3 and theft. He was found to be insane while in jail, and transferred to the asylum under Section 31 of Act V. of 1871. Of the two men reported to have absconded only one is traceable in column 7 (c) of Statement I. Deaths. 10. Of the two men who died in the Nagpur asylum, one named Paikya, "described as old and weak on his admission in March " 1871, was alway voracious, eating earth, charcoal and all kinds of rubbish." He died from general debility after an attack of fever. The other man named Dewaji, "not very healthy on admission in May 1873, was frequently in hospital, and died from softening of the brain and infiltration from a diseased petrous bone and abscess of the internal ear." One criminal lunatic is reported to have died in the Jubbulpore asylum, but no particulars of his case have been given. Remaining. 11. The number remaining at close of the year was: 4 now treating of, the circumstances of life are not such as would be likely to post- pone the out-break." Statement VI.5 and in the Jubbulpore hospital only 5 patients died, 1 from epilepsy and 4 from dysentery. At close of the year there remained in hospital only 2 patients at Nagpur, and none at Jubbulpore. Statement IX.6 Bazar and Europe medicines. 22. The charge for European medicines at Jubbulpore (Rs. 17-3-0) is the estimated cost of medicines supplied from the dispensary. At Nagpur European medicines to the value of Rs. 329 were consumed ; but the amount has been excluded from the statement under review, to avoid confusion, the same having been shown in the Deputy Account- ant General's books under the head "Hospitals and Dispensaries." The differ- ence in the expenditure is remarkable, and explanation will be called for. Statement X. STATEMENTS.

REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1880. NAGPUR: PRINTED AT THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE PRESS. 1881.
Note on the working of the Nagpur and Jub- bulpore Lunatic Asylums for the year 1880. The prescribed Statements I. 2 5. Statement VIII. shows that sickness has been less at the Nagpur asy. lum and greater at Jubbulpore, while the mortality in both has been higher than in the previous year. The prevailing diseases were ague and dysentery. 6. Statements IX., X. and XI. show receipts and expenditure, and are generally satisfactory. A general fall in the price of food-grains has caused a diminished expenditure under diet, and careful management has been exercised to keep all charges as low as possible. Statement XI. shows that the Nagpur asylum has been more successfully managed than that of Jubbulpore. This is because a farm is attached to the for- mer, where food-grains and cotton are grown, whereas at Jubbulpore there is only a small plot under garden cultivation in which vegetables are grown. To raise his income, and, at the same time, reduce present expenditure, the Superintendent of the Jubbulpore asylum proposes to introduce oil pressing on a scale sufficient to meet the small demands of the institution. This industry may be introduced, but the Superintendent should be careful not to exact too severe task work. (By order) LINDSAY NEILL, Offg. Secretary. The 9th May 1881.
Annual Report on the Lunatic Asylum, Nagpur, for the year 1880. I have the honor to forward my report on the working of the Nag- pur Government Lunatic Asylum during the year 1880. 2. Statement I. gives the number of admissions, discharges and deaths during the year, as well as the corresponding figures for the preceding ten years for comparison. There were in the asylum at the commencement of 1880 ninety-three males and twenty-nine females or a total of 122. At the close of the year there remained 86 males and 27 females, total 113 ; showing a decrease of 7 males and 2 females, and a general total less than in any year since 1874. At no time was there any overcrowding, the highest numbers present on any night being 95 males and 29 females or 24 and 7 respectively less than the calculated capacities of the male and female wards. 3. The admissions appear as 13 males and 6 females, total 19, but in fact only 11 new males were admitted, making the total 17, as two men were dis- charged and re-admitted during the year. One Khushal, a criminal lunatic, dis- charged on July 10th as " cured and capable of making his defence " was received back on December 1st, having been tried for the murder of his child and acquitted on the ground of insanity at the time of committing the offence. The other, by name Bhawindas, a faqir, was admitted suffering from acute mania following ganja smoking, got well when deprived of the drug, and was discharged on October 2nd, to be brought back, however, on October 4th, having become quite outrageous on again coming under the influence of ganja. A woman, Thulsi by name, who has been more than once in the asylum, and last discharged on May 3rd 1878, was readmitted as a criminal lunatic. She is a kleptomaniac, pilfering grain or small articles whenever she has an opportunity. On being sent in prison for a petty theft she became quite unmanageable, and since her last admission to the asylum on June 25th has been very troublesome, urgent to be sent back to prison or discharged, declining to do work of any kind, frequently crying and sometimes so persistent in refusing food, as to necessitate the use of the stomach tube or enema apparatus for the introduction of the nourishment absolutely required to sustain life. 4. The discharges during the year have been 19, viz. 14 males and 5 females; of these 8 males and 5 females were released " cured " and 5 males improved and made over to the charge of friends. One male, a criminal was, transferred to Nagpur Central Jail, and another criminal discharged as cured was received back as noted in paragraph 3. The deaths were 9, viz. 6 males and 3 females. 5. Of the non-criminals admitted, one was a cultivator from Bhandara, suffering from acute mania, said to follow an attack of fever. The man no doubt had suffered from inflammation of the brain and its membranes, got quite well un- der treatment and was discharged " cured." The second was a dismissed purvey or received from Nagpur, suffering from acute mania, the result of immoderate spirit drinking. He was made over to his friends on their giving security for his proper protection and care. The third was a potter received from Wardha, concerning whom no informa- tion could be obtained. The fourth, a sepoy, brought from an out-station, probably suffering from the result of inflammation of the brain or its membranes. The fifth, a cultivator, who has suffered from epilepsy since his childhood. The sixth, a Mahommedan female, from Nagpur, suffering from puerperal melancholia, cured. The seventh, a Madras Mahommedan, from Nagpur, an incorrigible drunk- ard and ganja smoker, sent to the asylum by his friends who pay for his main- tenance. The eighth, a beggar from Bassim in the Berars, found wandering in the Nagpur district, suffering from chronic dementia, attributed to ganja smoking. The ninth, a wandering Byraghi, wandering in Nagpur, quite maniacal from ganja smoking, admitted twice. The tenth, a Kunbi from Wardha, suffering from acute mania, following desertion by her husband.
2 The eleventh, a Native Christian female, from Nagpur, who has been suffer- ing for four years from mania, following a confinement, and as at last become unmanageable at home. The twelvth, the widow of a weaver received from Chanda, suffering from melancholia, but without sufficient history for me to form an opinion as to the cause of her insanity. The thirteenth, an idiot girl, sent from Chanda, without any history. The fourteenth, a cultivator from Nagpur, suffering from dementia with a family history of insanity, two uncles and others of his relations having been of unsound mind. The fifteenth, an idiot man, sent from Bhandara, without name or any his- tory whatever. Numbers 13 and 15 were only admitted in December, and I have applied for more information about them. 6. Statement 2 3 Five males and 1 female were admitted suffering from acute mania. Two females from chronic mania extending over 4 years or more. One male and 2 females suffered from melancholia, the first apparently from brooding over his confinement in jail, and one of the females was attacked after child-bearing. The case of acute dementia is that of a man with strong hereditary predis- position suddenly becoming incoherent and unable to control his thoughts. Of those chronically demented one comes without history, and another is an epilep- tic with softening of the brain, and the third is hopelessly insane from excesses and ganja smoking. The idiots are a man and a girl picked up by the police in out-districts and sent in for treatment. They probably have been encouraged to wander from their homes on account of the cost and trouble to their relations, at present unknown ; but I have requested the district officers to have the wanderings of the man and girl traced back, in order that their friends may be found, for beyond some improve- ment in their habits little can be hoped for from treatment in the asylum. The man returned as "not insane" is the criminal Khushal recovered so as to be able to stand his trial, at which he was acquitted on the ground of insanity. 11. Statement 7.4 Moonia, a female in the asylum 8 years, wasted away from cancerous disease of the uterus. A melanotic tumour found at the upper and posterior part of that organ. Rambhut, admitted in 1874, died from pulmonary consumption, the right lung full of cavities. Membranes of the brain thickened with old deposits of lymph. Seeta, a female, admitted in 1877, died from extensive valvular disease of the heart with dropsical and plueritic effusions. Bones of the skull thickened. Dura mater thick and adherent, old deposits of lymph over the convolutions of the brain, which was smaller and softer than natural. Kunkuram, died from general tuberculous, both lungs full of tubercles, which were also found studded over the peritoneum, and within the liver and other organs. This man persistently refused medicine and food which had to be given in the form of enema. 14. Besides treating those in hospital, for what may be considered as acci- dental or' uncurrent diseases, efforts were invariably made to cure or improve the condition of those amongst the insane who offered any hope. The violence of maniacs was restrained by cold douches and full doses of Hydrate of Chloral. One epileptic was cured by a long course of Bromide of Potassium, and the condi- tion of other epileptics improved by the employment of the same drug. No res- traint has been allowed beyond shutting up in a separate but open ward or cell for short periods individuals temporarily excited. The exception being in the case of the criminal Mahso after his last escape, who was hand-cuffed every night for security until removed to the Central Jail, but this cannot be considered as any portion of the treatment of insanes, as this man is not insane. One of the commonest symptoms noticed in new comers is filthiness in habits, and this is one of the first corrected, and the instances are rare where, except in the case of incurable idiots, it has not been more or less completely overcome after a time. All who will work have some simple employment found for them, from pulling up weeds and carrying water, to spinning and weaving cloth for the inmates; none are forced to work; but the industrious are rewarded by a little extra tobacco or a handful of parched rice, whilst the lazy may have a few grains of their tobacco kept back. After working hours, the men are allowed to sing, dance and play simple native instruments, provided they do not become too noisy. With few exceptions the inmates are happy and contented, three only being always clamor- ous for release. 15. Statements 9, 10 and 11, referring to finance, will, I believe, be con- sidered favorable. There has been an increase of Rs. 108 under the head of Establishment, explained by the employment of a 1st class Hospital Assistant at Rs. 75 a month since April 3rd in the place of a 2nd class Hospital Assistant at Rs. 55, as Deputy Superintendent, but there was no extra allowance for dearness of provisions as in 1879, and the services of a barber and of a dhobee have been dispensed with during the whole year. As the average number of inmates has diminished during the year, but not sufficiently so to admit of reduction of estab- lishment, the cost for each must of necessity be higher, and the excess charge under this head is Rs. 3-8-0 for each. 16. The average cost of diet has been less by Rs. 10-14-6 grain being much cheaper. The purchasing of grain &c., in the open bazar has been continued, and certainly he supply has been better, and there has been a saving of Rs. 476, calculated upon the monthly rates furnished by the Deputy Commissioner. Rs. 283-12-9 is the value of food received from the asylum, farm and garden. The cotton clothing was entirely supplied from lunatic labor, from the sow- ing of the seed, to the making up into garments, and was valued at Rs. 97-2-9. Blankets and tat bedding were obtained from the Central Jail at an interdepart- mental expenditure of Rs. 292-8-0, the cost for the year being on an average Rs. 3-1-11 per head. The wear and tear in the asylum is always great, but the cost for the current year will be much less than in 1880. The cost of European medicines was Rs. 67-12-3, giving an average of 9 annas 4 pies.
5 17. Under the head of Contingencies are included road expenses to released patients, stationery, petty repairs and miscellaneous charges (including dishes, plates, &c.,) amounting in all to about Rs. 85, but besides these are the garden and farm charges, feeding of cows and bullocks, purchase and repair of tools of industry, &c, amounting to Rs. 488 covered nearly twice over by the profits. Very little was done to the buildings by the Public Works Department beyond repairing broken roofs and turning tiles, but the interior of the wards was white-washed from time to time by the lunatics themselves, at a cost of Rs. 28-12-0. Rs. 252-14-1 were received from military and private patients for mainte- nance, and the amount deposited in the Treasury. More money has to be real- ized for the months of November and December. Rs. 337-7-2 were realized in cash from sales of produce and from lunatic labor. This sum has also been deposited. The profits will be seen from Statement 11, the gross amount Rs. 1,185-11-10 including the value of crops standing on December 31st 1879. 18. The average number of persons employed is put down at 93.95, but this number only indicates those not absolutely idle. The work obtained from the majority is almost nominal. Only one sweeper is entertained, but all the menial work, as cooking, cleaning, washing, water carrying, is performed by the lunatics, some of whom can do little more than sweep a yard or carry a gurrah of water. Still my principle is to keep every one employed in some way, from picking up weeds to weaving cloth. 19. The crops collected at the end of the year have been calculated at a low estimate to be worth Rs. 195-14-6, and the value of bullocks, cows and calves has been included under the heading of " Plant and Machinery." Some of the young bullocks now training for the yoke will probably be sold during the cur- rent year. Additions have been made to the stock of tools and machinery, and one of the new keepers entertained is a carpenter able to do rough farm work. 20. On April 3rd Second Class Hospital Abdul Majid Khan was trans- ferred at his own request to the dispensary at Kawardha in the Zamindari of that name. He was a well-behaved, steady and intelligent subordinate, and had become well used to his work. His successor, First Class Hospital Assistant Appudassen, was quite new to the duties and inclined to trust too much to those under him. He is a respectable, well behaved man, and will, I hope, become an efficient Deputy Superintendent. He was not well assisted by the Clerk and Compounder whom he found attached to the asylum, and this young man was removed. The youth now serving appears willing, but has only been a few weeks in the office. 21. The asylum has been visited by the Chief Commissioner and by the Deputy Surgeon General, as well as monthly by the Committee of Visitors. The reports have always been favorable. JOHN BRAKE, Nagpur. Civil Surgeon, Supt., Nagpur Lunatic Asylum. The 24th January 1881.
6 Annual Report on the Lunatic Asylum, Jubbulpore, for the year 1880. Statement No. 1.7 Insane people are not likely to take care of themselves, and therefore we have no right to expect many admissions among people over 40. Statement No. 6.8 order as exercised in India would ever permit things to go so far as that. I have been told that Natives have gone mad from "grief" It is much more likely to have been the want and destitution which often are owing to the same cause as led to the grief. Statement 8.9 It costs us a rupee for every 2½ or 2¾ seers, while we can get the same article in the bazar at 4 seers per rupee. We are charged with Rs. 134 for this item during the year 1880. The Deputy Superintendent, First Class Hospital Assistant Mir Zamin Ali, continues to give me much satisfaction ; he always works hard to keep the asylum and its inmates clean, and in good order. The official visitors inspected the asylum regularly during the year and were on all occasions satisfied with the manner in which the institution was conducted. JUBBULPORE, W. R. RICE, M. D., The 22nd January 1881, Civil Surgeon.

REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES, FOR THE YEAR 1881. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] NAGPUR: PRINTED AT THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE PRESS. 1882.
No 1728/98 FROM C. W. IMRIE, ESQUIRE, C. S., OFFG. ASST. SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. To THE DEPUTY SURGEON GENERAL, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 18th May 1882. SIR, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of the Annual Reports and Statements of the Nagpur and Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylums for the year 1881, which have this year been forwarded through your office, and reviewed by your predecessor, under instructions from the Government of India. Statement I. 2. When the year opened there were 113 patients at Nagpur and 125 at Jubbulpore, and when it closed there were 110 and 124 respectively. The daily average strength was almost the same for each Asylum as in 1880. In 1881 there were 14 patients admit- ted and 12 discharged at Nagpur, while at Jubbulpore the numbers were 28 and 21 respectively. Of the admissions, 5 at Nagpur and 7 at Jubbulpore were of criminal lunatics. The percentage of cures was slightly higher than that of deaths, but where the population is so small, the ailments in most cases probably aggravated by brain disease, and this disease often brought on, as Doctor Rice remarks, by previous destitution, the percentages referred to cannot be expected to be normal. Statement II. 3. The number of criminal lunatics was the same at the end as at the beginning of the year, but the daily average was some- what higher at Nagpur and lower at Jubbulpore than in 1880. The Superintendent at Jubbulpore quotes an opinion of the Commis- sioner's, that lunatics confined on the commission of petty offences should after a time corresponding to the average sentence awarded to sane offenders in like cases be transferred to the non-criminal list. On this subject it would seem unnecessary to lay down any rules, as the present table serves its purpose in showing the numbers of inmates received under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, and an alteration in the table would not, the Chief Commis- sioner presumes, mean an alteration in the treatment of patients. He under- stands that they are practically dealt with somewhat differently from those who have committed grave crimes and are still held dangerous. Statement VI. 4. Statement VI. is an interesting one, and the returns would be more valuable if the two Superintendents were in more agree- ment as to the classification of types of insanity. As in previous years patients afflicted with mania preponderate at Nagpur, and those afflicted with dementia and idiocy at Jubbulpore. The entries under acute and chronic mania are 54 per cent of the total at Nagpur and 24 per cent at Jub- bulpore : those under acute and chronic dementia and idiocy are 25 per cent at Nagpur and 61 at Jubbulpore. From the reports of this and previous years, the Chief Commissioner would conclude that Dr. Brake draws the line as to maniacal excitement lower down than Doctor Rice, while Doctor Rice finds mania to degenerate to chronic dementia and often end in " acquired idiocy," and alters his classification accordingly. It may perhaps be possible for you, now that the reports are submitted through your office, to afford information which will
2 enable the Chief Commissioner to have a fairly accurate comparative view of the operations of the two Asylums. The results of these operations are noticed briefly by Dr. Hutchinson in paragraph 8 of his Review; and the subject is one of considerable professional interest. Both this subject and the causes of insanity might with advantage be treated more systematically in review- ing the reports of the two Superintendents. They are matters which can be best treated from a professional point of view. 5. The patients at the Nagpur Asylum have advantages as to occupation which are not possessed by those at Jubbulpore. They are mostly employed in agriculture, and are stated in the report to have grown a cotton crop and to have performed every operation from sowing the seed to making garments for them- selves of the cotton produced. Financially the results appear to have been excellent. At Jubbulpore the patients were employed chiefly in weaving and indoor work, where unskilled labour is of little use and charges for raw material are high. The same profits are thus not to be expected at Jubbulpore as at Nagpur, but relatively speaking the financial results at both Asylums are encouraging. Work was profitable, food was cheaper, there were more receipts from " paying patients," and there seems to have been more economy in manage- ment. 6. The cost of establishment is higher at Nagpur than at Jubbulpore. This was remarked on last year by the Government of India, but the rea- sons have been fully given in the Nagpur report. The proposal made by Dr. Hutchinson to have a Darogha at each Asylum in addition to the Hospital Assistant does not at once commend itself to the Chief Commissioner, as the duties do not appear to be too heavy for one man : but on this point he would be glad to have the opinion of the Superintendents. 7. In conclusion I am to ask you to convey the Chief Commissioner's thanks to Drs. Brake and Rice for their interesting reports. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, C. W. IMRIE, Offg. Asst. Secretary.
No. 1118/C.C. FROM J. A. C. HUTCHINSON, ESQUIRE, M. D., DEPUTY SURGEON GENERAL, Central Provinces. To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 23rd February 1882. SIR, I have the honor to forward the Annual Reports and Statements of the Lunatic Asylums at Nagpur and Jubbulpore. 2. It is satisfactory to find that with the steady growth in the population of these Provinces, there is not a corresponding increase in cases of insanity. 3. The proportion of insanes to the general population, especially if deduc- tion be made of the disease occurring in foreigners, is small. 4. The admissions into Nagpur Asylum amounted to 14, and into Jubbulpore 28; the average admissions for the 10 previous years in the former asylum being 29.4, and in the latter 40.1. The admissions were classified at Nagpur under the following types of insanity: 2 And again :3 The Superintendent remarks thus on the climate :4 In Jubbulpore it is Superintendent, Deputy Superintendent, writer, war- ders, matrons, malee and sweepers. The cost is Rs. 400. But the increased cost at Nagpur is sufficiently explained by the Superintendent in his report. 16. Both Deputy Superintendents had to be removed in the course of the year for untrustworthiness. In my opinion, too much responsibility is placed on one individual, and that it would be better for the working of the asylums were there a divided charge. The Hospital Assistant, with a special allowance, would be confined to the medical and sanitary arrangements of the asylum ; and inspection of the diets and the charge of the manufactory, providing of funds, &c., should be placed in the hands of a Darogah. This system would entail greater expense, but I am confident it would lead to beneficial results. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, J. A. C. HUTCHINSON, Deputy Surgeon General, Central Provinces.
No. 749/G. FROM BRIGADE SURGEON J. BRAKE, SUPDT. GOVT. LUNATIC ASYLUM, NAGPUR, Central Provinces. To THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OF PRISONS, THROUGH THE DEPUTY SURGEON GENERAL, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 31st January 1882. SIR, I have the honor to forward the prescribed Statistical Statements for the year 1881, with such remarks as I think desirable to explain clearly the working of the Nagpur Lunatic Asylum during that year ending December 31st. 2. Statement I. gives the number of admissions, discharges and deaths, as well as the corresponding figures for the 10 preceding years, but for the past year the re-admissions have been taken into account in calculating the percent- ages, as requested by the Secretary to the Government of India. There were in the asylum at the commencement of 18812 The third, a beggar and ganja smoker, was caught attempting to set fire to a house, giving as his only reason that "the weather was cold and he wanted to keep himself warm." He is quiet, but filthy in his habits and addicted to self-abuse, not likely to get well. He came from Baroda and has no friends. The fourth, a Saees, native of Bolundshar, but in service at Nagpur, was admitted on May 12th, having attempted suicide by throwing himself down a well. He afterwards whilst under observation in the asylum attempted to strangle himself with his waist string ; this was tied tightly round his neck and artfully concealed by his dhotee, carefully wound round the upper part of his body and head. The man suffers from melancholia with delusions, following desertion by his wife. The fifth, a trooper of 2nd Madras Cavalry, received on June 10th, suffer- ing from acute mania,3 The fifth is a young man of good education and respectably connected. He was received on 1st September as unable to make his defence to a charge of personating a Nawab, seeking interviews with officials under his assumed charac- ter and forging the signatures of European officers in the station. He has hallu- cinations and is incoherent at times, occasionally becoming excited and angry. His eccentricity was first noticed after his recovery from an attack of fever fol- lowing the death of his mother, for whose loss he grieved very much. 6. The man readmitted from Chanda, Umroo by name, was received back on October 15th, having been improperly released from custody by a Native Magis- trate in March 1871. In the years 1865 and 1866 he was known to be insane and dangerous, assaulting people without cause, and on one occasion he dragged his own mother by one leg through his village to a certain temple. He was then said to have lucid intervals of 5 or 6 months' duration. In October 1866 without provocation he murdered the Malguzar of his village, wounded the Malguzar's wife, and then killed a Gosain boy aged 16, whom he met on the road after wounding the others. He was detained at Chanda till March 1867, when he was sent to the Nag- pur Asylum, where he was received on March 10th. He was then violent and incoherent, but on December 12th 1867 is reported to have become quiet after an attack of fever. From that date there is no record of his having been otherwise than quiet and rational. On more than one occasion he was brought by the Superintendent before the official visitors of the Asylum as capable of making his defence, and on February 2nd 1870 was pronounced by the visitors " apparently sane," but considering the very serious nature of his offence the visitors thought it desirable to detain him some time longer, the Commissioner noting that "he might perhaps be discharged six months later." He was not discharged from the asylum how- ever till 10th March 1871, when he was sent back to Chanda, as a prisoner capable of making his defence. By the Magistrate at Chanda he was acquitted on the ground of insanity, but instead of being sent back to the asylum to be detained under the orders of the Local Government, he appears to have been released from custody altogether. In 1880 the man was again insane and treated at Chanda, after a time being discharged as cured. In June 1881 he murdered the Patel of Boregaon, son of the Malguzar whom he killed in 1866. For this murder he is now in the asylum as an insane unable to make his defence. He was received on October 15th, and since then has threatened to kill two of the Asylum subordinates. He confesses to having murdered three persons already, and will not be satisfied till he has killed two others of his first victim's family. No cause was assigned for his madness when first admitted in 1867, and after so many years it is impossible for me to express an opinion. The cause therefore is again reported as " unknown." 7. Of the 12 discharged 7 were "cured" of their insanity, 3 were made over to their friends " improved" and two "not improved." Of the 7 cured 5 were criminals, and 2 of these released by order of the Chief Commissioner and made over to their friends, who are answerable for their future good beha- viour. The first had been in the asylum since April 1877, having murdered his wife during a fit of mania following a debauch in which, according to the man's own statement, he had drunk 30 rupees worth of toddy in a month. He was in indifferent health when he was received and lately has exhibited marked signs of phthisis pulmonalis. On finding himself seriously ill he refused food and medicine, expressing a wish to die rather than remain in the asylum without hope of release.
4 The second was a man who while suffering from melancholia set fire to his own house, for which he was tried and acquitted on the ground of insanity. He was reported to have been well two months before he was admitted into the asylum on 5th April, and up to the time of his release on 16th August had shown no sign since coming under my observation. 8. Three criminals were discharged from the asylum as cured and capable of making their defence, and were sent back to their several districts for trial. The first, was a man received from Chanda in May 1877, accused of murder- ing his wife. The second, a woman admitted in January from Bhandara, accused of infanticide. And the third, a man received from Raipur in April, not insane. 9. Of the non-criminals discharged cured one was a constable from Wardha who had become maniacal from ganja smoking ; the other a Railway laborer from Bhandara, who had probably suffered from fever, affecting the brain. 10. Of those discharged " improved" one was a Native Christian woman in a state of melancholy following puerperal mania, who was made over to the care of a married daughter in fair circumstances. The second was the son of respectable parents in Nagpur with his intellect weakened by habitual ganja smoking, made over to the care of his father. The third a wandering religious mendicant, made over to the care of his wife. 11. Of those discharged " not improved " one was a woman received in an advanced stage of consumption, made over to her husband ; and the second an epileptic imbecile, made over to his friends, who are well able to keep him, as not a fit person to be retained as a pauper in the asylum. 12. Statement III. gives the religion and sex of those admitted as well as the districts from which they were received. Of the male non-criminals 4 are natives of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh (a constable, laborer, saees and chaprassi), one is a beggar from Baroda, one a beggar from Berar, and one a trooper from Bellary in Madras. As usual the Hindus greatly out-number the Muhammadans,5 Cases of acute mania are, according to my experience, the most common, arising, as they so often do, from ganja smoking, sudden excitement and special disease affecting the brain; they are also the most amenable to treatment. All acute cases are actively treated, One chronic case got well after a severe attack of intermittent fever, treated successfully with small doses of arsenic. Other cases are improving, and the use of Bromide of Potassium in large and repeated doses is found very efficacious in some forms of epilepsy. Of the two idiots alluded to in paragraph 10 of my last year's report as recently received without history, and concerning whom I addressed the District Officers, I am sorry to say I have learnt nothing satisfactory. 15. In Statement VII. there is a large number remaining over from preceding years, the causes of whose insanity are recorded as " unknown;" and the one man an old patient readmitted this year is so entered as the particulars of old patients now available are too meagre for me to form a reliable judgment. Even now the histories received with new cases from out-stations are often most unsatisfactory, and it is difficult and often impossible for me at Nagpur to obtain information which might be readily obtained on the spot whence the people are sent. With all one's care very positive information is not always available, but I believe the causes now assigned to be very fairly accurate. The Madras Sowar I believe to have had sunstroke followed by inflammatory thickening of the mem- branes of the brain. I have treated him in that belief and he is very much better. The three cases entered under " grief" are6 One of the males, Punchum, was a criminal, who committed suicide by throw- ing himself down a well. A warder in whose charge the man had been placed was tried for culpable negligence and punished by imprisonment. A second, Pyku, died from old age and debility. He was 70 years old, when received on December 13th 1871, had been in the asylum over 9 years, and must therefore have been close upon 80 years of age at the time of his death. On post mortem examination some serous effusion was found in the sub- arachnoid space. especially at the base of the brain. The dura mater was thick- ened, the arachnoid opaque and pia mater congested. The brain itself small, shrunken and indurated, its substance peculiarly hard and broken with some difficulty. The heart was fatty with mitral valves impaired by atheromatous deposit. Large intestine from hepatic flexure downwards, gangrenous, other portions of intestines congested and inflamed but without ulceration. A third, Syennah, had been in the asylum since its opening, having been received from Nagpur jail in July 1864. He was then described as " thin and slender, subject to hæmorrhage;" for years he had been feeble and emaciated notwithstanding a voracious appetite. He died from phthisis on November 2nd. On examination it was found that the bones of the head were unusually thick and dense ; the brain small, pale and an7 18. No alterations have been made in the general management, except the important one of change in the Deputy Superintendent. Hospital Assistant Appudassen was found untrustworthy and removed, and the former Deputy Superintendent, Abdul Majid Khan, re-appointed. The diet, employment, and amusements are the same as before and are shortly indicated in paragraph 14 of last year's report. 19. Statements IX., X., and XI. relating to Finance, will, I hope, be considered favourable. Nos. IX. and XI. have been altered this year, so that comparison with former returns is not so readily made. From Statement IX. it will be seen that the receipts in 1881 were Rs. 8,832-4-7 as compared with Rs. 10,241-2-4 in 1880, and that the expenditure, excluding the charges of the Public Works and Printing departments, was Rs. 9,515-10-2 against Rs. 10,241-2-4. The amount actually received from the Treasury, omitting fractions, was Rs. 8,034 as compared with Rs. 8,952 in 1880; the amount received from paying patients Rs. 396 instead of Rs. 253, but the value credited to the Manufactory was Rs. 402 instead of Rs. 694. 20. On the expenditure side the Establishment cost Rs. 5,207 instead of Rs. 5,467, and the diet purchased in the market Rs. 2,483 against Rs. 3,236. I have had a calculation made month by month of the price of grain, &c., according to nerik and the actual price paid for the Asylum in the open market, and find that the saving to Government by the latter method was Rs. 216. Nothing was paid in cash for clothing, and only Rs. 145 charged inter- departmentally against Rs. 340 in 1880, when blankets had to be obtained from the Central Jail. The clothing supplied during the year under review was obtained entirely from the Asylum. The cotton seeds were sown on Asylum grounds, the crop tended and gathered, ginned, spun, woven and made up into garments by the lunatics themselves, the services of a carder only having been employed from the outside population. Under the head of "Contingencies proper," in the Treasury account I have included Miscellaneous charges for baskets, pots, kerosine oil, the cost of country stationery, official postage and garden and farm contingencies, as cost of mote, of seeds for sowing, oil-cake for bullocks, &c., as well as Rs. 29-12-0, the travelling expenses of the Deputy Superintendent from Kawardha. Under the head of "Contingencies of manufactures" are included the cost of raw material and the occasional charge for carding cotton. Repairs and main- tenance include the repair and purchase of furniture, the cost of a new weighing machine, Rs. 84, the purchase and repair of tools and machinery, petty repairs and construction executed by inmates, lime for whitewashing and road expenses for discharged patients. In the Manufactory account are included grain, vegetables, milk, &c., sup- plied from the farm, valued at nerik rates Rs. 669, clothing valued at Rs. 1-45. The Contingencies proper include food for cattle, supplied from the farm, as karbi, kooltai, cotton and other seeds, ropes for cattle, wood for well, &c. The charges on account of work done by the Public Works Department and the cost of printed forms are those given by the Executive Engineer and the Superintendent of the Government Press, respectively. 21. Statement X. gives the Establishment and its cost in detail. It will be seen that a sweeper is not now entertained under that denomination, though one is sanctioned. One of the keepers superintends the conservancy arrange- ments, and it would be as correct to return 1 sweeper and 8 keepers as 9 keepers and no sweeper. In the former case the ratio of male keepers to males would be 1 to 11.
8 In the review by the Government of India of last year's report the propor- tion of keepers to patients is unfavorably compared with that obtaining at the Jubbulpore Asylum, but the conditions of the two Asylums have not I think been sufficiently taken into consideration. At Jubbulpore the employment of lunatics is essentially intra-mural, the garden is small, close to the Asylum buildings, easily guarded, and indeed has within it the Deputy Superintendent's house. The Asylum itself is entirely closed in by walls and high palisades, being in fact the old Thuggee jail con- verted to its present purpose, but still secure against escapes. At Nagpur, on the contrary, the employment is almost exclusively extra- mural, the patients for the most part are employed in farm labor in widely extended fields quite unenclosed, there are two large gardens, both more than a quarter of a mile distant from the nearest buildings. The female quarters and surround- ing ground are only shut off from a frequented road and from the rest of the Asylum premises and grounds by a hedge, difficult to keep in order, from the nature of the soil, and requiring the presence of a keeper to guard the entrance during the day time. The barracks and working shed are straggling detached Military buildings converted into an Asylum, but unenclosed, there being only one walled enclosure, used in the day time for dangerous, troublesome and filthy inmates. The work of the present staff of keepers is so heavy, the facilities for the escape of the lunatics being so great, that there is much difficulty in retaining the services of good and trustworthy guards. I have done what 1 could to dimi- nish the cost by dispensing with the services of special dhobi, barber and sweeper, and on a former occasion when in charge of the Asylum reduced the duffadar to the rank of warder for failure in duty, intending to do away with the higher rank, but the man was reinstated after I had given up my temporary charge. I cannot recommend any further reduction in the number of the establishment. 22. Statement XI. shows the profits on account of manufacture and farm produce. Rs. 402 is the value of work done and paid for in cash, and for goods sold, including a pair of young oxen reared on the farm, and for which Rs. 100 was received. Rs. 1,010 is the value of food and clothing supplied, and Rs. 40 the estimated value at nerik rate of cotton recently collected and in store on December 31st. The value of plant and machinery in store is higher than in 1880, owing to the purchase of a weighing machine. and the increased value of young oxen, which are still priced below their market value. The net profit is put down at Rs. 941-8-11, but the Public Works charges for the whole Asylum, viz. Rs. 141-15-3, are debited to Manufactures for the first time, otherwise the profits would have appeared as Rs. 1,083. 23. On March 7th 1881 Hospital Assistant Abdul Majid Khan, now pro- moted to the 1st grade, and formerly Deputy Superintendent of the Asylum, was reappointed on return from the Kawardha State dispensary. Since his return the immediate superintendence has been much more trustworthy and com- plete than it was under the Hospital Assistant appointed on 3rd April 1880. There have been many changes amongst the subordinates, but I have a fairly good staff at present. The Asylum has been inspected by the Chief Commissioner, by the Judicial Commissioner, the Deputy Surgeon General, and periodically by Official visitors. The reports have been invariably favourable. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your very obedient Servant, JOHN BRAKE, Brigade Surgeon.
Annual Report of the Lunatic Asylum, Jubbulpore, for the year 1881. Statement 1.10 One (male) died suddenly in an epileptic fit ; he used to get two or three daily towards the end ; the day he died I was absent from the station visiting branch dispensaries. A post mortem examination was made by Hospital Assistant Koonji Bahary Lal, but nothing worthy of note was recorded as the result. The case of continued fever occurred early in the year ; it was of the type approaching typhus in its character as described in my Sanitary Report. Of the total 9, seven died during the last three months of the year. Six of them were always weak and sickly, and appeared to have grown worse during the severe and continuous cold of November and December. Statement II. deals with the "Criminal Lunatics." Up to 1878 these increased steadily. During the past three years the average number has decreased, but the total population was higher in 18S1 than in any preceding year, Mr. Venning, the Commissioner, is about to propose that those who have been confined for any time on account of petty offences, such as mischief, theft, &c., should be transferred to the non-criminal list ; even if they had been found guilty, they would not be imprisoned for terms any thing like the length of time they have been in the asylum. 26 males 19/females 7 remained from the previous year ; 7 males 6/female 1 were admit- ted during the year; 1 was readmitted, he is a man named Chunder Sha, accused of killing his own child. On the 1st July he was declared capable of making his defence and transferred to Hoshangabad for trial : he was acquitted, but ordered by the Chief Commissioner to be detained in the asylum and reported upon periodically. Although apparently quite sane now, experience has proved that men of his stamp cannot be trusted : it would be dangerous to society to allow them to be at large, while residence in a special institution of this kind affords them the best chance of keeping well. This man is allowed as much liberty within the asylum premises as is safe: he works cheerfully and well at making newar, and appears quite contented with his lot. One of our best weavers is a Mussulman who killed his mother; he also had been a long time in the asylum, but is subject to exacerbations of insanity every two or three months ; he grows moody, morose, apt to become quarrelsome and disputatious: but a little gentle management and a few doses of sedatives soon bring him round. In the intervals he is treated as one quite sane, and allowed to do pretty much what he likes, always of course under careful watch. For the last ten years he has been in this state, never having gone so far as to attempt to assault any one, but if discharged he would be certain to become dangerous. Six were discharged cured and capable of making their defence : one was found not insane as already detailed, and 1 died ; 26 males 19/females 7 remained at the end of the year. Statement III. shows religion, sex and district of those admitted. No Mahomedan was admitted this year. The " other castes" include Gonds, Kols, Chamars and Mehters, i. e. lower classes of Hindus. One Christian, a female, named Mrs. Coote, was admitted from Nimar : her husband deserted her; she became melancholic, and on the birth of her child was attacked with sub-acute dementia (not puerperal mania). She is harmless and quiet: if she had any friends in good circumstances it would be best to transfer her to them : but her only relative is her mother, who, though willing enough to do so, is unable to look after her: she is, therefore, under all circumstances, a fit and proper person for detention ; lately, I keep her in one of the separate rooms of the dispensary, where she is in all respects better placed than amongst a lot of noisy demented women. Indeed it would not be safe to allow her child amongst them.
11 The numbers admitted are too few to draw any inferences as to difference in predisposition to insanity between the Aryan, Aboriginal and Mahomedan classes. As usual Jubbulpore holds the first place in the numbers admitted from each district : next comes Seoni with 6, and Hoshangabad with 4 admissions. To compare Jubbulpore with the other districts exactly, the 3 who were declared "not insane" should be deducted. Doubtless similar cases occur in other districts, and on the advice of the Medical officer are treated in the same way, but not sent to the asylum. Statement No. V. gives their occupation. Beggars, ryots and servants account for two-thirds of the whole. Beggars are exposed to much privation and lead irregular lives : but perhaps the more correct way of putting it is that they are beggars because they have a tendency to insanity in them, which unfits them for any other mode of living. Cultivators are the most numerous class in the general population, and if it were not for the simple out-of-door lives they lead would contribute considerably more to the population of the asylum. Domestic servants living chiefly in large towns lead dissolute lives in much larger proportions than do other classes ; doubtless to this may reasonably be set down the large proportion of them who become mad. Bunyas, dhobis, mochis, sweepers and stone-cutters are too few to warrant any inferences. Statement No. V. represents the ages. 21 out of the 29 were between 20 and 40 years; if one is to get insane at all, it is likely to show itself within these ages. The two under 20 years are exceptional. One was a young Policeman, a student in the Police school: he suffered from a mild form of melancholia for about a month consequent on the death of his father, but he soon recovered. The other was one Gungadhur, a lad of weak intellect from Hoshangabad, who killed his sister and her daughter in a fit of frenzy : he is a heavy, stupid, morose fellow : keeps to himself, never talking to any body, or caring to be friendly with other lunatics. Statement No. VI. deals with the types of insanity of those under treatment. " Chronic Dementia" " Chronic Mania" and "Idiotcy" are the prevailing types. In former reports I have dwelt a good deal on the classification of the different forms of insanity : so many are on the border land between one form and another that much depends on the peculiarities of the observer : these differ- ences in classification at once attract the notice of non-professional persons and are very apt to be commented on. I have attempted to show how in long standing cases lunatics who were first seized with violent mania passed from one form to another until they ended in chronic dementia or idiotcy : we have in the asylum instances of this : patients who came to us maniacal twelve or fifteen years ago are now quite half witted helpless creatures, little short of being idiots : those who survive accumulate in this form, and it is to me easily intelligible why there should be more patients under the above mentioned heads than in the others. Out of the 26 new cases who were insane 17 were found to be of those types which insanity is apt to assume in its earlier stages,12 The two cases of idiotcy made over to their friends in an improved condition were when first admitted into the asylum three or four years ago unable to arti- culate a word, or to do any thing for themselves, literally helpless in the fullest sense of the term. On discharge they could talk a little, put on their clothes and keep them on, were cleaner and more decent in their habits and able to feed themselves. I have remarked improvements of this kind in five or six cases, due no doubt to the care bestowed on them while in the asylum. There are two women who have learned to spin in addition to the above, they appeared to be hopeless imbeciles on admission. Their countenances have lost the vacant idiotic expression they then had. Statement No. VII. deals with the supposed causes of insanity. Of the 29 admitted, 4 (males) were affected in consequence of the abuse of ganja ; 1 male from alcoholism : 1 from bhang : 1 epilepsy ; and a criminal lunatic was said to have become insane after " fever." These constitute the physical causes, and I think they may reasonably be accepted as correct. When we come into the domain of " moral causes" we are at once involved in much uncertainty. I have often expressed my doubts of natives going mad from grief, anger or fear. However as these causes were assigned by the Medi- cal and District officers I have included them in this Statement. Two males and 2 females were said to have become insane from " grief": to me they looked as if destitution and want of sufficient food and clothing had more to do with " exciting" the disease. In 15 cases, of whom 5 were criminal lunatics, the District officials could not conjecture what the cause was. The information furnished with lunatics is often very scanty, of necessity. because as a rule they wander away from their homes and friends until picked up by the Police in some strange bazar or village where none could give an account of them. Statement No. VIII. deals with the bodily sickness from which they suffered. 86 males 57/females 29 were treated during the year. 40 males 29/females 11 were for ague, of whom 38 were cured and 2 remained under treatment, 1 case of continued fever, with all the symptoms of typhus well marked, proved fatal after 18 days : he was a strong fairly robust man. 6 cases of an13 During the first nine months there was no serious sickness, and only two deaths; but during the last quarter the weather was continuously cold; the weak and sickly were a good deal attacked, and 7 succumbed to bowel com- plaints, debility or pneumonia. Statement No. X. is the Establishment as it stood on the 31st December 1881. It differs from that of the preceding year in having a lower class Deputy Superin- tendent whose pay is Rs. 20 per mensem less, as he does not; understand English, a great defect which in itself deprives us of half his usefulness. There are at present no " Head Warders," one was imprisoned for criminal negligence in allowing a lunatic to escape : the other resigned his post. Two ordinary Warders are entertained in their stead for the present. I am very much inclined to think that Head Warders are expensive luxuries : they were quite as liable to commit faults and neglect their duty as the others : we get on just as well without them. The total cost of Establishment is Rs. 400 per mensem against Rs. 424 in 1880. Statement Nos. IX. and XI. deal with the Cash and Manufactory accounts. The total expenditure in the asylum amounted to Rs. 9,240-15-5, but from this has to be deducted Rs. 390-5-0 drawn for raw material, chargeable to the Manufactory department, leaving Rs. 8,850-10-5 as the actual cost of maintain- ing the asylum against Rs. 9,192-14-7 in 1880. This makes the average cost of each patient Rs. 70-3-2 against Rs. 72-5 1 for the year preceding. I now proceed to analyse this expenditure. Establishment was Rs. 4,832-2-8 against Rs. 4,982 for the year preceding, being a decrease of Rs. 149-13-4, due to the Deputy Superintendent having been under suspension for 2½ months. A lower paid subordinate succeeded him, and the two Head Warders were not replaced. Diet.14 capricious, now working with great vigour, and again throwing it up and refusing to do anything for hours or days ; we have often to change the kind of work, they are apt to grow tired of one and take readily to another by way of a change. There remained in store at the beginning of the year raw material valued at Rs. 35-14-1 and about Rs. 10 worth of old plant and machinery,15 The column " readmitted" is apt to be misleading, for example in this asylum one of the two readmitted in 1880 never actually left the premises : he was transferred from the criminal to the non-criminal list on expiry of his sentence and had to be shown in Statement I., else there would have been a discrepancy between columns 5 and 8. This of course was explained in my report which accompanied the returns. In paragraph 3 of the Government of India letter it would appear that I returned Rs. 147-2-6 as remitted to the Treasury on account of Paying Patients, whereas I showed only Rs. 119-5-9. There must have been a mistake in the printing or somehow, for in the office copy of Statement IX. I have entered Rs. 119-5-9 in both sides of the account. W. R. RICE, Superintendent.

REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1882. NAGPUR : PRINTED AT THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE PRESS. 1883.
No. 1972a./128 FROM L. K. LAURIE, ESQUIRE, C. S., OFFG. Asst. SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. To THE DEPUTY SURGEON GENERAL, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 4th May 1883. SIR, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of the annual Reports and Statements of the Nagpur and Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylums, together with your review. 2. During the year there were admitted into the Asylums 13 criminal and 28 non-criminal lunatics. The number of persons re-admitted was 5. The number of persons discharged as "cured" or " improved" was 17. There were eight deaths. Two lunatics escaped (one from each of the Asylums) and two were made over to the care of relatives under Section 10 of Act 36 of 1858. There remained, at the end of 1882, in the Nagpur Asylum 109 lunatics, and in the Jubbulpore Asylum 142. As compared with the return for 1881, these figures show a decrease of one lunatic in the Nagpur Asylum and an increase of eighteen in the Jubbulpore Asylum. This increase is due to the fact that the number of deaths in and discharges from the latter institution was much smaller than in the previous year. In other respects, the figures do not differ remark- ably from the statistics for 1881. 3. From paragraph 3 of your review and from the remarks made by Dr. Rice under the heading of Table III. and by Dr. Brake in paragraph 8 of his report, it appears that the Lunatic Asylums are from time to time utilized as places for the custody of persons who are under suspicion of lunacy and whose conduct it is considered desirable to observe. This procedure is directly contrary both to the provisions of Act 36 of 1858 and to the instructions of the Govern- ment of India contained in letter No. 179 of 25th March 1876 to the Secretary to the Government of Bengal, which was reprinted with additional directions in Chief Commissioner's Book Circular No. XXXI. of 1877. It is distinctly laid down in Clause 1 of Section 8 of the Lunatic Asylums Act that, in the mofussil, no person shall be received into a lunatic asylum except under the order of a Ma- gistrate passed under Section 4 or Section 5 of the Act, or under the order of a Civil Court: and in Circular XVIII. of 1866, the Chief Commissioner pointed out that (with exception to the power of the Local Government and of certain Military officers) a Magistrate of the first class alone could make such an order in respect to wandering or dangerous or neglected lunatics only, and a Judge of the principal Civil Court of a district alone could make such an order in respect to other classes of lunatics. Furthermore, in Circular No. 251-29 of 1865 it was directed that " supposed (non-criminal) lunatics should be taken " in the first instance to the local dispensary, where they might remain under " observation for a few days, and if then pronounced dangerous or incapable " of taking care of themselves, should, under the proper legal orders, be for- " warded to the proper asylum." As noted by you in your review, and by Dr. Rice in his report, this is the course usually followed at out-stations, with the result that some of the alleged lunatics are speedily returned to their friends. In Jubbulpore, however, the Superintendent of the Asylum reports, " when
2 " there is a reasonable presumption that a person is insane, he or she is at once " sent (here) for treatment. There happens to be a Lunatic Asylum and the " patient may as well (if not better) be treated there as in an ordinary hospital. " It is always provided," he adds, " that I see the cases first and that I have " grounds for considering the Asylum the more suitable place for them." In another passage he records : " We have striven much to keep down the Asylum " population, but find it impossible to reduce it furtherf. We are more particular " now in admitting patients : none are received who are not dangerous to them- " selves or others : or who are capable of taking care of themselves or have re "latives who can look after them or who do not afford a prospect of cure from the "special treatment to be obtained in a Lunatic Asylum." From these extracts it appears that the Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylum is treated as a branch of the general hospital into which patients suffering from alienation of mind are admit- ted at the discretion of the Superintendent ; and that even in the case of such lunatics as are referred to in Sections 4 and 5 of Act 36 of 1858, the Superin- tendent is guided by his own judgment as to sanctioning or refusing admis- sion. It seems hardly necessary to point out that this view of the uses of an Asylum established under Act 36 of 1858, is not justified by either law or rule ; and the Chief Commissioner requests that you will at once issue instructions that when persons are brought to a Civil Surgeon for treatment on account of insanity, they should be treated in the hospital, or their friends should be directed to apply to the Civil Court. He takes this opportunity of impressing on all Superintendents of Asylums, that no person can be admitted under an order recorded either by a 1st Class Magistrate or by the principal Civil Court of the district unless that order purports to be made under Act 36 of 1858 : and that they should refuse to admit persons who are forwarded for " observa- tion" or temporary custody only. Such cases as that reported in paragraph 5 of Dr. Brake's report, viz. the retention in the Asylum for 18 days of a person accused of a criminal offence who was supposed to be insane but was in reality sane, should not be allowed to recur. 4. While on the subject of the legal conditions which govern the admis- sion of persons into Lunatic Asylums, notice may be taken of a remark made by the Superintendent of the Nagpur Asylum, in paragraph 15 of his report, on the subject of recovering payment for the maintenance of a lunatic. He says that in one case " the Commissioner ruled that the Government was not justified " in compelling a father to pay for the maintenance of a son of adult age whom " the Committee of visitors refused to make over to the father's care on account " of the dangerous character of his disease." It is not stated whether the lunatic was confined under the order of a Magistrate or under the order of a Civil Court ; or under what circumstances the Commissioner made a ruling on the matter : but it may be as well to point out that Government can only be relieved of the expense of maintaining a lunatic if, in the case of the order for admission having been signed by the Civil Judge, the Judge has at the time when he signed the order made a separate order for the recovery of the lunatic's maintenance (Clause 4 of Section 8, and Section 14 of Act 36 of 1858); or if, in the case of the order of admission having been signed by a Magistrate under Section 4 or 5 of the Act, the same Magistrate has subsequently moved the Civil Court and obtained a similar order for the recovery of maintenance (Sections 14, 15 of Act 36 of 1858). The law being thus clear, it is difficult to understand how any necessity for a " ruling" could have arisen. 5 The classification of lunatics according to their religion, their occupations and their ages reveals nothing that has not before been noticed. In paragraphs 162 and 163 of the Census Report for 1881 it is noted that in this Province, as in Europe, insanity is most common between the ages of 20 and 50 : and that Hindus and aboriginals, constituting as they do the bulk of the population of this Province, furnish the largest number of lunatics, who are mostly of the lower orders. Ganja, which, as stated in paragraph 159 of the same report, is preferred as an intoxicant by the lower classes on account of its being cheaper than opium, holds, as usual, the first place among the causes of insanity. As remarked by you, it is difficult to understand the principle of classification of " causes" followed in some instances; and there is something particularly puzzling in the remark made by the Superintendent of the Jubbulpore Asylum at p. 7 of the
3 report to the effect that when a tendency to insanity exists in individuals there is little in the circumstances of the Lunatic Asylum where they are treated which is likely to postpone its manifestation ; but the subject need not be pursued further since it has little practical bearing upon the management of Asylums. The same may be said of the classification of types of insanity. For some years past there has been variation in the types enumerated by the Superintendents of the two Asylums, Dr. Rice preferring the term " acquired idiotcy" and Dr. Brake the term " insipientia;" and the former maintaining that cases of acute mania tended to pass into chronic dementia. In the report for the present year Dr. Brake has explained the reason why in this latter respect his returns have not hitherto corresponded with those furnished by Dr. Rice. It is only since December last that the former has made any alteration in the classification of old inhabitants of the Asylum, whose disease has, in the meantime, changed in many cases from the acute to the chronic form, and has even, he allows, developed into something little removed from " acquired idiotcy." 6. Of the persons discharged as " cured," one, Mt. Sahudra, referred to in paragraphs 4 and 6 of the Nagpur report, seems to have been erroneously included under this head, as she is said to have shown no signs of insanity during the six months she was in confinement in the Asylum. 7. There was a considerable amount of sickness in the Nagpur asylum, but there were only three deaths resulting from disease, and those who died were all three advanced in years. 8. The economical management of both the Asylums reflects great credit on the Superintendents. Each of them shows a calculated profit on the manu- factures of the year. Dr. Rice explains that the net profits of his manufactures are obtained by simply deducting from the amount realized by sales (a) the value of manufactured goods sold which had been made in previous years, and (b) the value of the raw material used during the year. Dr. Brake has taken great pains to purchase his supplies in the best market: and Dr. Rice was able during the year to manufacture all the clothing required for the lunatics, in addition to turning out blankets, dosutie and newar, for sale to the public. The cost of management of the Jubbulpore asylum has steadily decreased during the past three years. I am to ask you to convey the Chief Commissioner's thanks to both these officers for the zealous way in which they have discharged their duties. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, L. K. LAURIE, Offg. Asst. Secretary.
No. 2395/C.C. FROM W. WATSON, ESQUIRE, M, D., OFFG. DEPUTY SURGEON GENERAL, Central Provinces, To THE OFFG. SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces, Dated Nagpur, the 17th April 1883. SIR, I have the honor to forward the Annual Reports and Statements of the Lunatic Asylums at Nagpur and Jubbulpore. 2. During the past year, the number of lunatics at Nagpur has fallen from 110 to 109, at Jubbulpore the number of lunatics has increased from 124 to 142. The Jubbulpore Asylum is, however, not over-crowded, as it is capable of holding 161 insane persons, allowing 50 superficial feet per patient. With regard to criminal lunatics there has been an increase of 1 at Nagpur, and of 4 at Jubbulpore. 3. From Statement III. it will be noticed that, the Zilas of Nagpur and Jubbulpore in which the Asylums are situated, supply the largest number of admissions. This is especially marked at Jubbulpore; and, as the Superin- tendent states, this is only what might be expected, as, at out-stations, lunatics are generally kept for some time under observation at the Dispensary before being sent to the Asylum. Some of the lunatics recover at the Dispensary, and others are, for one reason or another, made over to their friends. From some districts there have been no admissions this year. 4. From Statement IV. it appears that, beggar lunatics predominate at Jubbulpore. Out of a total number of 31 admissions no less than 8 were beggars. There was only 1 beggar lunatic at Nagpur among the 15 admissions. At Jubbulpore there was one land owner, one Bania, and one Goldsmith, and the Superintendent is making inquiries whether these men's relatives are able to pay for their maintenance, either wholly or in part. 5. Statement V. shows the ages of the lunatics admitted into the Asylums. As might be expected, the bulk of the lunatics admitted both at Nagpur and at Jubbulpore are between 20 and 40 years of age. This is the age at which luna- tics are likely to be dangerous to their neighbours. 6. Statement VI. gives the types of insanity. There is a considerable variation in the 2 Asylums. 'The following table gives the classified list of lunatics for the 31st December 1882 :2 I think it may be assumed that different principles of classification are adopted by the two Superintendents. 7. The Statement of the alleged causes, No. VII, is one which it is almost impossible to analyse. The Superintendents have very properly accepted in all obscure cases the statements sent along with the lunatics when they were first admitted. It is, however, difficult to believe, that there were on the 31st December 1882 in the two Asylums 16 lunatics whose lunacy was caused by grief ; 2, where it was caused by anger ; and 15 where it was caused by religion. Of the 15 reli- gious lunatics 14 were males. The division in physical and moral causes appears to me to be one which it is impossible to carry out properly. I do not understand why secret vice should be entered as a physical cause, and Puerperal insanity as a moral one. The most important practical fact I can glean from Statement VII. is that of the more common poisonous drugs. Ganga is, in the Central Provinces, much more deleterious than either opium or spirits. The following are the numbers as they stood on 31st December 1882 :From Brigade Surgeon John Brake, Superintendent Government Lunatic Asylum, Nagpur, to the Inspector General of Prisons &c., through the Deputy Surgeon General, Central Provinces,2 The second, Govind æt 35, a Gond cultivator from Raipur, accused of the murder of a child, is said to have been insane for three years and kept by his relatives; no cause is assigned for the present attack, but the man himself attri- butes his condition to the wrath of his god Burha Deo for neglect of worship. The third, Ramchandra æt 36, a Hindu cooly from Nagpur, a man of weak intellect and confirmed ganja and madak smoker, accused of stealing 2 mangoes and some bamboos, was sent to the asylum as incapable of making his defence. The fourth, Sakhia æt 19, a dak runner, was received from Chanda on August 10th, in bad health, accused of the murder of an infant without any apparent reason. The murder was seemingly committed by him whilst delirious from fever. The man has gained 31½ lbs. in weight since admission to the asylum, and is quite quiet and sane, Recommendations for his release have been submitted. The fifth, Sheodyal æt 48, a Hindu Brahmin from Bilaspur, a ganja smoker, was accused of murdering a man without cause or quarrel His relatives state that he has been insane for 7 years and has been an inordinate smoker. One female, æt 20, was received from Nagpur accused of house-trespass but not insane, and discharged at the first meeting of the committee of visitors, 18 days after admission, 6. The criminal re-admitted was Birsha Gond, æt 31, from Chanda. He had murdered his wife in 1877 and been sent to the asylum as incapable of making his defence. On October 8th, 1881, he was sent back to Chanda sane, to be tried for the offence ; he was then acquitted on the ground of insanity and received back on April 1Ith under order of the Chief Commissioner. 7. Of the 12 discharged, 8 were cured, 2 made over to their friends im- proved, 1 not improved, and 1 escaped. Of the 8 cured, 2 were non-criminals, 1 male and 1 female, the former a sowar, and the latter Sohodra, mentioned in paragraph 4. The rest were criminals, 4 males and 2 females. Of these 1 male Nanapergasam, a murderer, was sent to the Central Jail by order of the Chief Commissioner, the others made over to their friends on these giving security for good behaviour of those released. Of the two non-criminal males discharged improved, one Gopala Patel had been in the asylum since 1871, was quite quiet and harmless, though still subject to hallucinations about money. The other, Sukhya, was made over to his father very much better. The female discharged not improved, was taken away by her husband, a Native Christian in Nagpur, with the consent of the visitors of the asylum. 8. Non-criminal lunatic Dhonsai æt 30, a beggar from Raipur, quite quiet and harmless, escaped from a gang working on the farm on April 10, having been 11 months in the asylum and much improved. An Eurasian female, wife of a Railway guard, was under observation for 26 days pending her removal to Colaba Asylum on the 16th December. 9. Statement III. gives the religion and sex of those admitted as well as the districts from which they were received. As usual the Hindus out-number the Mahomedans, and three Gonds are included "under other castes." 5 were admitted from the Nagpur district, 4 from each of the districts, Chanda and Raipur, and 1 from each3 observation. The three cases of acute mania have all exhibited true maniacal symptoms. One committed murder whilst under excitement, the other two have had fits of excitement,4 lum since 1871; inclined to attack others on slight provocation. In 1881 suf- fered from remittent fever, but had improved in health during the early part of 1882, increasing 16½ lbs. in weight in 3 months ending 9th March. On March 16th, during a sudden quarrel, when employed at brick-making, was thrown down, and died almost immediately from ruptured spleen. The warder under whose charge he was at the time was prosecuted and punished by imprisonment. 15. Statements IX., X., and XI. are financial, and I believe will be consid- ered satisfactory. The figures have been compared with the accounts in the Comp- troller's office and found to be correct. The receipts in 1882 were Rs. 9,060-10-5 as compared with Rs. 8,832-4-7 in 1881, and the expenditure excluding charges of the Public Works and Printing departments was Rs. 9,656-11-2 against Rs. 9,515-10-3. The amount actually received from the Treasury was Rs. 8,388 as compared with Rs. 8,034, and from paying patients Rs. 326 instead of Rs. 396. This latter sum would have been more, but the Commissioner ruled that the Government was not justified in compelling a father to pay for the maintenance of a son of adult age whom the Committee of Visitors refused to make over to the father's care on account of the dangerous character of his disease. The father has since died leaving a considerable estate, and a younger brother who inherits has agreed to pay Rs. 5 a month for the lunatic's maintenance. The amount credited to the manufactory is Rs. 345-13-6 instead of Rs. 402. In 1882 a pair of bullocks was sold for Rs. 100, and during the year under review a single bullock was sold for Rs. 45. On the expenditure side the cost of establishment proper was Rs. 2,579-15-0 as compared with Rs. 2,207-2-11, but in 1882 the pay of December 1881 was drawn in January and Rs. 2,579-15-0 represents an expenditure for 13 months. The diet purchased in the market cost Rs. 2,537-7-4 against Rs 2,487-11-1 in 1881, but calculating the food supplied by the asylum the cost of the year was Rs. 2,973-0-2 compared with Rs. 3,156-7-3 in 1881. As in former years I have had the nerik rates compared with the money paid for food in the wholesale bazar, and have calculated a saving to Govern- ment of Rs. 382-6-1 during the year. Nothing was paid in cash for clothing, but Rs. 239-6-9 debited inter-depart- mentally,5 Annual Report on the Lunatic Asylum, Jubbulpore, for the year 1882. Table I. is a Statement showing generally the admissions and results for the past 11 years. In 1882, as in 1881, 28 were admitted,6 I am afraid that the number of this class under treatment must of neces- sity steadily increase. Most of them are confined on account of acts which prove them to be dangerous to themselves or to the public. Although many cases occur in which there are grounds for supposing that reason has been restored after a longer or shorter time in the asylum, the visitors hesitate to accept the responsibility of letting them loose on society, their antecedents placing them in a category greatly different from that of harmless lunatics. The daily average strength was 27.14 against 24.76 for 1881. Of the 7 admitted during the year 5 are males and 2 females. Of the 5 males one was tried at Hoshangabad for murdering his wife with an axe, and acquitted by the Sessions Judge on the ground of his being insane when he committed that act. One was charged at Damoh, under Act V of 1861, with indecently exposing his person and committing nuisances in public places : he was found incapable of making his defence and sent to the asylum. One was a prisoner on account of theft and undergoing a sentence of two years' imprisonment in the Mandla Jail when it was found that he was insane and transferred to the asylum under Act V of 1871, One was confined in the Central Jail, Jubbulpore, under trial for theft and considered insane by the Medical Officer : his transfer was ordered by the Local Government under Section 426, Criminal Procedure Code. One was transferred from Seoni under similar circumstances. The 2 females were transferred, one from the Jubbulpore and the other from the Seoni Jail, by order of the Local Government under Section 426, Criminal Procedure Code, in each instance being incapable of pleading to a charge of theft. The female re-admitted comes from Hoshangabad district ; she was admitted on the 27th September 1881, charged with the murder of her newly born child, ten days' old. The Medical Officer pronounced her incapable of making her defence. She soon grew better, and by the end of the year was pronounced by the official visitors sane and capable of pleading, and on the 12th January 1882 transferred to Hoshangabad to undergo her trial. She was acquitted on the ground of insanity. She continues up to this quite quiet, rational, obedient and easily manageable, but of course is unfit for discharge, as this may be no more than a lucid interval, instances of which are very common in this asylum. Lunatics after being ap- parently cured for two or more years have become violent and dangerous under a re-accession of the mental derangements for which they were originally admitted, sometimes just after discharge but in most instances without any assignable cause. Table III. shows the religion, sex and districts of the new admissions. Of the 31 admissions and re-admissions 25 are Hindus, simply what one should expect in a country where the Hindu population so largely preponderate. The Christian is a Madrassi half-caste, an orphan, aged about 20 years, who suddenly became subject to delusions, grew mischievous and was a nuisance generally to his neighbours. He is much improved, and I hope in a few months will be fit for discharge. Of the whole number admitted 16, or more than half, came from Jubbul- pore. This is to be expected, because when there is a reasonable presumption that a person is insane, he or she is at once sent for treatment. There happens to be a Lunatic Asylum here, and the patient may as well (if not better) be treated there as in an ordinary hospital. It is always provided that I see the
7 cases first and that I have grounds for considering the asylum the more suitable place for them. In other districts persons thought to be insane are kept for a longer or a shorter time under the observation of the Civil Surgeon, and doubt- less many get better or are made over to their friends. Besides for various reasons the neighbourhood of a large city increases the number of lunatics, especially of wandering or homeless lunatics, who drift to this place with the stream of travellers always tending towards it. Table IV. shows the occupation of those admitted. 8 were habitual beggars. 5 8 10 cases remained under treatment at the close of 1881, 48 were admitted into hospital during the year against 86 for the year preceding, or about one- third of the total population. This indicates a very healthy condition of the inmates, 16 were for fevers, chiefly ordinary country ague; and 10 for bowel complaints. There were three cases of double pneumonia, to which lunatics are much predisposed : they were all, as may be supposed, very severe cases, and one ended fatally. 53 were discharged cured, one was made over to his friends while a patient in hospital for paralysis. There appeared to be no chance of any further improvement from special treatment, he was harmless and they were able and willing to care for him. Four died, or a little over 30 per 1,000, which is less than the death rate of the free population. 1 from pneumonia, 2 from chronic dysentery with ulcera- tion of the bowels, 1 died from cerebral exhaustion, simulating acute atrophy of the brain, the result of acute mania following an attack of continued fever, probably of a thermal nature. He was a chaprassi in the Commissioner's office and had been ill for several days with continued fever; when the fever left him he was found to be insane, wild, talkative, trying to break away from hisfriends. He was in this state when brought to the asylum on the 7th October. He appeared then worn and exhausted, his pulse was thready, he suffered from complete insomnia. He was treated with bromide of potash, cannabis indica, hydrate of chloral, quinine, and iron and as much nourishing food and stimulants as he could be got to take. He sunk gradually and died 17 days after admission, quite worn out. No post mortem was allowed. The daily average number sick was only 2.35 against 9.47 for the year pre- ceding ; or one 1.7 per cent of average strength against 7.5 for the previous year. The mortality was as the rate of 30 per 1,000 per annum on the average strength, against 71 per 1,000 for the year 1881. Table IX. shows the expenditure from all sources incurred in maintaining the asylum. We had to ask for Rs. 8,130 only from the Treasury against Rs. 8,424 in 1881 and Rs. 9,170-1.4 in 1880. Although the daily strength was 5 in excess above 1881 and 6 over 1880. There has been a steady decrease in the cost of management during the past three years, as will be seen from the subjoined table. In 1881 and 1882 the clothing had to be renewed, the quality of the articles received from the Central Jail was not good enough to resist the violent action of lunatics! 1882. 1881. 1880. Rs A. P.

9 In this comparative Statement I have left out paying-patients from both sides of the account : to include them would be a source of error. They paid for the whole cost of their maintenance ; as they were not criminals they were allowed by the visitors such reasonable indulgences as their friends chose to pay for; for example one man is allowed ½ an anna worth of sweetmeats daily : another a seer of fresh milk ; a third has a servant to cook for him ; another has broad-cloth clothing, &c. &c.; to charge these on either side of the account would vitiate calculations, the object of which is to show how much it costs the State to maintain a pauper lunatic. Statement X. shows the strength of the establishment as it stood on the last day of the year. It is below the sanctioned scale by 2 " Jemadars" or Head Warders, and 1 male and 2 female keepers, or 5 individuals in all, whose aggregate salary would be Rs. 408 per annum. I explained last year how little useful the " Head Warders" were : we did very well without them this year. The sanctioned scale of keepers is 1 to every 10 or portion of 10 inmates. Table XI. deals with manufactures As explained in former reports there is not a very large field for operations in this direction. Out of a total average of 131 we were able to employ 54 daily on more or less remunerative work. The net profits of their earnings amounted to Rs. 713-3-6. Amongst other work we were this year able to manufacture all the clothing required for the Lunatics. They also turned out some excellent blankets, dosutti and newar for sale to the public. It should not be supposed that the remaining 87 individuals were all idle. Some 12 are employed in cooking, as many more in cleaning, sifting, and grind- ing wheat; about 20 are employed in collecting, pounding, sifting and storing dry earth for the latrines and wards, of which a great deal is used daily : 8 or 10 are employed in sweeping and cleaning up the premises, which are at all times notoriously clean and neat. Between 30 and 40 are imbeciles or too violent to do any work. The num- ber of these is increasing year by year, whilst the best and most profitable are lost to us of necessity by being discharged cured or made over to their friends. To return to our manufactures. We sold to the public articles to the value of ... Rs. 576 12 7 We made over to the Asylum for asylum purposesSTATEMENTS.

STATEMENT No. XIREPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES. FOR THE YEAR 1883. NAGPUR: PRINTED AT THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER 'S OFFICE PRESS. 1884.
No.4864a/235 FROM LINDSAY NEILL, ESQUIRE, C. S., SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. To THE DEPUTY SURGEON GENERAL, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 10th October 1884. SIR, I am directed to acknowledge your letter No. 2982-C. C., dated 26th May, submitting the Annual Report and Statements of the Nagpur and Jubbul- pore Lunatic Asylums for the year 1883. 2. On the 1st January 1883 there were 109 inmates, (84 males and 25 females) in the Nagpur Asylum; admissions numbered 16, (10 males, 6 females), and readmissions 4, (all males), so that the total population was 129, (98 males, 31 females). Five inmates (3 males, 2 females) were discharged, and 3 males are shown as discharged " otherwise ", and four (2 males, 2 females) died, so that there remained on the last day of the year 117, (90 males and 27 females). The daily average strength was 113, and the daily average sick 9.45. Of the three males discharged " otherwise," two seem to be incorrectly shown. One'did not leave the Asylum, his classification only being changed,2 ber of cured in one Asylum, and the small number in the other; but it is observed that of 15 males discharged as 'cured' at Jubbulpore, 3 had to be readmitted as insane. You seem to think that '' cures " depend greatly on the individual opinion of the Superintendent, and very properly recall to mind, that at Nagpur Surgeon Major Barter succeoded Brigade Surgeon Brake as Superintendent. There is weight in the remark, that the individual opinion of a Superintendent has much influence, but it does not fully explain the discrepant results at the two Asylums. Speaking generally. the only authorities competent to discharge lunatics are the Visitors, a Magistrate and the Local Government, and the individual opinion of the Superintendent is not paramount. 4. The tendency is to gradual increase in the number of criminal lunatics in the Asylums. In 1873-74, the number was only 22, which has since gradu- ally risen. On the 1st January 1883, there were 57 (46 males, 11 females) in the two Asylums; there were 9 admissions (8 males, 1 female), and 5 read- missions (4 males, 1 female), making a total of 71. Eleven (8 males, 3 females) were discharged, transferred, &c. during the year, and three, (2 males, 1 female) died ; leaving on the 31st December 1883, 57 criminal lunatics,No. 2982/C. C. FROM J. H. LOCH, ESQUIRE, M. D., Deputy Surgeon General, Central Provinces. To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, 26th May 1884. SIR, I have the honor to forward the Annual Reports and Statements of the Nagpur and Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylums for the year 1883. 2. During the year the Nagpur Asylum had more admissions (including re-admissions), fewer discharges (including deaths), and a daily average strength higher by 5 than in 1882. 3. The Jubbulpore Asylum with fewer admissions (including re-admis- sions), and a very much larger number of discharges (including deaths), had still a daily average strength higher than that of 1882 by 6 ; the cause being that on the 1st January 1883, there were 18 more inmates than on the 1st January 1882. 4. There was not any overcrowding in either the men's or women's wards of either of the Asylums. 5. The proportion of " cured" was unusually small at the Nagpur Asylum, but in reviewing this year's working of this institution, it is necessary as regards "cures'', and other points settled mainly by the individual opinion of the Super- intendent, to remember that that officer was changed during the year. 6. At Jubbulpore the number of " cures" was larger than it has been during the past 4 years, while the percentages of such to strength and admissions were larger than they had been for many years. 7. The deaths at Nagpur numbered the same as in 1882, at Jubbulpore they were 50 per cent. more, or judged by the percentage to average strength they were in 1883 at Nagpur almost the same, at Jubbulpore, 1 more. 8. The re-admissions were higher than usual at both Asylums, the number (5) at Jubbulpore being the highest recorded during the past 11 years. This larger number of re-admissions taken in connection with the unusually large number of cures makes one suspect that, patients may have been discharged sooner than was wise, and Dr. Rice's Report shows that, of the 5 re-admitted, 2 criminals had a return of insanity before they had even stood their trial, and 1 non-criminal had a return of the disease some months after his discharge. At Nagpur only 1 of the 4 re-admitted was " after cure" the others being really transfers from one class of patients to another. 9. Statement II deals with criminals only, and shows that at both the Asylums the admissions were somewhat fewer, and the daily average strength somewhat larger than in 1882. The Jubbulpore Asylum had the largest criminal population and daily strength it has ever had.
( 2 ) 10. It is impossible to draw any useful conclusions regarding the particu- lars given in Statements III and IV, on account of the very small proportion of the lunatic population treated in our Asylums, and the impossibility of obtaining from most of the " Beggar" lunatics any reliable information as to their pre- vious history. 11. Statement V shows as usual that the age between 20 and 40 is that at which by far the largest number of insanes are admitted to Asylums. 12. As regards the types of insanity under which the patients in the Asy- lums were labouring, as shewn in Statement VI, we may with confidence com- pare those of the Jubbulpore Asylum in different years, for it has had the same Superintendent for long, but it is not so with those of the Nagpur Asylum in the superintendence of which (as I have already remarked) a change took place. For the same reason it will not do to compare too closely the types met with at Nag- pore with those found at Jubbulpore, especially as regards the chronic cases in which it is often very difficult to decide from which type a patient is suffering. 13. Mania, including both the acute and chronic forms, was the type under which by far the largest number of patients admitted in 1883, was suffering, as is, I think, the case in most Indian Asylums ; a large number of these cases being really cases of poisoning by Ganja or other preparations of Indian hemp. 14. The great difference in the ratio of Mania cases returned as " acute" and as " chronic'' at the two Asylums is, I should think, most likely due to dif- ference of diagnosis only. 15. The difference in the number of idiots is no doubt due to the causes mentioned by Dr. Rice and the large number remaining, and the small mortality among them at Jubbulpore speak well for the care and attention bestowed on the patients in that Asylum. 16. As to the causes, Statement VII ; in a large proportion of the patients, no information can be obtained, and in the case of many the information supplied to Superintendents is not reliable, so that little value can be placed on this State- ment, except that it shows, as in former years, that Ganja is the most common cause of admissions into the Asylums. 17. As regards the numbers that recover, the proportion among those whose insane state was produced by Ganja is, in the two Asylums together, nearly three times as many as that among those insane from all the other causes. 18. The amount of sickness shewn in statement VIII compares favorably with that treated in 1882 at both Asylums, as with more inmates there were fewer sick. The average daily ratio of sick has been very much less at Jubbulpore than at Nagpur during the past two years, the difference being due rather to a re- duction at Jubbulpore than an increase at Nagpur. The difference at the two Asylums this year has been due, chiefly, to the very much larger number of cases of fever, dysentery and diarrhæa, treated at Nagpur than at Jubbulpore, the numbers being:( 3 ) 20. As regards Financial Statements IX, X and XI, I would only remark that, the large out-turn of the garden farm and manufactory at both Asylums i-, from a medical point of view, highly commendable, as it shews that the Superins tendents have not only employed the patients largely on labour of various kinds, but that the labour must have been useful, and such as would interest and so help on the cure of those engaged in it. 21. I make no remarks on increased accommodation mooted by Dr. Rice, Finance, Establishment, &c, as these and all other questions relating to the mange- ment of the Asylums are under the orders of the Inspector General of Jails ( by whom the statements, as they are submitted, have been prepared and forwarded to me for review) but confine myself to those which are medical. I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient servant, JAMES H. LOCH, M. D., Deputy Surgeon General, Central Provinces.
( 4 ) Annual Report on the Lunatic Asylum Jubbulpore, for the year 1883. As is customary this Report takes the form of brief comments on each of the 11 Statements furnished annually. TABLE I is a general Statement giving the number remaining at the end of the year : the new admissions : the results of treatment &c. : both for the year under review and for the ten years preceding it. 21 (18 males and 3 females) were new admissions and 5(4 males and 1 female) were re-admissions. Of the latter 3 (2 males and 1 female) were criminal lunatics who had been declared by the official visitors capable of making their defence : one was tried and re-admitted into the Asylum under Section 471 of Criminal Procedure Code and the other two had a relapse before their trial came on and were sent back. Of the remain- ing two, one escaped and was re-captured after some months : the other was dis- charged apparently cured, but after some months, his insanity recurred and he was re-admitted. The total population dealt with numbered 168, the highest during the past five years : due altogether to our having begun the year with a high remaining number, viz. 142 against 124 for the year preceding 29 (23 males and 6 females) were discharged under the following heads. Cured 20 (15 males and 5 females) improved 4 (3 males and 1 female), not improved 3 males, escaped 2 males. Of the 15 males, insanity has since recurred in 3 and they have been re-admitted in the others as far as one can ascertain the cure appears to have been of a more permanent nature. There has been no relapse amongst the females. All of the 4 discharged '' improved " were harmless imbeciles : they together with 3 others " not improved '', were made over to their friends under the provi- sions of Chief Commissioner's Book Circular No. XXXI. of 1877, they were harmless, and not likely to derive any benefit from a residence in the Asylum certainly there was no hope of a complete cure. Two escaped of whom one was recaptured after about six months: the other is still at large. The Asylum is very open: a large number are employed in the garden protected only with a weak "mehndi" hedge with the city close by, within the mazes of which a person very soon gets lost, so that this number of escapes is not remarkable. 6 died : details of whose death will be given further on under table 8. The year closed with 133 (99 males and 34 females) remaining in the Asylum against 142 for the year preceding. The daily average number confined wss 137.20 (101.98 males and 35.22 females.) The greatest number confined on any one night was 148 or within 13 of the full capacity of the Asylum. This points to the necessity for more care in send- ing lunatics to the Asylum as directed in the Book Circular above quoted; other- wise it may happen that there will be no room for violent or dangerous lunatics, or for those who may be suffering from temporary insanity and likely to be cured quicker in an Institution of this kind specially devoted to the management of the insane than in a general hospital which possesses scarcely one condition requisite for their treatment. I do not refer to those harmless imbeciles whose cure is hopeless and who had best be left to the care of their friends: if they have none, then a Poor House is the proper place for them : if there is no Poor House there are very few Sadr Dispensaries where an out of the way corner could not be found for them, and I would venture to say absolutely none where a small detached room could not be put up at a trifling expense ; the greater part of it would in a little time be covered by the cost of sending them to Jubbulpore.
( 5 ) TABLE II. Deals with the Criminal Lunatics : the total number of this class treated is steadily increasing : although at the end of the year the number remaining was less by 2, the daily average number in the Asylum during the year exceeded that preceding by almost as many. 5 (4 males and 1 female) were new admissions against 7 for the year 1882. 3 (2 males and 1 female) were re-admitted one after trial under Section 471 Criminal Procedure Code, in the other two there was a relapse before their trial could take place and they were sent back, but they were no real addition as they were only discharged temporarily. Of the new admissions 4 (3 males and 1 female) were charged with murder, and 1, a male, with theft. The cases in which murder occurred are very illustrative of the way in which the homicidal impulse takes possession of the individual, the gratification of which appearing to remove many of the signs of insanity and to be attended with a general amelioration of thir mental state. They also present the general character of a crime committed while reason is dethroned :( 6 ) credit, although of course not to be altogether discredited on that account : they also talk of " Sore eyes" being the immediately exciting cause of the attempt. While in the Asylum she has steadily grown more and more rational : in July she was pronounced capable of making her defence, and was afterwards tried and acquitted on the ground that she was insane when she committed the offence. She is now in the Asylum under Section 471 Criminal Procedure Code, but the Official Visitors recently recommended that she should be made over to her friends being quite rational and apparently harmless. The total number of Criminal Lunatics dealt with was 38, the largest since the Asylum was opened even after deducting the three who were re-admitted, who as I have already explained were no real addition to the number. Of the 8 discharged : 4 (1 male and 3 females) were discharged cured Two males were discharged for trial in a lucid interval: but had another outbreak before their trial could take place One escaped about 4 months ago and has not since been re-captured. And one was transferred to the non-criminal list under provisions of Section 31, Act V of 1871, the term of imprisonment to which he had, in the first instance, been sentenced having expired. Two died leaving 28 in the Asylum at the end of the year. Of these 5 are always violent and dangerous and have to be kept perma- nently locked up, of whom 1 is a female, who however managed to escape doing any greater harm to society than committing thefts. 7 (3 males and 4 females) have been violent and dangerous only occasionally, and 13 (10 males and 3 females) get violent and excited without being dangerous ; while three males are at all times perfectly harmless imbeciles and kept in the Asylum chiefly because they are incapable of taking care of themselves and no persons can be found who are willing to take care of them. It is remarkable how large is the proportion of the women who are apt to become violent and dangerous. The daily average number was 29.06 (20.47 males and 8.59 females ) TABLE III. gives the religion, sex, and districts from which patients are admitted. There is little calling for remark except that the proportion of " Christians'' is larger than usual. They consist of two Madrasies annd one Goanese. Jubbulpore though still at the head of the other Districts according to the numbers sent for treatment. is not nearly so much ahead as in former years : I don't know why this should be. I am not aware that during the past year more caution was used in sending lunatics to the Asylum : I am not aware that more was necessary. It has been explained in former Reports how, in other districts, it may- be that supposed lunatics recovered their reason before there was an opportunity of sending them to Jubbulpore. It should also be borne in mind that the popula- tion is larger, close on 700,000 while most of the others have 300,000 to 500,000. Perhaps it will be as well to suggest here that there appears to be some necessity for reminding District Officers generally of the orders contained in Chief Commissioner's Book Circular No. XXXI of 1877, in which they are en- joined not to send in to the Asylum harmless lunatics. The capacity of the Asylum is limited : there are no means of extending it temporarily: this year we were once within 13 of being completely full: on two occasions the females wards were quite full. If then those harmless lunatics are sent in the place will have to be closed against those who may be a danger to themselves or to society, and whose restraint in a suitable place becomes imperative. The Official Visitors have striven on occasions in this direction but their efforts have not always been suc- cessful.
( 7 ) The Rules for the transmission of lunatics from outlying districts, published with the Lunatic Asylum Manual( 8 ) ceremonies constantly ejaculates " Ram Ram Seeta Ram". Another Sardha, a Kachi by caste, since dead, was constantly praying to Dhula Deo : and to Debi, exclaiming that the above alone could cure him : he practiced ascetism in many little ways especially in complete abstinence from the chewing or smoking of tobacco, a very unsual piece of self denial in a lunatic. One Jugmohun Brahmin is a Pundit and labours under intense religious excitement always fussing about his puja ceremonial and wanting all sorts of impossible things. More than half the complete cures occurred in those whose insanity was at- tributed to ganga : this is reasonable enough on the principal that withdrawal of the cause led to the disappearance of the effect. I do not think the mortality was in any way connected with the particular cause of insanity in those who died. STATEMENT No. VIII. treats of the bodily ailments 41 (36 males and 5 females) were treated during the year. The daily average number sick was only 1.53 Bearing in mind that scarcely a case admitted into the Asylum is free from sickness in some shape or form, this return would argue a wonderfully good state of health in the inmates of any institution : it is particularly remarkable in a Lunatic Asylum. I have noted when Bowel Complaints and Fevers were pre- valent in the city and Central Jail, that the Asylum enjoyed almost complete immunity from these diseases and the cases that occured were of a mild type. As usual Fever (8), Bowel Complaints (6), and Inflammation of the Lungs (4) were the most common. There is nothiùg calling for remark. The broken ribs and broken arms were caused by the lunatics in each instance: the men were attacked by others and thrown down, the fractures occurred in the scuffle. The assailants in both cases were men who, though not given to violence, were excitable and imprudently allowed out of their cells by the Deputy Superintend- ent, a new man who was acting for the permanent incumbent. In both cases some provocation was given by the injured men. Hydrophobia ... ... ... 1 General Paralysis ... ... 1 Pneumonia ... ... ... 1 Dysentery ... ... ... 1 Spasm of the Colon ... ... 1 Debility ... ... ... 1 Six died against 4 for the year preceding. I give the causes of death in the margin ; the deaths from Hydrophobia and Spasm of the Colon are so unusual in an institution of this kind that they may be almost said to be accidental. The neighbourhood of the Asylum is infested with pariah dogs, the numbers of which the Police or any one else appears to be unable to keep down: it is a common thing daily for two or three to " Scurry'' through the Asylum premises. In July the deceased lunatic was bitten in the hand ; the wound was cauterised at once although the persons who saw the dog declared he was not mad : in September he died with well marked symptoms of Hydrophobia: he was one of three fatal cases from the same disease within an area of ? of a mile square, within a period of six weeks: the third being a European Fitter in the G. I. P. workshops. The case of Spasm of the Colon occured in a voilent lunatic who had to be kept locked up; he was seized with it during a time when the weather was cold and damp : it was next to impossible to get him to keep on his clothes: he could almost rival the Davenport Brothers in extricating himself from clothes and handcuffs : if his hands were handcuffed behind his back he could in a minute wriggle himself between his arms and bring them to the front ! He was under treatment with opium, belladona and the " Long-tube" for three days, but nothing brought relief. It was found on a post mortem examination that 15 inches of the descending Colon and Sigmoid flexure were rigidly contracted into a rope like structure the thickness of ones forefinger : no one part appeared tighter than the others : the whole 15 inches were tightly constricted.

We drew from the Treasury Rs. 7,842-15-2, against Rs. 8,130 in 1882. The decrease in the cost of management noted last year( 10 ) Annual Report on the Lunatic Asylum Nagpur, for the year 1883. TABLE I. There is no striking difference between the figures for the year under report and those for 1882, nor do the figures point to anything unusual in the year's his- tory demanding special comment; a few general remarks on them will there- fore be sufficient. The number in the Asylum then at the commencement of the year was almost similar to that for 1882. 109 as against 110, or 20 less than in 1878, which year showed the highest number for the decade. During the past four years admissions have been much fewer than formerly, thus 16, 14 and 13 as against 38, 37, and 33 showing that greater care has of late years been taken in sending to the Asylum those only who cannot properly be cared for outside by their friends. The total population was just in excess of the previous two years but much lower than formerly; thus 125 STATEMENT III. 8. Of the 20 admissions, the Nagpur district furnished thirteen. Nagpur City and Kamptee with their population of nearly 150,000 furnished nine of these. To these centres lunatics sometimes wander, or at any rate they are there found without friends. STATEMENT IV. 9. Of the five persons shown in this Statement as beggars, three are so returned, having been found wandering about without friends, and two were professional beggars. Eighteen of the twenty admitted were under forty years of age when received, fifteen being between twenty and forty, see Statement 5. STATEMENT VI. 10. The types of insanity were, with eleven exceptions, registered by my predecessors in office who have in previous report given details of those who came under their care up to the end of 1882 ; of those admitted in 1883, eleven suffered from mania, and seven from dementia, one from melancholia, and one is shown as not insane. The man committed murder while insane, he recovered from the attack, was acquitted on the ground of insanity and transferred to the Asylum, he is now free from apparent mental disease. 11. The causes of insanity as shown in Statement 7 are given by the transferring officer, they are not satisfactory, but there is great difficulty some- times in reaching the truth of those cases, and in five nothing whatever could be ascertained. 12. This shows receipts minus proceeds of cash sales; these are given separately under column 4, Statement XI. Owing chiefly to cheaper food, cash received from the treasury was less than in 1882; receipts from paying patients were less by Rs. 39-2-11. The details of column 4 receipts are thus made up :STATEMENTS.

REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES FOR THE YEAR 1884. NAGPUR: PRINTED AT THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE PRESS. 1885.
No. 3095/160 FROM A. H. L. FRASER, ESQUIRE, C. S., OFFG. SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. TO THE DEPUTY SURGEON GENERAL, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 15th August 1885. SIR, I am directed to acknowledge your letter No. 3962 C. C., dated 9th ultimo, forwarding the Reports of the Superintendents of the Nagpur and Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylums on the working of these institutions for the year 1884. 2. It is unnecessary for the Chief Commissioner to reproduce here the figures clearly set forth in the statements appended to the reports or to attempt any criticism of the Medical administration of these institutions. There has been no overcrowding, though the number of inmates at Nagpur has been greatly increased by transfers from Berar. The Superintendents and the visitors of both Asylums appear to have discharged their respective duties satisfactorily. The lunatics are kept as comfortable and clean as possible, are well fed and well housed, and have been comparatively healthy. 8. The figures showing the types of insanity show as usual great differences between the two asylums. The principal differences are2 The ages of these thirty when admitted to Nagpur were :No. 3962 C. C. FROM JAMES H. LOCH, ESQUIRE, M.D., DEPUTY SURGEON GENERAL, Central Provinces. TO THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. THROUGH INSPECTOR GENERAL OF PRISONS, C. P., Dated Nagpur, the 9th July 1885. SIR, I have the honor to forward for submission to the Chief Commis- sioner the Annual Reports and Statements of the Nagpur and Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylums for the year 1884. 2. During the year the Berars Asylum was closed, and the inmates trans- ferred to that at Nagpur. 3. Before the reception of the lunatics from the Berars, certain alterations in, and additions to the buildings of the Nagpur Asylum had been sanctioned. These are fully described in the Superintendent's report, and have rendered the Asylum much better fitted for the detention and treatment of lunatics. The levelling, &c, carried out at Nagpur by the patients are real improve- ments in a sanitary point of view. The alterations to the wards at Jubbulpore are also such as to greatly improve the Asylum, not only by increasing its capacity, but also by rendering the wards more suited to the purpose for which they are used. 4. During the year at the Nagpur Asylum the number admitted (including those re-admitted), the number discharged (including those who died), and the daily average strength were all larger than in 1883. The increased number of admissions was due chiefly to the transfer of the (30) lunatics from the Berars, but, exclusive of these, the number of patients admitted from the Central Provinces was larger than in 1883. At Jubbulpore the number of admissions (including re-admissions) was only a little over half what it was in 1883, and less than it had been in any of the preceding 10 years except 1880 : the number discharged (including those who died) was also very much smaller, and the daily average strength somewhat lower than in 1883. 5. There was not at any time any overcrowding in either the men's or women's wards in either of the Asylums. 6. At Nagpur the number cured was the same as in 1883, which with the larger daily average strength gives a rather lower percentage. At Jubbulpore the cures were only 8 as compared with 20 last year: the per- centage (of cures) to strength being in 1883 ... ... ... 28 per cent in 1884 ... ... ... 5 2 The percentage of cures is slightly higher at Jubbulpore than at Nagpur. The following figures show the average percentage of cured to admitted in the Asylums of the Central Provinces and other Provinces to whose reports I have access. Province. Year. Total admitted. Total cured. Percentage of cured to admitted. Bengal ... ... 1879 to 1883 5,522 440 7.9 Madras ... ... 2,801 365 13.0 Bombay ... ... 4,536 427 9.4 Punjab ... ... 2,245 258 11.5 Central Provinces ... 1,430 88 6.1 Burmah ... ... 1882 & 1884 ... 494 51 10.3 Assam ... ... 1880 to 1884... 394 51 12.9 Central Provinces ... 1884 321 13 4.0 It will be thus seen that the ratio of cured for the past 5 years and for 1884 is less in the Central Provinces than in any other Province; but the very low ratio for the year 1884 is accounted for partly at least by the admission to the Nagpur Asylum of a large number of chronic incurable cases among the lunatics from the Berars. 7. The deaths at Nagpur were 1 per cent to strength more than in 1883, while at Jubbulpore the ratio was only 3 per cent, the lowest that has been recorded since 1877. 8. Re-admissions were fewer than in 1883 at both Asylums. Of the 3 patients re-admitted to the Nagpur Asylum, one was sent back for safe custody after acquittal Of the other (two), 1 who had been sent to stand his trial was found on arrival at the station to which he was sent to have relapsed into insanity as he had done on former occasions: the other was sent back to Jail improved, but again became insane, and had to be re-admitted at the end of 6 months. The two patients re-admitted at Jubbulpore were lunatic idiots who had been discharged by the visitors as not fit (under provisions of Chief Commis- sioner's Book Circular No. 31 of 1877) to be detained in an Asylum. The re-admissions at Nagpur this year taken together with those at Jubbul- pore last year, show what care should be exercised in the discharge of cases of chronic insanity from our Asylums. STATEMENT II. 9. The transfer of the Berar lunatics caused an unusually large number of criminals to be admitted to the Nagpur Asylum, while at Jubbulpore only 2 patients of this class were admitted and none re-admitted. STATEMENT III. 10. Of the 10 districts in the Central Provinces whose lunatics are admitted to the Nagpur Asylum, each sent one or more patients in 1884,3 STATEMENTS V. & VI. 12. As the Superintendent of the Nagpur Asylum does not state in his report whether the ages of the Berar lunatics, and their types of insanity as given in his returns, are those entered when they were admitted to the Berar or Nagpur Asylum, it is even more than usually hopeless to draw any conclusion as to the age and type of insanity which yield the largest number of patients. With reference to the figures in Statement VI. of the Nagpur Asylum, the differences between the number of lunatics laboring under each type of insanity this year and last are explained by the Superintendent in his report. Undoubtedly the case of each lunatic should be gone over carefully at least once a year with the special object of, if necessary, changing his type of insanity in the registers ; but I think all changes from one type to another should be entered in the result " otherwise" (Statement VI), and a footnote of the num- ber changed from each type to another appended. This would allow the " remained " of each year to tally with the " remain- ing on 31st December" of the previous year under each type, which it does not do in the present year's statement for the Nagpur Asylum. It would also afford information that is interesting to those dealing with insanity. I need not repeat what I said in paragraphs 15, 16, and 17 of last year's letter regarding idiots; my remarks there hold good for this year also. The following figures show the percentage of " recoveries " from each of the more common types of insanity in the Asylums of other Provinces, as well as in those of the Central Provinces:4 The following figures show the percentage of admissions and of recoveries under each of the most commonly alleged causes of insanity for the Central Provinces and other Provinces :5 These figures bring out very clearly the large proportion of insanity due to the excessive use of Indian hemp, and show that in half of the cases the cause cannot be traced. The proportion of recoveries in the case of patients whose insanity is attri- buted to the use of ganja is, it will be noticed, very much smaller in this Pro- vince than it is in most of the other Provinces. Statement VIII. 14. The daily average number of sick at Nagpur is (with a much larger population) considerably less than in 1883. At Jubbulpore the number is about the same. But, as was the case in the two previous years, the number of sick treated in the Nagpur Asylum is very much larger than that treated at Jubbulpore; the percentage of sick to daily strength being:Annual Report on the the Nagpur Lunatic Asylum, for the year 1884. STATEMENT I. The Berar Asylum having been closed in July under orders of the Government of India, 28 males and 2 females were transferred to Nagpur; an unusual increase is therefore shown in the number of admissions with reference to previous years. 27 males were admitted on the 27th of July, and 1 male and 2 females on subsequent dates; 12 were criminals : of the whole 2 were lepers, and 9 practised such extremely filthy habits that it was necessary to confine them separately for a time; constant talking to and the behaviour of Nagpur lunatics has been the means of some improvement; six were very troublesome. The want of space in Berar necessitated probably the admission of bad cases only. 2. Twenty-two males and 2 females were admitted from the Central Prov- inces and 3 were re-admitted, total 27. The histories of those re-admitted are these : Govinda, accused of assault, was considered fit to stand his trial ; he was therefore tried, and was acquitted on the ground of insanity, but as his friends declined to take charge of him he was sent back to the Asylum. Derha Gond was considered also fit to make his defence, but on arrival at Raipur, as on two previous occasions, he relapsed into his former state of insanity, and so was re-transferred to the Asylum. Shaik Turab, received from the Nagpur Jail in July 1883, was sent back in July 1884, but having again relapsed into his former condition he was re-transferred to the Asylum in December. 3. Altogether 174 came under treatment; and of these, fifteen were dis- charged, thus: 3 males and 2 females cured, 2 males improved, and one not improved, made over to their friends ; 2 escaped ; 2 were transferred to the Nag- pur Jail improved, and 3 were sent to stand their trial : 2 of the last and one transferred to jail were re-admitted within the year. Five males and one female died ; one of the men was in a bad state on admission, his friends tied him by the elbows and ankles so tightly that the parts were enormously swollen : on admission they sloughed and suppurated so profusely that he sank 22 days afterwards ; one died from diarrh2 reduced in size to accommodate about ten sick persons, and similarly remodelled in regard to openings and latrine accommodation, extra space being thrown into the larger ward. These works were almost, if not entirely, out of hand at the close of the year, and the following were in progress. 6. " Hospital and convalescent ward" and "European ward," see report for 1874. These are small bungalows formerly occupied by Sergeants, and are exactly the same size. Some cross walls have been taken down in each, thereby increasing space, and roof ventilators are being set up, projecting night latrines were constructed, and the iron-barred openings are being made more secure in one of them. 7. The female block consists of a centre ward, a narrow room at one end, and a cell and storeroom at the other. The two first have been furnished with barred openings and gates, and the cell an I store room are being remodelled as a separate ward for women who are recovering : a new veranda at each side and a night latrine have been constructed. 8. The wards remodelled as described will in future stand thus, allowing about 50 superficial feet for each lunatic. Males. Superficial feet. Accommodates persons3 12. Some minor alterations and additions have been asked for, as a new latrine, servants' quarters, remodelling the Deputy Superintendent's house, and the roof of the cells, with a few other minor matters : these put out of hands, the Asylum will be in very good order. STATEMENT II. 13. The number of criminal lunatics admitted is the largest that has been yet shown, viz. eighteen; of these, ten males and two females were admitted from Berar, and six in all from the Central Provinces. Their offences were these : four Berar males were accused of murder, four of mischief, one of theft and one of house-trespass, with one female accused of murder, and one of theft. Of those who came from the Central Provinces, two males were accused of murder, one of cattle stealing, one of house-trespass, and one of petty theft ; one woman was accused of house-trespass. The three re-admissions have been before referred to, see paragraph 3. 14. Of the six discharged or transferred, two were sent to the Nagpur Jail, three for trial, and one was made over to his friends on expiry of sentence ; there remained 38 males and four females at the close of the year. STATEMENT III. 15. As at Jubbulpore, so it is here : the majority come from large centres ; Nagpur district furnished ten. STATEMENT IV. 16. Cultivators and laborers comprise more than one-third of those admit- ted. Those whose previous occupation was not known, with beggars, regarding whose former occupation nothing was known also, numbered exactly one-third ; and the remainder comprise fourteen different callings. STATEMENT VI. 17. It is probable that had my predecessor remained in office, he would have found it necessary to alter some of the types of insanity ; these we know change; acute cases settle down to chronic, and so forth. I have studied very carefully the cases of those remaining over from 1883 during the past year, and have found it necessary to make some changes ; these with the large number of admissions show totals differing in no great respect from those for Jubbulpore as regards some of the types. Dr. Rice explains that all his idiots were transferred from Nagpur some years ago, which accounts for the large number there and their absence here. The type moreover is not in every case so clearly defined as laid down in books, and the matter is not easily settled off- hand in some cases ; recoveries from acute mania are most numerous. STATEMENT VII. 18. The causes of insanity in many cases can only be guessed at by trans- mitting officers, and in the case of unknown wanderers must remain undiscov- ered. The statement is however prepared as faithfully as it is possible to do so. Ganja smokers are those best dealt with ; deprivation of the drug with the use of medicines known to be useful in such cases soon bring about improvement. 19. Epilepcics are unsatisfactory cases; of those in the Asylum two died, one whilst in what is termed "a fit" of the disease, the man was asphyxiated owing to the severity of the attack. Bromide of potassium in such cases is disappointing. STATEMENT VIII. 20. Many of these people never complain when ill, they carl themselves up in a blanket and refuse food, or they attempt to work without appearing to be aware that they are ill: a close watch over them is therefore necessary in
4 view to detect disease. The statement may be thus analysed. Fifty-eight in all came under treatment in hospital or one-third of the entire number that passed through the Asylum; and if we exclude two lepers, nine epileptics and three shown under old age and debility, total fourteen, who may be regarded as per- manent rather than occasional patients, the balance 44 does not seem to be a heavy annual total of Hospital patients; it shows, I think, that the general health, apart from mental disease, has been good. This may fairly be due to the favorable conditions under which they live, and under these come housing, cloth- ing, feeding, conditions of labour, site of Asylum and so forth. Every lunatic is weighed once a month in my presence, and his or her then condition recorded ; disease of an insidious nature must thus come to light. STATEMENT IX. Receipts from the treasury were in excess of those for the previous year owing to increased number of lunatics. The increase in receipts from paying patients is due to an increase in private patients : column 4 of the statement is thus made up :Annual Report on the Lunatic Asylum Jubbulpore for the year 1884. As usual this Report will take the form of comments on the Statements furnished at the end of the year. STATEMENT 1 shows that 133 Males 99/Females 34 remained at the beginning of the year. 12 Males 10/Females 2 were admitted since: 2 males were re-admitted, bringing the total population up to 147 Males 11/Females 36 Males 5 /Females 3 total population up to 147 Males 111/Females 36 ; of these 8 Males 5 /Females 3 were discharged cured, they have continued well ever since. 2 males were discharged otherwise; one, a European, was transferred to the Colaba Lunatic Asylum ; another to the Central Jail. 4 Males 2/Females 2 died, leaving 133 Males 102/Females 31 remaining in the asylum at the end of the year. Of the 8 individuals who were discharged cured, 7 were under treatment for " acute mania, " very much the most hopeful form of insanity ; the aver- age period each was under treatment was 8½ months. The eighth was admitted for dementia in 1878 and discharged after over six year's residence in the asylum, she was a criminal lunatic. Early in 1878 she was noticed to be strange in her manner: then it was said she grew violent, when her husband tied her up and took her to a neighbouring village with the intention of having the evil spirit with which they supposed she was possessed, knocked out of her ! It was said that she received very rough treatment; she escaped and fled towards her own village : on the way she came across a neighbour's child, took up a stick and killed her. She was a strong powerful woman, aged about 30 years : she was under my observation in the Havalat, and at the trial I deposed that during this time I could not discover any sign of insanity about her. In this opinion the Sessions Judge concurred, but the evidence left no doubt in his mind that she was insane at the time that she committed the act; accordingly he acquitted her on that ground, and recommended that she should be made over to her husband as soon as the official visitors considered that it could be done with safety. During the six years she was in the asylum she was very quiet and rational; but for a long time the visitors hesitated to discharge her until time had proved that the cure was permanent. This forms another illustration of the manner in which the gratification of the homicidal impulse often removes all signs of the insane condition which prompted it. Two harmless lunatics, idiots, were re-admitted from the Damoh district; they were discharged by the official visitors in 1883 as not being proper cases for treatment in a Lunatic Asylum under provisions of Chief Commissioner's Book Circular No. 31 of 1877 ; but the Deputy Commissioner managed to get them sent back again : as we were pressed for room at the time in consequence of two wards being re-roofed, they were with the consent of the official visitors, kept in the Main Dispensary. They were both in bad health when received back in the Asylum, suffering from chronic dysentery, in addition one had chronic rheumatic anthritis, which completely crippled him ; both were sent from Damoh in a cart. One died subsequently of his sickness, the other is slowly improving. They were perfectly harmless and never gave any trouble while in the Dispensary. One was there for nearly 4 months till he died ; the other was there for a year. The daily average number under treatment was 133.86 against 137.20 for the year preceding ; of these 100.75 were males and 33.11 were females. STATEMENT 2 treats of criminal lunatics. In 1884 there remained 28 Males 20/Females 8 ; 2 males were admitted during the year, being the lowest number admitted since 1879. One named Ladley was found to be insane while undergoing a term of 6 months' rigorous imprisonment in the Saugor Jail; on the expiry of his sentence he was found to be still insane and unfit for discharge, and the visitors recom- mended his transfer to the non-criminal list.
6 The other named Hirna was received from the Hoshangabad District, being incapable of making his defence to a charge of arson ; he continues insane; there is a history of hereditary predisposition. Of the 4 discharged or transferred, one was transferred to the non-criminal list, another was pronounced capable of making his defence to a charge of murder on 28th June last and sent to his district, Hoshangabad, to be tried, and has not yet been received back ; and two females were discharged by order of the Local Administration, who directed that they should be made over to their friends whenever the visitors considered it could be done with safety; the case of one Musst. Bandro has been described above ; the other was Musst. Khimia, whose case was described in last year's report. 25 Males 20 /Females 5 remained at the end of the year, the lowest number since 1879. STATEMENT 3 shows the districts from which lunatics were admitted ; of the eight districts, four, namely Seoni, Mandla, Narsinghpur and Nimar, sent none. STATEMENT 4 deals with the occupation of those admitted. The 14 admis- sions were divided between 6 different kinds of occupation : cultivators and beg- gars include 7, or half of the whole; naturally enough, as the great majority of the people are engaged in agricultural operations, and it may be inferred the " beggars " are beggars because their insanity renders them incapable of sup- porting themselves. The pensioned Apothecary was received from Harda in May, and as soon as the weather was mild enough for travelling and arrangements could be made he was transferred to the European Lunatic Asylum at Colaba. STATEMENT 5 deals with ages. Of the 14 admitted and re-admitted 11 were between 20 and 40, being the ages within which most cases of insanity arise, as explained in former reports. STATEMENT 6 treats of the types of insanity. Of the 14 admitted 6 Males 5/Females 1 suffered from acute mania, 1 male from chronic mania, 1 male from melancholia, 1 female from acute dementia, 3 males from chronic dementia and 2 from- idiotcy. The question of diagnosis of the various forms of insanity has been dis cussed in former reports, and no further reference to it need be made in this. The large number of idiots in the Jubbulpore Asylum has attracted notice. I offered some remarks in explanation of this in last year's report, adding that ''something also must be set down to the action of District officers" in ignoring the provisions of the Chief Commissioner's Book Circular above quoted. There does not appear to be much abatement of the practice : 2 harmless idiots and three cases of chronic dementia, a condition verging on idiotcy, also harmless, were sent in during the year from outlying districts, that is 5 out of a total admitted of 14. I have shown that such cases can be kept in a dispensary without inconveniencing anybody. STATEMENT 7 deals with the alleged causes of insanity. In former reports I have dealt with this question fully: no further remarks are called for here. Of the 14 admitted, a cause is assigned in three only, namely, one religious excite- ment; one grief and known hereditary predisposition ; and one an attack of con- tinued fever. Of the remaining 11 no attempt is made to assign the cause; and I have been unable to ascertain any. STATEMENT 8 deals with bodily ailments. The Asylum was very healthy during the year. Only 35 cases of sickness were treated against 41 for the year preceding. Of these 9 were for fever; 4 for bowel complaints; 3 for bronchial affections; 4 for eye diseases, with a number of single cases of various disease ; the whole, excepting the cases of dysentery, were of a mild type. No particular kind of sickness was prevalent. Four deaths occurred during the year, 2 males and 2 females. One male and one female died of chronic dysentery, the former was the man from Damoh, above referred to, already in a very exhausted state from the disease when
7 admitted : he lingered on for 3 months, and finally died worn out: the latter was a criminal lunatic, always a sufferer from the complaint,8 The two remaining wards are being similarly altered ; the work is now rapidly approaching completion, and will be fit for occupation by the 15th March, well before the hot weather sets in. The floors are concreted, covered with Murwara stone slabs, the joints of which are sealed with Portland cement. Notwithstanding the excessive monsoon rain-fall they remained quite dry, enab- ling us to dispense with raised berths, always so dangerous to epileptic patients, or to lunatics quarrelling, thus increasing the air space of the wards, and accom- modating a larger number of inmates : each ward will hold 5 more than before, being an increase of 20 altogether. The cost will be about Rs. 16,320. The Asylum was inspected regularly by the official visitors and by the Inspector General of Jails, who is ex-officio Inspector General of Lunatic Asylums, and by the Deputy Surgeon General, Saugor and Gwalior districts. They were always satisfied with the condition of the lunatics : with the food, clothing, conservancy and management of the institution generally. Much credit is due to Hospital Assistant Mohun Lal for the manner in which he performed the duties of Deputy Superintendent,STATEMENTS.

REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES. FOR THE YEAR 1885. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] NAGPUR: PRINTED AT THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE PRESS. 1886.
No. 4993 A./233 FROM F. C. ANDERSON, ESQ., C. S., OFFG. SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. To THE DEPUTY SURGEON-GENERAL, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 3rd November 1886. SIR, I am directed to acknowledge your letter No. 1674-542, dated 18th August last, submitting, with your remarks, the Reports of the Superintendents of the Nagpur and Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylums on the working of these insti- tutions during the year 1885. The Report of the Superintendent of the Jubbul- pore Asylum is dated the 12th February, that of the Superintendent of the Nagpur Asylum is not dated. The Reports, with your observations on them, are due in this office by the 1st May, but did not reach the Officiating Chief Commissioner in print until the 10th September, and I am to request their more punctual submission in future. Admissions, &c. 2. The number of admissions, discharges and deaths, &c., in each of the two Asylums (males and females) in the two years 1884 and 1885, are shewn in the table below :2 In the Jubbulpore Asylum the daily average strength was about the same in both years. In both Asylums there was accommodation enough and to spare for the patients under treatment throughout the year. Health of the inmates of the Asylum. 3. The daily average of sick patients during the past four years is given below :3 those of the Central Provinces,and it would appear from that table that much less success is met with here than in other parts of India in the treatment of insa- nity. The difference in favour of other Provinces is so remarkable that the Officiat- ing Chief Commissioner is disposed to think that there must be either some differ- ence of system or some error in the figures which vitiates the comparison. He observes that the Central Provinces percentage of " cured to admitted," as given in your table, is calculated on the " total population" (column 6 of Statement I.) of our Asylums. The heading in column 3 of the table is " total admitted". This for the Central Provinces means " total population". It may possibly not have the same meaning in the figures given other Provinces. Again, the words ''total cured" in column 4 of the table mean for the Central Provinces the total of cases wholly cured as distinguished from merely " improved" (see Statement I.) Pos- sibly cases "improved" are included under "cured' elsewhere. Differences in different Provinces must moreover depend to some extent also on the strict- ness observed in admitting cases to the Asylums. Dr. Rice, the Superintendent of the Jubbulpore Asylum, observes : 4 provinces which shows that differences in classification are as striking elsewhere as here, owing no doubt to differences in the views of the various types of insanity taken by the officers in charge of different Asylums. There appears to be little advantage in attempting to compare the percentage of cures of the various types of cases treated in the different provinces, as is done in Table III. in paragraph 13 of your Report, if dissimilarities in classifi- cation make it uncertain whether similar things are being compared or not. General management. 6. There has been a considerable increase of expenditure in the Nagpur Asylum, due, the Superintendent states, to the increase in the number of inmates. The ordinary expenditure on establishment, diet, &c., in the Jubbulpore Asylum is about the same as in the previous year. In the former institution there was a noticeable decrease in the sum received for paying patients, in the latter there was an increase. The Officiating Chief Commissioner observes that you have not compared the cost per head in the two institutions with that of the previous year, and with that in similar institutions in other provinces. I am to request that in future you will take the opportunity of examining the details of expenditure more closely. 7. In conclusion, I am to request that you will convey the Officiating Chief Commissioner's thanks to both Dr. Rice and Dr. Barter for their good services as Superintendents of the Jubbulpore and Nagpur Asylums. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, F. C. ANDERSON, Offg. Secretary.
No. 1674-542 L. A. FROM JAMES H. LOCH, ESQ., M. D., DEPUTY SURGEON-GENERAL, Central Provinces. To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. Dated Nagpur, the 18th August 1886. SIR, I have the honour to forward for submission to the Chief Commissioner the Annual Reports and Statements of the Nagpur and Jubbulpore Lunatic Asylums for the year 1885. 2. The improvements in the buildings and in the grounds of the Nagpur Asylum were continued and are described in the Superintendent's report. 3. The number of admissions and discharges at the Nagpur Asylum can- not be satisfactorily compared with those of previous years, for prior to 1884 the Asylum contained only lunatics from the Central Provinces, but in that year all the Asylum population of the Berars was transferred to it, and it now receives the lunatics from both Provinces. At Jubbulpore the number of admissions and discharges (including deaths) and the daily average strength are almost the same for the two years. 4. There was not any overcrowding in either the men's or women's wards in either of the Asylums. 5. At Nagpur the percentage cured was twice as high as it was in 1884, while at Jubbulpore it was rather lower, the ratio being considerably lower at Jubbulpore than at Nagpur. The following figures show, as did those submitted in the report for 1884, that the ratio of cured to admissions is very much smaller in the Central Pro- vinces than in other Provinces.

The number discharged as " improved" from the Nagpur Asylum was far above the average of previous years. 7. The death ratio was considerably higher in 1885 than in 1884, at both the Asylums. 8. There was only one re-admission at Nagpur and none at Jubbulpore. STATEMENT II. 9. Does not call for any special remarks. STATEMENT III. 10. Of the admissions nearly half were from the Head-quarters districts : this corresponds with the experience of most former years. STATEMENT IV. 11. Does not call for any remarks. STATEMENT V. 12. The age of the majority of the patients admitted is as usual between 20 and 40. STATEMENT VI. 13. Acute mania and acute dementia were the types of insanity under which by far the greater number of the lunatics admitted to the Nagpur Asy- lum were suffering, and nearly all those admitted to the Jubbulpore Asylum were entered as cases of acute mania. The following figures show that the differences in classification are as great in the Asylums of other Provinces as in those of the Central Provinces.

4 As Dr. Rice points out, acute mania will of necessity in consequence of the orders of Government for the admission of patients now in force, be the type of insanity exhibited by the majority of patients on their admission. The following figures give the percentage of recoveries from the more com- mon types of insanity in the Asylums of other Provinces as well as in those of the Central Provinces. TABLE III. Year.

The figures show that in Bengal, Bombay, the Punjab and Assam the per- centage of recoveries is very much larger in acute mania than in any other form of insanity. In Madras and the Central Provinces the percentage of re- coveries in acute dementia is also large. STATEMENT VII. 14. As in former years in the case of a large number of the patients admitted, the cause was unknown : of those in which it was known ganja was by far the most common cause in the case of the patients admitted to the Nagpur Asylum, but not of those sent to Jubbulpore. The following figures show the percentage of admissions and of recoveries under each of the most commonly alleged causes of insanity for the Central and other Provinces.
5 TABLE IV. Province. Year. Percentage of admissions and recoveries under6 STATEMENT VIII. 15. The daily average sick at both the Asylums is higher than it was in 1884, the ratio per cent to strength being7 At Nagpur the inmates of the asylum besides doing a large amount of most useful work in the way of levelling, road making, &c., for which no payment is made, raised Farm garden produce to the value of Rs. 1,070-6-5; at Jubbulpore the patients turned out manufactured articles to the value of Rs. 1,560. These figures show clearly that the Superintendents have, as in former years, realized and utilized the value of employment not only as a part of the treat- ment of their patients, but as a means of reducing the cost of the institutions under their charge. I have been much pleased with all that I have seen in their management. on my visits to the asylums. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, JAMES H. LOCH, M. D., Deputy Surgeon General, Central Provinces.
9 Report on the Nagpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1885. The manner in which the Asylum buildings had been remodelled in 1884, and the alterations still in progress, were described in the report for that year ; all were put out of hand in 1885. In addition two good separate cells for women built on old secure foundations, and a reconstructed latrine for women were put out of hand; whilst a dreary looking ward [Female No. 3 in previous year's report] was remodelled; these works were executed by the Public Works Department. 2. The lunatics have done much around the asylum to make it look trim and neat: this work is still in progress, and although there is still some untidy- ness about the environs, those only who knew the place formerly can estimate the nature of the work done ; whilst the appearance of the wards is altogether changed. The old male cells were simply dismantled and pulled to pieces by violent lunatics during the year. New brick and lime cells have been sanctioned and work has commenced ; the old foundations are good and will be built on ; keepers' quarters, remodelling the Deputy Superintendent's house, and a new male latrine are still required. STATEMENT No. I. 3. With the exception of the previous year when Berar lunatics were admitted in a body, no year since the asylum was opened showed so many admissions as 1885,10 7. Ten died ; one was an old woman who had been 12 months in the asy- lum. She was very violent, in bad health, and having got remittent fever, she rapidly sank. One admitted in 1876 died of phthisis. One admitted scorbutic from Berar and continued in bad health until he sank. One died from anæmia; his was a most aggravated case of secret vice, in public and private, by night and by day he practised it; nothing checked it but blisters on the organ, but to this treatment there was of course a limit, he died worn out. An idiot boy nine years in the asylum died from epilepsy; one from dysentery, who had been eleven years in the asylum. One died from peritonitis, one from pure debility after six years' residence. One was received moribund and died on the third day, and one died from dropsy after 11 years' residence. 8. The asylum was at no time overcrowded, and with the exception of loss of the male cells, the capacity continued as during the previous year. STATEMENTS NOS. 2, 3, 4 AND 5. 9. The first of these calls for no remarks, and all that can be said of State- ment No. 3 is that, as hitherto, Nagpur and Kamptee furnished a large number of the lunatics admitted. STATEMENT No. 6. 10. A large number of persons suffering from acute mania was admitted, some were very violent requiring separation in cells ; these they demolished ; they tore down the roof, pulled out the doors, dug up the floors, broke down the walls, necessitating rebuilding of the entire range. Clothing them was out of the question and feeding them was a laborious task. One man when let loose by the policemen who brought him to the asylum, went for the first man he met, a keeper, catching him on the stomach with his head and promptly upsetting him ; another was a very short time in a cell when he got through the roof on to the ridge and there danced about at the risk of his own life and to the terror of those below at whom he pelted tiles. The keepers and establishment had a busy time with them ; yet these men soon calmed down. A glance at this statement will show that Magistrates have been careful in sending to the asylum only those cases which demanded admission. 11. I have not found it necessary to alter the types of diseases of those in the asylum of previous years ; there was of course some difference in the demeanour and symptoms in regard to some, but on the whole not sufficient to render a change in type necessary. The remaining figures, recoveries, &c., in this statement have been already commented on. STATEMENT No. 7. 12. The causes of insanity have been commented on in previous reports. They are in most cases only guessed at and in 28 out of 47 admissions are absolutely unknown. STATEMENT No. 8. 13. The sick list was a full one and the death rate heavy. There was nothing in the season or in the asylum special to cause this,11 STATEMENT No. 9. 14. Receipts from the Treasury are in excess of those for 1884, owing to an increase in the number of lunatics. The population in 1884 was 174 and in 1885 it reached 200. The value of articles received from the Manufactory depart- ment is rather more, due to higher Public Works Department charges, which it is usual to exhibit here ; and the item Rs. 6,087-15-11 is thus made up:12 Annual Report on the Lunatic Asylum, Jubbulpore, for the year 1885. STATEMETN I.13 gone mad on at least three occasions, and was once chained up by his family for 8 months, and on other occasions for a fortnight at a time. I learnt from the Deputy Commissioner that his daughter also has gone mad. He made a most unprovoked attack on his wife, killing her with an axe: before the committing Magistrate he stated that when first he struck her with the axe he believed that he held only a stick ; but that on discovering his mistake he thought he might as well go on with the business ! It has been held by the Judges of a Presidency High Court that if a man accused of murder pleads insanity and proves that he thought he was only breaking a jar at the time, he should be acquitted of the murder on that plea. It might be worth arguing whether the heinousness of Ranjit's offence was lessened by his thinking he was using only a stick! In March last he was seized with a paroxysm of mania which passed off in about 10 days : there was a recurrence in July when, his case having been laid before the Chief Commissioner, his transfer to the Lunatic Asylum was ordered under Section 31 of Act V. of 1871. The second is a man named Ramdin Rahtore, transferred from Seoni. I have not yet received any history of his case. At present he is harmless, not given to interfering with anyone. STATEMENT III. Of the 15 cases admitted, 7, or nearly half, have come from Jubbulpore. It used to be thought that more lunatics came from the Jubbulpore district because the Lunatic Asylum being situated there afforded an easy way of disposing of persons supposed to be insane. Under recent rules no one is admitted until it is satisfactorily ascertained that his case is a fit and proper one for detention in the asylum : he is kept under the Civil Surgeon's observation in the Magistrate's Havalat until he is satisfied that the man is really insane, that it would be dangerous to the public to leave him at large, that his relatives are not capable of controlling him, and that residence in the asylum affords the best means of managing him, if not of restoring him to health. The case from Mhow is a woman suffering from mania, detained here under treatment at the request of the Central India Agency, there being no asylum within its limits: payment for her maintenance is made by the Cantonment Magistrate of Mhow. She is still insane, and at times violent. Excepting this woman, all the others are Hindus, due principally to the bulk of the population belonging to this community. They are too few for any speculations as to the greater liability to insanity in their case as compared with Mahomedans. The same remarks apply to Statement IV. STATEMENT V. Shows that nearly all the admissions occurred between 20 and 40 years of age: the period within which there are most survivors: and the time also when insanity is most apt to show itself if it is to happen at all. STATEMENT VI. Deals with the types of insanity : that of the old patients was explained in past reports.
14 Of the forms under which the new cases were admitted acute mania is the most common, 12 out of the whole 15 were admitted under that head. Besides being the form which insanity most commonly takes at its onset, it is also that under which practically according to recent orders of Government, sufferers become fit and proper cases for detention in a Lunatic Asylum because they are apt to be dangerous to themselves or to others, and afford the best prospect of a cure from suitable treatment. One is a case of melancholia in a criminal lunatic from Seoni whose his- tory has not yet been communicated. One a case of general paralysis of the insane, admitted at the beginning of the year : he died exhausted in August. One is an idiot received from the Seoni district, but steps are being taken to have ber taken charge of by her friends as she certainly is not a case for a Lunatic Asylum. STATEMENT VII. Of the causes assigned in this Statement, one each occurred from Ganja, opium, fever and epilepsy ; amongst the new admissions, 3 were said to have been caused by grief, in one of whom, the Deputy Commissioner and Medical Officer assure us, the immediate cause was disappointment in love ! One was unquestionably a religious monomaniac, he is a Sunnyassi resident in Jubbulpore. He recovered after 11 months' treatment. Another religious monomaniac amongst the old patients was also discharged cured this year. STATEMENT VIII.15 STATEMENT IX. Is the cash account and explains itself. We received Rs. 40 less from the Treasury than during the year before, and Rs. 77 more from paying patients : we received Rs. 68 worth of articles from the Asylum Manufacturing Depart- ment for asylum purposes less than in 1884. The Establishment cost Rs. 3 more, and we drew Rs. 35 more from the Treasury on account of diet, because the market rate of wheat was 2 seers per rupee, and of Dall ½ a seer dearer. Contingencies were Rs. 14 less, and Manufacturing Contingencies and petty repairs cost less by Rs. 48 and 17 respectively. As against the Rs. 7,670 received from the Treasury we paid back in cash Rs. 849, of which Rs. 316 were receipts from paying patients in reduction of the cost of their maintenance, and Rs. 533 on account of manufactured articles sold to the public. Our manufactures are of necessity limited and competition in the bazaar keen; we have no special market for our manufactured goods ; they are sold in the ordinary way to any person wanting them. Also, owing to the limited space round the asylum, we cannot embark in agricultural pursuits to any extent greater than an ordinary vegetable garden. STATEMENT XI.16 But if we take from this the sums repaid by paying patients and refunded into the Treasury on account of net proceeds of sales of articles manufactured by the lunatics we get Rs. 53-6-0 as the actual cost, and to Provincial Funds only Rs. 51-4-0.
