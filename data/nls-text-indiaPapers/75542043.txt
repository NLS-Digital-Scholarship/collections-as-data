Review by the Government of the North-West Frontier Province (Ministry of Transferred Departments) on the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, North- West Frontier Province for the year 1932-33. During a period of acute financial stringency, Govern- ment is not ashamed to say that it has found funds for the expansion of the activities of the Veterinary Department. Further not only has Government contributed towards ex- pansion, but local bodies have also sanctioned increased expenditure in this direction. One source of income, and therefore of possible expansion, alone has been neglected, namely contributions from private individuals. The difficulties which have beset the medical department both in this and in other provinces in attempting to collect fees from the well-to-do, make Government reluctant to attempt to introduce any discrimination between the rich and the poor in the matter of veterinary treatment. Nevertheless the fact remains that many persons who could well afford to pay for treatment of their animals, fail to do so and thereby take to themselves the benefits which should have been available for their poorer neighbours. The Veterinary Department can well congratulate itself on this expansion in its activities, since this may be directly traced to its own efforts to get into touch with the local people. The Superintendent has realised that in an area where the possibilities of veterinary science are as yet little appreciated, it is not enough for him and his staff to sit in their hospitals waiting for patients. The number of villages visited has increased from 3,075 in the previous year to 4,296 in the year under report, and the number of animals treated in villages, including castrations, from 75,317 to 102,279. At the same time the number of rural
2 dispensaries has been increased from 8 to 22, and the number of animals treated in these and in Veterinary Hospitals has risen from 89,553 to 127,737. Fifty-seven touring dispensaries are now established in out-of the-way parts of the Province, and in these 30,937 animals have been treated for diseases and 19,078 castrations have been performed. Cattle breeding operations continue to receive the attention of the Department, and there is no doubt that the system of subsidy bulls, introduced into the Province by Mr. S. M. A. Shah and continued under the guidance of Mr. S. I. A. Shah, is producing a marked improvement in the local cattle. Here again nothing is of greater value than ocular demonstration, and the Superintendent is assured of Government's support in any attention which he desires to pay to the staging of shows. Lectures, too, are required on the best methods of securing and maintain- ing an improved breed. The Veterinary Department, it is true, does not entirely neglect this form of propaganda, but it might well make more use of the opportunities offered by the Publicity and Co-operative Departments. In this connection it should hardly be necessary to draw attention to the advantages to all ranks of the Department of being able to speak Pashtu. Government is doubtful of the wisdom of increasing its commitments in the matter of horse-breeding. The horse is not used at all as a plough- or draught-animal for agricultural purposes, and with the expansion of the programme of road-building is being used less and less for purposes of transport. Apart from racing the use of the horse even for sport is on the decrease, and Government considers that the limited money allotted to transferred subjects is better spent on the plough- and draught- animals of the agriculturist many than on the racing acti- vities of the few. Government, therefore, while not curtailing its activities in this direction, is at the same time not prepared to extend them except in response to a clearly voiced popular demand. Government appreciates the keenness with which Mr. S. I. A. Shah has carried out the duties of Superin- tendent, and joins with him in thanking Mr. H. K. Penrose, Khan Sahib Sheikh Abdur Rahman, and Rai Bahadur Lala
3 Jagan Nath, Secretaries of District Boards, for their close co-operation with him. By order of the Government, North-West Frontier Province (Ministry of Transferred Departments). ABDUL QAIYUM, A.

Work performed on tour3 amongst the Bovines of the Province while the animals effected with Anthrax died cent. per cent. in Kohat District. Rinder- pest was chiefly responsible for the fatalities amongst the Cattle of Peshawar, Hazara and Dera Ismail Khan Districts. 5. Pathological specimens4 8. Surra- No case was reported during the year under report. 9. Anthrax and other contagious diseases5 13. Foot and mouth disease6 apppeared in Darsamand and Khakar Khail villages the source of infection being hides brought from the adjoining inde- pendent territories of Tirah. There were four cases of Anthrax amongst bovines and 326 amongst other animals and all proved fatal. Immediate steps were taken and the out breaks were brought under control in time. 18-A. Other contagious diseases7 tute, Kasauli, for microscopic examination, out of which ten proved positive. This is the most fatal and dangerous disease both for human beings and animals, of which the control is entrusted to the Civil Veterinary Department. In this sense the Department is rendering a valuable help to humanity. 22. Distemper8 28. Strangles- Seventy cases were reported and treated with cent. per cent. success. 29. Pyæmia9 is becoming more popular and it is leaving no stone unturned to make its services available to the public. More hospitals means more cases treated and better facilities awarded to the public in securing the Veterinary aid. Besides the above these hospitals are centres to control contagious diseases and to further the supervision of the improvement in Cattle Breeding and other Veterinary work in this Province. During the year under report 127,737 animals received treatment at these institutions against 89,553 during the previous year. Besides the abovementioned dispensaries 57 Touring Veterinary Dispensaries have been established in the rural areas for the benefits of the Zamindars of the Province, which are attended once a week by the nearest Veterinary Assistant or Assistant Surgeon or Inspector on fixed days. These dispensaries have relieved the poor zamindars from the necessity of taking their sick animals to the Veterinary hospitals far from their villages. The detail of the work performed in touring dispensaries of the Province is as follows :10 PART II11 in that direction is assured. This work will however require time and money to mature. The public has started to appre- ciate the work and is slowly getting over its apathy and prejudices. 34. A12 The number of donkey stallions on the 1st April 1932 was 17. One was purchased from Hissar during the current year and one was auctioned, leaving the balance of 17 at the end of the year under report. 38. Service of stallions13 40 Numerical strength14 Deputy Superintendent and one senior Veterinary Assist- ant Surgeon were deputed to the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore, to undergo Refresher course during the year under report. 42. Expenditure15 work was carried out due to paucity of funds and trained local staff during the year under report. The Veterinary work is gaining confidence to the extent that even in a place so remote as Swat State the Wali has decided to continue the Veterinary Hospital at Saidu. Although the work all round has greatly increased yet the office establishment has remained the same as in 1928 with the result that the ministerial staff of the office is heavily over worked and needs extra hands. The Superintendent wishes to express his thanks to all the District officers and Political Agents for the help given to him and his staff in carrying out their duties. Thanks are also due to Mr. Penrose Secretary, District Board Peshawar, Khan Sahib Sheikh Abdur Rahman, Hon- orary Secretary, District Board, Kohat, and Rai Bahadur Lala Jaggan Nath, Secretary, District Board, Dera Ismail Khan for their keen interest and close co-operation with the Department.

Review on the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province, for the year 1933-34. The activities of the Civil Veterinary Department may be divided into three main categories :2 lectures and demonstrations in connection with the pre- vention of diseases and the encouragement of cattle breed- ing were carried out by the Superintendent and his staff. These fairs have the additional advantage of assuring the collection of large crowds from the rural areas and thus affording an opportunity for the Department of Public Health to vary the programme by means of lectures on village uplift. In this connection, Government are most grateful to Captain E. Cobb, Assistant Commissioner, Mardan, for the energy and initiative he has shown in organizing cattle shows in the Mardan Sub-Division, a feature that has proved most popular and has done much to stimulate the keeness of stock-owners. Ten students from this Province are under training in the Veterinary Department and Government hope to be in a position to make a much needed increase in the cadre of the Department in the near future. The thanks of Government are due to Mr. S. I. A. Shah, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department for the keen and energetic way in which he has carried on the work of the Department during the year unde report and for the very considerable progress he has been able to make in all departments inspite of the difficulties due to financial stringency and lack of staff under which he has been labouring.

GS&PO-NWFPANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE FOR THE YEAR 1933-34. PART I2 Surra Treatment Centres and Mallein test performed in the North-West Frontier Province were supervised by him. As usual Deputy Commissioners, Vice-Chairmen, Secre- taries and members of the local bodies and other leading Khans and Maliks of different parts of the Province were interviewed and matters relating to the Veterinary require- ments of their respective ilaqas were discussed. The Superintendent attended the Horse and Cattle Shows held at Haripur, Hazara and Dera Ismail Khan. He also arranged Rural Uplift shows in co-operation with the Assistant Commissioner, Mardan at Charbagh and Takhtibai. He arranged Veterinary exhibitions at these places, judged the animals, distributed the prizes and pre- pared posters containing useful advice and instructions on various contagious diseases, cattle breeding and other Veterinary matters for distribution among the zamindars. Lectures were also delivered by the subordinate staff under the direction of the Superintendent on those occasions. The stock-owners were impressed by the demonstration, great interest was evinced by the large number of specta- tators who attended. The Superintendent arranged the purchase of stud bulls from Dhanni tract in the Punjab. He also selected two donkey stallions at the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, to promote mule breeding operations in the North- West Frontier Province. (b) The Deputy Superintendent assisted the Super- intendent in carrying out inspection duties. PART II3 In the absence of any legislation to control the move- ment of animals, the Department's only means of combat- ing contagious diseases is to resort to Hygienic inocula- tion and vaccination measures. In this work, however, the co-operation of Patwaris, Lambardars, Maliks and Khans is necessary to bring about the effective control of disease in a village, and in the absence of this, the work remains only half done. Certain progress has been made in this respect and village officials are beginning to realise their responsibility in this direction through propaganda by the Veterinary Department, but pressure from Assistant Commissioners and Revenue Officials would greatly help matters. Reserves of sera and vaccine were maintained at suit- able centres to meet emergencies. The demand of anti- Rinderpest Serum was so great that the Budget allotment was found insufficient. Inoculation and vaccination have won the confidence of the rural masses and they readily pro- duce their cattle for inoculation in the event of disease and it is pleasing to note that they have overcome their pre- judices and do not try to conceal outbreaks as was the case in the past. 5. Pathological specimens4 District during the year under report, but none proved positive for Glanders. 8. Surra5 already known to Government. The Department does all it can by the "Serum alone" method to combat such fatal diseases as Rinderpest. Other methods such as Serum Simultaneous or Goat Virus cannot at present be tried in this Province. 12. Preventive inoculations against Rinderpest6 a considerable number of cattle are protected. The Depart- ment, however, finds great difficulty in obtaining early in- formation, which is so essential for successfully dealing with this disease. 15. Preventive inoculation against Hæmorrhagic Septiæmia7 it accounted for 60 seizures and 55 deaths. Strict prophy- lactic measures were adopted and thus the disease was brought under control. The-source of infection was sus- pected to be hides, etc., from Tirah. 20. Expenditure of sera and vaccine8 rabies exists. Members of the Department view this risk and thus render a most valuable service to humanity. From this year the Pasteir Institute of India, Kasauli charges a fee of Rs. 10 for examining the brain of a sus- pected animal, which the poorer zamindars of this Province are unable to pay. In order to avoid a serious outbreak of Hydrophobia amongst human beings, the Superinten- dent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province has recommended to the Local Government that these charges should be met by the local bodies concerned. It is understood that Rabies is communicable and fatal to human beings and animals alike and that no known cure for it has yet been discovered. 23. Distemper9 28. Pyæmia10 medicines. Twenty-eight thousand and seventy-seven cast- rations were performed in these dispensaries against 23,174 during the preceding year. The steady improvement in the attendance at Veteri- nary Hospitals, shows the popularity of the work done amongst the masses and is being well maintained. Progress so much depends on the efficiency of the individual that no effort is being spared by the Superintendent to keep the staff upto date in their professional knowledge. The scheme of outlying dispensaries is being carried on successfully. The Department is making every effort with the small staff at its disposal to bring Veterinary treat- ment within easy reach of the zamindar. The net work of these institutions was expanded and the detail of work performed in them is as follows :11 PART III12 and it is hoped to start sheep breeding operations in the Kaghan Valley of the Hazara District during the next year. SECTION III13 sums in cash prizes to compensate them for their trouble. Cattle fairs and exhibitions do a great deal to remove the prejudices which exist in the minds of zamindars and at the same time assure a mass-gathering which in turn offer a good opportunity for propaganda work. 40.

DEPARTMENT NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE FOR THE YEAR 1934-35 Printed and published by the Manager, Government Stationery and Printing, North-West Frontier Province, Peshawar 1936
Review on the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province for the year 1934-35. Although its activities have been somewhat circum- scribed owing to lack of funds the Veterinary Department has made considerable progress during the year under review. It is satisfactory to observe that mortality among animals, is on the whole, on the decrease, especially among bovines. Against 27,128 seizures and 6,363 deaths during last year, the corresponding figures for the year under report are 11,943 seizures and 2,043 deaths. Among equines, however, there is an increase both in seizures and in deaths, as compared with the last year. While the figures for 1933-34 are 14 cases and 2 deaths those of the year under report are 108 cases and 21 deaths. Glanders and tetanus have been the chief diseases among equines and foot and mouth disease, rinderpest and hæmorrhagic septicæmia among bovines. The Department has taken active steps to treat dis- eases in rural areas, through the agency of Veterinary Hosptials and Touring Dispensaries. The latter bring veterinary aid direct to villages, and have proved of immense educative value in rural areas. As a result of this and of the small increase it has been possible to make in the number of village dispensaries, scientific methods of treatment are no longer looked upon with apathy and villagers are keen to avail themselves of veterinary treat- ment. Not a little of the decrease in mortality is atributable to preventive inoculation. Sixteen thousand, eight hundred and fifty-two cattle were inoculated for rinderpest by the Serum alone method" during the year against 26,183 last year, and although there were 76 outbreaks of the
2 disease, these were rapidly brought under control by prompt measures on the part of the Department. Similarly, preventive measures were taken against hæmorrhagic septicaemia and other diseases. Horse breading operations, however, owing largely to the increase in mechanical transport, have not expanded and the number of stud horses dropped from 16 to 14. As regards bulls there were altogether 223 Dhanni, Montgomery and buffalo bulls at stud during the year as against 234 of the previous year and 15,159 cows were covered as compared with 14,796 last year. The Mont- gomery like the Dhanni breed seems to be gaining in popularity and as a consequence the milk strain among village cattle has improved considerably. A sheep-breeding scheme has also been introduced by the Department. To improve the strain of sheep in the Kaghan Valley, 20 Hissar dale rams and 15 ewes were imported from the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, and were distributed amongst breeders in the valley. It is hoped that this scheme will have far reaching results. During the year under report four Cattle Fairs and Horse Shows were held. These attracted a large number of people from rural areas and, as was the case last year, advantage was taken of this by the Veterinary, Public Health and Educational Departments to give demonstrations and lectures. During the year, two students from this Province qualified as L. V. P. and two were admitted to the Veterinary College, Lahore. The total strength of 10 of the last year has thus remained unchanged. Government are grateful to Mr. A. D. F. Dundas, I. C. S., Deputy Commissioner, Peshawar, Major G. L. Mallam, Bar-at-Law, I. A., Deputy Commissioner, Kohat, and Captain Iskandar Mirza, Deputy Commissioner, Hazara, for the interest they have taken in the activities of the Department and especially for their initiative in organising cattle-shows in their respective districts. But for their sympathy and active support, the fairs would not have been the success they have proved.
3 In conclusion, the thanks of Government are due to Mr. S. M. A. Shah, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department for the keen and energetic way in which he has discharged his duties during the year under report.

ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, FOR THE YEAR 1934-35. PART I2 The Superintendent personally arranged and super- vised the Horse Shows and Cattle Fairs held at Mardan, Haripur and Kohat. He attended the meeting of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research in September 1934 at Simla and visited Bombay and Government Cattle Farm, Hissar to select and purchase the horse and donkey stallions respectively for the Horse and Mule breeding operations in the Province. He arrang- ed the purchase of stud bulls from Punjab Province. Mr. Shah also interviewed several Maliks and zamindars of different districts and agencies and advised them on various points of veterinary interest. The Superintendent in addition toured the Kaghan Valley, surveyed personally the possibilities of sheep breeding and successfully intro- duced the Merino Rams, a long standing requirement of the valley, into suitable centres of the locality. (b) The Deputy Superintendent assisted the Superin- tendent in checking the work of the Subordinate Staff in Bannu District. PART II3 result. To save a zamindar from falling into debt and to give him continuous occupation on his land it is essential that his livestock should be protected against all types of diseases. For this adequate staff is essential, who can at the same time attend to cattle breeding and so enable zamindars to rear their own cattle. 5. Veterinary Laboratory In addition to his own duties the Office Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Raja Sadarud Din Ahmad held the charge of the Laboratory throughout the year. He examined 102 pathological specimens against 101 of the last year. Under the directions of the Superintendent, he preserved some interesting pathological, bacteriological and helmenthological specimens in the Museum of the Laboratory. Antirabic treatment was carried out in the Laboratory under the supervision of Mr. S. I. A. Shah. Laboratory work constitutes a very important branch of the Department and the establishment of a Provincial Veterinary Laboratory with a whole time Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge and a Laboratory Assistant is a pressing necessity. SECTION I-A4 communicable to man and always fatal to the latter, it is essential that in the interest of humanity three Veterinary Posts should be started at Landikotal, Miranshah and Razmak. It would be the duty of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of these institutions to examine all horses entering British territory and to refuse entry to those found to be suffering from contagious disease. 8. Surra3 The introduction of this disease in hilly tracts is always followed by severe mortality amongst the local underfed cattle owing to their low resistance to disease and to the lack in the absence of legislation of effective measures to limit the spread of the disease from village to village. 12. Preventive inoculations against Rinderpest6 though not very fatal is important because animals become lame and have ulcers in their mouths with the result that they become terribly emaciated, incapacitated for work, abort, milk dries off, etc., etc., and can not put on condition for months after recovery. For a zamindar healthy animals alone are an asset and ailing cattle are a liability. 14. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia7 serious in that it generally attacks young and valuable cattle and thus gives a set back to the zamindar and also to cattle breeding in the Province. Vaccine is comparative- ly cheaper than Serum and gives more effective and more lasting immunity. 17.Black Quarter3 animals during the year under report were Foot and Mouth Disease, Sheep Pox, Mange, Distemper, Fowl Cholera, Ranikhet Disease, Fowl Diphtheria and Rabies. There were 1,906 seizures and 321 deaths against 5,261 cases and 1,406 deaths in the preceding year. 22. Rabies9 27. Ranikhet Disease- Outbreaks of Ranikhet Disease were reported from Hazara, Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan Districts and the disease was responsible for 46 seizures and 29 deaths. Several medicines like Pot. Permagnas, Iodine and Pot. Chloras were tried but none proved specific for this disease. Experiments in this respect will be continued in the coming year. 28. Fowl Diphtheria10 Province, but during the year under report, in the face of acute financial stringency, the Superintendent manag- ed to open three more rural dispensaries (two in Bannu District at Kakki and Titterkhel and the third at Nahaqi in Peshawar District). The total number of rural dis- pensaries was thus raised to 23 at the close of the year. At these institutions 153,411 animals received treatment against 127,737 in the past year, which demonstrates the increasing popularity of the Department. Not only this, but these institutions are centres for the control of contagious diseases the cattle and horse breeding operations in the ilaqa and of veterinary activities in general, including propaganda. 32. Field veterinary dispensary11 33. Buildings- It is unfortunate that, due to financial stringency, no construction of buildings for rural dispensaries could be undertaken, nor any alterations or additions made to the buildings of existing hospitals by local bodies. PART III12 Frontier Province. Their breeding, however, is in the hands of poor people to whom numbers count for more than quality. The Department is doing all it can to improve the donkey strain. SECTION II13 where breeding has been going on for a considerable length of time on scientific lines, under the supervision of special officers of the Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab. 38. Buffalo breeding14 PART IV15 One post of Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was sanction- ed from 1st March, 1935. This small staff of 35 men is insufficient to cope with the progress of veterinary activities. The question of creation of more posts of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and new posts of Stock Assistants is under consideration. Two clerks were added to the sanctioned cadre of Ministerial Establishment from 1st November, 1934. 42. Veterinary education16 43. Expenditure17 leave reservists cadre. This makes a total of 92 subordi- nate veterinarians or a total deficit of 56 men. If this Province be. compared with the adjoining pro- vince of the Punjab, with its 294 dispensaries has 370 mer on the cadre of the Subordinate Veterinary Service. Our requirements for the 43 dispensaries in this Province are 54 veterinarians. Our present strength is 35 veterinarians and to carry out efficiently the work at present in hand 19 more veterinarians are immediately needed. For further development on the lines recommended by the Royal Com- mission on Agriculture in India, a further 38 veterinarians would be needed for whom adequate financial provision should be made in the Budget of this Department in the coming five years. The Royal Commission on Agriculture in India, vide paragraph 251 of their report suggested that the Chief Veterinary Officer in a Province should be styled the Director, Veterinary Services. This suggestion has already been given effect to by the appointment of the Director of Agriculture and Allied Departments. Under the Director, Veterinary Services, there should be Deputy Directors. The Commission considered that it would be sufficient if each province is divided into two or three circles only each of which would be in the charge of a Deputy Director who would be a member of the Indian Veterinary Service so long as any number of this remains in service or of the new Superior Provincial Veterinary Service. The appropriate scale of pay for these services would be the existing scale of the Indian Veterinary Service. Consider- ing the size of the Province, the creation of 1 post of Deputy Director would suffice. The Commission further recommended the appoint- ment of one District Veterinary Officer for each district who would-be a member of the Provincial Veterinary Service. Class II. According to this recommendation 5 posts of District Veterinary Officer are needed, one new post might be created every year for the next five years. The total cost of clerical establishment in the Punjab is Rs. 52,000 for 294 hospitals against Rs. 4,000 for 43 hospitals in this Province. On the Punjab basis the cost of the clerical establishment in this Province works out at
18 Rs. 7,600 which is immediately and urgently required for the smooth and efficient discharge of clerical duties.

Review by Government of the North-West Frontier Province (Ministry of Transferred Departments) on the Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department for the year 1935-36. Now that animal husbandry is so much in prominence, it is satisfactory to observe that this important branch of the Veterinary Department has not been neglected. In effect its history starts from 1927 with the appointment of a whole- time Superintendent for this Province. In that year there were only 20 stud bulls, which were in the keeping of local Khans and of which no scientific record was kept. From then the number of bulls increased, and during the year under report there were 212 bulls which effected 13,852 coverings. At first Government bulls were unpopular with the people. The latter felt that such fine looking animals would not stand up to local conditions and only Government could afford the cost of their maintenance. After several experiments, it was realised that the key of the problem lay in making the bulls the property of the ordinary zamindar, and this is the under- lying principle of the existing subsidy scheme. Its success is evident in the cattle shows that are held yearly throughout the Province, where are to be seen in large numbers the off- springs of Government stud bulls. These animals are of a fine sturdy build, capable of ploughing two or three times the area of land tilled by the local breed. Owing to the success of the subsidy scheme, the Depart- ment decided to extend it with the object of raising the standard of the local buffalo. The number of buffaloes in the Peshawar Vale is large and they provide the milk supply for the local population ; yet lactation per buffalo is very low, being only 1,000 lbs. as compared with 5,000 lbs. in the case of the Nili breed. To start a breeding farm would be prohibitively ex- pensive, but fortunately there is in the Military Dairy Farm an available supply of first class buffaloes. The Veterinary Department has recently arranged to purchase from them their buffalo calves, which will be given out to local zamindars on the same terms as Government stud bulls. In this way it is expected that after a few years the milk supply will be in- creased and villages provided with a valuable source of income. Another venture which is at present engaging the atten- tion of the Department concerns the poultry of the Province.
2 There is not a village without its poultry, yet the local breed makes poor table birds and the size of their eggs is notoriously small. A poultry section has been started at Tarnab Farm and eggs are sold to the neighbouring villages for hatching. A general improvement in the standard of poultry in the villages would be a great boon to the small zamindar and assist him in eking out a living for his family when conditions are bad. It is hoped, therefore, that it will be possible by degrees to extend the scheme to cover the whole Province. During the year under report the health of the cattle of the Province has been satisfactory and the figures show a decrease of 459 in the number of deaths from disease. The drop was most marked in the case of rinderpest, and was largely due to the introduction, for the first time, of goat tissue virus vaccination, which has now taken the place of the method known as &quot;Serum Alone&quot;. The vaccine is pre- pared in the laboratory of the Veterinary Department and during the year 16,120 cattle were vaccinated with eminently satisfactory results. The Department has continued to expand and during the year the number of rural and touring dispensaries rose to 53 and. 96, an increase of 30 and 34 The achievements which have been described in the preceding paragraphs are largely the work of one man. Except for a short period when he was relieved by his brother, Mr. Shah has been Superintendent of the North-West Frontier Province Veterinary Department since 1927, and Government wish to thank him and his staff for the wonderful progress they have made during so short a period, and hope that success will continue to crown their efforts in the future.

He visited Dhanni tract of the Punjab and purchased stud- bulls for the Province. He surveyed various tracts of the Province to find out possibilities of the improvement of goat, sheep and poultry. He worked on the Executive Committee of the S. P. C. A., Peshawar Branch and also acted as Honorary Veterinary Surgeon to the Society. He delivered lectures on various subjects on different occasions. He prepared and published thirty departmental leaflets on different veterinary subjects and also supplied notes for broadcasting. He personally supervised the Goat Tissue Virus pre- paration at the Veterinary Laboratory, Peshawar. He interviewed Deputy Commissioners, Political Agents and Members of the District Boards of different districts and agencies who were convinced of the necessity of extension of veterinary aid in every nook and corner of the Province. (b) Deputy Superintendent.3 in the gazetted rank. The creation of these posts is very necessary as emphasized in the last year's report. 3. Subordinate establishment4 Peshawar City and was equiped with all modern scientific apparatuses. Under the close supervision of Mr. Shah, the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge Laboratory, examined 107 pathological specimens against 102 of the last year and some helminth parasites were preserved in the museum of the laboratory. Fourteen thousand and eight hundred doses of goat tissue virus were prepared in the laboratory for immunizing the cattle against rinderpest in this Province. (a) EQUINE DISEASES. 6. Mortality- There were 116 cases and 33 deaths as compared with 108 cases and 21 deaths in the preceding year. 7. Glanders5 11. Strangles6 deaths as compared with 33 cases and 30 deaths in the preceding year. 17. Anthrax7 23. Fowl Cholera8 27. Preventive inoculation against Hæmorrhagic Septicemia9 year. This increase in number of animals treated on tour is mainly due to the fact that the people are realizing and utilizing the services of the Department to their utmost. The up-to-date scientific method of castration with the Burdizzo. Castrator has become very popular among the rural population and they now condemn their antiquated method of castrating their animals by stones. The modern method is absolutely bloodless and far less troublesome. 33. Criminal poisoning10 touring dispensaries at work, where 51,985 animals were treated against 37,005 in the past year. The extension of such centres in remote places has brought the veterinary aid within easy reach of zamindars. 36. Buildings- All the rural dispensaries in the Province are lying in the hired buildings, most of which are quite unsuitable for such institutions. Government has been addressed to sanction grant-in-aid to the District Boards for the construc- tion of buildings for these dispensaries. During the year under report no additions or alterations were made in the existing buildings of the veterinary hospitals. CHAPTER IIIII SECSTION I12 breeds were considered and it was decided, after thorough consideration, that the well-known Dhanni breed of the North Punjab was the most suitable for the purpose. Later on the milk consumption in urban areas was investigated and it was found that the local cows were very poor milkers and thus they could not meet the demand of milk in the cities and towns. Stud bulls of Montgomery and Nili were, therefore, introduced in the Province to develope the dairy cattle. Recently Dajal breed is also given a scientific trial in Dera Ismail Khan District and the results achieved will be carefully observed. 39. Dhanni cattle-breeding13 Much improvement has been effected by these bulls in the milk strain of local cows. It is under consideration to locate more stud bulls at Mardan, Nowshera, Haripur, Abbottabad and Dera Ismail Khan. 41. Dajal cattle-breeding14 the Peshawar Valley ; thus ameliorating to a certain extent the financial difficulties of the cultivator. SECTION II15 46. Sheep-breeding16 of Jumnapari strain of g oats, which are well-known for their milk yield, were introduced. More bucks will be purchased and located in these areas. The local goats in Kaghan Valley possess hair which resembles very much with the moihair and there seems to be possibilities for the development of moihair industry. The Department is in correspondence with the Union of South Africa in this connexion. SECTION IV17 the eggs will be issued to the zamindars for breeding pur- poses at a nominal cost. It is expected that this scheme will improve the local indigenous breeds of poultry within a few years. SECTION V18 SECTION VI19 the whole lot. But the construction of foot-bath costing only a nominal amount has materially helped to stop the appearance of such a terrible disease. This demonstration convinced many zamindars to construct such foot-baths in. their own villages. Some useful speeches on veterinary and allied subjects were also broadcast from the Peshawar Broadcasting Station. CHAPTER IV20 52. Blood manure experiment21 given in previous chapters. In a nut-shell they are as follows :22 As emphasized in the previous year's report the creation of the post of Deputy Director Veterinary Services is a pressing necessity. Proposal for the conversion of the post of the Superintendent into Deputy Director Veterinary Services has been submitted to Government which involves a nominal expenditure and it is hoped, will meet the approval of Government. The clerical staff continued to work zealously and energetically under the supervision of M. Ghulam Sarwar Khan, Head Clerk, whose name is specially mentioned for his good work. As it will appear from the report the Department has increased its activities by almost hundred per cent. This has naturally enhanced the responsibilities of the Head Clerk, who controls the office. In view of the above Government has been approached to enhance his grade and pay compatible with his position and responsi- bilities. On the recommendation of the Superintendent, nine zamindars were granted Kursi Nashin tickets in recognition of their services rendered to this Department. With a few exceptions the work of the technical staff was satisfactory. The Superintendent commends the work done by his Personal Assistant Raja Sadar-ud-Din Ahmad, and the following officials :23 Deputy Commissioner, Bannu, who in spite of their manifold duties, have taken so much interest in making the veterinary organization of their district effective and production of good results to the stock breeding industry of the Province.

Review by Government of the North-West Frontier Province on the Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, for the year 1936-37. The Veterinary Department continues to grow and its expansion since 1927 has been remarkable. In that year there were only 18 dispensaries and no touring dispensaries, whereas to-day the total number of both is over 200, the increase during the year under report being 19 and 43 respectively. In addition many new activities have been introduced, including among others, sheep, goat, and poultry breeding. It is true that in 1927 the Department was too small to meet the needs of the people, but to-day the position has changed and there must be few areas which are not regularly visited during the year. The question arises whether the time has not come to call a halt and consolidate the ground already won. As it is, there is an insufficiency of trained men to look after all the existing dispensaries and a large number are managed by compounders. The present dispensary buildings are unsatisfactory, the majority being dilapidated and in urgent need of repairs. There is also the question of expense. The cost of this Department has risen rapidly and at a time when calls on the Govern- ment purse are becoming increasingly heavy. The Department has a good record to show for the year. The number of cases treated at veterinary hospitals and dispensaries was 313,982 against 223,663 in the pre- ceding year and the number of villages visited rose from 6,243 to 9,681. These efforts did not go unrewarded and the year under report was a healthy one. The number of deaths from equine and bovine diseases dropped to 5 and 1,224 as compared with 33 and 1,293 during the previous year. The decline is partly due to the successful use of goat tissue virus vaccination in combating rinderpest. During the year 56,266 head of cattle were vaccinated com- pared with 16,120 in the previous year, resulting in a drop in the death rate from 55 per cent. to 38 per cent. within the year.
2 Hæmorrhagic septicæmia accounted for the largest number of deaths, namely 822. This figure is slightly higher than that for the year before, despite the fact that over 25, 000 animals were vaccinated against this disease. During the year 88 new Dhanni stud-bulls were pur- chased under the subsidy scheme and 50 Lohani bulls and 10 cows from His Excellency the Viceroy's Fund. The latter, which are of a sturdy build, were bought with the purpose of improving the standard of cattle in the Kurram Valley. In addition 19 Sindhi bulls, a type noted for its milk yield, were distributed in the districts of Hazara and Kohat. One feature of special significance is the larger number of castrations performed during the year, namely 77,487. If this Province is to improve the standard of its cattle, it is essential that the poor quality zamindari bull should be put out of action. Last year's record of castrations was made possible by the appointment of livestock assistants. These men, who are unqualified and on a low grade of pay, represent an effort on the part of the Department to provide veterinary facilities in rural areas at a minimum cost to Government. Their function is to supplement the work of the regular qualified establishment and, after a short course of training at headquarters, they are sent out into- rural areas not covered by dispensaries; to supervise stud- bulls, give treatment in simple cases and perform minor operations. Their engagement has proved a success, and since their employment, not only has the number of castra- tions gone up, but the average number of coverings per stud-bull has nearly doubled. On the whole the year has been a satisfactory one, and Government wish to express its appreciation of the work performed by Khan Sahib S. M. A. Shah, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department and members of his Depart- ment. J. R. L. BRADSHAW, Secretary to Government, North-West Frontier Province, Development Departments. GS&PDeptt-NWFPANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, FOR THE YEAR 1936-37. PART I2 He personally arranged many small cattle exhibitions on his visits to veterinary hospitals and awarded encourag- ing prizes to zamindars rearing subsidy-produce. On these occasions he delivered lectures in simple language on eradication of contagious diseases, animal treatment, and management of livestock. He attended all the Horse Shows and Cattle Fairs held in the Province and supervised the arrangements made for public demonstrations chiefly in respect of scientific veterinary aid and stock farming. He attended the political Jirga of leading Khans in Kurram Agency and convinced the audience of the activi- ties of his Department. He surveyed the Lohani Tract in Baluchistan, interviewed the Political Agent, Loraloi, and purchased Lohani stud bulls for the Kurram Valley. He also visited Dhanni Tract of the North-Punjab and pur- chased stud bulls for the Province. He supervised the livestock and poultry at the Agricultural Farm, Tarnab and gave useful instructions with regard to their management at the farm. He also inspected the Frontier Constabulary chargers and rendered his free advice to that Department. He also acted as a member of the Provincial Rural Uplift Committee where the beneficial activities of his Department, in respect of rural reconstruction, were appre- ciated by the members. He worked on the Executive Committee of the S. P. C. A., Peshawar Branch and also acted as Honorary Veterinary Surgeon to the Society. On tours he inspected animals used for transport in hills as well in plans under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Glanders and Farcy Acts. He attended the meeting of Advisory Board of Imperial Council of Agricultural Research in July, 1936 at Simla and in January 1937 at Delhi. At Simla he also attended the meeting of the Cattle-Breeding Sub-Committee and the Veterinary Officers Adhoc Sub-Committee. He interviewed the Principal. Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore, in connection with the Frontier nominees. The Superintendent surveyed the Province to know the possibilities of wool and goat hair export from the produc- ing tracts. He keenly supervised the bee-keeping opera- tion and the art of cleaning, grading and packing of wool
3 and goat hair which were put to scientific experiments with the idea to educate zamindars in this industry. He toured over Province to find out all possible means of furthering the activities of his Department and spared no pains in public welfare. He managed a vigorous pro- paganda for donations in response to the appeals of Their Excellencies the Viceroy and the Governor of the North- West Frontier Province for livestock improvement. 2. District veterinary offices4 is an absolute necessity which always stands in the way of expansion of the Department. The present staff is adequately active and competent in convincing the people with their work. 4. Veterinary Laboratory, Peshawar5 (b) Bovine diseases. Mortality.6 129 in the last year. Sporadic cases of Black Quarter occurred in all the districts. The outspread was checked by quick preventive measures. 850 animals were vaccinat- ed against this disease as compared to 719 cattle vaccinated in the last year. (c) Other animals diseases. Out of 5,066 cases in sheep, goats, and camels 1,039 heads died of different contagious diseases against 6,578 seizures and 387 deaths in the preceding year. Increase in mortality was chiefly due to Anthrax and Contagious Pleuropneumonia in sheep and goats. Anthrax cases occurred in Kohat District where a flock of 180 sheep and goats was inoculated with anti-Anthrax Serum. As shown in Table II these animals fell prey to many serious epidemics during the year. Deaths were also due to Pox and Scab diseases. Foot and Mouth disease was responsible for 2,782 seizures and 20 deaths. There were 321 seizures and 100 deaths in dogs. Twenty-nine cases were suspected for Rabies against 48 of the last year. Six brain specimens were despatched for Laboratory Examination out of which 2 proved positive for Rabies. Twenty-seven dogs were vaccinated against Rabies during the year. 286 dogs suffered of Distemper with 67 deaths as compared to 376 cases and 247 deaths in the preceding year. There were 4 cases of dogs' Tick Fever in Peshawar, Kohat and Dera Ismail Khan Districts which died of the disease. Two dogs were treated for Mange. (d) Poultry diseases. Fowl Cholera and Ranikhet diseases appeared in Kurram Agency, Dera Ismail Khan and Bannu Districts. There were 27 seizures and 22 deaths of Fowl Cholera against 129 cases and 81 deaths in the preceding year. Out of 61 Ranikhet cases 37 birds died of this affection as com- pared to 44 seizures and 31 deaths during the last year. SECTION (B)7 SECTION (C)8 44, 136 animals were castrated against 30,825 of the last year. Increase in attendance shows that people are now better acquainted with this profession and take real interest in treatment of their animals. 2. Touring dispensaries9 The fall in strength of the stallions is due to the wide spread mechanical transport which has affected the horse- breeding operations to a great extent. In years gone by it was a paying business with the breeders to keep well bred horses but now it is not an economic industry. 2. Mule and donkey-breeding10 account of their unsatisfactory condition and 88 new bulls were entertained making up the balance to 228 bulls by the end of the year under report. They covered 14,932 cows against 13,619 cows during the last year. Most of the progeny carried the characters of Dhanni breed and they were kept in satisfactory bodily condition. This proves the popularity of Dhanni breed and an increased familiarity of its characteristics amongst zamindars. In certain tracts of the Province which are fertile enough to provide their main- tenance the Dhanni breed of cattle is rapidly increasing and castration of scrub bulls is being pushed ahead. The cattle-breeding scheme has ameliorated the farmer's hard lot to a considerable extent. 2. Lohani cattle-breeding11 5. Montgomery cattle-breeding12 to the advantages of approved sheep-breeding both for mutton and superior wool. Proposals have been made to provide funds for sheep-breeding operations in this Province. The Department is maintaining Pusht-i-Koh and Hissar Dale rams and ewes on scheme in Kaghan Valley, Kohat, Bannu and Hazara Districts respectively. At the begin- ning of the year there were 26 Hissar Dale rams 5 in Kohat District, 9 in Bannu District and 12 in Kaghan Valley of the Hazara District out of which one died in Kohat and another in Bannu leaving a balance of. 24 rams at the end of the year under report. Nineteen Hissar Dale ewes were also at work on scheme in Kaghan Valley. Seven Pusht-i-Koh rams bred at the Agricultural Farm, Tarnab were distributed in Hazara District in August 1936. Vigorous demonstrations were given to breeders on the quantity and quality of wool produced from well-bred sheep. Results achieved so far are hopeful. 2. Goat-breeding13 SECTION (E)14 students studying at the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore and 14 nominees were admitted during the year under report. Two students qualified as L. V. P. who have since been suitably fixed up in the Department, two left the College leaving 23 Government stipendiaries in the College ; 14 in the 1st year, 4 in the 2nd year, 4 in the 3rd year and 1 in the 4th year at the close of the year under report. One student qualified from the Bihar Veterinary College, Patna and has been absorbed in the Department. Two more students of this Province were sent to the Bengal Veterinary College, Calcutta during the year. Arrangements were made to train all the subordinate staff in the technique of Goat Tissue Virus Vaccination against Rinderpest (Cattle Plague) so that every Veterinarian may be able to control the disease when it occurs in his Illaqa. One Veterinary Assistant Surgeon went on leave to undergo a course of advanced training at the Ontario University. One Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was deputed to undergo post graduate training at the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar Kuman, U. P., who has since come back after completing the course. One Veterinary Assistant Surgeon came back after completing his training at the Imperial Institute of Dairying, Bangalore. A Veterinary Stock Assistant was deputed to the New Egerton Mills, Dhariwal, for training in the art of cleansing, grading and packing of wool. Another Stock Assistant was sent to Kulu to receive train ing in bee-keeping. A Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was sent to Jullunder for training in flaying in hides and skins. 3. Prevention of Cruelty to Animals15 The dispensary remained well-equipped with necessary requirements. The present accommodation is quite inade- quate. The necessity for an up-to-date, hospital building has been impressed upon the Society. 1,650 cases were treated in the S. P. C. A. Dispensary, Peshawar Canton- ment as out-door patients compared to 38 cases of the last year. The ailments were mostly of surgical nature. 917 animals against 96 of the preceding year were treated as in-door at the Civil Veterinary Hospital, Peshawar City which is an infirmary under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. 4. Blood manure preparation16 being developed from a mutton view point established a further record in liveweight. Ram No. 14 weighed 3 maunds, 6 seers and 4 chattanks against 3 maunds the record of the previous year. 6. General remarks17 revision of his grade, proposal for which has been submitted to Government. The Superintendent, is glad to see a gratifying response from public to his personal zeal in expanding the Department alround. They realize the yeoman services of this Department and some are very sincere to assist the staff in the field work. On the recommendation of the Superintendent the following persons were granted Kursi Nashin tickets :i TABLE II Statement showing the number of seizure and deaths from contagious diseases and othes causes among animals during the year 1936-37 Circle Equines Cattle Glanders Surra Dourine Anthrax Other diseases Other causes Total Rinderpest H.

Review by the Government of the North-West Frontier Province of the Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department for the year 1937-38. The year 1937-38 has been one of continued progress in all spheres of veterinary work. The response in the Frontier Province to His Excellency the Viceroy's Appeal for the improvement of livestock has enabled the Government to expand their cattle breeding operations while the figures of attendance at Veterinary Hospitals and Touring Dispensaries reveal an increased activity in every branch of work and are a testimony to the greater confidence and appreciation which the Department has earned among the people. Although the Department owns a few stud bulls of other breeds, notably in the Kurram, where the zamindars prefer the Sindhi bull, the Dhanni breed from the North-Punjab has proved the most successful in this Province. The number of bulls at stud has increased from 317 to 408, of which 322 belong to the Dhanni breed. Coverings by the bulls of the Department have risen from 17,082 to 25,615, while castra- tions, which represent the most important element of every cattle-breeding scheme, have reached the remarkable figure of 91,586. The Department has convinced zamindars through propaganda and by example that it is to their advantage to have their cows covered by the stud bulls and to produce their scrub calves for castration, and the results which the introduction of the improved strain has achieved within the last ten years is apparent at every cattle show and fair. One new Veterinary Hospital and 8 new Touring Dis- pensaries have been opened, bringing the number of these institutions to 73 and 147. The number of animals treated rose from 313,982 to 374,568. The high incidence of epidemic disease among both horses and cattle during the year has thrown a burden on the veterinary staff. The Superintendent has pointed out more than once that the present staff consisting of 17 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, 26 Veterinary Assistants, 6 Stock Assistants and 54 Com- pounders, are insufficient to man the 220 Hospitals and Dis- pensaries maintained by the Department. Government are
2 fully aware of the need for an increase of staff, but have hitherto found it difficult to provide funds or to obtain fully trained men : they hope that with the return of the 28 Frontier students, who are now studying at the Punjab and Patna Veterinary Colleges, it will be possible to expand the cadre. In conclusion Government wish to thank Khan Sahib S. M. A. Shah and the other officers of the Veterinary Depart- ment for their work during the year. The expansion of the Department's activities during recent years is chiefly due to the keenness and organising ability of the present Superin- tendent. Secretary to Government, North-West Frontier Province, Development Departments.
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, FOR THE YEAR 1937-38 PART I2 He visited the Dhanni tract in North-Punjab for the selection of suitable stud-bulls for this Province, attended the Cattle Conference held at Simla in May 1937 and the meeting of Advisory Board of Imperial Council of Agricultural Research in November 1937 and February 1938. He attended the All India Cattle Show, Delhi, held in February 1938, where a few bulls and their progeny and other exhibits from this Province were shown. 2. District Veterinary Offices3 expenses of sending for the vaccine from outside. The Official Incharge examined 148 diseased specimens and prepared 60,800 doses of Goat Tissue Virus Vaccine. Necessary Sera and Vaccines were stored in the Laboratory and supplied to veterinary hospitals on indents. G. T. V. was issued in large quantities to immunize cattle against Rinderpest. PART II.4 zamindars. Goat Tissue Virus Vaccination camps were started throughout the Province which moved from village to village and protected 48,718 bovines against Rinder- pest. 2. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.5 A large number of sheep and goats were attacked with Foot and Mouth Disease in Kohat District and also some fell victim to Anthrax and Scab. 420 sheep and goats were inoculated with Anti-anthrax-serum in the same District against 180 inoculations performed last year. Mortality was also due to other causes as shown in Table II. Fifty-nine camels suffered from Mange in Dera Ismail Khan District which were treated successfully. There were 202 deaths out of 600 seizures in dogs against 321 cases with 100 deaths last year. Rabies was responsible for 57 cases against 29 of last year. In most cases it was the dumb form. Brains of 13 suspected cases were despatched for laboratory examination, out of which 7 proved positive for Rabies. This year 16 dogs were vaccinated against Rabies. Distemper was responsible for 86 deaths among 430 cases as compared to 67 deaths in 286 cases of the previous year. Tick fever attacked 4 dogs and killed 3 of them. Laboratory examination of their blood generally did not show the common Protozoon which indicates that there is some very rare variety of Piroplasm which is also very obstinate to treatment. Further observations are being made on the disease. Fifteen dogs were treated for Mange. (d) Poultry Diseases6 SECTION (C)-NON-CONTAGIOUS DISEASES TREATED ON TOUR-TABLE IV. The Staff toured for 10,057 days and visited 11,104 villages as compared to 8,801 days spent on tour and 9,681 villages visited in the preceding year. They performed extensive tours to meet the increased rural de- mands and to run the various schemes of the Department. They treated 88,414 patients for non-contagious diseases, attended 27,207 contagious cases, castrated 38,380 animals in the field as against the respective number of 70,801, 12,100, and 33,351 animals in the previous year. There is a marked increase in work all round which shows great exertion on the part of the staff and real interest taken by the people in veterinary matters. It was brought home to zamindars that the scientific treatment of animals is more paying and convenient to them than adopting the old crude system of treatment in villages. Castration of local calves at the younger age was pushed ahead by means of the Burdizzo castrator which has become popular in the field. All the prophylactic in- oculations were fully explained. Frequent touring in rural areas secured ready control over epidemics. SECTION (D)-CRIMINAL POISONING. Fifteen cases of criminal poisoning were reported most- ly from Hazara District, against 2 cases in the last year. Their specimens were despatched to the Chemical. Examiner for confirmation and the accused were dealt with accordingly. PART III7 centres for the control of outbreaks and demonstration of departmental schemes. The services of these institutes were fully utilized by the rural population of the Province. Though a large number of Veterinary Dispensaries have been opened in each District, there is still a keen demand for more particularly in the remote areas of the Province. The number of patient treated in hospitals was 2,78,719, number of cases supplied with medicines for treatment at home was 27,335 and the number of animals castrated was 53,206, against 2,35,729 aminals treated in hospitals, 20,130 cases supplied with medicine and 44,136 castrations performed in the previous year. There is a marked rise in work at hospitals this year which indicates the increased popularity of these institutions. 2. Touring Dispensaries8 gear and service remained satisfactory during the year and their exercise, grass, grain etc., were properly looked after. They covered 314 mares. 2. Mule and Donkey Breeding9 cows and stop breeding from local deteriorated bulls. Castration of scrub calves at a young age was strictly advised as weeding out of the undesirable sires is most essential to produce a pure strain. Then regular care and proper feeding would improve the live- tock a lot. In addition to district shows several village shows were held during the year when subsidy bulls and their progeny were collected and prizes awarded. These shows provide the necessary fillip to cattle-breeding operations and constitute a very effective form of demonstration to bring home to zamindars the remunerative economic value of scientific cattle breeding. On these occasions the oppor- tunity was taken to undertake every form of propaganda in the form of exhibits, leaflets, specimens, etc., to make the zamindars conversant with all the activities of the Veteri- nary Department. In general there was a marked change from non-descript cattle-breeding to remunerative scientific stock farming which is an encouraging sign of improve- ment. At the end of last year there were 817 bulls at stud in the Province. Thirty-seven were cast and 128 more were entertained on the scheme during the year under report which increased the number to 408 stud bulls in the Province. Out of the newly located bulls 75 were purchased from His Excellency the Viceroy's Appeal Fund for livestock improvement. 1. Dhanni Cattle Breeding10 breeders took a keen interest in rearing the produc properly. 2. Lohani Cattle Breeding11 remained in satisfactory condition and covered 1,467 buffaloes against 1,397 performed in the previous year. SECTION (C) DAIRYING. Dairy Farms at Islamia College, Peshawar, and at the Police Training School, Hangu, worked under the super- vision of this Department. They were useful demonstra- tion centres for Dairy-farming. Necessary advice regard- ing general management, protection from epidemics, pro- duction of wholesome milk and pure ghee etc., was given and results watched carefully. Services of the Nili buffalo bulls, Montgomery, Dajal and Sindhi bulls located for the purpose at some Veterinary Hospitals and in villages were keenly utilized by breeders in transmitting their high milk strain to local cows. There is plenty of scope for dairy development in the Province. SECTION (D)12 in Kohat and 1 in Kurram, leaving 9 on the scheme in the Province. Arrangements were made to import 6 Angora Goats from the U. S. A. for the development of Mohair in hills. Their work and physique were watched closely. SECTION (E)13 and 2 students in the Bengal Veterinary College, Calcutta. One left the College and one qualified as L. V P. from Lahore. During the year 7 more men were sent to the Punjab Veterinary College increasing the total number of stipendiary students to 28. 3.

The Civil Veterinary Department continues to grow and its expansion since 1927 has been remarkable. In the latter year there were only 18 dispensaries there are now 71 dis- pensaries and 160 touring dispensaries. These figures are in themselves satisfactory, but it is more important that each dispensary should become a real live centre than for an increase in mere numbers to be shown year after year. The number of outbreaks of contagious disease among cattle rose from 83 in the previous year to 221, and the con- sequent mortality from 3,207 to 4,602. There was a heavy increase in the incidence of Haemorrhagic Septicaemia and Rinderpest, and the Superintendent reports that inspite of the extensive use of Goat Virus Vaccine the Department have been unable to control the latter disease. The lack of a Provincial Laboratory is partly to blame for this. Govern- ment intend to build a Laboratory as soon as funds permit. The number of cases treated at dispensaries and on tour has risen from 421,675 to 452,926, and the number of castrations from 91,686 to 102,892. The total number of inoculations and vaccinations carried out increased from 70,159 to 97,667. The number of stud bulls maintained under the Cattle Breeding Scheme of the Department rose from 395 to 407 and the number of coverings from 25,615 to 32,030. The value of the Department's stud bulls is shown year by year in the improved classes which appear at district cattle shows. In conclusion, Government wish to express their appre- ciation of the work performed by the officers of the Depart- ment, and in particular by the Superintendent, Khan Sahib S. M. Shah, who has since left this Province and returned to the Punjab. Mr. Shah has been in charge of the Civil Veterinary Department from 1927 to 1932 and again from 1935 to 1939, and its remarkable expansion has been largely due to his energy and administrative ability. H. P. TOLLINTON, Secretary to Government, North-West Frontier Province, Development Departments.
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, FOR THE YEAR 1938-39. PART I2 respectively as also the Second All India Cattle Show Delhi held in February 1939 where he acted as a Judge for three breeds of the cattle. He worked on the Executive Committee of the S. P. C. A. Peshawar Branch, also acted as Honorary Veterinary Surgeon to the Society and inspected the animals under Prevention of Cruelty to animals and Glanders and Farcy Acts. He remained a Member of the Provincial Rural Uplift Committee. 2. District Veterinary Offices3 PART II 4 outbreaks were satisfactorily controlled with Hæmor- rhagic Septicæmia Vaccine. In certain villages pre- ventive Inoculation of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia Vaccine were also performed with very satisfactory results. The total number of animals inoculated with Hæmor- rhagic Septicæmia Vaccine were 27,927 as compared with 20,894 of last year. 3. Foot and Mouth Disease.5 effectively checked by the use of Antiseptic foot baths. Six hundred and ten cases of Anthrax amongst sheep and goats with 565 deaths were recorded in Kohat District. Sheep-pox resulted in 120 deaths out of 341 seizures. The Veterinary Investigation Officer, North- West Frontier Province, is conducting experiments on this disease with a view to finding a preventive vaccine for this scourage. Goat Scab had a toll of 80 animals out of 477 seizures. No case of contagious disease was recorded mongst camels. Four hundred and sixty-five cases of distemper occurred amongst dogs, of which 353 recovered with proper care and treatment. Ninety-eight cases of Rabies were recorded and eight suspected brains were sent for Laboratory Examination to Pasteur Research Institute, Kasauli ; of which seven were reported positive for Negri Bodies. Fifty-three Antirabic Vacci- nations were performed compared with 16 during the last year. Two cases of Canine Typhus were reporte from Kohat, both of which proved fatal. (d) Poultry diseases6 extending Veterinary aid to the remotest corners of the Province and bringing home to the Zamindars the immense advantages of the various schemes introduced by the Department. They treated 98,790 patients for non-contagious diseases and 19,708 for contagious diseases as compared with 88,414 and 27,207 patients respectively in the preceding year. The number of animals castrated increased from 38,380 in the preceding year to 40,970 during the year under report. The Department's efforts to educate the people in the matter of proper care and management of their animals are showing results. The Zamindars now show keener interest in the activities of the Department and try to avail themselves of the opportunities offered. Constant convassing on the part of the Department through its subordinates and otherwise, is, however, necessary, because majority of the population still holds some deep rooted old ideas which impede the progress in Animal Husbandry work and which it is necessary to uproot. SECTION (D)7 demand for more dispensaries is louder and it is felt that there are several areas, mostly in remote localities, where the opening of dispensaries would meet a long felt necessity of the population. The number of patientdssity oreated the hospitals and dispensaries rose from 278,219 in the preceding year to 302,614 during the year under report. Thirty-one thousand eight hundred and fourteen animals were supplied with medicines for use at home compared with 27,335 last year. The number of animals castrated also rose from 53,206 to 61,922. These figures speak for increase in the work and popularity of the Depart- ment. 2. Touring Dispensaries8 coverings numbered 969 compared with 1,131 in the preceding year. There is a great demand for these stallions in most of the hill tracts where the only means of transport are pack animals, but owing to shortage the existing stallions are continually being transferred from place to place. SECTION (B) CATTLE BREEDING9 In the beginning of the year there were 322 Dhanni bulls on the Scheme 39 were cast and 60 new bulls were entertained bringing the number to 343 by the end of the year. The number of Dhanni cows on Scheme rose from 9 to 16 during the year under report. The progress in the number of coverings by these bulls was maintained. It is satisfactory to note that there has been a steady increase in the number of coverings as will be seen from the figures of the past three years :10 5. Montgomery Cattle Breeding11 leaving the balance of 10 rams and 43 ewes at the end of the year. There were 6 Pushti Koh Rams in Hazara District and 11 Pushti Koh Rams in Peshawar District. The total number of their coverings is 420. Out of these 6 rams died leaving the balance of 11 at the end of the year. There were 8 Merino rams at the beginning of the year, all located in Hazara District. The Merino rams which previously had been given to Agricultural Depart- ment12 ment were delivered. Special exhibition wards for making comparison and showing contrast between the progeny of the scrub bulls, and that of the approved stud bulls, were organised at these Shows. Subsidy bulls and their produce formed a major part of the entries and the numbers of competitors far exceeded the figures of previous year. On the whole the Livestock condition was good and the scheme bred stock was outstanding. The Shows were graced by the visit of His Excellency the Governor, North- West Frontier Province, the Hon ble Premier with the other Hon'ble Ministers, the Secretary to Government, North-West Frontier Province, Development Depart- ments, and other high Civil and Military Officers. Strict precautions were taken to avoid the import of conta- gious diseases into the fair premises, and where possible arrangements were made to pass all cattle through a foot bath to protect them against Foot and Mouth disease. Five buffalo bulls with 5 cows and 5 heifers were taken from this Province for Exhibition at the 2nd All India Cattle Show, Delhi, in February 1939. PART V13 The Superintendent expresses his thanks to all the Deputy Commissioners, Political Agents and Local Bodies for their valuable help extended to the Depart- ment during the year under review. He also wishes to record his appreciation of the work done by the Subordinate Staff both Professional and Clerical. S. M. SARWAR, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province.

Mr. S. M. Sarwar, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, took over charge on the 23rd September, 1939, from the Deputy Superintendent Ch. Ghulam Qadir who had been officiating since the transfer of Mr. Shah at the beginning of the year. The number of hospitals remained the same as in previous years. The total number is 73 for the six districts of the Province. Three outlying dispensaries were, how- ever, added to the existing 160, but the difficulty of provid- ing the staff for these still exists. The system whereby Veterinary Assistants close their hospitals and go on tour for 2 days a week to the outlying dispensaries is not satisfactory and the Government hope that it will be possible to rectify this shortcoming. They also approve of the Superintendent's policy of raising the standard of the existing hospitals rather than increasing their number. The figures for animals treated in hospitals throughout the Province rose by 5 per cent., and the number of castrations by 8 per cent. over last year's figures. The most serious disease was an outbreak of Hæmorrhagic Septicaemia confined chiefly to Mardan District where it resulted in 1,278 deaths and led to the vaccination of some 50,000 animals. Cattle Breeding continued to make satisfactory progress, the success of the Lohani breed with their com- bination of milch and draught qualities and particular suitability for the greater part of this Province is very encouraging. Other animal husbandry activities were not so successful but during the year under report these were mostly in charge of the Agricultural Department, Their
2 transfer to the Veterinary Department has since been ordered and Government hope to see an improvement in this section next year. In conclusion Government wish to thank Mr. S. M. Sarwar for his report and look forward to seeing an all round improvement as a result of his many schemes of reorganisation. W. C. LEEPER, Secretary to Government; North-West Frontier Province, Development Departments.
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, FOR THE YEAR 1939-40. PART I2 large number of one day cattle shows in all important centres of the Province with a view to study intimately the tendencies and susceptibilities of the zamindars of the Province and to check the results of the depart- mental activities. Small cash prizes were distributed to the exhibitors at these village shows to encourage them in livestock development work. The disease control work also received my special attention and I attended a number of contagious diseases outbreaks and carried out preventive inoculations. The work of the Veterinary Investigation Officer was studied in detail and arrangements were made to provide him with every possible facility to render service to the Province. His system of work was completely overhauled and placed on proper scientific footing. I helped him in every possible way such as direction, dia- gnosis and field research. I inspected the Frontier Constabulary chargers and all dairy centres during my tours and offered professional advice whenever it was considered necessary. Dhanni Cattle Breeding tract was visited for selec- tion and purchase of stud animals, as during my inspec- tion tours in the Province I felt that the standard of stud animals needed strict selection and supervision. Hariana tract was also visited on my return from Delhi after attending the All India Cattle Show. I paid visits to the Imperial Cattle Breeding Farm, Karnal and Government Cattle Farm, Hissar. At the latter place donkey stallions were selected and purchased for stud purposes in this Province. In connection with Buffalo Breeding work Bahadur- nagar Grantee Farm District Montgomery, was visited for purchase of pedigree buffalo bulls of Ravi breed for use as stud animals in the Bannu, Mardan and Peshawar Districts. I attended the meeting of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research on the 29th November3 Considerable attention was paid to the prevention of cruelty to animals particularly to S. P. C. A., Dera Ismail Khan. Every opportunity was availed of on tours to per- form operations on diseased animals brought to the hos- pitals to teach and encourage the professional members of the Department. Every possible assistance was rendered to the staff in professional matters. 2. District Veterinary Offices 4 arrangements for the proper discharge of the technical work. Arrangements were made to set up proper well- equipped Laboratory in a rented building and the Pro- vincial Government was requested to provide funds for building a proper Laboratory. I personally took over charge of the Laboratory and discharged all the duties with the assistance of Office Veterinaey Assistant Surgeon. As a result of the study of the past progress of the Goat Tissue Virus Vaccination work in the Province it was found that due to faulty technique of preparation and inoculation of this product no lasting benefit and immunity had been conferred on the inoculated animals. Numerous instances were available where outbreaks of Rinderpest had occurred subsequent to repeated inocula- tions with Goat Tissue Virus Vaccine. The manufacture of this product was taken up on proper scientific lines, the staff was thoroughly trained in the use of this pro- duct and detailed instructions were printed both in English and Vernacular for the guidance of Subordinate Staff. 111,500 doses of Goat Tissue Virus vaccine were actually prepared but 1,66,500 doses were issued to the Subordinate Staff for use in the field as against 61,500 and 59,800 doses prepared and supplied respectively in the previous year. 101 Pathological Specimens were examined during the year under report as against 86 of the last year. The purchase and issue of biological products was found very unsatisfactory. The whole procedure was overhauled in a manner that these products were sup- plied promptly without leaving room for wastage. 5. Investigation5 test. An outbreak of Bovine Surra was investigated. Carried out experiments with sheep pox and goat pox vaccines manufactured by Imperial Veterinary Research Institute Mukteswar. Camphor and various other indigenous drugs were tried in the treatment of Doyle's disease with negative results. PART II6 in the presence of nature infection. The rise in the number of seizures and deaths during the year under report is most probably due to keenness of the staff in proper recording of the diseases incidence. Most of the outbreaks were controlled by the Goat Tissue Virus Vac- cination alone method. In some areas particularly the hilly tracts Anti-Rinderpest Serum was administered to animals reacting severely to the vaccine. The Veterinary Investigation Officer has been directed to supply accurate data by conducting small scale field experiments, regarding the susceptibility of different types and breeds of cattle and buffaloes in different areas of the Province. Attempt is also being made to determine the minimum dose of Anti-Rinder- pest Serum which would control the severity of the Goat Tissue Virus Vaccination reaction in buffaloes. It is intended, after studying all aspects of the disease and methods of control,to evolve a system of routine inocula- tions of animals in the Province and those imported from outside which would reduce the incidence of the disease to the very minimum possible. The reduction in milk yield subsequent to Goat Tissue Virus Vaccine inoculations is likely to prove the greatest hinderance in achieving the above object. 2. Haemorrhagic Septicaemia.7 outbreaks is almost double reflects on the prompt measures adopted by the Department in control of outbreaks. In all 47,078 were vaccinated with H. S. Vaccine as compared with 27,929 of last year. 3. Foot and Mouth Disease.8 respectively which speaks for the prompt and effective veterinary aid rendered to the sick animals. Antiseptic Foot Baths proved very useful in the control of this disease and wherever possible they were made use of by the zamindars according to the instructions of the Department. Anthrax was responsible for 150 deaths amongst sheep and goats out of 473 seizures in Hazara, Mardan, Kohat and Dera Ismail Khan Districts. The outbreaks were successfully controlled with serum in- oculation. Anthrax Spore Vaccine was used as a preven- tive measure. This however, is still in the experimental stage and the results are being watched. Pox amongst sheep, goat resulted in 42 deaths out of 100 seizures. It is, however, necessary to record that these figures do not represent the true state of affairs. Sheep pox occurs extensively throughout the Province and the low figures are probably due to the zamindars ignoring this disease which is of common occurrence. The Veterinary Investigation Officer, North- West Frontier Province, continued further experiments on this disease with a view to evolving a protective vaccine. There was a marked fall of seizures from Goat and Sheep Scab during the year under report. Only 62 seizures were recorded against 478 seizures in the pre- vious year. Distemper.9 Province and took a very heavy toll in all areas parti- cularly, Hazara, Peshawar and Bannu Districts. The zamindars are not very much satisfied with the help that the Department can render them in view of the fact that the treatment of the most important disease, viz., Ranikhet is not yet known. With the appoint- ment of the Veterinary Inspector for poultry diseases it is hoped that more accurate data with regard to in- cidences, economical importance and treatment of various poultry diseases will be made available. The necessity of sending smears and other pathological tis- sues to the Labaratory is being impressed upon the Subordinate Staff. SECTION (B)10 castrated as against 40,970 of the last year and 38,380 of the preceding year. Attempts are being made that all non-descript bulls in the breeding areas are unsexed be- fore their covering age. This however, not only requires energy on the part of the staff but also constant con- vassing and education of the zamindars who have a special dislike to castration before the age of 6 years when the animal is fully developed and has done suffi- cient damage to breeding operations of the Department. SECTION (D)11 2. Outlying Dispensaries12 2. Mule and Donkey Breeding13 areas has been hampered for want of stud bulls which the Province is obliged to buy from the Dhanni Tract of the Punjab. The zamindars being ignorant of the scientific principles of breeding began to express views that the Department should encourage them by purchasing the progeny of the stud bulls for stud purposes. For obvious reasons this step could not be taken but it was felt that local breeding of pure Dhanni animals should be encouraged. With this object in view Dhanni cows were purchased from the Dhanni tract of the Punjab and given to the zamindars on subsidy scheme on the understanding that the progeny of these cows out of the approved stud bulls shall be purchased for stud purposes. To keep effective control over this system of breeding branding of all stud animals and their progeny has been decided upon. In previous years also a few pure Dhanni cows had been purchased and given on subsidy scheme but these were not looked after properly by the zamindars. It was either due to the fact that the purpose of this scheme was not properly explained to the darindas of these cows and they considered i more advantagious to take all the milk of the already low yielding cow and starve the progeny. All the circumstances were fully explained to the darindas old or new and the results of the experiment are keenly awaited. The low milk yield of the female of this breed is a very important factor in the economics of the Local Cattle Breeding and attempts are being made by introducing stud bulls of good milching cows, to improve the milk yield of the progeny to some extent. Purely draught breeds under Indian Market conditions can never prove economical to the zamindars. In the beginning of the year there were 343 bulls on subsidy scheme, 73 were cast and 77 more entertain- ed during the year under report, bringing the total to 347 at the end of the year. The number of coverings rose from 26,726 to 26,781.29. More Dhanni cows were entertained on scheme, three were cast and hence there was an increase of 26 cows during the year under report. These cows have been entertained on subsidy scheme as an experimental measure as explained above. Suitable male progeny of these cows will be used for stud
14 purposes and the female progeny for further breeding. The results of coverings were ascer ained as usual and produce certificates issued to the owners. 2. Lohani Cattle Breeding 15 5. Montgomery Cattle Breeding16 SECTION (D) SHEEP AND GOATS BREEDING. 1. Sheep Breeding17 2. Goat Breeding18 hatched or not. The Hazara District Board agreed to open 3 such breeding stations. In due course other District Boards will be asked to take up this work. SECTION (E)19 which appeared in the &quot;Statement&quot; of 16th February 1940:20 by opening of a well-equipped Provincial Veterinary Laboratory and a Livestock Research Station. It is obvious that the disease control work of the Province cannot be effectively carried out unless we have means at our disposal to diagnose diseases promptly and accurately for supply of potent Sera and Vaccines with equal promptness and accuracy. The Province is spend- ing Rs. 1,12,870 on the control of contagious diseases and yet there are no facilities for the professional staff to obtain prompt and accurate diagnosis. On the livestock improvement side the position is equally peculiar as in the absence of a Research Station it is impossible to have accurate and reliable information regarding Livestock problems. In the absence of a Livestock Research Station neither Small Scale Live- stockbreeding can be carried out according to the re- quirements of the Province, nor it is possible to make any lasting progress in the Livestock Improvement work. Until the Province is in a position to be able to replace, at will, the stud animals of whatever improved species are introduced into the Province, no Livestock Scheme is likely to produce results of a permanent nature. The outstanding features of the year under report are the success that it has achieved in the control of livestock diseases, particularly Rinderpest, by the use of locally prepared Goat Tissue Virus Vaccine and the re- arrangement of the livestock breeding activities on a more comprehensive and scientific footing. It would not be out of place to record that in the latter half of the year under report minimum number of transfers of the professional staff were effected which apart from being economical materially contributed towards the better functioning of the Department as a unit. I wish to thank all Deputy Commissioners and Political Agents, particularly Mr. Curtis, Deputy Com- missioner, Hazara and Major Mallam, Political Agent, Dir, Swat and Chitral, for their ceaseless efforts in assist- ing to enhance the usefulness of the Department to the zamindars. I also wish to record my appreciation of the co- operation rendered by the members of the Department

Review by the Government of the North-West Frontier Province of the Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department for the year 1940-41. Mr. S. M. Sarwar remained Head of the Veterinary Department throughout the year under report. The post of Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, was revived in order to improve the general administration thus leaving the Head of the Department more free to tour and attend to constructive work. Prompt vaccination prevented any serious spread of cattle diseases although the number of out-breaks were much the same as usual. Poultry diseases, however, increased seriously, possibly owing to the difficulty of diagnosis. In order to rectify this the Provincial Government in co- operation with the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research have appointed a special officer to investigate and recom- mend measures for control of poultry diseases. Only three new hospitals were opened during the year as the Govern- ment continued their policy of improving the existing hospitals rather than adding to their number. In spite of this, however, there was an all-round increase in the number of animals treated and castrations performed. In cattle breeding attention was chiefly directed to re- organisation, branding and redistribution in specific areas of breeding stock most suitable for that locality. In this the Provincial Government are indebted to Mr. Ware, Animal Husbandry Commissioner, for the advice given during his tour. In conclusion, the Government wish to express their appreciation of the zeal and energy displayed by Mr. Sarwar for the reorganisation and improvements carried out by him and for his concise report. W. C. LEEPER, Secretary to Government, North-West Frontier Province, Development Departments. GS&PDeptt-NWFPANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH-WEST FRONTIE R PROVINCE FOR THE YEAR 1940-41 PART I-GENERAL ADMINISTRATION 1. Superintendent2 Dhanni Cattle Breeding tract was visited for pur- chase of stud bulls. A very widespread and severe outbreak of Rinder- pest was promptly and effectively controlled in the Swat State by drafting control measures on the spot and supervising the Goat Virus Inoculation work in the field and supply of the vaccine from the Laboratory. During the year under report the Local Govern- ment was pleased to declare the Superintendent as head of the Department. This step though very much wel- comed still further increased the responsibilities of the post. Inspite of increase in the already heavy responsi- bilities I managed to discharge the duties of the Officer Incharge Provincial Veterinary Laboratory though at considerable personal inconvenience. As in the previous year large number of major surgical operations were performed wherever such cases were brought to notice. Peshawar Veterinary Hospital was visited at frequent intervals for professional advice to the staff and for the performance of major surgical operations requiring special surgical skill. I acted as an examiner in the subjects of Materia Medica and Obstetrics at the Biannual Examination of the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore. All meetings of the Imperial Council or Agricultural Research were attended. The Karaku Pelt Production Scheme was passed by the Imperial Council of Agricul- tural Research for commencement on 1st April 1941. F. Ware, Esquire, Animal Husbandary Commissioner with the Government of India paid a visit to this Province. He toured in the Mardan, Peshawar and Hazara Districts to see the livestock development work in the Province. As a result of his study of the work in hand he rendered very valuable advise regarding further lines of work. He also inspected the Agricul- tural Farm, Haripur at the request of the Local Govern- ment to advice regarding the possibilities of converting that farm into a Livestock Research Station. The area of the farm was considered insufficient for the purpose and new site at village Togh, Kohat District was there- fore handed over to the Department by the Local Gov- ernment for starting a Livestock Research Station.
3 The Local Government was pleased to revive the post of Deputy Superintendent of Civil Veterinary Department from 1st April 1941. 2. District Veterinary offices - The District Veterinary Offices at Headqu arters remained in the charge of experienced veterinarians. They were of great help to the Central Office and the officals incharge worked hard to carry out the duties imposed upon them. They laboured hard to attend the outbreak reports in the districts. The Local Gov- ernment very kindly sanctioned appointment of Chap- rasis for the district incharges to facilitate their touring work. 3. Subordinate establishment The following table shows the strength of subordi- nate staff during the year 1939-40 and 1940-41 :4 that the laboratory functioned better than ever before and met all the requirements of the district staff ade- quately and promptly. Purchase and supply of Sera and Vaccine was so arranged that the supply was prompt and yet there was no wastage. The laboratory attended to the require- ments of 267 outbreaks of various contagious diseases. 507 blood smears and 46 faeces specimens were exa- mined and reported upon. All possible facilities were provided to the Veteri- nary Investigation Officer and his laboratory require- ments were net promptly. 86,900 doses of Goat Tissue Virus Vaccine were prepared in the laboratary during the year and 75,700 were supplied in viable condition to the district staff for inoculation work. Experiments were conducted in the use of a spe- cially designed instrument for inoculating animals with Goat Tissu Virus Vaccine but few modifications were indicated. In view of the urgent neccessity of having a proper laboratory building the Local Government was pleased to acquire a suitable plot of land for the purpose. In the ensuing year funds will probably be provided for the construction of an uptodate laboratory build- ing. 5. Investigation5 Parasitic Broncho Pneumonia. Reports alleged to be that of Pleuro-pneumonia were each time confirmed as those of Parasitic pneumonia. Owners were advised to dose sheep and goats regularly with Copper Sulphate. Pleura Pneumonia in Goats.- Considerable field study was made regarding the symptomology and etiology of the so called pleuro pneumonia in goats. No definite results were however obtained and the work is to be continued under directions of the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar. Liver fluke in cattle, sheep and goats.6 Only 2 other cases of Surra were recorded 1 from Kohat and 1 from Dargai which were also successfully treated. Anthrax7 dose of the Anti-Rinderpest Serum and the best time of its administration also to be determined. 2. Hæmorrahagic Septiæmia.8 year under report, which is due to the effective veteri- nary aid rendered to the sick animals. Anthrax accounted for 2 deaths out of 5 seizures in Malakand Agency as compared with 150 deaths out of 473 seizures of the last year. Pox amongst sheep resulted in one death out of 6 seizures as compared with 42 deaths out of 100 seizures last year. These low figures of seizures and deaths are probably due to the zamin- dars ignoring the disease on account of its common occurrence. 19 cases o sheep scab were diagnosed and treated successfully. Distemper.9 SECTION (C) NON-CONTAGIOUS DISEASES TREATED ON TOUR10 of animals treated as indoor and outdoor patients, rose from 319,893 in the preceding year to 331,330 during the year under report. The number of castra- tions performed also rose from 66,731 to 70,636. 40,718 animals were supplied with medicine without atten- dance as compared with 35,865 of the previous year. 2. Outlying Dispensaries11 SECTION B12 the stud bulls of this breed were confined to the Dist- ricts Peshawar, Mardan, Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan, and Haripur Tehsil of the Hazara District. There are some stud bulls of this breed in the Kohat District but it is likely that all these bulls will in due course be replaced by Lohani Bulls. No definite decision has, however, been arrived at in this connection. The scheme of rearing stud bulls locally out of subsidized pure Dhanni Cows made considerable pro- gress. Nearly 10 calves with good breed characteristics were selected and branded to be reared for stud pur- poses. Some of the breeders of the Province proved very enthusiastic about this scheme and were very keen on this enterprise. The question of improvement of milk yield of Dhanni Cows remained under consideration of the Department but no definite line of action was decided upon as development of milk yield is intimately related with the fodder resources of the different tracts of the Province. The condition of the stud animals was on the whole very satisfactory especially in Bannu and Mardan Districts. In the beginning of year there were 347 Dhanni Bulls out of which 105 were cast. About the end of the year 19 more bulls were enter- tained on scheme bringing the total to 261. 21,231 coverings were performed as against 26,781 of the last year. The progeny of the stud bulls was a definite improvement on the indigenous cattle and the scheme continued to enjoy popularity amongst zamindars of the Province. The quality of the progeny has improved to such an extent in the Haripur and Peshawar Tehsils that the breeders from Dhanni tract of the Punjab are beginning to puchase calves from these areas. Efforts are being made to discourage the local zamindars from selling their valuable stock at early age. 2. Lohani Cattle Breeding[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]
[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]
13 It is hoped that the puchase of these calves for stud purposes would act as a stimulus to the breeders. The proposed livestock research station for Lohani cattle breeding did not start during the year for financial reasons but its necessity has been realized by the Local Government. A few selected bulls, cows and calves of of this breed were exhibited at the Third and Fourth All India Cattle Shows held at New Delhi in the years 1940 and 1941. The animals exhibited were collected from Kurram Agency and Kohat District. In the Third All India Cattle Show only bulls and cows were entered and 2 first and 2 second prizes were won. Whereas in the Fourth All India Cattle Show calves were also exhibited and 3 first and 3 second prizes were won. This resulted in increased stimulus for this breed in the Kohat District and Kurram Agency. The Zamindars have since then been making enquiries about the next Delhi Show. In the Kurram Agency there were 45 bulls and 8 cows on subsidy scheme at the beginning of the year 7 bulls were cast leaving the balance of 38. The strength would be brought to 50 bulls and 10 cows by purchase during the ensuing year. 1957 cows were covered during the year as against, 1,753 of the last year. The number of coverings increased inspite of the lesser number of stud bulls which was the result of the in- creased interest taken by the breeders. 3. Dajjal Cattle Breeding14 cities of Peshawar, Bannu and Mardan in each of which one Montgomery Bull was at stud. 187 cows were covered as against 183 of the last year. 6. Buffalo Breeding15 SECTION D16 number of country goats and the second cross female. The third cross kid that was born during the year was such an improvement on the second cross that it is with considerable difficulty that one is able to distinguish between the pure bred and the third cross. It is hoped that pure Angora buck and goat would be taken over for breeding work at the Livestock Research Station Togh17 Local Governmens in creating the post of Assistant Veterinary Investigation Officer (Poultry) for study of Poultry diseases. The post will be financed by the Local Government and Imperial Council of Agricultural Research on 5018 Agency and Kurram Agency. All the shows were a dis- tinct improvement upon all previous shows at Abbotta- bad, Haripur, Peshawar, Dera Ismail Khan Malakand Agency and Kurram Agency deserve very special men- tion. His Excellency Sir George Cunningham, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E., O.B.E, Governor of the North-West Frontier Province, was kind enough to grace the show grounds at Haripur, Peshawar and Kurram Agency. His Excellency exhibited very keen interest in the livestock development work and created a special stimulus amongst the breeders by inspecting each prize winner and making personal enquiries from the owners of the animals and by giving away prizes at the Peshawar and Kurram Agency Shows. Lieut.-Colonel W. F. Campbell, I. A., Adviser to His Mxcellency the Governor, North-West Frontier Province also took very keen interest in the Livestock Development Work and paid visits to the Baffa, Haripur and Peshawar Shows, where he critically examined all different aspects of the livestock activities of the Department and established personal contact with the breeders. Major W. C. Leeper, I. A., Secertary to Government, North- West Frontier Province, Development Departments visited Baffa and Abbottabad Shows with a view to establish intimate contact with the activities of the Department. L. W. Jardine, Esquire, C. I. E., Revenue and Divisional Commissioner, North-West Frontier Prevince, was kind enough to pay visits to the Abbott- abad and Peshawar Shows. At all the shows in addition to exhibition of livestock, various sports items were included in the programme to create additional attrac- tion and to thus collect larger gatherings at these shows. The sports attraction at the Abbottabad, Haripur, Peshawar and Dera Ismail Khan were on very extensive scale and thousands of zamindars visited the show grounds. For the education of the visitors demonstra- tion stalls were installed at each show where Depart- mental leaflets, posters, charts, specimens and photo- graphs of interest were exhibited. Lectures were also delivered with a view to acquaint the zamindars with common important contagious diseases and their control and broad principles of livestock Development. In addi- tion to the above enumerated shows a large number of one day cattle show were held in different villages of
19 each District. These village shows are daily becoming increasingly popular and are providing facilities for the Departmental Officers to study the progress on the spot in each locality. As in the previous year Lohani Cattle (5 bulls, 5 cows and 5 calves) were exhibited at the Fourth All India Cattle Show where 3 first and 3 second prizes were won in the Lohani Class. This breed as a result of the exhibition at the Show has attracted the attention of the livestock Departments of various other Provinces. General20 at our disposal to check the stud animals in cases of mischievous replacement or theft. In sheep breeding the Merino cross breeding scheme in District Hazara received a definite set back as the Merino stud rams that died during the year could not be replaced.

With regard to the working of the Veterinary Hospitals the work in these institutions increased as under :21 Department both professional and non-professional in enhancing the activities of the Department particularly Abdul Wahid Khan, Veterinary Assistant, Surgeon Abdullah Khan, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Muham- mad Azam Khan, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon and Ghulam Sarwar Khan Head Clerk. &S&PDeptt.NWFPSTATEMENTS

Review by the Government of the North-West Frontier Province of the Annual Report of the Provincial Animal Husbandry Department for the year 1945-46. During the year under report the Department was in charge of Mr. Aziz Ahmad. The Department worked at a disadvantage not only because, owing to the war, drugs and equipment were difficult to obtain, but also because it was charged with the onerous task of managing the Meat Dehydration Factory at Nowshera. This factory which was the biggest of its kind in India supplied dehydrated meat to the Supply Department of the Government of India for the armed forces. When it is stated that its budget was nearly 15 times as great as that of the Department it will be appreciated that during this period the Director and the Departmental Officers who assisted him carried heavy responsibilities. It is satisfactory therefore to put on record that this factory was most efficiently administered. Within its proper sphere the Department's outstanding achieve- ment during the year was the inauguration of the manufacture at the Provincial Veterinary Laboratory of Ranikhet Disease Virus Vaccine. The main obstacle in the way of establishing a flourishing poultry industry in this Province has been the ravages of Ranikhet Disease. As this vaccine becomes available it will be possible for poultry owners to protect their birds against this deadly scourage. It would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of this development to the rural economy of the Province. Useful work was done in the propagation of the Dhanni, Sindhi, Lohani and Montgomery breeds of cattle on which it has been decided to concentrate. Buffalo breeding however did not make much pro- gress owing to heavy mortality among young stock which it is believed was a feature of the year in other parts of India; and the Karakul Pelt Production Scheme suffered a set back owing to the incidence of disease. Bovine diseases were energetically tackled in the field 42,720 animals being immunised against Rinderpest and measures taken to deal with Hæmorrhagic Septicaemia met some success. In spite of the shortage of drugs and equipment the total number of animals treated at hospitals showed a very considerable increase thereby demonstrating the growing confidence of the public in the Department.

ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, FOR THE YEAR 1945-46. PART I2 Assistant Veterinary Investigation Officer (Poultry) in the preparation of Ranikhet Disease Virus Vaccine and the Veterinary Investigation Officer in general M. Nazar Muhammad, a Laboratory Assistant was sent to the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, for advance studies. During the year under review 1,370 Blood Smears, faecal samples, nasal discharges, skin scrapings, etc., were examined. 106,400 doses of Goat Tissue Virus Vaccine were manufactured as against 1,96,800 doses prepared last year. Out of 1,06,400 doses 88,800 doses were supplied to the field staff for prophylactic inoculation and for the control of outbreaks of Rinderpest. Large quantities of all sorts of sera and vaccine indented from the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, were stocked at the Provincial Veterinatry Laboratory and then distributed amongst the staff throughout the Province. The work on the preparation of Ranikhet Disease Vaccine was taken up for the first time in this Province on 1st January 1946, and on the recommendation of the Director, Veterinary Services, the Provincial Government converted the post of the Assistant Veterinary Investigation Officer (Poultry), to a P. V. S. Class II. An adequate amount to meet the expenses of the scheme was placed at the disposal of the Assistant Veterinary Investigation Officer (Poultry) who was also given a Poultry Assistant and a Clerk to assist him. It is hoped to produce the first brew of the vaccine in the very near future. Provincial Veterinary Hospital3 saline solution) inoculated subcutaneously in the tip of the ear in the face of actual outbreak was continued with considerable success in Khyber, Kurram and Malakand Agencies. 3. Clinical Nutritional Survey4 Institute. In the absence of any suitable vaccine, prompt symptomatic treatm en was given by the field staff and the disease kept under control by advising the villagers to segregate the diseased animals. Poultry Disease Investigation5 7. Scaly Lags6 The scheme originally began on 1st March 1942 and is due to end on the 31st March 1947. It has been in operation in Charsadda Tehsil, Peshawar District. The objective of this scheme are to promote the hide trade of the Province and to reduce economic loss in the hide trade through faulty flaying and defective curing Four flaying centres were instituted in Charsadda Tehsil. 140 flayers were trained in the art of proper manner of take-off hide from animal body, cleaning, packing, etc by practical demonstrations. The flayers used the improved knives under the instructions of the Officer Incharge. All the centres were provided with the requisite number of kerosene oil lamps for use during the dark hours in which the flaying work was done. The Incharge regularly visited these centres every month and check- ed the work of the Master-flayers. In order to encourage better flaying premium at the rate of Re. -/4/- per hide flayed 1st class was introduc- ed. The results achieved were most satisfactory. Extensive propaganda was also carried out by the officer-in-charge in different villages-regard- ing proper flaying of hides. During the year under report, 10,895 pieces of hides were flaved 1st class and only 13 pieces were damaged due to cuts. This clearly shows that the percentage of cuts has gradually been brought to the minimum through constant propaganda, use of approved knives, adequate lighting arrangements and education of the actual flayers. Village Shearing and Grading Centres Scheme7 11,686 sheep were shorn and 14,040 lbs. of wool collected during the year. The Buffalo Breeding Farm, Islamia College, Peshawar8 3. Black quarter.9 in the Province including the Agencies and the States. These institu- tions gave veterinary aid to the live-stock of the poor Zamindars. In addition, the sera and vaccine supplied to these institutions were promptly utilised to control the various contagious diseases. Most of the hospitals and dispensaries were regularly visited by the Director, Veterinary Services, North-West Frontier Province. As a result of this careful supervision there was marked improvement in the quality of work. Furthermore, occasional surprise visits to more important hospitals always kept the staff on the qui-vive. Every effort was made to keep the hospitals and dispensaries well supplied with modern drugs and country medicines. The total number of animals treated at these hospitals as indoor and outdoor patients was 381,549 as compared with 332,621 of the last year. 50,774 animal owners who were not able to bring their animals to the hospitals were supplied with medicines. 84,365 animals were castrated as against 67,339 of the last year. 2. Touring Dispensaries10 amongst the breeders of Hazara, Mardan and Peshawar District. In the beginning of the year 147 bulls were present on the subsidy scheme. 40 were cast and 15 entertained during the year bringing the balance 122 at the end of the year and performed 8,069 coverings as compared with the 11,940 coverings performed during the last year. The Dhanni cows which were purchased from the Dhanni Tracts and located with Zamindars on the subsidy scheme were 44 in the beginning of the year. At the end of the year 47 cows were left. The owners of these cows were requested to rear the progency of these cows to the breeding age when these would be purchased for stud purposes. 2. Sindhi Cattle Breeding11 purpose pure-bred rams were issued for stud purposes to selected breeders in Hazara District. In the beginning of the year there were 15 rams on the subsidy scheme. During the year no ram could be entertained. At the close of the year 15 rams were present. These rams covered 113 ewes. Goat Breading.12 This indicates the success of the scheme in Hazara District which this Department has launched only very recently. On the last day of the Show the prize winning animals were paraded before the gathering and the prizes were given away by the Revenue and Divisional Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province. The Hon'ble Minister for Industries visited the Show grounds on the last day of Show. Provincial Live-Stock Show13 GENERAL REMARKS. My thanks are due to Lieut.-Col. Mallam, C. I. E., I. P.
