No. 539 E.-197ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PRINCE OF WALES' MEDICAL COLLEGE, PATNA FOR THE YEAR 1925-26. Historical sketch.2 Hostel.3 1926 when he was officially appointed as senior demonstrator of Physiology he started work on his own department where he has had to arrange the appliances and chemicals, indent for the deficiencies and see whether the instruments were working all in order. In the absence of his Professor he has had the sole responsibility of this department and has completed the arrangement for the Physiology department. Dr. B. Narain has been of help to Dr. Prasad in fitting up the motors and drums of the experimental room, preparing chemicals, and stock reagents and cutting sections for the class purposes. Dr. Prasad made himself generally useful in the organisation of the College and supervi- sion of the equipment of the basement room which is to serve as the central depôt of stores for all the departments in future. *Who joined this department on December 11th, 1925. Materia Medica and Pharmacology.4 disinfected and no further cases occurred. It is of interest to note that this student was one of the two who did not attend the vaccination parade held in the hostel as soon as the outbreak was anticipated. Four monitors were appointed from among the College students each of whom was allotted a room on the upper floor. The discipline was on the whole satisfactory. ATHLETICS. The College students formed an association of their own which opened its activities with a fancy foot-ball match between students and staff. Some Tennis and hockey were played during the year and efforts were made to secure boats for rowing on the river. On account of the paucity of the number of students this side of college life could not fully develop. Annual sports were held on the 23rd February 1926, in which college and school students competed together. The nursing staff were 5 FINANCE.

Priced Publications of the Government of Bihar and Orissa can be had fromNo. 7901/E.-1382 The question which presently overshadows all others is that of obtaining the recognition by the General Medical Council of the medical qualifications of the University. The report of Sir Norman Walker has been closely studied and as a result of repeated conferences between myself and the Principal and his staff considered. recommendations have been made to Government. Acceptance of these recommendations will, besides almost commending recognition, raise the standard of teaching to a high level. Government will I hope agree with me that the report shews steady progress and efficient internal administration, I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, W. S. WILLMORE, M.D., M.R.C.P., COL., I.M.S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Bihar and Orissa.
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PRINCE OF WALES' MEDICAL COLLEGE PATNA, FOR THE YEAR 19272 completed as far as the building is concerned, but since the foundation of the proposed new Public Health Laboratory is not within sight yet, it is feared it will be long before the Physiology department can have full possession of the whole building. A two-storeyed Animal House which has nearly been completed will be put to use next year to accommodate animals for experimental and routine work of the different departments of the college. New quarters for the Professor of Surgery are under construction and expected to be ready for occupation next July. A crane has been provided in the cold storage room to facilitate the lifting of the ice manufactured. A safety signal which can be worked by persons accidentally impressed in that room has also been added to it. Visitors.3 His Excellency the Hon'ble Sir Hugh Lansdown Stephenson visited the college on March 14th, 1928, in connection with the construction of a new hostel and the Radium Institute. Colonel Willmore, Lieutenant-Colonel Sprawson and Dr. Caldwell visited the college on March 30th, 1928, as University Inspectors and will submit their report in due time. Changes in the staff.4 Forty-seven journals were subscribed for and 50 new books were purchased during the year which raised the total of books from 1,033 to 1,083. Our library is yet far from respectable regarding books of reference and back sets of journals without which research work cannot satisfactorily be carried on. Another substantial grant is needed for the library. Teaching staff.5 practical histology, a subject which is put under the department of Anatomy in progressive and new schools of medicine but which is perhaps better not disturbed in this college so long as the existing conditions of the building and equipment of the departments concerned are not changed.

Introductory.2 Additional buildings .3 Dr. Reid, an experienced teacher of repute from the University of Aberdeen, has been appointed in Dr. Cruickshank4 been extended very considerably with addition of the Pasteur Institute and the Bacteriological Laboratory not to mention the growth of the departmental museum which is systematically going on from the beginning and on which the professor is bestowing his very special and anxious cares. A new system on the lines of European teaching centres has been introduced during the last three months in that the unpaid clinical Assistants of the Patna Medical College Hospital carry out the laboratory investigation of their patients in the hospital every afternoon. Thus it is possible to make a complete study of a patient on modern scientific lines. A technician has been appointed permanently as a caretaker of the Patho- logical Museum. Mounting work is proceeding satisfactorily since his appointment. One hundred and one new wet specimens, obtained from England and Vienna, have been added. to the previous collections. Also 103 coloured lantern slides on Morbid Anatomy and 33 Bacteriological cultures for exhibi- tion in the Museum have been received from Vienna.

The club is busy with framing rules for its guidance, and it is hoped that they will be ready before the next session commences. The credit for all these improvements is due to Professor Hyder Ali Khan under whom the club is making a rapid progress. Dramatic Performances.6 2. 7 TABLE A.

Priced Publications of the Government of Bihar and Orissa can be had from,No. 16682TENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Prince of Wales Medical College, Patna, 1934-35. IN the last annual report a brief description of the damages caused by the earthquake on the 15th January 1934 was given. The buildings which sustained considerable damage were the laboratories of the departments of Physiology and Pathology, the Administrative Block and the Students' Hostel. As the repairs to the damaged College buildings were only partially completed when the College re-opened on the 16th July 1934 temporary arrangements had to be made during the first term. The repairs were completed by the end of October 1934. The Governing Body.2 2. The College accounts for the period from 1931-32 to 1933-34 were audited on 9th November 1934. The report is not available yet. The last audit was held in 1928 for the period from 1925-26 to 1926-27. 3. The Cold Storage Plant which forms an important unit in the College broke down for a few days during the first term on account of the wear and tear of certain parts but was promptly repaired. 4. The supply of gas to the laboratories was very unsatisfactory on account of the old pipes having suffered damage during the earthquake. They have been completely replaced at a cost of Rs. 2,600. 5. The method of collection of College fees and other dues has been improved. The disbursement of salary of the establishment is now made under the supervision of a gazetted officer. 6. A Committee of the teaching staff has been formed to scrutinize the attendances and the results of the terminal examinations of the students before they are sent up for the University Examination. 7. Indents on the Medical Stores Depot, the verification of the articles on arrival and their distribution to the various departments are controlled by a small committee. 8. The management of the animal house and of the general stores has been improved under the close supervision of the Professor of Biology and Physiology respectively. 9. The much required improvement of the College grounds has been taken in hand. 10. The College Council met on three occasions during the year. The proceedings of the Council are now properly recorded.

The college entered on its eleventh session on the 16th July 1935. The Governing Body.2 (2) There has been no trouble with the Cold Storage Plant during the period under review. (3) The replacement of the old gas pipes which suffered damages during the earthquake of 1934, at a cost of Rs. 2,600 has been very satisfactory in its results. (4) Constant supervision is made in the collection of fees and other dues. With a view to meeting the requirements of the University with regard to students who failed to appear at or pass an examination, special revision lectures have been arranged and revision fees have been charged for these extra lectures. This, apart from increasing contributions to the State and. satisfying the University requirements, has been a benefit to backward students. (5) The College Council met on seven occasions during the year. It is, however, considered that the college council, as it is constituted at present, is an unwieldy body. It is desirable that the membership should be limited only to the Heads of Departments. The following changes have taken place during the period under report:3 6. Ophthalmology.4 7. Hostel.5 The Professor of Pathology has also consented to demonstrate the technique of such complicated tests as the Aschheim-Zondak and Freidman's test to the students attending the lectures in Obstetrics. A request to the Superintendent of the Radium Institute is being made to demonstrate to students the treatment of malignant uterine diseases and other female complaints by radium. The following additions have been made and the following improvements effected in the Departments: Biology:6 (2) An investigation on the action of Evipan Sodium on the blood sugar of rabbits.
