?REPORT ON MALARIA IN THE PUNJAB DURING THE YEAR 1913. I.-Introduction. IT has not up to the present been the practice to submit any formal report in regard to the annual incidence of malaria in the Punjab, nor has it been considered necessary to summarise the work of the Punjab Malaria Bureau. It is thought, however, that a periodical review dealing with these matters will serve a useful purpose, and it is therefore proposed to submit for the informa- tion of Government an annual report solely devoted to the subject of malaria. Some of the reasons which suggest the expediency of adopting this course may be mentioned. In the first place there is no disease in the Punjab, not excluding plague, to compare with malaria in point of prevalence and impor- tance. It affects all races and every social grade, and the classes as well as the masses pay an annual tribute to its ravages. It is one of the chief causes of infantile mortality in this Province, and its influence on the birth rate is only less marked than on the death rate. It is therefore no exaggeration to state that malaria is the dominant factor in the pathology of the Punjab. Secondly, a short annual review of the situation in regard to malaria will form a permanent record of the course of events. Again, in view of the fact that a special department, although of a small and temporary nature, has been created in this Province for the study of malaria and for the preparation of schemes for its amelioration it seems expedient that it should render some account of its stewardship. Finally, the submission of an annual report offers an opportunity of in- dicating the aims and objects of the department and of recording any progress that may have been made in the systematic study of the disease and in the eluci- dation of measures necessary for its control. II.-General considerations. In submitting the first of these reports it will be expedient to refer briefly to some of the main features in regard to the incidence of the disease in the past. Confining attention solely to the period since 1867, when vital statistics first became available, it must suffice to state that malaria has prevailed with a varying degree of severity throughout every district of the Province during the forty-seven years that have elapsed since 1867. During the major portion of this period the disease has been attended with an average annual mortality of about 350,000, but in certain years, notably in 1878, 1879, 1890, 1892, 1900 and 1908 the fever mortality has been greatly in excess of this; in 1908, for example, the malaria mortality for the months of October and November alone reached the enormous figure of 300,000. The annual mortality from malaria is shown in Chart I of Appendix A, which also exhibits the relationship of the "fever" mortality to the total mortality from all causes. The two chief points which the chart emphasises are the relatively high proportion the fever mortality bears to the total mortality and the marked oscillations to which the "fever" mortality in the Punjab is subject. The latter point, however, is best brought out in Chart II wherein the annual fever mortality during the months of October and November for the above period is depicted. As it is proposed to bring these charts up-to-date and in- clude them each year in these reports it will be expedient here to consider the value attaching to the figures on which they are based. The recording of vital statistics in India, it is well known, leaves much to be desired in point of accuracy. It is generally believed that the total mortality returns are for the most part approximately accurate, but this view has not,
2 so far as is known, been established in the Punjab by any systematic investi- gation conducted over a large area.    It may, however, be stated that a recent inquiry in one area suggested that the total mortality figures were not appreci- ably underestimated. In regard to the "fever" mortality it is not possible to speak with the same degree of confidence, for the determination of the cause of death is in most cases made, by the village chaukidar, whose powers of diagnosis are neces- sarily somewhat limited. A critical analysis of chaukidars' books -recently carried out led to the conclusion that these returns are not so inaccurate as might at first sight be expected. Entries such as "tumours," "suppression of urine," "labour," " para- lysis," "phthisis," "renal colic," as well as "measles," "cholera," "plague" and "malaria" suggest that whilst the diagnosis is often vague, considerable discrimination is used, and deaths are not wantonly attributed to "fever" when another well defined cause of death is present. Whilst therefore a number of deaths are no doubt incorrectly ascribed to this disease, there is at present no reason to believe that these statistics are gravely inaccurate so far as malaria is concerned. The extent of the inaccuracy has been variously esti- mated by different observers, but in view of the fact that it probably varies both from year to year and also in different parts of same district it is difficult to gauge accurately the extent to which the provincial figures are vitiated by errors of this nature. A further complication is introduced by the fact that malaria so fre- quently supervenes in the course of other diseases that it must often contribute to a fatal termination in cases where it is not the primary disease; again, the occurrence of an acute disease, such as pneumonia, in an individual enfeebled by long-standing malaria will be more likely to end fatally than in the case of an healthy individual. Whilst therefore necessity exists for "correcting" the provincial vital statistics the matter is one of considerable difficulty. The error in the returns of "fever" mortality is, however, one which must be more or less of a constant nature from year to year. It therefore cannot be the cause of those marked oscillations in the fever deaths which form such a prominent feature of Chart II. In regard to the latter it is possible to speak with an unusual degree of confidence, for Major Christophers has been able to show that the marked rises in the autumnal "fever" mortality are due to malaria and malaria alone. For, in the case of the year 1908, he has con- clusively shown that the abnormal fever mortality of that year occurred at a time when malaria alone was prevalent, that it was accompanied everywhere in an increase in dispensary admissions for what was clinically malaria, and that it was followed by a noticable increase in the number of people attending hospital for splenic enlargement. Finally, he was able to prove that in certain areas the people exhibited at the conclusion of the epidemic an almost universal infection with malaria parasites. The conclusion therefore may be reached that, whilst endemic malaria prevails to a varying extent throughout the province, giving rise to an annual mortality, the exact extent of which can only be approximately estimated, the disease periodically manifests itself in epidemic form, when it is attended by a greatly enhanced mortality, the extent of which may be gauged with a considerable degree of accuracy by measuring the excess over normal of the recorded fever mortality. It is thus clear that malaria in the Punjab is a disease "exercising a pre- dominant influence over the well-being of its inhabitants. But the damage wrought by malaria cannot be measured from mortality bills alone, for even in years, such as the one under review, when no autumnal epidemic occurred, it. causes a serious amount of sickness and ill-health, and perhaps more subtle of all, a loss of energy and initiative in the apparently healthy, which though incapable of direct measurement, is of incalculable importance.
3 Finally, it is necessary to emphasise the fact, already alluded to, that malaria in the Punjab is subject to spontaneous fluctuations of considerable magnitude, so that a series of mild years may and often is followed by an out- break of great severity. It would be out of place to discuss here the signifi- cance of this point, and it must suffice to state that it has recently been found possible to explain the reason for these periodic waves of increase and decrease in prevalence and virulence. The point that it is chiefly desired to bring out here is the fact that these fluctuations are a normal feature in the epidemiology of malaria in this Province. The recognition of this circumstance is a matter of considerbale importance, and it is obvious that it must always be taken into account when any opinion is being formed in regard to the effect of anti- malarial measures; for it will be readily understood that, if this point is not appreciated, wrong deductions may be made in regard to the value of these measures. III.-The distribution of endemic malaria. Malaria in the Punjab requires consideration in its aspect as an endemic disease and as an epidemic, and it is expedient, for reasons which need not be referred to here, that these two manifestations of the disease should be clearly distinguished from one another. Malaria is endemic practically throughout all parts of the plains of the Punjab, whilst severe epidemics (fulminant malaria) occur only in certain years and in well-defined tracts. It may be said at once that the year under review was noteworthy as one in which epidemic malaria was entirely absent from the Province, and it thus affords a favourable opportunity for the study of the endemic disease. Utilising the recorded fever mortality as the only index available of its prevalence it is found that the malaria mortality for the Province as a whole was 331,698, which is equivalent to a death-rate of 17.15 per 1,000 of population. It is not considered necessary to compare the death-rate with that of previous years as the spontaneous manner in which the fever mortality is subject to fluctuation suggests that it would not serve any useful purpose to do so. The one point, however, that may be mentioned is the fact that during the five years that have elapsed since the severe 1908 epidemic the average annual fever mortality has been lower than in any other quinquennium during the past thirty years. This point is of some significance more particularly in view of the fact that public opinion is inclined to believe that malaria in the Punjab is on the increase as the result of canal irrigation. There is, however, no reason to believe that this favourable state of affairs will continue indefinitely; on the contrary, reasons have been deduced elsewhere which go to show that this decline in malaria mortality is of a purely temporary nature, and that its maintenance can only be anticipated to continue until the occurrence of the next exceptionally heavy monsoon. Coming now to the distribution of this mortality both as regards time and place the monthly fever mortality for each district of the Punjab together with other details is given in the table in Appendix B. The mortality figures of districts taken as a whole, however, are open to the objection that they cover too wide an area, and it is proposed in future to utilise the thana, as suggested by Major Christophers, as the unit for the study of malaria in rural areas. But even the use of this unit is not altogether satisfactory since thanas sometimes comprise areas possessing physiographical features of a widely varying nature. A scrutiny of the table shows that the ratio of the fever mortality per 1,000 of population during 1913 was highest in the Karnal, Ambala and Rawalpindi Districts where the figure were 24.8, 24.43 and 23.38, respectively, whilst in Muzaffargarh, Mianwali and Attock these ratios were 21.95, 20.68 and 19.86.
4 The districts showing the lowest fever death-rate were Simla (10.69), Montgomery (10.99), Ferozepore (11.05) and Ludhiana (11.92). It is not, however, desirable to attempt to draw many conclusions from a consideration of the figures for one year only. The sole deduction which it is thought may be legitimately drawn from a scrutiny of the fever death-rates for the year 1913 is that the mortality from malaria tended in many cases to be higher in those districts which are not subject to severe epidemics as compared with districts containing the main "epidemic areas." This fact is demonstrat- ed in the map attached to this report (Appendix C) in which the areas involved in the extensive 1908 epidemic are shown in red, whilst the fever mortality per 1,000 of population for each district has been entered in green. It should, however, be clearly understood that during the year under review there has been no epidemic of malaria in any part of the Province, and that five years have elapsed since the occurrence of the last epidemic. It may therefore be tentatively concluded that the circumstances favour- ing a high degree of malarial endemicity are not solely those which favour the occurrence of fulminant epidemics. Conversely, the deduction may be made that in areas subject to these epidemics conditions exceptionally favourable to the endemic form of the disease are not necessarily present to a marked degree during epidemic free periods. As further observations, which support and extend these conclusions, have been embodied in a research which will shortly be published, it is unnecessary to make further reference to this sub- ject here. Finally, in Chart III the fever mortality during each month of the year under review is depicted. A scrutiny of the chart shows that a slight decline in mortality took place in February as compared with the previous month, thereafter the fever mor- tality remained steady during March and April, but was followed by a slight but distinct rise during May. In June there is a decrease in mortality which is continued throughout July and August, with the result that the two latter months were the healthier from the point of view of malaria than any others months during the year. The chief feature of the chart, however, is the com- paratively marked nature of the increase in fever mortality during the month of October, and its maintenance until the close of the year. For the present it must suffice to state that the above represents the monthly distribution of fever mortality in a year when endemic malaria was less conspicuous than usual and when epidemic malaria was almost entirely absent. For, until all the known factors influencing malaria have been collected and studied over a series of years it will not be possible to draw final conclusions in regard to the  year under review. This report is therefore of an ad interim nature, and it must be regarded merely as indicating the lines on which more comprehensive reports will be based in future. IV.-Epidemic malaria in 1913. There is fortunately little to be said in regard to epidemic malaria during the year under review, for, as has already been mentioned, no outbreak of ful- minant malaria has taken place in the Province since the severe epidemic of 1908. In fact the sum of the fever mortality for the months of October and November for the past five years is only slightly in excess of the same figure for the year 1908. Major Christophers has shown that by means of the use of "epidemic figures" it is possible to ascertain the occurrence of epidemic malaria, to measure its severity and to map out with a considerable degree of accuracy its local distribution. As it will be frequently necessary to refer to these epidemic figures it will be convenient here to explain the manner in which they are calculated.
5 The method adopted, which is a modification of that adopted by Major Christophers, is as follows:- Epidemic malaria of the nature now under consideration is entirely an autumnal phenomenon, usually exhibiting its greatest effect on the fever mor- tality during the month of October. The fever deaths for this month for the year under review are therefore calculated in the case of each municipal town, notified area and thana. The average monthly mortality from malaria for the months of April, May, June and July of the same year is then worked out for each area. These two figures are then cast in the form of a fraction of which the numerator is the October mortality and the denominator is the average fever mortality for the period mentioned above. Thus- Recorded Fever Mortality for October. Average monthly Fever Mortality for April, May, June and July    160 = - = 10 (epidemic figure).    16 In this manner the epidemic figure for each municipal town, notified area and rural circle (thana) may be worked out, and by placing these figures in their appropriate area on a map of the Province the distribution of the epide- mic becomes accurately known. Further by the use of different colours for epidemic figures of certain magnitudes it is possible to display in a graphic manner the relative degree of severity of the epidemic in different areas. When this is done for the year under review it is found that in many dis- tricts the epidemic figure does not exceed 1, indicating that the number of deaths in October 1913 did not exceed the normal number. Epidemic figures of from 1 to 5 may be considered to represent an increased mortality due to the normal autumnal recrudescence of the disease, and such being the case it is clear that autumnal malaria was even less prevalent than usual over a large part of the Punjab during 1913. In the districts of Gurgaon, Hissar and Rohtak, for example, where a partial failure of the monsoon was experienced, the epidemic figures were consistently low, being with few exceptions 1 or less. The only area in which the epidemic figure was 5 or more throughout the Province was the town of Eminabad in the Gujranwala District where the epidemic figure was 41/4 = 1025 E. F. The circumstances under which this isolated epidemic occurred have been investigated. It was found that the epidemic was not entirely con- fined to the town but affected to some extent a portion of the thana (Kamoke) in which it is situated, with the result that the epidemic figure of the latter was raised to 3.5 and the spleen-rate of children under 10 years of age to 47.7 per cent. It was also discovered that the severe epidemic in Eminabad coincided with the opening of a new canal in the vicinity and with the local cultivation during the period from June-October 1913 for the first time of rice crops. But in view of the fact that the rice fields are situated at a distance of more than half a mile from the town, that the epidemic did not affect all the areas supplied by the new canal, and that a similar epidemic of exactly equal severity, so far as mortality is concerned, occurred in 1908 (when no canal existed) there is reason to believe that the opening of the latter had little or no influence in producing the epidemic. On the other hand, the occurrence of local flooding as the result of defects in the drainage system which takes the rain-water from the Kashmir hills was thought to be of greater significance. The investigation of Eminabad exemplified in a striking manner the importance of calculating "epidemic figures," and it also demonstrated the
6 accuracy of the method adopted. Thus it was found that whilst the average fever mortality for the months of April-July 1913, was 4, the fever mortality for October 1912, when no epidemic occurred, was also exactly the same figure. In view of the absence in other areas of epidemic figures exceeding 5 it will not on this occasion be necessary to prepare a map to demonstrate its distribution and intensity. Finally, it may be said that the absence of epidemic malaria for some years has afforded a favourable opportunity for studying the conditions present during the inter-epidemic period and to contrast them with those found by Major Christophers as the result of his researches at the close of the 1908 epidemic. V.-Report on the work of the Punjab Malaria Bureau. Owing to the exigencies of the service the appointment of Chief Malaria Medical Officer changed hands three times during the year. From January 1st to April 4th Major E. L. Perry, I.M.S., held charge, from which date until October 6th Captain H. G. Stiles Webb, I.M.S., acted as Chief Malaria Medical Officer, whilst Captain C. A. Gill, I.M.S., held the appointment from October 6th to the end of the year. Observations were made in regard to the prevalence of malaria in a large number of towns and villages. In the district of Gurgaon a large area was roughly surveyed in the tahsils of Palwal and Nuh. Major Perry continued his observations in the Gujrat thana of Gujrat District which have yielded information of considerable value owing to the systematic manner in which they have been conducted during the past five years. Before his departure on leave Major Perry drew up a plan for future work for the department which was submitted to Government in the form of a note attached to his monthly diary for January. Major Perry was also called upon to advise in regard to the extensive schemes which have been inaugurated at Amritsar in order to mitigate the incidence of malaria in that city, but no detailed survey appears to have been carried out before the inception of these measures with the exception of Major Christophers' observations in 1909. A malaria survey of the city is, however, now being undertaken, but it cannot be completed until the local conditions have been studied during the rainy season. Captain Stiles Webb prepared malaria surveys of the towns of Palwal, Hansi and Kaithal, and his reports and recommendations were submitted to Government in due course. He also conducted some observations in regard to the value of larvacidal fish. The local conditions in regard to malaria in the towns of Montgomery and Lyallpur were also examined, and towards the close of the year malaria surveys of Amritsar, Gujrat and Batala were commenced. Numerous observations in- regard to the habits and local prevalence of the different species of anophelines in Lahore, Amritsar and many other places were made and some thousands of these insects were dissected in order to discover the local "carriers" of malaria. An Assistant Surgeon was deputed to carry out certain experiments in the Lahore jails in regard to the relative value of different methods of adminis- tering quinine sulphate to prisoners. He was also required in conjunction with this experiment, to report on the value of two native drugs-Harmine and Harmaline-in the treatment of malaria. The latter experiment was stopped at the end of October, and it is not considered expedient to express any opinion in regard to this subject, more especially as Captain Husband, I.M.S., who was chiefly responsible for the ex- periment, will, it is understood, submit a report in due course. In regard to the
7 quinine experiment the value of the observations appear to have been materi- ally reduced owing to the fact that an effort was made to carry out two experi- ments at the same time. But it is not to be anticipated that scientific result of value will be achiev- ed by the deputation of young Assistant Surgeons without special training and qualifications for such duties. The quinine experiment, therefore, which had been temporarily stopped early in October has not been recommenced. Malaria classes for Assistant Surgeons and Sub-Assistant Surgeons were held three times during the year-in January, April and August. Each class lasted six weeks, and altogether 12 Assistant Surgeons and 7 Sub-Assistant Surgeons were trained in the diagnosis of mosquitoes and in the method of conducting malaria surveys. The staff of the department consisted of two Assistant Surgeons (one of whom was on quinine duty for 9 months) two Sub-Assistant Surgeons and two Compounders. A third Assistant Surgeon has been entertained since October 4th. Whilst therefore the staff is sufficient to meet present requirements it is important that only young and active men should be posted to the department and, that, in view of the special nature of their duties, those who exhibit an aptitude for the work should not be subject to transfer. VI.-Anti-malarial measures. But this brief summary of the work of the department would be income- plete without reference to the efforts that are being made to develope the poten- tialities of the provincial organization for the study of malaria. The para- mount importance of malaria in the Punjab will probably be conceded by all, but there is reason to believe that the same unanimity does not exist in regard to the practicability of reducing materially its prevalence within a reasonable period of time. The area involved seems so large, the disease so widespread and above all the local conditions often so difficult that many believe that its total eradiction can never be anything more than a pious hope. But a frank recognition of the gravity of the problem and of the diffi- culties that must be surmounted before success can be achieved is in itself a step forward. Moreover, a study of epidemic malaria in the Punjab supports the conclusion not only that no grounds for undue pessimism exists, but, on the contrary, that practical results of considerable magnitude may be attained within a comparatively short time. It is, however, necessary to realise clearly that although great progress has been made, more especially in the last decade, in our knowledge of the con- ditions favouring the incidence of malaria, finality on this subject has not yet been achieved. Indeed almost every malaria survey that is made emphasises the need for the further study of the disease under different local conditions. In the Punjab, for example, epidemic or fulminant malaria is the outstand- ing feature requiring investigation. In these circumstances undue haste in regard to the attainment of "practical results" is to be deprecated, and more especially is this the case since practical anti-malarial measures on a large scale must still be considered to be in an experimental stage in India. It is therefore on many grounds expedient that attention should be directed towards the elucidation of those portions of the malaria problem which are at present little understood, but which may have an important bearing on the anti-malarial measures it will ultimately be necessary to adopt. It is not intended to imply that no preventive measures can at present be recom- mended, but it is merely desired, to emphasise the point that our knowledge of malaria has not yet reached the stage when malaria surveys can be drawn up with the precision and ease with which an engineer prepares plans and esti- mates for a bridge.
8 One of the most important anti-malarial measures at the present time in the Punjab is therefore the provision of facilities for further research, and it is held that there is no more useful method of applying a portion of the sum allot- ted for anti-malarial projects than in assisting the investigations on which these projects are founded. But although further investigation is necessary in regard to certain aspects of the malaria problem there are many useful anti-malarial measures- using the term in its widest sense-that may at once be adopted. It will be unnecessary to refer in detail to the nature of these measures as detailed proposals have been submitted to Government in regard to them. In conclusion it may be stated that grounds exist for the opinion that; given some years of systematic study of malaria both in individual localities and in the Province as a whole, the malaria problem in the Punjab may be tackled with a distinct prospect of success within a comparatively short period of years.
