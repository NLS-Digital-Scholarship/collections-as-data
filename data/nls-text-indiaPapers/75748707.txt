Out of the total sum due on account of cost of sera and vaccines, viz., Rs. 75,814-2-7 a sum of Rs. 44,126-4-11 was recovered and credited to Government leaving a balance of Rs. 31,687-13-8 outstanding on the 1st April 1941. The manufacture of Goat Tissue Virus at the Bihar Veterinary College Laboratory which is made available to the staff with more despatch and at a much cheaper rate than Rinderpest Serum hitherto obtained from the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar, has made its use on a much wider scale throughout the year possible. This has effected a considerable saving in the expenditure on sera and vaccines to the local bodies. VETERINARY INSTITUTIONS. 62. Veterinary Hospitals.17 64.

Out of the total quantity of 1,842 lbs. 1 oz. of butter 1,639 lbs. 15 ozs. were sold, 192 lbs. 9 ozs. made into ghee leaving a balance of 9 lbs. 9 ozs. at the end of the year. Out of the total quantity of 379,870 lbs. of Farm milk 359,534½ lbs. were sold, 8,323 lbs. were separated for cream and 3,835 lbs were lost in pasteurising, measuring and bottling and. the balance 8,177½ lbs. were fed to the calves.

Revenue and Expenditure.23 CHAPTER V. LABORATORIES. 88. During the year under report the Bihar Veterinary College Laboratory continued to examine slides and other materials received from the Government Cattle Farm, private individuals, as well as from the staff of the Central Range and the Chota. Nagpur Sub-Range, while those received from the staff of the North Bihar Range were examined at the laboratory at Muzaffarpur. Altogether 2,073 specimens, comprising of blood and pus smears, fæces, skin scrapings, urine and milk were examined at the College Laboratory, and 1,090 specimens at the North Bihar Range laboratory making a total of 3,163 as against 2,813 of the year 1939-40. The number includes 822 specimens received from the Central Range and 500 from the Chota Nagpur Sub-Range (previous figures being 861 and 259, respectively). In addition 23 interesting pathological specimens were preserved at the North Bihar Range Laboratory. Owing to rapid increase of work in the Sub-Range the present system of examination of slides, etc., of this Sub-Range at the College Laboratory is unsatisfactory. A proposal for the establishment of a small laboratory attached to the bub-Range office at Ranchi has, therefore, been submitted for the consideration of Government. (VETERINARY) DISEASE INVESTIGATION SCHEMES. 89. The programme of work of the (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer, Bihar as approved by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research included the following items :24 (c) Encephalitis.25 94. Miscellaneous.26 Sub-Range, and Babu R. K. Ram, temporary (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer, also retired from service during the year. The post of Lecturer of Anatomy at the Bihar Veterinary College was temporarily held by Mr. M. A. Rahim, a member of the Subordinate Veterinary Service. The post of Professor of Medicine and Physiology remained unfilled during the year. The proposal for filling up the vacant post of Assistant Director of the Department did not materialise. Owing to rapid expansion of work, want of such officers in ranges to relieve the Deputy Directors of their routine field and office works is keenly felt and in order to maintain efficiency it will be necessary to create one post of Assistant Director for the Central Range and revive the vacant post referred to above. SUBORDINATE. 97. Excluding the non-gazetted officers employed at the Bihar Veterinary College and the Government Cattle Farm the subordinate staff of the Department at the beginning of the year consisted of 155 officers. In the course of the year 1st grade veterinary inspector Babu D. C. Guha and senior grade II veterinary assistant surgeon Babu C. K. Mukherji retired from service while senior grade II veterinary assistant surgeon Maulavi M. H. Khan and 1st grade veterinary assistant surgeon Babu R. S. Prasad died. During the year Babus H. K. Roy and M. M. Banerji were promoted to 1st grade inspectorship and the resultant vacancies in the 2nd grade were filled by promoting Babus A K. Ghosh and I. B. Ghosh, Babu B. Prasad I, temporary 3rd grade veterinary inspector, reverted to his substantive post of veterinary assistant surgeon due to unsatisfactory work and staff veterinary assistant surgeon Maulavi S. M. A. Fazal acted in the vacancy thus caused till the 8th March 1941, when Babu N. D. Singh, who was officiating as 3rd grade veterinary inspector, was appointed to the post on probation. Maulavi A. U. Ahmed, who was officiating as 3rd grade veterinary inspector, was absorbed against a permanent vacancy while senior grade II veterinary assistant surgeons Babu P. K. Roy and Maulavi S. Mohammed were promoted to the inspector's grade against the vacancies caused by the retirement of the officers noted above and the reversion of the officiating veterinary inspector Babu S. D. Narain for unsatisfactory work. Staff veterinary assistant surgeon Babu R. D. Singh, veterinary assistant surgeons Babus D. Dey and S. B. Lal (later appointed staff veterinary assistant surgeon of the North Bihar Range), acted in leave and other vacancies caused by the temporary appointment of 3rd grade veterinary inspectors Babus B. L. Moitra and J. N. Mukherji as Assistant Investigation Officer (Poultry) and Lecturer of the Bihar Veterinary College, respectively. During the year two more vacan- cies of staff veterinary assistant surgeons in Central Range and Chota Nagpur Sub-Range were filled by 1st grade-veterinary assistant surgeons Babu D. Prasad and Maulavi M. S. Khan. Reserve veterinary assistant surgeon Maulavi Q. Khan was appointed to the temporary post of ins- pector in charge of the Goat Tissue Virus Scheme on reversion from his temporary appointment of Inspector at the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute. Nine Bihar Veterinary graduates were recruited to the
27 Subordinate Veterinary Service. At the close of the year the staff consisted of 158 officers as shown in Table X. 98. Professional examinations and training.28 1,242 cases of which 1,166 ended in conviction. In addition 10 cases of cattle poisoning and 12 cases of malicious injuries were also reported. During the year nine Veterinary Institutions including those maintained by the Bettiah Estate and Dumraon Raj were declared as Infirmaries under the Cruelty Act. For want of proper accommodation in certain infirmaries of the Province difficulty is being felt in housing cruelty cases. It is hoped the local bodies concerned will take early action in the matter and also consider the question of appointment of a trained dresser where such a post is necessary for receiving cruelty cases and also to give first aid to them during the absence on tour of the Touring Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. 102.

Patna, the 16th January 1942. READ2 The mortality among immunised cattle was 04 per cent only. Sera and vaccine of the value of Rs. 39,688-6-0 were purchased during the year. Dr. A. C. Choudhury, Professor of Hygiene, Dietetics and Animal Husbandry at the Veterinary College, supervised the work of the Cattle Breeding and Dairy Farm throughout the year. Babu M. M. Banarji was the Farm Manager up to 2nd September 1940 after which Mr. A. Rathore took his place. The Farm herd consisted of 593 animals. The total milk yield increased from 344,828 lbs. during the last year to 379,870 lbs. during the year under report. The total revenue of the Farm amounted to Rs. 70.487 against the expenditure of Rs. 76,633 excluding the payments made by the Public Works Department for repairs to buildings. The corresponding figures for the previous year were Rs. 70,818 and Rs. 83,791. It is satisfactory that the net difference between the income and the expenditure was only Rs. 6,146 as against Rs. 12,973 during the previous year. It is hoped that efforts will be con- tinued to make the Farm self-supporting at an early date. The total expenditure of the Department amounted to Rs. 6,75,751 against. Rs. 7,21,902 during 1939-40. The sum of Rs. 6,75,751 is made up of Rs. 4,14,552 which was met from the Provincial revenues, Rs. 6,049 contributed by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, and the balance from the local bodies. The decrease in expenditure is due to the retire- ment of an I. V. S. officer, the stoppage of the special pay for the officer-in-charge of the Cattle Farm and other economies effected. The total receipts of the Department were Rs. 2,18,871. The Provincial Government are pleased to note the names of the officers commended by the Director of Veterinary Services. Their thanks are due to Mr. M. 1. Malik for the efficient management of the Department and to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research for their contribution.
