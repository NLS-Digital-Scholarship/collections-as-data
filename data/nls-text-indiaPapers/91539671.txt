Officer in charge of the Depart- ment. THIS report deals with the triennial period 1896-97 to 1898-99. I was in charge of the Department throughout that period. 2. In the Metropolitan and Northern Bengal Circles there were no Deputy Sanitary Commissioners for the greater part of the years 1897-98 and 1898-99, and I had consequently to look after the current duties of their offices in addition to my own work. The Western Bengal Circle was for the most part in charge of an Assistant Surgeon. The department was thus worked under extraordinary disadvantages. Strength of staff. 3. The following table shows the strength of the vaccination establish- ment during the triennial period under review, as compared with each of the three corresponding previous years. YEARS.

Decrease of 95 paid vaccina- tors is due to the abolition of the Government paid agency in Angul and to a less number of paid vaccinators having been employed in Puri. In- crease in the number of licensed vaccinators needs no explanation. 1897-98 ... 1 1 3 ... 2 7 29 ... 5 ... 34 1896-97 ... 1 1 4 ... 2 8 29 ... 4 ... 33 1895-96 ... 1 1 5 ... 2 9 37 ... 4 ... 41 1894-95 ... 1 1 4 ... 2 8 30 ... 6 ... 36 1893-94 ... 1 1 4 ... 2 8 30 ... 4 ... 34 Calcutta Animal Vaccine Depôt. 1898-99 ... ... ... 1 ... 1 2 2 ... ... ... 2 1897-98 ... ... ... 1 ... 1 2 2 ... ... ... 2 1896-97 ... ... ... 1 ... 1 2 2 ... ... ... 2 1895-96 ... ... ... 1 ... 1 2 2 ... ... ... 2 1894-95 ... ... ... 2 ... 1 3 2 ... ... ... 2 1893-94 ... ... ... 2 ... 1 3 2 ... ... ... 2 C.S.&D.

The following statement shows, district by district, and in Calcutta, the Animal Vaccination Depôt, and municipalities separately, the total number of vaccinators, the total number of operations they performed, and the average per man during each of the three years under review, the average of the three years and the average of the previous three years for purposes of comparison: ( 3 ) DISTRICTS.

Aver- age of 1893( 4 ) It will be seen from this statement that the total number of operations performed in the province during the year 1898-99 was 2,147,452, against 2,293,655 and 2,319,536 during 1896-97 and 1897-98, respectively. This decrease is due chiefly to the plague inoculation scare and to the introduction of the six-puncture system of vaccination. The extra two points of vaccination were looked upon by the ignorant masses of the people as in some way con- nected with plague inoculation, and this retarded the progress of vaccination and accounts for the smaller number of operations performed during the past year. Notwithstanding this decrease, however, the average of the triennial period under review, shows, with an average of 184 additional vaccinators, an increase of 155,053 operations as compared with 1893-96. In rural areas, with an average increase of 220 vaccinators, there was an increase of 159,426 operations during the three years 1896-99 as compared with the previous three years 1893-96. In municipalities there was an average decrease of 32 vaccinators, but an increase of 9,232 operations during the period under review as compared with the previous triennial period. In Calcutta there was a decrease of four vaccinators and of 12,704 operations during the period under review, the larger number of vaccinations performed during the triennial period 1893-96 being due chiefly to the small-pox epidemic of 1894-95. In the Animal Vaccination Depôt, Calcutta, also, there was a decrease of 901 operations. Thirty-three out of the 49 districts (including the Tributary States of Orissa and the Political States of Chota Nagpur) show an increase of operations, which is satisfactory. The following 16 districts show a decrease:( 5 ) In 1898-99 it is said to be due to the occurrence of plague in the Munshi- ganj subdivision. Noakhali.( 6 ) Primary Vaccinations. DISTRICTS.

Average. of 1893( 7 ) It is satisfactory to notice that there was an increase of 130,006 primary vaccinations during the period under review, as compared with the previous triennial period. The ratio per cent. of successful cases shows a decrease of .37, being 97.92, against 98.29 of 1893-96. As explained in previous reports, this high ratio is due to the dishonest practice followed by the vaccinators of including in the returns partial and even absolute failures as successful cases. This can only be put a stop to by stricter supervision by the Civil Surgeons and the local inspecting staff. Protection afforded to infants . 6. The subjoined table shows in order of sequence, the degree of protection afforded to infants in the several districts of the province during the year 1898-99 as com- pared with 1895-96, the year previous to the triennial period under review:( 8 ) For the reason explained in the last triennial report, this table has been prepared for the last year of the period under review, and a column has been added for purposes of comparison, showing the proportion of persons success- fully vaccinated in 1895-96 per thousand of the surviving population under one year of age available for vaccination. It will be seen that with the exception of a few districts, the protection afforded to infants in 1898-99 was greater than it was three years ago. The noticeable feature of this return is the great variation which exists in the several districts regarding the degree of protection afforded to infants under one year. Whereas in Malda the number of infants successfully vaccinated per thousand was as large as 856, in Puri it was only 24. No doubt the pre- judice to infant vaccination which exists in many districts accounts to some extent for the difference as shown in this table, but I am inclined to think that, in some districts at least, the successful results are due to the interest and activity shown by the local officers in pushing on vaccination. I do not see any reason why, with persevering care and tact on the part of the local officers, the ratio of successful infant vaccination can not be much higher than it is at present.

( 10 ) It will be seen that in rural areas the average number of revaccinations rose from 7,321 during the three years 1893( 11 ) 9. The following table shows the number of operations performed during the recess, chiefly in connection with small-pox epidemics and the up-keep of lymph for emer- gencies:( 12 ) Licensed Agency.(13 ) AGE( 14 ) Cost of vaccination. 12. The subjoined table shows the cost of vaccination during each of thethree years under review, the average of three years, and the average of the previous three years; also the cost of each successful case :[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]
( 15 ) Diagram illustrating death-rate from small- pox, and degree of protection afforded. 14. In accordance with precedent I give the following diagrams illustrating the death-rates from small-pox in each district during each of the three years of the triennial period under review with side by side the proportion of population pro- tected against the disease by vaccination during the seven preceding years :[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]
( 16 ) 1891[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]
( 17 ) 1892( 19 ) It is difficult to arrive at any definite conclusions from these diagrams. I have, however, in accordance with the desire expressed in paragraph 10 of the Government Resolution on the last annual Vaccination Report, prepared the following statement showing the number of deaths from small-pox and ratio per mille of population in the districts of Champaran, Balasore, Saran, Muzaffar- pur and Darbhanga prior to and after the introduction of vaccination :( 20 ) The increase of work in both the depôts is satisfactory. The average quantity of lanoline vaccine paste supplied from the Calcutta and Darjeeling Animal Vaccination Depôts was 58,372 and 53,028 grains respectively, against 31,973 and 35,618 grains respectively of the previous triennial period. Supply of lanoline lymph to Nepal. 16. Seven hundred and sixty-five grains of lanoline vaccine paste and glycerinated calf lymph were supplied to the Nepal Darbar during the year 1898-99. It has been difficult to obtain returns showing the work done with the lymph supplied. The following result is tabulated from three returns received during the year :( 21 ) The increase is specially noticeable in the districts of Jessore and Bala- sore, and in the district of the Sonthal Parganas, where calf vaccination was practised for the first time, very satisfactory results were obtained through the personal exertion of the Civil Medical Officer, Dr. Kelly. The Civil Surgeons of these districts deserve credit for the successful results attained in them. No explanation has been furnished by the local officers of the marked decrease of operations in Backerguuge, Jalpaiguri and Cuttack. In Purnea 4,766 operations were performed direct from the calf in 1897-98, but in 1898-99 no calf was vaccinated in the. district. This is very unsatis- factory. The Civil Surgeon has been asked for an explanation in the matter. In some districts it is difficult to get calves on hire free of cost, and a small number of these animals can only be vaccinated in them. If Munici- palities and District Boards can be induced to make certain grants for this purpose, better results would follow. Inspections. 18. The inspections performed by Deputy Sanitary Commissioners, Civil Surgeons, Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors of Vaccina- tion are given below in order of sequence. It would be misleading to prepare a statement of this nature for three years on account of the frequent changes of officers. I have therefore shown only the inspections performed during the last year of the triennial period under review:( 22 ) Civil Surgeons( 23 ) Civil Surgeons( 24 ) number of villages and of operations shown to have been inspected by some Civil Surgeons was looked upon with suspicion by Government. On enquiry, this has been found to be due to the practice followed by them of inspecting the results of several villages on one spot. In accordance with the instructions of the Civil Surgeons of some districts the Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors of Vaccination collect the children of several villages at a particular place for their inspection. Hence the increase in the number of villages and of opera- tions shown as inspected by them. Inspectors. DISTRICT. Number of villages in his jurisdiction.

In their cases also this depends chiefly on the activity or negligence on the part of particular officers. The stimulus given to their work by Civil Surgeons also tends to increase the number of inspections. In the case of
( 26 ) Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors of Vaccination, inspection of less than 30 and 50 per cent. respectively of the operations in their jurisdiction is inexcusable. General remarks. 19. Although vaccination is making fair progress in Bengal, it must be admitted that there is still much opposition to it in many districts, particularly in Bihar, Puri and the Tributary States. In Puri specially, and in some of the Bihar districts, the people are generally averse to vaccination, and look upon inoculation with favour. In these places local influence and tact have not had the anticipated result of stamping out the long standing and deep rooted prejudices of an ignorant population. The only effective remedy in these backward districts, is, I am afraid, the introduction of the Compulsory Vaccination Act. Another great hindrance to the progress of vaccination is the difficulty experienced by the licensed vaccinators in some districts in realizing their fees. They naturally expect to get remuneration for their work, and when they find that large arrears of fees have accumulated, they leave work and move about exact- ing their dues which they are often unable to realize. Many trained good vaccinators have thus thrown up their appointments in disgust, and it has been difficult to replace them. Unless something is done to remove this difficulty, it will not be possible to attract good men into the service. The success of vaccination depends on the (1) appointment of trained men as vaccinators, (2) the supply of pure lymph, and (3) the supervision of the work of the operating staff. In Bengal the Civil Surgeon, who is the chief supervising officer, cannot be expected to devote much time to inspection of vaccination work, owing to his heavy and numerous duties at head-quarters. In the absence therefore of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners the important work of supervision, which exercises much influence in the minds of the people and the vaccination staff generally, has suffered considerably. The subordinate vaccination staff are generally men of poor education, and it is too much to expect them to exercise much influence on the people or on the vaccination staff. With these drawbacks to contend against, the progress of vaccination must be slow. I am also very strongly of opinion that something should be done to improve the disgracefully backward condition of vaccination in Puri and the Tributary States of Orissa and Chota Nagpur. From enquiries which I caused to be made on this subject, I have come to the conclusion that the best way of carrying on vaccination in Puri at present, is to appoint a certain number of paid trained Hindu vaccinators of high caste at the expense of the District Board. In previous years the District Board paid for vaccination, and the result was satisfactory. Considering the present condition of Puri, it is desir- able to revert to the paid system in that district at the expense of the District Board. In the Tributary States the vaccinators are worthless, ill-trained, low-caste men, who are discrediting the cause of vaccination. They should be replaced by trained operators. It has been suggested that a school for the training of vaccinators should be started at Cuttack from whence vacci- nators may be recruited for Orissa and the Tributary States. This proposal seems to me to be reasonable, and I commend it to the favourable consideration of Government. It is also necessary to increase the number of supervising officers in these States. For the purpose of effective supervision, it is desirable to appoint an officer of, at least, the Assistant Surgeon class to each of the Tributary States of Orissa and Chota Nagpur. I shall submit this proposal to Government in a separate communication if the Government are prepared to take up the matter. It has been stated in the opening paragraph of this report that the work of this Department has been carried on under extraordinary difficulties during the greater part of the past three years owing to the Department being deprived of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners. This not only handicapped the work in the districts, but increased it greatly at head-quarters, where the ordinary work of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner's offices had for the most part to be done by my office in addition to our own work. I am greatly indebted to Mr. A. A. Price, my Personal Assistant, for the assistance he has afforded me in carrying on the work of the Department with all his additional work, and also to Babu Bireswa Dé, the Head Clerk of the Vaccination Branch of the office, on whom most of the office work has fallen. The usual statistical returns are appended to this report. CALCUTTA, H. J. DYSON, F.R.C.S., Major, The 8th August 1899. Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal.

Operations.( 3 ) between the percentages of different districts which were commented on by Government in their Resolution last year. These differences range from a proportion of 856.55 per mille in Malda to one of 24.29 in Puri, and emphasise the conclusion drawn in the preceding paragraph that there is a very wide difference between the amount of attention given to vaccination in different districts. Of districts which have been previously noticed as exceptionally backward, the increase in Gaya from 39.72 to 227.07 is particularly noticeable, while Patna, which in 1895-96 was at the bottom of the list with 26.52, has risen to 85.72. The average in Puri is, however, the lowest on record, and the improvement in Shahabad is trifling. The backwardness of vaccination in Puri has attracted the special attention of the Sanitary Commissioner, and he has arrived at very radical conclusions which must be separately discussed. In the meantime the opening of a training school for vaccinators at Cuttack. should be undertaken as soon as possible, and the Commissioner will be asked to use his influence with the Chiefs of the Tributary States to entertain trained and respectable men. As regards the other backward districts of the Province, Sir John Woodburn would call the special attention of the Civil Surgeons concerned to the example of Gaya; and hopes that in the near future a more uniformly high average may be attained. It may be noted that in compiling this table an average birth rate of 40 per mille has been assumed. In the Sanitary Report the accepted estimate of 50 per mille has been taken as the basis of calculation throughout, and it would be as well for the sake of uniformity if that estimate were adopted for the future in the Vaccination Report also. 5. Primary operations.( 4 ) the unprotected would alone disturb any conclusion. For instance, the three consecutive districts of Jalpaiguri, Rungpore, and Bogra reached in the seven years ending 1899 almost precisely the same measure of protection, 180 per mille, but the ratio of deaths from small-pox in that period was 0.00 in Jalpaiguri; 0.13 in Rungpore; 1.01 in Bogra. The first district entirely escaped the epidemic among the unprotected majority, which was severe in the third, and more lightly felt in the second. In the five selected districts the result generally, except in Saran, has been the reduction of small-pox mortality by a half. It is quite possible that this reduction is more accidental than real, for in not one of the five districts is the ratio of protection among the population particularly high. But, after all, this is the real test by which the department must be eventually judged, its success in checking the mortality from small-pox. Every year increases the area of its protection ; every year increases the width of its statistics and the confidence with which inferences can be drawn from them; and in future at least, every triennial report should present an opportunity for a full and thorough examin- ation of facts for encouragement or instruction, as the case may be. A striking feature in the diagrams is the position of Puri and Cuttack( 5 ) ratio is in the majority of cases equalled or exceeded, while in only one district, Singhbhum, has inspection disclosed results considerably below it. In that district the proportion of successful cases to the number inspected by the Civil Surgeon, the Inspectors and the Sub-Inspectors was 87.72, 88.89, and 79.13, respectively. It would be interesting to know if this result is due to greater care and efficiency in inspection or to any special cause. The Lieutenant-Governor thanks Major Dyson for his work during the year. It was carried on at high pressure under many disadvantages, but there was notable improvement in some of the worst districts. It is on these that his attention must be concentrated, and the Lieutenant-Governor trusts that next winter he may be able, with a full staff of assistants, to advance this useful work still further.

I was in charge of the Department throughout the year, and had under me the follow- ing Deputy Sanitary Commissioners. In the Metropolitan Circle, Captain W. W. Clemesha, I.M.S., from 11th April 1899 to 17th January 1900, and Captain L. Rogers, I.M.S. from 18th January to 31st March 1900. In the Northern Bengal Circle, Captain W. D. Hayward, I.M.S., from 29th December 1899 to 31st March 1900. In the Western Bengal Circle, Assistant Surgeon Gopal Chandra Mukerjea throughout the year. There was no Deputy Sanitary Commissioner in the Metropolitan Circle from 1st to 10th April 1899 and in the Northern Bengal Circle from 1st April to 28th December 1899. I looked after the current duties of these offices during those periods in addition to my own work. Captain Clemesha was almost entirely engaged in plague work, and Captain Rogers in inspecting the sanitary condition of the riparian Munici- palities north of Calcutta, while Captain Hayward's time was occupied in superintending plague measures in and around Patna. These officers were consequently unable to inspect vaccination work. Strength of Staff. 3.

The number of deaths among infants in them has been calculated at the rate of infantile mortality obtaining in this Province during 1899, viz., 246.13 per mille. In accordance with the orders contained in paragraph 4 of the Government Resolution on the Triennial Report on vaccination for the three years 1896-97 to 1898-99, the estimated birth-rate has been calculated in the above table at the rate of 50 per mille instead of at 40 per mille, as was done in previous years. This has necessarily reduced the proportion of infants successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of the surviving population under one year available for vaccination during the year 1898-99 as compared with what was shown in the last year's report.
( 6 ) It will be seen from the statement that out of 3,076,043 which is the total surviving population under one year available for vaccination, 6,19,068 or 201.25 per mille was successfully vaccinated, against 5,02,300 or 156.85 per mille, during 1898-99. This increase is satisfactory and is noticeable in all the districts except Malda, Angul, Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Balasore, Faridpur, Singhbhum, Pabna and Cuttack. In the districts which head the list, viz., Darjeeling, Ranchi and Malda, etc., there is little opposition to vaccination, and infant vaccination is not much opposed, whereas in the districts at the bottom of the table, viz., Patna, Puri, Shahabad, Cuttack, etc., there is strong opposition to vaccination especially on infants under one year of age.

In accordance with Government orders Nos. 350S., dated the 25th January 1900 and 535 T.M., dated the 26th May 1900, the subjoined statement has been prepared showing the protection afforded to infants in each town in Bengal, during the year 1899-1900.

No satisfactory explana- tion of the decrease has been furnished by the local officers. Dinajpur shews the largest decrease viz., 11,997. This is attributed by the Civil Surgeon to the unwillingness of the people to resort to re-vaccination. The percentage of success was also less than that of the previous year by 12.51 in rural areas.

( 16 ) Diagram illustrating death-rate from small- pox, and degree of protection afforded. 15. The following diagram illustrates the death-rates from small-pox in each district with side by side the proportion of population protected against the disease by vaccination during the past seven years :( 17 ) Animal Vaccine Depôts. 16. The following table shows the amount of work done at the two Animal Vaccination Depôts during the year under review as compared with the previous year:( 18 ) It will be seen that the total number of primary vaccinations performed direct from the calf during the year under report shows an increase of over 35,000 operations as compared with the previous year. There was, however, a decrease of over 11,000 operations in re-vaccination. The increase is most striking in the districts of Midnapore, Murshidabad, Mymensingh and Sonthal Parganas, while there was a corresponding decrease in the districts of Jessore, Khulna, Rajshahi, Backergunge, Cuttack, Ranchi, and Palamau. In some districts, the difficulty in procuring calves is ascribed as a cause of the slow progress in calf-vaccination. There is no doubt, as stated in my last report, that more satisfactory results would follow if some grants were made for this purpose by Municipalities and District Boards. Supply of lymph to Nipal Dur- bar and Sikkim State. 18. Seven hundred and seventy-six grains of lanoline vaccine paste and glycerinated calf vaccine lymph were supplied to the Nipal Durbar, a supply being issued for the vaccination of the Royal family and another for the vaccination of the family of the Commander-in-Chief, Nipal Forces. Four hundred and five grains of lymph were also supplied to the Sikkim State, where vaccinations was vigorously carried on for the first time by the Medical Officer in charge during the recent epidemic of small-pox there. Only one return was received from the Prime Minister of Nipal during the year showing 70 successful vaccinations and 9 failures which were re-vaccina- tions. The Medical Officer, Sikkim State, reported that the lymph supplied from the Darjeeling Animal Vaccine Depôt was eminently successful. Inspections. 19.

( 20 ) Civil Surgeons( 21 ) It will be seen that Bankura, Backergunge and Champaran which stood very low in the list last year have now come up first, third and fourth respec- tively, and Muzaffarpur which went down to nineteenth has again occupied the second place in the list. Five Civil Surgeons inspected more than 10,000 operations against two of last year, while 9 against 7 inspected from 5,000 to 10,000. As remarked in last year's report, the variation in the number of inspections in any particular district, from year to year depends on the energy or inactivity shown by individual officers.

Three Inspectors against one of the previous year, inspected between 40,000 to 50,000, four against five between 30,000 to 40,000, ten against 13 between 20,000 to 30,000, and 19 against 17 between 10,000 to 20,000 operations:(23) Dacca and Mymensingh, which stood first and second last year, have exchanged places this year. Seven districts against five of the previous year show more than 50,000 operations inspected, while with very few exceptions, more than 50 per cent. of the operations performed were inspected by these officers. 20.

MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. SANITATION. DARJEELING, THE 11TH SEPTEMBER 1900. RESOLUTION( 2 ) These results reflect credit on the officers concerned. A larger number of operations than in the previous year was also performed in Calcutta and in mufassal municipalities and dispensaries. Twenty-one districts show a falling off, the decline being most marked in the following:( 3 ) 7. Recess work.( 4 ) in very few cases below the prescribed standard of 30 and 50 per cent., respectively. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, E. N. BAKER, Secretary to the Govt. of Bengal.

ANNUAL STATISTICAL RETURNS AND SHORT NOTES ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL FOR THE YEAR 1900-1901. BY MAJOR H. J. DYSON, I.M.S., F.R.C.S., Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal. Calcutta: PRINTED AT THE BENGAL SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1901.
Published at the BENGAL SECRETARIAT BOOK DEPÔT, Writers' Buildings, Calcutta. OFFICIAL AGENTS. In IndiaSHORT NOTES ON VACCINATION FOR THE YEAR 1900-1901. THE following are brief notes on vaccination in Bengal for the year 1900-1901, prepared in accordance with the recent orders of the Government of India regarding the curtailment of annual reports and returns. Officer in charge of the Depart- ment. 2. I was in charge of the Department throughout the year, and had under me the follow- ing Deputy Sanitary Commissioners: ( 2 ) In the districts of Patna, Gaya, and Saran the decrease is attributed by the Civil Surgeons to the prevalence of plague, while in the other districts named, except Puri, it is said to be due either to the unusual floods of September 1900 or to the prevalence of malarial fever and cholera. In Puri it is attributed to the employment of a much smaller number of vaccinators by the District Board, which cannot afford to provide more free vaccination than they do, and to the very great difficulty experienced in getting licensed vaccinators owing to the extreme difficulty in realizing fees. The average number of operations per man in rural areas was 944, against 593 of the previous year. The increase is due to the exclusion, in accordance with Bengal Government orders Nos. 1315S. and 1665S., dated, respectively, the 29th March and 19th April 1901, of apprentices in calculating the average. In Calcutta and mufassal municipalities, dispensaries, etc., the average was 1,494 and 602, against 850 and 460, respectively, of 1899-1900. This increase of work is satisfactory. Primary vaccination. 5. The total number of primary vaccinations performed in Bengalduring 1900-1901 was 2,227,942, against 2,203,984 of 1899-1900. Out of this number, 2,116,342 were done in rural areas, 16,783 in Calcutta, including the operations done in the Animal Vaccination Depôt, and 94,817 in mufassal municipalities and dispensaries, against 2,100,121, 15,214, and 88,649, respectively, of 1899-1900. There was thus a slight improvement in all the areas concerned. The ratio per cent. of success was 97.75, against 97.67 of the preceding year. In the three areas named, the rate of success was 97.87, 95.07, and 95.58, respectively. Protection afforded to infants. 6. During the year under review, out of 3,117,036, the estimated numberof infants under one year available for vaccination, 589,376 were successfully vaccinated. The pro- portion of infants successfully vaccinated per thousand of the surviving infant population available for vaccination during the year was 189.08, against 201.25 in 1899-1900 and 156.85 in 1898-99. The greatest protection was afforded in the districts of Darjeeling (704), Malda (550), Ranchi (543), Khulna (449), and Bhagalpur (444) per mille of infant population. The districts of Howrah, Balasore, the Tributary States of Orissa, Hooghly, Bogra, Faridpur, Birbhum, Patna, Muzaffarpur, Cuttack, Shahabad, and Puri show the least amount of protection, the number of infants successfully vaccinated in these districts having been below 100 per mille of the population. The protection afforded to infants in municipalities is shown in Statement No. VII, appended to the report. It will be seen that in most municipalities there was a marked improvement as compared with the previous year. Last year, I impressed upon Civil Surgeons the necessity of protecting the infant population in municipal areas, where the Compulsory Vaccination Act was in force, and the result shows that greater attention has been paid to this important matter. The attention of the Civil Surgeons of the districts where the result is still unsatisfactory will again be invited to the deficiency. 7. Revaccination.( 3 ) 10. Factory and Tea-garden Vaccination.( 4 ) Diagram illustrating death-rate from small- pox, and degree of protection afforded. 13. The following diagram illustrates the death-rates from small-pox in each district with side by side the proportion of population protected against the disease by vaccination during the past seven years :( 5 ) Deaths from small-pox. 14. The total number of deaths from small-pox during the year was25,302, against 14,514 of the preceding year. The largest number of deaths was recorded in the districts of Cuttack (7,081), Calcutta (2,240), Midnapore (2,071), Puri (1,746), Gaya (1,181), and Palamau (1,080), whereas in the districts of Tippera, Malda, Birbhum, Chittagong, Khulna, Dinajpur, and Murshidabad the mortality was lowest, viz., 6, 7, 17, 18, 20, 23, and 28, respectively. In Calcutta 476 cases of small-pox were admitted into the Campbell Hospital, of which 124 were vaccinated, 4 inoculated, and 348 unprotected. The ratio per cent. of deaths among each class of admissions was 9.67, 25, and 58.62, respectively. Animal Vaccination Depôts. 15. In the Animal Vaccination Depôts in Calcutta and Darjeeling 452and 169 calves were vaccinated, against 411 and 173, respectively, of the previous year. The amount of lanoline paste, in grains, manufactured was 65,832 and 50,329, respectively, against 58,800 and 49,538 of 1899-1900. The quantity of lymph which the two animal vaccination depôts are capable of supplying is quite insufficient to meet the increased needs of the Province. In many districts the arm-to-arm method of vaccination is being gradually superseded by vaccination direct from the calf or from lanoline lymph manufactured in the Calcutta and Darjeeling Depôts. The result is a growing demand for lymph, which the depôts cannot meet, and vaccination work consequently suffers. There should be at least two more depôts. One will shortly be established at Pusa, and, I think, there should be another in Orissa for the supply of lymph to the districts of the Orissa Division and the Political States of Orissa and Chota Nagpur, where vaccination is backward. Different methods of vaccination. 16. During the year under review 280,502 primary vaccinations wereperformed with calf lymph, 220,347 with lanoline lymph, and 1,727,093 by the arm-to-arm process. The ratio per cent. of success under each of these methods of vaccination was 98.46, 94.54, and 98.04, respectively. Thirty-two thousand five hundred and fifty-six, 44,617, and 41,196 revaccinations were also performed under each of the above three processes of vaccination with a success of 61.10, 51.66, and 65.91 per cent., respectively. Supply of lymph to the Nepal Darbar and Sikkim State. 17. Four hundred and forty grains of lymph were supplied from theAnimal Vaccination Depôt, Darjeeling, to the Nepal Darbar, which is reported to have produced excel- lent results. Two thousand four hundred andfifty-eight grains of lymph were also supplied from the same depôt to theSikkim State. 18. Inspections.STATISTICAL RETURNS. a

RESOLUTION( 2 ) per thousand of the population were successfully vaccinated. The figures of the Patna district are even more unsatisfactory, and there is hardly a single district of which the returns do not require some explanation. In previous reviews of the vaccination report, the Lieutenant-Governor has noticed the extraordinary discrepancies between the returns of different districts, especially in the matter of infant protection, and he has more than once asked the co-operation of the Sanitary Commissioner and District Officers with a view to obtain better and clearer results. Similar discrepancies are, however, still noticeable, and the Lieutenant-Governor must, therefore, insist upon District Magistrates and Civil Surgeons now in each district undertaking an examination of the lines of figures relating to their own jurisdictions in the manner indicated above. To these officers every figure in the returns should have a real meaning, and they should not let the matter drop until they have ascertained its meaning; and the result of their examination should be reported to the Sanitary Commissioner, who will then be in the position to advise Government as to the necessity of any alteration in the system generally or in particular districts, and also as to the desirability of any change in the forms of returns by which the work is judged. The whole question of the relative advantages and disadvantages of paid and licensed vaccinators is now under the consideration of this Government and the Sanitary Commissioner on a reference from the Government of India. 5. In view of the orders in the preceding paragraph, the Lieutenant- Governor abstains this year from further comment on the figures in the statistical statements and notes, although in some cases they are clearly incorrect, and for the same reason he has not thought it necessary to have the percentages calculated again on the populations according to the recent census. In the figures of vaccinated children given above, all under six years have been shown in order to avoid any material error from an erroneous classification of children below one year and above one year. 6. Owing to the difficulty experienced by licensed vaccinators in recovering their fees, a printed form of receipt was introduced last year experimentally in certain districts. The Sanitary Commissioner has recently reported that the experiment has been a success, and the form will now be introduced generally. The difficulty mentioned in paragraph 15 of the Sanitary Commissioner's notes in connection with the increasing demand for lymph will, it is hoped, be met by the principal dep6t being relieved of the work of supplying vaccinated calves and lymph to the Calcutta Municipality, the work being undertaken by the Health Officer to the Corporation.

FOR THE YEARS 1899-1900, 1900-1901 AND 1901-1902. Officer in charge of the Depart- ment. THIS report deals with the triennial period 1899-1900 to 1901-1902. Iwas in charge of the Department throughout that period. 2. In the Metropolitan Circle, there was no Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioner from 1st to 10th April 1899, from 17th August to 19th September 1900 and from 23rd May to 30th September 1901. The Northern Bengal Circle was without a Deputy Sanitary Commissioner from 1st April to 28th December 1899, from 13th August 1900 to 31st March 1901, and again from 1st April to 2nd October 1901, and the Western Bengal Circle was, for the most part, in charge of an Assistant Surgeon. I was in charge of the current work of the offices of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners, Metropolitan and Northern Bengal Circles, during the periods these appointments were vacant. The Department had, therefore, to work under very great disadvantages, specially as the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners of these Circles were for the most part employed on plague or other special work, and could not, therefore, do much vaccination inspection work. Strength of Staff. 3. In Calcutta the average number of Inspecting officers and operatorswas 8 and 31 respectively, against 9 and 35 of 1896-99. In Provincial rural areas and mufassal municipalities and dispensaries, &c., the inspecting staff and operators, including apprentices, numbered 247 and 3,465, and 10, and 236, respectively, against 249 and 3,437, and 10, and 246, respectively, of the previous triennial period. Number of operations performed, and average per man. 4. During the past year, the total number of operations performed inrural areas, mufassal municipalities, and dispen- saries, &c., and Calcutta, including the Animal Vaccine Depôt, was 2,492,611, 145,661, and 24,554, respectively, as compared with 2,158,565, 144,420, and 43,326, res- pectively, of 1900-1901, and 2,113,447, 112,718 and 26,356, respectively, of 1899-1900. The average of the triennial period in the above areas was 2,254,874, 134,266, and 31,412, respectively, against 2,115,357, 119,037, and 19,153, respectively, of 1896-99, and 1,955,931, 109,805, and 32,758, respect- ively of 1893-96. There was thus an increase of 139,517, and 15,229 operations, respectively, in rural areas and mufassal municipalities and dispen- saries, &c., as compared with 1896( 2 ) apprentice vaccinators were taken into account in calculating the average, whereas in the Vaccination Report of 1900-1901, they were excluded from the calculation, their work having been shown as that of the vaccinators to whom they were attached, and in the figures of 1901-1902 the work of the regular vaccinators only has been taken into account in calculating the average work done by them. I am, however, led to believe from the reports of the Civil Surgeons, that in most districts the average work of a vaccinator is greater than that of previous years. This is, I believe, due to the Government Resolution on the Vaccination Report of 1900-1901, which stirred up Civil Surgeons and Magis- trates to greater activity in the matter of vaccination, with the result that almost all the districts of the Province have reported a larger number of operations as compared with the previous year, which is an unprecedented event. The increase is most striking in the districts of Midnapore, 35,927 24-Parganas, 33,177, Mymensingh, 43,215, Faridpur, 23,720, Backergunge, 25,766, Patna, 20,110, and Gaya, 15,953. Only 4 districts, viz., Nadia, Bogra, Dacca, and Ranchi show a decrease of 1,104, 4,072, 11,934 and 4,894 operations, as compared with 1900-1901. The explanation of decrease furnished by the Civil Surgeons is as follows:( 3 ) the low rate of infant vaccination in this Province is aptly described by Major Crawford, I.M.S., Civil Surgeon of Hooghly, and, as his views correspond with those of many other Civil Surgeons, I quote below from his report( 4 ) double that of 1900-1901 and this was due to the greater prevalence of small- pox during the year in question. The average of the triennial period under review was 144,244 against 113,601 of 1896-99. Six-puncture vaccination. 9. During 1901-1902, 613,849 successful primary operations were per- formed in six points against 552,867 of 1900-1901 and 481,579 of 1899-1900. The figures for re-vacci- nation are 18,959 against 9,177 of 1900-1901 and 5,813 of 1899-1900. This shows that this method of vaccination is being gradually appreciated by the people. Factory and Tea-Garden vac- cination. 10. The total number of primary and re-vaccinations performed in Bengalin factories and tea-gardens, during the past year, 1901-1902, was 7,624 and 1,497 respectively, against 6,332 and 1,225, respectively of the previous year.The rate of success was 97.37 and 50.90 against 94.82 and 42.69 respectivelyof 1900-1901.

( 6 ) 1894[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]
( 7 ) 1895( 8 ) Deaths from small-pox. 14. The total number of deaths from small-pox in the Province duringthe past year was 48,207 against 25,302 of the preceding year, and 14,514 of 1899-1900. The ratios of deaths per 10,000 of the population was 6.21 against 3.4 of 1900-1901 and 1.9 of 1899-1900. The largest number of deaths was recorded in the districts of Midnapore (13,458), Cuttack (6,291), Mymensingh (3,175), Balasore (2,148), Patna (1,977), Singhbhum (1,680), Rangpur (1,643), 24-Parganas (1,519), Gaya (1,476), Bankura (1,356), Puri (1,078) and Palamau (995), where- as in the Districts of Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi and Darjeeling, the mortality was lowest, viz., 25, 38, 41 and 73 respectively. During the past year there was a general and widespread prevalence of small-pox in most parts of the Province. In the majority of cases, the disease is said to have been imported from Calcutta and to have spread among the unprotected population. Re-vaccination being carried on to a limited extent and a portion of the com- munity remaining unprotected, vide remarks in paragraph 19 below, it is no wonder that on the outbreak of a severe epidemic of small-pox, the mortality is high. Prompt measures were taken by Civil Surgeons to arrest the progress of the disease by vigorously pushing on vaccination in the affected localities. Animal Vaccination Depôts. 15. In the Animal Vaccination Depôts at Calcutta and Darjeeling theaverage number of calves vaccinated was 427 and 194 respectively, against 375 and 160 respectively, of the previous triennial period. The average quantity of lanoline paste in grains manufactured was 66,319 and 53,903 respectively, against 58,372 and 53,028 respectively, of 1896-99. The lymph supplied from the Calcutta Animal Vaccination Depôt was specially reported to be of very good quality. I beg to draw the attention of Government to the remarks made in my notes on vaccination for the year 1900-1901 regarding the inadequacy of the present supply of lymph which is seriously interfering with the work of vacci- nation in many parts of the Province. The Government sanctioned the establishment of an Animal Vaccination Depôt at Pusa in the district of Darbhanga in April 1901, but nothing has yet been done to start it. I would impress upon Government the necessity of establishing this institution at once and of sanctioning the erection of another in Orissa. Different methods of Vaccination. 16. During the past year, 1901-1902, 323,884 primary vaccinations wereperformed with lymph taken direct from the calf, 244,244 with lanoline lymph and 1,961,650 by the arm to arm process against 280,502, 220,347 and 1,727,093, respectively, of the previous year. The ratio per cent. of success under each of these methods of vaccination was 98.56, 96.07 and 98.16, respectively, against 98.46, 94.54, and 98.04, respectively, of 1900-1901. The number of re-vaccinations under each of these processes of vaccination was 35,134, 34,021 and 63.893 with a success of 75.74, 54.79 and 68.83 per cent. respectively against 32,556, 44,617 and 41,196 with a success of 61.10, 51.66 and 65.91 per cent. respectively, of the previous year. Supply of lymph to the Nepal Darbar and Sikkim and Bhutan. 17. Six hundred and seventy-five grains of vaccine lymph were suppliedfrom the Animal Vaccination Depôt, Darjeeling, to the Nepal Darbar. Only one return of vaccination was received and the operations performed there were all successful. Five hundred and sixty grains of lymph were supplied from the same Dep6t to the Sikkim State to suppress small-pox, which was raging in some parts of the State. Fifty grains of lanoline paste have been supplied to the Commissioner of the Rajshahi Division for vaccination in Bhutan. Inspections. 18. During the past year, the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners of theMetropolitan and Eastern Bengal, Northern Bengal and Western Bengal Circles inspected each 115, 30,048, and 8,955 cases, respectively. The short amount of inspection performed by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Metropolitan and Eastern Bengal Circle, was due to his being employed chiefly on Sanitary Inspection duty. Among Civil Surgeons, 4, viz., Bankura, Pabna, Muzaffarpur and Balasore inspected more than 10,000 operations against 3 of the previous year; while 16 against 17 inspected from 5,000 to 10,000 cases; 21 against 14 inspected
( 9 ) between 2,000 and 5,000, and none inspected less than 1,000 cases against 5 of the previous year. The Civil Surgeons of the first named districts deserve credit for the inspection work performed by them. The attention of the Civil Surgeons who performed an inadequate amount of inspections will again be drawn to the matter. Of the subordinate inspecting staff 12 District Inspectors of Vaccination against 13 of the previous year, inspected more than 50 per cent of the oper- ations in their jurisdiction; 14 between 40 and 50 per cent; 17 between 20 and 40, and 6 below 20 per cent against 7, 24, and 4 respectively of the previous year. In 8 districts, the Sub-Inspectors of Vaccination inspected more than 80 per cent of the operations under their charge against 9 of the previous year; in 32 districts between 50 and 80 per cent. and in 8 districts only below 50 per cent. The subordinate inspecting officers whose inspection work was unsatisfactory, have been warned. General remarks. 19. I beg to draw the attention of Government to the remarks which Imade in paragraph 19 of my last triennial report re- garding the state of vaccination in this province. The state of things therein described still continues. There is the same opposi- tion to vaccination in Bihar, the districts of the Orissa Division and in the Tributary States as it was three years ago. In fact there is scarcely any district in Bengal where there is not some opposition in some form or other. Infant vaccination is very unpopular in most parts of the Province. Parents hide their children from the vaccinators in the belief that the operation would cause them pain and lead to suffering and disease. In fact deaths from other causes months after children are vaccinated are attributed to vaccination. At present the Vaccination Department has to work under great disadvantages. The vaccinators are not Government servants and as such are not recognized by the people and are looked upon with disfavour. They depend for their living on the fees which they get from the people, but which, unfortunately, they cannot realize in many cases. They have not got any proper remedy, as there is no special law in force compelling the payment of these fees, and they have, therefore, to depend on the good graces of the village panchayets or the police in the matter, but the people have come to know that the only course left to the vaccina- tor to realize his fees is by instituting a civil suit which they very well know he will not care to do for the worry and expense of. it, and they thus easily evade payment. The result is that many trained, good vaccinators, throw up their appointment in disgust and take to some other occupation for a living. It is difficult to replace them as there is not competition for the work and it is natural that this should be the case under existing circumstances. Those that stick to the occupation, work in areas where fees are easily obtained, leaving others to do so where there is opposition to vaccination or the people are reluctant to pay fees. The consequence is that many places are left unprotected and on the out-break of small-pox, it usually plays havoc with the people, as was the case in the past year. The subordinate inspecting staff are not much better off. They are recruited from the vaccination staff, and are an ignorant lot of men, who cannot be expected to exercise any great influence on the people, on which alone, under the present optional system, the success of vaccination depends. They have no distinct badge or uniform and move about like ordinary persons without carrying much weight with, or respect from, the people. The Sanitary Commissioner has to look to the superior supervising officers of the Depart- ment, viz., the Civil Surgeons and the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners for real help. The former, &quot;however, cannot devote much time to vaccination inspection, owing to their heavy and numerous duties at head-quarters, and the latter are required to visit the outlying parts of the Province which the former cannot inspect. But unfortunately during a considerable portion of the triennial period under report, I have had to work without deputies in some of the circles, and one circle (Western Bengal Circle) was in charge of an Assistant Surgeon. The covenanted officers were also employed in plague and other work and could not do much vaccination inspection. The frequent change of these officers also retarded work. To be of real help to the Department, a Sanitary and Vaccination Officer of the position of a Deputy Sanitary Commissioner
( 10 ) must remain in his post for years, in order that he may get sufficient ex- perience of the people and their ways and then suggest and carry out measures of improvement. With such serious disadvantages and adverse circumstances to contend against, the progress of vaccination in Bengal must be slow and gradual. Notwithstanding this, and the appearance of plagne in the Province, which hampered the progress of work in many districts, I have had the satisfaction of recording substantial progress as compared with the work of the previous triennial period and its predecessor, as will appear from the figures given in this report. The remedy for the evils described above lies, I think, in the temporary introduction of the Compulsory Vaccination Act in refractory areas, the appointment of paid Government vaccinators and a superior class of men as Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors of vaccination, and the more extended supply of good calf lymph. I would suggest the temporary introduction of the com- pulsory measure on the recommendation of the Civil Surgeon, the District Magistrate and the Divisional Commissioner in refractory areas till the people of such places take vaccination and re-vaccination, and are thoroughly protected. This measure, if adopted, would, I think, have a beneficial effect on other oppos- ing centres and the opposition to vaccination, will, it is hoped, die out under its influence from the Province. A proposal is under consideration to replace the licensed vaccinators of this Province by Government paid vaccinators and to reduce the number of the subordinate inspecting staff, on the basis of the arrangement in force in the Panjab and in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. Captain Clemesha, I.M.S., Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Northern Bengal Circle, has asked for permission to visit the United Provinces and the Punjab for the purpose, and then to submit a report of his experience of the working of the system in those Provinces. I have already addressed Govern- ment on this subject in a separate communication. In my last triennial report, I suggested the establishment of a training school for vaccinators at Cuttack and the appointment of superior supervising officers for the Tributary States of Orissa and Chota Nagpur. I am glad to report that the school has since been started and passed out some vaccinators, and that an officer, of the Assistant Surgeon class, was appointed as super- visor of vaccination for the Chota Nagpur States at their own cost. It is hoped that the Chiefs of the Orissa States will follow the example of the Chota Nagpur Chiefs, and appoint a superior supervising officer of vaccination for their States. It is reported that inoculation is very prevalent in Orissa and that the punishment given to the offenders is inadequate and has not had the desired effect of deterring people from the practice. Many of the cases are said to be tried by Honorary Magistrates, who inflict trivial fines. It is suggested that these cases be tried by Subdivisional Magistrates, and that exemplary punishment be meted out to the offenders. 20.

MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. SANITATION. CALCUTTA, THE 30TH JULY 1902. RESOLUTION( 2 ) estimated figures of the year, viz., 38.57. The latter should be adopted in future. These show that 32.06 per cent. of the infant population was pro- tected. This falls considerably below the average of other Provinces, which according to latest estimates is 45.52, and the question why results should be so indifferent in some districts is not satisfactorily answered. There may be defective classification of ages or greater willingness to bring forward children in some localities than in others, but the effect of these causes should be more closely examined. In Darbhanga 41 per cent. of the infants were vaccinated during the last year against an average of 7.4 per cent. in the years 1896( 3 ) 9. The standard of inspection work, both that done by Civil Surgeons and the subordinate inspecting staff, shows a general improvement, but the work done by the Civil Surgeons is very unequal. In Midnapore, where there was a severe outbreak of small-pox, the work of the District Inspector was very defective. There was also a failure in the Sonthal Parganas. Explana- tions should be submitted. The work done by the Deputy Sanitary Com- missioner of the Metropolitan and Eastern Bengal Circle, who inspected only 115 cases, was altogether insufficient. 10. In paragraph 19 of his report the Sanitary Commissioner comments upon the disadvantages under which the Vaccination Department labours in Bengal. The Lieutenant-Governor is disposed to think that the Sanitary Com- missioner has exaggerated the unpopularity of vaccination, and adheres to the opinion which he expressed in the Resolution on the report for the last triennium that its advantages are fairly recognized by the people of Bengal, and that such opposition as is encountered is based on a reluctance to pay the fees demanded by the licensed vaccinators. This subject will be more fully examined when the report on the proposal to substitute paid for licensed vaccinators is received. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, E. W. COLLIN, Offg. Secretary to the Govt. of Bengal. Circular No. 138. COPY, with a copy of the Report, forwarded to all Commissioners of Divisions for information. Their attention is specially drawn to the remarks contained in paragraph 5 of the Resolution and to Statement VII appended to the Report, from which it will be seen that in certain towns less than 50 per cent. of the infants were vaccinated, although the Vaccination Act is in force in them. It is requested that the District Officers may be called upon to explain the causes of the small outturn of work in the case of those towns, and that this explanation may be submitted for the information of Government. No. 1963S. COPY, with copy of the above circular, forwarded to the Sanitary Commis- sioner for information. His attention is specially drawn to the remarks contained in paragraphs 5 and 8 of the Resolution on which a further report is requested. No. 1964S. COPY, with a copy of the Report, forwarded to the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Bengal, for information. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, H. C.

The following are brief notes on vaccination in Bengal for the year 1902-1903. Officer in charge of the De- partment. 2. Major H. J. Dyson, I.M.S., was in charge of the Department from 1st April to 30th June, 1902; Captain W. W. Clemesha, I.M.S., from 1st July to 3rd August 1902; Captain B. H. Deare, I.M.S., from 4th August 1902 to 10th March 1903, and I from 11th to 31st March 1903. The follow- ing officers served as Deputy Sanitary Commissioners:(2) The principal decrease occurred in the following districts:[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]
(3) In mufassal municipalities, dispensaries, &c., 132,831 operations were performed against 145,661 of 1901-1902. There was a decrease of 12,830 operations. The decrease is marked in the districts of (4) Diagram illustrating death-rate from small- pox, and degree of protection afforded. 11. The following diagram illustrates the death-rates from small-pox in each district with side by side the proportion of population protected against the disease by vaccination during the past seven years:(4) Diagram illustrates the death-rates from small-pox in earn district with side by side the proportion o t the disease by vaccination during the past seven years :(5) Deaths from small-pox. 12. The total number of deaths from small-pox during the year was 45,742, and the ratio per mille of the population .58, against 48,207 and .62, respectively, of the previous year. The largest number of deaths was recorded in the districts of Midnapore 11,714, Patna 4,301, Gaya 2,833, Singhbhum 2,588, Manbhum 2,137, Sonthal Parganas 2,024, Rangpore 1,915, Cuttack 1,807, Monghyr 1,597, Mymensingh 1,477, 24-Parganas 1,055, and Bankura 1.018; whereas in the districts of Noa- khali, Nadia, Chittagong, Darjeeling, Khulna, Rajshahi, and Birbhum, the mortality was lowest, viz., 10, 12, 14, 14, 23, 39, and 47, respectively. It may be remarked that deaths occurring from measles or chicken-pox, when complicated with pneumonia or bronchitis, are by mistake entered under the head &quot;small-pox,&quot; as has been noticed by the Civil Medical Officer, Palamau. He has also noted that deaths from small-pox bear a small propor- tion to the number of cases. In connection with the stamping out of small-pox epidemics, difficulty is experienced in some places in carrying on re-vaccination owing specially to the unwillingness of the people to pay fees for re-vaccination. This has been par- ticularly noticed by the Civil Medical Officer, Sonthal Parganas. Animal Vaccination Depôts. 13. In the Animal Vaccination Depôts in Calcutta and Darjeeling, 596 and 237 calves were vaccinated against 417 and 239, respectively, of the previous year. The quantity of lanoline paste manufactured was 103,470 and 47,701 grains, res- pectively, against 74,325 and 61,842 grains, respectively, of the previous year. The increase of work in the Calcutta Depôt was due to the separation of the dep6t of the Corporation from the Government Depôt since October last, which enabled the Government Depôt staff to devote their time and energy exclusively to the supply of lymph to the mafussal which needed expansion. Different methods of vaccination. 14. During the past year 214,764 primary vaccinations were performed with calf-lymph, 399,205 with lanoline lymph, and 1,978,208 by the arm-to-arm process, against 323,884, 244,244, and 1,961,650, respectively, of the previous year. The ratio per cent. of success under each of these methods was 98.13, 96.75, and 98.38, respectively. Re-vaccinations were also performed under each of the above processes of vaccination with a success of 74.04, 62.20, and 67.40 per cent., respectively. Supply of lymph to the Nepal Durbar and Sikkim State. 15. Five hundred and fifty-five grains of lymph were supplied from the Animal Vaccination Depôt, Darjeeling, to the Nepal Durbar, which is reported to have produced very good results. Seven hundred and five grains of lymph were also supplied from the same Depôt to the Sikkim State. 16. Inspection.STATISTICAL RETURNS.

C. CLARKSON, MAJOR, I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal. B. S. PressMUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT SANITATION. DARJEELING, THE 30TH JUNE 1903. RESOLUTION( 2 ) year old reported in 1902, as compared with that reported in 1894, is very nearly equal to the total mortality from all causes in all the town areas put together. 4. Deaths from fever formed 69 per cent. of the whole number reported, which was a smaller proportion than in any of the previous eight years, with the exception of the year 1900. A comparison of the three triennial periods shows that from 1894 to 1896 the mortality averaged 1,731,437; from 1897 to 1899 it fell to 1,568,631; and from 1900 to 1902 it rose again to 1,680,915. It is satisfactory to observe that in the Province as a whole the mortality did not rise to its former level. A further analysis of the figures discloses that in Eastern Bengal (i.e., in the Dacca and Chittagong Divisions) the mortality rose during the second period, and remained practically at the same level during the third; that in the Burdwan, Presidency, Rajshahi, and Orissa Divisions it fell, and then rose to a higher level than before; that in Bihar (i,e., in the Patna and Bhagalpur Divisions) it fell in the first and rose again in the third period, but the later level was much below the first; and that in Chota Nagpur the mortality in each period was lower than that in the preceding. The actual average annual mortality in the three triennial periods was :( 3 ) has not been sufficient to justify any definite pronouncement as to its utility. Inoculation, which from the first has been a purely voluntary measure, was resorted to in the few districts in which there was a demand for it, but though, so far as ascertained results show, the immunity which it conferred was unmis- takable, the demand was very small and was confined to three districts only 8. The death-rate from small-pox in 1902 (.77 per mille) was much higher than that recorded in any other year during the decade, and this fact is no doubt largely responsible for the increase in the number of vaccine operations which is noticed in the Sanitary Commissioner's notes on vaccination for the year 1902-1903. Singhbhum and Midnapore were the districts worst affect ed, the epidemic having apparently survived in both cases from the previous year, in which the mortality from small-pox was also unusually high. The consequent increase in the number of operations during these two years is noticeable as indicative both of energetic measures of repression on the part of the authorities, and of a growing belief in the efficacy of vaccination on the part of the populace. The invariably high death-rate in the three districts of the Orissa Division, particularly in Cuttack and Puri, has on several occasions attracted the notice of the Lieutenant-Governor, who has been led to conclude that it is to an appreciable extent due to their contiguity to Native States, in many of which the resort to vaccination, even where it has taken root, is only of comparatively recent growth. Recent enquiries, moreover, have shown that the old prejudice in favour of inoculation survives with more vigour in this Division, and in the adjoining Political States, than elsewhere in Bengal, and His Honour has already taken steps to enlist the assistance of the executive authorities, both in British and in Independent Territory, in the suppression of the practice. The rapid advance made in 1902-1903 in the spread of vaccination in the Political States of Chota Nagpur is peculiarly gratifying, and the Lieutenant-Governor sees in it the fruits of a measure recently undertaken with the full co-operation of the Chiefs under which a system of trained supervision was introduced, the cost being contributed in proportion to their areas and population by the various States concerned, with the object of checking and improving the work of the vaccinators. The introduction of a similar system in the Orissa States is under discussion, and the useful object-lesson afforded by Chota Nagpur should help to convince the Orissa Chiefs of its utility. 9. The general results of the year in regard to vaccination are dis- tinctly satisfactory from a departmental point of view, and they bear out the conclusion to which the Lieutenant-Governor has independently arrived in favour of the continuance of the licensed, as opposed to the paid, system of vaccination. There was a decided increase in the proportion of persons successfully vaccinated, the total ratio being 34.22 per mille against 32.68 in 1901-1902, and the average number of operations performed by each licensed vaccinator rose from 944 to 990, while the average cost to Provincial and Local Funds of each successful case remained unchanged. The Lieutenant- Governor would, however, be glad if the Sanitary Commissioner could arrange to adduce some more direct evidence than is at present furnished of the efficacy of vaccination in warding off the disease or mitigating its severity. It might be possible to arrange that whenever a death from small-pox is reported, information should at the same time be obtained from the chaukidar or other reporting agency, whether the death is that of a vaccinated or of an unvacci- nated person. If this could be done, a real criterion of the success of vaccination would be available, which might serve to convince the general public of the value of this means of prevention; and moreover the continual enquiry whether the deceased had been vaccinated would direct their attention to the subject and lead them to note the evidence themselves. 10. The Sanitary Board had under consideration during the year a number of schemes for the improvement of the water-supply, the drainage and the conservancy of various localities, but the work actually carried out was not of importance. A system of cleansing villages and rural towns was, however, inaugurated by the Patna Sadar Local Board in the previous year, and was carried on during the year under review. The procedure is for members of the Board to report the names of villages in the vicinity of their places of abode which they find to be in an insanitary state; an annual programme is
( 4 ) prepared; estimates are drawn up; and cleansing operations are carried out under the supervision of the members of the Board. The operations consist of the cleansing of the village sites, the conservancy of the village, the removal of filth and rank vegetation, the filling up of ditches, and the like. The experiment is an exceedingly interesting one, and the Lieutenant-Governor hopes that it may have a future before it. 11. The Sanitary Board also continued the enquiry into the septic system for the disposal of sewage.

The follow- ing officers served as Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioners :( 2 ) Out of the 49 districts of Bengal, including the Tributary States of Orissa and Chota Nagpur, there was an increase of operations in 28 and a decrease in 21 districts. The increase is most marked in the following districts:( 3 ) States of Orissa, Puri, Noakhali, Cuttack and Balasore, it was below 200 per mille. The protection afforded to infants in municipalities is shown in Appendix VII attached to the report. It will be seen that 711 per mille of the surviving infant population was protected during the year against 723 of the previous year. The cause of the excess number of vaccinations over the available population in some municipalities as shown in the statement is the same as stated in the last report. The attention of Civil Surgeons has again been drawn to their respon- sibility in the matter of infant vaccination in towns where the protection is inadequate. 7.

CLARKSON, MAJOR, I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal. B. S. PressMUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. SANITATION. DARJEELING, THE 8TH JUNE 1904. RESOLUTION( 2 ) (7.34 per cent.), and other causes (.58 per cent.). The remarks of the Sanitary Commissioner and the Calcutta Health Officer regarding infant mortality in that city are interesting and no doubt generally sound. The Lieutenant- Governor does not, however, concur in attributing the excessive mortality to bad midwifery; for although this is no doubt an important factor in infant mortality, skilled medical aid both in hospitals and from private practitioners is much more easily obtained in Calcutta than elsewhere. Some part of the difference may be accounted for by better registration. The facts stated in paragraph 7 of the report indicate how defective registration is elsewhere. 6. To enable a comparison to be readily instituted between the year under review and the preceding ten years, and also to ascertain how far the statistics throw light on the progress of disease, the Lieutenant-Governor has caused tables to be prepared showing the average annual mortality from cholera, fever, small-pox and dysentery and diarrh( 3 ) of Calcutta in his report for 1902-1903 drew attention to the fact that this disease had apparently a five-years' cycle in Calcutta, and the same tendency to periodicity has been observed elsewhere. After allowing the fullest weight to this suggestion, however, Sir Andrew Fraser is constrained to conclude, from the facts before him, that the Department as at present organised is unable to cope with the disease. A principal requisite of the Department is adequate supervision to secure that all the vaccinations reported have been effectively carried out; and proposals for reorganising the Depart- ment and for increasing the superior staff are now under consideration. The widespread increase of the disease emphasises the necessity for thorough reform; and His Honour will give due weight to the fact before formulating a final scheme. 10. The statistics relating to dysentery and diarrh( 4 ) remaining third up to a limit of Rs. 5,000 for any one district, and of Rs. 50,000 for the whole province. These conditions have been imposed so that the gifts of Government may take a form which will encourage the villagers to help themselves, and which will foster a spirit of co-operation between the Government and the people. 14. The account given of the work of the Sanitary Board in section XI of the report can hardly be regarded as of much interest. It is a somewhat uninstructive list of items of business. It would have been desirable rather, for the information of Municipalities and District Boards, to have given some account of the large drainage schemes that have been undertaken, and of some of the works connected with water-supply and drainage. It is impossible within the limits of this Resolution to supply this defect. 15. The difficulties connected with the installation of septic tanks have come prominently into notice during the year under review. The interests involved are very great, namely, those of the public, those of the mill-owners who have sunk large sums of money in these installations, and not least those of the various municipalities scattered throughout the mufassal; for if the system can be made thoroughly efficient and unobjectionable one of the most difficult problems of Municipal administration will be solved. The Lieutenant- Governor has accordingly appointed a small committee under the presidency of the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals to enquire into and report on this question with special reference to existing installations. 16. Plague followed its usual course, rising in the beginning of the year till it reached a maximum in the month of March, and then again rapidly declining till September. The areas affected were the Metropolitan districts of Hooghly, Howrah and the 24-Parganas, and eight districts of Bihar. Elsewhere the cases were only sporadic. The number of deaths was 65,680 as compared with 32,967 in 1902 and 78,629 in 1901. The number of attacks in 1903 was 74,265 as against 38,920 in 1902, so that the ratio of attacks to deaths rose from 84.7 to 88.4. This may possibly be due to greater virulence in the epidemic, but is more probably attributable to less care being taken when the disease is finally established to search out cases that do not end fatally than was exercised at the first outbreak. In this connection it may be noted that before the final disappearance of the disease from Hongkong the Medical Officers of that Colony discovered a large number of cases of pestis ambulans amongst persons who to all appearance were well. Although probably nothing could be done to segregate cases of this kind the knowledge of the existence of the disease in this form may prove very useful. 17. Although the mortality from plague during the year under review was much larger than during 1902 and considerably below that for 1901, no satisfactory explanation has been put forward for these somewhat violent fluctuations. One fact seems clear, viz., that the disease has established itself firmly in the North-Western part of the Province coming and going with the seasons with wonderful regularity. The disease may in fact be looked upon in much the same light as any other vegetable crop ; it is affected by climatic conditions and by the nature of the soil in which it grows. The conditions, whether of soil, climate or habitations, or all three, in the Eastern districts seem to be inimical to the propagation of the microbe. The remarks of the Civil Surgeons of Murshidabad, Patna and Saran, and of the Magistrate of Patna are worthy of consideration, especially those of the last named officer. It is a question whether enough is being done in the infected districts in the way of providing medical relief and advice. Although no preventive measures can now be carried out except with the consent of the people, still a great deal can be done through the influence of medical officers acting in sympathy with the people, and the conditions are sufficiently serious to justify exceptional efforts. Before the commencement of the next cold weather the Lieutenant-Governor will take an opportunity of consulting personally on this subject with the Commissioners of the Presidency, Patna and Bhagalpur Divisions, and will ascertain their opinion on the views expressed above, and will consider any suggestions they may have to offer. 18. Tho Sanitary Commissioner does not refer in his report to the mortality from plague amongst persons who have been inoculated with anti- plague vaccine. Apparently he has overlooked the orders of the Government
( 5 ) of India, conveyed in their letter No. 1367-76, dated the 9th September. 1903, directing that the information collected on the subject should be furnished by the Sanitary Commissioner in his Annual Report in as complete and accurate a form as circumstances permit. The Sanitary Commissioner has been requested to furnish this information separately, and his attention has at the same time been drawn to the suggestion in paragraph 1 of the Resolution on his report for 1902 that Divisional totals should be inserted in certain tables, and to the request in paragraph 12 that in his next report he would give his own opinion regarding certain cases in which no marked improvement had followed the introduction of water-supply and drainage schemes. The latter subject is discussed in paragraph 62 of the present report, but no explanation has been given regarding the town of Dacca, which is included in the list in Statement I of Appendix II, and which was inspected during the year.

In India[Maximum limit, 10 pages.] TRIENNIAL REPORT OF VACCINATION IN BENGAL FOR, THE YEARS 1902-1903,1903-1904, AND 1904-1905. Officer in charge of the Depart- ment. This report deals with the triennial period 1902-1903 to 1904-1905. MajorH. J. Dyson, I.M.S., was in charge of the Depart- ment from 1st April to 30th June 1902, Captain (now Major) B. H. Deare, I.M.S., from 4th August 1902 to 10th March 1903, Major F. C. Clarkson, I.M.S., from 11th March 1903 to 15th March 1905, and Captain W. Clemesha, I.M.S., from 1st July to 3rd August 1902 and again from 16th to 31st March 1905. 2. In the Metropolitan circle, there was no Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioner from 1st April to 21st May 1902, from 30 th April to 8th May 1903, from 5th August to 30th August 1903, and from 16th to 31st March 1905. The Northern Bengal Circle was also without a Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioner from 1st July to 3rd August 1902, and from 5th to 16th September 1903. Strength of Staff. 3. In Calcutta the average number of Inspecting officers and operatorswas 7 and 28 against 8 and 31, respectively, of 1899( 2 ) in 20 districts during the past year. The increase is most striking in the following districts:( 3 ) Whilst it is impossible, within the scope of this report, to go into the causes why particular districts are forward or backward, a few instances may be taken. The old Bhojpuri kingdom, as a whole, is one of the most bitterly opposed to vaccination. Shahabad, parts of Chapra, Ghazipur and Ballia in the United Provinces are all backward districts: on this account vaccination is only done with great difficulty. Unfortunately plague is now an additional diffiulty and has put back the work considerably this year. It is a mistake to compare Arrah with Patna and Gaya, which, as is well known, belonged to a distinct kingdom of Mogadh where vaccination does not meet with as much opposition. The Ferazie districts of Lower Bengal are probably the most difficult to vaccinate in the whole Province. The fact that Faridpur and Backergunge district figures are on the whole good is simply due to the exceptionally good work of the Inspectors and Civil Surgeons. Very nearly all the Sadar Subdivisions in Bihar are behind the other parts of the district; the reason is simply that the law is well known, vaccination is optional and opposition is strong. Protection afforded to infants. 5. During the year 1904-05, out of 2,678,559, the estimated number ofinfants under one year available for vaccination, 1,029,548, that is, 384.36 per thousand were successfully vaccinated, against 359.66 of 1903-04 and 360.51 of 1902-03. This shows that some improvement is gradually being made. A very large majority of the people of Bengal object to have their infant children vaccinated and this, together with the fact that malaria is prevalent during the greater portion of the vaccination season in many parts of the Province, tends to lower the rate of infant protection. Improvement in this respect must be slow. The apathy of the people in the matter of infant vaccination is evident from the figures of Calcutta, the most advanced town of India, which show that only 90 per thousand of the infant population of that town was vaccinated during the past year. The above calculation, however, is based on the estimated birthrate of the Province. If the actual number of births of the town is taken into calculation, the ratio would come up to 255 per thousand only, but this even falls far short of what it should be. In 12 districts, viz., Ranchi 904, Palamau 775, Malda 768, Faridpur 744, Hazaribagh 682, Political States of Chota Nagpur 653, Bhagalpur 634, Purnea 634, Manbhum 625, Darjeeling 608, Sonthal Parganas 570 and Jalpaiguri 506, the protection was over 500 per mille, while in four districts only, viz., Balasore 199, Tributary States of Orissa 190, Tippera 186, and Puri 83, it was below 200 per mille. It is interesting to notice that in the districts of Midnapore, Cuttack and Noakhali, where the work as a whole has increased owing to the active help of the district authorities, the rate of infant protection has also increased from 186.10, 146.55 and 170.99 of 1903-04 to 424.07, 218.67 and 403.09, respectively, of 1904-05. There is also a marked improvement noticeable in the district of Faridpur where the rate of successful infant vaccination has increased from 595 of 1903-04 to 744 during the past year. Although I doubt the accuracy of the figures, still I think that some improvement is being made owing to the energy and exertions of the Civil Surgeon and the District Inspector of Vaccination. I mention the case of Faridpur to show what good can be done by energetic Inspecting officers. Unfortunately among the subordinate vaccination inspecting staff we have only a very few good men who are really tactful and know how to advance the cause of vaccination. This, apart from local conditions, is also an important factor in determining the progress or retrogression of vaccination work in a district. The protection afforded to infants in municipalities is shown in Appendix VII attached to the report. It will be seen that 623 per mille of the surviving infant population was protected during the past year against 711 of 1903-04 and 723 of 1902-03. The average of the triennial period under review was 683 against 576 of 1899-1900 to 1901-02. The cause of the excess number of vaccination over the available population in some municipalities as shown in the statement is the same as explained in previous reports. The attention of Civil Surgeons has as usual been drawn to their responsibility in the matter of infant vaccination in towns where the protection is inadequate.
( 4 ) Recess work. 6. During the recess or non-working season of 1904-05, 191,700 opera- tions were performed chiefly in connection with small-pox epidemics and the up-keep of lymph for emergencies, against 193,056 of 1903-04 and 291,460 of 1902-03. The average of the triennial period under review was 225,405, against 144,244 of 1899-1902. Six-puncture vaccination. 7. During 1904-05, 832,542 successful primary operations were perform- ed in six points, against 733,802 of 1903-04 and 711,221 of 1902-03. The number of revaccinations was 8,337, against 11,653 of 1903-04 and 25,963 of 1902-03. The falling off in revaccinations during the past year is due to the less prevalence of small-pox. When small-pox is prevalent revaccination can be performed, when it is absent it is almost practically impossible. The average of the triennial period in primary and revaccination was 759,188 and 15,318, against 549,432 and 11,316 respectively of the previous epoch. There was an increase of 209,756 success- ful primary and 4,002 revaccination cases, which shows that this method of vaccination is being gradually and more extensively introduced among the people. Factory and tea-garden vaccina- tion. 8. During the past year, the total number of primary and revaccinationsperformed in factories and tea-gardens in Bengal was 9,276 and 210, against 11,034 and 879 respec- tively of 1903-04 and 10,071 and 1,192 respectively of 1902-03. The ratio of success in primary and revaccination cases was 98.72 and 45.23, against 99.07, 35.49 and 95.99 and 49.24 respectively of 1903-04 and 1902-03. Cost of, and contribution towards, vaccination. 9. The total average cost of vaccination in Bengal for the triennialperiod under review was Rs. 1,97,642, excluding the expenditure of the Calcutta Municipality for the year 1904-05, for which figures has not yet been' received, against Rs. 1,86,782 of 1899-1902.the cost of each successful vaccination being 1 anna 2 pie, against 1 anna 3 pie. Out of the total average cost of vaccination as shown above, Rs. 4,713 werecontributed by District Boards, Rs._4,004 by Native States, and Rs. 212 fromother sources, against Rs. 4,188, Rs. 2,399 and Rs. 292 respectively of theprevious triennial period 1899-1902.

( 5 ) Diagram illustrating death-rate from small- pox, and degree of protection afforded. 10. The following diagram illustrates the death-rates from small-pox in each district with side by side the proportion of population protected against the disease by vaccination during the past seven years :( 7 ) It is extremely difficult to draw any useful conclusions from this diagram, because there is in the best vaccinated district quite sufficient susceptible material to keep an epidemic of small-pox alive. In this country it is usually the adults amongst whom the greatest number of deaths from small-pox occur and who keep the disease alive. Twenty-five years ago vaccination of children was not as good as it is now, consequently the number of unvaccinated adults of about 25 years of age is much greater than the number of unvaccinated children at five years. Also even, if adults have been vaccinated as children, they may contract the disease themselves, though the chances of recovery are much below if they have been protected in childhood. Small-pox has a sort of periodicity. It usually is more or less prevalent in epedemic form once in five years in any given district. In consequence of an epedemic of the disease, vaccination of many of the susceptible persons is carried out and the disease disappears and remains quiet for some time. In Northern Bengal, Nepal is a constant source of infection from which the neighbouring districts contract the disease. It is only the fact that the Darjeeling district is very well vaccinated that keeps the small-pox figures as low as they are there. Deaths from small-pox. 11. During the past year, the total number of deaths from small-poxin the Province was 14,846, against 26,168 of 1903-04 and 45,742 of 1902-03, the ratio of deaths per 1,000 of the population being .19, against .33 and .58 respectively of 1903-04 and 1902-03. The largest number of deaths was recorded in the districts of Dacca 1,409, Puri 1,218, Pabna 1,021, Darbhanga 771, Muzaffarpur 744, Birbhum 706 and Jalpaiguri 702, whereas the mortality was lowest in the districts of Khulna 4, Jessore 7, Darjeeling 8, Singhbhum 11, Hazaribagh 12, Manbhum 13, and Noakhali 15. It will be seen from statement No. VI attached to this report that there has been a diminution in the death-rate in a large majority of the districts of Bengal as compared with the previous year. In accordance with the orders contained in paragraph 9 of the Government Resolution on the Annual Vaccination Report of this Department for the year 1902-03, statistics were obtained from Civil Surgeons showing the number of persons protected or unprotected among those who died from small-pox during the past year. Out of 14,846 deaths, statistics have been furnished of 11,763 which show that 4,662 were protected by vaccination and 5,873 were unprotected and 1,228 not ascertained. The figures, however, are so unreliable that no conclusion can be based on them. Animal Vaccination Depôts. 12. In the Animal Vaccination Depôts at Calcutta and Darjeeling, theaverage number of calves vaccinated was 795 and 223 respectively, against 427 and 194 respectively of the previous triennial period. The average quantity of lanoline paste in grains manufactured was 127,243 and 50,245 respectively, against 66,319 and 53,903 respectively of 1899-1902. It will be seen that the work of the Calcutta Animal Vaccination Depôt has increased nearly twofold. The demand on it is increasing every year. The depôt at Elliot Road was too small to be able to meet the continual increased requisitions for lymph; it was therefore removed to a more com- modious building at Entally in April 1905, and arrangements are being made for manufacturing larger quantities of lymph to meet all present demandsl and to send the fresh paste direct to the vaccinators instead of through Civil Surgeons and Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors as before, thus minimising the chance of deterioration of the quality of the lymph supplied. Different methods of vaccination. 13. During the past year, 216,520 primary vaccinations were performedwith lymph taken direct from the calf, 421,157 with lanoline lymph, and 2,160,329 by the arm- to-arm process, against 212,537, 415,310 and 2,006,716 respectively of 1903-04 and 214,764, 399,205 and 1,978,208 respectively of 1902-03. The ratio per cent. of success under each of these methods of vaccination was 99.11,95.51 and 98.57 respectively, against 98.83, 97.01 and 98.35 respectively of 1903-04 and 98.13, 96.75 and 98.38 of 1902-03. The number of revaccinations under each of these processes of vaccination was 21,926, 37,718 and 40,257 with a success of 68.84, 51.79 and 58.49 per cent. respectively, against 26,001, 31,841 and 56,233 with a success of 65.89, 65.87 and 66.94 per cent. respectively of 1903-04 and 50,429, 39,992 and 99,374 with a success of 74.04, 62.20 and 67.40 per cent. respectively of 1902-03. Antiseptic vaccination. 14. In accordance with the orders contained in Government orderNo. 929T.M., dated the 28th May 1904, antisepticvaccination was introduced during the last workingseason in the districts of Burdwan, Howrah, 24-Parganas, Dacca and Murshida-
( 8 ) bad and in the municipal areas of the districts of Patna, Bhagalpur, Hazaribagh and Cuttack. In Rajshahi the system, it is stated, was not introduced owing to three changes of Civil Surgeons during the vaccination working season and in the district of Muzaffarpur, it was tried only in the town of Muzaffarpur. The Civil Surgeons concerned report that selected vaccinators were employed in the work and that practical instructions as to the use of the new method were given them before they commenced work. The result is reported to be satisfactory. In Hazaribagh the experiments were carried on under the direc- tions and personal supervision of the Civil Surgeon, Captain Newman, I.M.S., who has shown by facts and figures the superiority of the antiseptic method of vaccination over the ordinary method. His report is very interesting, and I am submitting it to Government separately with my remarks. Supply of lymph to the Nepal Durbar and Sikkim. 15. One hundred and ninety grains of lymph were supplied from theAnimal Vaccination Depôt, Darjeeling, to the Nepal Durbar. Five hundred and thirty grains were also supplied to the Sikkim State. The results are reported to have been satisfactory. Inspections. 16. During the past year the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners of theMetropolitan and Eastern Bengal, Northern and Western Circles, inspected each 5,119, 17,855 and 7,408 cases respectively. The percentage of success in primary and revaccination cases inspected by them was 98.59 and 75.87 respectively. Among Civil Surgeons two only, viz., Pabna and Champaran, inspected over 10,000 operations; 13 between 5,000 to 10,000; 19 between 2,000 and 5,000; 6 between 1,000 and 2,000, and 8 less than 1,000. The percentage of success in primary and revaccination cases inspected by them was 97.86 and 61.93 respectively. Of the subordinate inspecting staff, 22 District Inspectors of Vaccination inspected more than 50 per cent. of the primary operations in their respective charges; 9 between 40 and 50 per cent., and 18 between 20 and 40 per cent. Inspections. In 15 districts, the Sub Inspectors of Vaccination inspected more than80 per cent. of the primary operations performed in their jurisdictions; in 26 districts between 50 and 80 per cent., and in 9 only below 50 per cent. The percentage of success reported by the Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors of Vaccination was 97.71 and 97.37 respectively in primary cases, and 53.60 and 54.09 in re-vaccination, the success reported by the vaccinators in the returns being 98.15 and 58.23 respectively under the above heads. Suitable notice has as usual been taken departmentally of the inadequate inspections performed by the subordinate inspecting staff. General remarks. 17. The question of the re-organization of the Vaccination Department isstill under the consideration of Government, hence very little need be said on the subject of changes. To my mind the change that is most needed on the score of economy is a reduction in the number of Sub-Inspectors. Many of these men are useless, lazy to an almost incredible degree and are completely out of touch with the Civil Surgeons. Rewards for good work are being distributed for the first time this year, and it is hoped will act as a stimulus to further exertions on the part of the vaccinators. It is not so much radical change of system that is required in this Depart- ment, as carefully thought-out gradual improvement. The great imperfections under which we labour are (i) want of education of vaccinators and inspecting officers; (ii) the lack of inducements for vaccinators to improve their work or their knowledge of English; (iii) the enormous preponderance of arm-to-arm vaccination over other methods. These three are the greatest defects that exist at present, and it is very desirable that steps be taken to remedy them. Following on these, aseptic method of vaccination can be taught to the vaccinators and introduced through- out the Province, but it is futile to expect the average vaccinator left to himself either to understand or carry out more scientific methods. These points have been brought to the notice of Government in separate notes. Another point that requires considerable attention is the systematizing of the work of vaccinators in municipal towns; at present in many places nothing like all the available children are vaccinated. This is simply a matter of organization, and great improvements should be made in a comparatively short time. CALCUTTA, W. W. CLEMESHA, M.D., D.P.H., CAPTAIN, I.M.S., The 29th May, 1905. Offg.

RESOLUTION No. 1824T.( 2 ) 4disicts. District Officers will again be asked to do what they can during their tours to promote the cause of vaccination by enlisting the sympathy of the people with whom they may come in contact and by taking a personal interest in the work done by the vaccinators. 4. The question of making the vaccinating staff more efficient has recently engaged the attention of the Lieutenant-Governor. Proposals for raising the status of the inspecting officers have been submitted to the Government of India, and a system of rewards to vaccinators has been introduced. A scheme for the better training of the vaccinators and inspecting staff and for the more extended use of calf lymph is under consideration. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, E. A. GAIT, Offg. Secretary to the Govt. of Bengal. Circular No. 33T.ANNUAL STATISTICAL RETURNS AND SHORT NOTES ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL FOR THE YEAR 1905-1906. BY W. W.

Published at the BENGAL SECRETARIAT BOOK DEPÔT, Writers' Buildings, Calcutta. OFFICIAL AGENTS. In India[Maximum limit, 4 pages.] SHORT NOTES ON VACCINATION FOR THE YEAR 1905-1906. THE following are brief notes on Vaccination in Bengal for the year 1905-06:( 2 ) Out of the 33 districts of Bengal, including the Tributary States of Orissa and excluding the district of Sambalpur of which the figures for the last year are not available, there was an increase of operations in 23 districts, whereas a decrease occurred only in 10 districts. The increase is specially noticeable in the following districts:( 3 ) Factory and Tea-garden vac- cination. 9. In factories and tea-gardens with a population of 117,071, 5,558 opera- tions were performed, of which 3,813 were primary and 1,745 re-vaccination cases. The ratio of success in primary and re-vaccination cases was 95.59 and 37.30 respectively. Cost of and contribution towards vaccination. 10. The total cost of vaccination during the year was Rs. 157,803 againstRs. 1,35,834 of the previous year (excluding the figures of Calcutta which have not been received). The average cost of each successful case of vaccina- tion was 1 anna and 3 pies against 1 anna and 2 pies of 1904-05. The District Boards, Native States and Cantonments, Dispensaries, etc., contributed Rs. 6,494, Rs. 8,149 and Rs. 190, respectively, against Rs. 3,330, Rs. 2,821 and Rs. 338, respectively, of the previous year.

The following diagram illustrates the death-rates from small-pox in eachdistrict with side by side the proportion of popula- tion protected against the disease by vaccination during the past seven years :[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]
( 5 ) Deaths from small-pox. 12. The total number of deaths from small-pox during the year was12,090 and the ratio per mille of the population .22 against 9,572 and .17, respectively, of the previous year. The districts of Puri, Calcutta, Bhagalpur, Howrah, Murshidabad, Patna and Burdwan show the largest number of deaths, viz., 2,894, 1,988, 732, 674, 653, 528 and 488 respectively; while in the districts of Ranchi, Sambal- pore, Palamau, Darjeeling, Manbhum, Hazaribagh and Singbhum, the mortality was lowest, viz., 1, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13 and 17 respectively. Out of the 12,090 persons who died of small-pox, 3,821 were reported to have been protected, 5,918 unprotected; while in 2,351 cases, the results were not ascertained. No reliance can, however, be placed on these figures and no useful conclusions can be drawn from them. Animal Vaccination Depôts. 13. In the Animal Vaccination Depôts in Calcutta and Darjeeling, 1,621and 210 calves were vaccinated against 1,023 and 204, respectively, of the previous year. The quan- tity of lanoline paste manufactured was 223,322 and 61,823 grains respectively against 147,579 and 53,846 grains respectively of the previous year. Different methods of Vaccina- tion. 14. During the past year 151,080 primary operations were performedwith calf lymph, 400,847 with lanoline lymph, and 1,352,698 by the arm-to-arm process against 101,952, 292,726, and 1,364,446, respectively, of the previous year. The ratio per cent. of success under each of these methods was 98.92, 96.57 and 99.21, respectively, against 99.30, 95.81 and 98.95 respectively of the previous year. Re-vaccinations under each of the above processes of vacccination show a success of 58.81, 53.98 and 78.02 per cent. respectively. Supply of lymph to the Nepal Darbar and Sikkim State. 15. Three hundred and eighty and 860 grains of lymph were supplied fromthe Animal Vaccination Depôt, Darjeeling, to the Nepal Darbar and the Sikkim State respectively. The result is reported to have been satisfactory. Inspections. 16. During the past year, I myself inspected about 450, the DeputySanitary Commissioner of the Bengal and Orissa Circle 14,742 and the Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioner, Bihar and Chota Nagpore Circle 9,053 cases. Among Civil Surgeons, two only, viz., Saran and Muzaffarpur, inspected more than 10,000 operations; 10 from 5,000 to 10,000; 18 from 2,000 to 5,000; 3 from 1,000 to 2,000 and 1 only less than 1,000. Of the subordinate inspecting staff, 17 District Inspectors of Vaccination inspected more than 50 per cent. of the primary operations in their respective charges; 8 between 40 and 50 per cent.; 6 between 20 and 40 per cent.; and 1 only below 20 per cent. In 9 districts, the Sub-Inspectors of Vaccination inspected more than 80 per cent. of the primary operations done within their jurisdiction; in 23 dis- tricts between 50 and 80 per cent. and in 3 only below 50 per cent. Suitable notice has been taken departmentally of the inadequate inspection performed by the subordinate inspecting staff. General Remarks. 17. It may be remarked generally that the good results of the reformslately introduced into the department have already begun to be felt. The system of grantingrewards to vaccinators has already stimulated the vaccinators of some districts to greater activity in their work, and complaints about non-realization of fees by vaccinators are getting less frequent. It is hoped that after the schemes recently sanctioned by Government about the education of vaccinators and the general substitution of prepared lymph for arm-to-arm vaccination, are brought into operation, which will be shortly, much improvement will be effected. Antiseptic vaccination has already produced good results in the districts where it has been introduced, and now that a regular system of training will be given to the vaccinators, it will be desirable to introduce it generally in the province. A proposal on the subject will be submitted to Government shortly. 18. The prescribed statements are appended to these notes. W. W. CLEMESHA, M.D., D.P.H., CAPTAIN, I.M.S., Offg.

W. W. CLEMESHA, M.D., D.P.H., CAPTAIN, I.M.S., Offg. Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal. B. S. PressMUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. SANITATION. CALCUTTA, THE 7TH JULY 1906. RESOLUTION No. 1710S. READ( 2 ) 1905. The causes of this great loss of infant life were discussed in the Resolu- tion recorded by Government on the Sanitary Report for 1904, and there is little now to add to the subject. Leaflets in the vernacular were prepared by the Sanitary Commissioner containing simple instructions for the rearing and care of infants and also prescribing the diet of Indian mothers after childbirth, and were distributed broadcast through the province. These may in time do good by helping to remove old prejudices and by bringing to the homes of the mass of the people the light of modern ideas. The highest infantile mortality (310 per mille) was, as usual, recorded in Calcutta. Cholera.( 3 ) open additional distributing centres at village schools so that no area may be more than 5 miles from a dispensary or a post office or a school where the drug is distributed. The prevalence of malaria in Bengal has for many years engaged the attention of Government, and in March 1905 prominent attention was drawn to it by a member of the Legislative Council who asked for the appointment of a Commission or Committee of Enquiry to investigate the causes of death from malaria in Bengal and the remedies to be applied. It is believed that, particularly in the Presidency Division, the main cause of malaria is the obstruction of drainage caused by the gradual rise of the delta, and two important drainage projects have already been determined on in this Division, namely, the Magra Hát scheme in the 24-Parganas and the Bhairab Valley scheme in Jessore. The Lieutenant-Governor has now decided that the whole of the Presidency Division should be examined, and that a list should be prepared of all practicable drainage schemes, so that a definite programme of action may be drawn up. With this object a small Committee has been appointed, whose duty it will be to ascertain in what areas in the Presidency Division malaria is prevalent, and if the cause of the disease is held to be obstructed drainage, to decide whether a drainage scheme is practicable and to prepare a list of such schemes arranged in order of urgency. The Report of the Committee is to be submitted to Government before the end of March 1907. On the other hand, in order to ascertain to what extent drainage works produce a beneficial effect in lessening the ravages of malaria, instructions have recently been issued to the Sanitary Commissioner to make special investiga- tions in those areas which have been influenced by such projects. The malaria index will be worked out in the tract both before and after the completion of the drainage works; the death-rate from fever will be carefully recorded in each area for five years before and five years after the completion of the schemes ; and at all hospitals and dispensaries in the tracts affected the attend- ance of patients suffering from malaria will be ascertained for the quinquennial periods both before and after the completion of the works. Dysentery and Diarrh( 4 ) The cost of the process is also exceedingly low. At the request of this Government, Dr. Gilbert Fowler, a specialist in the biological disposal of sewage, was sent out from England to enquire into the septic tank installa- tions in Bengal. He conducted his enquiries during the period from January to April 1906, and his report is awaited by Government. The Sanitary Commissioner reports that septic tank latrines are an entire success when used for communities such as mills, large schools, railway workshops, and the like, and he is now considering whether they cannot be adapted to municipal towns. He will be asked to submit a report embodying the results of his experiments. The Sanitary Commissioner has also made a number of sugges- tions for the adoption in municipalities of the septic tank method as a substitute for trenching grounds. Mention should be made in the next Sanitary. Report as to what extent Municipal Commissioners have been able to adopt his proposals.

THE following are brief notes on vaccination in Bengal for the year 1906-07. Officer in charge of the Depart- ment. 2. Captain W. W. Clemesha, I.M.S., was in charge of the Department from 1st April to 15th November 1906, and I for the rest of the year. The following officers served as Deputy Sanitary Commissioners: ( 2 ) prevalence of malarial fever during October, November and December 1906. In Nadia, the same causes which were in operation in Jessore with certain additional factors, viz., cholera and extreme difficulty in realizing fees, tended to bring about the decrease. In Howrah, the decrease is chiefly in Municipal vaccination. It is due to a large number of operations having been performed in the Howrah town in the previous year in connection with the suppression of small-pox. In the rural areas of the district, the decrease is said to be due to the outbreak of cholera of a virulent type during the greater part of the vaccination season. In Darbhanga, it is ascribed to famine. It is reported that many parents refused vaccination for inability to pay fees and many children were so weak that vaccination could not be safely done. In Birbhum, it is due to the prevalence of a malignant type of malarial fever and of cholera, and the illness of the staff. In the 24-Parganas, it is said to be due to the outbreak of cholera through- out the district, and to slackness of the vaccinators owing to difficulty in realizing vaccination fees. Vaccination in Municipalities. 5. In the Calcutta Municipality, 41,300 operations were performed duringthe year against 85,287 of 1905-06. There was a decrease of 43,987 cases, which the Health Officer explains as follows: &quot; Although small-pox has been epidemic in Calcutta during the latter part of the official year 1906-07, the epidemic has not been so severe as it was during the latter part, of 1905-06, hence the number of people who availed themselves of the protection afforded by vaccination was considerably less.&quot; In mufassal municipalities, dispensaries, etc., the number of cases was 145,949 against 122,105 of the previous year, shewing an increase of 23,844. The average work of a vaccinator in mufassal municipalities was 848 against 709, while that of licensed and District Board vaccinators was 934 and 1,778, against 986 and 1,905, respectively, of the previous year. Protection afforded to infants. 6. During the year under review, out of 1,606,128, the estimated numberof infants under one year available for vaccination, 814,772, that is 507.29 per thousand, were success- fully vaccinated, against 476.62 of 1905-06. In 17 districts, viz., Ranchi, Sambalpur, Murshidabad, Palamau, Darjeeling, Bhagalpur, Gaya, Hazaribagh, Sonthal Parganas, Manbhum, Nadia, Midnapore, Monghyr, Angul, Burdwan, Cuttack and Singhbhum, the protection was over 500 per mile, while in one district only, viz., Birbhum, it was below 200 per mille. Although the statistics furnished by the illiterate vaccinators are not always reliable, it may be fairly assumed that infant vaccination is making steady progress from year to year. I am, however, inclined to doubt the accuracy of the figures furnished under this head by the Civil Surgeon of Murshidabad, as it is impossible to believe that this district, which has always been backward in respect of infant vaccination, should at once stand third in the list of the Bengal districts with a protection of 892.71 per mille of the infant population. The matter is being enquired into. The protection afforded to infants in municipalities is shown in Appendix VII attached to the report. It will be seen that 872.88 per mille of the surviving infant population was protected during the year, against 858.20 of the preceding year. Recess work. 7. During the recess or non-working season of the past year, 162,966operations were performed in connection with small- pox epidemics and the upkeep of lymph for emergencies, against 118,937 of the previous year, the increase being almost solely due to the more severe prevalence of the disease in many places. Six-puncture vaccination. 8. The total number of successful primary and re-vaccination operationsin six-points was 793,834 and 13,049, respectively, against 730,800 and 6,336, respectively, of the previous year. Factory and Tea-garden vacci- nation. 9. In Factories and tea-gardens, with a population of 145,897, 5,306operations were performed, of which 3,920 were primary and 1,386 re-vaccination cases. The ratio of success in primary and re-vaccination cases was 98.44 and 42.92, respectively.

( 3 ) Cost of and contribution towards vaccination. 10. The total cost of vaccination during the year was Rs. 1,73,229against Rs. 1,57,803 of the previous year (exclud- ing the figures of the Calcutta Municipality and the Feudatory States of Patna, Sonepur and Bamra in the district of Sambalpur, which have not furnished the required state- ments). The average cost of each successful case of vaccination was 1 anna 5 pies against 1 anna 3 pies of 1905-06. The District Boards, Native States and Cantonments, Dispensaries, etc., contributed Rs. 6,606, Rs. 7,485, and Rs. 271, respectively, against Rs. 6,494, Rs. 8,149, and Rs. 190, respectively of the previous year.

The diagram facing this page illustrates the death-rates from small-poxin each district, with side by side, the proportion of population protected against the disease by vaccination during the past seven years. Deaths from small-pox. 12. The total number of deaths from small-pox during the year was23,543 and the ratio per mille of the population, .43, against 12,090 and .22, respectively, of the previousyear. The districts of Puri, Bhagalpur, Burdwan, Calcutta, 24-Parganas, Howrah, Midnapore, Purnea, Monghyr, Patna, Sonthal Parganas, Balasore, Hooghly and Murshidabad show the largest number of deaths, viz., 4,802, 1,944, 1,834, 1,775, 1,439, 1,077, 1,062, 1,037, 968, 956,937, 862, 771, and756, respectively, while in the districts of Sambalpur, Singhbhum, Palamau, and Ranchi, the mortality was lowest, viz., 3, 6, 18 and 30, respectively. Special steps are being taken to grapple with this scourge in Puri, which generally suffers very heavily from it. Out of 23,543 persons who died of small-pox, 8,865 were reported to have been vaccinated mostly in their childhood or otherwise protected, 10,247 unprotected and in 4,431 cases nothing could be ascertained. 13. In the Animal Vaccination Depôts in Calcutta and Darjeeling, 1,373 and 235 calves were vaccinated against 1,621 and 210, respectively, of the previous year. The quantity of lanoline paste manufactured was 293,250 and 72,575 grains, respectively, against 223,322 and 61,823 grains, respectively, of the previous year. Different methods of vaccina- tion. 14. During the past year, 87,803 primary operations were performed withcalf lymph, 696,415 with lanoline lymph and 1,090,758 by the arm-to-arm process, against. 15,180, 400,847 and 1,352,698, respectively, of the preced- ing year. The ratio per cent. of success under each of these methods was 99.08, 98.25 and 99.13, respectively, against 98.92, 96.57 and 99.21, respectively, of 1905-06. Re-vaccinations under each of the above methods of vaccination show a success of 66.73, 50.29 and 77.75, respectively, against 58.81, 53.98 and 78.02 per cent., respectively, of the previous year. Supply of lymph to the Nepal Darbar, the Sikim State, etc. 15. During the year 1906-07, 350, 1,381 and 335 grains of lymph weresupplied from the Darjeeling Animal Vaccination Depôt to the Nepal Darbar, the Sikim State and the Bhutan State, respectively. Inspections. 16. During the past year, the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner of theBengal and Orissa Circle inspected 12,279 and the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner of the Bihar and Chota Nagpur Circle 26,383 cases. Among Civil Surgeons, only 5, viz., the Civil Surgeons of Muzaffarpur, Saran, Singhbhum, Sonthal Parganas and Midnapore inspected more than 10,000 operations ; 9 from 5,000 to 10,000; 15 from 2,000 to 5,000, 4 from 1,000 to 2,000; and 1 only viz., the Civil Surgeon of Bhagalpur, less than 1,000. Of the subordinate inspecting staff, 17 District Inspectors of Vaccination inspected more than 50 per cent. of the operations in their respective charges; 7 between 40 and 50 per cent; 7 between 20 to 40 per cent., and 1 only below 20 per cent. In 14 districts the Sub-Inspectors of Vaccination inspected more than 80 per cent. of the operations performed in their jurisdictions; in 19 districts, between 50 and 80 per cent., and in 1 only below 50 per cent. Suitable notice has, as usual, been taken departmentally of the inadequate inspection per- formed by the subordinate inspecting staff.
( 4 ) General Remarks. 17. During the beginning of the last vaccination season, a course ofinstruction on (1) the principles of sepsis, (2) the proper method of vaccination, (3) practical instruc- tion in the preparation of vaccine lymph from the calf, and (4) the dangers of arm-to-arm vaccination, was given by the Sanitary Commissioner, the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Bengal and Orrissa Circle, and the Civil Surgeon of Cuttack to the Inspectors of Vaccinations, at Patna, Calcutta and Cuttack. The instruction received by the Inspectors was imparted by them to the Sub-Ins- pectors of Vaccination and the Vaccinators. Anti-septic vaccination was also introduced throughout the Province. The result of the system, on the whole, is reported to be satisfactory, sore arms having greatly diminished. The Civil Surgeons of Gaya and Cuttack, however, do not agree in this view. The systom of realization of vaccination fees through the agency of the village Panchayat, has not been attended with the degree of success expected of it. In some districts, viz., Burdwan, Bankura, 24-Parganas, Murshidabad, Jessore, Shahabad, Saran, Darbrbhanga and Balasore, it is said that no effective help was given, while the Civil Surgeons of Nadia and Champaran report that the fees realized through the Panchayets had to be recovered from them under great pressure. The system of granting rewards to vaccinators, however, has created a healthy stimulus to work and to competition among the better class of vaccinators, and I therefore recommend its continuance. 18.

RESOLUTION( 2 ) outbreaks occurred as usual in the districts of the Patna Division, and the period of greatest prevalence was from January to April, the climax being reached in the month of March when 19,855 deaths were reported. Only nine districts, including Sambalpur, were entirely free from the disease, while in Purnea there was only one death. Only 1,777 inoculations were performed against 1,544 in the preceding year, and only one case of death frem plague among those inoculated was reported. As no less than 1,146 of the total number of inoculations were among the prisoners in the Gaya Jail, it is abvious that inoculation is even now regarded with marked disfavour by ohe people of this Province. The village of Jagadispur, in Shahabad, where the work of rat extermination was carried on in a thorough and systematic manner, enjoyed complete immunity from the disease, although it prevailed with considerable severity in the immediate neighbourhood. This experiment has proved a distinct success, and has afforded an excellent object-lesson of the advantages of a systematic campaign against rats. The Lieutenant- Governor notices with satisfaction that the measure is becoming more popular, and that rat extermination is now being vigorously carried out in many places. 7. Fever.( 3 ) sanitation. He notices with satisfaction the opinion recorded by Lieutenant- Colonel Clarkson that the conservancy arrangements in Municipalities are steadily improving, and that the expenditure under this head is increasing. A brief reference is made to a number of the more important drainage and water-supply schemes under preparation or under actual construction. The Lieutenant-Gevernor will again allude to these when dealing with the annual reports on the working of District Boards and Municipalities. The services of the Sanitary Board and their Engineer were largely used in working out these schemes. 11.

In India [Maximum limit 10 pages.] TRIENNIAL REPORT OF VACCINATION IN BENGAL FOR THE YEARS 1905-06, 1906-07 and 1907-08. THIS report deals with the triennial period 1905-06 to 1907-08. Officer in charge of the Depart- ment. 2. Major W. W. Clemesha, I.M.S., was in charge of the Department from 1st April 1905 to 15th November 1906 and I for the rest of the triennial period. The following officers served as Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioners :( 2 ) The ratio of success under the two different heads, primary and revacci- nation, was 99.22 and 69.97, against 98.77 and 61.94 respectively of 1903-05. The average work of a vaccinator was 1,000, against 891 of the previous triennial period. The average work of a licensed and paid vaccinator was 961 and 1,203, against 905 and 811 respectively of 1903-05. Although the work of the Province was on the whole satisfactory, it may be remarked that the results would have been far better still had not the work been retarded in many districts by scarcity, which made the poor people reluctant to offer their children for vaccination owing to their inability to pay the vaccinators' fees. Applications were received during the year from the Civil Surgeons of Cuttack, Darbhanga, Midnapore, and Bankura for recouping the vaccinators the loss sustained by them on account of the non-realisation of fees from the poor. The case of Cuttack was submitted for the orders of Government, which referred the question for settlement by the Commissioner of the Orissa Division, whose final decision in the matter is not yet known. The Magistrate of Darbhanga did not support the Civil Surgeon's proposal, which had therefore to be dropped. The other two applications are under consideration. In the absence of the compulsory law to enforce vaccination which is the true solution of the small-pox problem, this Department has to depend chiefly on persuasive measures and the good offices of District and Subdivi- sional Magistrates to advance the cause. But persuasion is of no avail with poor people who have not the wherewithal to pay for the bare necessities of life and can ill afford to pay for vaccination, however beneficial it might be. The result is that the vaccinators, who are unpaid men, leave unprotected the areas that are least profitable and carry on their work in places where they get their fees without difficulty and not unfrequently illegal gain in the shape of articles of food. The inspecting staff, who for the most part are promoted vaccinators, are not men of sufficient status and strength of character to be able to inspire confidence. They often share the spoils of the vaccinators and attempt to protect them, and it is only when some energetic Civil Surgeon or a Deputy Sanitary Commissioner brings to light their carelessness, neglect of duty or malpractices, that these men are roused to some activity for fear of losing their appointments. Notwithstanding these disadvantages, fairly good results are attained in districts where the executive officers give prompt and active help to the officers of this Department and where the inspecting staff are energetic and honest. Endeavours are being made to replace the worthless men as opportunities occur by properly qualified officers. Increase or decrease in vaccina- tions during 1907-08. Out of the 34 districts in Bengal including the Tributary States of Orissa, there was an increase of operations in 19, while there was. a decrease in 15 districts during the past year. The increase is specially notice- able in the following districts:( 3 ) refused vaccination. The improvement noticed in Jessore is said to be due to increasing appreciation by the public of the benefits of vaccination and to somewhat better public health of the past season, while the Civil Surgeon of Manbhum puts it down to( 4 ) of 1906-07 and 858.20 of 1905-06. The attention of Civil Surgeons has, as usual, been drawn to their responsibility in the matter of infant vaccination in towns wherever the protection is inadequate. Recess work. 6. During the recess or non-working season of 1907-08, 187,735 opera- tions were performed, chiefly in connection with small-pox epidemics and the up-keep of lymph for emergencies, against 162,966 of 1906-07 and 118,937 of 1905-06. The average of the triennial period under review was 156,546, against 162,787 of 1903-05. With a large rise in the mortality from small-pox during the last two years a much larger number of operations during the recess season might be reasonably looked for, but in many cases the deep-rooted prejudice of the people stands in the way. It is generally found, specially among the rural population, that when a person gets small-pox none of the household would accept vaccination until the patient is cured, and this helps the spread of the contagion. Such being the case, it is satisfactory to notice that through the active assistance of Rai Mani Lall Singh Roy Bahadur, an influential zamindar in the Burdwan district, a large number of revaccinations were done in his zamindari as well as in several other places, where small-pox was prevalent. This is the second year that this zamindar has been of great help to the subordinate officers of this Department in carrying on vaccination and in their realising the vaccinators fees. Six-puncture vaccination. 7. During 1907-08, 817,428 successful primary operations were per- formed in six points, against 793,834 of 1906-07 and 730,800 of 1905-06. The number of revaccin- ations was 17,813, against 13,049 of 1906-07 and 6,336 of 1905-06. The average of the triennial period in primary vaccination and revaccination was 780,687 and 12,399, against 617,175 and 9,002 of the previous epoch. There was thus an increase of 163,512 successful primary and 3,397 successful revaccination cases. Factory and tea garden vac- cination. 8. During the past year the total number of primary and revaccination operations performed in factories and tea gardens in Bengal was 4,279 and 11,421, against 3,920 and 1,386 respectively, in 1906-07 and 3,813 and 1,745 in 1905-06. The ratio of success in primary and revaccination cases was 95.02 and 78.92, against 98.44 and 42.92 respectively during 1906-07 and 95.59 and 37.30 during the year before.

The total average cost of vaccination in Bengal for the triennial period under review was Rs. 1,78,233-5-2, against Rs. 1,38,928-13-9 of 1903-05, the cost of each successful vaccination being 1 anna 6 pie, against 1 anna 5 pie. The increase of cost during the period under review as compared with the previous epoch is due principally to increase of pay of the inspecting staff owing to revision of the scale of their salary sanctioned by Government, the grant of grain compensation allowance, increased expenditure in travelling and contingencies owing to increase of work and the inclusion of of the cost of the districts of Sambalpur and some of the Tributary States which was excluded from the previous report as the necessary figures were not available. Out of the total average cost of vaccination as shown above, Rs. 7,943 were contributed by District Boards, Rs. 8,035 by Native States, and Rs. 219 from other sources, the corresponding figures for the preceding triennial period being Rs. 3,575, Rs. 2,235, and Rs. 212 respectively.

( 5 ) Diagram illustrating death-rates from small-pox, and degree of protection afforded. 10. The following diagram illustrates the death-rates from small-pox in each district with side by side the proportion of population protected against the disease by vaccination during the past seven years :( 7 ) Deaths from small-pox. 11. During the past year the total number of deaths from small-pox in the Province was 31,614, against 23,543 of 1906-07 and 12,090 of 1905-06, the ratio of deaths per 1,000 of the population being .59, against .43 and .22 of 1906-07 and 1905-06. The largest number of deaths was recorded in the districts of Gaya (3,987), Patna (2,758), Bhagalpur (2,627), Puri (2,284), Monghyr (2,074), 24-Parganas (1,950), Midnapore (1,456), Shahabad (1,400,) Balasore (1,347), Sonthal Parganas (1,196), Murshidabad (1,147), Burdwan (1,099), Birbhum (926), Calcutta (812), Purnea (772), Hooghly (751), Saran(719), Champaran (698), and Cuttack (614), while the mortality was lowest in the districts of Darjeeling (9), Khulna (65), Singhbhum (78), Sambalpur (93), and Palamau (93). Epidemic outbreaks of small-pox in a district have a sort of periodicity, it being more or less prevalent in epidemic form once in five years. The only means of eradicating the disease is the introduction of the Compulsory Vaccination Act throughout the Province, which under present circumstances is quite out of the question. Out of 31,614 persons who succumbed to this disease as noted above, 13,515 were reported as protected by vaccination and 11,943 unprotected, while in 6,156 cases nothing could be ascertainad. These figures being reported by chaukidars, cannot be relied on as accurate. Animal Vaccination Depôts. 12. In the Animal Vaccination Depôts at Calcutta and Darjeeling, the average number of calves vaccinated during the period under report was 1,438 and 223 respectively, against 795 and 223 of the previous triennial period. The average quantity of lanoline paste in grains manufactured was 278,340 and 67,801 respectively against 127,243 and 50,245 during 1903-1905. The increased outturn of the Calcutta Depôt is due to the abolition of arm-to-arm vaccination and the general introduction of lanoline lymph vaccination in the districts of the Presidency, Burdwan, and Orissa Divisions under Government. order No. 2977S., dated the 30th December 1905. But the lymph supply of the Darjeeling Depôt is almost stationary, as it is not capable of further extension. For this reason I submitted a proposal to Government last year to start another vaccination Depôt at Ranchi with a view to extend the lymph supply of the Bihar and Chota Nagpur districts with the ultimate object of supplanting arm-to arm vaccination altogether in those regions as quickly as possible. The question has been kept in abeyance, as it is intended to introduce a new and more expeditious method of lymph preparation, which, if successful, might obviate the necessity of constructing a new depôt. This matter is at present under my consideration. During the year 1906 07 there was a failure in the lymph supply of the Darjeeling Depôt owing to deterioration of the quality of the lymph. This caused much inconvenience, especially as there was at the time an epidemic outbreak of small-pox in Darjeeling. Prompt measures were, however, adopted to re-establish the lymph, but it was not until a new strain of lymph was introduced which had lately arrived from England and which had been rendered more potent by passage through rabbits that the lymph was brought to a high standard of efficiency. Captain D. Munro, I.M.S., Officiating Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Bengal and Orissa Circle, by introducing the routine method of passing the lymph frequently through rabbits, both in the Calcutta and the Darjeeling Depôts, has ensured the quality of the lymph remaining good. He has also introduced the custom of testing the prepared paste on rabbits so as to ensure the lymph being potent when issued from the depôt. During the past year a series of experiments was conducted by Captain Munro, I.M.S., to test the efficacy of the two different kinds of lymph, viz., lanoline lymph and glycerinated lymph, and he was impressed with the superiority of the latter variety. I quote below two extracts from Captain Munro's reports on the experiments, as they may be of interest:( 8 ) of tubes 10, 11, and 12 which gave 100 per cent. success in children, and a powerful reaction in 1-000 dilution on the rabbit. It seems then as if glycerinated lymph were not unsuitable for Bengal owing to the climate, as in an ordinary way it would not be required to stand such a severe test as in these experiments. As lymph it is obviously more suitable than the lanolinated variety, for (1) it contains few or no organisms and inflamed arms should never occur as they do with lanolinated lymph; (2) it need not be used in such a hurry. When lanolinated lymph is used too long after its preparation it is overgrown with extraneous organisms and the virus is weakened. Many failures in vaccination occur from this cause. The maximum period I can find record of, which has occurred between the issue of lymph from the Calcutta Depôt and its use is five weeks. The results were unsatisfactory. Glycerinated lymph would be at about its best five weeks after preparation, and is probably potent even longer. These experiments, to be complete, should have gone on until the lymph was found to be losing its potency. I fixed six weeks as the period of the experi- ments, partly to suit my own convenience, and partly because this is about the maximum period which might elapse before the use of the lymph, supposing it were issued after a fortnight's storage when the glycerine has commenced its preservative action and the virus is potent. &quot; The tubes I experimented on were not capillary tubes, but ordinary small glass tubes with corks, such as are in use at present for issuing lanolinated lymph. They proved very satisfactory. &quot; With regard to cost I have not worked out the figures exactly, but glycerine is cheaper than lanolin, and a higher dilution is used. If cold storage were used, the expenses would, of course, be heavier. I am aware that glycerinated lymph is always stored in the cold, usually in the ice-box, but the success of these experiments is to me so striking that I am of opinion that cold storage may be found to be unnecessary. Anyway glycerinated lymph, with or without cold storage, might be given a trial in Bengal in some selected area, say a small district, and I shall be surprised if the results are not worth it. &quot; I have the honour to give below the results of comparison made between glycerinated and lanolinated lymphs prepared on the same day as to their bacteriological purity after being for various times at 37° C., and should be obliged if you would add this as a supplement to my ' Report of experiments as to the effects of heat on glycerinated calf lymph' forwarded to you under cover of my No. 329S., dated 26th June 1907:( 9 ) success under each of these methods of vaccination was 99.01, 98.59, and 98.99 respectively, against 99.08, 98.25, and 99.13 of 1906-07 and 98.92, 96.57, and 99.21 of 1905-06. The number of revaccinations under each of these processes of vaccination was 4,704, 107,697, and 53,029 with a success of 74.70, 64.77, 75.73 per cent. respectively, against 5,718, 96,801, and 59,778 with a success of 66.73, 56.29, and 77.75 during 1906-07 and 6,680, 98,861, and 31,064 with a success of 58.81, 53.98, and 78.02 during 1905-06. Supply of lymph to the Nepal Durbar. 14. During 1907-08 one hundred and ten grains of lymph were supplied from the Darjeeling Animal Vaccination Depôt to the Nepal Darbar. Seven hundred and seventy grains were also supplied to the Sikkim State from the same depôt. The results are reported to have been satisfactory. The average quantity of lymph supplied annually to the Nepal Durbar and the Sikkim State during the triennial period under review was 280 and 1,003 grains respectively, against 420 and 621 grains during the previous triennial epoch. Inspections. 15. During the past year the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners of the Bengal and Orissa, and of the Bihar and Chota Nagpur Circles inspected each 10,375 and 57,351 cases respectively. The percentage of successful operations to total number of operations inspected by them was 98.53 and 96.62 respectively. The amount of work done by Captain Ross is very creditable. He thoroughly examined the work of the vaccinators and the subordinate inspecting staff in addition to multifarious other duties. Among Civil Surgeons one, viz., the Civil Surgeon of Sonthal Parganas, inspected over 10,000 operations, 17 between 5,000 and 10,000, 11 between 2,000 and 5,000, 4 between 1,000 and 2,000, and 1 less than 1,000. The percentage of success in primary and revaccination cases inspected by them was 98.74 and 68.71 respectively. Of the subordinate staff, 16 District Inspectors of Vaccination inspected more than 50 per cent. of the primary operations in their respective charges, 6 between 40 and 50 per cent., and 9 between 20 and 40 per cent., and 1 only 6 per cent. In 12 districts the Sub-Inspectors of Vaccination inspected more than 80 per cent. of the primary operations performed in their jurisdictions, in 21 districts between 50 and 80 per cent., and in 1 below 50 per cent. The percentage of success reported by the Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors of Vaccination was 98.65 and 98.82 in primary cases, and 59.54 and 67.37 in revaccination, the success reported by the vaccinators in the returns being 98.83 and 68.56 respectively under the above heads. Suitable notice has, as usual, been taken departmentally of the inadequate inspections performed by the subordinate inspecting staff. General remarks. 16. I am glad to record that the period under review has witnessed the introduction of several useful reforms into the Department which have tended to better work and to greater efficiency. The chief among these are( 10 ) (c) General introduction of antiseptic vaccination throughout the Province.STATISTICAL RETURNS. G

F. C. CLARKSON, LIEUT.-COL., I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal. B. S. PressMUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. SANITATION. DARJEELING, THE 29TH JUNE 1908. RESOLUTION No. 561T.( 2 ) total deaths in the whole Province. From the Cuttack district alone, 31,805 deaths were reported, of which three-fourths occurred during the months of August, September and October, when the insanitary conditions that super- vened on the heavy floods must have largely conduced to the spread of the disease. The Lieutenant-Governor notices with satisfaction that the treatment of wells with permanganate of potash was successfully adopted in many parts of the Province and that the people are gradually learning to appreciate this method of disinfection. 5. Plague.( 3 ) at the Sanitary Commissioner's suggestion, undertaken anti-malarial measures, in many cases with useful results. 7. The report of the Drainage Committee, appointed by Government to investigate the prevalence and causes of malaria and to what extent it is due to obstructed drainage, was received during the year, and the orders of Government passed thereon. Action has already been taken in respect of most of the recommendations made. The Government of India has just sanctioned the deputation of a special I.M.S. officer for the purpose of conduct- ing a systematic and continuous enquiry into the causes of malaria and the extent to which it prevails; while the question of creating a special engineering division for the examination of the drainage conditions of specified areas is still under the consideration of that Government. The Lieutenant-Governor has sanctioned a scheme prepared by the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals for the deputation of a large number of selected Civil Hospital Assistants during the fever season to distribute medical aid in specially malarious tracts. A leaflet containing instructions for self-treatment with quinine, and stating where the pice packets can be obtained, has recently been widely distributed in English and in the vernaculars. His Honour desires to invite the attention of the Sani- tary Commissioner to the account, given in paragraph 63 of the annual Report on the Jails in this Province for 1907, of the excellent results achieved in the jails by administering doses of quinine during the fever season. Sir Andrew Fraser considers that this and other experience point to the expediency of the Sanitary Department making an earnest effort to popularise as widely as possible the use of quinine as a febrifuge amongst the mass of the people. The question of adopting special measures in this direction will be taken up separately in consultation with the Sanitary Commissioner and the Inspector- General of Civil Hospitals. 8.

THE following are brief notes on Vaccination in Bengal for the year 1908- 1909. Officer in charge of the Depart- ment. 2. I was in charge of the Department through- out the year. Bengal and Orissa Circle.( 2 ) food-grains which prevailed in the district and the failure of the crops, it is doubtful whether the result would have been even as good as it has been, had not the District Magistrate taken a personal interest in vaccination and used his influence- through his subordinates and presidents of pancheyts in inducing the people to accept the prophylactic. In Burdwan, the increase is said to be due to greater healthiness of the latter part of the year, which induced parents to offer their children freely for vaccination, and to the great influence exercised by Rai Mani Lall Singh Roy Bahadur, Zemindar of Chakdighi, who for the third year in succession materially helped in carrying on vaccination and in realizing the vaccinator's fee not only in his own zemindary but in those of others as well. His example may be followed by other loyal Zemindars. In Balasore the increase is due to the normal strength of staff of the district being maintained, whereas in 1907-08,some of the vaccinators deserted their posts and hence less work was done in that year. As regards the Tributary States of Orissa, no explanation of the increase nor any details as to the age of the vaccinated: have been furnished. The decrease in the districts of Darbhanga, Ranchi and Hazaribagh is explained by the prevailing scarcity which compelled the labouring classes to leave their homes for search of employment elsewhere. In Bhagalpur an increased number of operations was performed in 1907-08 in connection with the suppression of small-pox outbreaks, while during the past year, the mortality from this disease was much less and hence there was a. smaller number of vaccinations. Vaccination in municipalities. 5. In Calcutta, 82,079 operations were performed during the year against31,155 in 1907-08. The large increase of 50,924 is due to the severe prevalence of small-pox in the town. In muffasil municipalities, dispensaries, etc., the number of cases amounted to 142,781 against 130,947 of the previous year, showing an increase of 11,834. The average work of a vaccinator in muffasil municipalities was 819 against 776, while that of licensed, District Board and all other paid vaccinators was 1,022, 1,979, and 1,475, against 963, 1,879 and 1,436 respectively of the previous year. Protection afforded to infants. 6. During the- year under review, out of 1,502,990, the estimatednumber of infants under one year available for vaccination, 8,51,110, that is 566.72 per thousand, were successfully vaccinated, against 525.42 of the previous year. Again there has been an increase in the percentage of successful cases which is satisfactory. In 22 districts (against 19 of the previous year) viz., Palmau, Sambalpur, Murshidabad, Ranchi, Cuttack, Bhagalpore, Darjeeling, Sonthal Parganas, Nadia,. Midnapore, Puri, Hazaribagh,. Gaya, Burdwan, Manbhum, Political States of Singhbhum, Muzaffarpur, Monghyr, Darbhanga, Jessore, Champaran, and Purnea,.the protection was over 500 per mille, while the lowest rate, viz., 308.99 per mille in Bankura far exceeded the figure of the previous year, viz., 236.34 in the same district. It is most satisfactory that Puri which was most backward in vaccination, specially as regards that of infants under one year of age, should suddenly show such wonderful progress, but this is due to the hearty co operations of the District Magistrate, Mr. Hamilton, with the Civil Surgeon in the work, as well as to the efforts of the Special Inspector of Vaccination for Orissa who infused new energy among the staff and succeeded by tact and persuasion in inducing parents to offer their children for vaccination even in villages which had always resisted it. The protection afforded to infants in municipalities is shown in Appendix VII attached to the report. It will be seen that 942.30 per mille of the surviv- ing infant population was protected during the year against 833.95 of the previous year, which is satisfactory. The attention of the Civil Surgeons has, as usual, been drawn to their responsibility in the matter of infant vaccination in towns wherever the protection is inadequate. Recess work. 7. During the recess or non-working season of the past year, 181,243operations were performed in connection with small-pox epidemics and the up-keep of lymph for emergencies against 187,735 of 1907-08. Six-puncture vaccination. 8. The total number of successful primary and re-vaccination operationsin six-points was 825,233 and 19,670 respectively against 817,428 and 17,813 respectively of the previous years.

( 3 ) Factory and tea garden vacci- nation. 9. In factories and tea gardens, 4,348 operations were performed ofwhich 2,945 were primary and 1,403 re-vacci- nation cases. The ratio of success in primary and re-vaccination cases was 98.91 and 42.05 respectively. Cost of and contribution towards vaccination. 10. The cost of vaccination during the year was Rs. 2,17,720-14-9against Rs. 2,03,667-6 of the previous year. The average cost of each successful case of vaccination was one anna and. seven pies against one anna eight pies of the previous year. The District Boards, Native States, and Cantonments, Dispensaries, &c., contributed Rs. 10,856-13-7, Rs. 12,161-13-0 and Rs. 189-10-4 against Rs. 9,969-5-6, Rs. 8,472-1-3 and Rs. 297-12 respectively of the previous year. Diagram illustrating death rates from small-pox and degree of protection afforded. 11. The diagram facing this page illustrates the death-rates from small- pox in each district, the proportion of population protected against the disease by vaccination during the past seven years being shown side by side :( 4 ) Of the subordinate inspecting staff, 13 District Inspectors of Vaccination inspected more than 50 per cent. of the primary operations performed in their respective charges, 10 between 40 and 50 per cent., 7 between 20 to 40 per cent., and 2 below 20 per cent. In 13 districts the Sub-Inspectors of Vaccination inspected more than 80 per cent. of the primary operations in their jurisdictions, in 19 districts between 50 and 80 per cent. and in 2 below 50 per cent. Suitable notice has, as usual, been taken departmentally of the inadequate amount of inspection performed by the subordinate inspecting staff. General remarks. 17. There is nothing special to note in respect of vaccination during thepast year except that further experiments were carried on with glycerinated lymph manufactured in the Central Animal Vaccination Depôt, Calcutta, in the districts of Gya, Murshidabad, Serampore, Midnapore, 24-Parganas and Howrah. The result achieved was very encouraging, the Civil Surgeons of Howrah, Gya and Midnapore recommending its substitution for lanoline vaccination paste at present in use. Its only drawback is that it deteriorates in transmission through heat and requires careful handling by the vaccinators and does not retain its efficacy so long as the lanoline paste. I shall, however, give this lymph a further trial exclusively in two or three selected districts during the present year, and if successful, the question of its general introduction will be considered. By introducing the routine method of passing the lymph frequently through rabbits, both in the Calcutta and the Darjeeling Depôts, the potency of the lymph was well maintained throughout the year. Another satisfactory feature of the year was the considerable impetus given to vaccination in the districts of Puri and Cuttack, by the appoint- ment of the Special Inspector of Vaccination for Orissa, who being a specially trained officer succeeded with tact and energy in overcoming oppo- sition to vaccination and in inducing the people of the tracts affected with small-pox and other areas where vaccination had always been resisted in accep- ting the prophylactic. This had the effect of cutting short the epidemic in Puri where the mortality was appreciably reduced. Another very highly encouraging result was the marked increase in infant protection in the districts of Cuttack and Puri, specially in the latter district. The appointment of the Special Inspector is thus justified and it will be desirable to retain his services till a thorough protection is given to the people of Orissa and they are made to appreciate the benefits of vaccination. During the past year progress was retarded in certain districts owing to the inability of the poor to pay the vaccinator's fees, and applications were received from the Civil Surgeons of Midnapore, Champaran, Murshidabad, Bhagalpore and Durbhanga for grants from Government to compensate the vaccinators for the loss sustained by them. But on a representation being made to Government in the Midnapore case it was suggested that the District Board might be asked to consider the ques- tion of contribution to some of the most deserving vaccinators. The matter has accordingly been referred to the District Boards concerned for consi- deration. In the case of Durbhanga where the District Board have declined to sanction a grant, I am in communication with the local officers with a view to approach Government, if necessary, for a grant. 18.

Cholera.( 3 ) average of the five years 1903( 4 ) other claims, if, as has been proposed in some schemes which have come before Government, they are financed for the greater part from General Revenues. 15. The Sanitary Commissioner instances the cases of Howrah, the Subur- ban area in Calcutta and Berhampur, as illustrating the need of efficient drainage concurrently with the introduction of a filtered water-supply. In the absence of proper drains it may not be possible to dispose of the waste water brought into the towns, and increased mortality from fever may result. The working of the various septic tanks which have now been constructed in different localities, particularly in the mills along the banks of the Hooghly, has received special attention, and an Inspector has recently been appointed to inspect the installations, with particular reference to their size and construction, and the proper sterilisation of the effluents from them. 16.
