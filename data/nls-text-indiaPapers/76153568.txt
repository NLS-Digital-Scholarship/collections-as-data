Two successive Superintendents of this Department being away on Military duty and there being no whole-time officer available to replace them, I held charge of the office of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, throughout the year in addition to my own duties as Prinicipal of the Veterinary College. All touring duties were performed by the Deputy Superintendent. 2. The Deputy Superintendent, Babu Sarat Chandra Pal, was on tour for 118 days and travelled 6,603 miles by rail, 191 miles by road and 855 miles by steamer. He visited most of the dispensaries and inspected and checked the work of the Veterinary Assistants in charge. He attended two outbreaks of rinderpest at. the Rangpur Dairy Farm and two outbreaks of surra at the Dacca and Comilla towns, respectively. He was deputed to the Garo Hills for the purpose of procuring stud bulls. He also translated into Bengali Major Walker's manual on "Some Diseases of Cattle in India." 3. During the year 1 Veterinary Assistant, viz., Babu U. N. Sarkar. volunteered his services to the Military Department and is now on active service in Mesopotamia. Of the 7 Veterinary Assistants who joined the Military Department, during the previous year, one, viz., Babu Jugman Singh of Darjeeling, returned home on leave and has since died. The total number of Veterinary Assistants of this province now under Military employ is therefore seven. Part I.2 Equine. 8. Glanders.3 Twenty-nine thousand seven hundred and eighteen animals were inocu- lated in 225 outbreaks as against 41,300 animals in 314 outbreaks as per details below:4 32. Several applications from District Boards were received during the year for the supply of good stud bulls. An attempt was made to procure them from the Garo Hills, but without success. Both the Deputy Superin- tendent of this Department and an officer of the Agricultural Department who were deputed for the purpose visited all the centres in these hills where bulls were said to be available but found none of them suitable for breeding. 33. As reported in the previous year, the staff of this Department are trying their best to arouse interest in cattle breeding amongst the people. In certain districts there are indications of a desire amongst the zamindars to interest themselves in this matter. Babu Narendra Nath Lahiri, a zamindar of Gaibandha, made a free gift of one crossbred Hissar bull to the dispensary there. Rai Lalit Mohan Singh Bahadur, zamindar of Chakdighi, Burdwan, is reported to have been doing good work in distributing good cows and bull calves from his own stock to his tenants. Some of the zamindars in the district of Nadia have agreed to maintain good bulls if supplied free of cost. 34. Three bull calves5 42. During the year two Veterinary Assistants died, two dismissed, one resigned, and seven Veterinary Assistants were under military employ. There were thus 12 vacancies in the cadre which could not be tilled up for want of men. Besides these there were a number of leave vacancies for which no substitutes were available. The new posts sanctioned during the year could not also be entertained for the same reason. 43. Only three new graduates were received during the year and they were all absorbed in filling up the old vacancies. 44. Deputy Superintendent.TABLE II.
