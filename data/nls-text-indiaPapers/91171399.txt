REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE HYDERABAD ASSIGNED DISTRICTS, FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1872-73. BY R. T. ABBOTT, ESQR., M. D., SUPERINTENDENT OF VACCINATION, BERARS. HYDERABAD: PRINTED AT THE RESIDENCY GOVERNMENT PRESS, 1873.
INDEX TO VACCINATION REPORT FOR THE YEAR 187211 INDEX CHAPTER III.No. 651 OF 1873-74. FROM CAPTAIN G. H. TREVOR, Second Assistant Resident, Hyderabad, To THE SANITARY COMMISSIONER, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. DATED HYDERABAD RESIDENCY, the 3rd June 1873. SIR, THE Resident in thanking you for your Report on Vaccination in Berar during the year 1872-73, which he has perused with much interest, does not think it necessary to enter into any detailed remarks on the results exhibited. He highly appreciates your endeavours to show honest work, though they rather detract from the credit brought by the figures of previous years. It is annoying that Vaccinators will ' cook' returns, but it is satis- factory to detect and punish such conduct. 2. The main points of the Report may be thus stated :( 2 ) gence, wealth, and Bombay Brahmins, have chiefly accumulated, and it will be almost a reproach to the Educational Department if they continue to occupy the last place in future Vaccination Reports. The school-master . ought to be able to help the vaccinator. 3. The cost of vaccine operations, it is observed, rose from Rupees 10,973-15-9 in 1871 to Rupees 14,881-14 in the year under report. The increase of Rupees 3,907-14-3 is attributed to more Superintendents on higher pay and more vaccinators having been employed. The average cost of each successful vaccine operation was 7, against 6 annas in the pre- vious year. 4. Mr. Saunders notes with satisfaction and will ask the Commission- ers to convey his thanks to the patels named by you as having been con- spicuous for the aid they have rendered in promoting vaccination. He will also recognize in the way you suggest the services of Ajaj Hoosein, 1st class Vaccinator, viz., by conferring on him a grant of Rupees 30. The eleven Tehsildars whom you mark as deserving of special notice will, it is to be hoped, arouse the emulation of those in whose tehsils the tale of vaccinations is insufficient. It is to be regretted that there has been a falling off, as com- pared with 1871-72, in the tehsils of Ballapoor, Khamgaon, Moortizapoor, Julgaon. The same may be said of Mulkapoor, Akote and Oomrawuttee, I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, G. H. TREVOR, Second Assistant Resident.
CHAPTER I. GENERAL. Principles on which vaccination is car ried on detailed in Report for 1871-72. The principles on which the Vaccination Depart- ment in Berar is worked are fully set forth in last year's report. Measures already reported, not re-pro- duced here. 2. It is needless to reproduce here the means adopted to improve the scholastic attainments of the vaccinators during last recess, or to record the measures taken to prove the effi- ciency of the candidates who gained admittance into the department to make the number of vaccinators up to the full sanctioned complement, as these have already been reported to the Resident in my letter No. 3015, dated 22nd October 1872, and he has been pleased to accord his satisfaction to the steps taken. Tuition to be again carried on this year at Akolah. 3. I propose this year also to have the establish- ment at Akolah in July, where its members will be placed under tuition, in the hope that in a few years I will have a staff of vaccina- tors who are not only up to their work as vaccinators but who are possessed of a tolerably fair education. They may then be expected to be better able to explain to the people of Berar the benefits of vaccination, and to have more influence among them for good. Means of check already reported. More European supervision required. 4. I have also in my letter No. 1489, dated 12th June 1872, explained the means taken to check the correctness of the returns submitted by the vaccinators. These measures of check have been brought more into force in the year under report than they were in its predecessor, and it is to be hoped that next year the supervision of the native Superintendents will be of a more scrutinizing character than it was this year. While on this subject I must, however, record as my opinion, based on some experience now, that there is not enough of European supervision in which alone we can place positive assurance. It can scarcely be expected that, with so many departments to direct and supervise, I can bestow as much time and attention on vaccination as the importance of the subject demands. A vaccinator suspected of fudging, and found out. Punishment awarded. 5. When last year's work was undergoing ex- amination, I had reason to suspect that one of the vaccinators had fudged his return, but the Superintendent so solemnly assured me that he had personally examined nearly all the work of the vaccinator that I was compelled at the time to let the figures pass as correct. My doubts were not, however, removed, and on enquiry I found they were correct. The Superintendent has not since made his appearance, and the vaccinator has been dismissed. Means taken to find out falsification of returns, results of. 6. With a view to finding out whether any other vaccinators had deceived me, I this year chang- ed the circles of a good many in the hope that the men now posted to them would tell of their predecessor's misdeeds, if there were any to report; but from only 3 places were any reported, and the wrong entries made were so few that I have considered a fine in each case to be sufficient punishment. Cases of falsification in this year's work found out. 7. This year with more Superintendents than I had last year, the work of the vaccinators has been
( 2 ) somewhat more perfectly tested, and 3 cases of fudging have been reported by the Superintendents. One defaulter, an old vaccinator, and one who has been more than once punished, has been dismissed; a second, a new hand, has also been dis- charged; and the third, as only 4 or 5 errors were found, has been fined. The fudged figures have been eliminated from the returns. Difficulty in working the department. 8. Any one who has experience in the work- ing of a department like this must know the numer- ous difficulties one has to contend with. They need not be mentioned here. Suf- fice it to say that I endeavour to my utmost, as far as time will permit, to contend with them, and feeling satisfied on this point, I rather bring the short-comings of the department to notice than leave this duty as a legacy to my successor who may any day step in. Establishment at commencement of season, sickness of. 9. At the beginning of the working season, the full sanctioned staff was entertained; one, how- ever, fell ill, and was unable to join his circle. It was so late in the season when I heard this that 1 did not consider it worthwhile to fill up his post. Two of the native Superintendents and two vaccinators were so indisposed for a considerable time as to materially affect their work. Punishments awarded. 10. During the season, one man took french leave, because casual leave would not be granted him. Two vaccinators were dismissed, one for bad character and the other for falsification of returns, and 16 were otherwise punished as follows:( 3 ) circle 730 children were vaccinated, of these the Medical Officer verified 207 suc- cessful and 41 unsuccessful cases. And in the Ellichpur circle 480, of which the Civil Surgeon writes:( 4 ) by the vaccinators posted to them in the year under report, as compared with its predecessor, are shown in the following form :( 5 ) Castes of those vaccinated. 20. The number of persons vaccinated accord- ing to caste is :( 6 ) 25. The following is an abstract of that statement:( 7 ) CHAPTER III. EXPENDITURE. STATEMENT No. III. Increased expenditure explained. 28. This statement shows the cost of the work- ing of the department during the year. It amounts to Rupees 14,881-14-0, as against Rupees 10,973-15-9 in its predecessor. The aver- age cost per each successful case in 1872-73 being 7 annas, and in 1871-72, 6 annas. The difference in excess in the year under report is accounted for thus :( 8 ) CHAPTER IV. COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS YEARS. STATEMENT No. IV. Results of 5 years shown. 31. This statement shows, at a glance, the working of the department for the past 5 years. 32. The following is an abstract of it:( 9 ) Some details of examination of each- circle. 36. The results of my inspections may be gleaned from a perusal of the following statement:( 10 ) CHAPTER VI. CONCLUSION. Work done in each Tehsil. Tehsil- dars noticed. 37. In the following form I propose to show the work done in each Tehsil. The arrangement is made according to the Tehsils in which the average work per vaccinator employed is highest, and I think that it may be inferred that the Tehsildars of the places high up on list gave most assistance in this cause, and that lower down gave less : and I would wish especially to bring to the Resident's notice the Tehsildars of. the first 11 named Tehsils;( 11 ) the Patails that most of the work of the department is carried on, and for this reason I am anxious to enlist the good will of as many of them as possible:APPENDICES.

THE Commissioner's letter forwarding this report notices the main points of the work carried on by the Vaccination Department during the past year; and all that the Resident thinks it necessary to add is the assur- ance of his warm interest in that work, and of his confidence that the Dis- trict Officers will do their best to second the efforts which have been made by Doctor Abbott and his subordinates. 2. It is unfortunate that the total number of successful cases and the percentage of successful to unsuccessful cases were less than in the previous year. With reference to his remarks on the use of indifferent lymph and the non-arrival in proper time of the supply from England, Doctor Abbott will be requested to explain the cause of the delay adverted to, and to com- municate with the Deputy Inspector General of Hospitals, with a view to the prevention, if possible, of a similar delay in future. 3. The Resident concurs with the Commissioner in thinking that, on the whole, a fair amount of progress has been made during the year report- ed on, and that Doctor Abbott has controlled this branch of his duties with efficiency. (By Order.) G. H. TREVOR, Second Assistant Resident.
From the Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, to the First Assistant Resident, Hyderabad, (No. 1272).( 2 ) 10. The operations of this department cost Rupees 18,289, against Ru- pees 14,881 in the previous year, the increase being due to promotions and to additions to the establishment. A larger establishment and fewer subjects operated on raise the average cost of each successful case from 7 annas to 9 annas and 9 pie. 11. On the whole, although the results are not so favorable, the excuse which has been offered is a valid one, and as a supply of good lymph was not obtained until long after it was due, I think a fair amount of progress has been made during the year; and Doctor Abbott has, in my opinion, controlled his Department with efficiency. I have, &c., (Signed) W. NEMBHARD, Lieut-Col., Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts.
CHAPTER I. GENERAL. New Code of Vaccination Rules. 1. The new Code of Rules for the management of the vaccination department and the extension of the benefits of vaccination among the people of Berar, promised in last year's Report, was submitted; received the Resident's sanction; and came into operation in the beginning of this working season. Although the rules in this Code differ in many particulars from those previously in force, the general principles on which vaccination is carried on in Berar are the same. That is to say, we rely on the assistance of the Patails of villages, and through them, on the influence of the Civil Authorities to get children for us to vaccinate. In the absence of &quot; compulsory vaccination&quot; which, I conceive, it is not the wish of Government to introduce, and, there- fore, the advisability or otherwise of which is, in my mind, beyond discussion, I believe this is the best principle to work the department on, though there may be others by which, for the present, better results may possibly be pro- curable, but in the long run, it is doubtful if these would be as successful as the mode of procedure we follow here. Attendance of establishment at school at Akolah. 2. The members of the establishment, as in the previous year, were present at head-quarters during the months of July, August, and September, when they were instructed in general subjects, such as history, geography, arithmetic, &c., &c., so as to improve their educational attainments. Lymph supply. 3. The supply of lymph asked for did not arrive from England till after the season had commenced. I was therefore obliged to begin work with a small supply re- ceived from Bombay. This I did at Akolah, and as it increased sent out Vac- cinators to their various stations, but, as the lymph had in many instances to be sent long distances, when tried, it proved a failure, and, thus, retarded work at the beginning of the season. Had the supply of lymph from England arrived at the time I asked for it to reach me, it was my intention to have sent each Superintendent with his Vaccinators to the head-quarters of his district to begin work in the middle of September, so that by the 1st of October he would be able to send out some of his staff to work. Beginning in this way from several centres, there would not be so much delay in supplying each Vaccinator with lymph as when all had to be supplied from one place. I trust that the English lymph will reach me this year in time to carry out the above idea, as also because I have found that it apparently has in it( 2 ) Assistance in supervision promised. 4. It is only necessary casually to refer to my letter No. 2000, dated 15th August 1873, to the address of the 1st Assistant Resident, in which my views and opinions in regard to the administration of the department I have the honor to control are fully set forth, to show that they have been somewhat supported by the Resident, as he places at my disposal, for a few months of the year, during the vaccine season, the services of the Assistant Apothecary at Akolah, when they are not required elsewhere, to assist me in checking the work of the Superintendents of vaccination. Unfortunately, however, this year I was not able to avail myself of the services of Mr. Apothecary Pitts, as just at the time I required them, he was obliged to take up the appointment of an Officiat- ing Civil Surgeoncy, the permanent incumbent having taken ill, and being obliged to avail himself of leave. District Superintendents' work ex- amined by them. 5. In regard to the work of Superintendents. They have examined a very great deal more than in the previous year. I have therefore so much the more confidence in the figures which appear in this, than in any previous Report. Akolah District Superintendent. The Superintendent, Akolah district, visited 303 of the 359 villages in which work was carried on, and satisfied himself of the correctness of 1,838 of the 3,345 reported suc- cessful cases. Bassim. The Superintendent, Bassim district, visited 186 villages out of 329 in which vaccination was car- ried on, and verified 3,055 of the 4,996 cases recorded as &quot; successful.&quot; Buldanah. The Superintendent, Buldanah district, examin- ed the work in 283 of the 317 villages visited by Vaccinators in his district, and proved the &quot; success&quot; of 2,278 of 3,122 cases recorded as such. Oomraotee. The Superintendent, Oomraotee district, in- spected the work in 263 villages, leaving 154 un- visited, and verified 4,078 out of 6,019 reported &quot; successful&quot; cases. Ellichpur. The Superintendent, Ellichpur district, visited 212 of 214 villages in which operations were car- ried on, and verified 3,237 out of 3,798 reported &quot; successful&quot; cases. Woon. The Superintendent, Woon district, visited 316 of 540 villages in which vaccination was perform- ed and examined, and is satisfied with the correctness of 3,608 out of 6,231 reported &quot; successful&quot; cases. The Reporter's part in supervision of work. 6. I have not, of course, been able to examine even some of the work performed by all the Super- intendents. What I have done in this respect will be shown in a chapter further on in this report; and now that the recess is come, and I will have com- parative leisure in office, I propose, as 1 did last year, to call for some of the Patails' forms from each circle and compare them with the returns received, and, thus, in some way compensate for my inability to test the returns of all the Superintendents. Difficulties met with in working De- partment. 7. I don't suppose any one who has not had a department of this sort to superintend can have any idea of the trouble and annoyance a Superintendent has to contend against, and as I said last year, I repeat in this also, I do my best to contend against all difficulties as they arise, and strive to promote the interest of the department by getting as good work as I can; and, feeling satisfied on this point, when there are failures, I do not hesitate to record them.
( 3 ) Full establishment entertained. 8. The full establishment was entertained by appointing 9 new Vaccinators to fill up vacancies which existed from various causes at the beginning of the working season. Punishments inflicted on its members. 9. The following exhibits the punishments in- flicted during the working season, and the causes assigned for them in each case. FINED. Superintendent Woon( 4 ) Oomraotee head-quarters. The Civil Surgeon, Oomraotee, was Superin- tendent of the Jail in addition to his other duties till the middle of February, and for this reason, he says, was unable to examine much of the Vaccinator's work. He, however, frequently accompanied him to Oomraotee and to the hamlets which surround that city ; verified some of his work( 5 ) causing deaths to 8,326 people in 1873, and leaving it is impossible to say how many marked by the disease who have not been operated on. Thus, the number of individuals to be vaccinated is fewer than in the year 1872-73; and this explanation is, I think, supported by the fact that 31 per cent. of those vaccinated in the year under report were under 1 year of age, as against 17 per cent. of that age in the previous year, as the people do not like to have their very young children operated on ; (2) there is more supervision exercis- ed over the Vaccinators by the Superintendents, and they (the vaccinators) have not so many opportunities of fudging as previously; and (3) my order di- recting Vaccinators not to carry on operations in towns where there are Dispen- saries has also to a minor extent tended to reduce the number of vaccinations performed by the members of the department, but this should be made up for by a corresponding increase of &quot; dispensary vaccinations,&quot; which, however, does not appear in this report. Causes of increase in the number of &quot; unsuccessful&quot; cases. 16. The increase in the number of unsuccess- ful cases is attributable to the want of vitality in the lymph first used, and to better supervision on the part of the Superin- tendents : thus preventing false entries on the part of vaccinators, as is sup- ported by the &quot; unknown&quot; being fewer than in the year 1872-73.

If the results of the year, as compared with those of the previous one, are compared dis- trict by district, it will be found that the number of operations (successful only) increased in two districts and decreased in four. Thus, in the Ellichpur and Oomraotee districts they increased from 3,195 and 5,319 to 3,798 and to 6,764, respectively, whilst in the Bassim district there was a decrease of 685. In the Akolah district of 1,421. In the Woon district of 1,791, and in the Bul- danah district of 1,953 in the number of successful cases.
( 6 ) Sexes of those operated on, as com- pared with previous year. 19. The males operated on, as compared with females in the two years, are shown below:( 7 ) Castes most difficult to get to vacci- nate. 22. The Mahomedans are the most difficult set of people to induce to get their children vaccinated : next come the Rajpoots. Unless vaccination is made compulsory, it will take many years before these castes of people will get all their children vaccinated. My presence in a village has its influence with most castes of people to induce them to get their children vaccinated, but with Mahomedans and Rajpoots I have no influence. Their words are sweet: so far as pro- mises go, they cannot be excelled; but I fail to get what I most desire( 8 ) Benefits of Vaccination as shown by Superintendent, Akola District. 26.

Although I had six Vaccinators in the Mel- ghât talook of the Ellichpur district for a few months, I have purposely omitted to show the work done by them in State- ment No. II., as this wild tract of country is inhabited chiefly by the aboriginals' class who are not &quot; under registration;&quot; and I conceive it right to keep the vaccination figures, which appear in the annual Reports, in such a form that, at any time, without delay, they can be read with those pertaining to the &quot; Registration Circles.&quot; Time not yet come to vaccinate throughout the year. 30. The time has not yet come, so far as I can judge, for carrying on vaccination throughout the year in Berar : when it does come, and the proposal is carried out, I think it will be well if it is first introduced by Civil Surgeons at their head-quarters' Dispensaries where there may be less difficulties to encounter in carrying out &quot; arm to arm&quot; vaccination than in the wilds of the districts. CHAPTER III. EXPENDITURE. Statement No. III. increased expen- diture explained. 31. This statement shows the cost of the work- ing of the department during the year. It amounts to Rupees 18,289-2-8, as against Rupees 14,881-14-0 in the previous year, showing an increase of expenditure of Rupees 3,407-4-8, which was anticipated in last year's Report, and as the department grows older, it may be expected that it will increase year by year till the higher grades among Superintendents and Vaccinators are all filled up.

( 11 ) Instances of the benefit of vaccination appreciated. 35. Scattered instances, however, have come to my notice of the people fully appreciating the benefits of vaccination. Thus, in the village of Donopore, Tillara Circle, Akolah district, when the vaccinator went there this season, the mothers at once brought their children to be vaccinated, and two who were not present during the vaccinator's stay followed him to the next village he halted at( 12 ) ent man, and dismissed by me when I visited his circle, and one Vaccinator in the Maikur talook was fined by me for laziness when I inspected his work.

On the whole, although there are a good many complaints by Superintendents and Vaccin- ators against Patails for not rendering assistance, and some of them to my knowledge well grounded, I am satisfied that they are more willing to render assistance to the Department than heretofore, and the people, though slowly, are beginning to understand the benefits of vaccination.

The average cost per individual vaccinat- ed is Rupees 0-9-9, as compared with an average of Rupees 0-11-11 in the previous five years. But this Rupees 0-9-9 is high, as compared with the cost in the previous year, for reasons which have already been fully discussed, and need therefore be only briefly stated here. Increased pay to some members of establishment. Fewer people to operate on, and, conse- quently, fewer operations. At the same time, it must be said that if the preju- dices of the opponents to the department and of the &quot;lukewarms&quot; were over- come, the average cost per person vaccinated should not be as high as it is this year. This time is, I fear, still a long way off.

TABLE OF CONTENTS OF VACCINATION REPORT, FOR THE YEAR 1874-75. CHAPTER I.II TABLE OF CONTENTS. Para. CHAPTER IV.No. 610 OF 1875-76. Remarks by the Resident on the Vaccination Report of the Haidarabad As- signed Districts during the year 1874. THE Resident concurs with the Commissioner in the remarks made in his letter forwarding this report. It is clear that more and better work has been done during the year under review; and this is mainly due to the zeal and judgment with which Doctor Abbott has superintended the work of his subordinates. The co-operation of the civil officers must also be acknow- ledged. District Officers will doubtless bear in mind that in using their influence for the promotion of vaccination they not only perform a duty of the highest utility and true philanthropy, but also that their example in this, as in other matters of public administration, probably guides many of their subordinates and hundreds of persons possessed of local interest in different parts of their districts. 2. The small rewards recommended by the Superintendent for those vaccinators who have specially exerted themselves are sanctioned. (By Order.) G. H. TREVOR, HAIDARABAD RESIDENCY, Second Assistant Resident. The 14th September, 1875.
From the Commissioner, Haidarabad Assigned Districts, to the First Assist- ant Resident, Haidarabad, (No. 1733.)( 2 ) Mahomedans, Rajputs, and Brahmins, were the greatest obstructers. Operations were least successful in September (possibly from the lymph, as the English supply did not arrive till the end of that month), and were most suc- cessful in November, December and January. 7. The total cost of the operations was:CHAPTER I. PRELIMINARY. Where rules under which vacci- nation is carried on are to be found. One new rule required. 1. Vaccination is carried on under the Rules published in Residency Orders No. 24, dated 20th December 1873. As, however, considerable diffi- culty is frequently experienced in examining the work done in many places owing to the patail forms being lost or destroyed, it is necessary that copies of these should be kept in book form by the Patwa- ris of villages; and I shall feel obliged if orders to this effect are issued. Establishment changes in. 2. The establishment was the same at the beginning of the season as in the previous year, with the following exceptions:( 2 ) Operations when commenced, and where extended to. 6. Operations were commenced at Akola in July with lymph procured from the Central Pro- vinces. At first the vesicles produced were of full size and good appearance, but from the 15th of August till towards the end of September they were puny, and although from &quot;arm to arm&quot; vaccina- tion was alone resorted to, much difficulty was experienced in keeping up a small supply of lymph. Fortunately at this juncture, lymph from England reached me, and between the two supplies, I was able to start vaccination in the remaining five districts (as well as at several places along the line of rail) which enter into the formation of the province, so that on the 1st of October, when the season commenced, there was a supply of lymph in each centre of operation. Importance of verification of cases. 7. As I have before insisted on the impor- tance of &quot; verification&quot; of cases as the best means of getting honest returns and good work, by which alone we may hope even- tually to convince the people of the benefits of vaccination, it may be well to record here what has been done in this respect during the year. Verification by Civil Surgeons. 8. The Vaccinators at the head-quarters of each district are under the respective Civil Sur- geons, who are expected to promote vaccination in and about their stations, and to examine the work done by the Vaccinators. At Elichpur, however, the Civil Surgeon, owing to the military duties he has to perform, cannot get into his circle to examine the work of the head- quarter's Vaccinator: therefore the District Superintendent examined 384 of the children operated on. The Civil Surgeon, Akola, examined some work in 28, of the 40, villages in which operations were performed. The Civil Surgeons, Wun and Buldana, each verified 60 per cent. of their cases, and the Civil Surgeon, Oomraottee and Basim, also rendered good ser- vices in this respect. Assistant Superintendent's exa- mination of work in villages. 9. Mr. Apothecary Pitts, whose services were placed at my disposal for three months during the working season, with a view to his assisting me in the verification of work done, joined my camp early in January to receive instructions. He then proceeded on tour of inspection, chiefly in the Basim, Buldana and Wun districts, but unfortunately he suffered a good deal from fever, and eventually was obliged to return to Akola 20 days before his three months' tour expired. However, he was able to verify work done in 298 villages, and by so doing rendered me good service. If I am fortunate enough to get his services next year, the experience he has gained this year will render him much more efficient. As simple as the examination of vacci- nation work may appear to be, a system of doing it is necessary, and this, like everything else, is best learned by experience. Increase of verifications by Dis- trict Superintendents. 10. When compared with the previous year, there is a marked improvement in the work done by the District Superintendents. In the Akola district, the Superintendent visited 400, out of 488, villages in which work was done, and verified 5,997, of the 8,769, successful cases. The Superintendent, Elichpur district, visited 330 villages, leaving only one uninspected( 3 ) In the Buldana district, the Superintendent visited 373, out of 423, villages entered by the Vaccinators, and proved the correctness of 5,121, out of 6,256, successfully recorded operations. The Wun Superintendent examined work in 359, out of 575, villages, and satisfied himself of the correctness of 3,584, out of 6,212, successful cases. The Basim Superintendent visited 257, out of 337, villages, where the Vac- cinators had been, and verified 3,490, out of 5,081, children marked. In the Oomraottee district, the Superintendent, who was only appointed at the beginning of the year, and was therefore new to the work, examined 3,126 successfully operated on children in 215 villages, the total number of successful cases in the district being 5,917 performed in 215 villages. The apparent fewness of villages visited, explained. 11. In reading over the last paragraph, one may be struck with the fewness of the number of villages in which vaccination was carried on, and the smallness of the number of children operated on, but then it must be re- membered that vaccination is not compulsory in Berar. It may be accepted or not by the people as they wish. The establishment has not yet been able to work in every village, so the operation is new to many, who from apathy, timi- dity, or other cause, will not bring their children forward to be vaccinated. Others again as Mahomedans, Rajpoots and Brahmins, who ought to know the benefits of vaccination, or at least have had opportunities of seeing that the operation is not a dangerous one, in too many instances positively refuse to allow their children to be vaccinated; besides the villages in many parts of the province are small and distant from each other, so that, from one cause or another, a Vaccinator has frequently to go long distances before he can get children to operate on. Coupled with these difficulties, he can only work in the mornings and evenings with a fair chance of success ; so that if he goes to a place and finds no one to operate on, the best part of a day is lost, and if a few fruitless journeys are made, in all probability a part of his supply of lymph will go bad: under all these circumstances, if we go on for a few years making gradual progress, and doing good work, we may hope that in time the people will see, from the number of children successfully vaccinated, who will escape small-pox, the benefit of the operation, as in the case instanced in last year's report, when mothers brought their children 10 miles to be vaccinated. Superintendent's work. 12. In judging of what I have myself done in the management of the department and the examination of work, it must be recollected that I am only able to devote a portion of my time to this most important duty. Besides the general super- vision of the whole of the department at the beginning of the working season, I frequently visited places up and down the line of rail where vaccination was commenced, to see that the first supply of lymph was good, and during the camping season, which with me lasted from the end of October till the begin- ning of March, examined a very large number of children who had been vacci- nated( 4 ) CHAPTER II. VACCINATION OPERATIONS PERFORMED. Statement I. 13. Statement No. 1 exhibits all particulars of vaccination carried on in the province in the year under report. Besides vaccination proper, it shows the area of each dis- trict and its population; the number of circles the districts are divided into, and the number of Vaccinators attached to them. Vaccinations performed, compared with the previous year. 14. The results of the year's operations, as compared with the previous year, are as fol- lows :( 5 ) believe in it, but as there are still many more children born who live beyond the time they should be vaccinated, I think that it shows that it is still neces- sary for the people to have impressed on them the benefit of vaccination. In some places in the Basim and Wun districts, the villages are small and scattered over large areas, so that it is not easy for the staff in them to overcome more work. Besides, in the Basim district, the Superintendent was not energetic: one Vaccinator was dismissed, two reduced, and several fined for laziness. The Assistant Commissioner and Tahsildar of Poosud have done their best to extend the benefits of vaccination. The same may be said of the district officers of Wun; and Captain Mackenzie, the Deputy Commissioner,has even gone so far as to examine the work done in some places, but so many people were vaccinated in this district in the previous two years, and the villages are so small and so far apart from each other, that more could not have been expect- ed than was done, especially as many of the Vaccinators were ill during the season. In the Oomraottee district two Vaccinators were dismissed, but this alone cannot account for the small increase of work done, as many children are yet unprotected in it. Caste of people vaccinated. 18. The castes of the people vaccinated in the two years are as follows :( 6 ) It shows improvement in the work done, and a great increase in the num- ber of cases verified. I may, however, remark here that when vaccination does not progress favorably, there is a difficulty in keeping up the supply of lymph, but as yet I don't see my way out of this difficulty, except by the district officials urging more strenuously than they even now do on the people the im- portance of getting their children vaccinated. Statement II.( 7 ) CHAPTER V. CONCLUSION. Previous order cancelled, and why. 25. In last year's report I showed that as the Hospital Assistant in charge of Dispensaries complained of not being able to get children to vaccinate owing to the Vacci- nators working in their towns, I directed that they should not vaccinate in any place where there was a Dispensary, so that the Hospital Assistants might have full scope to carry on their operations; but as in the year under report, they only operated on 622 children more than in the previous year, I purpose cancelling the order, as I feel justified that the Vaccinators' work has been curtailed to a greater extent than this. The difficulty of showing the be- nefits of vaccination at present. 26. It has been so frequently put to me that I should show the benefits of vaccination by com- paring the number vaccinated with the deaths from small-pox in each circle for the year, that I have thrown together the figures showing the number of persons vaccinated in each circle in the pro- vince, and the deaths reported from small-pox in each for four years, and, as I fully anticipated, found as much positive as negative evidence of the benefits of vaccination. The causes of this are numerous ; and it would take up too much space to enter into them here. I will therefore only report what I have often said be- fore, that is, that, at present, it is only by taking the statistics of &quot; units&quot; of registration that we can show the benefits of vaccination by its keeping down small-pox, and that if we wish to show it from figures referring to large areas, it is only by comparing the deaths which took place during the whole of an epidemic of small-poxAPPENDICES.

ABBOTT, ESQR.,M. D., SUPERINTENDENT OF VACCINATION. PRINTED AT THE RESIDENCY GOVERNMENT PRESS. 1876.
TABLE OF CONTENTS OF VACCINATION REPORT, FOR THE YEAR 1875-76. CHAPTER I.II TABLE OP CONTENTS. Paras. CHAPTER IV.No. 520 OF 1876-77. Remarks by the Resident on the Vaccination Report of the Hyderabad Assigned Districts for the year 1875-76. THE quantity of work successfully done by the Vaccinators has again, the Resident is glad to observe, increased, the figures being 42,949 cases in 1874-75, and 48,658 cases in 1875-76. The increase in the Amraoti district of 6,019 cases is very satisfactory, and is creditable to the Deputy Commis- sioner Captain Mackenzie. 2. The comparative statementin Appendix II, which has been prepared in accordance with the orders of the Government of India, and appears for the first time with the report, gives the vaccination work done at the Dispensaries for the calendar years, while the other returns are for the official years, but this discrepancy, unavoidable at present, will not occur again as the Vaccination Report is in future to be prepared for the calendar year. The slight increase that has taken place in the percentage of known unsuccessful cases seems to be due to a stricter standard of test very properly introduced by Dr. Abbott. 21.4 per cent. appears, however, to be a large proportion of unsuccessful cases. Without wishing to unduly press the question, the effect of which might only be to lead to falsification of the re- turns, or what is called in the Report &quot; paper cases,&quot; the Resident would certainly be glad to see this percentage somewhat diminished. The sub- ject is, no doubt, receiving the Superintendent's attention. 3. The deaths from small-pox during the year were 927. Dr. Abbott's remarks on this head in the Sanitary Report show that an epidemic which commenced in 1872 reached a very low ebb in the year under report, the deaths during the four years of its existence having been :( 2 ) was first introduced into the Assigned Districts, and justify the expectation that the benefits it confers will become more and more apparent to, and appreciated by, the people. The Resident would wish to see every officer in the Government service exerting himself to aid the operations of the Vaccination Department by the judicious exercise of his influence and in such other ways as may be possible. The assistance rendered in this respect by district officers has no doubt been very valuable, and is highly appreciated by Government. 5. The Civil Surgeons of Yeotmal and Basim have merited the acknowledgments of the Resident by their active supervision of the vaccine operations in the circles under their charge. On the other hand, Sir R. Meade regrets to observe that the Civil Surgeons of Amraoti, Akola, and Ellichpur are stated to have failed to perform this part of their duty. It is presumed that there was some special reason for the Acting Civil Surgeon at Akola being kept strictly to his Head-Quarters, and so prevented from aiding in supervising the vaccine operations in his district. The Resident is glad to hear that the District Superintendents of Vacci- nation worked so entirely to Dr. Abbott's satisfaction. His thanks are due to them, and also to the Tahsildars named at para. 31 who are said to have spe- cially distinguished themselves in rendering assistance in vaccination matters. The rewards, amounting to Rupees 185, recommended in para. 33 to be given to certain vaccinators who did the best work, are sanctioned, and the services of the village officials now brought to notice will be duly acknowledged by presenting them with suitable certificates under the signature of the Resident. In many cases, however, the names of the officials in question have not been given, and these should now be ascertained and reported for the Resident's information. 6. Lastly Sir R. Meade cordially acknowledges Dr. Abbott's labors as Superintendent of the Vaccination Department. He concurs in the opinion expressed at para. 11 of the report that the working of this Depart- ment is the most important duty Dr. Abbott is called upon to perform, and would exceedingly regret if other duties interfered to any serious extent with his due supervision of vaccination operations in the Assigned Districts. (By Order.) HYDERABAD RESIDENCY, The 16 th August 1876. A. J. DUNLOP, Offg. Second Assistant Resident,
From the Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, to the Second Assist- ant Resident, Hyderabad, (No. 2000-210.)( 2 ) 7. The following figures show the work in each district:CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION. Vaccination under what rules car- ried on. VACCINATION in Berar, as in other parts of India, is not compulsory. It is carried on in this province under the rules promulgated in 1873. Establishment. 2. The establishment consists of one Super- intendent, the writer, who has many other duties to perform; six native Superintendents( 2 ) The Civil Surgeon, Basim, also did good work in this respect, and verifi- ed 700 operations. Nor was the Civil Surgeon, Buldana, neglectful of this portion of his duty, though he was for a portion of the season indisposed. But none of the other Civil Surgeons examined any of the work done by the head-quarter Vaccinators. The Civil Surgeon, Akola, was on leave, and the Deputy Surgeon-General did not allow his locum tenens to leave the station to examine the work, or to visit outlying Dispensaries. The Civil Surgeon, Amraoti, writes: &quot;I was unable to go into the district &quot; this season owing partly to increased work, and partly to indisposition,&quot; and the Civil Surgeon, Ellichpur, explains that &quot; there was no opportunity &quot; for him to go out until it became so excessively hot that to do so would be &quot; dangerous to life,&quot; but as in previous years, when the medical officer in charge of the Troops at Ellichpur was also Civil Surgeon, the District Super- intendent of Vaccination examined most of the work done by the head-quar- ter Vaccinator. Work done by District Superin- tendents of vaccination. 9. The District Superintendents of Vacci- nation have done remarkably well: better even than in the previous year. They have visited more places, and verified a greater number of operations. The Superintendent, Akola district, visited 467 villages, and examined 7,985 children operated on. The Superintendent of Amraoti verified 6,253 operations in 411 villages. In the Buldana district, the Superintendent examined 5,868 cases in 410 villages. The Ellichpur Superintendent visited all the villages in which work was done, and examined 5,866 children operated on. The Superintendent, Wun district, has a large district, with a sparse popu- lation to work in : nevertheless, he examined 4,827 children in 414 villages. The Basim Superintendent joined after nearly 3 months of the season had passed; yet he visited 317 villages, and verified 4,496 operations. Superintendent's inspection. 10. I myself visited some villages in all the districts, and examined a fair share of the work done in this, and the previous year, in the months from November to the be- ginning of March. In my tour of inspection, I was obliged to reduce one Superintendent; but with the work of the other Superintendents, I was well satisfied. I believe they all work well, as indeed is shown in the last para ; and what is of equal importance, they do not side with the Vaccinators; but record fairly and honestly their conviction on each case seen. Of the work of the Vaccinators examined, some, and indeed the greater part, of it was excellent, but, as might be expected, in a large establishment like this, all the members of it are not alike, and therefore the work of some Vaccinators was not as good as it might have been; but, I think, it is all fairly stated in the statements submitted with this report, There are no &quot; paper- cases,&quot; and the &quot; results&quot; are all correctly recorded. Importance of verification of work believed in by Superintendents. 11. Some people, I believe, think that I spend too much of my time in the verification of work, and lay too much stress on the importance
( 3 ) of a careful examination of the work done in every village; but I expect those who think so may have had but little experience in the management of a Department such as the vaccination one is, as organized in India, where vac- cination is not compulsory, but may be accepted or not by the people just as they choose. For my own part, I look upon the working of this Department as one of the most responsible duties I have to perform, and so long as I am responsible( 4 ) the successfulness of them. I felt it imperative on me to issue such orders, as now that so many people are being vaccinated in Berar, about half those born in the year, it may be hoped, the benefit of vaccination may become ap- parent in a diminution of the deaths from small-pox in the epidemic which, I believe, commenced in November last, as compared with the one which com- menced in November 1872. Duration and deportment of epi- demic of small-pox. 16. In my Sanitary Report I showed that an epidemic of small-pox in Berar had a life existence of four years' duration. It became apparent as a new invading epidemic when the cold season set in in November. It passed through different phases of increase and decrease, which were due to atmospheric causes; hot weather favoring its advance, and dampness retarding it till it reached its height, or maximum of intensity( 5 ) given to the Vaccinators by the Deputy Commissioner, Captain Mackenzie, who, it may be remembered, took charge of the district early in December. In the Akola district, too, the advance made is satisfactory, and in the Basim and Ellichpur districts, it will be observed that some progress has also been made. While in the Wun and Buldana districts, the decrease is attributable to sickness among the members of establishment working in these districts. 20. The castes of those vaccinated, as compared with the foregoing year, were as follows:( 6 ) CHAPTER III. EXPENDITURE. Comparative expenditure for two years. 25. It is needless to enter into details of this here, full particulars being given in the statement. The total expenditure and average cost per child vaccinated in the cur- rent and previous years were ;( 7 ) New form ordered by Government. 28. Also in accordance with the wishes of Government, a statement is submitted showing the number of persons vaccinated from the year 1867-68 to 1875-76. What is to be done when people refuse to be vaccinated, yet a diffi- cult question. 29. It has been before remarked that Mu- hammadans do not accept vaccination readily: the same remark applies to some other castes of peo- ple too, and it is difficult to know how to act in regard to these when they listen neither to the advice of the district officials,&quot; nor to the persuasion of the Vaccinators. Yet it is hard on those who accept vaccination that such a danger as unvaccinated people may prove to be should be allowed to remain among them. Further, there is no doubt but that those who do not hesitate openly, or for the matter of that tacitly, to oppose us in carrying on vaccination( 8 ) Rewards asked for 1st Class Vac- cinators. 33. I beg also that as I have not it in my power to promote the 1st Class Vaccinators named below, who have done best during the year, the rewards opposite to their names may be granted them:APPENDICES.

REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE HYDERABAD ASSIGNED DISTRICTS FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1879-80. BY C. LITTLE, M. D. OFFICIATING SUPERINTENDENT OF VACCINATION. Hyderabad: PRINTED AT THE RESIDENCY GOVERNMENT PRESS. 1880.
No. 1952-A. OF 1880, Remarks by the Resident at Hyderabad on the Report of Vaccination in the Hyderabad Assigned Districts for the year 1879-80. THE work of the Vaccination Department has hitherto been noticed in the Sanitary Report, but is now reported on separately for the sake of convenience, with the sanction of the Government of India, as the vaccination year ends on 31st March, and the sanitation year on 31st December. Dr. Little has shown in the present clear and interesting record results which the Officiating Commissioner rightly characterizes as &quot; on the whole very satisfactory.&quot; An increase of 28 per cent., as compared with the previous year in the number of persons vaccinated, and of 36 per cent. in the number of successful cases, is exhibited; while the percentage of successful cases to the total number of operations rose from 90.5 to 94. The average cost per head for each successful case &quot;was four annas three pies or one anna ten pies less than last year.&quot; The total cost of the department was Rs. 16,469, which also is less than the total cost for 1878. 2. The percentage of cases of which the result was &quot; unknown&quot; is 5.4, and this constitutes the least satisfactory feature of the general return. Such cases, it is manifest, should be deducted from the total vaccinated before taking the percent- age of success, but Dr. Little points out that this was not done in former years, and so Berar was unfairly weighted in a comparison with other provinces. In para. 44 of his Report for 1878 the Sanitary Commissioner wrote :( 2 ) 5. The two districts in which the increase of work is most conspicuous are Akola and Buldana, and Dr. Little attributes this &quot; to the ready assistance rendered by the Deputy Commissioners, as well as to the activity and zeal of the Superintendent of those districts.&quot; The Superintendent of the Amraoti District would seem to be open to correction, from the remarks made in paras. 32, 33, and 38 of the Report. The table below gives details for each district:( 3 ) this object, on all possible occasions, so far as they can do so legitimately. The Deputy Commissioner of Basim might inquire the cause of no person in the village Roda having as yet been ever vaccinated. Dr. Little's supervision of the Department deserves cordial acknowledg- ment. (By order,) G. H. TREVOR, Secretary HYDERABAD RESIDENCY, 14th September 1880.
No. 3170 OF 1880. FROM LIEUT.-COLONEL J. G. BELL, Officiating Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To THE SECRETARY FOR BERAR TO THE RESIDENT, Hyderabad. DATED AMRAOTI, 30th June 1880. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward the Annual Vaccination Report for 1879-80, received from the General Superintendent in this office on the 11th instant. See paras. 32 and 33. 2. The results, as given in the Report, must be deemed, on the whole, very satisfactory. The number of operations was 69,807, against 54,199 in the previous year, and the ratio of successful cases per mille of the popu- lation rose from 20.8 in 1878-79 to 28.3 in the year under report. Doubt- less the unhealthiness of the previous year had something to do with the decrease in vaccination. For the prevalence of disease must have had a depressing effect on both subject and operator. Vaccination must be making some progress when we find, as shown by Dr. Little in his para. 7, that there has been an increase of nearly 13 per cent. in the number of children born, who have been protected by means of vaccination from the inroads of small-pox. The reason why the ratio of success obtained in Berar in former years has been shown to be less than in other provinces, is very clearly shown in Dr. Little's para. 8. I think it is only fair that cases in which the results of vaccination are really unknown should be deducted before the percentage of success is obtained. I say really unknown because further on, in his Report, Dr. Little shows how much these unknown cases may affect general averages. 3. In the Akola and the Buldana Districts, there is the greatest increase in work done, which is attributed by Dr. Little to the ready assistance rendered by the Deputy Commissioners of those districts, and to the activity and zeal of the Superintendents. It must, however, be admitted that the Deputy Commissioners' calls upon their Tahsildars must have been zealously responded to by those officials, for it is impossible that Deputy Commissioners can, with their other more onerous duties, take any personal part in inducing people to get their children vaccinated. They can, and no doubt do, make their influence felt. either for or against vaccination; but it is, I think, to the taluk and village officials, as well as to the judicious and conciliatory behaviour of the Native Superintendent and his vaccinators, that, we must look for any appreciable increase in vaccination. 4. In his para. 15, Dr. Little gives the amount of inspection done by Civil Surgeons, who are Superintendents for the head-quarter circles of their districts. The Civil Surgeon, Akola, would seem to have done no inspection work, while that of the Civil Surgeon, Amraoti, is merely nominal. B152
( 2 ) As both these officers are in administrative as well as in medical charge of the two large jails at Akola and Amraoti, I do not see how they can be expected to do inspection work outside their sadr towns. As Superin- tendents of their jails their time should be fully occupied, subject, as it is already, to encroachments made by calls upon it, to enable them to fulfil their duties as Superintendents of Dispensaries, and I agree with Dr. Little in thinking that it would be advisable to hand over their circles to the Native Superintendents. 5. In his Chapter IV. Dr. Little explains (para. 25 the falling-off in the number of vaccinations at dispensaries, a subject to which I referred in my review of the Inspector General's Report on dispensaries. 6. In his Chapter VI. Dr. Little shows the season's work and results according to disiricts. He is able to speak well generally of the Superintendents as well as of the conduct of Vaccinators. 7. A suggestion is made in paras. 45 and 67 for facilitating arm-to- arm vaccination, on which Dr. Little might be asked to report at length. 8. In his general remarks, Chapter VII., Dr. Little refers to the passive opposition displayed by the higher classes of Hindus and Mahome- dans, and also, I regret to see, of Government servants, who seem to show an indisposition to have their children vaccinated. To overcome this oppo- sition Dr. Little, in his para. 81, suggests that it should be &quot; compulsory on all Government servants to have their children vaccinated&quot; and that Deputy Commissioners should have &quot; the power of insisting on vaccination within their respective districts.&quot; There can be no objection to the first proposal, if Government servants are engaged with a knowledge before- hand that they will be required to have their children vaccinated, as a con- dition of their remaining in the service, but to make vaccination generally compulsory throughout the province would not, I think, be altogether desir- able. By patience and judgment on the part of Superintendents and Vaccina- tors, and a certain amount of co-operation insisted upon from Tahsildars, it is to be hoped that the operations of this Department, which undoubtedly show well for the year under report, will yet make further strides, and satisfy the expectations of even so zealous an officer as Dr. Little. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, J. G. BELL, Offg. Commtesioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts.

As no vaccination is carried on in Berar during the hot weather and rains, it becomes necessary to raise a new supply of lymph before the 1st of October, the commence- ment of the vaccination season. Accordingly, some tubes of animal lymph having been obtained from Bombay, calf vaccination was started at Akola on the 15th September, under my immediate supervision. From this centre, animal lymph was distributed to the several District Superintendents, and animal vaccination maintained in each district until successful results were reported from every vaccination circle, when calf vaccination was discontinued, except in the Akola District, where it was kept up throughout the season for the purpose of renewing the supply as required. The work was then carried on by arm-to-arm vaccination, as far as possible, or by lymph preserved in tubes. Result of humanized lymph obtained from England. 2. In October a supply of humanized lymph was received from England and distributed to each Superintendent. It proved successful in each district, but the results were not so good as those obtained from the lymph propagated in the province, and it was allowed to die out. Introduction of animal vaccination and process of raising cow lymph described. 3. Animal vaccination was introduced into Bombay in 1869 by Dr. Blanc, who had previously practised it in London, and since then the system of calf vaccination has been carried on by the Bombay Vaccination Department, from which department the lymph can be purchased at the rate of one rupee a tube. On receipt of the lymph from Bombay, I immediately procured a healthy heifer, which was operated upon as follows:( 2 ) CHAPTER II. SEASON'S WORK FOR THE PROVINCE. Statement No. I.( 3 ) Details of primary vaccination per- formed during the year. 10. The following table shows the full details of primary vaccination performed during the year:( 4 ) Work done by Native Superintend- ents during the year compared. 14. Table No. IV. compares the work per- formed by Superintendents during the year : ( 5 ) On account of their jail duties, the Civil Surgeons of Akola and Amraoti plead inability to supervise vaccination in their respective circles. If these duties are such as to prevent them supervising and checking the work of the Vaccinators under them, it would be advisable to hand over their circles to the Native Superintendents. At Ellichpur the head-quarter circle comprises only the cantonment and Paratwarra. Hence the Civil Surgeon is shown to have visited only one village. The Civil Surgeon, Buldana, performed the most work, having verified 624 cases out of a total of 794 vaccinated. The Civil Surgeon, Basim, comes next with the low number of 273 out of 1,033 vaccinated, though he visited 33 villages to the Civil Surgeon, Buldana's 29, and drew more travelling allowance. There has been a considerable falling-off in the work done by the Civil Surgeon, Wun, for which no explanation is offered. CHAPTER III. STRENGTH AND PARTICULARS OF ESTABLISHMENT AND COST OF THE DEPARTMENT. Statement No. II. exhibits the strength and cost of the Department during the year. Strength of the vaccine staff. 16. The vaccine staff in 1879-80 was as follows;( 6 ) Sickness amongst Vaccinators. 21. There was a good deal of sickness amongst the Vaccinators during the year, and two died. When a man falls sick, there is frequently no one to take up his work, and consequently the work must suffer. Appointments, promotions, &c. 22. The following appointments and pro- motions were made, and punishments inflicted during the year:( 7 ) Greatest amount of work performed during the year 1877-78 since the organ- ization of the Vaccine Department. 28. In the year 1877-78 the greatest amount of work was performed since the establishment of the department. The explanation of this is that vaccination was carried on throughout the greater part of the year, as small-pox was prevalent in the province, and not confined merely to the usual vaccination season. CHAPTER VI. SEASON'S WORK AND RESULT ACCORDING TO DISTRICTS. Amraoti District. Strength of establishment. 29. Moorad Khan, 2nd Class District Superintendent;1 Head Vacci- nator, two 1st Class Vaccinators, two 2nd Class Vaccinators ; six 3rd Class Vaccinators, one Apprentice, one Peon. Area and population. Area 2,759 square miles, population 501,331. No. vaccinated compared with pre- vious year. 30. The number vaccinated in this district during the year was 12,344, against 8,905 in the previous year. The percentage of success being 93.4 to 90.1. Inspection work done by Native Su- perintendent. 31. The increase in the work is satisfactory, both as regards quality and quantity; but the amount of work inspected by Mr. Moorad Khan was less than that done by any other Superintendent. Out of 748 villages in which vaccination work was performed, he visited 270 and verified but 45.5 per cent. of the work done in his district. Percentage of successful cases. 32. The percentage of success for the district, 93.4, would be most satis- factory were it not for the number of &quot; un- known&quot; cases (No. 772), that is, those cases which have been operated on but which have not afterwards been seen either by the Vaccinator or Superintendent, and of which the result necessarily remains &quot; unknown.&quot; Vaccinators punished for falsifying returns. 33. In some instances Vaccinators, in order to show good results, enter all unsuccessful cases under this head. If found out, however, they are punished for thus falsifying their returns. The conduct of the Vaccinators, with the exception of one man, is reported to have been good. Higher class of Hindus and the Mahomedans opposed to vaccination. 34. Very little obstruction to vaccination was met with, but the Superintendent reports that much difficulty is experienced with the higher classes of Hindus and the Mahomedans in persuading them to have their children vaccinated. Average cost of each successful case. 35. The average cost of each successful vaccination was 4 annas 6 pies. No. of children under one year vac- cinated compared with birth-rate. 36. The number of children under one year vaccinated was 6,582, or 38.4 per cent. of the births of 1879. Inspection by General Superintend- ent. 37. The work I inspected in this district was good. Conduct of Native Superintendent. 38. The Superintendent, Mr. Moorad Khan, is inclined to be lazy, and is slow in submitting returns and replying to references.

Out of the 905 villages in which work. was performed, 387 were visited by the Native Superintendent, who travelled during the season 1,320 miles, or 8.7 daily. Quality of English lymph not so good as that raised in the district. 49. The Native Superintendent reports that the English lymph sent to him in October was not so good in quality as the lymph raised in the district. The areola was badly defined, the vesicles imperfect, and the resulting scars shallow. Replenishment of lymph from..cow vaccination. 50. The lymph in this district was replenished from a calf that had been inoculated with small-pox matter. From the lymph obtained in this manner 45 children were successfully vaccinated, and the lymph then humanized was propagated. Work of vaccination staff. 51. The Superintendent reports that the Vaccinators under him worked well with one exception, 3rd Class Vaccinator Wahad Khan, of the Darwha circle, whose work was bad, due to careless vaccination. Number of children under one year successfully vaccinated. 52. The number of children under one year successfully vaccinated was 5,929, or 51.3 per cent. of births of 1879. Cost of each successful case. 53. The cost of each. successful case was 4;annas and 4 pies. Commendation to Native Superin- tendent. 54. Mr. Ajaj Hoosain, 3rd Class Native Superintendent, worked to my entire satisfac- tion. He is energetic and painstaking. Basim District. Strength of establishment( 10 ) Cost of each successful case. 61. The cost of each successful case was 5 annas and 7 pies. Native Superintendent recommend- ed, for pension. 62. The Native Superintendent, Mr. Govind Sukojee, has been nearly eight years in the department as Superinten- dent, having come to Berar from the Bombay Vaccination Department, in which he served 18 years. He has done good service in Berar, but having become physically unfitted for the work, his pension papers have lately been sent in. Akola District. Strength of establishment(11) Number vaccinated. 71. In this district the total number vac- cinated was 14,505, which gives an increase of 4,747 over last year's figures. Ratio of success. 72. The ratio of success was 93.8 per cent., and of unknown cases 4.9. Work done by Native Superintend- ent. 73. Tire Superintendent visited 383 villages out of 734 in which work had been performed, and travelled 1,127 miles at the rate of 7.4 miles a day. 55.9 per cent. of the work done in the district was verified. Number of children under one year successfully vaccinated. 74. The number of children under one year vaccinated was 7,354, or 56.3 per cent. of births of 1879. The cost per successful case was three annas eight pies. People in most of the towns and large villages opposed to vaccination. 75. The Superintendent reports opposition in most of the towns and larger villages, and urges the necessity of the village authorities being compelled to assist the Vaccinators in the performance of their duties. Conduct of vaccination staff. 76. The general conduct of the Vaccina- tors has been good, and the quality of the lymph used excellent. Commendation to Native Superin- tendent. 77. Head Vaccinator Kareem-ud Deen is energetic and hard-working, and the increase in the out-turn of work over last year is creditable to him. He must endea- vour, however, to cultivate a little more of the suaviler in modo in his dealings with the people. CHAPTER VII. GENERAL REMARKS. Supervision by General Superin- tendent. 78. During my tour, I examined vaccination work in five districts, and was fairly satisfied with what I saw. Careless vaccination was the exception, and the lymph, generally, was excellent. In any circle where the lymph was weak, or appeared to have degenerated, a new supply of either animal or good humanized lymph was immediately introduced. Necessity of frequent and careful inspection of vaccination work. 79. In order to secure honest returns, frequent and careful inspection of the work done by each Vaccinator is neces- sary ; and in this respect District Superin- tendents must needs be somewhat more energetic. The attitude and feeling of the people as regards vaccination. 80. Little direct opposition is met with to vaccination in Berar, still the people are apathetic and will not avail themselves freely of its protective power. Brahmins, Rajputs, and Mahomedans are the most difficult to induce to get their children vaccinated, and I have noticed that even the educated Brahmins in Government employ passively oppose the work, and won't willingly, as a rule, have their children operated upon. It is surprising that this section of the community, who have so freely availed themselves of the means of education offered them by Government, should not yet have learnt the practical benefits of vaccination. In some few villages and towns, opposition is still met with, but they are the exception and could easily be overcome by the personal influence of district officials.
(12 ) During epidemics people easily sub- mit to vaccination. 81. Epidemics of small-pox have been shown to recur in this country periodically, about every fourth or fifth year. At these times people will submit to vaccina- tion readily, but when the disease has passed away, they become careless and either neglect or refuse to have their, children vaccinated, so that the intervals between epidemics are not employed as they ought to be in protecting the greatest possible numbers. I would therefore suggest that Deputy Commissioners should have the power of insisting on vaccination within their respective districts, and that it should be compulsory on all Government servants to have their children vaccinated. Immunity from small-pox of persons successfully vaccinated. 82. During my tour over the greater part of the province, I did not meet with a single child pitted with small-pox in whom the vaccine cecatrices were well marked. I saw children with small-pox pits and bad vaccine marks, but these were cases which had been vaccinated after they had suffered from small-pox( 13 ) Commendation to Tahsildars. 86. In conclusion, I would bring to notice the following Tahsildars who have rendered active assistance to the department:APPENDICES.

No. 5191 OF 1881. Memo. by Officiating Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, on the Vaccination Report for 1880-81. THIS Report was received from the Sanitary Commissioner on the 10th August, submitted to the Secretary for Berar with this office No. 4152 of the 11th idem, with a view to its being printed, and received back on 26th instant. The form of the Report from the Sanitary Commissioner differs considerably from that of the Report for the previous year. Para. 3 of Report. 2. The remarks made in this para, as to the attitude of the people show that generally there has been great improvement in the feeling of the people on the subject of vac- cination; and this is matter for congratulation. The suggestions made by the Sanitary Commissioner for still further familiarizing the people with the aims and objects of vaccination might be adopted, though it will probably not be found necessary to call in all patels to the sadr at the commencement of the season. It will be sufficient if Deputy Commissioners take means for letting the patels know, through the leading men, such as Patels, Deshmukhs, Deshpandias, Honorary Magis- trates, and members of municipal and local committees of the district, that opera- tions are about to commence, and that Government expects assistance in further- ing vaccination at the hands of all people of any influence in the province. The remarks made by the Sanitary Commissioner in the concluding por- tion of this para. are the reverse of complimentary to municipal committees in general, and to the Amraoti Committee in particular. The Deputy Commis- sioner, Amraoti, should look to this. * The falling-off in the Ellichpur and Buldana Districts is ascribed, in the first named district, to the Officiating Superin- tendent being new to the work, and not keeping his staff up to their work sufficiently. In the latter, it is said to have been due to a failure in the supply of lymph in the early part of the season, and one of the vaccinators having fallen id. 3. It is very satisfactory to notice that the outturn of work in the year under report exceeded largely that of the previous year.* The total number of opera- tions performed by the Vac- cine Department was 80.083, of which 86.7 per cent. of primary vaccinations, calculated in the manner ordered by Government, were successful, and 13.3 unsuccessful. In addition to the above, there were 5,649, against 2,373 in 1879-80, operations at dispensaries, of which 4,947, or 87.6 per cent., were successful. The number of secondary operations by vaccinators was only 67, of which 18, or 26.9 per cent., were successful, and 45, or 73.1 per cent., were unsuccessful or doubtful. In re-vaccinations at dispensaries, 87.7 were successful. The great difference in successful re-vaccinations done at dispensaries and by the vaccine establish- ment would appear to call for explanation, but none is afforded in the Report. I observe in the Vaccination Report for 1880-81 for the Central Provinces that 94 per cent. of operations are said to be successful, while in Oudh in 1877-78 the proportion is 85.9. The difference noticed in the figures for the three different provinces is probably due to some variation in the mode of calculation. 4. Dr. Little attributes the falling-off this year in the percentage of successful operations to the use of lymph preserved in tubes, and proposes in future to substitute ivory points for the purpose of conveying lymph from one village to another. Whether Dr. Little is right in his surmise as to the cause of decrease in successful operations depends upon the mode in which lymph used in vaccination in the previous year was preserved, and this the Report does not show.
( 2 ) The Sanitary Commissioner has again omitted to notice the subject referred to in para. 2 of the Resident's Review on the Report of last year. 5. The vaccination establishments remain much the same as they have been for the previous two years, Their total cost was Rs. 16,247-13-1, all paid from provincial funds. The average cost of each successful operation for the province was Rs. 0-3-9, against Rs. 0-4-3 in the former year. The average cost varied from Rs. 0-2-11, the minimum, in the Amraoti District, to Rs. 0-5-3, the maximum, in the Ellichpur District. * The latest Report I have. In the Central Provinces for 1880-81, the average cost for each successful operation was Rs. 0-2-1¼, while in Oudh for 1877- 78,* I find it Rs. 0-7-4. The cost of vaccination must, of course, depend upon the number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator, and this must again depend upon the character of the country in which operations are carried on. It will necessarily be more diffi- cult to find subjects in the more sparsely populated districts of Basim, Wun, and the southern portion of Buldana, than in the more densely populated villages of the valley of Berar. 6. The figures, however, given in para. 7 of the Report do not satisfy me that this fact is sufficiently recognized. In the Ellichpur District, for instance, with the large town of Ellichpur, and a great number of very large villages, it will be noticed that each vaccinator performed only; 1,079 operations, while in Basim, Buldana, and Wun, where the villages are smaller and much farther apart, each vaccinator operated on over 1,300 subjects. In the Central Provinces the average number operated upon by each vaccinator is 1,511. In Oudh, again, I find the figure to be as low as 641, the highest number in any district, that of Sitapur being only 930 ; but I notice that vaccination is said &quot; to be in a very backward state&quot; in the province of Oudh. I think more work may be expected of vaccinators who work in the valley of Berar. 7. Referring to the figures given in para. 9 of the Report, it would appear that about half the number of children born annually are protected by vaccination ; and Dr. Little claims for Berar that this was the highest ratio attained in 1879-80 by any province in India. Looking at the figures given in the Central Provinces' Report for 1880-81, and taking the annual birth-rate, as Dr. Little has, at 40 per mille, I find the percentage of infants successfully vaccinated in the Central Provinces was 49.4. The only remark to be made on these figures, it appears to me, is that there is yet ample scope for the vaccinator's energy, while 50 per cent. of the children born are unprotected from small-pox. 8. It is gratifying to find that Dr. Little is able to record his satisfac- tion at the way his own establishments have worked, and for the assistance he has received at the hands of the native gentlemen named in the concluding para. of his Report. Dr. Little's Report shows clearly what has been done during the year, and proves that under his energetic supervision good work has been accomplished, for which he deserves the acknowledgments of the Administration.

No 92. FROM SURGEON CHARLES LITTLE, M. D., Superintendent of Vaccination, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To W. B. JONES, ESQ., C. S., Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. DATED AKOLA, 10th August 1881 SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit the Report and returns of Vaccination in the Hyderabad Assigned Districts for the year ending the 31st March last The delay in the submission of this Report has been caused by an increased amount of work in this office, as I have explained in the first para. of my Dispensary Report, and latterly to the occurrence of cholera in the province Season of vaccination. 2. Vaccination is carried on in Berar for six months of the year only, from October till April. This system was introduced in 1872, when the department was in its infancy, as it was not considered desirable to work throughout the whole year, on the grounds that the vaccine vesicle did not thrive so well in the hot and the damp months, and as arm-to-arm vaccination could not be carried on during these months, except with difficulty, it would be necessary to use preserved lymph, which would increase the number of doubtful and unsuccessful cases, and, as a consequence, necessitate a large number of re-vaccinations, against which the people were said to be extremely preju- diced. Although arm-to-arm vaccination is one of the best methods of practice, and the one which is always carried out when practicable, yet I find lymph preserved in tubes and on points to be fairly effective: and the vaccinators might, I think, be employed with advantage for the greater part of the year, suspending operations for two months only, during the height of the monsoon. Attitude of the people. 3. There has of late years been a great improvement in the feelings of the people on the subject of vaccination, though amongst certain classes and castes opposition is still met with. These are chiefly Mahomedans, Marwadies, Rajputs, Deshmukhs, and in the larger towns, Brahmins and men of position who passively oppose the work. There does not appear to be any real religious prejudice against vacci- nation, but there is apathy and indifference, and where resistance is met with, it is often due to the opposition of the women, who object to the subsequent inflammation of their children's arms, which is but too often in excess of what it should be owing to the irritating and dirty substances they apply during the maturation of the vesicle. The people generally, however, fully under- stand the efficacy of vaccination as a protective against small-pox, and in the presence of this disease, their apathy quickly vanishes, and they are then eager that their children should be vaccinated. As an instance of this, I B445( 2 ) would mention that I lately received an application for the services of a vaccinator from the patel of a village in the Akola District, small-pox having broken out in his village. His request, I need hardly mention, was immediately complied with, though it was in the non-working season. In order that vaccination may be brought home to the people, a good deal of course depends on the efficiency of the vaccination staff itself, not only that the vaccinators should know their work well, but also that they should cultivate the popularity of the people amongst whom they are working. When the department was first formed, many men were of necessity employed as vaccinators, who, owing to their caste and want of education, made but little way with the people, and were but too often regarded with sus- picion and dislike, consequently the department was more unpopular than might otherwise have been the case, and the vaccinators met with consider- able difficulty in getting children for operation. Of late years, however, a better class of men have come forward, and I have now found it possible to fix a standard of education, and only accept those who can produce a certificate of having passed the 6th standard examination, as fixed by the Educational Department. I have reason to believe that the standing of the department has, in consequence, improved in the eyes of the villagers, and that the vaccinators are more looked up to and respected than formerly. Even with the most efficient staff, however, but little work would be performed without the support and influence of the civil authorities; and of the value of such legitimate support, the Superintendent's reports bear witness. Of course everything depends upon the nature of the influence exerted, and where the, district officer shows an active interest in vaccination, all classes will readily come forward to assist. I would, however, remark that it is unnecessary for civil authorities to take pains to constantly assure the people that vaccination is entirely voluntary. This is of course true, but repeated assurances of the fact by those in authority are apt to prove injurious, by leading the people to believe that they disapprove of vaccina- tion. I would recommend that men of position, such as Honorary Magistrates and Deshmuks, should be spoken to by the Deputy Commissioner on the subject, and that just before the commencement of the year's operations, the Deputy Commissioner should call in all the patels of his district, and point out to them the aim and object of vaccination, and urge upon them the necessity for their assisting the vaccinators instead of putting difficulties in their way. Much also might be done by the native members of municipal com- mittees ; but, whatever be the cause, they have not shown any interest in the work. In the town of Amraoti, the Superintendent, a man of tact and per- suasion, failed utterly in carrying on vaccination, and he could get no assist- ance from the municipality, although he applied to the committee for their aid and influence. System of Vaccination. 4. The system of vaccination adopted in this province is on the prin- ciple of working at small areas with close supervision. Each district is apportioned into a certain number of circles, and a vaccinator assigned to one or more, who works from the point where lymph is first started in gradually widening circles. The work of each district is supervised by a native Superintendent, and the work of the province by the Superintendent General. The vaccinator in each circle works from village to village, leaving as few unvaccinated children as possible behind him. The rule is to vaccinate from arm-to-arm, never using preserved lymph except where arm-to-arm vaccination cannot be carried out. On entering a village the vaccinator explains his duties to the Patel, and procures his assistance in collecting children. This collection of the children is an absolute necessity, both for operation and for verifying the
( 3 ) result afterwards. The Patels are generally willing and able to render the necessary assistance. The instrument in use in Berar is the needle-vaccinator, which consists of six steel points inserted into a bone handle, leaving the points exposed about 1½ lines in length and 3 in breadth; at the other end is a plated spa- tule for applying the lymph to the latticed scratches made by the needles, Raising of lymph. 5. On the 15th of September a supply of animal lymph was obtained from the Bombay Vaccination Depôt, with which a, calf was vaccinated the following day. Only one puncture proved successful, and from this vesicle a second calf was inoculated with success on the 21st. On the 23rd a second supply was received from Bombay, which also proved successful. From the calves thus inoculated lymph was now collected in capillary tubes, which were hermetically sealed, and four tubes sent to each Superintendent on the 28th and further continuous supplies, until reports were received that each district had raised lymph for itself. Animal vacci- nation was then allowed to die out except in the Amraoti District, where it was kept up throughout the season, by which Superintendents could renew their lymph if required. No indent for English lymph was submitted as heretofore, the animal lymph propagated in the province having been found to give better results. The native Superintendents and vaccinators were at their posts in the last week in September; and the first supplies of lymph sent from Akola having proved successful, except in the Buldana District, operations com- menced in the first week in October. In the Buldana District the work commenced on the 24th October. Season's work. 6. The total number of operations performed during the year was 80,150, as compared with 69,807 in 1879-80. The following table shows the work performed in each district contrast- ed with that of the preceding year. TABLE No. I.( 4 ) there has been a falling-off, especially in the Buldana District. On an average each vaccinator performed 1,358 operations, against 1,396 last year. The apparent falling-off in the numbers operated upon by each vaccinator is due to the average having been worked on the total staff employed in each district, apprentices included. In previous reports apprentices, who were not appointed to circles, were not taken account of in working out these aver- ages. If these men be excluded, the averages for the two years, 1880-81 and 1879-80, would be 1,484 and 1,396, respectively. TABLE No. 2.( 5 ) charged by dipping the point into the vaccine lymph as it collects after the rupture of a vesicle, and when it becomes dry the point is rolled in some cotton wool. Lymph thus preserved will remain active for a long time. The following table shows in detail the results of the year's operations in each district : ( 6 ) vaccinator. I saw the children, and did what I could for their arms. The people were naturally very angry, but when they saw that they were sympa- thised with, and that the vaccinator was punished, they appeared satisfied. It is cases like this which bring discredit on vaccination; and no little blame attaches to the Native Superintendent in not having seen the man's work before and put a stop to the use of the bad lymph. The work in each district will be noticed further on. I visited those towns where vaccination was backward, and assisted Superintendents in pressing on vaccination and removing difficulties. In the village of Rodha, mentioned in last year's Report as one in which no vaccination had been carried on since the department was formed, I am glad to be able to say that through the influence and tact of the Tahsildar of Pusad, Mr. Badr-ud-Deen, almost all the children in the village were operat- ed upon. The following statement exhibits and compares the inspection work done by each Native Superintendent:( 7 ) The Civil Surgeons of Akola and Amraoti were not given circles last season, as on account of their jail duties they would have been unable to efficiently supervise them ; but as they have now been relieved of the jails, they will have a circle to supervise next season as formerly:( 8 ) The staff of vaccinators assigned to each district was proportioned according to the population of the district. The Native Superintendent of the Basim District, Mr. Govind Sukojee, having been pensioned, it was necessary to appoint a man in his place ; but as none of the vaccination staff were fitted for promotion to this grade, I filled up the post by appointing a clerk out of the office, Mr. Trimbak Rao, who, though unacquainted with the practical work of vaccination, had a thorough knowledge of the working of the department from his office experience. This Superintendent accompanied me on my tour, during which he has acquired a fair knowledge of his duties, and I have every reason to hope that he will make a good Superintendent. The Amraoti Superintendent, Mr. Murad Khan, was transferred to the Basim District, and 1st Class Superintendent, Mr. Bappu Rao, to Amraoti. The Ellichpur Superintendent, Mr. Abdul Carim, was sent to Buldana, and the Ellichpur District, as being the smallest and most easy to work, was assigned to the new Superintendent, Mr. Trimbak Rao, and head vac- cinator Mahomed Talib appointed to act for him. The following appointments and promotions were made and punish- ments inflicted during the season:( 9 ) Though vaccination at dispensaries has somewhat improved, still much more in this direction might be effected. I endeavour to stimulate exertion, but subordinates in charge of outlying dispensaries may do pretty much as they like, and when called to account for neglect of this important part of their duties, they plead want of assistance on the part of the village officials, difficulty in obtaining children without such assistance, and other dispensary duties, fully employing their mornings, and preventing them vaccinating from house to house. In conclusion, I have to record my satisfaction of the manner in which the several Superintendents and their establishments under them worked during the year, and I would bring to notice the names of the following gentlemen to whom I am indebted for the active assistance they rendered to the department during the season's operations:AMRAOTI DISTRICT. Area in square miles 2,759. Number of inhabited villages 1,097. Population 501,331. Strength of establishment.

Raising of lymph. The season's operations were started on the 29th of September with a supply of animal lymph received from Akola, with which a calf was vaccinated. This proving successful, lymph was propagated and distributed to each circle. Season's work. The number of operations performed during the year amounted to 20,061, against 12,344 in the previous year, showing an increase of 7,717. The average number vaccinated by each vaccinator was 1,672, against 1,234, and the ratio of vaccinations per 1,000 of population 40 to 24.6 in 1879-80. The percentage of successful operations to total vaccinated in the district was 85.2 to 87.5 in the previous year. The percentages of unsuccessful and unknown cases were 8.6 and 6.2, respectively, against 6.2 and 6 3 last year. The numbers successfully vaccinated under one year were 8,176, or 47.8 per cent. of total successful vaccinations. The percentage of the annual birth-rate protected against small-pox, calculated at 40 per 1,000 of the population, was 40.7. The total expenditure on vaccination for this district was Rs. 3,129-9-9, and the cost per successful case Rs. 0-2-11, against Rs. 0-4-6 in the previous year. Inspection. Out of 926 villages in which vaccine operations were conducted, 541 were visited for inspection, and 12,747, or 63.5 per cent. of the. total number vaccinated in the district were verified. The Native Superintendent visited 439 villages, verified 10,600 cases, or 52.8 per cent. of the number vaccinated in the district, and travelled 1,714 miles, or on an average of 9.4 daily. The head vaccinator verified 2,147 operations, and travelled on an average nine miles a day. Attitude of the people. Obstruction to the spread of vaccination was met with in the town of Amraoti. The Superintendent reports that although he applied to the municipality for assistance, he entirely failed to carry on work in this town. In the head-quarter circle some difficulties were experienced by the vaccinator, which, however, the Superintendent succeeded in removing by his personal influence and persuasion. In other parts of the district no real opposition was experienced except amongst certain classes, as Mahomedans, Marwadis, Rajputs, and Brahmins. The Superintendent writes:( 2 ) Conduct of vaccinators. The conduct of the staff was generally good. The vaccinator of the Kurha Circle was not sufficiently careful in his work in this circle, the quality of which was indifferent. The vaccinators of the Dhanaj and Takalkheda Circles left several villages unvisited, and are reported as being lazy and careless. These men will be removed from the department should they not improve. Two men were fined for irregular submission of returns, and one dismissed for bring- ing false charges against a Patel. The Superintendent, Mr. Bapu Rao, is active, intelligent, and painstaking; he is con- ciliatory and kind to the people, and is a most efficient officer. The Superintendent brings to notice the following Tahsildars and gentlemen who have rendered him assistance:( 3 ) Small-pox. There was no small-pox in this district during the season. Conduct of vaccinators. The conduct of the staff was good. Head Vaccinator Mahomed Taleh, who officiated as Superintendent, is steady and painstaking, but he lacks influence and weight with his staff. The Superintendent of this district, Mr. Trimbak Rao, having only been appointed at the commencement of the season, and being new to the work, accompanied me on tour for the purpose of gaining an insight into his duties. He is an intelligent and capable man, and will, I hope, make a good Superintendent. WUN DISTRICT. Area in square miles 3,907. Number inhabited villages 1,162. Population 323,689.

The strength of the establishment remained the same as last year. Establishing lymph. The first two supplies of animal lymph received from Akola on the 29th September and 13th October, respectively, failed; but a third supply received on the 18th October proving successful, both humanized and animal lymph was propagated and distributed to each circle. Season's work. Out of 1,162 villages in the district, vaccination was carried on in 963, and 12,280 operations were performed against 9,753 in the pre- vious year. Of these, 12,258 were primary and 22 secondary operations, the percentage of success, respectively, being 92.5 and 54.5. The percentages of unsuccessful and unknown cases, 4.8 and 2.7, respectively, are lower than those for any other district except Ellichpur. The number of infants successfully vaccinated was 6,981, or 53.9 per cent. of annual birth-rate, estimated at 40 per thousand of population. The average number vaccinated by each vaccinator was 1,364, or 280 in excess of last year, which is above the average for the province and comes next to Amraoti, compared with other districts. The total expenditure on vaccination in this district was Rs. 2,437-14-6, and the average cost per successful case Rs. 0-3-5, against Rs. 0-4-4 in 1879-80. Inspection. Work was performed in 963 villages, out of which 685 were visited, and 11,502 cases verified, or 93.6 per cent. of the total vaccinations. Of these the Native Superintendent verified 8,949 and travelled 1,551 miles, or 8.5 miles per day, and the head vaccinator 506 miles, or 8.6 miles daily. The Superintendent General examined the work in the Digras Circle, which was on the whole good. Attitude of the people. No direct opposition is met with, but the Superintendent reports that much difficulty is experienced in carrying on the work amongst the Banjaras, of whom there are two or three hundred tandas in the district. Their leaders, Ramu Nayak and Shama Nayakore, are opposed to vaccination. Conduct of vaccination staff. The conduct of the vaccinators was good, except that of the 3rd class vaccinator Bapu Rao Mahadeo, who was lazy and careless, and whose work was found by the Superintendent to be very unsatisfactory. The Superintendent, Mr. Ajaj Hussain, is steady and hardworking. He has risen in the department, and understands his work thoroughly, and has worked satisfactorily during the year.

Raising of lymph. Two supplies of animal lymph were received from Akola on the 29th of September and 7th October, respectively, both supplies proved suc- cessful, and lymph, both humanized and animal, was distributed to each vaccinator, and by the 2nd of November the work was in full progress throughout the district. Season's work. Out of 881 inhabited villages in the district, vaccination work was performed in 577. The total numbers vaccinated were 9,355, or 1,020 in excess of the previous year. The average number vaccinated by each vaccinator was 1,169, against 1,190 in 1879-80, and the ratio of suc- cessful vaccinations per 1,000 of population 29.7, against 26.7. Of the total number vaccinated, 88 per cent. proved successful, 5.7 unsuccessful, and 6.3 unknown. The number of children under one year successfully operated upon was 4,865, or 43.9 per cent. of the birth-rate, estimated at 40 per 1,000 of population. The total expenditure on vaccination in this district was Rs. 2,097-12-11, and the cost per successful case Rs. 0-4-1, against Rs. 0-5-7 in the previous year. Inspection. The results of vaccination were verified in 311 villages, out of 577 in which work was. performed. The total number of miles travelled by Superintendent was 954, or at the rate of 5.2 miles a day, and by the head vaccinator 250 miles, or 4.2 daily. The Superintendent General inspected the work in 8 out of the 11 circles in this district, and was fairly satisfied with what he saw. Attitude of the people. The opposition formerly met with in this district is gradually being overcome, though in some villages the vaccinators have still difficulty in getting children for vaccination. Character of the staff. The vaccinators are reported to have performed their duties satisfactorily with the exception of one man, who was reduced for bringing a false charge against a Patel. Native Superintendent Murad Khan worked satisfactorily during the year. He brings to notice the assistance rendered in the cause of vaccination by the Patel of Medsi. AKOLA DISTRICT. Area in square miles 2,660. Number inhabited villages 969. Population 480,657. Strength of the establishment. ESTABLISHMENT. 1 Native Superintendent. 1 Head Vaccinator. 2 1st Class Vaccinators. 2 2nd do. do. 5 3rd do. do. 3 Apprentices. 1 Peon. The vaccination staff was increased by three men as compared with last year. Raising of lymph. The Superintendent took a vaccinated calf from Akola into the district, from which he raised a supply of lymph, and by the commencement of November each circle was at work.
( 5 ) Season's work. The number of villages in which work was performed was 802, out of 969 inhabited villages in the district. The total number vaccinated was 17,541, against 16,631 in the previous year, and the ratio of success 82.7, against 88.3. The percentage of unsuccessful and unknown cases was 8.1 and 9.2, against 5.9 and 5.7, respectively. The average number vaccinated by each vaccinator was 1,349, against 1,512 in 1879-80, and the number of successful vaccinations per 1,000 of the population 30.2, against 30.6. The number of infants vaccinated was 8,910, or 46.2 per cent. of births, estimated at 40 per 1,000 of the population. The total expenditure on vaccination was Rs. 3,021-2-3, and the average cost of each successful case Rs. 0-3-4, against Rs. 0-3-6 in the previous year. Inspection. Out of the 802 villages in which vaccine operations were performed, the work was inspected in 509. The Superintendent visited 396 villages and verified 9,826 cases, or 56.0 per cent. of the total num- ber vaccinated. The number of miles travelled was 1,115, or an average of 6.1 daily. The head vaccinator travelled 293 miles, visited 113 villages, and verified 2,389 cases during the month he was engaged on this work. The Superintendent General inspected work in the Jalgaon taluk. Attitude of the people. No direct opposition but much difficulty is experienced in the larger towns amongst natives of rank and Government clerks. The native Superintendent reports that considerable difficulty was experienced in this respect in the following towns:( 6 ) Season's work. Out of 888 inhabited villages in this district, vaccine operations were carried on in 743, and a total of 13,356 children were vaccinated, against 14,505 in the previous year, which shows a falling-off in the number of operations by 1,149. The falling off is accounted for by Superintendent as due to the failure of lymph in the early part of the season, and to one of his vaccinators being a month on the sick list. Of the total operations 84.4 per cent. proved successful, 10.5 unsuccessful, and 5.1 unknown, as compared with 89.2, 5.9, and 4.9, respectively, in 1879-80. The average number vaccinated by each vaccinator was 1,336, against 1,813, and the ratio of success- ful operations per thousand of population, 30.7 to 35.3 in the previous year. The number of children under one year successfully vaccinated was 6,348, or 47.5 per cent. of total operations. The percentage of the annual birth-rate, calculated at 40 per thousand of population protected, was 43.7. The season's expenditure on vaccination in this district was Rs. 2,805-5-0, and the cost of each successful case Rs. 0-4-0, against Rs. 0-3-8 in 1879-80. Inspection. Of the total 888 villages in which vaccination was carried on, work was inspected in 743, and 8,720 cases, verified, or 71.9 per cent. of the total vaccinations in the district. The native Superintendent visited 408 villages, inspected 7,517 cases, and travelled 1,437 miles, or at the rate of 7.9 miles daily. The head vaccinator inspected work in 64 villages, verified 1,203 cases, and travelled 150 miles. The Superintendent General inspected the work of 6 out of the 8 circles in this district. In the Nandura Circle the work inspected was indifferent, and in the Kingaon and Lonar Circles a good deal of bad work was met with. Attitude of the people. No active opposition is experienced, but many of the higher classes passively oppose it, particularly in the larger towns. Conduct of vaccinators. The conduct of the staff was fairly good : one man was reduced, and another dismissed for bad and careless work. 3rd class native Superintendent Mr. Abdul Carim is intelligent and active, and performs his vaccination duties fairly well; but he is much to blame for the bad work in the Kingaon Raja and Lonar Circles, for he should have inspected the work in order to judge of the quality of the lymph before December, in which month the Superintendent General visited the circle.

No. 4619 OF 1882. Memo. by Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, on Vaccination Report for 1881-82. THIS is a full, clear, and interesting Report, to which I have very little to add by way of comment, as the facts could hardly be better stated. The main figures are briefly as follow: Vaccination Report, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, 1881-82. System of pursuing vaccination and raising lymph. THE system of vaccination, as pursued in Berar, was described in lastyear's Report, as also the attitude of the people and the method of raising lymph. The usual supply of animal lymph was received from Bombay in two instalments, on the 5th and 9th of September, and animal vaccination started at Akola. Successful results were obtained with both supplies, and continuous issues of lymph were sent out to each District Superintendent till, by the end of the month, the work was well started in every district, and each Super- intendent had raised a supply of animal lymph for himself. The expenditure on account of animal vaccination for the season amount- ed to Rs. 22-13-11. This was chiefly for the feeding of the calves and for bandages to protect the vessicles. No difficulty is found in obtaining calves. They suffer no harm from the operation, and are returned to the owners after eight days. It was not found necessary to indent for a supply of English lymph. Establishment. 2. The establishment at the beginning of the season was brought upto the sanctioned strength, and was two in excess of last year as shown in the following table:( 2 ) Reductions. One from 1st to 2nd class for insubordination, 1 from 3rd class to ap- prentice grade for absenting himself from his circle without leave. Dismissals. One for bad work, one for disobedience of orders and leaving the pro- vince without permission. This man applied for leave on the ground of sickness and was directed to attend the nearest dispensary and submit a medical certificate; instead of doing so, however, he left Berar and went to his home at Aurangabad. Taken as a body the vaccination establishment worked to my satisfac- tion during the year. With some few exceptions, the vaccinators take an intelligent interest in their work, and are conciliatory towards the people amongst whom they labour. With but one exception, the Native Superintendents performed their duties with honesty, zeal, and assiduity, and exercised a careful supervision over their respective establishments. They have taken pains to ensure that the work done should be good, and a commendable spirit of emulation as to which Superintendent would show best results has stimulated them to do their best. It has been customary to commend the most deserving Superintendents in the Annual Report, and I therefore beg to bring to the favourable notice of the Resident( 3 ) The total number vaccinated shows an increase of 10,019 over the number for the previous year, while it is higher by 20,362 than in 1879-80. These gradually increasing totals are pretty general in every district, but in Amraoti and Buldana there has been a falling-off during the year under report. In Amraoti the Superintendent was new to the work, it being the first time he had officiated as Superintendent, which may account for the decrease in the numbers vaccinated. In the Buldana District a vaccinator absconded in the middle of the season, and there was no one available to fill up the vacancy. The average number of operations performed by each vaccinator was 1,670, as compared with 1,358 last year. The following table shows by districts the average number of opera- tions performed by each vaccinator compared with the previous year: ( 4 ) In primary vaccination the highest percentage of success, 93.4, was obtained in the Wun District, and the lowest, 86.7, in Akola. The rate for the province was 89.8, as compared with 86.7 in the previous year. The total number of re-vaccinations performed was 111, against 67, and the percentages of success 63 and 26.9 respectively. The number of unsuccessful and unknown cases under both heads is lower than in the previous year. The standard of success obtained in primary operations in Berar does not compare favourably with that for other provinces in India, though it is better than the results obtained last year. The cause of this cannot be explained other than the difficulty experienced by the vaccinators in carrying on arm-to-arm vaccination. Mothers object to take their children from one village to another in order to allow of lymph being taken from the vessicles on the spot, even though offered batta at the rate of two annas a mile; consequently the vaccinators have to resort to the use of stored lymph with the result of a larger number of failures than if liquid lymph from one arm to another had been used. The persuasive powers of the vaccinators go a very little way towards overcoming the scruples of the people in this direction. Though special attention was paid to the quality of the vaccination in each circle, and every endeavour made to ensure good results, even at a sacrifice of numbers, yet the result has been only 89.8 per cent. of success, as compared with 98 and 96 in Bengal and Bombay respectively. Every endeavour will, however, it is needless to remark, be made to work up to these standards. Vaccination work of Berar compar- ed with other provinces. 4. The following table compares the vaccination work performed inBerar with that of other provinces in India. The figures show the average of the last four years, and have been compiled from the reports of the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India. Compared with the neighbouring Central Provinces, it. is curious to note that, though the average numbers vaccinated by each vaccinator, per- centage of success attained, and the proportion of the population protected, are higher than in Berar, yet the death-rate from small-pox is also higher. TABLE No. 5.( 5 ) 100 persons vaccinated there were 50.9 males and 49.1 females as compared with 50.2 and 49.8 respectively in the previous year. The census tables of 1881 show the relative proportions of the sexes to be 51.6 males and 48.4 females per cent. of total population, so that relatively, with reference to the population, more females were vaccinated than males by .7 per cent. This may be explained by the fact that amongst the people of India more value attaches to the life of a male than a female child, and whilst the latter are brought forward more readily for vaccination, the former are often kept back by their mothers, who are fearful lest the opera- tion should do them any harm. The following table shows all particulars regarding the sex of the vaccinated:( 6 ) past five years :( 7 ) promoted to 3rd class vaccinatorships showing less work both as regards quantity and quality than the old hands. * Deorao Shamrao. Vital Ramchandar. Balcrishna Venkatesh. Ramcrishna Damodhar. Bapurao Narrain. With the exception of the five men noted in the margin* (who will beadequately punished after the recess), the results obtained by the vaccinators were very fair, varying from 98.2 to 81.5. In some instances quality appears to have been sacrificed to quantity and this has, I find, been too much the case formerly, a vaccinator looking more to the number of operations performed than to the proportion of success attained. I have, however, endeavoured to impress upon all in the depart- ment that good work is of more importance than quantity, and promotion is awarded chiefly according to the quality of the work, though at the same time a fair amount is expected. Each vaccinator should be able to operate upon 2,000 cases in a season with at least 90 per cent. of success, and every endeavour is being made to work up to this standard. The percentages on population have been worked on the old census figures, those for 1881 not being available for circles, so that they cannot be taken as absolutely correct though relatively they may be fairly compared. Inspections. 8. The following table shows the extent of supervision exercised by theSuperintendents over the work of the vaccin- ation staff in their respective districts:( 8 ) previous year:( 9 ) The average number of cases operated upon by each Hospital Assistant was 153, ranging from 464 at Ellichpur to 18 at Chikalda Dispensary. The work done at each dispensary is shown below :( 10 ) primary vaccination, and 75 in re-vaccinations, as compared with 87.6 and 87.7 respectively in the previous year. These figures compare fairly with the returns of the Vaccination Depart- ment, but the percentage of success attained in re-vaccination still appears somewhat too high. In the Buldana District, out of a total number of 28 re-vaccinations, 23 are returned as successful, which is suspiciously high. The Civil Surgeon's attention has been directed to this fact. Vaccination at Melghat. 11. An attempt was made this season to extend the benefits of vacci- nation amongst the hill people of the Melghat, and a 1st class vaccinator was attached to thecamp of Mr. Ballantyne, Deputy Conservator of Forests, an officer of muchinfluence among these primitive and timid people. The total number operated upon by this vaccinator was 1,134. or 23.2 per 1,000 of the total population, and the percentage of success attained was 87.4, as compared with 89.8, the average for the province. The vaccinator met with considerable opposition; in some villages he was actually driven out by the people, and in others they fied at his approach. These aborigines hold some extravagant beliefs and prejudices regarding vaccination. It appears that two stories had been spread amongst them as to the reasons of Government in carrying on vaccination. One was to the effect that Government by the operation was collecting blood to besmear the idol of Maha-devi, near Calcutta, that the devi (goddess) herself did not approve of the people assisting the Government, and would visit with her displeasure those who did. Shortly after this story got abroad, the vaccina- tor fell ill with fever, and had to be brought into the Chandur hospital for treatment. The people were so sure that the devi had cursed him, and that he would die, that they sent in to enquire, but he fortunately recovered and returned to work. The second story was that it had been prophesied that a child would be born having milk instead of blood in his veins, who would become a great king and upset the English Raj,( 11 ) The following native gentlemen also rendered active assistance locally, and I would ask that they might be awarded commendatory certificates signed by the Resident for their services to the Department:( 12 ) Statement showing vaccinatian work performed by each Vaccinator in each circle of Vaccination in Berar during the year ending 31st March 1882.

AMRAOTI DISTRICT. Area in square miles 2,759. Number of inhabited villages 1,015. Population 575,328. Strength of establishment. 1 Native Superintendent, officiating. 2 First Class Vaccinators. 2 Second Class Vaccinators. 8 Third Class Vaccinators. 1 Apprentice. 1 Peon. The strength of establishment was one in excess of last year. Raising of lymph. 2. On the 16 th of September a supply of animal lymph was received from Akola,with which two calves were operated upon the following day. The operation proved successful on one calf, from which fresh calves were operated upon, and animal vaccina- tion kept up till 20th October, when it was discontinued after the Superintendent had satisfied himself that each vaccinator was working with good lymph, and that the work was in full progress. Season's work. 3. The total number vaccinated in this district aggregated 18,787, as compared with20,061 in the previous year. Of these 18,782 were primary and 5 re-vaccinations. The percentage of success being 89.4 and 60.0 respectively, as compared with 85.2 and 0 in 1880-81. The percentage of unsuc- cessful and unknown cases was 5.2 and 5.3 respectively. The number of infants success- fully vaccinated was 9,675, or 42 per cent. of annual birth-rate estimated at 40 per 1,000 of the population. The average number vaccinated by each vaccinator was 1,566, against 1,672 in the preceding year, which is below the average for the province, and lowest but one of any district. Out of 1,015 villages in the district vaccination was carried on in 954. The season's work does not. compare: favourably with that for the previous year. This is in some measure due to the Officiating Superintendent being new to the district and to Superintendent's work. It is expected that he will show better results next year. Inspection. 4. Work was performed in 954 villages, out of which 523 were visited by Superin- tendent, and 10,513 cases verified, or 56 per cent. of the total vaccinations. This is a low percentage, and is the lowest for the province except Wun, where the Superintendent was ill and unable to work for two months. The average number of miles travelled daily was seven, which is above the average for the province. This would indicate that though the Superintendent showed activity in travelling about, yet that he did not exert himself sufficiently to examine all the work in the villages visited. Cost of vaccination. 5. The total expenditure on vaccination in this district was Rs. 3,469-9-0, as com- pared with Rs. 3,129-9-9 in the previous year. The differ- ence is due to excess in establishment over last year. The cost of animal vaccination was Rs. 5-2-6. Attitude of the people. 6. The Superintendent reports that the people generally understand the benefits ofvaccination, but that no active opposition was experienced though certain classes are unwilling to have their children vaccinated, chiefly Mahomedans, Marwadis, and Brahmins. In the town of Amraoti the members of the municipality rendered considerable assistance, but many children still remain to be vaccinated. Conduct of vaccinators. 7. The conduct of the staff was fairly satisfactory. The Superintendent is an intel- ligent man, but requires experience and tact in the manage- ment of the men under him. Inspection of vital statistical registers. 8. The following statement shows the particulars of Superintendent's examination of vital statistical registers:( 2 ) due to establishment having been distributed this season in equal ratio to population in each district. Establishment. 1 Native Superintendent. 2 Third Class Vaccinators. 1 Head Vaccinator. 1 Apprentice. 2 First Class Vaccinators. 1 Peon. 1 Second Class Vaccinator. Raising of lymph. 2. Animal lymph in tubes was supplied from head-quarters in three instalments onthe 17th, 20th, and 24th September. The first and last proved successful on the 22nd and 29th. From this both humanized and animal lymph was raised, and a supply distributed to each vaccinator, andby the 13th of October successful results had been obtained by all. Season's work. * The discrepancy between the census and vaccination returns is being inquired into. 3. Out of the 420 inhabited villages in the district work was carried on in 441*and 10,287 operations were performed, against 7,557 last year. Of these 10,269 were primary operations and 186 re-vaccinations, the percentage of success being 90.4 and 50. respectively, as compared with 92.6 and 0 in the previous year. The percentages of unsuccessful and unknown casesin primary vaccination was 6 and 3.5, as against 4.7 and 2.7 respectively in the precedingyear. The number of infants successfully vaccinated was 6,234, or 57.5 percent of annual birth-rate estimated at 40 per 1,000 of population. The average number vaccinated by each vaccinator was 1,714, or 635 in excess of last year. This is above the average for the province, and comes third on the list as compared with the other districts. The season's work compares favourably with last year, and is creditable to the Superintendent and his staff. Inspections. 4. Of the 441 villages in which work was performed, 31S were visited by the Super- intendent, who verified 5,241 cases, or 63.3 per cent. of the total number vaccinated in his district. The number of miles travelled by Superintendent during the season was 1,241, or an average of 6.8 daily. The Superintendent General inspected the work in Anjangnon and Assegaon circles, and was much pleased with the quality of the vaccination of these circles. Attitude of the people. 5. No opposition was met with from the people of the Ellichpur District, but theKurkus of the Melghat are much opposed to the operation, and carry the children into jungles at the approach of a vaccinator. in some instances they opposed the vaccinator by force. This is due chiefly to ignorance and timidity, which, it is hoped, will be overcome in time. For some time past the department has been endeavouring to secure the services of a Kurku as a vaccinator, for these simple people would not be so likely to fear one of themselves as they would a stranger unable to talk their language. One man did promise Major Mackenzie to take service on certain conditions as regards food and raiment, which were readily agreed to. When the time came, however, for him to join Mr. Ballantyne's camp and learn his work under the vaccinator attached to this officer's camp, he made all sorts of excuses and never came. Small-pox. 6. Small-pox in a mild form appeared into the town of Paratwada during the season, but vaccine operations were pressed on, both in and around the affected locality. Conduct of vaccination staff. 7. The conduct of the vaccinators as reported by Superintendent was good. Oneman, however, was reduced during the season for careless work in continuing to propagate indifferent lymph in some of the villages of his circle. Native Superintendent Mr. Trimbak Rao is fulfilling my expectations as expressed in last year's Report. He has performed his duties with tact and intelligence, but there is room for improvement in personal inspection of work. He submitted a very good and interesting report. Inspection of vital statistical registers. 8. The Superintendent examined the vital statistical registers of 318 villages.These, with a few exceptions, were generally found written up to date. The principal mistakes were in the classification of cause of death. All mistakes noticed were pointed out to the village writers and explained, and also the object of Government in requiring this information regarding the domestic occurrences of thepeople. The sanitary condition of villages visited was enquired into in the light of Resident's Book Circular No. 16 of 1880. As a rule these circular instructions were not attended to, and in many instances the village officials did not know of the existence of such rules, though they were always to be found in the Patwari's &quot; Dafter.&quot; The Superintendent,
( 3 ) wherever he found it necessary, read over and explained these rules not only to the village officers but to the surrounding villagers; he very truly observes that something more than the mere preaching of these instructions is necessary to improve matters Cost of vaccination. 9. The total expenditure incurred on vaccination in this district was Rs. 2,565-15-4,and the cost per successful case Rs. 0-4-0, as compared with Rs. 2,289-8-2 and Rs. 0-5-3 in the previous year. Theincrease in cost is due to the first class vaccinator on duty in the Melghat having beenshown against Ellichpur District. WUN DISTRICT. Area in square miles 3,907. Number of inhabited villages 1,139. Population 392,102.Strength of establishment. Establishment. 1 Native Superintendent. 2 Third Class Vaccinators. 1 Head Vaccinator. 2 Apprentices. 2 First Class Vaccinators. 1 Peon. 2 Second Class Vaccinators. The strength of the establishment remained the same as last year. Raising of lymph. 2. On the 16th of September six tubes of cow lymph were received from Akola withwhich one calf was vaccinated on the 17th, and two more on the following day from a second supply received from Akola. These proved successful on the 23rd and 24th, and animal lymph was distributed to each vaccinator. By the 16th of October successful results had been obtained in each circle of work. Season's work. 3. The total number of cases operated upon during the season was 13,613, with apercentage of success of 93.4, as against 12,280 and 92.5 per cent. respectively last year, which shows an increase both in the quantity and quality of the season's operations. The average number of oper- ations performed by each vaccinator was 1,702, which is in excess of last year by 338, and above the average for the province, yet below the standard of 2,000, which each man should be able easily to reach. The number of children under one year successfully vaccinated was 7,710, or 49.2 per cent. of the annual estimated birth-rate. Out of 1,139 villages in the district vaccine operations were carried on in 1,017. Inspection. 4. Of the total number of villages in which work was performed 388, or 33.1 per cent. were visited by &quot;the Superintendent, who verified 4,639 cases, equal to 34.7 per cent. of the total vaccinated. He travelled during the season 1,280 miles, or an average of seven daily. Cost of vaccination. 5. The expenditure on vaccination in this district amounted to Rs. 2,492-14-10, and the average cost per suc- cessful case was Rs. 0-3-2, against Rs. 0-3-5 in the preccding year. Attitude of the people. 6. The Superintendent again reports that no opposition is met with except from theBanjaras. Their headmen or naiks actively oppose vacci- nation and the result is that small-pox is not unfrequent amongst their &quot; tandas&quot; or encampments. Small-pox. 7. An outbreak of small-pox appeared amongst a tanda of Banjaras in the mouth ofMarch near the village of Gatanji, and 14 children died of the disease. The Civil Surgeon of the district enquired into the outbreak, and reported that not a single case had been vaccinated. Conduct of the staff. 8. The conduct of the staff was fairly good; one man was punished for inefficientwork. The Superintendent, Mr. Ajaj Hussain, suffered from a severe attack of pneumonia, and was obliged to take two months' leave, during which time head vaccinator Shaik Karamat officiated for him. This Superintendent is steady and hard-working, and does his work satisfactorily. Inspection of vital statistical registers. 9.

Raising of lymph. 2. On the 16th of September animal lymph in six tubes was received from Akola..With these a calf was vaccinated on the 17th, which proved successful on the 23rd. From this, both animal and human- ized lymph was propagated, and by the 21st of October every vaccinator was at work. Season's work. 3. Out of 841 villages in the district work was carried on in 765, and a total of13,739 children were vaccinated, against 9,355 in the pre- vious year, which shows an increase in the number of opera- tions of 4,384, which is creditable to the Superintendent and his staff. Of the total operations 93.2 per cent. proved successful, 4.8 unsuccessful, and 2 per cent. unknown, as compared with 88, 5.7, and 6.3 respectively in the previous year. The average number vaccinated' by each vaccinator was 1,963, against 1,169 last year. This is the highest average for any district, and the results attained are highest but one, which go to show that quality of work was not sacrificed to quantity. The number of children under one year successfully vaccinated was 7,182, or 52.8 per cent. of total operations as compared with 52. in the previous year. The percentage of the annual birth-rate estimated at 40 per 1,000 of the population protected was 50. Inspection. 4. Of the total 765 villages in which work was carried on, the Superintendentvisited 496, and inspected 7,963 cases. The head vaccinator who assisted the Superintendent for the last month of theseason verified 1,459 cases, so that 74.3 per cent. of the total work was examined. TheSuperintendent travelled 1,152 miles, or at the rate of 6.3 daily. Cost of vaccination. 5. The season's expenditure on vaccination in this district was Rs. 2,400-11-3 andthe cost per successful case Rs. 0-3-0, as compared with Rs. 2,097-12-11 and Rs. 0-4-1 in the preceding year. Attitude of the people. 6. No active opposition is met with, but Superintendent reports, that Rajputs, Brahmins, Marwadis and Banjaras do not favour vaccination. Conduct of the staff. 7. The conduct of the staff was good, and no punishments were awarded. Secondclass Native (Superintendent Murad Khan has worked satis- factorily, and deserves credit for the increase in the work performed as compared with previous year. Area in square miles 2,660.

The strength of the vaccination staff remained the same as last year. Raising of lymph. 2. Vaccination was commenced in the town of Akola on the 16th September onwhich date 34 children were vaccinated from a calf. All the vaccinators were at work by the 24th of October. Season's work. 3. The total number of operations performed during the season was 20,995, against17,541 last year, and the average number operated upon by each vaccinator 1,749, as compared with 1,349 in 1880-81. The ratio of successful vaccinations per 1,000 of population was 3.07, against 30.2 in the previous year. Of the total operations 86.7 per cent. proved successful, 7.3 unsuccessful, and 5.9 unknown, as compared with 82.7, 8.1, and 9.2. The lowest rate of success was reached in this district, which is not creditable to Super- intendent and his staff. The number of infants under one year protected was 9,980, or 47.6 of the total vacci- nated. The percentage of the estimated annual births successfully vaccinated was 42.1. 4. The number of villages in which work was performed was 856 out of a total number of inhabited villages in the district of 970. Inspections. Of these villages 523 were visited by Superintendent, who verified 10,762 cases. Inaddition 1,487 cases were verified by the head vaccinator dur- ing the last month of the season, so that 58.3 per cent. of the total work performed was inspected. The number of miles travelled by Superintendent was 1,356, or an average of 7.5 daily.
( 5 ) Cost of vaccination. 5. The total cost of vaccination in this district was Rs. 3,292-6-1, and the cost of each successful case Rs. 0-2-11, against Rs. 3,021-2-3 and Rs. 0-3-4 respectively for the pre- vious year. Attitude of the people. 6. There is no direct opposition offered to vaccination, but the Superintendent reportsthat considerable difficulty is experienced in the larger towns and mentions the following :( 6 ) BULDANA DISTRICT.

The strength of the establishment remained the same as in the previous year. Raising lymph. 2. On the 16th September, six tubes of cow lymph were received from Akola. Withthese one calf was vaccinated the same day, which proved successful, as did likewise two more supplies received on the 17th and 21st, and by the 18th of October all the vaccinators were at work. Season's work. 3. Out of 887 inhabited villages in this district vaccination was carried on in 744,and 12,748 operations were performed, against 13,356 in the previous year. Of these 12,745 were primary and 3 re-vaccinations, the percentage of success respec- tively being 87.8, and 0. The percentage of unsuccessful cases, 8.9, is the highest of any district, and would point to bad work. The number of infants successfully vaccinated was 6,676, or 37.9 per cent. of annual birth rate estimated at 40 per 1,000 of the population. The average number vaccinated by each vaccinator was 1,416, or 80 in excess of last year. This is the lowest average of any district, and lower than the average for the pro- vince, and is not creditable to Superintendent. Inspections. 4. Of the 744 villages in which vaccination was carried on, 554 were visited by Super- intendent, who verified 7,506 cases, or 58.9 per cent. of total vaccinated. The head vaccinator verified 1,003 during themouth he was on this duty. Superintendent travelled 1,489 miles during the season, atthe rate of 8.2 miles a day. Cost of vaccination. 5. The season's expenditure on vaccination in this dis- trict was Rs. 2,576-11-8. and the cost of each successful case Rs. 0-3-8, against Rs. 2,805-5-0 and Rs. 0-4.0 in 1880-81. Attitude of the people. 6. The Superintendent reports that the people in this district understand the benefits of vaccination and that little opposition is met with. Conduct of vaccinators, 7. The conduct of the staff was fair. Two vaccinators worked carelessly, and one man absconded in the middle of the working season. Third class Superintendent Mr. Abdul Karim has not given me satisfaction, and the work of his district, both for this and the previous year, does not compare favourably with that of other districts.

No. 4177 OF 1883. FROM S. O. B. RIDSDALE, ESQ, C. S., Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To THE SECRETARY FOR BERAR TO THE RESIDENT, Hyderabad. DATED AMRAOTI, the 15th August 1883. SIR, I HAVE the honor to forward herewith the Annual Report on Vaccination for the year 1882-83, which reached me on the 4th instant at Hyderabad. 2. The results of the year's operations are thus summarized by Doctor Little in comparison with the figures of the preceding year. There has been an increase of 13,589 in the total number of persons vaccinated, of 2 per cent. in the proportion of successful cases, and of 251 in the average number of operations performed by each vaccinator, while the cost per successful case was less by 7 pies than in 1881-82. These results are very satisfactory and are praiseworthy indications of the zeal and energy with which the operations of the department have been conducted. 3. The increase in vaccination has been general throughout all the districts of the province except in Akola, where there has been a very slight falling off. The increase is most conspicuous in Buldana, where the number of operations this year was 53 per cent. greater than in the year preceding, and next in Amraoti, where the increase is 17 per cent. These two districts were those which appear from para. 12 of the Report to have suffered most from the small-pox epidemic which prevailed during the latter part of the year, and the people were consequently driven by fear of the epidemic to bring their children to the vaccinator. 4. It is not so satisfactory to observe that the proportion of cases inspected and verified by the Superintendents was somewhat less this year than last, 51 per cent. having been inspected this year, against 59 per cent. last year. The deficiency occurred in the districts of Amraoti and Akola; in the former owing to the Native Superintendent's illness, in the latter from his want of energy, for which he has been duly taken to task by Doctor Little. 5. Considering the small degree of prejudice against vaccination which has to be encountered among the general population of Berar, it is not unreasonable to hope that in a few years a very considerable proportion of the population may be protected from small-pox. That the number of suc- cessful operations should have more than trebled in the last ten years is an encouraging proof of the advancing popularity of the treatment. 6. Vaccination appears, however, still to be very backward in dispensary towns, and it is in these that the mortality from small-pox has been particularly severe. It is perhaps to be expected that in the case of a disease so highly infectious as small-pox, the rate of mortality would rise in proportion to the density of population; but on the other hand these larger towns have greater resources of organization and supervision for carrying out systematic vaccin- B261
( 2 ) ation. It would certainly be advisable, besides inculcating on the Hospital Assistants the necessity of greater activity, to remind the committees of these towns of the importance of paying greater attention to this matter, and to the serious risk to the public health which they incur from neglecting it. Indeed I see no reason why the suggestion which Dr. Little makes at the close of his Report, that vaccination should be made compulsory in municipalities and ultimately in other principal towns, should not be carried out in Berar in the same way as vaccination is enforced in municipalities in the Central Provinces, namely, by inserting in the bye-laws a provision making failure on the part of a parent or guardian to submit children within six months from birth to the vaccinator a nuisance offending against public safety, and punishable with fine on conviction. It remains, however, to be seen whether our municipalities would agree to such a provision, as it appears that the principal opponents to vaccination are to be found among the better classes, who would command a majority in the committees. However the attempt might well be made. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, S. O. B. RIDSDALE, Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts.
NO. 66 OF 1883. FROM SURGEON C, LITTLE, M. D., Superintendent of Vaccination, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To S. O. B. RIDSDALE, ESQUIRE, C. S., Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. DATED AKOLA, 5th July 1883. SIR, I have the honor to submit the Vaccination Report for the year ending the 31st March 1883. Strength of Department, 2. The total strength of the department was the same as last year, and corresponded with that sanctioned by Government. Establishment. 3. The Native Superintendents are energetic and efficient men, and capable of performing the duties required of them. During the year the department suffered a loss in the death of 1 st class Native Superintendent Shams-ud Din who, during his nearly 11 years' service as Superintendent, had gained the confi- dence of his superiors and the respect of all in the department. The conduct of the staff was on the whole good, as the punishment roll given below would go to show. Punishments. Reductions.( 2 ) Dispensary vaccination will be noticed further on, In the Melghat a vaccinator worked for three months of the year attached to the camp of the Deputy Conservator of Forests, during which time he performed 495 operations, with a percentage of success of 88.1. Vaccination is thus being gradually introduced amongst the timid Korkoo inhabitants of these hills, and when these people come to understand that no hurt is intended to them or their children, and get accustomed to see the vaccinator in their villages, the work will be pushed on with more energy. The work performed by the special vaccination establishment, as com- pared with that of the previous year, is set forth in the next table. :( 3 ) falsifying his returns is most severely punished. The percentage of success is calculated upon the vaccinators' returns as corrected by Superin- tendents, who verified 51' per cent. of the total work. The next table compares the work of the year in each district with that of the preceding year:( 4 ) TABLE NO. VI.( 5 ) Age of those vaccinated. 6.

In the Central Provinces the Civil Surgeon has the entire supervision of the district vaccination work instead of merely the head-quarter circle, as in Berar, and is required to go into camp during the cold weather on inspection duty. TABLE No. 12.(12) primary operations and 41 re-vaccinations, and the percentage of success attained was 87.6 and 31.7 respectively, as compared with 88.74 and 75.0 in the preceding year. This percentage of success in primary vaccination is low, as compared with the provincial results, 91.8. The percentages, however, (100) recorded for the Wun and Deulgaon Raja dispensaries are very high. Mr, Chamarett, Civil Surgeon. of the Wun District, states he is satisfied that the figures are genuine. With regard to Deulgaon Raja the Hospital Assistant there was punished for neglecting vaccination, and I doubt such successful results. The proportion of re-vaccination returned is more reliable than that shown in previous reports, Hospital Assistants not having understood the difference between secondary and re-vaccination. The subjoined table shows the work done at each dispensary by the' Hospital Assistant in charge:( 13 ) Ellichpur. Balapur. Anjangaon. Shegaon. Darwha. Chikhli. Khamgaon. Most of the dispensaries show an increase in work over that of last year, and a considerable improvement on the returns of previous years. In the seven dis- pensaries mentioned in the margin there has been a falling-off in the numbers operated upon. Civil Surgeons have been directed to report all cases of neglect of this duty by Hospital Assistants; and during the year three men were punished for not paying sufficient attention to vaccination. In estimating dispensary work, however, the proportion of the population protected, or of the estimated birth-rate should be taken, and not the actual numbers operated upon; for dispensary work is entirely confined to the town or village where the dispensary is situated, so the number to be protected annually depends upon the population of the place. That vaccination has been inadequately carried on heretofore in dispen- sary towns may be seen from the table given below comparing the mortality from small-pox in dispensary towns during the past official year with that for other towns and villages in Berar :(14) More attention, however, is now being paid to dispensary vaccination, and Hospital Assistants understand that neglect of this part of their duty will be visited with severe punishment. Small-pox. 12. Small-pox has been very prevalent throughout the province since January last; and during the official year from the 1st April 1882 to 31st March 1883, (the period for which this report is written), there have been 1,910 deaths. The epidemic appears to have prevailed with unusual severity not only all over India, but over the greater part of the world. In India the epidemic, to judge from newspaper accounts, has been most severe, and it will be interesting when the annual mortality figures are published to test and compare the efficiency of vaccination in each province with the history of small-pox. The distribution of the epidemic from the 1st January to 31st March by districts has been :( 15 ) for the time being. The higher classes of Brahmins, even educated men in Government employ, who ought to know better as to the value, the aim, and the object of vaccination, do not willingly bring forward their children, though they affirm they have no religious objection to the operation, and resort to all sorts of excuses to put off the vaccinator. Dr. Hume thus states his experience in the town of Amraoti:( 16 ) out the season. The Deputy Commissioner and Civil Surgeon took an active interest in the work, and their personal influence greatly aided the department. In Akola, the Native Superintendent had considerable difficulty in getting children, no assistance having been rendered by the municipal committee, though solicited by the Superintendent. Aided, however, by the town Chief Constable Dhondji, considerable work was performed and epidemic of small-pox checked. Under these circumstances I would urge that vaccination be made com- pulsory in municipalities. With the recollection of this epidemic of small- pox fresh in their minds, the present time seems opportune for the introduce tion of such a measure, which in the course of time could be extended to all other towns. Notice of officers who gave aid to the Vaccination Department. 15. Much assistance was received from the undermentioned gentlemen, and I beg to bring their names to the favourable notice of the Resident:APPENDICES.

FROM S. O. B. RIDSDALE, ESQUIRE, C. S. Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To THE SECRETARY FOR BERAR TO THE RESIDENT, Hyderabad. DATED AMRAOTI, 31st July 1884. I have the honour to forward the Vaccination Report for the past year 1883-84, which reached me on the 24th instant. 2. The year's work appears to have been as follows, compared with the results of the three preceding years :( 2 ) 6. The work of supervision by the officers of the special department appears to have improved, 61.5 per cent. of the total operations having been verified, against 51 percent. last year, and the work having been inspected in 2,825 villages, against 2,268 in last year's returns. This is creditable. The supervision work, however, performed by Civil Sur- geons is conspicuously defective. In only two districts, Wun and Buldana, was any work of the kind done at all, and only in the latter was the amount of work adequate and satisfactory. No explanation is given. If this work of supervising vaccination in head-quarter circles forms part of the Civil Surgeon's duties, as I understand it does, they should not be permitted to neglect it. 7. The total number of dispensary vaccinations has slightly increased, but in many dispensaries the work performed is very insufficient. Doctor Little observes that Civil Surgeons require to pay more -attention to the point in their quarterly inspections. 8. The employment of the staff of vaccinators on cholera duty was of very great assistance during the prevalence of the epidemic last year. It is one of the principal advantages of the new system of organization, above alluded to, that these men will now be available permanently for employment on duties of this nature during the months when but little vaccination work is possible. 9. Municipalities have been invited to consider the question of making vaccination compulsory within their limits; and the committees of Khamgaon, Shegaon, Akola and Basim, have already passed resolutions for the introduc- tion of a bye-law to this effect. In the municipalities of Amraoti and Ellichpur the matter is still under consideration. If when vaccination has thus been made compulsory in these towns the result can be pointed to that these localities enjoy immunity from small-pox when villages not similarly protected suffer, the effect in the encouragement of vaccina- tion will be practically as great as that of any general measure for making it universally compulsory. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, S. O. B. RIDSDALE, Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts.
No. 109. FROM SURGEON-MAJOR CHARLES LITTLE, M. D., M. C., L. R. C. S., L. M., Sanitary Commissioner, & c., Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To S. O. B. RIDSDALE, ESQUIRE, C. S., Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. DATED AMRAOTI, 23rd June 1884. SIR, I have the honour to submit my annual Report on the working of the Vacci- nation Department of the Hyderabad Assigned Districts for the year 1883-84. Establishment. 2. When the Vaccination Establishment was first organized vaccinators were entertained solely for vaccination work. Vaccine operations were carried on for but six months of the year, from the 1st October to the 31st March, and for the other six months the staff was permitted to return to its home on reduced pay. The majority of the vaccinators had their homes in the Bombay Presidency or the Central Provinces, and but few were residents of Berar. Within the last few years, however, the Vaccination Establishment has, in accordance with the views of Government, been employed on other sanitary duties, and, during cholera epidemics, in distributing medicines amongst the cholera-stricken. Under these changed circumstances of the department, and owing to the difficulty experienced in promptly assembling the vaccinators for cholera duty after they had gone to their homes, it appeared advisable that the establishment should be re-organized, the men being employed throughout the whole year, and compelled to reside within their respective circles, so that not only would the people come to know their vaccinator better, and have more confi- dence in him, but also there would always be a staff ready at hand in each district to be employed on any sanitary duty for which the District Officer or Civil Sur- geon might require of it, or in affording aid to the people during the prevalence of epidemics. In order to effect this without any extra expense to Government, it was pro- posed to re-distribute the vaccination circles, still keeping them conterminous with police circles, but assigning to each a population of about 60,000 inhabi- tants ; thus reducing the number of circles by 13, and the establishment required to work them from 77 to 63. This staff it was proposed to employ throughout the year on full pay for ten months on vaccination work, and for two months, May and June, when the weather is not so favourable for vaccination, in furthering village sanitation under the direction of Civil Surgeons. This reduction of the establishment, some 23 per cent., would not, it was estimated, detrimentally affect the out-turn of work, as the vaccinators would be employed on vaccine operations for ten months instead of for six as heretofore. B254
[ 2 ] This revision of the vaccination establishment, resulting in a saving to Government of Rs. 7 per annum, having been sanctioned by the Resident, was given effect to on the 1st November 1883. The table given below shows the new scale of establishment compared with old scale:[ 3 ] working six months. Next season's work will more fairly compare with that of previous years. (2.) To the very great mortality amongst children during the year. The death-rate amongst infants was 23 per cent., and that amongst children from under one to under five years reached no less than 51.6 per cent. of total deaths. From every circle the complaint was general that there were very few children for vaccination. Statement No. I. 5. Statement No. I. gives full particulars of the year's work performed by the special vaccination establishment, and the subjoined table compares some of the provincial totals with those of the previous year. TABLE No. III.[ 4 ] re-vaccination in each district. The figures for the province for the previous year are shown at the foot of the table for the sake of comparison:[ 5 ] cent. to those successfully vaccinated at those ages : [ 6 ] From this it will be seen that of the total estimated births 29.72 per cent. died under one year of age, 53.09 were vaccinated successfully, and that but 17.19 per cent. remain unprotected. Map and statement. 8. A map and statement showing the work performed by the vaccina- tion establishment in each town and circle are attached. The work performed by each vaccinator both in number and quality varied considerably. The largest number of operations, viz., 3,005, and the highest rate of success, viz., 99.4, were attained by head vaccinator Salsing and 2nd class vaccinator Ahmed Hoosain, respectively. The smallest number of operations, viz., 997, and the lowest rate of success, viz., 80.8, appear against 3rd class vaccinator Vitul Ramchunder and 1st class vaccinator Mahomed Khan, respectively. Those vaccinators who have not worked satisfactorily have been punished. The out-turn of work as recorded in each circle varies considerably. For instance, in the Jowala circle, 173.6 per 1,000 of population was protected, while in the Kingaum circle the rate reached 4.9 only. In the town of Barsi Takli and the circles of Sailoo and Adgaon no vaccination work was performed. The vaccinator of the Adgaon circle, Vitul Ramchunder, was punished for laziness during the year under report. Work of Superintendents. 9. The following table shows the amount of supervision exercised by super- intendents over the work of the vaccination staff in their respective districts :[ 7 ] Superintendent, Mr. Abdul Karim, has been lazy, and has not exerted himself sufficiently. His work compares unfavourably with that of other Superin- tendents. The work of Superintendent Trimbukrao has improved considerably compared with last season's work, but as compared with Ellichpur and Amraoti, there is still room for improvement in the amount of work verified. Work of Civil Surgeons. 10. The inspection work of those Civil Surgeons who have charge of the head-quarter circle vaccination is here shown :[ 8 ] There was an increase in the amount of work performed in the dispensaries of the Ellichpur and Basim Districts, but a falling off in other districts. The average number of cases operated upon by each Hospital Assistant during the year was 173, ranging from 331 at Shegaon to 113 at Chandur in the Amraoti District. 13. The work done at each dispensary is shown below :[ 9 ] Assistants in charge neglected this part of their duty. Civil Surgeons have been called to report on the matter. The results of dispensary vaccination were 89.54 per cent. of success in primary operations, and 42.5 in re-vaccinations, as compared with 87.6 and 31.7 in the preceding year. The percentage of success in primary vaccination is much too low, and it is necessary that Civil Surgeons should pay more attention to vaccination on their quarterly inspections of dispensaries. The best results were obtained in the Wun District with 98 per cent., due to the care and attention bestowed on vacci- nation by the Civil Surgeon, Mr. Chamarett, who has always shown most com- mendable zeal in personally superintending and carrying on the work of vac- cination. Attitude of the people in regard to vaccination. 13. As stated in previous reports there is but little opposition met with in carrying on vaccination in Berar, but the people are apathetic, and it often requires a little pres- sure to make them bring up their children for vaccination. In some of the larger towns much difficulty is experienced amongst Marwa- dis and Mahomedans, with whom the personal influence and persuasive powers of even the Tahsildar have occasionally no effect, and then we are powerless to compel them. It is scarcely fair on the rest of the community that these people should not be compelled to have their children protected against small-pox, and are allowed to thus assist in the perpetuation and spread of this loathsome disease. The remedy for this is to extend the provisions of the Vaccination Act to Berar, as has been done in Madras. Conduct of vaccination staff. 14. The conduct of the vaccination staff throughout the year was satis- factory. I was in camp from November till the middle of March, and was, on the whole, satisfied with the work I inspected. The native Superintendents are efficient and capable, with the exception of native Superintendent Murad Khan, who, owing to physical incapacity, has applied for pension. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, C. LITTLE, M. D., Superintendent of Vaccination, Hyderabad Assigned Districts.

No. 4027 of 1885. FROM LESLIE S. SAUNDERS, ESQ., C. S., Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To THE SECRETARY FOR BERAR TO THE RESIDENT, Hyderabad. DATED AMRAOTI, 11th August 1885. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward the Annual Report on Vaccination in the Hyder- abad Assigned Districts for the year 1884-85, which reached me on the 7th instant. 2. The establishment provided for vaccination having been re-organized in November 1883 with the object of keeping a smaller number of operators work- ing during a greater part of the year, the result of the year cannot be compared with that of the previous year, because the change was introduced too late to admit of the longer period of work counterbalancing the loss by weakening the establishment. Besides, the year itself was unfavourable for vaccination, owing to excessive death-rate among infants. 3. Comparing the work performed by the special vaccination establish- ment during 1884-85 with the average of the five years previous to 1883-84, the total number of operations performed rose to 93,002, against 79,617, and the per- centage of success in primary cases rose from 89.2 to 95.3. 4. The results of the reorganization have so far been satisfactory, and it is gratifying to find that the marked progress of recent years has continued. 5. The total number of operations by special establishment increased in the ratio of 15.1 per cent. in 1882-83, following an increase of 12.5 per cent. in 1881-82. The number of 1884-85 is nearly 18 per cent. higher than the average of five years ending 1882-83, and is greater than that for 1883-84 by 13,798. 6. The total number of operations performed by all establishments was 101,134. or 14,413 in excess of the number of the previous year. Almost all the year's work consisted of first vaccination. The total number was 101,134, and 95,805 of these, or 94.9 per cent., are returned as successful. Last year the per- centage was 92.6, and the year before 91.6, so that with the extension of vaccina- tion the proportion of cases reported successful is steadily increasing. 7. Secondary operations were only 164 in number, and of these 52, or 31.7 per cent., are returned as successful. 8. The agency by which the Department worked during the year, and the total number of operations performed by each class of officers, are detailed in the following table:( 2 ) 9. Basim is the first municipality to set the example of paying a vaccinator out of local funds, and its good example, it is hoped, may be followed by the other municipalities in the province. 10. The very important branch of the work of supervision and inspection of vaccination operations has received both from Civil Surgeons and Native Superin- tendents greater attention during the year. The general results are that 3,437 villages, or 70 per cent. of the total number of villages in which work was carried on, was inspected during the year by Native Superintendents as compared with 2,825 villages, or 62.5 per cent. in the previous year; and 51,135, or 56.2, per cent. of the total vaccinated were verified, while the Civil Surgeons in charge of head-quar- ter stations inspected the work of 96 villages in which operations were performed during the year, against 57 in the previous year, and verified 1,207 cases, against 647 in the previous year. 11. The cost of the Department was Rs. 414 more than in the previous year, being Rs. 16,880, against Rs. 16,466 in the previous year. The cost to Government has been Rs. 16,770, and to Basim Municipality Rs. 110. The average cost of each successful operation was annas three. Last year it was annas 3-6. 12. The statistics of the year's work are, on the whole, satisfactory, and Dr. Little's supervision of the Department has evidently been thoroughly satis- factory. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, LESLIE S. SAUNDERS, Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts.
FROM SURGEON-MAJOR CHARLES LITTLE, M.D., Superintendent of Vaccination, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To LESLIE S. SAUNDERS, ESQUIRE, C. S., Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. Amraoti. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit my Annual Report on the working of the Vaccination Department of the Hyderabad Assigned Districts for the year 1884-85. Establishment. 2. The total strength of the department was the same as last year. The table below shows the establishment employed during the year compared with the sanctioned scale:( 2 ) Gener results. 4. The aggregate number of operations performed by all establishments during the year was 101,134, or 14,413 in excess of the number for the previous year, and 11,132 in excess of the mean for the previous five years. The ratio of successful oper- ations per 1,000 of population was 36.4, as against 30.3 in the preceding year. In primary vaccination the percentage of successful operations was 94.9, as against 92.7, and of the total number successfully vaccinated 73.3 per cent. were under one year of age, as compared with 69.9 in 1883-84. The number of re-vaccina- tions was 164, or 86 less than in the previous year. The work done by the different establishments during 1884-85 is shown below:( 3 ) performed by vaccinators Syed Kassim and Gangadhar Ramkrishna respectively, to 1,529 by vaccinator Hari Ramchandra. The following table gives this information by districts for the past five years, and compares the average operations performed per man for the year under report with the mean of the previous five years:( 4 ) In primary vaccination the highest percentage of success was obtained in the Amraoti District (95.8), and the lowest in the Ellichpur District (95.0). The percentages for each district are very similar, but the rate for the province has increased from 92.9 in the previous year to 95.3 during the year under report. The percentage of unsuccessful and doubtful cases has fallen from 3.6 to 2.8, the highest rate of unsuccess (3.0) being returned from the Akola District. There has also been a decrease of 1.6 per cent. in the number of unknown or unverified cases returned. The highest percentage of unverified work was 2.5, and occurred in the Buldana District. This decrease in the number of unsuccessful and unknown cases is satisfac- tory, and indicates more careful work on the part of the vaccinators and better supervision on the part of Superintendents. The new system, under which vaccinators work for a longer period and visit the villages in their circles more frequently, may also have contributed to this result, as fewer children can now escape verification, and those in which the oper- ation has proved doubtful or unsuccessful are secondarily operated upon. For- merly the results of these unsuccessful cases were frequently not recorded, though seen by the vaccinator, and they thus went to swell the number of cases returned as unknown, the object being to show as little unsuccessful work as possible, the men apparently overlooking the fact that an unknown case is reckoned as unsuc- cessful in calculating the percentage of success. The number of re-vaccinations performed was 82, with a ratio of success of 15.8 as compared with 210 and 34.8 respectively in the previous year. There is great reluctance amongst the people to re-vaccination, and therefore it is not considered advisable to push the work in this direction with the feelings of the people so much against it. If infantile vaccination is well carried out, and a fair proportion of children under one year of age annually protected, it is all that can be expected for the present, and when the people begin to see and appreciate more fully the benefits of vaccination then re-vaccination may be resorted to more generally. The percentage of success in re-vaccination (15.8) is low, as might be expected, and may be taken as corroborative of the accuracy with which the results of vaccine operations are recorded. Sex of those vaccinated. 8. Of the sex of those vaccinated 47,489 were males and 46,028 females, giving a proportion to total vaccinated of 50.8 males and 49.2 females, as compared with 50.7 and 49.3 respectively in the previous year. The following table shows all particu- lars regarding the sex of those vaccinated:( 5 ) Age of those vaccinated. 9. The next table gives the numbers successfully vaccinated according to age and the proportion vaccinated at these ages:( 6 ) The largest proportion of the population protected was in the Ellichpur and Wun Districts, where the ratio of success was 38.9 and 38.6 respectively, and lowest in Akola, where the rate attained was only 32.6. The average for the province was 36.4, as compared with 30.3 in the previous year. The percentage of infants successfully vaccinated to estimated annual birth- rate, which is the best gauge of the amount of protection afforded, was 66.6, against 53.0 in 1883-84. Here again Ellichpur takes first place, with the high rate of 84.4 per cent., while Basim is last with 59.0. The percentage of estimated births successfully vaccinated in Berar compares favourably with the figures for other provinces extracted below from the Annual Report of the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India for 1883:( 7 ) The Basim, Akola and Buldana Superintendents ought to have been able to visit a larger percentage of the villages in their districts in which vaccination work was carried on. Their attention will be called to this point. The next table shows the inspection work performed by Civil Surgeons in charge of head-quarter stations:( 8 ) Of the total number vaccinated 7,535 were primary operations, and 82 re-vac- cinations, and the percentage of success attained was 90. and 47.6 respectively, as compared with 89.5 and 42.5 in the preceding year. The table below shows the work done at each dispensary by the hospital assistant in charge:( 9 ) The percentage of population and of estimated births protected at dispen- saries was 30.4 and 60.1, as compared with 37. and 66.6 respectively, the average attained by the special vaccination department. From this it is evident that relatively the work performed at dispensaries is very fair. This result has not, however, been attained without much driving of hospital assistants, who complain that they cannot find the time to go about from house to house, and that no help can be obtained by them from tahsil and village officials.

FROM LESLIE S. SAUNDERS, ESQUIRE, C. S., Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To THE SECRETARY FOR BERAR TO THE RESIDENT, Hyderabad. DATED AMRAOTI, 2nd July 1886. SIR, I have the honour to submit the Vaccination Report for the year 1885-86, which reached me on the 28th ultimo. 2. The total number of operations amounted in the year under notice to 97,654, against 101,134 in 1884-85. Of these, 91,004 were performed by the special establishment and 6,560 by the medical subordinates attached to the dispensaries. But although there was thus a falling-off in the number of operations, it is satisfactory to find that the proportion of infants protected by this means to the total number successfully vaccinated was 78.0 per cent., against 72.9 in 1884-85. The percentage of success in the operations by the special estab- lishment was 95.6 in primary cases and 26.3 in re-vaccinations, while in dispensary vaccinations the ratio of success was 91.4 in primary cases and 76.6 per cent. in re-vaccinations. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator was 2,175, the greatest number by any one vaccinator being 2,834. 3. Of the total number of operations, 63.7 per cent. were verified by the Native Superintendents in 3,619 villages, against 56.2 per cent. in 3,437 villages in 1884-85. It is observed that there has been a falling-off in the inspection work of Civil Surgeons, especially in the Wun District. 4. The total expenditure incurred on account of vaccination rose from Rs. 16,880 to Rs. 17,027, and the average cost of each successful case rose from Annas 3 to Annas 3-1. 5. As stated in previous reports, there is but little opposition met in carry- ing on vaccination in Berar. The Sanitary Commissioner brought to notice that, in a case of refusal of a certain individual to have his child vaccinated, a Deputy Commissioner passed an order that a man cannot be forced to have his child vaccinated. It is no doubt true that vaccination is not legally compulsory in Berar, but at the same time Government has directed that district officers and all civil officials should exert their personal influence in aiding the cause of vaccina- tion. The attention of all Deputy Commissioners has been drawn to Section V. of the Vaccination Rules published in Resident's Book Circular No. XI. of 1879, and they have been informed that in cases of difficulty and obstruction to vacci- nation, they are not called on to publicly promulgate the fact that a man cannot legally be obliged to have his children vaccinated, but that they should rather endeavour, by a little judicious pressure, to remove all such difficulties when brought to their notice. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, LESLIE S. SAUNDERS, Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. B170
FROM SURGEON-MAJOR C. LITTLE, M. D., Superintendent of Vaccination, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To L. S. SAUNDERS, ESQ., C. S., Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. SIR, I have the honour to submit the Annual Vaccination Returns of the Hyder- abad Assigned Districts for the year 1885-86, together with a brief report on the working of the department. Establishment. 2. There was no change in the special vaccination staff during theyear, which was kept up to the full sanctioned strength. The Basim Municipality dispensed with the services of the vaccinator employed by that body owing to the man's inefficiency, and as the work of the Basim town was not sufficient for one man, it was undertaken by the special vaccination department. The conduct of the vaccinators was, on the whole, satisfactory; and consider- ing the difficulties they often meet with, there is little or no friction between these men and the villagers, which speaks creditably for the morale of the department. Seventeen punishments were inflicted during the year. One vaccinator was reduced for bad work and sixteen were fined, one for disobedience to the orders of his Superintendent, one for allowing his lymph to deteriorate, and the remainder for slow progress. Lymph. 3. Both humanized and animal lymph were kept up throughout the year; but at the commencement of the cold weather some tubes of animal lymph were obtained from Bombay. This lymph was propagated successfully at Amraoti, and supplies sent out to each district, animal vaccination being kept up at head-quarters till each Superintendent reported that he had established a good working supply in his district. In some districts a continuous supply of animal lymph has been kept up throughout the year; but as there is often difficulty in getting a conti- nuous supply of calves this is not insisted on, since animal lymph can generally be obtained from the Superintendent of Vaccination, Presidency Circle, Bombay, free of cost. Season's work. 4. In the year under report the aggregate number of operations performedby all establishments, special vaccination establish- ment, and dispensaries, was 97,654, as compared with 101,134 in the previous year, being a decrease of 3,480. The total number of successful primary operations was 93,027, as against 95,805, and the ratio of success 95.4, compared with 94.9 in 1884-85. The falling-off in the numbers vaccinated is attributable to 23 vaccinators having been employed on cholera duty for varying periods up to three months. B113( 2 ) When cholera is prevalent these men, supplied with medicines by the Civil Sur- geon of the District, itinerate through their circles, giving aid to the cholera- stricken, and when on such duty, their vaccination work is necessarily at a stand- still. There was also a decrease in dispensary vaccination which will be noticed further on. Annual Statement No. I. 5. This statement shows the particulars of the year's work performed bythe special vaccination establishment only, and the following abstract compares some of the principal totals with those of the previous year:( 3 ) The percentage of unsuccessful and unknown cases are less than in the previous year. Under these two heads there is room for improvement in the Basim and Buldana Districts. The number of re-vaccinations performed was 38, with a percentage of success of 26.3. Sex and age of those vaccinated. 7. Of the sex of those vaccinated 46,155 were males and 44,939 females,the proportion to total vaccinated being for males 56.7, and for females 49.3, as compared with 50.8 and 49.2 in the previous year. Of the ages of those successfully vaccinated 68,076 were under one year, 18,213 between one and six years, and 816 above six years and adults. The ratios per cent. to total vaccinated at these ages were 78.0, 20.9, and .9 respectively, as compared with 72.9, 25.7, and 1.4 in the preceding year :( 4 ) This table would show that the proportion of the population successfully vac- cinated was 85.3 per thousand, that the percentage of estimated births protected was 69.3, and that only 8.4 per cent. of infants under one year of age remained unprotected. The fallacy in this table is that it assumes that none of the infants vacci- nated were amongst those who died ; that the great proportion were unvacci- nated is very probable, considering the number of infants who die under three months old before they could have been operated on. However, gauged by the proportion of the births successfully vaccinated, it shows a large degree of protection against small-pox, and compares favourably, it may be remarked, with the figures for the other provinces in India( 5 ) Of the total number vaccinated 58,037, or 63.7 per cent., were verified by Superintendents, as compared with 56.2 in the previous year, and of the villages in which work was performed 67.5 per cent. were visited, against 70. in 1884-85. The percentage of the work verified was, as usual, highest in the Ellichpur District, by, Superintendent Ajaj Hoosein ; but as before remarked, this is the smallest district, with the smallest number of villages, and again the villages are situated closer together than in the other districts, which gives the Ellichpur Superintendent an advantage which it is evident he has not neglected. The work performed in the Amraoti District under Superintendent Moorad Ally is very good, and there is considerable improvement in the work of the Akola and Buldana Superintendents Trimbuck Rao and Dinkar Rao, for which they deserve credit. On the whole Superintendents have worked well, and with, perhaps, one exception, they are trustworthy and efficient men who do their work honestly, and exercise a capable and essential control over their vaccinators. The inspection work performed by Civil Surgeons in charge of head-quarter stations is shown in the following table :( 6 ) The percentage of success obtained in dispensary vaccination was primary vaccination 91.4, re-vaccination 76.6, as compared with 95.6 and 26.3 for the special establishment. The proportion of results obtained in re-vaccination is suspiciously high, and though repeatedly explained to them, hospital assistants would appear to confuse secondary operations with re-vaccinations. The attention of Civil Surgeons will again be called to this point. Attitude of the people. 13. As has been stated in previous reports there is, barring municipalities,no opposition experienced to vaccination in Berar, and a vaccinator working with tact and care will seldom meet with any difficulty which his Superintendent cannot assist him in removing. In some few instances recalcitrants are doubtless met with, and here a little judicious official pressure is essential lest from the force of example oppo- sition should spread. If this cannot be accorded, then it would be advisable to extend the Compulsory Vaccination Act to Berar, which could now be introduced without any difficulty or hardship to the people. It is difficult for the Vaccina- tion Department to work smoothly with the people and yet show a good record, if, in such cases where decided opposition is met with, the civil authorities can- not enforce vaccination, and when appealed to, as in a case of the sort which occurred lately, can only reply that vaccination is voluntary. In municipalities I have long urged that vaccination should be made com- pulsory, and this might be easily done by the insertion of a bye-law in the Municipal Rules, as suggested by Mr. Ridsdale in para. 6 of his remarks on the Dispensary Report for 1882. This might not be acceptable to municipalities or rather to municipal committees as at present constituted, for it is almost entirely amongst the better classes of the community that opposition is met with, the castes which mostly object being Mahomedans, Marwarries, Rajputs, and Brahmins. It would therefore be necessary for the Government to extend the Act to our municipalities, and direct the insertion of the necessary bye-law. Conclusion. 14.

From LESLIE S. SAUNDERS, ESQ., C.S., Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To THE SECRETARY FOR BERAR TO THE RESIDENT, Hyderabad. DATED AMRAOTI, 13th July 1887. SIR, I have the honour to forward the Vaccination Report for the past year 1886-87, which reached me on the 3rd instant. 2. The year's work (including the operations performed in Melghat) appears to have been as follows, compared with the results of the three preceding years:( 2 ) 5. The vaccination establishments remain the same as they had been for the previous year. Their total cost was Rs. 17,119-11-4, all of which was paid from provincial funds. The average cost for each successful operation for the province was Annas 3-3, against Annas 3-1 in former year. The average cost varied from Annas 2-6, the minimum, in the Amraoti District, to Annas 3-8, the maximum, in the Ellichpur District. 6. More vaccination work was done at dispensaries during 1886-87 than in the preceding year, and this is satisfactory. The percentage of successful pri- mary vaccinations was 92.3, that of secondary vaccinations 58.3 per cent. It may be noticed that the percentage of successful primary vaccinations are lower than those returned by the special establishment by 4 per cent. Compared with the previous year, the number of operations at dispensaries has risen generally; operations in the Buldana District only have somewhat fallen off. The Superin- tendent of Vaccination has omitted to notice in this Report the negligence in vaccine operations in the town of Khamgaon, which was imputed by him to the medical officer of the dispensary there. I have already referred to the matter in my remarks on the Sanitary Report for 1886 now before the Resident, and I hope such neglect of duty will not again occur. 7. The attitude of the people towards vaccination has improved, and it is gratifying to find that Dr. Little is able to record his satisfaction at the way his own establishment have worked and for the assistance he has received at the hands of the native gentlemen named in the concluding paragraph of his Report. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, LESLIE S. SAUNDERS, Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned. Districts.
FROM SURGEON-MAJOR CHARLES LITTLE, M.D., Superintendent of Vaccination, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To L. S. SAUNDERS, ESQ., C.S., Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. SIR, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report on the working of the Vacci- nation Department of the Hyderabad Assigned Districts for the year 1886-87. Strength of department. 2. The strength of the department was the same as last year. Establishment. 3. During the year under report one vaccinator was put on the pension list, two were dismissed, and one died. These vacancies were filled up by promoting the most deserving of the apprentices trained for the purpose in the department. Conduct of the staff. 4. The conduct of the department throughout the year was on the whole satisfactory, with one exception, which is under investigation. Punishment. 5. In all 22 punishments were inflicted: 14 fines, 5 reductions, 2 dismissals, and 1 suspension. These men were punished chiefly for allowing their lymph to die out and for slow progress. Lymph. 6. Humanized lymph was kept up in all districts throughout the year. But in October it was renewed by means of retro- vaccination. In the Akola Municipality vaccine operations were entirely carried on with animal lymph, calves being arranged for by the Vice-President, Mr. Deorao Vinayek, who takes an active interest in the work. In the Amraoti Municipality humanized lymph had to be used owing to the Municipal Committee being unable to keep up the neccssary supply of calves. Some of the towns-people, however, took their children for vaccination to a place six miles distant from Amraoti, where animal lymph was procurable. Season's work. 7. The aggregate number of operations performed by all establishments in 1886-87 was 95,504, as compared with 97,654 in the previous year, being a decrease of 2,150. The total number of successful primary operations was 91,470, as against 93,027, and the ratio of success obtained 95.8, against 95.4 in 1885-86. The above includes the operations performed in Melghat, for which tract there is no special establishment. At the request of the Deputy Commissioner of the Ellichpur District, Colonel Mackenzie, four vaccinators were deputed to work in the Melghat for six weeks during the hot season. These men were placed under B-96
( 2 ) the orders of Mr. Ballantyne, the Forest Officer of the Division, who kindly offered to assist, and it was almost entirely due to his influence amongst the timid people inhabiting this part of the province that the vaccinators were able to perform any work, for unless a vaccinator was accompanied by a Forest official or some one they trusted, the people fled to the jungles on his approaching a village. Desirability of having special vac- cinators for the Melghat. 8. The climate of the Melghat is very unhealthy, and no one coming from the plains escapes the fever, which is very fatal. Though the hot season is the healthiest time of the year in this malarious tract, yet all the four vaccinators suffered from the fever on their return to the plains and were incapa- citated for duty thereby for periods varying up to two months; in the case of one man an enlarged spleen, which is slow to yield to treatment, still remains as a memento of his visit to the Melghat. It will probably be necessary to specially entertain some men inured to the climate as vaccinators for the Melghat. The work performed in the Melghat is shown below:( 3 ) TABLE No. 3.( 4 ) Of the total number successfully vaccinated, 75.6 per cent. were infants under one year of age, ranging from 89 per cent. in the Ellichpur District to 68.9 in Basim; 23.3 per cent. were between one and six years, and 1.1 per cent. above six years. The following table shows the estimated number and proportion of births protected and unprotected by vaccination in each district during the year :( 5 ) The above goes to show that there has been improvement in the amount of inspection work done by Superintendents, as compared with last year's figures. Of the total vaccinated, 66.9 per cent. were verified, as compared with 63.7 in 1885, and of the villages in which work was performed, 80.2 per cent. were visited, against 67.5 in the previous year. The increase in inspection work was general in each district, save Akola, where the percentage of verified cases fell from 66.3 in 1885 to 58.3 in the year under report. The District Superintendent attributes the decrease to his inspections being interrupted owing to the occurrence of small-pox in some of the towns of his district. This explanation is, however, not quite satisfactory. Notice of Superintendents. 13. The work performed by the vaccination staff in the Amraoti, Ellichpur, and Buldana Districts during the year under re- port is satisfactory, and Superintendents Murad Ali, Ajaj Hoosein, and Dinker Rao have all done well, especially the latter. There is considerable improvement in the work of the Basim and Wun Districts, for which Superintendents Syed Abdul Kareem and Grangadharam deserve com- mendation. The Akola District, tried by every test, stands last, and it is not creditable to 2nd Class Superintendent Trimbuck Rao that he cannot work up his district better, and it will be a matter for consideration whether he should not be transferred to a smaller district. First Class Superintendent Bapu Rao, attached to Sanitary Commissioner's office, and who conducts the vernacular work of the department, performed his duties with care and judgment to my entire satisfac- tion. Inspection by Civil Surgeons. 14. The following table shows the inspection work done by Civil Surgeons in their respective head-quarter circles during the year : ( 6 ) The increase was general in each district, save that of Buldana, where the number fell from 1,534 to 1,435. The percentage of success in dispensary vaccination was 92.3 in primary vaccination and 58.3 in re-vaccination. The definition of re-vaccination is apparently not yet understood by some Hospital Assistants, and Civil Surgeons will again be asked to draw their atten- tion to this point. The work performed at each dispensary town is shown in the following table:( 7 ) population of the province, and explanation has been called for from Civil Sur- geons in all cases where the proportion of the population protected is below 35.6 per 1,000, the average obtained by the vaccine department.

READ( 2 ) 8. The number of vaccinations at dispensaries rose from 6,560 to 7,238, approaching closely the figures of 1884-85. 9. Table No. 9 is of importance as giving the death-rates from small-pox per 1,000 of the population, year by year, for the past 19 years. Taking the mean of the three first periods of five years, there is a steady and satisfactory decrease, which, unless there is an abnormal amount of this sickness during 1887, gives every promise of being continuous. In this respect Berar compares favourably with most other Provinces. 10. In conclusion the Resident has much pleasure in acknowledging the assistance given to the Vaccination Department by the officials, patels, and pandias who are specially mentioned in the concluding paragraph of the Report.

REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE HYDERABAD ASSIGNED DISTRICTS, FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1887-88. BY SURGEON-MAJOR C. LITTLE, M. D. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Hyderabad : PRINTED AT THE RESIDENCY GOVERNMENT PRESS. 1888. Price 8 annas per copy.
No. 3849 OF 1888. FROM COLONEL H. C. A. SZCZEPANSKI, Officiating Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To THE SECRETARY FOR BERAR TO THE RESIDENT, Hyderabad. DATED AMRAOTI, 10th July 1888. SIR, I have the honour to forward herewith a short note by Dr. Little on the operations of the Vaccination Department during the year 1887-88. 2. The results may be thus summarized and compared with the figures of the previous year. The total number of operations performed by the special vaccination establishment was 90,311, against 88,266 in the previous year, being an increase of 2,045. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vacci- nator was 2,150, or 2.3 per cent. more than in 1886-87. Percentage of successful cases of primary vaccination was 96.5 and in re-vaccination 45.4, against 96.2 and 19.4 respectively in 1886-87. The increase in re-vaccination is satisfactory. 3. The number of vaccine operations performed at dispensaries was 391 less than in 1886-87. Except in Amraoti, the decrease was general in all the districts of the province. In Basim alone the decrease was 38.3 per cent. 4. The number of vaccine operations in the Melghat was 2,318 against 1,332, or 986 more than in the previous year; the percentage of successful cases, however, was not as good as that of the last year, being 91.5 per cent., against 93.4 in 1886-87. 5. This year also, it is satisfactory to observe, there has been an appreci- able increase in infant vaccination. The total number of children under one year who were vaccinated was 68,104, against 63,148 in 1886-87, or in other words there was an increase of 7.8 per cent. The proportion of vaccination to births registered was 68.8. 6. The expenditure of the department was Rs. 350 less than in the previ- ous year, and the cost of each successful case was less by two pies. 7. Except the two Superintendents mentioned in paragraph 3 of Dr. Little's note, the Vaccination Staff appears to have worked well. The Civil Surgeons of Basim and Wun have as usual performed their duties satisfactorily, but it is a matter for regret that, notwithstanding the remarks made by the Resident in his reviews on the reports for the last and previous years, the other Civil Surgeons appear to have paid so little attention to this part of their duty, and some expla- nation should have been demanded of the Civil Surgeons of Amraoti and Akola, and especially of the latter, for the apparent neglect in supervising the work of one of the departments entrusted to their care. B122
( 2 ) The general results are satisfactory, and I support Dr. Little's recommend- ation that the three vaccinators named in paragraph 7 of his note may be granted a bonus of Rs. 30 each. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, H. C. A. SZCZEPANSKI, Officiating Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts.
FROM SURGEON-MAJOR C. LITTLE, M.D., Superintendent of Vaccination, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To COLONEL H. C. A. SZCZEPANSKI, Officiating Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. DATED 16th June 1888. SIR, I have the honour to submit the annual statistical returns of the Vaccination Department, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, with brief notes thereon, in accord- ance with paragraph 5 of Government of India's Resolution in the Home Depart- ment, No. 28( 2 ) The ratio of success attained in the several districts ranged from 98.3 in the Amraoti District to 95.3 in the Basim District. Four districts show an increase in work and two (Akola and Buldana) a decrease as compared with the returns for the previous year. The sickness of the Superintendent in the Akola District and the fact that the vaccinators of the Buldana District were employed on cholera duty up to the end of October would in a measure account for the falling-off in work in these districts. Statement No. II. 3. The strength of the establishment and the number posted to each district were the same as last year. The conduct of the staff was on the whole good, with the exception of one vaccinator, Delawar Khan, who, whilst employed in the Melghat, oppressed and extorted money from the Kurkoo villagers in a most audacious manner, amongst other things threatening to use poisoned lymph if his demands were not com- plied with. The man was tried for the offence, and, being found guilty, was sentenced to 18 months' rigorous imprisonment and a fine of 300 rupees. The District Superintendents, with the exception of two, Mr. Trimbuck Rao of the Akola District and Mr. Dinkar Rao of the Buldana District, have worked satis- factorily during the year. It is usual to recommend for reward the three first vaccinators on the list who have done the best work during the season. The men who this year head the list are:( 3 ) The Superintendent of the Ellichpur District with five vaccinators worked in the Melghat for a period of two months, during which time 2,318 persons were vaccinated with a ratio of success of 91.5 per cent. Melghat is not under regis- trati on, and is not included in the area for which the vaccination establishment was sanctioned. The work performed in this tract during the year has however been shown in Statement No. I. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, C. LITTLE, M.D., Superintendent of Vaccination. Hyderabad Assigned Districts.

Read- Report upon Vaccination in the Hyderabad Assigned Districts for the year 1887-88. RESOLUTION. Considerable progress was effected in the year under report in almost every direction. The total number of operations performed was higher than that of the previous year, as was the average number performed by each operator. An improvement was also effected in the percentages of successful cases; the figures being 96.5 per cent. in primary operations and 45.4 in re-vaccinations, against 96.2 and 19.4 respectively in the preceding year. The figures would be very satisfactory if they could be relied upon; but it is noted that Dr. Little himself throws doubts on some of the percentages, and this to some extent discredits the entire return. In re-vaccinations, in which the province has hitherto been con- spicuously backward, the increase is remarkable, and it is gratifying to learn from, paragraph 2 of his report that the subject has Dr. Little's full attention. The misconduct of the vaccinator Dilawar Khan, reported in paragraph 3, is how- ever much to be regretted, as a single occurrence of the kind, especially among a simple rural community like the Kurkus, spreads distrust and aversion to a degree that will take years of careful and competent work to eradicate. It may be hoped that Dilawar Khan was replaced by a more carefully selected operator. The falling off in dispensary vaccination is also to be regretted, but this is what might be expected from the generally inefficient management of these institutions already commented on in the Dispensary Report. 2. Dr. Little does not explain the system of operations adopted, but appa- rently both in the Melghat and the other districts the vaccinators go from village to village distributing their work equally over the whole area entrusted to them. Where, however, vaccination has been most successful, it has been effected by con- centrating operations and thereby giving complete immunity from small-pox to a particular locality, which thus stands out, especially in seasons of epidemic, in notable contrast with the surrounding towns and villages and so ensures repute and confidence in the prophylactic. This was Dr. Pearson's very successful system in Rohilkhund in the North West Provinces, and Dr. Little might consider whether at the beginning or end of the working season it would not be possible to concentrate operations in a specially selected town or village in, each, district without detriment to the rest of the area in each charge. 3. It cannot be regarded as satisfactory that the inspections of the Civil Surgeons of all the districts (except that of Basim) were quite inadequate, and to this laxity no doubt the falling off in the work done at the dispensaries was due. A similar neglect of duty was noticed in 1886-87, and the Officiating Resident desires that the Sanitary Commissioner will obtain specific explanations on the subject from the Civil Surgeons of Buldana, Ellichpur, Akola, and Amraoti, while in the current year he should at once take practical measures to see that a proper amount of inspection work by Civil Surgeons is carried out. 4. The Officiating Resident has pleasure in sanctioning the rewards pro- posed for Raoji Govind, Sher Mahomed, and Raoji Vishnu, and is gratified to observe that Govind and Vishnu earned the Sanitary Commissioner's commend- ations in the previous year. The thanks of the Officiating Resident are due to Dr. Little for the improvement in the results exhibited by his department in the year under review. (By order.) G. S. FORBES, Secretary for Berar.

REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE HYDERABAD ASSIGNED DISTRICTS FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1888-89. BY SURGEON-MAJOR CHARLES LITTLE, M.D. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Hyderabad : PRINTED AT THE RESIDENCY GOVERNMENT PRESS. 1889. Price 1 Rupee per copy.
No. 91 OF 1889. FROM T. CHICHELE PLOWDEN, ESQ., C. S., Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To THE SECRETARY FOR BERAR TO THE RESIDENT, Hyderabad. DATED CHIKALDA, 14th June 1889. SIR, As requested in your endorsement No. 1834-M of the 5th June 1889, I have the honour to return Dr. Little's notes on the annual vaccination statistics for 1888-89 and to submit the following remarks. 2. Statement I.( 2 ) still less complete than it ought to be. In Amraoti and Ellichpur the percent- age of verified cases was 45.9 and 41.6 respectively, which is much below the standard, while in Akola it was only 15.5 ; but the Sanitary Commissioner men- tions that the attention of the new Civil Surgeon of this district is being specially directed to this matter. 7. The rewards recommended in paragraph 14 to the three vaccinators named may be sanctioned. And as to the long roll of officials and native gentlemen who have shown interest in vaccination work, it is not said in what special way they have rendered aid, and I think that an expression of the thanks of Govern- ment should be sufficient. But as to the &quot; black&quot; list in section 20, I will tell the Deputy Commissioners concerned to send for and reprimand the patels whose names are given. 8. I observe that the &quot; brief notes&quot; prescribed in para. 5 (ii) of Home Depart- ment Resolution of the 15th July 1887 have expanded from 6 paras. to 21 paras. and there are also three additional statistical appendices together with a memo by the Civil Surgeon of Buldana. Hence it appears to me that the &quot; notes &quot; have attained the dimensions of an ordinary report. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, T. CHICHELE PLOWDEN, Commissioner. Hyderabad Assigned Districts.
FROM SURGEON-MAJOR C. LITTLE, M.D., Superintendent of Vaccination, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, To T. J. CHICHELE PLOWDEN., ESQ., C.S., Commissioner, Hyderabad Assigned Districts. SIR, I have the honour to submit the annual statistical returns of the Vaccination Department, Hyderabad Assigned Districts, with brief notes thereon, in accordance with paragraph 5 of Government of India Resolution in the Home Department No. 28( 2 ) Test experiments were also undertaken both in calves inoculated with variolous lymph and in children vaccinated from these calves by re-vaccinating them with humanized lymph, but in every instance the result was failure, showing that the system was protected. Good lymph( 3 ) Average work of each vaccinator. 7. The average number of operations per- formed by each vaccinator was 2,288, as compared with 2,150 in 1887-88. Primary vaccination results. 8. In primary vaccination 88,833, or 96.4 per cent., proved successful. Age. 9. Of these, 70,281 were infants under one year of age, 16,644 between one and six years, and 1,908 children above six and adults. The ratios per cent. to total success- fully vaccinated at these ages were 79.1, 18.7, and 2.2 respectively as compared with 79.9, 19, and 1.1 for the previous year. Proportion of births protected. 10. The proportion of the births (estimated at 40 per 1,000 of the population) successfully protected was 73.1 per cent. Re-vaccination results. 11. During the year 3,960 persons were re-vaccinated, against 335 in 1887-88. The number of successful cases was 1,533, or 387 per cent, against 45.4 in the preced- ing year. The work of re-vaccination has received attention in every district except Basim. The attention of this Superintendent will be again drawn to the Government orders on the subject. Proportion of population protected. 12. The proportion of the population successfully vaccinated including the work at dispensaries was 36.9 per cent., as compared with 34.6 in the previous year. The average annual number of persons successfully vaccinated during the previous five years was 34.2 per cent., and the average annual number of deaths from small-pox in the same period was .28. Statement No. II( 4 ) The ratio of success attained was 95.5 per cent. in primary cases and in re-vaccination 39.3 as compared with 93.3 and 83.6 in the previous year. The proportion of success reported in re-vaccination is more reliable than hereto- fore, and closely approximates the results obtained in the British Army. Inspections by District Superintend- ents of Vaccination. 16. The inspection work done by District Superintendents was fairly satisfactory. The proportion of villages visited to the total number in which work was perform- ed in the province was 72.9 per cent. and the percentage of cases verified to total operations 56.6, ranging from 69.5 and 69.1 in the Ellichpur and Buldana Districts to 44.9 in the Basim District. The improvement observable in the work of the Akola District as compared with last year is creditable to the Superintendent concerned. Inspection of dispensary vaccina- tion by Civil Surgeons. 17. At dispensaries Civil Surgeons in- spected 47.1 per cent. of the total operations as shown below:( 5 ) List of Officials and Non-officials who rendered assistance to the cause of Vaccination during 1888-89.

The results of the work shown as performed at dispensaries are better in every way than those of the previous year. The total of vaccinations shows an increase of 2,297, of which 417 were re-vaccinations, against 98 in 1887-88. The percentage of successful re-vaccinations (39.3) is probably much nearer the truth than that (83.6) given last year, which was pointed out by the Government of India to be an unprecedented figure. 5. The inspection work done by District Superintendents was fairty satis- factory. The smallest outturn of work was done by the District Superintendent of Basim, in whose district operations fell off by 531 owing in some measure to misconduct and dilatoriness on the part of vaccinators, which may be attributed to inadequate supervision. At dispensaries the inspection of Civil Surgeons, though better than last year, was still less than it ought to be. In Amraoti and Ellichpur the percent- age of verified cases was 45.9 and 41.6 respectively, which is much below the standard, while in Akola it was only 15.5. The Resident has, in reviewing the two preceding reports, specially called the attention of Civil Surgeons to this im- portant duty. Civil Surgeons are expected to verify at least 75 per cent. of the vaccine operations performed at dispensaries, and the Resident expects this duty to be fully carried out in future. 6. It should, Mr. Howell is of opinion, be the object of Government to sup- ply the people, at the district dispensaries as centres, with good vaccinators and to encourage them to come to these centres to be vaccinated. This should be the direction in which a large expansion of operations should be looked for. The Government cannot in Berar or elsewhere keep up a special staff adequate for the entire work to be done. This is only practicable on a comparatively small scale. The bulk of the work must be done at the centres, to which the people should be persuaded in their own interest to resort. The special vaccinators will be fully employed in visiting the more remote outlying villages and country. 7. Mr. Howell notes that in Berar the greatest number of operations are performed during the seven cold-weather months from October to April, whereas in the Hyderabad Residency District, which is the head-quarters of vaccination operations for the Contingent and throughout His Highness the Nizam's domi- nions, the greater part of the work is done during the hot months of the year( 3 ) 11. The Resident has much pleasure in acknowledging the assistance given to the Vaccination Department by the native gentlemen whose names are mentioned in section 19 of Dr. Little's report, and the services of the officials brought to notice in paragraph 21. 12. The record of the year's operations under Dr. Little's superintendence shows that considerable progress has been effected, and is on the whole satis- factory. (By order.) F. L. PETRE, Secretary for Berar.
