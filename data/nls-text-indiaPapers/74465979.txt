THE PROTECTION OF INDIA FROM YELLOW FEVER. 474DE
?THE PROTECTION OF INDIA FROM YELLOW FEVER. Yellow fever has not yet appeared in India, but the abundant presence of the mosquito (stegomyia fasciata) which transmits it, the susceptibility of the population, and the general conditions in the chief seaports are very favourable to its existence and spread, and it is believed that the introduction of the virus would be followed by devastating epidemics which would be exceedingly difficult to control. In 1903 Sir Patrick Manson drew prominent attention to the risk that the commercial developments which will follow the opening of the Panama Canal may lead to the introduction of the disease into Asia, and in June 1911 the danger to India was discussed in an important paper by Major F. F. Gordon Tucker, I.M.S., Professor of Pathology in the Grant Medical College, Bombay. In order that first-hand information, which would be useful in devising timely measures, might be available, I was deputed by the Government of India in October 1911 to ascertain the conditions in a portion of the endemic area in Central America, and in the principal seaports between that country and India. The route by which I travelled and the names of the places visited are shown on the accompanying map, and I have detailed in the last section of this report, the information I was able to collect. For the remainder of my report I propose to summarize briefly the opinions at which I have arrived regarding the degree of danger of the introduction of yellow fever into India, and regarding the measures which might be taken at present. I. The first ideas that come to one's mind on examining a map of the World, or of the Pacific Ocean, prepared on Mercator's projection, are that the Panama Canal will provide a direct route to Asia and India from Europe, the United States and the endemic area of yellow fever, and that after the canal is open for traffic there will be a danger of yellow fever being conveyed to India by direct shipping to that country from, or by way of, ports in the endemic area on the Atlantic side of the canal. But charts on Mercator's projection give a distorted view of the features of the earth and a wrong impression of the shortest distances between most ports, so that in order to ascertain whether our first ideas are tenable, and to enable the problem with which India is concerned to be accurately stated, it will be convenient to begin the attempt to estimate the degree of risk of the introduction of yellow fever into that country with a tabular record of the shortest distances between certain ports. This information is contained in the following statement, which has been spaced with a view to show that problems of   the East  are sometimes only very indirectly problems of India.

Considering first only the columns of the table relating to Indian ports, the following conclusions may be drawn:- (1) The opening of the Panama Canal is not likely to be followed by direct traffic from Europe through the endemic area to India, for the distance between London and India is on an average 10, 500 miles longer by the new route than by way of the Suez Canal. This is important because most of India's seaborne trade is with Europe. (2) It is not likely to be followed by direct traffic from the United States through the endemic area to India, for New York is on an average 6,800 miles, and New Orleans 3,200 miles, nearer to India by way of Suez than by way of Panama. (3) It is not likely to be followed by direct traffic from the endemic area via Panama to India, for much the shortest routes to that country from the West Indies, Mexico, the Central American Republics, the Panama canal zone, Columbia, Venezuela and Guiana will still be by way of Suez, and from Brazil the shortest route is by way of the Cape of Good Hope. Major Tucker, in the paper already mentioned, suggests that Jamaica may be a place from which there will be direct traffic to India, but if this were to happen the route would surely be by way either of the Suez Canal or the Cape of Good Hope; the distance from Jamaica to Bombay by the Suez route is about 5,100 miles shorter than by way of the Panama Canal. In this connexion it is noteworthy that the Republic of Panama already imports Burmese rice, which goes by way of Liver- pool or Hamburg to Colon.
?3 (4) It is believed that the opening of the canal will result in a great increase of trade in the pacific coast ports of South America, and it might be conjectured that direct trade between those ports and India will follow. For many reasons this is very unlikely to happen, but even if there were direct trade between, say, Peru or Chile and India, the best route would be from Callao and Valpa- raiso vi the Straits of Magellan and the Cape of Good Hope-for the distance from Valparaiso to Bombay by that route is nearly 4,000 miles shorter than by the trans-pacific route. Distances, of course, are not the only factors to be considered in attempting to foretell future trade routes, but in the present case the conclusions to which their study leads are supported by other considerations, and on the whole it seems clear that the spread of yellow fever to India, if such happens, will not be the result of direct trans-pacific shipping to that country from or through the endemic area in Central and Southern America. If the same line of enquiry is now applied with regard to ports further east than India, it will be found that when we get beyond Singapore the conclusions are, with one important exception, the reverse of those arrived at regarding India; in general the distances to Japan, China, Australia and the East Indies will be much shorter by the new route than by the present ones, and for this reason direct traffic to those countries through and from the endemic area may be expected. An examination of the columns of the tabular statement which refer to ports beyond Singapore will make this clear, and in addition it will be noted that by the new route Yokohama and Australia will be nearer to New York than to London. The exception is with regard to the distances between Europe and the countries named above; it will be seen that for trade between Europe and those countries the Panama Canal will not provide a shorter route than the present one by way of the Suez Canal, and this, of course, is important as indi- cating that the through traffic vi the endemic area to the East will not be so great as has sometimes been anticipated. If we judge by the factor of distance alone it is clear from the table that the through traffic to the East by the new route will be confined to traffic from the United States; and even as regards that traffic it must be noted, (a) that the Panama Canal route has to compete with the routes by way of the trans-continental railways of Canada and the United States, and the inter-oceanic railways of Mexico, Guatemala and Costa Rica, (b) that for the trade from New York to Hong Kong the Panama Canal route will have to compete with the present one vi the Suez Canal, for the gain in distance is not much more than 200 miles. Major Tucker, in his paper, suggests that the direct trade between England and Hong Kong will be greatly facilitated by the opening of the canal, but this view is not supported by the facts that the new route from London to Hong Kong will be about 4,400 miles longer than the present one vi the Suez Canal, and will even be about 1,000 miles longer than the route via the Cape of Good Hope. It is now justifiable to sum up the conclusions resulting from the above line of enquiry, by saying that " the new danger to the East" is a direct danger as far only as Hong Kong, and that the spread of yellow fever to the Straits Settle- ments and to India, by the route which we have been considering, cannot result except as a secondary event subsequent to, and consequent upon, the infection of ports in Japan, China, the East Indies or Australia. This opinion is doubt- less held by all who have studied the subject, but I do not find that stress is laid upon it in the articles that I have read; and it seems to me to be of material importance in connexion with the new danger to which India will be exposed. The problem of immediate concern, therefore, is the possible spread of yellow fever, not to India, but to the other countries just named. This problem has to do both with the conveyance of the disease from, or by way of, the Panama Canal, and with its conveyance from various Pacific coast ports which are already in communication with those countries by regular lines of steamships. The latter is the existing problem and it will be convenient to review it before considering the new problems that will arise from the construction of the Panama Canal.
?4 So far as I have been able to learn, the trans-Pacific steamship traffic of the New World is at present carried:- (1) From Vancouver by the ships of the Canadian Pacific Railway Com- pany, which maintains one service vi Yokohama and Shanghai to Hong Kong, and another vid Honolulu and the Fiji Islands to New Zealand and Australia. As Vancouver is far above the zone in which yellow fever can occur, there is no danger of the conveyance of yellow fever by those ships.  (2) From San Francisco by some eight or nine lines of steamships, the details of which are given in the section of this report dealing with Honolulu. Most of them trade as far as Honolulu only, but the ships of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company run to Japan, China and Hong Kong; and the United States army transports, and some freight steamers go to the Phillipines. San Francisco is in regular shipping communication with the coast ports down to Panama, the journey to that place taking from 26 to 30 days: but it lies at latitude 37 north of the Equator, and although the possibility that it might suffer from short outbreaks of yellow fever cannot be entirely dismissed; such an event, in view of the thorough protective measures in force, is very unlikely, and in any case it is most improbable that it would become a centre for the dissem- ination of the disease. (3) From Manzanillo and Mazatlan by the ships of the Toyo Kisen Kaisha Company and the Eng Hook Fong Company, which run vi Honolulu to Japanese and Chinese ports and Hong Kong. (4) From Salina Cruz by the ships of the American Hawaiian and the Toyo Kisen Kaisha Companies to Honolulu and to Japan and China, and by one or more lines to Tahiti and New Zealand. The Mexican ports just named are, I think, of most importance from our present point of view, for there are a number of reasons in favour of the opinion that yellow fever may become seriously prevalent in them. Salina Cruz is es- pecially important as being the Pacific terminus of the Mexican inter-Oceanic railway across the Isthmus of Tehuontepec, the connecting ports on the Atlantic being Puerto Mexico and Vera Cruz, which is the largest port in the country. The railway was opened in January 1907 and has since carried an immense amount of traffic. By this route the distance from San Francisco to New York is shorter by about 1,000 miles, and from Honolulu to New York by nearly 2,000 miles, than by the route across the Isthmus of Panama, and it has, there- fore, been said that the railway may prove a formidable rival to the Panama Canal. Already it connects on the Atlantic side with eight lines of steamships and on the Pacific side with six, and is the route used for nearly all the freight traffic between Hawaii and the Atlantic coast, the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company alone carrying every year about 300,000 tons of sugar from Honolulu to Salina Cruz en route to New York and Philadelphia. Another factor favour- ing an increase of trade in Mexican Pacific coast ports is the extension of the Southern Pacific section of the Pan-American railroad as far as Mazatlan, and it must not be forgotten, also, that those ports will be principally affected by the increased commercial activity that will follow the opening of the Panama Canal. Salina Cruz is not reported as being indigenously affected with yellow fever at present, but as recently as February 1912 seven imported cases occurred there on a ship from Guayaquil, a severely infected Ecuadorian port of which a separate account is given in Section III; and in addition it must be noted that there is much coasting trade between the port and suspected ports in Guatemala, Salvador, Nicaragua, Columbia and Peru and that during recent years the national railways of Mexico have brought it within easy reach of dangerous areas on the Gulf coast. It should be added that the Mexican Pacific coast port of San Blas is believed to be the port from which in 1826 mosquitoes were first introduced into Hawaii, and that in October 1910 a case of yellow fever was discovered at Honolulu on a ship from Manzanillo. (5) From South American Pacific coast ports as far down as Valparaiso and Coronel by the ships of the Toyo Kisen Kaisha Company. In this connexion it
?5 is important to note, however, that the ships just mentioned, after calling at Salina Cruz, enter upon a coasting voyage as far down as Coronel and return by the same route, so that for the trans-Pacific voyage, Salina Cruz is really the port of departure from the continent. The voyage from Valparaiso to Yokohama by this route takes considerably more than two months. The ships do not call at Guayaquil or at Tocopilla which are the only ports on the Pacific coast of the New World definitely reported as being indigenously affected, with yellow fever at present. I have not been able to obtain details of the sailing ship lines engaged in trans-Pacific trade, but the two charts which I append show the tracks followed by sailing ships in the Pacific Ocean, and that information is sufficient for our present purpose. The chief conclusion to be drawn from the above summary is that at present most of the traffic to the East starts from ports, such as Vancouver and San Francisco which are not now, and are not likely in the future to be, infected with yellow fever, but that there is also (and has been for some years) a moderate amount of traffic from ports, especially on. the Mexican coast, which at least must be regarded with suspicion. Turning now to the new problems that will arise when the Panama Canal is open for traffic, I may say at once that it is by no means sure that the canal will increase the risk of the spread of yellow fever to the extent that has been antici- pated. In this connexion it must be noted that the yellow fever situation on the Atlantic side of the canal and in the canal zone itself is now very different from what it was in 1903 when Sir Patrick Manson first drew attention to the dangers now under consideration. Since that time measures have been taken which have gone far to cause the disappearance of yellow fever from places which formerly were severely affected and to check ma- terially the facilities for its dissemination from places where it is still endemic. Very important facts are that Panama, Colon, Havana and other Cuban ports, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro and nearly all the West India Islands are at present free from the disease, and that as regards such ports on the Atlantic side of the canal as are likely to be engaged, in trans-Pacific trade we cannot name any that are definitely believed to be endemically affected at present. In additon, great importance must be attached to the knowledge that every possible precaution has already been taken, and will doubtless be continued, to prevent the canal from being a route by which disease may be spread. It is realised that the extensive use of the canal as a commercial highway would be greatly affected by the failure of those precautions, and it is very improbable that the United States will in the future neglect their great responsibility in regard to, them. As conditions in the canal zone stand at present, a ship proceeding, say, from New York to Honolulu, and calling only at Colon and Panama, would be as safe from the danger of being infected with yellow fever as if she had not passed through the endemic area at all. This being so it will be clear that, if the canal attracts traffic which at present crosses Central America by one of the inter- Oceanic railways and leaves from suspected ports on the Pacific coast, it may well be a safeguard rather than a danger. It may happen, for example, that the through traffic between New York and Honolulu and Japan, which at present goes by way of Puerto Mexico and Salina Cruz, will in future be carried by direct shipping through the canal and this would be a safer route. The shipping from Salina Cruz to Tahiti and New Zealand may be affected in the same way. On the other hand, of course, the increased "local" trade may add to the present distribution of yellow fever and introduce new dangers which cannot at present be foretold; and it is clear also that we cannot be entirely without apprehension regarding the possible risks from places like New Orleans and other ports in which several years' freedom from yellow fever has been followed by a cessation of vigorous anti-stegomyia measures, and that even as regards the  canal, its safety as a trade route depends upon the continuance of the present very efficient arrangements in the zone and terminal ports. This completes the summary so far as it relates to the degree of'danger at the source of yellow fever and the risk that ships will start their voyages 474DE
?6 across the Pacific in an infected condition; and it is necessary next to trace the routes of ships from the endemic area to their destinations in Asia. The details on this subject are given in Section III and only the following points need be summarized here. (1) At present all ships which leave America for the trans-Pacific voyage to the East from San Francisco and more southerly ports use the Hawaiian Islands as the first place of call. The conditions in these islands are throughout the year favourable to the existence of yellow fever, but up to the present the disease has been effectually excluded. The authorities fully appreciate the danger of the introduction of yellow fever from Mexican ports, and very thorough precautions are taken. After studying the local conditions and arrange- ments in Honolulu I am of opinion that the port affords a strong protection against the infection of Asia and the East Indies. (2) On the usual route to Hong Kong the ships, after leaving Honolulu, pass northwards into latitudes not as a rule favourable to the life of mosquitoes, and the remaining ports of call are Yokohama and other Japanese ports and Shanghai. There is a serious gap in our knowledge of the conditions in these ports, for we do not yet know whether stegomyia fasciata occurs in them or not. If it is present, and sufficiently abundant, the introduction of the yellow fever virus might lead to an epidemic, but the climate is such that the disease would entirely die out during the winter, and fresh importation would be necessary for its reappearance. (3) The climate of Hong Kong is more favourable to the existence and spread of yellow fever, but again we are ignorant of the presence or absence of stegomyia fasciata there. In all probability a thorough search during the hot months would show that it is present, but quite possibly it is not very abundant. (4) The route from San Francisco vi Honolulu to the Phillipines does not necessarily take ships northward to Japan, but until San Francisco or Honolulu becomes infected such a route is not a cause for anxiety. On the whole we must conclude that the present routes are not very favour- able to the infection of Asia, and it only remains to endeavour to foretell whether future routes will be more so. On this subject Major Tucker has suggested that ships from the Panama Canal may follow a more southerly route, calling perhaps at Christmas Island instead of at Honolulu, and being, during the whole voyage, in a climate favourable to mosquito life. Such a change of route would not, however, be adopted unless it materially shortened the journey, which is fortunately not the case. In this connexion it is important that ships crossing the Pacific usually follow as far as possible what are called the Great Circle sailing tracks, which are considerably shorter than the Mercatorial tracks, and that those tracks often take them into latitudes much higher than those of the ports between which the ships sail. For example, the shortest route between Panama (latitude 9 N.) and Manila (latitude 14 N.) is a great circle track which passes for about 1,000 miles of the journey above the 40th degree of north latitude; and the shortest between Panama and Hong Kong (latitude 22 N.) is a track which passes for about 800 miles of the journey above the 44th degree of north latitude and afterwards touches Yokohama. The distance between Panana and Hong Kong by that route is about 330 miles shorter than by a route which on a chart on the Mercator Projection would be represented by a straight line between the two ports. It will be apparent, therefore, that ships from the Panama Canal will, in all probability, go northward to Yokohama not only on account of the trade with Japan but because such a course is the shortest that can be followed; and it will be clear that the fact that vessels follow those tracks materially lessens the risk of the conveyance of mosquitoes across the Pacific. The climate of the present route from Salina Cruz to Tahiti for New Zealand and Australia is, of course, favourable to mosquitoes, but I have. already men- tioned the possibility that the canal may attract the traffic which now departs to those countries from that port; if this happens it will, in my view, lessen the present risk that the ships may start their voyage with infected mosquitoes on board.
7 II. RECOMMENDATIONS. Although the facts and considerations summarized in the foregoing section must, I think, lead to a modification of the opinions hitherto held regarding the degree of danger of the spread of yellow fever to the East and to India as a result of the opening of the Panama Canal, it cannot be too strongly urged that they do not justify the conclusion that little or no action is at present necessary. (1) In the first place it must be emphasised both that the knowledge obtain- able for the purpose of forecasting the situation that will arise after the canal is opened for traffic is unavoidably incomplete and imperfect, and that at any time after the opening of the canal there may occur unexpected events which would alter the whole position. From the circumstances of the case the knowledge that can be obtained at present is insufficient to enable us to do more than conjecture what changes in the distribution of yellow fever in the endemic area, what increased traffic to the East, and what measures to prevent ships from carrying infection, will follow the opening of the canal. And although it has been shewn in Section I that, in all probability, India will not be in danger until some of the countries further East become infected, it seems to me essential that she should be supplied with continuous information upon those subjects. It is, of course, even more urgent that such information should be available to our Far Eastern colonial ports, which, as I have shewn, are more directly exposed to the risk of infection. For these reasons my first recommendation is that permanent arrangements should be made to obtain continuous first-hand information regarding the yellow fever situation in the endemic area, the actual shipping traffic in that area, the actual shipping traffic from and through the area to the East, and the measures that are taken to prevent ships from carrying infection. So far as I can learn, the only satisfactory method of obtaining this information is to station permanently in the endemic area a medical officer who will be constantly in touch with the Consular and quarantine officers of the United States and other countries. I therefore strongly advocate the appointment of such an officer. In practice he would be attached for duty to the British Consulate at Panama, and his work would chiefly be that of an intelligence officer in the endemic area. By acting in co-operation with the Consular and sanitary officers of the United States, by visiting suspicious places, and by making a special study of the local and trans-Pacific shipping, he would quickly become aware of any new circumstances which threatened the safety of the East. He would, of course, keep a continuous record of the shipping from the endemic area to the East, and would ascertain the risk of infection to those ships. He might, as a rule, report his transactions monthly, but he would also be empowered to cable at any time to the quarantine officers in Eastern ports such information as would enable them to take adequate precautions against any threatened danger. Supplementary to that measure it is highly advisable, I think, to appoint a second medical officer as an intelligence officer in an area of which Hong Kong would be the centre. He would be stationed in Hong Kong and one of his first duties would be to become thoroughly familiar with the shipping which enters that port from the endemic area, and with the history of the voyages of such ships; but he would also place himself in frequent written communication with the sanitary authorities of the Phillipines, and, if necessary, would visit Manila in order to ascertain exactly what new or increased dangers may have arisen to the those islands as a result of the opening of the Panama Canal, and what steps are taken for their protection. In the same way he would endeavour to watch the situation in its relation to Shanghai. In Hong Kong itself he would associate himself with, and assist in, any measures that may be taken for the better protection of the port and for the safety of ships which leave the port, for Singapore and India; and, by his reports to the central organisation presently to be mentioned, India would be constantly informed ot any new circumstances of a threatening character in regard to the spread of yellow fever, as well as of the progress of any enquiries such as that relating to the presence or absence of stegomyia fasciata. Following this plan further, it would doubtless be of great advantage, though it is not perhaps essential, to appoint a third intelligence officer with
?8 headquarters at Singapore, and with permission to visit the chief ports in Sumatra, Java and Borneo, for purposes similar to those already mentioned. The scheme here advocated is not a new one, for the United States, with a view to ensure the safety of their ports, has for some years extensively employed the practice of attaching officers of the Public Health Service to the American Consulates in foreign ports; and it has been found to be by far the most satis- factory method of obtaining trust worthy and complete information, and of exercising control over ships bound for the United States from those ports. I believe that, if somewhat similar action on the part of Great Britain were to be taken in the manner that I have suggested, the countries concerned would welcome the co-operation of the officers appointed, and that its adoption would be a reasonable and effectual safeguard to the East and to India, (2) In the second place it must be recognised that, as is shown in other sections of this report we have very little or no knowledge, not only upon the subject of a sure method of diagnosing yellow fever, but upon such subjects as the presence or absence and distribution of stegomyia fasciata in eastern colonial and other ports, the problem of whether the very widely distributed and abundant species, stegomyia scutellaris, carries the disease or not, the bionomics of those species, and many other matters of prime importance in connection with etiology and prevention; and that should occasion arise to deal with an irruption of yellow fever in a new territory, this want of knowledge would greatly hamper and delay efficient and enlightened action on the part of the authorities concerned. Therefore my second recommendation is that the study of the subjects named, and of other subjects of which a complete knowledge is essential to a successful combat against the disease, be adequately taken up. Turning now for a moment to consider how these two recommendations can best be carried out, it is clear that India is not not alone concerned in the matter, and that by herself she cannot undertake such extensive and prolonged enquiries as they may necessitate. The subject is of the greatest impor- tance to the British colonies in the East, but it affects British possessions generally, and I think there can be no doubt that the most satisfactory results would be obtained by dealing with it as a matter that is of common interest to the British Empire as a whole. From this point of view it is a national task best carried out under the authority of the Home Government, by combined co-ordinated action in various parts of the Empire, the assistance of India and the colonies being given as may be necessary. I need not emphasise the great value of a central co-ordinating organization in work of this kind, but I may remark that during my tour I gained the impression that in some colonies local action is inadequate, and that, owing to the absence of a correlating organi- sation, the useful effect of correct and complete information in one area would possibly be frustrated by lack of knowledge and action in others. The first recommendation made above implies the necessity not only of appointing " intelligence officers " to whom adequate co-operation on the part of the several authorities in the foreign and colonial ports must be assured, but of establishing a central Intelligence Bureau for the compilation and distribution of the informa- tion collected; and the Home Government are in the best position to arrange for such requirements. Again as regards the second recommendation, although some of the problems will doubtless be solved in the near future by individual action on the part of the colonies and of India, there are others about which it must be said that little or no advance can be expected except from continuous and sustained research organised and carried out on a much larger scale than has within recent years been attempted; and it is clearly very desirable that as to the means by which such enquiries can best be carried out, and as to their scope and objects, the advice of the Royal Society in England should be sought, and that the enquiries should, if possible, be conducted under the control of that Society. The Home Government are in the best position to secure the co-opera- tion of the Society in this matter. (3) If the above recommendations are accepted, India should, I think, take a prominent part in the initiation of the joint action by representing the matter
?9 to the Home Government, and by offering to give financial or other assistance towards the appointment of the intelligence officers, the establishment of the central Intelligence Bureau, and the institution of any scientific enquiry which may be carried out under the auspices of the Royal Society. Although the evidence at present available indicates that India is not in immediate danger, the continuous receipt of first-hand information on the subjects already mentioned, is, I think, of such importance that if the Home Government, acting through the colonies, are not able to arrange for the appointment of intelligence officers, India will be compelled to ensure her safety by appointing such officers from her own medical service. Secondly, it is very necessary, I think, that India should proceed uninterrup- tedly with the systematic investigation of the stegomyia problem according to a definite scheme, as well as with the continuous improvement and house to house extension of public constant water supplies, combined with the abolition of cisterns and other water-storage receptacles, and, in general with the continuous carrying out of such measures as are of permanent value in reducing the breeding places of stegomyia mosquitoes. Thirdly, one other problem calling for enquiry on the part of India must be mentioned, namely, the problem of the possible spread of yellow fever by way of the Cape of Good Hope. So far as I am aware, attention has not hitherto been drawn to this subject, but any one who studies a mercantile marine chart of the South Atlantic Ocean will see that the problem of the spread of yellow fever across it, either directly or by way of the islands of Ascension and St. Helena, is very similar to the problem of its spread across the Pacific, either directly or by way of the Hawaiian and Fiji islands. Rio de Janeiro is nearly 1,500 miles nearer to the Cape than Panama is to Honolulu and the Cape is 500 miles nearer to Colombo than Honolulu is to Hong Kong. In Capetown, which is at latitude 33S., as in Yokohama, which is at latitude 35N., there is, I understand, no record of the presence or absence of stegomyia fasciata. (4) Finally I recommend a reform which I think should be carried out inde- pendently of the scheme outlined above, as being urgently necessary both for general reasons and for the special reason of the possible introduction of yellow fever. I refer to the advisability of strengthening the line of sanitary defence for our Eastern colonies and for India especially in Hong Kong. I have recorded in Section III my opinion regarding the present arrangements for the inspection and control of ships and for quarantine in that port. It is not at present clear what satisfactory steps could be taken if a ship infected with yellow fever were to arrive at the port, and it is greatly to be hoped that a modern quarantine station adequate to the needs of a shipping centre of such importance, and with a resident staff whose sole duty is to protect the port from the entry of infectious diseases will be established without delay. The Port Health rules regarding yellow fever might also with advantage be brought into line with modern know- ledge, and arrangements made for the destruction of mosquitoes on ships. III. This section contains a general description of the conditions in most of the ports that I visited. In order that the account may be as short as possible, only such conditions as are of importance in connexion with yellow fever are dealt with in it. The 1sthmus of Panama, which is in the centre of the endemic area of yellow fever in the New World, runs in a general direction from east to west on or about the 9th degree of north latitude, and the Panama Canal, when completed, will cross it in a direction approximately from north to south in the position shown on the following map. The town of Colon, with its port Cristobal, is at the northerly or Atlantic entrance to the canal, and the town of Panama (which is considerably east of Colon) with its port Balboa, is at the southerly or Pacific entrance. The territory within five miles of each side of the centre line of the canal, together with the coast lines of the area and the islands in Panama Bay is called the "Panama Canal zone" which, by a treaty 474DE
?10 ratified in February 1904, was ceded to the United States in perpetuity. Part of the district traversed by the canal is low and swampy, part is hilly, and within it are the main streams and tributaries of two large rivers, the Chagres and the Rio Grande. Following the route from the Atlantic to the Pacific coasts the canal first passes through tropical jungle on a low swampy alluvial plain to the Gatun locks and dam, which, by impounding the waters of the Chagres and its tributaries, will form in the valley of the river an artificial lake 24 miles long and with an area of about 164 square miles, extending to the series of nearly continuous hills through which the Culebra cut has been dug. At the end of this section the canal will enter a second smaller lake formed between the locks at Pedro Miguel and Miraflores by impounding the waters of the Rio Grande, and afterwards it will pass down the valley of that river to Panama. The Panama Inter-Oceanic Railroad, along which are a number of large and small villages, follows, in general, the same route. Including employees of the Canal Commission the population of the area over which the United States has sanitary control is estimated to be nearly 155,000 of whom about 46,000 are in. Panama and nearly 20,000 in Colon. Climatic conditions on the Isthmus in this region are represented by an average temperature which throughout the year varies less than 3 from the annual average of nearly 80F, and by an annual rainfall which is about 140 inches on the Atlantic coast, about 93 inches in the interior, and about 60 inches near the shores of the Pacific. As regards rainfall, however, there is a sharp division into dry and rainy seasons, the dry season beginning in December and lasting until about the middle of April. The rains of the wet season are some- times "torrential" and widespread flooding occurs. These and other condi- tions such as the arrangements for collecting and storing water during the dry season, the frequent importation of large numbers of non-immunes, and the trade communications with other ports in the endemic area, have been favour- able to the presence of yellow fever; and although such statistics as are available indicate that the terminal cities were sometimes free from reported cases for several successive years, it is believed with good reason that the disease was constantly present in an endemic form, and that the introduction of a sufficient number of non-immunes would, in any year, have resulted in an epidemic. This, at any rate, was the belief in which the sanitary authorities of the United States commenced, in the spring of 1904, to take measures for protecting the labour force from yellow fever. The problem was concerned almost entirely with the eradication of the disease from the cities of Panama and Colon, and with preventing its reintroduction into them; and the measures taken included, in addition to a great campaign for the detection and isolation of people suspected to be suffering from yellow fever and the thorough fumiga- tion of every house with the object of destroying infected mosquitoes, such measures as the establishment of complete health departments for the towns and of quarantine arrangements for the ports, the preparation and construction of water-supply and sewage systems, the construction, paving and draining of streets, the demolition and rebuilding of insanitary houses, the reclaiming of large tide-washed areas and water-logged swamps, the abolition or effective covering of every water-receptacle in the towns, and the screening of houses. In the early days of these admirable sanitary works the difficulties were great. Much local prejudice had to be overcome and there was considerable delay in obtaining necessary materials. The construction of the water-supply system for Panama was sanctioned in August 1904, but owing to the non-arrival of the iron water mains the work could not be completed until July 1905. Sewers were not laid until the fall of 1905 and street paving not until the end of that year. Mr. W. F. Johnson's book entitled "Four centuries of the Panama Canal" contains the following passages regarding this matter: "Re- quisitions for supplies, even for things urgently needed in the hospitals and by the sanitary squad, in cases where every hour was precious, had to be sent to Washington, deliberated upon by the Commissioners, and then, if approved, advertised, awarded, and finally filled weeks and months after date. It took many weeks to get mosquito-netting for the windows of the Canal office building and then not enough was supplied. The chief sanitary officer wanted netting for all the official buildings in the Canal zone. This request was refused as
?11 extravagant and unnecessary. Then he asked for at least enough to enclose the verandahs of the hospitals. This, too, was refused, and he was told that there was no need of enclosing more than half the verandahs, and that even then a part of the space should be solidly boarded up instead of screened." In the meantime, however, yellow fever broke out among the Canal employees and, according to Colonel Gorgas, "the force on the Isthmus was much demoralised thereby. It was difficult to get men to come down, and when they did come they were generally panic stricken and left us. This fear affected all ranks of employees from the highest to the lowest, and while there were hundreds of exceptions and plenty of plucky men who were not affected by the prevailing panic, we could readily see that if the conditions as they existed in 1905 were to continue, the canal would never be finished." There is no doubt that this outbreak was a chief factor in procuring for the sanitary authorities such facilities as afterwards enabled them, uninterruptedly and almost without regard to expense, to bring the Canal zone into a sanitary condition which has certainly not been equalled in any other area of similar size in the tropics. In General Abbot's book entitled "Problems of the Panama Canal," it is stated that the yellow fever panic on the Isthmus reached its height in June 1905, but prior to that date an order by the President of the United States had announced that "the practical result of the operations of the Isthmian Canal Commission appointed and acting under previous executive orders has not been satisfactory, and requires a change in the personnel of the Commission and in the instructions for its guidance." The new arrangements promulgated in that order came into force early in the summer of 1905, and since that time sanitation on the Canal zone has proceeded steadily and swiftly towards completeness. In attempting to give an idea of present conditions it is necessary to deal separately with the commission towns of Ancon and Cristobal and the native cities of Panama and Colon. Complete freedom from yellow fever and almost complete freedom from stegomyia mosquitoes is the outstanding character of the present condition of Ancon and Cristobal, and it appeared to me very improbable that, if present arrangements are maintained, these towns would ever again be infected with yellow fever. In the first place they are quite separate from the native cities-they are examples of the adoption of the principle of segregation of the non-immune. In the second, although all the dwelling houses and most of the public buildings are built of wood, these centres of population are in every necessary respect "model towns." The arrangements for sanitary control, and the systems of sewerage, water-supply, drainage, lighting, street paving and general cleanliness are exceedingly thorough, and every house is screened with wire gauze in such a manner that mosquitoes are effectually excluded from the verandahs and the whole interior of the house. In the third place the inhabitants consist entirely of Commission employees who are not only under strict control, but voluntarily co-operate and assist in all measures for the elimination of mosquitoes-of which, it may be added, they are in wholesome dread. The result is that in these towns stegomyia mosquitoes are almost non-existent. We cannot say, however, that they have been entirely eradicated, because on April 7th, 1912, (which was near the end of a period of five months almost unpreced- entedly dry weather) I was able to catch several adult stegomyia fasciata in my bedroom in the Tivoli Hotel in Ancon; but there can be no doubt that they have been reduced to such a degree that, even if undiscovered cases of yellow fever were introduced, the disease would not spread; and on the whole I conclude that these towns are uninfectible. The cities of Panama and Colon still remain under the Republic of Panama, but the authorities of the United States have jurisdiction in all that relates to health conditions, and the standard of sanitation which they have set themselves to attain is much higher than that aimed at in any other tropical town with which I am acquainted-and very much higher, of course, than in many non-tropical towns of the same size in Europe or America. The original state of both cities was exceedingly bad. Dr. Lacroisade, who for many years was medical director of the French Company's hospital near Panama, described the roads in Colon as being "veritable sewers" and in Panama as being "in a repulsive condition of
?12 filth.  Most of the houses were dilapidated wooden structures erected on piles over swampy areas and roadside ditches which, being clogged with rubbish and house refuse of all kinds, formed a succession of stagnant pools. There were no systems of sewerage or water-supply, and as it was necessary for the inhabitants to store water for use in the dry season, every house had its cistern and every yard contained a large supply of water collecting tubs and tins which were the source of enormous swarms of mosquitoes. The sanitary works carried on conti- nuously since 1904, and still in active progress, have effected a remarkable change in these conditions. Regulations now permit the condemnation and demolition of insanitary buildings, they prohibit the erection of any building which cannot be connected with the water-supply and sewage systems, and require that the whole ground on which a house and its yard are built must be concreted, that the house must be connected with the water-supply and sewage system, must have water-closets, shower baths and sinks in the proportion of one complete set for every 15 people, and must have no outside roof gutters and no cistern or other receptacle for the storage of water. The alley-ways between houses must be concreted and must slope towards the centre of the alley and towards the street paving and drains. These rules and those regarding the paving of the streets and macadamising of the roads will bring about the result that within the area built over there is no space that is not concreted or in some other manner made hard and smooth so that water cannot lodge. The radical sanitary works just outlined do not as yet extend throughout the whole areas of the cities, and on the outskirts the conditions are very different from those in the main sections. Much of the site on which Colon is built was originally below the level of the sea, and, although the town proper is now on land which by extensive filling operations has been raised from three to eight feet above sea level, it is almost surrounded by low-lying marshes and swamps which cannot be effectively drained; and on some of these areas there are hamlets in the old style. In Panama city, also, the conditions on the outskirts are reminis- cent of the original state of affairs and a number of houses remain to be sanitated and to be connected with the sewerage system. Roof gutters and other potential breeding places of stegomyia mosquitoes are also to be found, and the great amount of building that is going on, as well as the extension of the existing water-supply and sewerage systems, produce conditions requiring constant inspec- tion and control. An idea of the nature and amount of this kind of work as well as of other sanitary effort will be gained from the following statement which refers to 1910-the last year for which the information is available to me :- CITY OF PANAMA.

At the same time it must be remembered that it is still possible to collect stegomyia larvae even in the dry season, and for this reason it is the case that the continuance of the satisfactory condition above recorded is dependent en- tirely on a continuance of the present very efficient arrangements for regular inspection and destruction of breeding places. Every year, however, the task is becoming easier by reason of the extension of the areas in which the sanitary conditions are such as almost entirely to eliminate the possibility of the existence of breeding places suitable for the stegomyia mosquito. The prevalence of other kinds of mosquitoes than stegomyia is not a matter with which the present report is concerned. Finally it may be noted that the demolition of many dilapidated houses and huts in which the poorer inhabitants used to live has brought about, especially in Colon, a great decrease in the number of dwellings suitable for those classes. The deficiency is being corrected to some extent by erecting approved tenement houses of which each room is rented separately ; but as the rent charged for a single room in these houses is not less than eight dollars gold per month (about 24 rupees) the measure does not prevent the almost complete exclusion of poor people from the cities. The arrival of such people is also prevented by the immigration laws, which not only prohibit the admission into the country of per- sons of Chinese, Turkish and Syrian descent, but require that everyone admitted must have in his possession at least 15 dollars and must be prepared to pay in addition 3 dollars 20 cents for quarantine charges. It is obvious, of course, that measures which result in excluding all except well-to-do people from the popula- tion of a town have a great effect in improving its health statistics and in enabling it to be kept in a sanitary condition. In this connection it is not out of place to remark that the measure above mentioned is one among many which make it difficult to cite the cities now under consideration as examples of what can and should be done in other tropical towns.

Quarantine arrangements.-The regulations of maritime quarantine for the ports of Colon and Panama are given in an appendix, and here it is   necessary to note only a few details of interest and importance. The scheme by which the United States seeks to prevent   the   introduction of  yellow  fever   into   its  ports   includes   arrangements not   only   at   the  local ports of arrival of  ships, but  at   the   distant   infected or   suspected   ports from which the ships have come.    The latter part of the   scheme   has   been   rendered possible by international  agreement,   and   is a most   important   link in the chain of defence.    In its complete form it necessitates   the   placing of a United States medical officer in each port that is suspected to   be   dangerous.    He is attached to the United States Consulate   of  the   port,   and   some   of  his   duties   are, to furnish trustworthy information concerning the sanitary and   health   conditions of the port and district, to telegraph  information of the   outbreak   and   progress of quarantinable diseases, to examine all passengers  and   crew   of  vessels   leaving the port for ports belonging to the United  States,   to  supply   health   certificates and certificates of immunity and of vaccination to certain   passengers, to inspect all ships prior to their departure and if necessary to   fumigate  them  before   they leave, to issue in co-operation   with   the   American   Consul,   Bills   of   Health to ships, and generally   to   endeavour   to   ensure   that no   ship or passenger   shall proceed from the port in a condition   liable   to  carry   infection   to  an   American port.    The reports  of   these   officers   are   of  great   value   in   deciding  whether quarantine shall be established against a port and what measures shall   be   taken with regard to the ships and passengers   arriving   from it ; and the   action  and supervision exercised by those   officers   sometimes   enables   trade   with   infected ports to be carried on without the delays   to   shipping  that   would be  necessary in the ordinary course.    This is illustrated in the following account   of  the   pro- cedure adopted in connection with the ship on   which I returned to  Panama from Guayaquil, which is a yellow  fever   and   plague-infected   port  3 days journey from the Canal zone.    The vessel in which I travelled  trades directly to and fro between those ports and it  complies   with   the   following   rules:  (1) it   carries a doctor, (2)   it   is   fitted   with a Clayton   fumigating   apparatus, (3) it   does   not proceed to the wharves at Guayaquil but anchors in   mid-stream about two miles down the river at a place where there is no  risk   that   infected   stegomyia  mos- quitoes will fly on board, (4) no  member of the ship's crew   is  allowed  to go on shore at Guayaquil. The passengers who intended proceeding from Guayaquil on the ship were required, before going on board, to visit the medical officer of the United States Marine Hospital Service who is stationed at Guayaquil. It is his duty to ensure
?17 as far as possible that no passenger proceeds on board who is suffering, or is likely during the journey to suffer from, fever suspicious of yellow fever, plague or other infectious disease. To every passenger "passed" by him a certifi- cate to that effect was given. For purposes of plague prevention the baggage of passengers was disinfected before being taken on board. On the day of departure the ship was visited by the United States medical officer and the sanitary staff of the port, and after the captain had certified that none of the officers or crew had been on shore at Guayaquil the passengers, officers and crew were carefully examined. The holds of the ship and the cook's galley and pantries and the quarters of the crew were then sealed and fumigated, the Clayton apparatus with which the ship was fitted being used for the holds, and sulphur pots for the galley and pantries. The Bill of Health which had been made out and signed by the Consul was then completed and endorsed by the United States medical officer, and the ship was free to proceed. We arrived off Panama on the evening of the fourth day after leaving Guayaquil and anchored in the appointed station off quarantine island. Soon after daylight the ship was visited by the quarantine officers, who obtained from the captain the Bill of Health and ascertained that there had been no case of suspicious illness dur- ing the voyage. The whole ship's company was then paraded and examined thoroughly, the temperature of each person being taken. The same procedure was then carried out with regard to the passengers, their certificates being collected and the temperature of each person being taken. The passengers were then taken off the ship and placed in quarantine to complete a period of seven days* from the day of going on board at Guayaquil, but the ship and the ship's company (none of whom had gone on shore at Guayaquil) were granted pratique and allowed to proceed to the wharves at Panama. I was informed that if a case of yellow fever had occurred during the voyage the quarantine officers would have ascertained where it had been contracted: if it had been contracted on shore at Guayaquil the patient would have been isolated in the quarantine station, the ship would have been thoroughly fumiga- ted to destroy any mosquitoes that might possibly be on board, and then would have been allowed to proceed with its officers and crew as though it had arrived with a clean record; if the case had been contracted on the ship a thorough fumigation would be carried out and then the ship and its entire personnel would have been detained in quarantine for 6 days subsequent to the fumigation. The staff for the quarantine arrangements at Colon, Panama and Bocas del Toro consisted at the time of my visit of a chief quarantine officer, three quarantine officers, an assistant quarantine officer and 35 employees. The duty of examining immigrants is also carried out by these officers. At Panama the quarantine station is on one of the islands in the Bay; at Colon it is at some distance from the city. In both stations there are separate buildings for patients suffering from different infectious diseases and all buildings are very thoroughly screened. Mosquitoes are absent from the island on which the quarantine station for Panama is built. The following figures relate to the quarantine transactions at the ports of Ancon-Panama and Colon-Cristobal during 1910:- Number of vessels inspected and passed................................................ Number of vessels fumigated ...................................................... Number of Bills of Health vised or issued........................................ Number of crew and passengers inspected........................................... Number of persons held in quarantine at the detention houses to complete the incubation period of yellow fever and plague............................. Number held on board vessels for the same purpose............................ Number of immigrants rejected ....................................................... * If only yellow fever had been in question the period would have been 6 days; but Guayaquil was also infected with plague.  Instances of this kind occasionally happen. The procedure is based on the view that the ship lef\ill\ Guaya- quil without any infected mosquitoes on board, but that possibly there might be some previously uninfected mos- quitoes on board. The crew are allowed to proceed because the previously uninfected mosquitoes even if they had bitten the yellow fever patient during the voyage, would not be infective until 12 days had elapsed, and the journey to Panama (where they would be killed by fumigation) takes only 4 days. 474DE
?18 New Orleans.-The accompanying map of the chief shipping routes in the Gulf of Mexico and the Carribean Sea indicates the present importance of New Orleans in connexion with the spread of yellow fever, an importance which will doubtless be increased when the markets of the western coast of South America are brought into direct shipping communication with those of Louisiana and neighbouring States by way of the Panama Canal. The city is exposed to infec- tion from both the seaward and landward sides, and as regards the latter danger it is believed by responsible local officials that the chain of defence is unavoidably weak. Railway communication between the city and Central America is advanc- ing rapidly, and even at present passengers from suspected places in Mexico can arrive in New Orleans within the incubation period of yellow fever. The city lies on the 30th degree of north latitude and its climate is such that yellow fever can be epidemic during only the hotter months of the year; the average monthly temperature in winter and spring does not rise above 55 and much lower tempe- ratures than that are often recorded. This fortunate circumstance was in the past the only check upon the severe epidemics of yellow fever from which during the first half of the 19th century the city suffered every year. The beginning of a reduction in the frequency of those epidemics dates from 1859, and must be attributed during the early years to the absence of participation in foreign com- merce as a result of the great civil war, and later to the gradual substitution of a rigid system of maritime quarantine and of a strict observance of the quarantine laws for the quite ineffective and almost entirely unobserved systems of earlier years. But the evolution of an effective quarantine system was of slow growth, and it was not until the early eighties that comparatively adequate arrangements were established. These arrangements, in addition to ensuring almost complete freedom from the risk of entry of yellow fever patients, included rules for the fumigation of ships by sulphur, and although the difficulties of carrying out the latter measure in the case of fruit vessels subsequently necessitated modifications which may have permitted the entry of infected mosquitoes, their general efficacy is shown by the following figures. Since 1900 the only year in which a death from yellow fever has been recorded was 1905, when an epidemic which is said to have caused 3,403 cases and 437 deaths occurred. That epidemic afforded the first opportunity in a large American city of carrying out measures based upon the knowledge that the disease is spread by stegomyia mosquitoes, and in consequence has been much written about. Its present interest is chiefly that it brought to light the exceedingly primitive and dangerous condition of the city, and provided a much needed stimulus to sanitary effort and progress. Since its occurrence improvement has been more or less continuous, but the problem is very complex, and at the time of my visit in April 1912 it appeared to me that its difficulties had been by no means entirely overcome. The accompanying map which shows the general arrangement and boun- daries of the city, and the position of districts occupied chiefly by tenement houses, conveys some idea of the magnitude of the task with which the sanitary authorities have to deal. The municipality as a whole covers an area of 196 square miles, of which the "city proper," containing about 80,000 houses, covers 36 square miles. In general the site has been reclaimed from swamps and flooded areas which were three or four feet below the level of the lakes and river by which the city is almost surrounded; and on the outskirts of what is called the "built up section" or "improved area" of the city, swamps, marshes, canals and low jungle are still the chief features of the landscape. The popula- tion of the city proper is estimated to be about 380,000, of whom perhaps 100,000 are negroes. The remainder includes large numbers of French, Spaniards and Italians, and it has been said of the Italians, as well as of the negro inhabitants that they do not participate in the civic life of the community, but live in a manner which violates every sanitary rule. Among a population of this kind conditions are favourable for the concealment of disease, and any inter- ference for sanitary purposes is usually much resented. The 1905 epidemic of yellow fever began near the wharves in the tenement districts where these people live, and for the reasons just given it is not surprising that it progressed for some time before its presence became known to the authorities, and that during its continuance it was necessary to seek the assistance of Italian physicians,
?19 interpreters, Catholic priests, and missionary sisters in the work of investigation of cases. At the present time the sanitary affairs of the city are carried out by the following departments:- (1) A department of Public Works, charged with the cleaning of the streets and the removal and disposal of garbage. The latter is collected in carts and loaded into garbage boats by which it is dumped into the Mississippi river below the city limits. (2) A Sewerage and Water Board charged with providing: - (i) A system of public sewers for the removal of night soil and domestic waste water. Work on this system, which comprises 375 miles of sewers and pipes, was begun in 1903, and is now almost complete, the old cesspools and vaults being abolished as house connections are made. The night soil from houses not con- nected with the public sewers is collected in barrels at the cost of the householder, and conveyed below the city limits by special "nuisance boats" and dumped in the Mississippi river in mid-stream. (ii) An adequate system of drainage for the removal of storm water. For this very difficult problem there are seven drainage pumps, the water being carried off in canals and pipes. (iii) A filtered water-supply for the 80,000 houses in the city proper. This work was not begun until 1905, but is now said to be as complete as is possible in a growing city. An important result of the system will be the abolition of the large house cisterns which are such favourable breeding places for stegomyia mosquitoes; but at the time of my visit this necessary reform had been only partially accomplished. The water-supply is obtained from the Mississippi river and is filtered by mechanical precipitation and other means. (3) A Municipal Board of Health created in 1898 with power "to estab- lish, control and administer all matters of strictly and purely local sanitation," but for carrying out executive action it is dependent in great measure upon the various departments of the city govern- ment. It is organised in three departments, namely, sanitary, food inspection and vital statistics. Anti-mosquito work is one of the duties of the sanitary department and was commenced in earnest during the yellow fever epidemic of 1905. Unfortunately during the last few years, owing to the exhaustion of the special fund which enabled a separate anti-mosquito staff to be maintained at an annual cost of 50,000 dollars, it has not been possible to carry on the work with the same thoroughness as was the case between 1905 and 1908. In the Biennial report for 1908-09 it is said that in 1909 the work was done by the city police, but that "as divided authority in sanitary matters is never desirable" the city had provided for the resumption of the work in 1910 "by a special force selected by the Board of Health and exclusively responsible to its executive officers for correct performance of duty." I have no knowledge of the plan adopted in 1911 and as regards 1912 I was informed that owing to lack of funds no campaign against mosquitoes was being carried on. During the time of my visit the temperature was not higher than between 42 and 50 F. and I saw no mosquitoes of any kind, but the President of the Louisiana State Board of Health, the British Consul General, and other officials informed me that during the summer months they are exceedingly prevalent and troublesome. The common species were said to be anopheles maculipennis, stegomyia fasciata and various calicines. The prevalence of stegomyia fasciata must, of course, have been greatly reduced by
?20 the work of abolishing and screening cisterns which followed the introduction of the water-supply, but at the time of my visit many favourable breeding places for the species still remained, and one cannot but regard with anxiety the cessation of the special mea- sures. As a rule the houses in the better parts of the city are carefully screened, but this is not the rule in the areas where an epidemic is most likely to occur, and at the hotel where I stayed the manner of screening was not such as would have prevented the entry of mosquitoes. Quarantine arrangements are supervised by the Federal Government and the rules forthe treatment of ships are, in general, similar to those adopted in the Canal zone, but all ships from suspected ports are fumigated throughout before being permitted to proceed up the river, and in the case of infected ships the period of detention after fumigation is seven days instead of six. The quaran- tine station at which all ships proceeding to New Orleans must stop is situated at the mouth of the Mississippi, 90 miles below the port. The following sketch indicates the arrangement and uses of the different buildings. The station is on an uninhabited area of land, and is free from mosquitoes, but for greater safety all the buildings are thoroughly screened. The station is provided with a disinfecting apparatus on a tug as well as with the movable apparatus on shore. Guayaquil.-Yellow fever has been endemic in some of the seaports of Ecuador for many years and the danger of its spread from that country is a cons- tant source of anxiety to the officials of the Panama Canal zone. Heavy expenses incurred during the political troubles in which the country is frequently involved have strained its financial resources, and adequate sanitary public works are almost non-existent. The available records of the occurrence of yellow fever refer only to Guayaquil (which is the principal seaport) and neighbouring places along the railway, and they are not, I think, sufficiently accurate to be given in detail. They shew, however, that the disease has been endemic for a long time and that, while cases occur as a rule in every month of the year, the disease is most preva- lent during the rainy months from December to April. Any unusual immigration of non-immunes at once causes a rise in the number of cases, and in Guayaquil this occurred markedly in December 1911 and January 1912 when revolutionary troubles brought many non-immune soldiers into the district. The troubles were such that no record was kept during that period, but during February there were recorded 98 new cases and 43 deaths and during March 96 new cases and 36 deaths. Cases and deaths were also recorded in those months at Duran, Tagu- achi, Milagro, Naranjito, Huigra and Naranjal. The distribution of the disease in Guayaquil during the last three years is shown on the accompanying map. The city is situated on low-lying land bet- ween the river Guayas and an arm of the sea or salt water creek known as the Estero Salado, and considerable areas in its neighbourhood are covered with brackish water. The climate is equable, the daily average temperature being about 76 F. with a range between 72 in the morning, 80 at mid-day and 79 in the evening. In 1910 the highest monthly temperatures were in February and March when the average figures 'were 72 in the morning, 84 at mid-day and 81 in the evening. As a rule no rain falls from the beginning of May until the end of November, but the remaining months are very wet. The population- numbers about 80,000, and is housed for the most part in water-logged situations among ponds, marches, stagnant water-courses and open ditches. The houses of the poorer classes are usually constructed of split bamboos and are raised on piles. A few main streets near the water-front are laid with large smooth stones, but in many places the stones have become loose and worn away so that large pools and ruts full of water are numerous: the remaining roads, being entirely " unmade," are grass grown and deep with mud; and down the middle of them there are surface ditches full of stagnant water. A portion of the city is provided with a water-supply and sewerage system, but the water is turned on for only a few hours each day, and during that time the inhabitants collect as much as they can in cisterns, barrels, large water-jars and other receptacles.
?21 At the time of my visit in April, mosquitoes were exceedingly prevalent, cellia albimana and stegomyia fasciata being particularly abundant. The hotel at which I stayed was partially screened, but on the first day I caught ten specimens of stegomyia fasciata in my bedroom and many specimens every day afterwards. I also caught adults of this species in the offices of the British and American Consulates and in shops and houses of private citizens. They were also present in the wards of the yellow fever lazaretto although it is situated on the outskirts of the town and is well screened. Through the kindness of Senor Dr. Cornejo Gomez, Director of the Sani- tary Service at Guayaquil, I had an opportunity, in company with Senor Dr. Mino, Senor Dr. Pareja and others, of studying the sanitary organisation at work in the city and the measures that are being taken in the attempt to eradicate plague and yellow fever. These measures are fully described in the official publication which accompanies this report and it is not necessary for me to recapitulate them here. What is being done is doubtless as much as can be accomplished with the money and means available, but the conditions of the city are exceedingly favourable to the breeding of mosquitoes and to the spread of yellow fever, and it appeared to me that in the absence of complete arrangements for water-supply, sewerage, paving and draining, any efforts towards the eradication of mosquitoes would be futile. Negotiations for a loan of fifty million francs for those very necessary purposes have been under consideration for some years, but revolu- tionary troubles and changes of government have delayed their completion and at the time of my visit there appeared little prospect that a radical advancement in sanitation would occur in the near future. The arrangements by which an attempt is made to prevent the spread of yellow fever to the Canal zone by ships visiting the port have already been described, but those arrangements do not apply to ships trading with the ports of other countries than the United States, and such ships usually lie in the river opposite the wharves and frequently become infected. Honolulu.-The protection of the east from yellow fever is dependent in great measure upon the protection of the ports of call in various islands which lie on the route of ships crossing the Pacific Ocean from the endemic area. An examination of the map which accompanies this Section will show that among such ports Honolulu in the Hawaiian Islands is chiefly to be considered. It is situated at latitude 21 30 north of the Equator on the island of Oahu-the second largest of the eight inhabited islands in the Hawaiian group-and, as a result of the development of the natural resources of the islands and because it is used as a port of call by trans-Pacific ships, is rapidly becoming a place of considerable commercial importance. About nine-tenths of the whole trade is with the United States, and practically all the exports (which are chiefly sugar and coffee) go to that country. Local conditions in Honolulu are all the year round favourable to the existence and spread of yellow fever. The climate is remarkably equable, being represented as regards temperature by maxima and minima in the hottest and coolest months respectively of 85 and 65 in August and 80 and 55 in February, and as regards rain by a total fall of about 20 inches which is distributed over every month of the year, but is greatest from November to April. Secondly, the population of about 52,000 is entirely non- immune to yellow fever and is composed largely of Japanese, pure and part Hawaiian, Portuguese, Chinese, Spaniards, Porto Ricans, Koreans and Filipinos, many of whom live in low and insanitary buildings or overcrowded tenement houses in areas where the sanitary conditions leave much to be desired, and where, as a rule, the owners carry out improvements only when forced to do so. Thirdly, although the town has modern arrangements of water-supply, sewage disposal, drainage and paving of the streets, conditions, both natural and arti- ficial, are favourable to the breeding of mosquitoes. It will be seen from the following plan of the city that it extends for a considerable distance parallel to the sea, but is very narrow and the various sections are separated from one another by tortuous streams, large areas of unreclaimed swamp, and flat land, on which there are many ponds, irrigated rice fields and taro patches. Most of these are actual, and all of them are potential, breeding grounds of mosquitoes, 474DE
?22 In this connexion I may note that according to Dr. Van Dine the islands of Hawaii were entirely free from mosquitoes of any kind until 1826 when they were introduced by the sailing ship Wellington from San Blas in Mexico, and that up to the present only three species have been found in the islands, namely stegomyia fasciata, stegomyia scutellaris and culex fatigans. Systematic search for anophelines has been made by entomologists and medical men without their having been found. It is perhaps not very likely that stegomyia scutellaris was introduced from Mexico, because there is no record that it occurs there or in adjacent countries. The following is a list of the places where the larvae of stegomyia mosquitoes have been found in Honolulu :- Fasciata. Scutellaris. The management of sanitary affairs in Honolulu is in the hands of the Board of Health of the territory of Hawaii, consisting of a President, a Secretary and six members, of whom two are medical men. It appears from the annual reports of this Board that prior to 1909 efficient sanitary work was hampered for various reasons. In 1909, however, partly owing to outbreaks of cholera and plague, there was an awakening to the necessity for a more energetic and liberal sanitary policy, with the result that at the present time the territory devotes at least one-fifth of its total revenues to health and sanitation, and the Board of Health is well equipped for a thorough and continuous campaign. For the two years ending June 1913 some of the appropriations are :-                                                            General sanitation ... ...    12,584 Filling insanitary lands   ... ...    50,000 Reclamation of swamp lands ...    7,000 Water-supply ... ...     100,000 Sewers ... ...      30,000 Suppression of contagious diseases and tuberculosis  20,480 Mosquito campaign ... ...    6,000 Rat campaign ... ...     3,600 Through the action of the legislature of 1911 an expert and influential Sanitary Commission was appointed with power to investigate the sanitary conditions of Honolulu with reference to present and future dangers and require- ments and to report the result of such investigation with its recommendations of what work should be done and the necessary plans and specifications for doing it.  This enquiry is being carried on continuously and at the same time a vigorous sanitary policy is being pursued upon the basis of new laws by which the powers of the Board of Health were greatly extended and strengthened. Special campaigns against rats and mosquitoes, and against tuberculosis, leprosy and other particular diseases are a feature of the policy. The anti-mosquito campaign was started in March 1910 and has since been prosecuted with much vigour. At the time of my visit in February 1912 the sanitary authorities of the territory were being assisted in the work of investigation and supervision by Dr. George McCoy of the United States Public Health Service. The campaign has for its chief object the obliteration of the artificial collections of water in which stegomyia mosquitoes chiefly breed, but efforts are also made to diminish the enormous numbers of culex larvae constantly present in the extensive natural collections of water in the neighbourhood of the town. There are 26 sanitary inspectors engaged in searching for breeding places, each man's district com- prising the area occupied by about 2,000 people. The sewer catch basins, of which there are about 400 in the town, have been found to be prolific breeding places as well as numerous cesspools and waste-water holes. Throughout the city, house roof-gutters are one of the most i mportant breeding places of stegomyia mosquitoes and at the time of my visit they were being entirely removed, or perforated so that water could not lodge in them. A systematic examination for breeding places in trees, banana planta- tions and gardens was also in progress, and an endeavour was being made by filling holes in trees with cement, and by clearing away undergrowth, to reduce the output of mosquitoes from such places. Irrigated rice fields and large areas of water on low-lying land were dealt with by stocking them with larvae-eating
?23 fish of the family Poecillidae, a stock of which was obtained from Seabrook in Texas in 1905. The species which thrive best were said to be Gambusia affinis, Fundulus grandis and Molliensia lattipinna ; and the observations I was able to make led me to the conclusion that the irrigation ditches and large areas of water in which there is little or no vegetation are kept remarkably free from mosquito larvae by the fish and that for such breeding places the plan is very useful and effective. It is, however, much less effective where the presence of weed or grass affords shelter to the larvae. Further details-will be given in my report on methods for the destruction of mosquitoes. The campaign against stegomyia has been much facilitated by engaging a lawyer as one of the members of the executive anti-mosquito staff. Each morning he receives a list of addresses of houses where mosquito breeding places have been found, with details of the work required for their remedy, and he spends the whole day in hunting up and interviewing the landlords of the houses, explaining to them the law on the subject, the penalties which neglect of it will incur, and endeavouring to get them to have the work done or to permit the sanitary authorities to do it. In the Chinese and Japanese quarters of the city the seeking out of the landlord, or other person responsible for insanitary conditions, is not the least of the difficulties of the campaign, and the plan just mentioned has proved of great service in securing prompt action and quick results. In the annual report of the Board of Health for 1911 (which is the latest available to me at the time of writing) Dr. T. S. B. Pratt, the Chief Health and Sanitary Officer, makes the following remarks regarding the results of the cam- paign : There has been a great deal of criticism of the work of this campaign, but those who have done the most to find fault did not take the trouble to find out what was being accomplished and what were the difficulties encountered. To talk of eradicating the mosquito from Honolulu is to state the impossible ; to talk of controlling the mosquito so that it is no longer a menace from the health standpoint is to state what is possible. The public must do their share voluntarily or be made to do so, and wet land cultivation within the limits of Honolulu will have to go and low lands must be filled or drained before much headway can be made. From my own observations in February 1912 I came to the conclusion that in all the areas which I examined, and especially in the principal residential and business sections of the city, the work was carried out with such thoroughness and care that it could not fail to bring about the chief object of the campaign, namely, the reduction of stegomyia mosquitoes ; and I formed the opinion that this object had been already in great measure accomplished. The reduction of the other kinds of mosquitoes present in Honolulu is an entirely different and wider problem, and the presence of such mosquitoes was doubtless responsible for the complaints of the residents who still believed that little or no reduction of mosquitoes had resulted from the measures.

Quarantine arrangements.-The chief risk of   infection to Honolulu is from ports in Mexico and South   America, and   the following   occurrence related   to me by Dr. Pratt, Chief Health   and   Sanitary    Officer of the Territorial Govern- ment, illustrates  forcibly   that  the risk   is a real one.    On the 23rd of October 1910   the steamship  Hong Kong  Maru , of the Toyo    Kisen   Kaisha   Line, arrived at    Honolulu from   Manzanillo   having   on board a   Chinaman who was found to be suffering from yellow fever.    Orders were  given that the ship should be anchored outside the harbour, a police guard from the  quarantine station was placed on board to prevent the landing of   any of the   passengers and crew, and she was   fumigated to  destroy   mosquitoes.    On the   27th it   was necessary to change one of the members of the guard, but the man   who was   relieved, instead of returning   to the  quarantine   station, went to   his home.    The   next morning he  was   absent from roll call and   it was   found that he   was lying ill in a small house near the beach.    His illness was   diagnosed   as yellow  fever as he was  at once taken to the   quarantine   camp.    The   hut where he   had   stayed was in a hamlet   of 48   small wooden   houses on an   isolated piece   of ground.    All   the houses were immediately evacuated   and   guards were   stationed to prevent any one entering the area.    The windows   and doors   of the  houses   being left open, all the surrounding bush for a distance of 150 feet from   every dwelling was then thoroughly cleared with the object of driving into the  empty houses any mosqui- toes that might be sheltering in it.    The houses were then  sealed and fumigated three times at   intervals of   24 hours, 10 lbs.   of sulphur   being  used for   every 1,000 cubic feet of space.    Meanwhile   a heavy   barbed  wire fence was erected round the area and for 90 days   after   the last   fumigation   no one was allowed inside it.    All these measures were completed in eight   days, and it was   believed that if any   mosquitoes in the area had bitten   the  infected   patient   they were killed before a sufficient time had   elapsed for   them to   become infective.    The ship   was   again  thoroughly   fumigated   and   after being   detained for a further period equal to the incubation period of the disease was allowed to proceed.    No other case occurred on her or in the town. If the facts are as stated their explanation may be that the infected mos- quito which had got on board at Manzanillo and caused one case during the 10 or 11 days required for the voyage to Honolulu, had bitten the second man while he was assisting in the operations of fumigation. The occurrence indicates that Honolulu is in danger from the importation of infected mosquitoes as well as of patients, and since December 1910 all
?25 vessels from places where mosquitoes are known to be prevalent have been fumi- gated before being permitted to enter the port. For these and all other measures connected with the procedure necessary to prevent the entry of communicable diseases, the United States Government is responsible, and they maintain a well-equipped quarantine station conducted by officers of the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service. It is situated on an artificial island of about 40 acres in area and is connected by a slipway with an isolated wharf to which ships requiring disinfection can be moored, and on which there are disinfecting sheds, apparatus and other arrangements such that passengers, crew and their effects can be quickly and efficiently dealt with and afterwards conveyed to the quaran- tine station without contact with the harbour or town. On the island itself every potential breeding place of mosquitoes has been done away with, and although it is possible that mosquitoes from the town might reach the island (towards which the prevailing winds blow) every building upon it is efficiently screened against their entry. The houses and appurtenances are sufficient for the proper handling at one time of 30 sick persons, 100 first class cabin passen- gers, 300 second class passengers, 600 emigrants and 1,600 troops. The station is equipped with excellent water-supply and water-carriage sewerage systems, electric light and telephone plant, steam laundry, disinfecting apparatus, crema- torium, hospital, dispensary, detention rooms and bacteriological laboratory, all the buildings being kept in a state of perfect order and preparedness. JAPANESE AND CHINESE PORTS. From Honolulu towards the   countries   in the eastern   hemisphere the trade routes are northward to Japan or southward  to   New Zealand and   Australia, the northward    being the route for   ships   bound for Hong    Kong.    Yokohama, the first port of call, is 3,379 miles from Honolulu  and the journey   in a full powered steamship   occupies   about ten days.    Kobe, the   next port of call, is 350 miles further, and Nagasaki, by way of the   Inland Sea,   another 388.     I visited those three ports and the city of Tokyo between   the 7th and 14th cf February.    They lie between the 32nd and 35th degrees of north latitude and although the occur- rence of outbursts of yellow fever in them during the summer months would   not be surprising, the severe cold of winter would   certainly prevent the disease from becoming endemic.    I have only the   scantiest information   to record  regarding conditions in these ports.    The season of my visit was not suitable for ascertain- ing by personal   observation   the species   and prevalence of mosquitoes, for the temperature even at midday was not higher  than 45 F.   and   strong cold winds prevailed ; and   although    I was enabled,    through the   kindness of the Consuls General of Great Britain and the United States, to interview at Yokohama the chief Japanese port and sanitary authorities and the medical officer of the United States Public Health Service who is attached to the American Consulute, and at Tokyo the staff of the Imperial Bacteriological Institute I did not learn more  than   that stegomyia mosquitoes are  thought to be  among   those that   are troublesome in the summer but that no special investigation had been made.    So far as I could ascertain,   the   increased   danger  of   the entry   of yellow   fever into Japan as a result of the construction of the Panama Canal had not as yet engaged the attention of  the   Japanese   authorities   in   the   port of  Yokohama,   but they were greatly interested in the steps taken by the Government   of   India  in  the   matter and it appeared to me possible that my visit might lead to   the consideration   of special precautions. From the appended copy of the present quarantine laws of the Imperial Government it will be seen that for preventing the entry of infectious diseases into Japan reliance is at present placed upon the sanitary inspection of ships (except junks, fishing boats and the like) which arrive at the seven ports of Yokohama, Kobe, Nagasaki, Moji, Shimonoseki, Wakamatsu and Kuchinotsa. Infected or suspected vessels arriving at other ports are required by the local police authorities to proceed to one of the ports where a proper inspection can be undertaken. The periods of detention in quarantine are ten days for plague and 5 days for cholera and yellow fever. Arrangements at the quarantine stations are apparently adapted for the reception of the sick only. So far as I could ascertain there were no arrangements to meet the possibility that it might
?26 be necessary to evacuate a ship infected with yellow  fever and to   destroy the mosquitoes on board. Shanghai.-On February 5th during a stay of a few hours at this port I took the opportunity to consult Dr. Stanley, the Medical Adviser and Bacteriolo- gist to the Municipality. He informed me that the possible introduction of yellow fever after the opening of the Panama Canal had been considered by the authorities and I understood that special regulations to guard against it were contemplated. The species of mosquitoes present in the city during the summer were said to be stegomyia fasciata, anopheles simensia, culex fatigans and armigeres ventralis, but among some mounted examples that were shown to me I found one specimen of stegomyia scutellaris but none of fasciata, and this raised a doubt in Dr. Stanley's mind as to whether stegomyia fasciata really occurs or not. At the time of my visit the weather was too cold for the problem to be settled by personal observation, but I note that the annual report which has appeared since my departure contains a list of mosquitoes which while including scutellaris does not mention fasciata. A special anti-mosquito staff is employed from the beginning of April to the middle of October each year. Except during the summer months the climate is not favourable to mosquitoes and it is possible that a winter and spring campaign having for its object the destruction of the insects in their hibernating stages might be useful. Hong Kong lies slightly above the 22nd degree of north latitude and during more than six months of the year its climate is favourable to the existence of yellow fever. Nearly 5,000 ocean-going vessels enter its port annually and it is the centre of an immense trade in sugar, opium, flour, rice, oil, cotton, tea, silks, salt and other produce. The colony includes (a) the city of Victoria which has a frontage to the sea of nearly five miles on the northern shore of the island of Hong Kong. It contains about 10,000 houses of which all except about 950 are occupied by Chinese-of whom there are 180,000 in the city. Most of the houses are of three or four stories and in many of them the sub-division of the upper floors into cubicles greatly increases the difficulties connected with their sanitation. (b) The harbour between the city and the mainland. It varies in width from about a quarter of a mile in the Lyemun pass on the east to more than three miles on the west. It is the home of about 48,000 Chinese who live on the 12,000 and odd boats belonging to the port and villages of the colony. The boats include 4,300 engaged in passenger and cargo traffic, 4,180 in fishing and 1,690 trading junks. (c) The territory on the mainland known as Kowloon, in which there are about 80,000 Chinese. The sanitary staff of the city of Victoria includes a Medical Officer of Health and ten sanitary inspectors and for Kowloon an Assistant Medical Officer of Health and three inspectors. In addition there are four inspectors in charge of the scavenging work, one inspector of cemeteries and one in charge of the city disinfection station. In the different sanitary districts which are in charge of an inspector the number of Chinese dwellings is usually between 900 and 1,000, the Chinese population in them varying between 16,000 and 25,000. I spent three weeks in the colony during January 1912 and had opportunities of studying the local conditions and of discussing the yellow fever problem in its connexion with India and the Far East, not only with the official authorities of Hong Kong but with members of the United States Public Health and Marine Hospital Service from Manila, who, like myself, were delegates to the congress of the Far Eastern Medical Association which was held from the 22nd to the 27th of January. Up to the time of my visit the authorities of the colony had not taken under consideration the question that special measures for preventing the entry of yellow fever into the port and for putting the city into a condition of preparedness to cope with an epidemic of the disease might be necessary. His Excellency the Governor and other officials were, however, much interested in the subject and it is probable that the attention drawn to it by the action of the Government of India may lead to the initiation of such measures. In my opinion the present quarantine regulations are not in all respects in line with modern requirements and as regards their execution it appeared to me that the arrangements, for the inspection and control of ships could suitably be improved so as to enable the authorities to deal more efficiently with the
?27 enormous traffic of the port. The absence of a properly situated and well equipped quarantine station is unfortunate as the present station at Lai-chi-kok is not in a position to supply the deficiency. One of the most important problems in connexion with the possible spread of yellow fever to the colony is whether stegomyia fasciata does or does not occur there. Measures with a view to diminish potential and actual breeding places of mos- quitoes have been carried on more or less continuously since about 1900, but the only systematic attempt to ascertain what kinds of mosquitoes are present was made by Dr. Thomson as long ago as 1901. He arranged that adult mosquitoes should be collected in the police stations throughout the colony and from the examination of about 32,000 specimens received from those places classified the mosquitoes of the colony as belonging to some 15 species among which were three anophelines, namely, maculatus, simensis, and minimus, and one stegomyia, namely, scutellaris. His paper contains no description of a mosquito with the characteristic markings of fasciata. During my visit I spent as much time as possible in searching favourable parts of the city for larvae of that species, but owing to the unusual coldness of the season it was exceedingly difficult to find mosquitoes of any kind, and the only larvae that I obtained were those of anopheles maculatus, desvoidea obturbans and stegomyia scutellaris. The problem of the presence or absence of fasciata, therefore, was still unsettled, but before I left official arrangements were made for a thorough enquiry into the mos- quitoes of the colony and a matter of such great interest and importance cannot much longer remain in doubt. The island of Singapore is only four days journey from Hong Kong. It lies scarcely more than one degree north of the Equator and climatic and other conditions in it are all the year round favourable to the prevalence of yellow fever in epidemic form. The mean temperature is about 80 F. and the average annual rainfall about 90 inches. There is no marked distinction between the climate at different seasons of the year. Extensive areas of the country are covered with virgin jungle, forests and mangrove swamps, and even within the municipal limits of the city of Singapore much of the land is low-lying and holds numerous ponds and streamlets which are suitable breeding places for mosquitoes. There are about 27,000 houses in the city and the population numbers about 260,000 of whom nearly 195,000 are Chinese, 28,000 Malays and 25,000 Indian. Every year between 100,000 and 200,000 immigrants, mostly agricultural labourers, arrive from China. Conditions throughout the city are very favourable to mosquito life and both stegomyia fasciata and scutellaris, as well as several species of culicines and anophelines, are exceedingly abundant. Although the city is provided with a municipal water-supply the practice of storing water in cisterns, barrels and jars has not been abandoned and stegomyia mosquitoes also find favourable breeding places in the numerous tins, jars, bottles, earthenware vessels, &c., with which the ground in the vicinity of dwellings is strewn. The authorities at Singapore are fully alive to the possibility of infection with yellow fever, but so far as I could learn it is not generally believed that the trade of the port will be materially influenced or increased as a result of the opening of the Panama Canal, and I understood from the Port Health Officer that unless Hong Kong became infected it would not be considered necessary to take special measures of protection. The port already has a large and well-equipped quarantine station (suitable for both Europeans and natives) situated on an island which is free from mosquitoes, and there are also complete arrangements for fumigating ships by means of the Clayton apparatus. The quarantine regula- tions, which are strictly applied, are reproduced in the appendices to this report. S. P. JAMES, Major, I.M.S. 474DE- 325-17-3-13-GCBP  Simla
