SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit to His Grace the Governor in Council the Medical and Sanitary Report on the Native Army of Madras for the year 1877. 2. Seasonal phenomena.2 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT ominous warnings of the preceding year culminated in a famine of grain and of water, in the establishment of relief-camps and institution of relief-works, and in widespread suffering and mortality from starvation and pestilence. During the year under review the famine which commenced in 1876 reached its acmé of severity. Years. Strength. Present. Absent.

Chief causes of invaliding.OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. 5 and the 41st Regiment, stationed at Vizianagrum, last; the former regiment showing a percentage of daily sick to average strength of 1.35 and the latter of 7.19. Between these two extremes the remaining regiments of the army find their position in the scale. In the same list the minimum mortality rate of.44 stands against the 25th Regiment N.I. at Cannanore, and the maximum rate of 2.90 against the 14th Regiment at Vellore. During the year under remark the sepoys and their families have suffered more or less severely from the incidence of the famine and from the very high prices which have ruled in the bazaars, and though this suffering has not added so largely to the general mortality and invaliding as might have been anticipated, it has certainly had the effect of lowering the health standard of the army, a lowering which in all probability will appear in coming years in the shape of increased mortality and invaliding. A year like 1877, which tried the constitu- tions of all within the area of the terrible famine, must be expected not only to produce direct effects, but also to project its influences into the future. At all times the Madras sepoy lives on his pay with more or less difficulty, for the claimants on his purse are not confined to the immediate members of his family, but extend to those who are often able to earn a livelihood for them- selves. In ordinary seasons these claims are met with some self-sacrifice, yet not without a corresponding diminution in the physique of the sepoy; but in seasons like that under remark, the pressure is so seriously increased that its actual result to the soldier can only be estimated accurately by watching the invaliding and mortality returns of the regiment on the one hand, and by personal observation of the physique and capacity for work of the men on the other. Several factors, not susceptible of numerical expression, concur in determining the health state of a regiment, among which climatic and local influences are very important. Cold, wet, windy and malarial stations affect injuriously the Native soldier, who, as a rule, thrives best in warm and dry cantonments on the plains. At the same time it is to be borne in mind that a station usually healthy may become unhealthy in conse- quence of objectionable habits on the part of the population, of badly-constructed and badly-drained lines, of insanitary overcrowded huts and of defective general conservancy. The importance of such local causes is strongly seen in cases where two regiments occupy adjoining lines in the same cantonment and yet present medical experiences so different as those, for example, of the 36th and 23rd Regiments at Bangalore. Local insanitary influences affect powerfully the women but especially the children of a regiment, the diseases and casualties of which classes constitute a very delicate test of the health condition of the lines and of their immediate surroundings. It is also to be noted that the climatic influences of an unhealthy station may for years affect the admission and death returns of a regiment occupying a healthy station, a fact often observed in connection with regiments which have recently returned from a tour of service in British Burmah. On the other hand, regiments may become acclimatised to a certain extent by prolonged residence at unhealthy stations, as may be seen by comparing the percentages of "daily sick" and of "admissions" of the 28th Regiment N.I. at Mercara for 1874, 1875 and 1876 with those of 1877. Such acclimatisation, however, does not take place without serious losses from invaliding and from death. The circumstances of cavalry corps are, as a rule, favorable to low rates of mortality. They are generally stationed at healthy cantonments, they are weak in strength and contain a large proportion of old soldiers, the well-seasoned residue of the stronger corps of former days. The admissions from His Grace the Governor's Body Guard for 1877 are however in excess of the average of the preceding three years, and the mortality exceeds the corresponding average by 1.14 per cent. 2

These facts show what vaccination on the one hand and medical care with sanitation on the other can effect in mitigating and in warding off diseases so fatal as natural small-pox and cholera. There are other preventable diseases affecting the Native Army with which science has yet to grapple, diseases which claim malaria as their cause and which are more destructive to life, to health and to efficiency than small-pox and cholera. 33.

Fitzgerald, Surgeon Gerald Bomford (Bengal Medical Establishment), Surgeon A. N. Rogers-Harrison, the last-named of whom reports as follows: Climate of the Station .The unusual heavy rainfall during the monsoon months caused an increase in sickness from intermittent fever; during the north-east monsoon many of the cases of fever were of the simple continued type, and affections of the eye, digestive system, and abscess were more common than during the warmer months. Climate of the station. Construction of huts .The lines are old and of indifferent construction, the huts being irregular in size, thatched with cocoanut tree leaves, and as usual are very dark and ill-ventilated, as the doorway in the majority of the huts is the only way by which light or fresh air can possibly enter. Construction of huts. Ventilation and drainage of the men's huts, &c .The drainage of the lines and barracks (armouries and guard rooms) is good. The ventilation of the guard rooms and cells is good, but that of the men's huts is very indifferent, and the atmosphere in them at night time must be unpleasantly close and far from pure. Ventilation and drainage of the men's huts, &c. Nuisance, none. It has been difficult to keep the hospital latrine clean on account of the condition of the flooring, and this has been represented to the Commanding Officer, who has communicated with the Public Works Department and the defect is to be remedied. In some cases means exist for conducting the ablution water and urine from the yards of the huts into the open earth drains on the outside; in others no such means exist, and in all cases most of the ablution water and urine soak into the floors of the yards, but I have never observed any objectionable odours accruing from this condition. Nuisance. Water-supply .Owing to the deficient rainfall during the south-west monsoon of 1876 the supply of water began to fail early in the year, and during the two months (April and May) previous to the south-west monsoon of this year all the wells dried up, and water bad to be procured from a distance. Water- supply. Diet .Food-grains were scarce and dear throughout the year owing to the general drought throughout the Presidency during the greater part of the year; excepting fish, almost all provisions were dearer this year than usual. Vegetables were always obtainable, but were less abundant than usual. Diet. Clothing .During the hot months from the end of February till the commencement of the south-west monsoon in June the men Wear white angrikhas with cloth trousers; during the rest of the year cloth clothing is worn. Clothing. Foot soreness .Since the 20th April 398 cases of "foot soreness" have been recorded. The "soreness" is generally abrasion of the skin about the ankles, heels, insteps or toes resulting from friction. Foot soreness. The men are fitted with boots and are enabled by a regimental fund to buy socks at a nominal sum in order to prevent this; but the men have objections to the wearing of the socks, and the majority of the men do not do so, consequently the amount of foot soreness. Duty .Ordinary regimental parades and guards, garrison guards, and, during the last six months, a guard for the Cannanore Jail alternately with the 9th Regiment M.N.I. The average number of nights in bed per week, 6.03. Duty. Drill .Adjutant's drill for recruits in the evening from 4-30 P.M. to 5-30 P.M., four times a week, and also morning drills between 6 A.M. and 7 A.M. five times a week except during the hot weather and south-west monsoon. Drill. Exercises .There is a regimental cricket club and a small gymnasium used by a few men, but the game of cricket is more preferred. Exercises. Vaccination .All the men have been vaccinated or bear marks of previous small-pox. 44 recruits were vaccinated during the year, 8 of whom bore marks of small-pox and afforded 6 modified results and 2 failures; of 12 bearing doubtful marks of small-pox, 3 cases were successful, 4 modified, and 5 failed; of 24 bearing neither marks of small-pox nor vaccination, 7 were successful, 13 modified, and 4 failed. The majority of the children and followers living in the lines have been vaccinated. Vaccination. Epidemic .Cholera broke out in the old town of Cannanore in March, and many cases occurred during April and May, at which time a few sporadic cases occurred within the bazaars in Cantonment limits, but no cases occurred in the regimental lines (26 Regiment M.N.I.), though diarrh48 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. monsoon in June the cholera disappeared from old Cannanore and the neighborhood of the Cantonment.

In the province of Mysore the deaths by cholera increased from 12,087 in 1876 to 58,648 in 1877, by bowel-complaints from 4,752 to 33,781, by fevers from 23,939 to 55,934. Small- pox was four times as fatal as in 1876. In the Ceded Districts cholera was twice as fatal, small-pox and fever three times, and bowel- complaints eight times as fatal in 1877 as in 1876. The mortality from bowel-complaints may safely be taken as an index of the pressure of famine and destitution. " famine diarrhoea" was a complaint well known and dreaded by all officers connected with relief-camps; and I believe it is a fact that fewer recoveries took place from it than from cholera itself. Malarious fever was excessively prevalent and very fatal throughout the entire adminis- trative circle, but especially in the Kurnool and Cuddapah Districts. The mortality from this cause exceeded that from cholera and famine together. It appeared to be but an aggravated. form of the usual autumnal fever which prevails throughout these districts; but whether its peculiar virulence was due to the lowered vitality of the people exposed to the attack, or had some necessary connection with the condition of the soil as to dryness or humidity and consequent ventilation, is a question which can only be suggested but not answered at present. Possibly both conditions may have conduced to its production, and that the great fatality which attended it may have been due to the first-named cause, and its great diffusion and prevalence to the second. Those who have had much experience of cholera epidemics are aware that a heavy fall of rain is often followed by the sudden cessation or rapid decline of that disease, while on the contrary a light shower which only moistens, but does not thoroughly wash or saturate, the soil generally gives it a fresh impulse. Without discussing the exact modes operandi of the apparent cause or the actual relation between the observed phenomena, is it not allow- able to presume from analogy that a light or moderate monsoon, such as that of last year, acting on a soil which had been subjected to an extreme degree of dessication may exert some similar influence on the malarious fever which is endemic in the districts above mentioned, imparting to it an intensity of action and a power of diffusion which it does not possess in the ordinary course of the seasonal phenomena ?

This table indicates similar phenomena in Bellary to those noted in Bangalore, namely, a high temperature with a rainfall above the average. The rain collected amounted to 26.51 inches, being about 8 or 9 above the average for this station. It fell on 71 days of the year and filled all the tanks. A heavy fall late in the season did considerable damage to the dry crops in the north and west of the district. The crops were also injured by locusts and other insects which appeared this year in great numbers in the Bellary and Cuddapah Districts. Sanitary.

The solid and fluid excreta, instead of being received in their proper places, will either be both on the same side of the dividing ridge or watershed (as it may be called) or else each will be on the side where it ought not to be. As there is but one correct position, while the possible variations from it are many, it is evident that the chances in favor of going wrong are immensely increased, and that this form of latrine is but ill-suited for natives. That this is nomere speculative objection has been proved by the history of a latrine on the same plan built in the course of this year for the use of the native servants of the Warrant and Non- Commissioned Officers of the Sappers and Miners at Bangalore, which, although of the smallest size, became so offensive from the very causes just indicated that the arrangements had to be altered at the instance of the Medical Officer. The latrines built in connection with the Native Infantry Hospital at Bellary are examples of good work in the wrong place. Being only separated from the sick wards by the width of the verandah, and being also to windward during the monsoons, they cannot be used for their destined purpose, and are either shut up altogether or used as lumber rooms. That actually in use is a lean-to shed built against the compound wall, difficult to keep clean and overlooked from the verandah of the hospital. The latrines of the Garrison Hospital at Bellary and of the Regimental Hospital at Mercara are in an unsatisfactory state. Their defects have been frequently pointed out, but without effect. The regimental latrines of the Sappers and Miners at Bangalore have been condemned year after year as utterly bad and incapable of being bettered. They were not, however, capable of being worsened. As if they did not already offend sufficiently against sanitary laws, another infraction of them was deliberately perpetrated last year in spite of due warning. A short- covered drain was carried down from the latrine into the main sewer of the bazaar which passes within a few feet of it on a lower level. It serves to conduct the urine and ablution water from the latrine into the sewer, but it acts also as a ventilating shaft for the sewer, the upper end of which opens into the latrine. Two new latrines have, I am told, been sanctioned for the Sappers which are to replace the present ones; if it be so, I venture to express a hope that in their design and construction more regard may be shown to sanitary arrangements than in the instance just mentioned and more forethought than in that of the Bellary latrines.

58 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. These statements, numbered from 1 to 3, represent the health condition of the Native troops in the two military commands daring the past year, and afford the means of comparison with former years. In No. I are shown the strength, sick, admissions, average daily sick, and the loss by death and by invaliding during the year 1877, and in its second table the same facts compared with the previous year. No. II presents the same facts as they occurred in the different corps. And No. III gives a table of comparative health of the two divisions during the last five years. From these tables it appears that the admissions and deaths in 1877 exceeded those of the four preceding years, with the single exception of 1873 for the Mysore Division, in which the rate of admissions was higher, but the mortality less. The admissions were much higher in the Ceded Districts than in the Mysore Division, but this was due principally to the high rate of sickness in the detachments of the 21st and 27th Regiments at Kurnool. In the Mysore Division the highest rate of admission in any corps was 1,172.93 per 1,000 of strength in the 23rd Light Infantry at Bangalore. This regiment occupied the east hutting lines close to the bazaar, and has always been comparatively unhealthy. The healthiest regiment, judged by the same standard, was the 28th Native Infantry at Mercara. This regiment suffered severely when it first went to Mercara, but it has been brought to its present satisfactory condition by rebuilding huts for an entire wing, and by attention to the general sanitary arrangements of the lines, to which must also be added the influence of acclimatisation. Of the regiments serving in the Ceded Districts, omitting the detachments at Kurnool, the 4th Cavalry had the highest rate of admission, and the 20th Native Infantry the lowest. The detachments of the 21st and 27th Native Infantry at Kurnool suffered much from fever which prevailed throughout the whole of that district in a very severe form. The highest rate of mortality among the Mysore Division troops was in the 30th Native Infantry at the French Rocks, being at the rate of 27.21 per 1,000 of strength, and the lowest in the 23rd Light Infantry at Bangalore, viz., 10.52. The former corps lost 5 men by cholera and 4 by intermittent fever, which diseases were epidemic in the surrounding villages.

(6.) Venereal diseases were more prevalent among the sepoys in Bangalore, but less so in Bellary and Mercara than during the previous year. The increase in Bangalore was principally among the Sappers and Miners, working parties of which were frequently sent out into the districts without their families, and returned with a good many cases of the disease. The 23rd and 36th Native Infantry had also a large number of cases than usual, contracted from cooly women who were driven into the town by the pressure of famine. (7.) Rheumatism is another disease which added considerably to the admissions. It was more prevalent in the hot and dry stations of Bellary and Kurnool than in Bangalore and Mercara. A good deal of it was, I have no doubt, of malarious origin, and instances have come under my own observation in which it yielded as readily and completely to quinine, as the paroxysms of intermittent fever; not a little of it also was probably of the kind which might not improperly be called pension rheumatism'-a form of the disease almost peculiar to the sepoys, and for which in most cases the only remedy is that indicated in its name. (8.) Wounds and accidents show a high percentage of admission, but happily no deaths under this head. (9.) Diseases of the eyes were more prevalent than in the previous year. Catarrhal ophthalmia occurs every year at the beginning of the rains, and is disseminated, if not originated by the eye or mango flies which infest every house at that season of the year. (10.) Abscesses and ulcers show a considerable decrease in everystation except Kurnool. This exception is doubtless due to the fact that the detachment at Kurnool was relieved during the year, and as the men had to march from Gooty, the nearest Railway Station, a good many cases of sore feet must have presented themselves. Diseases of the respiratory organs were both less numerous and less fatal in both commands than in the previous year. STATEMENT NO. VII. Invaliding. Diseases. Pensioned or Discharged.

It is satisfactory, as far as the sepoys and recruits are concerned, showing that of the former only 27.94, and of the latter 6.99 per 1,000 are unprotected either by vaccination or previous small-pox; but it leaves much to be desired still as regards the followers and families; of children under six months of age 440 in a thousand is a large number to be unprotected. Statement No. XI shows that 531 operations, of which only 407 were successful, was the total outcome of the labors in this direction of the department, while, according to Statement X, 2,622 individuals are left altogether unprotected. This is not a satisfactory state of things, but Medical Officers have many difficulties to contend with in extending the benefits of vacci- nation to the families of the sepoys. STATEMENT No. XII.

In 1876 it was at the rate of 33.43 per 1,000, but in the year under report it rose to 42.88. The highest rate was 81.22 in the 23rd Light Infantry at Bangalore, the corps in which the mortality among the sepoys was the lowest; and the lowest 12.14 in the 4th Light Cavalry at Bellary. The mortality was above the average in the 27th Native Infantry at Bellary, the 28th Native Infantry at Mercara, in the Sappers and Miners, and 36th Native Infantry, as well as the 23rd Light Infantry already mentioned at Bangalore. It was below the average for the year in the 4th Light Cavalry and 21st Native Infantry at Bellary, and the 30th Native Infantry at the French Rocks. LOCK HOSPITALS. There are two lock hospitals in this circle; one of the first class at Bangalore, and one of the second class at Bellary. Both hospitals increased the numbers on their registers during the past year, and the second class hospital exceeded the first class in this respect. Famine and want drove many women to this mode of life who, under other circumstances, would not have adopted it. The average number on the register in Bangalore was 89, the total treated 559, and the average daily sick 31. 83. There were besides 132 unregistered women treated who applied

Between the Artillery and Cavalry Lines there is certainly a great deal of clan- destine prostitution carried on by grass-cutters, coolies, &c. In the 12th Lancers the Provost Sergeant and his assistants have strict orders to keep all suspicious women away from the lines. The Medical Officer in charge of H.M.'s 2-16th Regiment explaining as follows:- (1.) In the 2-16th Regiment the Regimental Police system for prevention of clandestine prosti- tution is in force, and the disease exhibited in the statement enclosed for information by the Medical Officer in charge of Lock Hospital in the number of admissions in this battalion may very probably account for this; but almost all the men on admission into hospital state that they contracted the disease near the bazaar behind the barracks of the regiment, and in rocks while out walking. (2.) Suggests, in order to prevent clandestine prostitution being carried on, additional police detectives are essentially necessary, and unless this is done, the efforts used for arresting the prevalence of venereal disease in the European troops will not be attained. The Medical Officer in charge of the Lock is of opinion88 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. woman from puerperal fever after confinement.

The conservancy of the station generally, as well as that in the lines of all the regiments, is very well carried out. The public latrines are now effectually cleansed, and a proper staff of scavengers maintained. The streets in the native town are kept clean, and a system has lately been introduced whereby the private latrines in native houses and all compounds and yards will be periodically visited and cleansed by the Municipal scavengers. 1st Regiment Right Cabalry STATION90 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS.

This must, I think, be considered satisfactory as the strength of the regiment was increased by about 50 men during the year. On the other hand a large number of admissions took place, chiefly among the recruits, for contusions caused by falls when at riding-school, kicks of horses, chafes caused by riding, and boils about the seat apparently caused also by irritation of the skin in riding. Three deaths occurred in hospital during the year: 1 from anuerism of the aorta, 1 from general dropsy and anæmia, and 1 from gangrene of the lungs. Deputy-Surgeon General J. R.

A few months ago I directed the Medical Officer to examine every man carefully with a view to ascertain this fact, and Surgeon Lee reported that out of 433 men at Port Blair, the area of the spleen exceeded 20 square inches in 8, 10 per cent. it was above 15 and under 20 square inches in 47 per cent. and under 15 square inches in 29.4 per cent. This prevalence of spleen enlargement will have an important bearing on the efficiency of the regiment for some time to come, and it would seem a wise economy not to keep a regiment more than one year at Port Blair; for although it is possible malarious fever may be reduced in the course of time by sanitary measures, still it will likely always prove a feverish and unhealthy station and seriously damage the health of any regiment occupying it. The health state of the other Regiments serving in the Province does not appear to call for any special remark. The 17th Regiment M.N.I. at Toughoo has sent away sick 13 less than in the previous year; the 6th Regiment 1 less, and the 4th Regiment M.N.I. 7 more. Altogether there is a difference of 20 against 1877 owing to the sickness in the 24th Regiment. Mainly details are shown in the following table:112 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. 4th Regiment Native Infantry.

Total accommodation at Ross and Aberdeen at regulated space for 367 men. I observed however that in all the barracks at Aberdeen a board had been placed fixing the space per man at 50 square feet. If this scale is adopted there is room for about 61 men more, or about 428. The drainage round all the barracks both at Ross and Aberdeen is effected by good brick drains, and the site is highly favorable for this purpose. Water- supply. Water-supply from tanks and wells, and of good quality. Several new wells have been sunk at Aberdeen. I cautioned the Medical officers against the use of the tank water at Aberdeen as it is collected from the surface drainage of surrounding hills which are covered at present with decaying vegetable matter in consequence of the clearing of the jungle. Conservancy. Conservancy of Ross is good, great attention being paid to the removal of all filth and rubbish; the same may be said of " Aberdeen; " much has been done in the way of drainage and clearing of the jungle from surrounding hills; in fact I am inclined to think it would have been better had some of the large forest trees been allowed to remain, but every thing has been swept away, not a tree left standing. I consider, and informed the Medical officer and Commanding officer that further drainage at Aberdeen is still required. The whole site of the station should be thoroughly and systematically subsoil drained like wet lands in England. Fever from which the troops have suffered so much reaches its maximum in the month of July, when the soil which is a stiff retentive clay has become thoroughly saturated with water. I think it is reasonable to attribute the unhealthiness of Aberdeen in a great measure to the excessive dampness of the site. Ross which is a dry site is healthy; all the islands appear healthy, while the mainland is unhealthy, the climatic conditions of islands and mainland being exactly alike. The "Phænix Bay" and swamps to north of Aberdeen still exist; nothing has been done to remove them; they are supposed to contribute to the unhealthiness of Aberdeen. Hospital.
