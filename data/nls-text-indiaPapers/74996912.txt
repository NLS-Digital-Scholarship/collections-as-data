No. 1289. FROM THE SURGEON-GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL SERVICE, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, MILITARY DEPARTMENT. Fort William, the 14th January 1876. SIR, I have the honor to forward, for submission to the Right Hon'ble the Governor General in Council, the Medical and Sanitary Report of the Native Army of Bengal for the year 1874. This report has been compiled partly by Surgeon-Major J. Browne, M.D., and partly by Surgeon K. McLeod, M.D.,ii Sickness and mortality of the native army. Health of Madras troops in Bengal. Number ineffective from sickness. Sick leave. STATEMENT No. II. PER CENT OF STRENGTH. Admis- sions. Daily sick. Deaths. Regular Army... 127.71 4.21 1.34 Central India Force... 88.89 3.15 .92 Punjab Frontier Force... 172.36 4.75 1.36 Army of Bengal... 132.97 4.23 1.31 Madras troops... 106.53 3.20 .91 3. The ratio to strength of sickness and mortality of the whole native army in Bengal and its several sections, is shown in Statement No. II. The sick- ness is computed on strength "present," or that furnishing hospital admissions. Madras regiments serving in Bengal again contrast favorably with Bengal troops in this respect; but their ratios are rather higher than those of the two preceding years. The Punjab Frontier Force maintains its position as the least healthy section of the army. But the figures indicating the sickness of the Central India Force, this year, fall beneath even those of Madras troops. The number of men constantly in hospital, and therefore ineffective, was 2,236, which is equivalent to 3.27 battalions of 715 men, against 3.12 in 1873, calculated on the same principles. Each admission or case spent 11.2 days in hospital, and, each sepoy of the whole army 13, against 11.2 and 13.1 in 1873. In addition to this, 992 men proceeded on sick leave, or 1.6 per cent of strength, against 2.08, 2.4, 2.10, 1.91 and 1.61 in the five preceding years. These men spent 122,543 days on sick leave, thus giving an average of 335.7 men constantly on sick leave, equal to.47 of a battalion. There were thus 2,571 constantly ineffective from sickness; or 4.86 per cent of strength (present) representing a loss of 3½ battalions of the hypothetical strength above indicated. The corresponding figure in 1873 was 3.8, so that the loss of service from sickness has on the whole been less. Deaths. Death-rate. 4. The total number of deaths was 819. Of these 536 occurred in hospital and 25 in the lines, making a total of 561 casualties among the strength "present." The remaining 258 deaths took place among men on leave, escort duty; &c.iii increases very regularly with age and service. The mortality among elderly men in the Punjab Frontier Force is notably severe and disproportionately large, as compared with the regular army and Central India Force. STATEMENT No. IV. STRENGTH.

I shall now proceed to discuss briefly the various circumstances which during the year influenced the health of the native army in the order in which medical officers are required to report on them, and in which they have been touched upon in previous reports. Movements of the native army. Relief move- ments. Camps of exercise. Service movements. Famine duty. Detachments and escorts. Influence of camps of exercise on health. Outposts. 14. The regiments of the native army have been unusually active in 1874. Many of them were on the move at the commencement and close of the year in course of relief. The local corps of the north-eastern frontier interchanged their stations for the first time since their formation. To these movements an increase of both sickness and mortality is attributed by the medical officers in charge of them, but despite of this I would be very loath to view the principle unfavorably; as a rule, the health of men generally improves under canvas, and even in boats I have seen most marked benefit result. Several of the re- giments of the Punjab Frontier Force also moved on relief. There were several gatherings of troops for the purpose of combined exercise and drill. There was a camp at Roorkee at the commencement of the year, another at Punea- lah near Shaikh Budin, in the Tazee Valley, in January and February; and small camps were formed at Rawulpindee and Peshawur at the close of the year. Some of the Kohat regiments were sent on service to Thull, in the Miranzai Valley in February, and the campaign into the Duffla Hills took place in the cold weather of 1874-75. One whole regiment (the 32nd Pioneers) and consider- able detachments of nine others were employed on famine duty in the districts of Behar from March to October. In addition to these movements, which involved whole battalions or large sections of them, there was a constant movement throughout the year of detachments and escort parties. There can be no question that these movements, probably from accidental causes, do occa- sionally seem to affect the health of regiments injuriously; but they are incidents of ordinary service, and, though they have been more numerous in the year under report than usual, it is satisfactory to note that the sickness and death-rates are also lower than usual. The famine duties and Duffla service undoubtedly caused an increase of sickness and mortality among the men employed on them, but there is no evidence to show that the camps of exercise were otherwise than favorable to health, as other similar gatherings have hitherto been. Much of the sanitary success of these camps depends on the careful weeding of sickly men out of regiments; and if, in addition to this precaution, sanitary matters are properly attended to, experience has amply demonstrated the absence of any special risk connected with them. Service at unhealthy outposts, where, moreover, medical care and comforts are not so good as at head- quarters, affects the vital statistics of many regiments unfavorably. This must also be looked upon as one of the exigencies of ordinary service, and I have no particular observation to offer on the subject beyond expressing my belief that the best subordinate available with the regiment should invariably be chosen for independent duties. Full and exact details of all movements are given in the reports of medical officers. Topography and meteoro- ogy. Heavy rain on the Punjab Frontier. Rise of the subsoil water at Meerut. 15. There is nothing very noteworthy in the information recorded by medical officers regarding the physical and meteorological peculiarities of stations. Topographical details have been, with some few exceptions, excluded from this report, because, unless they are shown to have special relation to the events of the year, they are apt to add greatly and unprofitably to the bulk of the report; and they have, as regards most stations, been given with more or less detail in previous volumes. The hot season appears everywhere to have been mild. The rains made their appearance earlier than usual; in some stations an excess of rain is noted, in others a deficiency; but in no case was the departure from the average extreme or remarkable. Along the Punjab Frontier there was an unusually heavy fall, which was specially remarked at Rajanpore and Mooltan, where any slight excess is apt to cause the irrigation canals to overflow and soak the intervening country, thus causing an excessive prevalence of malarious disease. An unusually high flood of the Ganges and Sone is alluded to in the reports from Allahabad and Dinapore. The rise of the subsoil water in the Meerut district alluded to at page 87, is an important observation. The circumstance appears to depend on irrigation, and may have an important bearing on the increasing prevalence of fevers, to which allusion has already been made. The cultivation of trees in stations like Jhansi, Meean Meer, and Peshawur, is a good measure and making progress. The in-
ix fluence of increased irrigation and cultivation in causing an increased rainfall is alluded to by Surgeon-Major Costello, at page 177. On the other hand, Surgeon- Major Dickson states at page 63, that the cutting down of jungles in Rajputana is causing a gradual decrease of rainfall. There can be no question that ve- getation and rain have an intimate reciprocal influence, and modifications such as these would indicate that rain possesses a greater power over meteorology and climate than has hitherto been supposed. The further study of the in- fluence of the exercise of this power on health is one of very great practical importance. Reciprocal influence of vegetation and rain. 16. There is very little new to report regarding New lines for one squadron were built during the year for the 1st Bengal Cavalry at Cawnpore; the lines of the 19th Bengal Cavalry at Lucknow were partly rebuilt, and their ventilation improved; 12 new huts were finished for the 7th Bengal Cavalry at Seetapore; 8 for the married men of the 2nd Goorkhas at Dehra Doon; 4 new barracks for the 11th Native Infantry at Bareilly; new married quarters and huts for the camp-followers of the 2nd Sikh Infantry at Kohat, and new huts for the 16th Native Infantry at Tezpore. In several stations the huts were rendered more comfortable by the addition of verandahs or provision of trees for purposes of shade. The barracks built for the 18th Native Infantry at Agra, which were noticed approvingly in last year's report, continue to give satisfaction. The site and surroundings of some of the lines are commented on unfavorably; the lines of the 24th Native Infantry at Jhansi, 3rd Bengal Cavalry at Nowgong, and 15th Native Infantry at Sealkote, appear to be specially bad. The expedient adopted by the 31st Punjab Native Infantry at Mooltan, namely, placing the men in tents to prevent overcrowding (page 126) is worthy of recommendation and adoption when necessary. New lines. Verandahs and trees. Barracks at Agra. Bad lines. On the Punjab Frontier, however, a fall of unusual extent overtaxed the already insufficient drainage arrangements. This was more especially the case at Edwardesabad, Dera Ismail Khan, Dera Ghazee Khan, and Rajanpore. The drainage of Meean Meer, Roorkee and Mooltan is still reported defective and difficult, owing to the dead level of these stations; some excavations and hollows have been filled up in the latter station, and improvements have been carried out at Alipore and Dehra Doon. Gowhatty and Dinapore suffer from back-water in the rains. An experiment has been made in the former station for the purpose of securing the more rapid emptying of the swamp which lies behind the station. It is also intended to undertake the systematic drainage of the city of Ajmere at an anticipated cost of Rs. 12,000. The drainage of the military cantonment at Silchar is reported to be very defective, and an attempt to improve it by digging a tank in some adjacent swampy ground has not been successful.

The term conservancy embraces every practice and expedient adopted for the purpose of maintaining cleanliness and removing filth. The reports show that this important object is kept very prominently in view by all regimental authorities and their sanitary advisers. In cavalry regiments the problem is a more difficult one on account of the large amount of 'litter' which has to be got rid of. This material can in most places be sold to agriculturists for manure, but when this cannot be done, no practice can be safer than burning it as in the 7th Bengal Cavalry at Seetapore. Burial of so bulky a mass of putrefying material cannot be commended unless it is done in shallow trenches, and the ground so used is speedily cultivated. Special sources of uncleanliness obtain in some stations, which are more difficult to deal with; for example the annually cited " Dorea nullah" at Nowgong. Measures are however, to be adopted to improve this foul channel. Indeed, nullahs, wherever Conservancy. Horse litter. Nullahs. c
x Latrines. they exist, though of admirable use as agents of drainage are always sanitary eye-sores, as they afford such tempting receptacles for filth. So do hollows and pits of all kinds, and it is recognised as an important sanitary measure to fill them up. The conversion of nullahs into regular drains, as has been to some extent done at Dehra Doon, is a practice worthy of encouragement and imitation. That department of conservancy which concerns itself with the disposal of human excreta is, for obvious reasons, specially and pre-eminently important, and forms annually a very prominent subject of attention in these reports. The experience of 1874 is of considerable value, as affecting the opriate and efficient system of disposal of excreta in clear space exists at a reasonable distance from the lines, in static vicinity is sparsely inhabited, or uninhabited, the practice appears to be devoid of harm. In India, the natural agencies for the destruction and removal of putrid material are so many and so quick in operation, that, given these conditions, it is a subject of question whether art or contrivance can improve upon the customs which the instincts of Indian races have called into existence. In most regiments, however, latrines of some kind are in use, and in large populous cantonments, or those situated amidst a dense population, these are absolutely necessary. Deficient latrine accom- modation. The dry-earth system. Deficient establishment of sweepers. Urinals. It is evident from the reports that in very many regiments grave defects in the construction or management of latrines- still exist. Looking to the habits of natives, deficient latrine accommodation, and the distance from the lines at which latrines are often situated, are, as might be anticipated, frequent complaints. These circumstances, combined with the national aversion to using latrines of any sort, often render the attempt to introduce them nugatory. The trench system whether carried out by means of wheeled compartments or sufficient number of compartments, in which kept separate; the former promptly deodorised with powdered dry-earth, speedily removed and buried in trenches, the land so used being subsequently cultivated, and the latter carried off in water-tight conduits or receptacles, and also committed to shallow trenches. In such stations as Jhansi, however, physical obstacles exist to the practice of even this modification of the trench system (p. 37). The latrine designed by Dr. Cowie at Alipore, (vide p. 2 of report of 1873), appears to succeed well. Deficient establishment of sweepers is assigned by several medical officers as a cause of failure of any system of latrines (pp., 1, 188 and 194). The private latrines of Madras regiments continue to be a source of difficulty in the conservancy of these regiments. The excellent measure of providing urinals for native regiments is making some progress. Surgeon- Major Eteson describes at page 100 an arrangement which he has introduced in the Sappers and Miners, and which seems well suited for its purpose. Surgeon Gardener's urinals (vide page 181 of report of 1873) in the 29th Punjab Native Infantry give satisfaction, and similar arrangements have been adopted in the 30th Punjab Native Infantry. On the whole, it is evident that the very important subject of conservancy continues to obtain close attention, but that many and serious sanitary defects still exist under this head. Water-supply. 19. The arrangements for supplying regiments with water for drinking and cooking purposes, as pure as it can be found and kept, are very much the same as in previous years. All the usual precautions for water conservancy seem to be adopted, more especially the reservation of the best source for consumption, drawing from elsewhere that required for ordinary use, and the preservation of wells and other sources from palpable contamination. The regiments stationed in the vicinity of Calcutta enjoy the benefit of the excellent water supplied by
xi the municipality. The medical officer of the 37th Native Infantry believes that bowel complaints have become rarer in consequence. The Barrackpore regi- ments have not as yet been able to make use of the municipal water, though it passes through the station. The covered masonry channel by which water is supplied to the 2nd Goorkhas at Dehra Doon gives satisfaction, as also does the similar arrangement at Kohat. The distribution in the latter station has now been extended to the cavalry lines. At Peshawur the arrangements for distributing the water of the Bara river by means of a covered channel are in progress. Attempts have been made in the several regiments stationed there to improve the water-supply, more particularly in the 30th Punjab Native Infantry, where a system of filtration has been introduced. In the lines of the 12th Bengal Cavalry at this station, an old well has been re-opened and put in thorough working order at a cost of Rs. 1,400, defrayed by the regiment. In several stations the wells are reported to be brackish, as at Dinapore, Agra and Morar; and a water which if not regularly drawn becomes putrid, as in the 23rd Punjab Native Infantry at Jhelum, cannot be a safe source of supply. The arrangements for the conservation of water at Kherrwara are, it is evident from Surgeon-Major L. F. Dickson's report, (page 64) inadequate, but the defects are understood and acknowledged, and it is to be hoped that action will be taken ere long to remedy them. No systematic analyses of water were made during the year, except in Calcutta, where the municipal water is subjected to a regular chemical examination. Surgeon-Major G. A. Watson's pump continues to work well in the canvalry lines at Mooltan, but in every other station primitive and less cleanly methods are employed to draw water.

Food-supplies were plentiful, good, and cheap throughout the presi- dency, and the evidence recorded by medical officers goes to show that the native army was well fed and in good physique. There are three classes of men whose feeding requires to be specially looked afterxii Experiments. Various experiments have been made with a view to devise a satisfactory shoe (pages 20, 28 and 108), but with no very promising result. The 17th Native In- fantry, 33rd Native Infantry and 2nd Sikh Infantry, wore native shoes on the march with benefit, and this practice is frequently adopted. This fact of itself demonstrates the practical imperfection of the present system. Uniform. Undress cloth- ing. No change has occurred during the year in the uniform of the native army, which is unanimously pronounced as suited to the climate and duties. The native, or undress clothing worn by the men when off duty, is by many officers considered to afford inadequate protection against cold, and this is put down as a cause of chest disease, especially on the Punjab Frontier. The complaint is made mainly regarding Madras regiments stationed in Central India and the regiments garrisoning the Punjab and its frontier. The reports show, however, that medical officers are fully alive to this important matter, and that, in concert with regimental authorities, measures are adopted to induce the sepoys to provide themselves with a sufficiency of warm clothing and to supply it to those (recruits and married men) who are unable to supply themselves. Duty. At the Presi- dency and Peshawur. Famine duties. 22. Duty is still noted as being very heavy at Fort William, Alipore, and Barrackpore, at Peshawur, and in the regiments stationed in Rajputana and Central India, which have to furnish many escorts and detachments. Else- where the work required of sepoys is by no means severe. The famine in Behar was the occasion of an increase of labor directly to the troops which were employed there, and indirectly to the regiments from which the detach- ments were drawn, which had to perform the same duties with diminished num- bers. It does not appear that men were anywhere subjected to exposure or fatigue which could not fairly be held to constitute justifiable conditions of the occupation of soldiery.

A requisition for a new hospital, which appears absolutely necessary, has been submitted. The hospital occupied by the 5th Madras Native Infantry at Saugor is obviously unsuited to its purpose, and a new building is needed. The hospital arrangements of the 2nd Bengal Cavalry were defective while the regiment was cantoned at Fyzabad,*but as the corps has now moved to Segowlie, the remarks made in the report of the medical officer cease to apply. A new hospital, much required, has not yet been provided for the 36th Native Infantry at Agra, though its erection was in the last report said to have been sanctioned. The hospital occupied by the 17th Native Infantry at Morar is pronounced to be irremediably bad. The remarks recorded last year regarding the hospitals of the Punjab Fron- tier still apply, that of the Guides at Murdan being exceptionally inappropriate. In some stations, such as Mooltan and Meerut, tents had to be pitched for the accommodation of an exceptionally large number of sickxiv STATEMENT No. X. Prevalent diseases. DISEASES.

The subject of lock hospitals is brought under the notice of Government elsewhere.

The reports now submitted indicate, I am gratified to state, a con- tinued appreciation of the medical and sanitary requirements of the native army, and an earnest endeavour on the part of medical officers to remedy known sanitary defects, and promote measures calculated to ameliorate the health and comfort of the native soldiers serving in the Bengal Presidency.

The clearing out also of the large drain running along the Diamond Harbour road had been commenced; this latter is a very necessary measure; as this drain, from being obstructed with jungle, branches of trees, &c., which prevented the free running off of the water, was most probably a cause of disease. The system of conservancy and latrines, as formerly described, has worked well, though, no doubt, greater cleanliness would be obtained by the use of the "dry-earth" system Conservancy: V.

It is about as perfect as the nature of the ground and the water level of the river will admit of. A portion of ground to the north of the lines is a perfect swamp during, and for some time after, the rains.

Lime-juice and rum were issued to those who had any scorbutic taint, with great benefit. The Deputy Surgeon-General thinks that the drinking water, which contains more organic matter and chlorides than are consistent with purity, may be one of the causes contributing to debility and scurvy. Dr. Duncan had to abandon all attempts at purifying the water for hospital use, as the sepoys refused to drink it. The hospital is a capacious, well-ventilated building. Medical arrange- ments were satisfactory, with the exception that the poisons were not kept separate from the other medicines. 39th (The Allygurh) Regiment, Aatibe Infantry,10 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL.

Regarding the ammunition boots, the medical officer remarks:ALLAHABAD DIVISION. 13 as would appear to be the plan in Madras regiments, it should be made pucca , or better still, shallow iron pans filled with dry-earth should be used. The drains also should be of terrace work. The hospital was found to be in excellent order and well equipped. The regiment does not appear to have enjoyed the same health in 1874 as it did in the two previous years. In 1872 there were 149 admissions into hospital, with a daily sick-rate of 5.8; in 1873 the figures were slightly lower, 142 and 5.6 respectively, but in 1874 the ad- missions amounted to 270, and the daily sick to 18.02.

Since the regiment has been at Allahabad, there has been an increasing tendency to a change in this direction; and if this continues, a large unfordable body of water will flow close to the right bank. In one respect this is not a desirable change, as a large expanse of dry shifting sand, which is much resorted to by the men, and particularly the camp followers, for the purposes of nature, may be shut off. During the cold and hot seasons this place affords an excellent natural latrine; all excreta being soon covered up by the light sand, blown about by the wind. Lines, bar- racks, or huts. IV.

A number of men therefore resort to fields just outside the canton- ment boundary and close to the lines. The latrine accommodation for cantonments is quite insufficient, but the funds at the dis- posal of the cantonment committee do not allow of an increase of latrines and establishments. Water-supply. VIII. Water-supply .ALLAHABAD DIVISION. 23 XVI. Principal causes of sickness .24 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. Physique of the regiment. In spite of the large venereal sick list throughout the year, the regiment is in very good physical condition. The men are well fed, have a good carriage and show a smart- ness at their exercises which does not indicate weakness of frame. The strength of the regiment, which was only 674 in May, has been brought up to the full complement of 712 at the end of the year. The recruits were carefully selected and have good physique and good sight. The sight was always carefully tested before enlistment. I have already mentioned that gymnastics have done much to develop the physique of the younger men. Invaliding. About 25 men will be sent to the next invaliding committee from regimental head- quarters, but there is a number of old men serving with the detachment at Berhampore who will also be sent up to be invalided. Among the men to be sent from head quarters are about eight or ten who are the sad wrecks of syphilitic poisoning in middle-aged men. A regiment broken up into five detachments during various portions of the year often deteriorates considerably. I am glad to report that it has not been the case in the 13th Native Infantry during 1874, and that I feel confident that both the Major General Commanding the division and the Deputy Surgeon-General of the circle will report favourably on the physique of the corps, although we have had so much to contend with during the past year.

In the ordinary course of events no year for a long cycle will show such a happy result as the one just gone by; but, given all the favourable circumstances I have just alluded to, the results are surely more than satisfactory when in the short space of four years a regiment heading the Bengal Army in sickness and mortality that had been almost decimated in one year and that was reported as totally unfit for service, is brought to such a state that it was even last year reported as one of the healthiest, and with the most physically robust men in the service, how much more so is it this year when the admissions are fewer than those of last year by 28 and the mortality considerably less than one-half? Clothing. From the first shower of the rains all men on night duty in the regiment were obliged to wear a warm coat, and although it might at times be a little uncomfortable, still there was the one great fact in its favor that at that notedly feverish time little or no increase in that disease took place. Many men take it almost as a necessary consequence that fevers will and must increase in the rains; if they do, the men will most certainly suffer for it afterwards in being (debilitated from that most debilitating disease) utterly unable to withstand the great variations of temperature later on as the cold weather is setting in. Advantage of preventing fever in the rains. If fevers are prevented in the rains you will have your men not alone able to stand, but to enjoy and benefit by, the cold weather, so that when the next hot season sets in, they may be able to resist the debilitating effects which most certainly accompany it. Inspection. Sanitary conditions. Health of the men. Hospital. Deputy Surgeon-General J. P. Walker made the medical inspection of this regiment on the 24th March 1875. He reports all the sanitary arrange- ments connected with the lines, huts, drainage, water-supply, &c., &c., to have been very satisfactory. The men were inspected in undress on parade, and found to be in good condition for service, and the recruits had been carefully selected. The hospital and its belongings were clean and tidy, the treatment of the patients was quite satisfactory, and the medical details of the hospital were well carried out.

The hospital has been previously described; with 20 patients in it each one would have 600 cubic feet; the ventilation is good; there is not any ward for the isolation of patients; the medicines were in sufficient quantity, and the instruments were clean and in good order. The quarters for the hospital assist- ants are reported on as not being good, and there are no cook or servants' houses attached to the hospital: the hospital latrine was clean, and on " the dry-earth" system. 9th Regiment Native InfantryGWALIOR DISTRICT. 33 The latrines belonging to the 9th Regiment Native Infantry are situate to the south- west end of the lines on the east bank of the Morar river. They are supposed to be used by the sepoys and followers. The trench system is in use; as at present worked, it is a failure. The ground is free from odour during the dry weather, but as there is no protec- tion against the rains, I cannot think it can then be an efficient system. The ground is regu- larly planted. The latrine is formed by light moveable screens, forming 45 compartments; fresh trenches are dug daily. A second latrine of 16 compartments for women is placed at a distance to the north of the above. The construction of these latrines is faulty in the extreme. They consist of long screens with partitions placed at right angles which divide each screen into five parts. A series of such screens are placed one before the other. As a conse- quence a man goes to E, say, and, finding it vacant, occupies it; no man will pass by him to A, B, C, or D, by reason of caste prejudice; neither will he permit the sweeper to go in to clean the latrine: thus some half dozen men may completely occupy the structure. The latrine should be made in one long row, a large space being left between the compartments and the outside screen. The present latrine is not nearly sufficient, for all the men turn out in the early morning about 4 A. M., while it is still dark; they cannot all use the latrines, and a piece of ground has to be marked off for them. This the sweepers clean afterwards; the excreta being placed in the trenches. The latrines should be covered in as a protection against the rains. Trench latrines. Defects of latrine. VIII. Water-supply.34 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL.

Vaccination. Vaccination was very satisfactorily attended to, 369 cases having been successfully vaccinated. Sanitary im- provements. Several minor sanitary measures recommended by the medical officer were carried out during the year. Inspection. The regimental hospital and lines of this regiment were inspected by Deputy Surgeon-General R. Cockburn on the 6th January 1875. Sanitary conditions. The lines were rather overcrowded with families, and the ventilation of the huts was not good. The drainage was good and conservancy of the lines was well attended to; the small latrine attached to each hut was kept as clean as such an objectionable arrangement could be; dry earth was used for the solid excreta, but the urine and water ran off by a drain into a gurrah and was removed daily. Hospital. The hospital is a large, lofty and well ventilated building, and afforded ample accommodation for the requirements of the regiment. The medical details of the hospital were well carried out, and all the arrangements for the care and welfare of the sick were most satisfactory. Detachment, 3rd Regiment Madras Light Cabalrd, Jubbulpore. Detachment 3rd M. L. C. This detachment, which has also been under Surgeon-Major Theobald's charge throughout the year, was inspected on the same day. The lines were in good repair and clean; other sanitary conditions were as previously reported. The sick are treated in the infantry hospital. There was no man in hospital on the day of inspection, but the arrangements were satisfactory. The Deputy Surgeon- General saw all the troopers in undress. " Most of them," he observes " are rather old from there having been no recruiting for a long time past, but they are a fine set of men and apparenty properly nourished." The lock- hospital. The lock-hospital at Jubbulpore has continued under the charge of Surgeon-Major W. R. Rice during the year. The Act was extended in June 1874 to the city, and an examination room was opened there for the conveni- ence of the women. Registration is reported to be not as complete as it ought to be in the city. A large proportion of the city prostitutes brought on the register were found to be diseased. The average number on the register was 89. The number has risen since the city women were included to 110. The attendance for examination was good, except in the city, where the women have not as yet submitted to discipline. The dhais are found very useful in detecting disease. The admissions were 177 in number against 104 in 1873. The amount of venereal disease among European troops was 89 per 1,000. The admissions amounted to 71, of which 34 were for primary syphilis, and 22 for gonorrhSAUGOR DISTRICT. 41 VIII.

These cases were all treated with large doses of quinine during the remission without any apparent benefit, and were only saved by a liberal use of mutton broth, with stimulants: slight bronchitis was a common complication, In no case was there any marked splenitis. The five deaths, as stated before, were all traceable to retreated attacks of fever. Inspection. Deputy Surgeon-General J. Pattison Walker, M. D., paid a visit of inspec- tion to the wing on the 12th March 1875. He found the sanitary conditions satisfactory and saw all the men in undress. "They presented on the whole a satisfactory appearance, though the men bore traces of having suffered severely from July to December 1874 from endemic ague" Dr. Walker attributes this ague to seasonal influences affecting with exceptional severity the men in their first year of residence. at Banda. 11th Regiment, Madras Native Infantry,47 SAUGOR DISTRICT.

Sanitary im- provements. Deputy Surgeon-General J. T. C. Ross inspected the hospital on the 14th September 1874. He remarks that the station of Nowgong is much overgrown: hedges, and trees of officers' compounds require to be lowered and trimmed. The public latrine was moved a quarter of a mile further back than it was in 1873: its distance and difficulty of access is objectionable. Mr. Ross urges the adoption of the cheap sort of latrine in use at Jubbulpore. There was much improvement in the state of the lines since 1873: drainage was better attended to, and the whole place had a more cared for look; the site is low, but the position for surface drainage has been made the most of; the trench systen is in use, and well carried out. There is some fine cultivation over the filled-in trenches. The hospital was clean and in excellent order, but is distant one-fourth of a mile from the lines: the patients were clean and comfort- able; all hospital and medical details were well looked after.

Sickness, Mortality, and Invaliding .52 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. General features. Geology. feet. The force quartered in it during 1874 consisted of the 9th Bengal Cavalry and the Deolee Infantry force, the lines for which, and the bungalows for officers, are built on a nar- row ridge running from a south-west to a north-easterly direction, with a gradual slope in three directions, viz., east, west, and south, so that the natural drainage is excellent, and no stagnant water lies about anywhere. The general features of the surrounding country present a far less wearisome appearance than most stations in India, inasmuch as the country is more or less undulating, and on nearly all sides, at varying distances, there are low, rocky hills, which break the view, some rugged and barren, others covered with low tree jungle. The geological formation is primary or metamorphic, consisting of gneiss, mica-schist, and granite, whilst slate and limestone are also plentifully found. The soil of the undulating plains varies in thickness, from 6 inches to 2 or 3 feet, according to situation. It is every- where, however, stiff, tenacious, and dark-coloured (cotton soil), and is difficult to work and cultivate, requiring much toil to render it fit for seed sowing. Directly under the soil is a laver of kunkur, varying in thickness, and beneath the kunkur the primary rock. Cultivation. Cultivation of the soil is by no means extensive around Deolee, except in the imme- diate neighbourhood of villages, and there only, in my experience, are to be found even fair crops of such things as are usually grown, viz., wheat, cotton, poppies, Indian corn. Generally speaking, water is not very near the surface, so that good, or even fair, crops are hardly ob- tained except by repeated well-irrigation. Add to this, that the population is sparse and the soil hard to work, and it will readily be believed that the amount of each harvest is little more than sufficient to meet the ordinary requirements of the existing population, whereas disease and starvation are the usual results of a dry season and bad harvest in these parts. Vegetation. In the uncultivated parts of the country, rank grass and low scrubby thorn flourish abundantly, and are the harbour of jackals, pigs, partridges, &c. Trees are scarce, and, as a rule, are only to be found around ponds and jheels in the vicinity of villages. Their variety is small, such as the peepul, bhur, tamarind, acacia, and date palm. Wood, for building purposes, is consequently dear and difficult to obtain, though firewood of an inferior quality, collected from the low tree jungle of the neighbouring hills, is tolerably cheap. Marshes and jungle. There are neither marshes nor tree jungle within a radius of some miles of Deolee. Water-level. The depths at which water is obtained beneath the surface varies considerably, according to season and situation. On the rising portions of the undulating plains it is usually found at a level of from 20 to 40 featRAJPOOTANA. 53 XI.

Every one is aware of the stuffy close feeling of a native but at all times; how much more so during the hot months and rains? Men naturally, sleep outside, and with only a light covering. Towards morning there is often a great change of temperature, and heavy dew falls upon the sleeper unless he be under some kind of shelter. Fever is the result, and once occurring, it occurs again twice. or three. In fact, from my observation, most of the cases of fever here last autumn were due to the cause I have noticed, irrespective of malarious influences, which doubtless exist, though they hate no Speciality as far as Deolee and its surroundings are concerned. Venereal diseases. On the whole, however, and taking into consideration the fact, that there are still a great number of old men in this regiment who were recruited in the mutiny, the general health has been good. There were 20 cases of venereal during the year; most of these occurred at Jhausi among Pathans, who, as a rule, are dirty in their habits, and suffer more from that disease than other classes. Recruits. Of the recruits entertained, 29 in number, one did not join, and 2 had to be discharged: one on account of diseased cornea, the other for bad physique. These 2 men were enlisted in the Punjab, and after travelling several hundred miles were sent back; which very fact alone is sufficient to deter others from enlisting. As far as my experience goes, the enlistment of men for distant regiments is far, from satisfactory. Sufficient care and attention are not paid to the subject; and the result is that, of late years, the stamp of men has Fallen considerably both as regards classs and physique. Inspection. Deputy Surgeon-General E. C. Thorp, M. D., inspected On the 27th of No- vember 1874. He agrees with the medical officer regarding the sanitary defects of the lines; in other respects he found the sanitary circumstances of the regi- ment favorable.

"Line sick" Surgeon Edis calculates that the present hospital is capable of accommo- dating 8 men at 100 superficial and 1,500 cubic feet per man, or about 2 per cent. of the strength of the regiment. This accommodation would be quite insufficient but for the practice prevailing in cavalry regiments of dividing the sick into "sick in hospital" and "line sick." The latter are allowed to live in their huts and excused more or less duty according to the gravity of their indisposition: they have not hitherto been included in returns, but the medi- cal officer will in future include all men unfit from sickness to perform all their duties, whether they are in hospital or in the lines.

The numbers were 548, and 326, and the principal diseases agues, slight injuries, boils, skin diseases and mild rheumatic affections. "Line sick." On looking at the medical and sanitary report of the Native Army of Bengal for the years 1869, 1870, 1871, 1872, and 1873, it would appear that this regiment in each of the above periods gave fewer admissions per cent. of strength than any other corps in the Bengal Presidency. The subjoined table will show at a glance the great differences between the per- centages of admissions to strength as given in the reports, and those actually obtaining when all the sick treated are made the bases of calculation:60 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. Inspection. Deputy Surgeon-General E. C. Thorp, M. D., inspected on the 27th of February 1875. The sanitary and medical duties connected with the regiment were being satisfactorily performed. There were 5 men in hospital, and 3 "line sick." The only defects observed were a want of cook-rooms, dead-house, servants' houses, and hospitals assistants' quarters connected with the hospital, but plans or these had been prepared, and sanction obtained for their construction. 2nd Central India ForseCENTRAL INDIA. 61 XV.62 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. application of the pencil of "eye-caustic". If there be chemosis accompanied by livid redness and swelling of the skin covering the eyelids, chloroform is administered prior to the applica- tion of the pencil of "eye-caustic" in the cases in which the disease attacks young children. And sometimes it is found expedient to administer the anæsthetic in the case of adults labour- ing under the disease in its severe form. Of late the purulent form is comparatively rarely seen, because the men of the regiment and the inhabitants both of Augur and Goonah have learned the value of the early application of this remedy in the treatment of this disease. Formerly I used to apply sweet oil to the conjunctiva of both eyelids after applying the pen- cil of "eye-caustic," but I find that this is not necessary. The particles of the "eye-caustic" mingling with the tears form an excellent eye-wash, and in no case has its application been followed by injurious effects. It is a somewhat painful remedy, but any drawback in this respect is counterbalanced by the great rapidity with which it effects a cure. Several hundreds of cases have been treated both at Augur and Goonah by this method, and almost always with complete success. Megwar Bheel Corps63 CENTRAL INDIA.

It is difficult,to avoid this in men previously unaccustomed to a boot of any kind, and I am about to recommend the substitu- tion of a shoe. The "Blucher" boot of hard native leather is as uncomfortable a form of foot covering as could possibly be devised; and scarcely a single regimental medical officer will be found to speak favorably of it. If socks were worn it might do, but they are quite beyond the means of a sepoy on Rs. 5, 6, and 7 per month. The European ammunition boot has been very much liked by the few corps to which it has ever been served out, the 8th Bombay Native Infantry among the number; and for regimental duty alone it will last an indefinite time, perhaps three years, but the price, Rs. 5-8 to Rs. 6, will always be found prohibitive.

Some men had two on the same leg, and some one on each leg in symmetrical positions. They generally attacked either the leg or thigh, especially Scarpa's triangle or its neighbourhood.

There is no room for carrying out the trench system of latrines, but, with improvements, the present system might work satisfactorily. As regards the hospital, Dr. Smith agrees with his predecessor in the propriety of removing the batten doors and substituting glass doors. Huts for the treatment of infectious diseases are required. A portion of each verandah had been partitioned off as a bath-room. On the day of inspection all the hospi- tal arrangements were found in a satisfactory state. The regiment had suf- fered much from malarious fever, but not so much as the 5th Native Infantry, owing, it is believed, to the better physique of the men and their shorter residence in the station. There are a convalescent list and a list of "line duty" men in the regiment. Dr. Smith very properly considers that all men really sick should be shown as such in the hospital return. Hospital.

Though the men of the regiment have been prone to "general debility" from a variety of causes, both at Dacca and Benares, between the year 1867 and 1872, "spleen disease" has been quite exceptional, and nearly always traced to attacks of ague, from which the men had suffered when at their homes on furlough. Among re- cruits. The right wing, tor some days at Umballa, and on the return march, was in sole charge of 3rd class Hospital Assistant Kuramut Oollah, an intelligent and efficient medical subordinate. Deputy Surgeon-General C. M. Smith visited the hospital of this regi- ment repeatedly during the year, and made a formal inspection on the 31st of December. He found the sanitary and medical arrangements satisfactory. The detached building (an old bell of arms) used for infectious diseases would be greatly improved by being thatched and furnished with verandahs; a dead-house is also required. A bath-room has been constructed in the hospital verandah, and furnished according to order. The regiment had been very sickly during the year owing to the great prevalence of malarious fever; this has not been con- fined to the native troops. Dr. Moir, the civil surgeon of Meerut, has shown in a special report to the Government of the North-Western Provinces, " that the admissions from fevers of malarious origin have, during the past five years, more than doubled amongst the European soldiers and in the civil hospital, and more than trebled amongst the native troops, while in the jail population they are more than quadrupled." He attributes this to a cyclical prevalence of this class of diseases. By other authorities it is attributed to canal irrigation. Dr. Smith inspected all the men in March, and found a large proportion of them suffering from splenic enlargement. Inspection. Improvements suggested. Prevalence of malarious fever in Meerut.

The question of dieting patients properly in hospital without offending the prejudices of caste is one of considerable difficulty, though felt, perhaps, less in this regiment than most; but the pay being insufficient, if the patient remai long in, it is impossible to do so, without further means being put at the disposal of the surgeon. Hospital bedding is also much required, especially in cases that remain long in hospital, whensu their own scanty supply of bedding does not allow of the necessary change and cleanliness.

Syphilis. There were no less than 59 admissions from primary syphilis in the regiment during 1874, of which 39 occurred in the detachments in Tirhoot, where, doubtless, the famine augmented the temptation and disease. Sixteen cases occurred at Roorkee, but very few of them were contracted here; and four at Peshawur. There were also 20 admissions from secondary symp- toms, 13 at Roorkee, nearly all being men of famine district detachments. No doubt, the end of this disease, as regards military efficiency, has not yet arrived. The men who have this year been admitted for syphilis will, in a majority of cases, be the rheumatic patients of following years; and, if the system of short enlistments, as advocated above, were introduced, I should, as a rule, reject men for re-engagement whose medical history sheets showed a pro- nounced syphilitic taint. The hospital assistants who were in medical charge of detachments in the famine districts seem to have signally failed in their treatment. Prolonged stay in hospital, indolent hard chancres and sequelæ appear to have generally resulted from infection. It is possible that the virus may have been locally very bad; but, so far as I could learn, the treatment was entirely palliative, and very seldom constitutional. Lock hospital. There is a lock hospital at Roorkee under my care; but the registered and examined women do not include the class with whom the sepoys are intimate, and hence there is no real protection against the disease in respect of them. Nevertheless, there is not any very severe type of the disease at Roorkee. I gather from different sources that the sepoys are much in the habit of avoiding hospital treatment and trusting to country practitioners for an ordinary soft chancre. The cleanly habits, temperate diet, and abstemiousness generally make the cure a very easy matter. Nervous di- seases, &c. The succeeding group of local diseases, viz ., nervous, eye, ear, respiratory, have all been few and mild. A case of' valvular disease of the heart in a young Pathan at Peshawur appear- ed due, in the beginning, to an injury sustained at Chuckrata four years previously, from a heavy clod of earth striking him on the back. The Peshawur detachment furnishes by far the largest proportion of lung disease, bronchitis, pleurisy, pneumonia, asthma, and phthisis, most likely due to ague complications in weakly men. Digestive di- seases. Diseases of the digestive system are increased this year, giving 161 admissions.

Miasmatic125 LAHORE DIVISION. *This fact seems to have been overlooked by all previous observers, and due weight has not been given to it in the causation of the fever which has been notorious in Mooltan for years past every year, an immense surface of rotting vegetation is exposed to the direct rays of a power- ful sun*. Of the effect of this there can be no doubt. It is very appreciable to the men, even when travelling by train, through the district contiguous to the river, the residents of which, Europeans as well as Natives, exhibit marked symptoms of marsh ague. Decaying vegetation. The European as well as the Eurasian and Native employés of the Indus Valley State Railway, which runs contiguous to the Chenab and Indus rivers, and crosses the Sutlej about 50 miles south of Mooltan, suffer severely from ague accompanied by splenic enlargements and followed by a cachetic condition of the system. These sequelæ in many instances are of so obstinate a character as to require the removal of the sufferers from the localities in which attacked. Temporary removal, however, is not always attended by such benefit as is desired; the fever recurs again and again, and a permanent transfer becomes a necessity. The system of irrigation canals of this district I look upon as another factor in the production of the fever at Mooltan, though in a minor degree. The canals form a perfect net work throughout the whole district and around the immediate neighbourhood of the station, and without doubt contribute their share in the causation of disease. It is true they contain running water, but in many of them the stream is sluggish, and in all there is more or less a growth of vegetation. They are fed by the inundations of the rivers, and dry up as the inundations subside. An immense surface of water pretty freely contaminated with vegetable as well as animal decay, is thus exposed to a drying process which cannot fail to assist in the production of materials prejudicial to health. Irrigation. My observations of the fever and its causes during the last outbreak do not bear out the conclusions which Dr. Gunn my predecessor has arrived at. Although I cannot but admit that great diurnal and nocturnal changes of temperature do take considerable part in the causation of disease, yet I cannot admit that such changes are, or can be, the chief cause of so extensive an outbreak of a fever of so characteristic a malarious type as we have in Mooltan every year during the autumn. In August the last stage characterised the fever; it was of long duration, occasionally it had atendency to a continued character, and was accompanied by severe headache and bilious vomiting. In September splenic enlargements were the rule, and there was an occasional tendency to intestinal irritation, and to collapse after excessive sudoresis. Some of the spleens were of such enormous size, that I doubt if they were only of one year's growth. In October there was a marked tendency to critical discharges and resulting collapse. Towards the end of the month, and during the two sub- sequent ones, scurvy began to show itself. In November and December the cold fit was the characteristic symptom126 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. Recommend- ations. XVIII.

The building used as a station staff hospital, ordnance department hospital, police hospital and lock-hospital was burnt down in April. Since then the station staff hospital, cavalry detachment hospital, and ordnance department hospital are accommodated in a small hired bungalow in cantonments, which the Deputy Surgeon-General considers most unsuited to its purpose. The hospital assist- ant has also to live at a distance, and this arrangement is considered objection- able.

I would suggest that a trial should be made, in the native army, of a shoe of the native pattern, made rather high at the toe and heel, so as not to come off when running, Such a shoe is worn by the Bundelas, and would, I think, be found much more comfortable cheaper, and easier to put on and off than those now worn. It would also very considerably diminish the number of admissions into hospital, and would enable the troops to make long marches without being footsore, as the other natives of the country constantly do; and as sepoys can, when wearing native shoes.

IV. Climate. 160 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. Fevers. Accidents. Pthisis. Malarial fevers occasioned 50 per cent. of the total admissions, which is a high average for a healthy year. Mild quotidian fevers were so prevalent in June, July and August, as to give rise to apprehensions of a severe autumnal outbreak. The admissions from this cause, which were 41 in June, 31 in July, and 61 in August, fell to 26 in September and 25 in October. The decrease of fever was coincident with early and complete cessation of the rains in September. There is nothing specially interesting to record on any of the groups of disease from 2 to 5. One case included amongst the accidents seems to merit notice from the rarity of its causation. A fairly strong, wel-developed man, when at target practice, had the outer third of his right clavicle fractured from recoil of his rifle. Previous experience led me to suspect that the same cause might provoke even more serious lesions, and my suspicions are strengthened by the occurrence of this case. In 1873, a sturdy, well-built Goorkha came to hospital on completion of his musketry course with profuse hæmoptysis. Swelling and echymosis in vicinity of right shoulder testified to the nature of his recent employment, and there could be no doubt that the blood spat up issued from the apex of his right lung which was consolidated. The man recovered and is still in the regiment, his general health is now excellent, but good respiration has never become re-established in the apex of his right lung. Phthisis pulmonalis was not so prevalent in the past as it has been of late years. Five cases were admitted, three were invalided, and two died. I have freely availed myself of the facilities afforded by the neighbour- ing sanitarium, Thundiani, for testing the effects of residence in lofty altitudes on sufferers from phthisis. In the year under review, three cases so affected were kept at Thundiani, 9,000 feet high, during the greater part of the hot weather; one of them recovered, and is now at duty; the second was much relieved, and a vast improvement took place in his general health; and in the third, the disease was quite unaffected by change of climate. The man progressed from bad to worse, and long before the expiration of his leave, had to be brought back to cantonment, where he died shortly afterwards. The post-mortem examination in this case showed in addition to cavities miliary tuberculosis of both lungs. Causes of death. XVII. Principal causes of mortality.PUNJAB FRONTIER FORCE. 161 Information subsequently gleaned from various sources leads me to conclude that in the same period, between middle of July and beginning of October, small-pox was also present in the civil station in rear of cantonment, but carelessly kept registers do not show the extent of mortality to which it gave rise. With small-pox in the hamlets in front, the civil station behind, and probably in the villages all round, it is but rational to suppose that the disease gained access to cantonment through personal contagion, its ordinary channel of dissemination. The main facts of the outbreak do not favor the hypothesis of its propagation through the medium of milk. Had milk or any other article of diet in common use been the vehicle in which the small-pox poison was disseminated, it is impossible to conceive that the disease would have been restricted to the few seizures that actually occurred. From the 5th of October, the date of first seizure, up to the present time, fourteen cases of small-pox have occurred in can- tonment, and were distributed as follows:162 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL.

Detachments. Mr. Costello deduces the following conclusions regarding the meteorology of the year from a table in which observations for 1874 are contrasted with six preceding years. Meteorology. There has been nothing in the range of the barometer during the past year to distinguish it particularly from previous years. The height of the barometer was decidedly lower than in any of the preceding six years, probably caused by the very unusual rainfall (13.65 inches) of the past year. The mean temperature, the mean maximum temperature, and the lowest temperature were all lower in the past than in most of the previous years given in the table. This was also due to the greater rainfall. The greatest maximum temperature was lower than in 1872 and 1873, owing to the same cause. The mean daily range of temperature was above the average. The greatest daily range did not exceed the average for the last seven years. The mean dew-point was, not- withstanding the extraordinary rainfall, below the average; this was due to the great dryness of the last four months of the year, during which not a drop of rain fell. The mean strength of the wind (64.0 8 miles) was below the average. The direction of the wind differed from preceding years in having been from the north west instead of the north-east as heretofore. I think that this was caused by the unusual rainfall, as rain generally comes from the north-west. The rainfall ( 13.65 inches ) was very high for the Derajat. Rainfall. There has been a steady increase (although not clearly shown in this table) in the rainfall of the Derajat since we took the Punjab, due, I should say, to the greater cultivation and irrigation which came in with our rule. Probably, this greater rainfall will deprive in time Dera Ismail Khan of its reputation for healthiness. 8.30 inches fell in June, July, and August the remainder in January, February, March, and April. 4.42 inches fell in July alone, and 3.72 in August. So much rain falling in these latter months told heavily afterwards as regards " malarious " fever, as may be seen under Section XVI. The sanitary circumstances of the regiment have undergone no change, and supplies have been plentiful and duties light; nights in bed, 5.38 in 7. Sanitary cir- cumstances.

Relief movements. The stations of the three Assam regiments were changed during the year, viz., 42nd from Debrooghur to Gowhatty, 43rd from Gowhatty to Shillong, 44th Shillong to Debrooghur. As Gowhattyis no longer the head-quarters of the 43rd, the Assam stations formerly garri- soned by it were made over in the early part of the year to detachments of the 42nd regiment. These reliefs took place in the months of March and April. In September, when men were required for the Duffla Expedition and for the reserve at Gowhatty, the detachments at Sylhet, Chargola, and Allynugur were recalled. Changes in the station of Shillong.

The latter is well situated on a separate spur of the hill to leward of the other buildings. Hospital bed- ding. A good deal of attention is devoted to the cleanliness and sufficiency of the bedding of the sick. When it is seen to be manifestly insufficient, an extra blanket or two is obtained through the Native officer of the man's company from the regimental store. Visitors. The institution was visited on 22nd August by the Viceroy and the Chief Commissioner of Assam, and they both expressed themselves pleased with the building and the neatness and order of the arrangements.

A series of river fogs occur in the mornings at this station as at other stations on the banks of the Brahmaputra during months of October, November and December, ending during February and March. These are often limited to the region over the river, and in any case disappear there last. These are occasionally as dense as a true November London fog. Lines. V.

Water supply is drawn from pucca wells situated in the lines, and also for five months in the year from the river Dibroo, which runs in front of cantonments. The well water is of excellent potable quality, but insufficient for ablution purposes. During the few months the river is open there is abundance of water for all purposes. Food. XI .

All round the stockade the land is well cleared of jungle, but on the other bank of the river dense forest jungle comes down to the water's edge. The place is completely shut in by hills, consequently the current of air is almost at a standstill; dense fogs rise in the night (especially in the cold weather), and enveloping the whole place saturate everything with moisture. They rarely clear off before 10 or 11 A. M. Monierkhal Chargola is, I understand, a thickly populated district, the principal inhabitants being Munniporees. Rice is extensively grown there, and a large bazar is held once a week. Ally- nugur rather differs from it in these respects. Chargola. IV.

Of course, in the height of the rains, the earth is not quite dry, still it answers admirably even then. The soil from the band lines and the regimental bazar (there are no female latrines, and if there were, they wouldn't use them) is-likewise buried in these trenches. In the very worst weather there is no effluvium to speak of; on a hot day the "aqueduct" is sometimes a little offensive, but a little lime soon gets rid of this. I tried to get some per- chloride or persulphate of iron as an urinary deodorant, but didn't succeed. Of course both the structures above mentioned are moved as occasion requires. The above I understand was the system in force when the regiment was quartered at Meerut; for its introduction and estab- lishment here the chief credit is due to the station staff officer, who has been most indefatiga- ble in his exertions to ensure its success. The hospital latrine is in excellent order, having been thoroughly repaired in the early part of the year. The ordinary conservancy of the lines is in the hands of ther egimental sweepers; the rubbish, e. g., dead leaves, &c., &c., is collected into one place near the latrines and burnt when practicable. The whole cantonment has been kept in excellent order during the year. Water-supply. VIII. Water-supply .EASTERN FRONTIER DISTRICT. 199 Liebig's extract well covered with magnesia, egg flip, &c.

On post-mortem examination, the most complete specimen of fatty degeneration of the heart I have ever seen was discovered. I was unwise enough to put the heart in ordinary rum; it went bad in a week.

On a good wooden and bamboo framing grass sides and roof are placed. The sides are of the large reed like "nul" grass placed vertically and held in position by strips of bamboo. The roof is made of good thatching grass. The men lie on machans 2 feet high and 6 feet 6 inches broad, constructed of split bamboos. At the east end of the hospital 2 small rooms are partitioned off to be used for store rooms, dispensary, or for a medical subordinate. This hospital is placed to the north-east of the lines, and in an open maidan adjoining the parade-ground. A. grass cook-house is placed to the east of the hospital.

The cases, although numerous, have not been severe as a rule, and have given way to treatment in a gratifying manner. The influence of the Duffla Expedition on the health of the wing is not yet apparent. During the continuance of the expedition bowel complaints were the prevailing diseases. Deputy Surgeon-General J. T. C. Ross inspected on the 28th February 1875. There was only a small guard in the lines on the day of his visit. Owing to the lateness of the hour he could not inspect the hospital. He found fault with nothing connected with the lines, with the exception of the con- servancy, of which he writes:204 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. 38th Regiment Native InfantryEASTERN FRONTIER DISTRICT. 205 XVI.

The force now consisted of about 2,000 men, all told; all marched in single file, and in the open order required by the impediments and roughness of the track. and the density of the jungle on either hand. Allowing 4 feet from a man's rear heel to the rear heel of the man walking in front of him, the line would be 1½ mile long; it was probably longer, for the transport coolies with their loads would often cover more space. Head-quarters arrived in 3¼ hours229 APPENDIX230 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. A descent from the camp led to a narrow plateau between the hills and the Dikrung, along which the path ran for several miles. There were several stiff places to go over which there had not been time to improve, and after 3 hours' marching APPENDIX232 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REFORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. It had been blowing hard and cold all day with occasional showers: here on the northern side of the hill it was blowing an icy gale of wind from the northward, with occasional showers of sleet; there was not much shelter to be got; bamboos and thicker leaved jungle were doubtless below, but the men were wet and tired, and the country was unknown; the little waste wood to be found was sodden and. would not burn well; however, all hutted cheerfully with the best materials to hand.

The transport corps made its own arrangements for the carriage of its hospital equipment. A hospital tarpaulin was useful as giving quick shelter for the sick. Each was 12' x 14'. Pitched on a ridge pole of 12' gave a fall of 7' on either side, which, with ends and sides filled in with bush or grass, gave shelter for 10 men237 APPENDIX238 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL.

In the hot weather the vessel might be moored in the stream away from the bank. 13. Personal cleanliness should be looked after. Healthy men should bathe daily, unless it is against their habits; a safe place for bathing and washing should be provided. Clothes should be washed two or three times a week at least, or as often as practicable. It may be requisite even to stop the vessel an hour or two for this purpose. 14. Twelve superficial feet of space is allowed for each adult, exclusive of hospital space, gangways, hatches, decks opposite latrines, space for crew and attendants, &c. The men must be propery arranged at night, and all crowding and huddling together prevented. They should generally lie with their heads towards centre of vessel. There will, generally, be a free deck space between the lines of men of from eight to twelve feet, according to the breadth of the vessel. The ventilation at night should be attended to. Care should be taken that the men are sufficiently covered at night. Men might be exercised on deck during the day. Screens for hospital are better placed aft and on an upper deck, Hospital space is given for five per cent. of sick at 24 superficial feet per man. 15. It is directed that Flats are to have a canvas curtain for enclosing the deck space, hanging from roof to deck, with ventilating space under the eaves above, but fastening when down close to the deck below; a boarding one foot high rising from the plank-sheer of the vessel, and netting, or some defence, from plank to rail above. Lanterns should burn all night in the dispensary and near privies and gangways, and on the decks. 16. Accidents should be guarded against; the railings of all exposed places, such as the side of the vessel, near hatches, ladders, bathing places, latrines, communication and landing stages, &c., should be examined from time to time. The presence of life buoys should be ascertained. Men should not be allowed to draw water over the side of the vessel when it is in motion. 17. Latrines, with canvas screens in front, are fitted as far aft as possible: cabooses are placed as far forward of latrines as space will admit. These offices should be sufficient in number. Two tubs kept filled with water should be close to the latrines. 18. The drinking water should be carefully attended to. Two 400-gallon tanks with covers are generally on board: a constant supply should be kept up in them: they should be used alternately, allowing the water to settle after the addition of six grains of alum to the gallon. Water to fill the tanks while on the voyage should be taken as far forward as possible. Water is not, however, stored when that of the rivers is considered of good quality and clear. Good water should be used for cooking. Every effort should be made to prevent the men from drinking the river water fresh drawn from the side of the vessel, unless it is known to be good. If muddy water is drank, it acts as an irritant. 19. Food issued should be inspected from time to time, and any complaints attended to. Care must be exercised that the men do not over-eat themselves, or use food that they are unaccustomed to. The men in each vessel should be made as comfortable as circumstances admit; and care should be taken that the arrangements for food, cleanliness, &c., &c., are systematically carried out. There is on board a stock of medicines, hospital necessaries and comforts, bazar medicines, and disinfectants for the medical wants of the men during the probable duration of the voyage of fifteen days. 20. During any railway journey, it should be noted that each man is allowed four superficial feet of space, and that not more than sixty should be in each carriage. The men should not want for food; there should be a supply of good water; and a short stoppage should be arranged for at each station to permit men who require to get out to do so. J. T. C. R. D. E. No. 48, CALCUTTA, 12TH OCTOBER 1874. Memorandum to medical opens on sanitation of marches and camps, &c. 1. Attention should be given to all temporary encamping places; the features of the country must always determine their situation. The site of a standing camp should be high and dry, or at all events not liable to be flooded during rain; and it should be levelled as far as practicable. The general surface drainage should be attended to and improved if necessary. Proximity to the water-supply is desirable. Slopes of hills are good, provided they do not overlook swampy land; all proximity to swamps should be avoided. Marshy land is always dangerous, except when a sufficient belt of forest or brushwood intervenes. The bottoms of hills or gorges, or where two hill slopes trend, are objectionable. Plateaus but little elevated above undrained land are not desirable; the plain itself is better if it be dry. Open sites are generally the best in a malarious country, especially where surrounded by trees at a sufficient distance. Ground recently cleared of high reed or grass jungle is not generally safe to encamp on. The neighbourhood of high coarse grass jungle should be avoided. Jungle or long grass in the camp itself should be cleared away, unless a damp surface would be exposed. Brushwood in the vicinity should not be too much cleared unless it interferes with ventilation. 2. Cleanliness of camps or huts should be ensured by the passages being regularly swept; holes surrounded by a screen should be conveniently placed for urination; refuse collected morning and evening and burnt; it is better to select spots or receptacles for such collection. Places should be set apart for cooking purposes. The smoke from wood-fires is healthy in camp at night. 3. The water-supply requires particular care. In standing camps, if its character is doubtful, arrangements will be detailed for boiling, or for its rough filtration. If it is from
APPENDIX252 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. prevent the disease spreading to other communities, and try to limit it as far as possible to the affected men. Cholera medicines in sufficient quantity will be with every detachment. Excreta must be buried in pits at least three feet deep, and distinct from any source of water supply; all the known precautions concerning soiled clothes and vessels must be employed, and the disinfectants freely used about persons and places. All fatal cases should be buried deep. J. T. C. R.. APPENDIX F. No. 29 To the Officers in medical charge, 16th, 42nd, 43rd, 44th N. I., Transport Corps, and Depôts. I have the honor to give you the following instructions regarding requirements and regimental returns for the Duffla expedition. Should you not accompany the detachment from the regiment, a copy of this memo- randum should be given to the officer proceeding in charge. 2. The medical officer in charge of the detachment is recommended to keep a diary, in which the health of the men under his charge, and the various incidents of the expedition affecting it, may be accurately noted at the time. 3. A special report should be drawn up to the close of the expedition, from the notes thus systematically taken during the period the troops are on the service. These notes should detail topography, climate, duty, service, camps, food, water, clothing, shelter, conservancy, &c., and any incidents of the voyage or march from, or to, head-quarters. 4. This special report should be accompanied by a special return in the form of that detailed at page 320 of the medical and sanitary report of the native army of Bengal for 1872, in which the hospital statistics, sickness, mortality, and invaliding of the detachment should be shown. 5. The statistics and diseases of "followers" should be included in this return as far as practicable; they should be placed at the foot, after the treated in other hospitals; their average strength being noted and their daily average number of sick. 6. A new admission and discharge book, and medical certificate book, will be forwarded to you for use from the date of the detachment leaving head-quarters. On small detachments leaving the main body, an ms. form of the A and D book should be used to register all admis- sions, &c., until they can be embodied in the detachment book. 7. The following returns will be required from the detachments detailed for the ex- pedition:APPENDIXMEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL FOR THE YEAR 1874.
