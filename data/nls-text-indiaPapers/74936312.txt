There was a proportionate increase of 18 per cent in the number of specimens received and examined during the quarter (vide table V). This increase occurs chiefly under the headings " Widal's test " and " Wasserman tests." There has been a big fall in the number of specimens received for examination for malarial parasites. This is probably due to the fact that the examina- tion, being a simple one, has been carried out by the local Medical officers themselves. Table V.

These were issued on receipt of indents from that department. The plague inoculation class, started in 1918 under G.O. Mis. No. 285, Medical, dated 18th June 1918, was held three times during the quarter and 26 medical men attended the class.

The work carried out during the quarter is set forth in tables VI and VII. As the period is too short to permit of even one complete series of examinations of the Presidency water-supplies being carried out, no conclusions of value can be drawn and the tables are given without comment.

REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, GUINDY, FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1921-22. LIST OF CONTENTS. PAGE Introduction 56 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY Certain departments of the Institute, notably that connected with the public health, are still very much in embryo and call urgently for further development. A scheme of reorganization providing for extension in various directions is at present before Government. This scheme, if accepted, should add considerably to the future efficiency of the Institute. The work carried on in an Institute of this type is of interest from various points of view. In the first place, being partly a manufacturing concern, it is important to see how far the results of the year's working have met with success from the financial point of view. Scientific questions on the other hand appeal more to the investigator into medical problems. The present report has therefore been divided into the following sections each of which describes the activities of the Institute from a different point of view:REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 7 Statement 1 shows that the supplies to the various bodies have increased with the exception of the Military Department, District Boards and Municipalities. The District Boards have received 236,700 cases and Municipalities 3,410 cases less than the previous year. This decrease is undoubtedly due to the cessation of routine vaccination during the hot months sanctioned in Government Memo. No. 8121-P.H., dated 16th May 1921, and G.O. No. 860-P.H., dated 19th July 1921, and brought into effect for the first time during the present year. In previous years the monthly returns for primary vaccinations, which may be taken as a fair criterion of the amount of lymph issued, did not differ to any great extent. In the present year, however, the number of primary vaccinations recorded during May and June was almost negligible and those carried out in July and August were considerably below the average. The number of vaccina- tions carried out during the remaining months, although higher than those of previous years, did not compensate fully for the diminished returns received between May and August and a decrease in the total number of vaccinations recorded for the whole year has been the result. It is certain that the number of cases requiring vaccination was not less than that of previous years and there is thus a certain increase in the unvaccinated population. This state of affairs should be remedied by intensifying the vaccina- tion campaign during the winter months rather than by a return to hot weather vaccination, for it will be shown in a subsequent section that the cessation of vaccination in the hot weather has had a beneficial effect on the success rates. The usual tri-monthly supplies of lymph have been made to the whole Presi- dency with the exception of the Agency vaccinators of Vizagapatam and G8 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY The receipts on the bacteriological side are derived from two sources (1) The supplies of bacterial vaccines. (2) The estimated value of the various examinations for Government and other bodies. It might be argued that pathological examinations have no real commercial value and should not therefore be included in a statement of this sort. All private institutions which carry on this type of work, however, have a regular tariff of charges for such examinations and the income they derive from this source is often very considerable. The King Institute can therefore legitimately include such examinations amongst the sources of its income. The value of the various examinations and supplies have been estimated at the sanctioned Government rates. The estimated expenditure of the Vaccine section for the year is Rs. 71,520 and for the Bacteriological section Rs. 1,28,684 giving a total of Rs. 2,00,204. Against this the value of the vaccine lymph issued has been estimated at. Rs. 1,14,375; bacteriological examinations, etc., have been valued at Rs. 1,72,513 and the estimated cost of the bacterial vaccines supplied is Rs. 23,596. These figures give a total of Rs. 1,96,109 for the Microbiological section and Rs. 3,10,484 as the receipts for the Institute as a whole. The Vaccine section has thus made a profit of Rs. 42,855, and the Microbiological section a profit of Rs. 67,425 on the year's working. The two figures combined give a gross profit of Rs. 1,10,280 for the whole Institute. This result cannot be considered other than very satisfactory. No credit has been allowed in this estimate for any research work which has been undertaken during the year. Such work, although impossible to value in terms of rupees, is still of very great value to the Presidency at large. III.9 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY This step has been of the greatest service. It has placed within easy reach an area in which the various types of lymph can be tested under perfect experi- mental conditions, these conditions at the same time conforming to those found in the districts. No less than 1,878 children were vaccinated during the year in this range under the direct supervision of the Institute staff. All of these cases were verified by the King Institute staff themselves and the majority by the Director or the Assistant Director in person. First hand knowledge of the behaviour of the different types of lymph under different conditions has thus been available to an extent not previously obtainable, and the satisfactory termination of the investigation already referred to was in great measure due to the work done in this range. It is to be hoped that this arrangement will continue permanently. It would indeed be a great step forward if the Saidapet range were definitely established as a model vaccination range where the effect of all measures taken to improve vaccination could be tested before they were introduced into general use. (2) The testing of the results obtained by mufassal vaccinators by a Deputy Inspector of Vaccination sent from the King Institute. This scheme was suggested in the annual report for 192010 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY About 50 per cent of the total cases vaccinated in the Saidapet range were vaccinated with glycerine lymph. The collected figures from these various sources have given a large number of vaccinations with this type of lymph the results of which have been available for comparison with the routine lanoline vaccinations obtained from the whole Presidency. The glycerine lymph was not submitted to any purifying process such as chloroforming but was kept, until used, in the cold store. The special report was based on an analysis of 629,382 cases. The total number of returns for primary and secondary vaccinations for the year, however, was 1,084,352. In the present report the statements (III and IV) and the charts based on them (charts I and II) have been prepared from these later figures. The results obtained with lanoline and glycerine lymphs are given separately but also combined. It is satisfactory to note that the over-all success rate for the Presidency is 17.9 per cent better than that of the previous year and 2 per cent better than the rate obtained in 1918-19. The success rate obtained with lanoline vaccine alone was 77.64 and with glycerine vaccine alone 90.31. These results, obtained with nearly double the number of cases, simply confirm the conclusions already given in the special report that glycerine vaccine gives superior results to lanoline vaccine under the conditions found in the Madras Presidency. The monthwar-success rate (chart I and statement III) is of considerable interest for two reasons: CHART I Showing the Monthwar Success Rate for Lanoline and Glycerine Vaccine Lymph for the year 1921-22 issued from the King Institute and the Lanoline Lymph Success Rate for 1920-21.

REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 11 1921-22 showed a decrease of 44,946 over those of 1920-21. The net effect, there- fore, of the cessation of hot weather vaccination in 1921-22 was that 144,475 cases (189,42112 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY It is of interest to note that a satisfactory success rate is far more wide spread with glycerine lymph than with lanoline. No less than 14 districts out of 25 have recorded a success rate of over 90 per cent. The Madras Corporation heads the list with a success rate of 95.19 per cent. In the mufassal, as far as the glycerine lymph is concerned the Nilgiris (91.61 per cent) no longer heads the list, Chingleput (92.39 per cent), South Arcot (93.12 per cent), Kistna (92.23 per cent), North Arcot (94.68 per cent), Chittoor (94.04 per cent), Madura (94.06 per cent), Tanjore (93.95 per cent) and RREPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 13 which have stopped for four months. These figures as far as they go, point to the fact that a general four months' cessation would be more beneficial to the vaccina- tion rates than the shorter two months' period at present in vogue in certain districts. Estimation of vaccination rates. Experience gained during the year has lead to the belief that the present standard of judging the measure of success obtained in vaccine operations is not strict enough. Up to the present the official returns have only taken account of the success rate. The insertion success rate has not been recorded. This latter rate, however, is also essential if a true estimate of the value of a lymph is to be made. Arrangements are being made with the Director of Public Health for the issue of a revised form upon which vaccination returns will, in future, be made. This form has been drawn up in such a way that primary, secondary and revaccinations can all be recorded separately, the success rate and insertion success rate being recorded for all three types of vaccination. It is to be hoped that much more exact information will be the result of this innovation. Another point which has a most important bearing upon this subject has to do with the vaccination staff of the Presidency at large. The success rates obtained with lanoline lymph by the King Institute staff in the Saidapet range have been shown to be considerably lower than those given by the Presidency vaccinators with the same lymph. This can only mean that the standard for a successful vaccination adopted by the vaccination staff is lower than that of the King Institute. The majority of cases in the districts are veri- fied sometime after vaccination. It is probable therefore that very small and doubtful scars have been taken as evidence of successful vaccination. This is a point of very considerable importance. It has been shown that there is a correla- tion between the size of the scar area and the immunity conferred by vaccination. All cases such as those referred to above although registered as successful vaccinations are in reality inefficiently protected or not protected at all. There is thus a danger of their being infected if an epidemic should occur. When many cases of this type are present a position of affairs may arise where smallpox may be prevalent in an apparently well vaccinated community with a high incidence amongst the vaccinated. Such a position is very undesirable for it brings discredit upon vaccination and disturbs the public confidence in this well proved measure of protection. All vaccination operations have, as their ultimate aim, the protection of the community against smallpox. The only measure of this protection is the number of individuals who have been efficiently vaccinated. It is therefore of vital importance that the vaccination returns should be accurate for it is by this means alone that the extent to which the community is protected against smallpox can be measured. The most reliable method of judging the success of a vaccination is to inspect the case while the vesicle is still present. The efficiency of the Presidency vaccination operations could therefore best be tested if the Deputy Inspectors of Vaccination made a point of seeing as many of their cases as possible at this stage. Yield of pulp. Statement V shows the monthly average yield of pulp per calf for the year. It is satisfactory to note that there has been a further considerable increase in the yield, the average for the year being 20.2 grammes as against 14.6 grammes for the year 192014 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY B.REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 15 been examined in these cases prior to their blood being sent to the Institute for the agglutination test. It would appear therefore that the percentage of cases of "pyrexia" of uncertain origin is comparatively high in the Madras Presidency and that these cases require further investigation. The number of sera examined for the Wasserman reaction reached 2,966. The increasing demand for this test calls for the services of a special worker whose whole time will be devoted to serological tests. Three other diseases call for special mention. No less than 61 specimens have been received during the year for the diagnosis of diphtheria. These were derived from 34 suspected cases of the disease. One swab was sent from Trichinopoly, the remaining 33 came from Madras City and St. Thomas' Mount. Twenty-two cases came from Europeans, seven of these yielded the diphtheria bacillus in culture. Nine came from Indians. Four of these gave positive results. The remaining three cases whose exact source was unknown were negative. A definite outbreak of the disease amongst the European soldiers at the Mount was responsible for a large proportion of the European cases. Twenty-three examinations on seven men were carried out in this way. Four cases were shown to harbour the diphtheria bacillus. In one case six cultures and one smear, taken at various periods, gave positive results on three occasions. Two other cases were examined five times and four times, respectively. The diphtheria bacillus was found once in each case. It is of interest to note that on six occasions a smear from the throat was the only specimen forwarded on the first occasion. All the smears yielded negative results. Cultures, which revealed the presence of diphtheria bacillus in each case, were subsequently obtained from three of these cases. This observation shows the great importance of obtaining a culture in cases of suspected diphtheria as early as possible. Thirty-one specimens of cerebrospinal fluid taken from twenty-two cases with meningeal symptoms have been received for examination. The meningococcus of Weischelbaum was found on culture in five of these. A pneumococcus was present in four cases and tubercle bacilli in one. Twelve cases gave negative results. The meningococci were tested with Mervyn Gordon's type sera in each case and were found to belong to his type I. One of the pneumococci typed with serum supplied by the Rockefeller Institute, belonged to type I. Of the 23 cases 7 were examined on more than one occasion. Pneumococci were found on the first examination in each of the four cases in which this organism was found. It was otherwise with the meningococcus. On one occasion only, was this organism present in culture on the first examination. It was found in three cases on the second examination and once post-mortem only It would appear that meningococci take a longer time than pneumococci to multiply in the cerebrospinal fluid to a sufficient extent to make them apparent by cultural methods. It is important therefore that repeated examinations should be made in every case when a positive result has not been obtained in the first instance. Three cases were examined for suspected anthrax. One of these is well worth recording. The patient was a European belonging to a British Regiment which came to Madras in connexion with the visit of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. He was admitted to Hospital with a typical malignant pustule just below his jaw. This was removed by operation. Cultures taken from the pustule before operation and sections of the pustule itself revealed numerous anthrax bacilli. Blood cultures from the general circulation remained sterile. The position of the pustule indicated that the patient had become infected through shaving. The shaving brush was obtained but showed no marks whereby its origin could be detected. Inquiry showed that it had been bought in the Secunderabad bazaar. Cultures made from the bristles gave an abundant growth of typical and virulent anthrax bacilli. The complete chain of evidence as to the source of infection was thus completed. The patient was treated with Sclavo's anti-anthrax serum and ultimately recovered.
16 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY Anti-toxic sera. The Institute continued its role as the purchasing, storing and distributing agency for anti-toxic sera for the Madras Presidency. The demand for these sera is increasing rapidly. Statement IX shows that the supplies made from the Institute during the year under report have been more than doubled during the past two years. (2,664 bottles in 1921 as opposed to 1,261 bottles in 1919.) This increase has undoubtedly been aided by the modification in the financial adjustment introduced by G.O. Mis. No. 1259 L., dated 1st October 1918. Previous to this the Institute obtained stocks of sera on credit from firms in England. The bills for these were paid by recouping the cost from the various, Government Institutions to whom the serum was supplied. By the new arrange- ment the King Institute purchases the serum from a fixed sum allotted in the Institute budget. Government Institutions are supplied free and private bodies are charged cost price. No objection is taken to this procedure, which has the merit of simplicity, so long as the grant is sufficient to purchase all the serum required for the Presidency and other heads of the Institute budget are not drawn upon for this purpose. C.REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 17 The water supplies to the three hill stations, derived from lakes and reservoirs have as usual yielded satisfactory results. The supplies from wells and springs have been very variable. Jails. With the possible exception of Tanjore Jail the remainder, nine in number, have been, as usual, very unsatisfactory. The need for systematic sterilization by chemicals or boiling has been apparent in the case of every one of these supplies. Salem, Berhampore, Vellore and Tanjore have a possible alternative. At all these places a municipal supply exists which is better than that of the jail. These jails could thus improve their position considerably if they took advantage of the municipal supply. Railway stations. The water supplies of the stations on the Madras and Southern Mahratta system which have been examined are now with few exceptions in a satisfactory condition. Those on the South Indian Railway are not so good. Of the three stations on the Bengal-Nagpur Railway the supply to Naupada, in spite of the improvements suggested and carried out, is still far below the standard required for safety. The possibility of a fresh source of supply should therefore be considered. The Railway authorities have, as a rule, evinced the greatest interest in the water supplies of their stations and have been anxious to take the steps suggested by this Institute for the improvement of their supplies. A summary of the results of the examinations of the individual water supplies will be found in Appendix I. IV.18 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY a week of the Director's visit. The staff consisted of Military Assistant Surgeon. Theodore, then on special duty at the King Institute, in charge together with one of the Institute laboratory attendants. The laboratory worked under the immediate supervision of the Director and was regarded as an offshoot of the King Institute, all the necessary stores, media and apparatus being supplied as required from the Institute. At the termination of the year under report there had already been a very definite improvement in the health of the jail although the laboratory had only been at work for a very short time. 4. The water supplies of the different jails were also periodically examined at the Institute and advice given as to their improvement. 5. Assistance has also been rendered to the Medical Store-Keeper on several occasions. Nine field dressings have been examined for sterility and samples of chlorinated lime made by the department have been tested for the chlorine content. The disinfecting properties of some samples of brominated lime which had been made at the stores, were also tested. The results of these tests were embodied in a paper by Captain McCullock, I.M.D., which will be published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research. 6. Various sera and perishable medical supplies have been as usual stored in the cold store for the Veterinary Department. The care and issue of these articles falls entirely upon the packing department of the Institute. 7. 7.50 litres of 10 per cent bleach solution, containing from 15 to 20 per cent of available chlorine, have been made up at the Institute and issued to the Sanitary Department for anti-cholera work at KumbakREPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 19 (3) Dr. C. A. Venugopal of the Tuberculosis Institute for three weeks. (4) Sub-Assistant Surgeon Visvanatha Ayyar of the Royapettah Hospital for about three months. 6. Two lectures of an educational nature were delivered by the Director of the Institute during the course of the year. The first, given to the Medical College Association, was entitled "snakes and snake bite." The second, to the Presidency College Natural History Association, was on " Micro-organisms and their relationship to disease "; both lectures were illustrated with lantern slides. 7. The following Medical pamphlets were written for the Publicity Board by Major J. A. Cruickshank, I.M.S., Assistant Director. (1) Elephantiasis. (2) Smallpox and vaccination.

THE INAPPLICABILITY OF THE MILLS-REINCKE PHENOMENON TO INDIAN CONDITIONS By Mr. T. N. S. RAGHAVACHARI, B.A. (From the King Institute of Preventive Medicine, Guindy). The applicability of the Mills-Reincke phenomenon to the vital statistics of any town with a protected water-supply depends upon four essential conditions:Government [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of 74936452.tif]of Madras LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT (PUBLIC HEALTH) DEPARTMENT G.O. No. 154-P.H., 29th January 1923 Report2 No. 154-P.H., 29TH JANUARY 1923 would have to be purchased at whatever price the manufacturers might demand, and for bacteriological and other clinical examinations any private institution would have its regular tariff of charges. The Government recognize the economic value of the Institute, and have under consideration the annual preparation of a pro forma account of its working. 6. The comparative merits of lanoline and glycerine lymph have been discussed in detail in a separate report, disposed of by Government in G.O. No, 1421-P.H., dated 16th October 1922. Incidental to that investigation, Major Cunningham touches on certain important innovations in method, among them being (a) the utilization of the Saidapet Vaccination Range for testing lymph, (b) the intensive testing of the results in mufassal and (c) Dr. Nejland's method of increasing the potency of seed lymph by passing it through three vaccinifers in rotation. The Director's proposal to establish a Saidapet range appears feasible, and should be made the subject of a separate reference. 7. Major Cunningham then discusses certain facts brought to light by an exhaustive examination of the success rate month by month, an examination which affords useful data in appraising the relative qualities of lanoline and glycerine lymph and the effect of discontinuing vaccination during the hot weather. In this connexion it is interesting to note that the demand in various towns and districts for vaccine lymph during the hot weather might be used as an index to the local prevalence of smallpox. 8. In examining the success rates, Major Cunningham brings to light two important facts:No. 154-P.H., 29TH JANUARY 1923 3 12. The Government agree that the present system of utilizing the Institute for the purchase of store and distribution of anti-toxic sera may continue, provided that the receipts and charges therefor are shown separately from the accounts of the Institute. It is an index to progress that in medical relief the demand for such sera has more than doubled during the past two years. 13. The urgent need for the establishment of standards of purity for food stuffs is fully recognized by the Government, and proposals are under consideration for the appointment of a public analyst and the equipment of a laboratory in order that the Food Adulteration Act may no longer remain a dead letter. 14. The vexed question of water purification is engaging the attention of a special Filtration Committee. The subject has not till recently received the attention it deserves. It is greatly complicated by variations in the types of water found in different localities, each of which is itself subject to seasonal change. The Government hope that steps are being taken to ensure a closer contact between the Sanitary Engineer and the Bacteriological Experts. Much valuable information has been gained, but it is unlikely that municipal water-supplies will be satisfactory unless and until the municipalities can supply skilled supervision of the working of their filters, aided perhaps by an inspectorate under the direct control of the Director of the King Institute or the Sanitary Engineer. Such an inspectorate would be invaluable in improving the quality of water-supply in jails, which at present is extremely unsatisfactory, and also, subject to the concurrence of the railway authorities, the water-supply of principal railway stations. 15. The Government are glad to note the useful services rendered by the Institute on the occasion of the visit of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and also to the Madras Corporation in connexion with the chlorination and rapid filtration at Kilpauk Filters, to the Jail department on the outbreak of disease in the Mappilla camps, to the Medical Stores and to the Veterinary department.

ScientificREPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, GUINDY, FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 19222 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY have been created on the Institute staff. A suitable number of laboratory atten- dants and Assistant Overseers have also been appointed, the latter instead of the former shed-keeper's grade which has been abolished. By means of these changes much closer co-operation between the bacterio- logical and vaccine sections has been assured. The laboratory attendants throughout the Institute are now divided into three grades with promotion from one grade to the next as the reward of merit. The administrative advantages of the present system over the old one where individuals were appointed to serve in special posts are obvious. One further innovation of considerable importance requires mention. Refer- ence was made in my last year's report to the detachment of a small bacteriological laboratory to assist in the measures taken to diminish the morbidity in the Moplah prisoners' camp at Bellary. The success which attended this measure caused me to formulate a scheme for the formation of permanent units, to be known as "investigation units," which should be attached to the King Institute and which should be utilized for the investigation of the causation of outbreaks of disease throughout the Presidency. The original scheme forwarded in my letter No. 5422REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 3 conditions under which vaccinations are carried out in the Presidency. Another point, however, requires serious consideration. An increased demand for lymph can only be considered satisfactory when accompanied by a similar rise in the returns for vaccinations performed, for it is only under these conditions that the increase can be taken as an indication of an improvement in the vaccinal state of the population in the Presidency. Unfortunately no proportional rise of this nature has been recorded. Last year it was pointed out that the fate of 40.7 per cent of the lymph issued was unknown. This figure was calculated on returns for primary vaccinations alone as the number of secondary and re-vaccinations had not been estimated. In the year under report, however, a more detailed system of recording has been introduced and it has been possible to make a complete calculation of the returns for the various types of vaccination. The results are given in the following table:4 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY districts show a shortage of over 30 per cent and in the case of Coimbatore, Gunt5 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY IV.6 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY Primary vaccinations.REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 7 glycerine lymph in a cool climate. The best all round results are those obtained by the Madras Corporation who in addition to a case success rate of 96.3 per cent have also recorded an insertion success rate of 88.9. The order of priority of the districts does not differ materially from that of the previous year. The majority of the districts who returned bad results last year have done so again this year. No definite reason such as higher temperature or length of time before receipt of vaccine from the Institute can be assigned for the bad results received from these districts. One is forced to the conclusion therefore that there is a consider- able difference in the amount of skill and care displayed by the vaccination staff belonging to different districts. Now that the vaccination operations have been placed under the supervision of the new Health Officers who have themselves received a special training in vaccination, it is to be hoped that those officers who have been appointed to the bad districts will do their best to remove this slur upon the district public health administration. Revaccinations.8 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY These figures simply corroborate the results obtained in previous investiga- tions on this subjects. (2) Experiments as to the feasibility of purifying glycerinated lymph by the chloroform process. REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 9 doses issued in 1921-22 (statements 11 and 12). The increase in the total quantity issued is due to the larger demand for prophylactic cholera and T.A.B. vaccines. This increase amounted to over 9,000 doses in the case of the former and 6,000 doses in the case of the latter vaccine. This evidence of the growing popularity of prophylactic inoculation as a preventive measure against these two epidemic diseases is a very promising feature of the public health administration and should be given every encouragement. The further subsidence of the influenza epidemic was responsible for a diminution in the demands for anti-influenza vaccine. Anti-meningococcus vaccine was prepared and issued for the first time during the year under report in response to a demand from the Jail department. 7,450 doses of this particular vaccine were issued. The small number of cases of cere- brospinal meningitis which occurred after its administration, however, prevented any conclusions as to its efficacy being drawn although careful preparations for such a test had been made. 1,742 doses of autogenous vaccine (for 260 cases) were issued during the year under report. The different types of these vaccines prepared will be found in statement 12. Results of treatment were reported in 78 cases or 30 per cent of the total number treated. There has thus been a considerable increase in the number of reports received over last year10 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY the fact that the majority of the stools were derived from healthy individuals and. were examined at the instance of the Jail department to see if they were "carriers." The examination of the stools as a diagnostic measure is not sufficiently practiced in this Presidency. Seventy-one specimens were examined for the presence of dysentery bacilli. Specific organisms were found in 20 of these, Shiga's baccillus was present in 7, one or other of the Flexner types in 12 and Morgan's bacillus in 1. The number of Wasserman reactions performed this year was 3,361 (395 more than last year). This test is now performed three times a week and occupies the time of a special worker. A special feature of the year has been the large number of specimens received for the diagnosis of relapsing fever. In previous years only one or two specimens were received and in each case a definite history of importation from an infected. area could be traced. The present year has seen a widespread epidemic in the Madras Presidency itself which has been reflected by the large number of speci- mens for diagnosis received at the Institute. Blood smears showing the presence of spirochaetes were sent from the following places:REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 11 purpose. No steps in this direction have yet been taken. It is to be hoped that the necessary orders for this purpose will be issued soon, so that no obstacles to the purchase of the requisite amount of serum will arise for want of adequate funds. (iii) PUBLIC HEALTH SECTION. One hundred and fifty specimens of a public health nature, excluding water, were examined during the year. Details of these are given in statement No.15. This number represents an increase of about 100 samples over the corresponding figures for the previous year. The varied nature of the specimens examined would indicate that the Institute is now capable of dealing with the routine analytical work of a Public Health laboratory. The number of specimens dealt with by this section is still ridiculously small. This is due in great part to the absence of satisfactory standards of purity for the various articles of food in the Madras Presidency. When the Public Health Analyst is appointed and takes charge of the section this work will be taken in hand and a great increase in this type of work will then be expected. The number of samples of water examined during the year was 2,468. This represents an increase of over 100 per cent over the samples tested in the previous year (see statement No.16). The major portion of this work has been done on behalf of the Madras Corporation. One thousand four hundred and eleven samples were examined chemically and bacteriologically. The total number of chemical examinations was 1,864 and bacteriological 2,015. The half-yearly routine examinations from Municipalities, Jails and railway stations provided 451 samples. Two hundred and eighty-two samples were derived from the Institute experimental filters. The work done for the Madras Corporation during the period of the emergency, i.e., between September 1922 and December 1922 and the samples that were examined in connexion with the experiments at the Kilpauk experimental installation accounted for 1,735 examinations. A special report on the Madras water-supply based on the examination of these samples and on a review of the analytical data available from examinations of the Madras water carried out between 1908 and 1923 was in process of preparation at the termination of the year under report.

R12 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY. the correct dose has been calculated for all the seasonal variations which are bound to occur in the raw water. The attention of those responsible for these two installations should be drawn to this most elementary principle of mechanical filtration. The KodaikREPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 13 and staff were thus reduced to a minimum, increased mobility was ensured and the efforts of the workers could be wholly concentrated upon the investigation on hand. As a proof of the mobility of these units it need only be mentioned that in each case they were ready to move off from the Institute with all the apparatus and stores necessary for their investigation within 24 hours of receipt of orders. On arrival at their destination one day was sufficient for them to open up the laboratory and commence work. The measure of success which has attended the various investigations carried out by these units can best be judged by a survey of the work which has been done by them and by the number of demands which have been made for their services. The only unit sanctioned was employed throughout the year first in the Ali- puram Jail for the Mappilla prisoners and then in the Central Jail, Cannanore. Other demands for assistance were so insistent, however, that other units made up of members of the Institute staff had to be despatched on several occasions. At these times the remainder of the Institute staff worked short-handed. The following units were sent out from the Institute during the year under report:14 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY Director while it was stationed at Bellary.

The investigation of the relapsing fever epidemic at Tanjore.REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 15 5. The formation of a clearing bacteriological laboratory at Cannanore Central Jail.16 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY The whole of the analytical work connected with the Committee's experiments on water purification is carried out in the Public Health Section of the Institute and the cost of these falls on the Institute budget. The extraordinary increase in the volume of work done by the Institute staff on behalf of the Committee has already been noted. If this work continues to increase, special provision will have to be made in the budget to cover the cost of these experiments. The energies of the Committee have been chiefly directed during the present year towards the solution of problems connected with the Madras water-supply. A full report on this subject was forwarded to Government with letter R.C. No. 577-467/B, dated the 29th April 1923. In addition to this work the experi- ments on the use of sand filters for rapid and semi-rapid filtration as a preliminary to chemical treatment were brought to a conclusion. As no report on these experiments has yet been forwarded to Government, this report is included in the present annual report as Appendix VII. Other minor experiments on the value of intermittent as opposed to continuous filtration with sand filters and the value of a preliminary matting of filters with alum, carried out with the experimental filter installation at the Institute, are also described. A definite programme of experimentation which is being followed has been drawn up by the Committee. This programme shows a long list of experiments still to be undertaken. During the year the Committee has formulated a scheme for a travelling inspectorate to pay periodical visits to the various water works in the Presidency. This inspectorate will consist of both Engineering and analytical units, the former working under the Sanitary Engineer and the latter being based on the Public Health section of the King Institute. It is intended that the Inspectorate should work much in the same way as the Institute investigation units already described. It will be mobile and will travel light, all supplies of media and chemicals will be prepared and forwarded from the King Institute. In this way the travelling staff and apparatus will be cut down to a minimum. This scheme with a full estimate of costs was forwarded in letter R.C. No. 577-237/B., dated 10th March 1922. Estimates for experiments on sewage suggested by Government in G.O. No. 15152-1, P.H., dated 8th August 1922 have also been prepared and forwarded in letter R.C. No. 577-315, dated 8th November 1922. V.REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 17 3. Seed vaccine lymph was supplied to Ceylon and Coorg during the year and the French Settlements in Southern India received their supply of vaccine lymph from the Institute. 4. Various sera and perishable medical supplies were as usual stored in the cold room on behalf of the Veterinary Department. The institute also undertook the packing and issue of these stores as required. 5. At the instance of the Public Health Board, of which the Director is a member, a Committee consisting of the Director of Public Health and the Director, King Institute, Guindy, was requested to report on the value of stabilised bleach solution for the sterilization of water-supplies. The tests for this report were carried out in the Public Health section of the Institute. As the results are very striking the report which was forwarded with my letter R.C. No. 5017-12/B., dated the 22nd May 1923, is given as Appendix IX. The main conclusions drawn from the experiments were:18 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 2. Eighteen students of the second-class Health Officers and B.S.Sc. classes attended a course in the process of vaccine lymph manufacture. The course lasted for one week in December 1922. All performed their duties satisfactorily. 3. Seventeen students of the same class also attended a month's course in the diagnosis and prevention of malaria which was held at the Institute between 1st February 1923 and 2nd March 1923 in accordance with G.O. Mis. No. 394- P.H., dated 11th March 1922. An examination was held at the end of the course at which all the candidates were successful. 4. The plague inoculation class originated in 1918 under G.O. No. 285, Medi- cal, dated 18th June 1918, was held monthly throughout the year. Ninety-nine Medical Officers attended this class. 5. At the request of the Lady Superintendent of the Caste and Gosha Hos- pital, a demonstration in the technique of the Wassermann re-action and the bacteriological diagnosis of venereal diseases was given to the lady students by the Director of the Institute. 6. The following medical men worked in the King Institute and received training in bacteriological methods:19 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 1. The experiments in connexion with vaccine lymph has been described in the section dealing with this subject. 2. The reports on semi-rapid filtration with sand filters (Appendix VII) and on stabilised bleach (Appendix IX) have already been mentioned. 3. The investigations carried out by the various investigation units have also been referred to (pages 12 to 15 and Appendices II to VI). 4. The epidemic of relapsing fever offered a favourable opportunity for the study of the results of infection in the lower animals with spironema carteri. These experiments have been carried out by the Director and the Assistant Director throughout the year and are still in progress. 5. The investigation of the organisms in faeces, water and other situations with a view to increasing our knowledge as to the significance of their presence in water has been continued during the year. 6. The King Institute was represented at the tenth meeting of the Indian Science Congress held at Lucknow in January 1923.

Cuddalore District Jail.30 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY APPENDIX No. II. REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE CAMP LABORATORY, ALIPURAM JAIL, BELLARY, BY J. H. THEODORE, I.M.D., Military Assistant Surgeon. Under orders from the Director of the Institute, I proceeded in charge of a camp laboratory to Bellary on 28th March 1922, taking with me the necessary laboratory equip- ment and one laboratory attendant. Owing to the abnormally high sick rate prevailing at the Moplah Camp Jail, the Director of the Institute had proceeded, a few days previously, to inspect the jail. On viewing the situation he decided to send out a camp laboratory. The following diseases were prevalent at the time of the Director's inspection, viz., Dysentery, Chicken-pox, Cerebro-spinal fever and the Enteric group of fevers. These were assuming epidemic form. I received detailed instructions from the Director as to the nature of the bacteriological examinations to be carried out and the sanitary methods to be adopted in controlling the epidemics. The camp laboratory left the King Institute within 24 hours notice reaching Bellary the following morning. The laboratory was accommodated in rooms selected by the Director in the Moplah Jail Hospital. The camp laboratory remained at Bellary for six months. It was inspected during this period by the Director and the Assistant Director of the Institute who entirely directed its working. The Laboratory was run on the principle that it was an off-shoot of the King Institute. Media, Stains, etc., were made up at the Institute and sent in convenient bulk to the laboratory, as they were required. This procedure obviated the necessity for opening a separate bacteriological kitchen at Bellary, and thus reduced the staff and equipment to a minimum. The arrangement was found to work well and little or no inconvenience was encountered on this score. The camp laboratory, in certain cases could undertake only the preliminary examinations of specimens. These were then sent up to the Institute for further detailed examination. The number of specimens examined at the laboratory totalled 4,043 for the six months; in addition 61,080 specimens of excreta from 5,090 convicts were examined microscopically. with a view to the detection of latent dysentery cases. Dysentery. Bowel complaints had shown an alarming tendency to increase since the beginning of January. There were 385 cases in hospital, out of a total jail population of 4,400 on the day on which the camp laboratory commenced to work. The programme of work in connexion with this disease, as detailed by the Director, was based on his original work in the Bengal jail. This consisted in the first place of a repeated examination for 12 consecutive days of the stools of the entire jail population. The object of the investigation was to detect convicts suffering from latent dysentery, who were themselves swelling the number of cases in hospital, and were the potential agents for spreading the disease, amongst the non-infected population. By this means the whole jail population was ultimately divided into two main groups, viz.REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 31 These men were constituted into a " Bowel gang " housed separately; dieted and treated for their conditions. They were given suitable work in their own enclosure, and were not allowed to mix with the rest of the convicts. Having completed the division of the convicts already in the jail, into these two classes of normals and abnormals, a control was then kept on all fresh admissions into the jail, and the necessary examinations were done on various batches admitted, during the period of their routine quarantine. Only those proved to be normal were admitted into the general jail population all latent dysentery cases were admitted directly into the " Bowel gang " for further observation and treatment. An interesting feature revealed during these observations is one which the Director drew attention to, in his investigation in Bengal, viz., that a higher proportion of abnormals were detected from amongst the more recent arrivals into the jail, when compared with the groups who had been in jail for some time. This separation of the normal from the abnormal population brought the following points into undisputed prominence:32 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY Cerebro-spinal fever. An epidemic of cerebro-spinal fever had occurred previous to the Director's visit.

The entire jail was accordingly treated for the disease; a factor which contributed very materially to the improvement of the health of the convicts. Examination of convalescents and men employed in the preparation and distribution of food formed an important factor in controlling the spread of diseases where this depended upon food and drink for their spread. This examination was undertaken by the laboratory. A permanent kitchen staff of healthy convicts was thus established. At the request of the Inspector General of Prisons a training in simple laboratory methods was accorded to the medical staff of the jail.

REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE INVESTIGATION UNIT SENT TO INVESTIGATE RELAPSING FEVER IN THE TANJORE DISTRICT, BY CIVIL ASSISTANT SURGEONS RAMAKRISHNAN. Under instruction from the Director I proceeded to Tanjore with a Laboratory Attender and the equipment necessary for a camp laboratory on the 10th April 1922. The next morning, I met the District Medical and Sanitary Officer who gave the names of a few of the infected villages in the district. Captain Ubhaya, the Assistant Director of Public Health, also arrived at Tanjore on the 11th and we inspected a group of these villages every day. A full and detailed investigation was rendered impossible, as the epidemic was already dying out when we started our investigation. No data were available to make general clinical observations except such information as we could obtain from the examining of very few cases which we saw lingering, or from those fewer still, who were recently attacked. The history of the spread of the epidemic cannot be trustworthy as the information bearing on the same could be gathered only from hearsay evidence, and that too given at a period so remote from the beginning of the outbreak. Facts and figures available are summarised in the following pages and some general observations are made permissible under the circumstances. Origin and spread of the epidemic. During our investigations at Tirukattupalli, a village near the south-western corner of Tanjore taluk, about 3 miles from the river Coleroon, we were able to ascertain from the villagers that cases of fever in epidemic form were noticed early in September 1921, and that these cases occurred as a result of infection contracted from certain villages in Lalgudi taluk, Trichinopoly district, just on the other side of the Coleroon River. From an examination of the death registers of the various villages inspected, and also from the information given by the villagers themselves, we were able to form a general idea of the spread of the epidemic. The epidemic spread in a north-easterly direction through successive villages along the Coleroon bank from the taluks, Tanjore, PREPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 35 cheri consists of one or more rows of huts not worth the name of streets. The huts are thatched, low, ill-ventilated, badly lighted and overcrowded. Buffaloes and sheep are housed in the hut side by side with human inhabitants. Refuse of all sorts was found strewn in the streets in front of these huts. As regards personal hygiene, the members of this community are in a very backward condition. Cloths, dirty and mostly in rags, form their only meagre dress. They lead a half starved life rarely having a decent meal a day. But they never miss their evening toddy. A bath is a luxury to them and lice abound in their matted hair. Their source of water-supply is invariably from a filthy pond or well in ruins used alike for drinking, bathing, cleaning utensils and washing animals. The Panchamas are so ignorant and superstitious as to ascribe the prevalence of this fever to the fault of one of their clansmen having bathed in the Mahamakam tank during the last Mahamakam festival in 1921 and thereby incurred the displeasure of the Gods. Mortality figures. On an examination of the death registers of the villages inspected by us, it was found that 1,415 deaths could be traced to this fever. The total number of attacks in these villages was 2,716. The records as to the number of attacks were not accurate; the figures above were obtained from the statements given by the villagers after searching house to house enquiries, whereas the number of deaths is more trustworthy, being based on the death registers kept by the Village Munsif and we were able to classify the deaths according to age and sex periods. The percentage of deaths to attacks varied in different villages from 15.09 to 95 per cent, the total average being 52 per cent. The percentage of attacks and deaths in reference to population could not be calculated, as the population, hamlet-war was not available in any office. Clinical features. No detailed and discriminate description is possible as the clinical notes were made under adverse circumstances and no notes of any case were available from any hospital or dispen- sary. The most striking point was the severity of the infection in general. The disease generally starts with a rigor, mild in a few cases but severe in very many. The patients were not able to state definitely whether there were any premonitory symptoms, as general malaise, etc. But headache was present in almost all cases and very often pain in the back and limbs. With rigor the temperature rises rapidly, and may go up to 105 on the first day. It is lower generally not attaining the maximum till the fourth or fifth day. The pyrexia lasted for six days in most cases. There is intense prostration from the beginning, which in severe cases, ends in a comatose condition. The temperature ordinarily comes down by crisis, the drop taking place in a few hours, leaving the patient cold, collapsed and bathed in profuse perspiration. Simultaneously with the fall of temperature the pulse rate becomes reduced. The temperature is very often subnormal after the crisis, 95 or 96, rarely 97. The apyrexial stage lasts four or five days, when there is a rebound in the temperature which may rise higher than prior to the crisis. The duration of this relapse may be prolonged from four to six days to be followed by a second crisis, the temperature falling again to subnormal. A slight icteric tinge of the conjunctiva is common, but graver types of fever were seen, where the patient was deeply jaundiced from the beginning, the conjunctiva of deep yellow, showing an advanced condition of toxæmia. In some villages, almost every other case showed marked jaundice, while in others no cases were found (as in Tirutturaippundi), though there were 83 attacks with 38 deaths there was not a single case with jaundice. Vomiting and nausea were not associated with jaundice. The tongue is usually flabby, but clean and moist. This appearance of the tongue has very often been noted except in those severe cases of the icteric types, where the tongue is dry and has a furred appearance. Parotitis was noticed in two cases. Spleen and liver were neither tender nor palpable even during the acute stages. The urine in many cases was reported. to have been deeply stained yellow. 36 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY No statistics could be taken with a view to determine the percentage of relapses. There were one or two cases where the fever was reported to have been continuous. Laboratory findings. As has been stated elsewhere, the epidemic was showing signs of abatement at the time I arrived at Tanjore. It will be seen from chart I, that the epidemic started in September 1921, and that the mortality rates gradually rose until it reached the climax, viz., 300 in January 1922, when it began to decline very slowly until March. But the rate dropped down suddenly to about 100 in April 1922. The number of cases in a pyrexial stage, whether of a primary or relapse nature, that came under my observation, subsequent to the 10th April was therefore necessarily limited by this fact. Table I gives a list of the 29 cases that were examined during or between pyrexial attacks with such particulars relating to the duration of the fever, as could be gathered from the ignorant relatives. The first of these cases was really convalescing after a relapse of fever and an examination of his peripheral blood yielded a negative result:REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 37 from a vein I inoculated the whole quantity into the monkey subcutaneously. The smears from the monkey taken on the following day and again on the next day both proved negative, but showed the presence of spirilla in the peripheral circulation on the 17th morning, i.e., 72 hours later. Under instruction from the Director, the monkey was taken to the King Institute on the 17th. Case No. 27.REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY LIST OF VILLAGES VISITED.

CRUICKSHANK, I.M.S., Assistant Director. I arrived at Kaiti on June 22nd to investigate the cause of cases of enteric fever which had occurred in the St. George's Home there. I was accompanied by Assistant Surgeon S. Ramakrishnan. There had been two cases among the boys one of whom had died and a post mortem examination revealed that the cause was enteric fever though unfortunately no attempt was made to isolate the causative organism. I also found a doubtful case in hospital. I established a laboratory in a room in the Principal's house on June 23rd. These are the following possibilities as to the causation of the cases:40 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY APPENDIX NO. V. REPORT INTO THE OUTBREAK OF CHOLERA IN THE COIMBATORE JAIL BY MAJOR J. A. CRUICKSHANK, I.M.S., AND CIVIL ASSISTANT SURGEON S. RAMAKRISHNAN. In accordance with verbal orders received from the Surgeon-General, I arrived at Coimbatore on the evening of June 26th. Assistant Surgeon S. Ramakrishnan with the laboratory equipment which had been at Kaity arrived late that night, the equipment was got to the jail on the morning of the 27th and the laboratory was immediately established in a room in the Jail Hospital. The equipment from the King Institute arrived on the morning of the 27th. I immediately commenced an investigation into the epidemic and personally investigated the possible sources of the infection. At the same time I started an inquiry into the possibility of there being carriers in the jail and had the water-supply thoroughly examined. Having satisfied myself that the epidemic had died down and that the prevent- ive measures which had been carried out were sufficient to render its recurrence unlikely, I left Coimbatore on July 2nd leaving Assistant Surgeon Ramakrishnan to complete the investigation on the lines I had laid down. There were 36 cases of suspected cholera in the Jail Hospital on the 27th, many of whom had been there some days and had reached the convalescent stage and were not passing frequent stools. The establishment of the diagnosis being the first necessity, I immediately proceeded with the bacteriological examination of such stools as were available choosing, as far as possible, the more recent cases as being most likely to yield positive results. In all, cultures were made from eight cases, in peptone water, and organisms isolated by plating on Aronson's medium and cultivating in agar tubes. In these ways isolated colonies were obtained which were tested microscopically, with high titre serum and by all other tests with the result that on the 29th I was able to say that we had isolated true cholera vibrios from four out of the eight cases examined. Short details of the cases are given below. Case 1.REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 41 excreting cholera vibrios on 5th and 6th July respectively. One died. One case of gastro enteritis occurred on 18th July. He had severe vomitting and purging. Bacteriological examination failed to reveal any sign of Cholera. From the history and clinical condition Dr. Ramakrishnan is of opinion that it was due to irritation caused by eating cocoanuts. He recovered. Having thus established the diagnosis of the epidemic, we proceeded to inquire into its history and to commence an investigation into its causation. History of the Epidemic. Seventy-six cases of cholera with 43 deaths have occurred in the Jail. The first case occurred on 14th May, the second on 28th May from which date until the explosive outburst commenced on 20th June, a case occurred every 3rd or 4th day. All these earlier cases seven in number proved fatal. The details of the number of cases and the dates on which they occurred are shown graphically on the chart. Prior to May 14th, there had been occasional cases of gastro enteritis 15 in all since January 1st. Three of these cases died. Six had been discharged by the time of our visit, the remaining six were examined by us. Inquiry showed that the cases occurred all over the main jail. Only six cases occurred in the annexe. The distribution of the cases is shown on the plan of the jail at the end of the report. Eight of the cases were on mixed diet, the remainder being rice eaters. All but 14 were Mappillas. Inquiry into where the cases had been working, showed a slight but not marked preponderance among factory workers. Causation of the Epidemic. In view of the facts detailed in the last paragraph my suspicions fell on the water-supply especially as an examination of the last report showed that the water was bad. The sudden cessation of the epidemic after chlorination of the water was commenced by the order of the Inspector-General of Prisons on June 25th lent support to the view that the infection was probably water-borne. The drinking water-supply of the main jail is derived from the æromotor well at the main gate from which it is pumped to a covered tank. Work had been going on at this well during the preceding three weeks, removing the æromotors, etc. On examination certain defects were found. (1) The parapet wall around the well was broken for the pumping arrangements, thus permitting surface drainage to enter the well. (2) The manhole in the cement cover at the top of the well proper42 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY Enteric Fever. There were 13 cases of enteric fever in the hospital, six of whom had come from the annexe. Most of the cases had been diagnosed by widal reaction done at the King Institute. We took over the bacteriological control of these cases, the results are given in the summary of laboratory work done at the end of the report. No fresh cases of enteric have occurred since July 3rd up to the time of our departure. Dysentery. There are 18 cases of dysentery in the hospital and 34 cases in the post dysenteric gang. The stools of all admissions are now examined macroscopically every day for a month before they are discharged into the general population of the jail by Sub-Assistant Surgeon M. K. Menon who was trained in this work at Bellary Jail. Laboratory work. I commenced the following investigations which I left Assistant Surgeon Ramakrishnan of this Institute to complete:REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 43 The following table shows at a glance the laboratory work performed at Coimbatore Jail:44 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY Coimbatore Central Jail. W. S. No. 75 of 1922. The samples from the æromotor well, Garden well No.1 and factory well contain vibrios. The sample from the annexe well is by far the best of the series and also of the wells in the Coimbatore district so far examined at this Institute. It is much less hard, contains only about a third of the total solids present normally in other wells, and the major portion of the hardness is temporary and removeable. If this supply could be utilized for the whole jail, it would mark very definite improvement as far as the water-supply of the jail is con- cerned. The samples from the æromotor and garden wells particularly show a considerable excess of organic matter both in an oxidised and unoxidised condition. Seeing that the condition of the water-supply is far from satisfactory, it appears impera- tive that a system of efficient chlorination or boiling should be inaugurated.

REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 45 APPENDIX No. VI. REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY ATTACHED TO THE CANNANORE CENTRAL JAIL BY TEMPORARY CIVIL ASSISTANT SURGEON K. V. KRISHNAN. Acting under the orders of the Director of King Institute, I proceeded to the Central Jail, Cannanore, on 9th September 1922 in charge of a mobile bacteriological unit with the necessary laboratory equipment and two laboratory attendants. About this time Dysentery, Ankylostomiasis, Cerebro-spinal Fever and Chicken-pox were prevalent in the Mappilla country. Mappilla prisoners were coming into the Cannanore Jail in quick succession in the most miserable state of health. These were bringing infection with them and were transmitting it to the several jails to which they were being subsequently transferred after a period of stay in this jail, which varied from a day to a month. The Director discussed the matter with the Inspector-General of Prisons and decided that the Cannanore Central Jail should be made to act as a clearing station for the Mappilla prisoners as far as their health was concerned. Every Mappilla prisoner as soon as he was convicted was to be sent into the Cannanore Central Jail and was to undergo a quarantine for a period of fifteen days during which time he was to be thoroughly examined bacteriologically to see whether he was a carrier of any of the infectious diseases prevalent such as Dysentery, Cerebro-spinal Fever, etc. By this arrangement the control of epidemic in the various jails, to which these prisoners were transferred, was to be attempted. Before starting I took detailed instructions from the Director regarding the selection of rooms for the laboratory as well as for the bacteriological examinations to be carried out and the hygienic and sanitary methods to be adopted in controlling any epidemics. The unit left the King Institute within 12 hours' notice and reached Cannanore the following evening. It was definitely understood that the unit was to be an off-shoot of the King Institute, receiving all its requirements in the way of media, stains and other apparatus from the Central laboratory at Guindy. Media and stains essential for the work of the unit were made up at the King Institute and sent in convenient bulk to Cannanore as often as required. This procedure worked well and enabled a large volume of routine work to be carried on efficiently with the minimum of staff and equipment and in a shorter time than would have been possible otherwise. Specimens of a complex nature requiring detailed bacteriological examination were sent to the Central laboratory for confirmation and favour of the Director's opinion. Within a fortnight of my arrival, the Director inspected the laboratory and considered that the location and arrangements for the conduct of the laboratory work were suitable in every way. As there was as yet no efficient system of quarantine for want of proper accom- modation for prisoners, I pointed out to him the desirability of enforcing a proper system of quarantine whereby no prisoner could leave the jail before a minimum stay of 15 days in the quarantine and until he is declared to be in a fit condition to be transferred as a result of a detailed bacteriological examination when necessary. The Director was in favour of this idea and wrote to the Inspector-General of Prisons making this suggestion and pointing out in addition the necessary extra accommodation which was essential to give effect to this recom- mendation. This scheme was accepted by the Inspector-General of Prisons and the accom- modation was forthwith doubled. The Assistant Director inspected the laboratory on the 23rd December 1922 and reported that the work was progressing satisfactorily. The number of specimens examined at this laboratory during the period of seven months it stayed at Cannanore, totalled 3,435, made up of 1,463 naso-pharyngeal swabs for the detection of meningococci, 966 specimens of stools for the presence of Ankylostome ova, 357 stools for the presence of amoebic cysts, 85 cultural examinations from cases of latent dysentery, and 564 specimens of a varied nature from the hospital. In addition, the microscopic examination of 40,540 specimens of excreta from 4,254 convicts was made with a view to detecting latent dysentery cases, 1,124 of these proved positive, 238 of which, however, were considered suspicious. (See table attached.) 12

In all, there were 128 cases of Dysentery of which 121 came from the Bowel Gang out of a total strength of whereas from amongst the convicts declared healthy there were only seven cases out of a total strength of 4,277. The healthy group furnishing only 5.5 per cent of the cases of Dysentery whereas 94.5 per cent of the cases were admitted from the Bowel Gang who had already been declared infected and suffering from Dysentery in a latent form. The admissions for Dysentery from middle of November to middle of December showed an increase both from the normals and the abnor- mals. During these months the number of flies was excessive. A regular campaign for the extermination of these insects was started and when these were controlled the admissions for Dysentery fell. The Jail surroundings were cleared of all shrubbery and special care was paid to the proper maintenance of the latrines and disposal of excreta. Additional sanitary measures were recommended to ensure a clean kitchen. The figures for admission and death from Dysentery in September 1922 were 27 and 10 respectively. The corresponding figures for March were 12 and 2 respectively. The daily average jail population in September was only 1,393 while in March it rose to 1,662. (See Graph III.) These satisfactory results were certainly due in a large measure, to the prompt detection isolation and treatment of the latent dysentery cases and also to the fact that within a fortnight of our arrival, I eliminated 15 out of 50 cooks who were handling the food- supplies as being carriers of latent Dysentery. Three of these men were actually suffering at the time from an acute attack of the diesase. An interesting feature revealed during these observations is one which Major Cunning- ham drew pointed attention to, in his Dysentery Enquiry in Bengal and which was again observed in the Bellary Enquiry, viz., that a higher proportion of abnormals was detected from amongst the more recent arrivals into the Jail, when compared with the groups who had been in the Jails for some time receiving the benefit of a systematised and up-to-date treat- ment and living amidst sanitary surroundings. Out of the 966 convicts who were in the Jail at the time I commenced work, only 212 or 22.2 per cent were found to have latent Dysen- tery; of these 27 or 2.9 per cent were classed as suspicious and out of 3,088 new arrivals 912 or 29.5 per cent had latent Dysentery; of these 211 or 6.8 per cent were classed as suspicious. Cerebro-spinal fever. At the time enquiry started at Cannanore, there were no cases of Cerebro-spinal fever in the Jail and so the Director thought it unnecessary to examine for Cerebro-spinal fever carriers. On the 20th of October, there was a case cerebro-spinal fever in the local sub-jail. On enquiry it was found to be prevalent in a sporadic form in the Mappilla country and at Calicut where the Mappillas were being sent for trial. Reports from Bellary also revealed the fact that some of the Mappilla prisoners recently transferred to that Jail contracted Cerebro- spinal fever. As large batches of Mappilla prisoners were coming into the clearing station from these infected places, it was feared that an epidemic might break out. As this disease is known to occur in aggregations of people living in over-crowded places the following precautions were taken as per the recommendations of the Director:48 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 4. The Director had laid special stress on the prevention of over-crowding. Every convict had the proper amount of air space and at night special care was taken to see that their heads were kept a minimum of one yard apart and a strict watch was kept to prevent the closing up of the space. In the sheds where convicts were chained, it was so arranged that every other convict was on the opposite side of the chain. Only 5 sporadic cases of Cerebro-spinal fever occurred during the stay of the laboratory at Cannanore. Three of these occurred in the clearing Jail and two in the sub-jails. All the five cases were detected in the quarantine itself within 48 hours of their arrival, as a result of the prompt adoption of the methods recommended by the Director. The cases were diag- nosed by microscopical and cultural examinations. The Cerebro-spinal fluid in each case was removed by Lumbar puncture. Smears showed gram-negative intra and extra cellular dip- lococci. Cultural methods gave meningococci types 1 and 2 in four cases. 1,463 naso- pharyngeal swabs were examined for meningococci but all were negative although no difficulty was experienced in obtaining this organism from the cerebro-spinal fluid when it was present in the fluid. In 400 of these, a detailed examination was made of every colony in the culture tube but in no case was the specific organism present. Fresh supplies of special culture media from the King Institute were sent for this work every week. Chicken-pox. Chicken-pox was prevalent in epidemic form at the time of starting the laboratory. It was however immediately brought under control by proper segregation and disinfection. Vaccination and revaccination of every convict in the Jail was done side by side so as to ensure the freedom of the Jail from the possibility of an undetected outbreak of smallpox occurring in the guise of chicken-pox. Tuberculosis. The sputum of every case suspected to be suffering from tuberculosis was examined and convicts found to be suffering from active disease were separated out and treated as hospital patients in a separate tubercular ward. In all 26 cases were sent into this ward at various periods, Five of these had died by the time, I left Cannanore. Leprosy. The laboratory established the diagnosis of this disease in one case out of six cases examined. Ankylostomiasis. As most of the Mappillas in the jail looked very anæmic, 966 men were examined for Ankylostomiasis and 95.2 per cent were found infected. Hence every convict during his stay in the quarantine the first fortnight, was given a routine course of Thymol which was repeated within a fortnight in most of the cases. This procedure helped very materially to improve the general condition of the convicts. PyorrhREPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 49 was transferred. Any further details as to future attacks of diseases, etc., was to be made on his card there. By this system it is hoped that there would be an improvement in50 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY APPENDIX No. VII. REPORT ON THE EXPERIMENTS CARRIED OUT AT THE GUINDY EXPERIMENTAL FILTERS BETWEEN 1921 AND 1923. Experiments on the rapid filtration of water through sand filters as a preliminary to suitable chemical treatment, were carried out with the experimental filter plant at Guindy, as opportunity offered between 1921 and 1923, under the direction of the Committee on Water Filtration. These experiments were completed in May of the present year (1923). The detailed report on these, experiments which had been promised in the last annual report of the King Institute of Preventive Medicine, is now submitted for the information of Government. The idea of carrying out these experiments first originated from similar experiments performed by Sir Alexander Houston, who in his research report published in 1920 strongly advocated very rapid filtration of water through slow sand filters, followed or pre- ceded by chemical treatment, as the safest and at the same time the most economical of purification processes. When chemical means of purification is resorted to, some form of filtration is necessary in most cases for preliminary clarification, sterilization being subse- quently carried out by the addition of the chemical. In these circumstances the rate of filtration can be increased to an unlimited extent, so long as the preliminary clarification is satisfactory. As the Committee had no information as to the behaviour of sand filters when used for this purpose, it was considered advisable to divide the investigation into the chemical treat- ment of water into two parts, viz., (1) The discovery of the best and most economical means of using sand filters as a preliminary to chlorination. (2) The best and most effective method of chlorination. It is obvious that the experiments initiated to decide part I, must be the necessary precursors to the second part of the investigation. The Committee have therefore devoted their time to experiments on rapid filtration in the first instance and the results obtained from these experiments form the subject matter of the present report. In order to determine the extent of clarification effected by rapid sand filtration, apart from considerations of bacterial purification, the sand filters at Guindy which had been subjected in the previous year to certain structural alterations were utilised in their altered condition for the present experiments.* The present series of experiments were carried out at rates of filtration varying from 8 to 16 vertical inches per hour. The thickness of the fine sand layer was 12 inches in both the filters. It appears necessary at this stage, to mention one important factor which constituted a serious handicap to the continuity of the experiments and caused considerable delay in their execution. The results obtained with each series of experiments to be of comparable value, should be derived from experiments carried out, and repeated for confirmation, under identical conditions of the raw water. Now, the raw water of the Adyar River changes continually as the result of local and general storms. Almost every experiment has therefore had to await the necessary conditions of the raw water before repetition was justified. Fourteen separate experiments have been carried out in all. Ten of these, which are strictly comparable with each other have been described. Tables I and II give full details of the bacteriological and chemical examination of the various samples taken during experimentation. The Chart gives a measurement of the turbidity, the composition of the filters, the lengths of the runs and other engineering details. These have been prepared and recorded by M.R.Ry. K. V. Narasimha Ayyangar, Superintendent, Experimental Filters, Guindy. The earliest experiment carried out in June 1921 was of the nature of a preliminary trial and is not included in the present series. In this experiment the rate of filtration was gradually increased from 4 inches to 8 inches vertical per hour, and the results obtained justified the adoption of 8 inches as the rate for the first series of experiments, now recorded. The first definite experiment was conducted with both filters in August of the same year, a uniform rate of filtration, viz., 8 inches vertical per hour being maintained from the begin- ning to the end of the run. The filters ran for 29 days and the water of the Adyar River which at this period was whitish and opaque as a result of a moderately heavy rainfall during * Note.51 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY the previous week, was rendered sufficiently clear within the first four days of starting the filters. The clarity continued to be satisfactory during the rest of the run. The organic matter was reduced by about one-half and the total number of bacteria was reduced by about 70 per cent and there was at least a fifty-fold improvement with regard to the lactose fermenters. The same experiment was repeated twice between September and November 1921. The second experiment carried out between 14th October and 12th November 1921 is alone taken into account, as the conditions present during the first were not comparable. During this period there was a comparatively heavy and well-distributed rainfall (between 16th October and 5th November 1921). This rain produced a very turbid initial feed water; the filters however functioned very satisfactorily and not only rendered the water clear but also removed the excess of organic and bacterial pollution to an appreciable extent. This experiment fully confirmed the results obtained in the first experiment. It was now decided by the Committee that even while the rains lasted, some experiments on a rate higher than 8 inches should be tried. Further experiments with 8 inches, under fair weather and high flood conditions, were therefore postponed until later. In December 1921 both the filters were started at a rate of 12 inches vertical per hour. The rainfall during this period was not so great as in the preceding experiments. There was however, an increased turbidity in the water of the river on 9 out of the 19 days during which the filters were worked. This increase was not quite so great as was anticipated. The results, as far as both clarification and filtration were concerned, were satisfactory. The yield of filtered water in gallons for the entire period, while working at this rate, compared very favourably with that at 8 inches. At the end of this experiment it was apparent that there would be no more rainfall and therefore it was next decided to raise the rate of filtration to 16 inches vertical per hour, for it was considered that, if the results of filtration with that rate, with an initially clear water were not satisfactory, there would be no necessity for trying the higher rate with a flood water. The filters worked for only eleven days at this rate (16 inches), and although the results of filtration were satisfactory from the bacteriological point of view, the total yield in gallons of the filtered water during the period of the run had dwindled down by about 30 per cent, as compared with the 8 and 12-inch rates. The experiment was again repeated in February 1922 with identical results. The Committee therefore considered that the 16-inch rate was not of practical value on account of the rapidity with which the filters went out of action, no advantage in the quantity of the filtered. water being obtained as a possible set-off against the increased cost of maintenance. Experiments at a 16-inch rate with turbid water were therefore not considered necessary. Between March and June experiments with the 8-inch rate were repeated in the hopes that local thunder-storms, which are usual at this time of the year, would bring the necessary conditions of the raw water. No rain however fell, while the experiments were in progress. The results of these experiments have not therefore been discussed as they are not comparable with the remainder. Towards the end of August 1922 the experiments were again commenced. Except for a few slight falls in the month of September, there was little appreciable rainfall. The filters ran at a rate of 8 inches vertical per hour for 30 days and then clogged. The raw water was for the most part only hazy. The clarity effected by the filters was satisfactory. The percentage removal of bacteria and the reduction of lactose fermenters were very marked (90 per cent reduction in the total count and a 5,000-fold reduction of lactose fermenters on an average). With the setting-in of the monsoon, satisfactory conditions for the continuation of the experiments were established. The two filters were started on 27th October at a rate of 8 inches vertical per hour. They ran for 33 days. On this occasion the filters failed to effect complete clarification. The filtrate remained slightly hazy during the entire period of the run. The amount of haziness however, was not considered sufficient to condemn the filtrate from the point of view of the experiments. A similar condition has been recorded by Sir Alexander Houston in the case of the Thames water, during certain seasons. Sir Alexander Houston considers, that a hazy filtrate is unavoidable under such conditions. The filters were found to have effected a 64 per cent reduction in the total number of bacteria and a 1,000- fold improvement on an average, with regard to lactose fermenters. The reduction in the quantity of organic matter was also quite satisfactory. This experiment conclusively proved that, even under extreme conditions, the rate of filtration could be increased to 8 inches vertical per hour, while at the same time, a filtrate could be obtained which was satisfactory both as regards yield and quality for subsequent chemical treatment. The next was a repetition experiment in which the 12-inch rate was tested with both the filters. The Adyar River water was very turbid at the beginning of the experiment but gradually cleared up so that at the end of the experiment, the filters were dealing with a fairly clear water. The filters ran for 17 days and the filtrates were satisfactory in every way. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of 74936657.tif]
52 REPORT ON TEE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY When the filters were not being used for the experiments on rapid filtration, certain other experiments which were awaiting solution were carried out. The Sanitary Engineer had suggested that a few experiments on the question of "inter- mittent " and " continuous " filtration might be carried out as he found that at certain places intermittent filtration with slow sand filters was being practised. Both the sand filters were utilized for this experiment. It was soon shown that the practice of running a slow sand filter intermittently was most unsatisfactory. Continuous filtration yielded uniformly good results while intermittent filtration resulted in frequent breaks in the film through which raw water passed into the filtered water chamber. Intermittent filtration is therefore a wasteful and unsafe method of purifying water. At the same time the mechanical filters were used for preliminary tests on the correct technique for matting sand beds with alum. These experiments were to be carried out on lines similar to those which had already been carried out in America with good results. Both the Jewel and Paterson filters were used and it was found that the method was, as far as the experiments went, promising. It was decided by the Committee that this method should be given a thorough trial under varying conditions of the raw water. These experiments will therefore be reported upon, when they are completed. The last two experiments of the series consisted of a repetition of the 12-inch rate under fine weather conditions. These were commenced in April 1923 and completed by the end of May. Only one of the filters, viz., the filter with tiles, was now available for experi- mentation as the other had been altered in design for a different experiment of an urgent nature, which was then in progress. The filter ran for 18 days on the first occasion and 17 days on the second. The raw water was hazy and contained the maximum amount of solids and organic matter. Tho bacteriological results were also very bad. The filtrate was perfectly clear and the reduction in the organic matter and bacteria was very satisfactory. The organic matter was reduced by about 50 per cent; bacteria by 94 per cent; and lactose fermenters reduced 2,000-fold on an average. The following conclusions from these experiments appear to be justifiable:GUINDY EXPERIMENTAL FILTERS.

REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 55 APPENDIX No. VIII. REPORT ON THE OCCURRENCE OF CEREBRO-SPINAL FEVER IN THE BELLARY CENTRAL JAIL BY MILITARY ASSISTANT SURGEON J. H. THEODORE, I.M.D. Under orders from the Director of the King Institute, I proceeded to the Central Jail, Bellary, on 20th March 1923. The Medical Officer of the jail had reported that five cases of cerebro-spinal fever had occurred in the jail, between 25th February 1923 and 10th March 1923. The following data gathered from the report of the Medical Officer were significant of an epidemic that called for scrutiny from a bacteriological standpoint on which preventive measures to arrest the epidemic could be based:56 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY excess of last year's figure of 16, but the in-patient figure of 25 for last year, has a corres- ponding nil admission this year. Again in February last year, there were ten out-patient cases whereas in February this year the figure stood at 44 which is apparently high but not really so when it is remembered that the out-patient cases of the previous month continue to be treated during the following month. It is needless to amplify, as enough evidence has been advanced to show that the incidence of malaria is not unduly high. The other important factor to consider is the nature of the infection and the possibility of cerebral malaria. Evidence available as to the existing type of malaria points to a benign infection as the great majority of cases diagnosed as malaria microscopically, were of the benign type including the four cases of malaria among the cerebro-spinal fever cases. Two cases of acute malaria reported sick in my presence and a blood examination revealed a benign infection. These points together with the evidence of the Medical Officer who states that malaria is not met with, in any but the mildest type remove the suspicion that the epidemic of cerebro-spinal fever was influenced by an unduly heavy malarial infection. The disease as a whole has had no influence or bearing on the occurrence of the cases of cerebro-spinal fever. III.

The disposal of sewage and waste products of conservancy in a profitable manner was the subject of examination by a special committee which recom- mended unanimously that a deputation of experts may be sent to China and Japan to study the methods employed there. As the Government of India were unable to arrange for an All-India deputation and were not prepared to contribute towards the cost of a deputation from this Government, the matter had to be dropped. 7.

ScientificREPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, GUINDY, FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1923-24. INTRODUCTION. As in the previous year the King Institute has continued to function as:2 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY The scheme put up in my letter R.C. No. 15729-2/V., dated 29th April 1923, has now advanced sufficiently to merit more detailed consideration. The suggested improvements concern:3 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY vaccinators instead of three times as formerly and these supplies have to be used up by the vaccinator within four days of receipt. This change ensures the use of the lymph in the fresh state only and is therefore a decided improvement over the old system. The lymph is now issued in glass vials and, as a very large number of these are used owing to the more frequent distribution, arrangements have been made for their return to the Institute once a quarter. A considerable saving in material has thus been effected. A rotary lancet suitable for use with glycerine lymph has been introduced by the Institute and has been recommended to the Director of Public Health for general use. More even results cannot fail to follow the general introduction of this instrument. Complete instructions for the use of glycerine lymph have been drawn up in the Institute. These instructions have been issued by the Director of Public Health in his circular letter No. D. 66-P.H., dated 7th March 1924, and have been copied by him into his letter R. No. 534-3- P.H., dated 27th March 1924, which has been issued by Government as G.O. No. 1125-P.H., dated 6th August 1924. Attention has also been paid to the returns of vaccinations performed. These forms were completely revised so as to give all the information required during the year 1922-23. Once filled in by the Health Inspectors, these are now sent through the District Health Officers who scrutinize them before despatch to the Institute. In this way a more complete check upon wastage and careless work on the part of the vaccinators has been instituted. The habit of indenting for a certain percentage of lymph over and above actual requirements to allow for wastage has been prohibited and the rules dealing with extra indents and deviation from the vaccinators' fixed programme have been made more stringent. As in 1922-23 routine vaccination was discontinued during the hottest months of the year. In the present case, however, there was a uniform cessation for four months in all districts. This was the original recommendation made by the Director in putting forward this proposal in 1922 but the desire to interfere with the vaccination work as little as possible led Government to cut the four months period down to two months in the case of those districts receiving the south-west monsoon. Last year's experience proved that the advent of the monsoon had no beneficial effect on the success rate in those districts. The original proposal of a universal four months' cessation was therefore agreed to this year. 2,184,590 cases of vaccine lymph were despatched from the vaccine section during the year (vide statement 1). This is the largest issue on record since the Institute was founded and exceeds that of the previous year by over 104,000. The fear that the hot weather cessation of operations would decrease the number of operations performed has thus proved to be unfounded. The supplies to District Boards again show the chief increase. Those to municipalities, jails, private bodies and the Superintendent of Vaccination, Secunderabad, show a slight decrease over the previous year's issues. Attention was drawn last year to the large amount of lymph issued which was entirely unaccounted for in the returns received by the Institute. This figure was no less than 38.9 per cent of all the lymph issued. The percentage of lymph unaccounted for this year is 29.8 (see statement 2). Ten out of the 24 districts show a shortage of over 30 per cent and in the case of Anantapur (62.5), Vizagapatam (55.1), South Kanara (52.6), South Arcot (49.7), Salem (49.4), R4 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 62,521 doses of bacterial vaccines were issued from the Bacteriological section during the year. The number of specimens examined by the section was 7,546. This does not include the number of examinations carried out by the various investigation units while in the field, which amounted to 9,888. The Public Health section examined 1,346 specimens. The work of both these sections will be reviewed in greater detail later. III.REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 5 A very careful record of the results obtained with the different seeds produced by Nejland's method and various modifications has been kept and it will shortly be possible to make a definite pronouncement as to the most suitable procedure to follow to obtain the best results. (b) Type of lymph issued.6 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY to represent the number of operations which would have been performed had there been no cessation of vaccination during the hot weather, then it is estimated that about 27,000 cases were successfully vaccinated this year which would have been failures under the older régime. This estimate is almost certainly well below the truth for, in the years before the hot weather cessation was introduced, it was the custom to carry out the major part of the operations during the hot season. Statement 5 (Chart II) shows the success rates obtained for primary vaccina- tions by the different districts. The marked improvement recorded this year as the result of the introduction of glycerine lymph is reflected in all the district returns. Even the worst districts show an increased rate of success. The order in which each district is placed however remains much the same. The least successful districts with lanoline lymph remain so with the new glycerine lymph. Only nine districts show a success rate of under 90 per cent, the lowest returns being made by Vizagapatam (85.6), Kurnool (85.7), GREPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 7 These figures compare very favourably with the vaccination results obtained in any other country and show what success can be achieved when care8 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE INSTITUTE, GUINDY (ii) BACTERIOLOGICAL SECTION. (a) Manufacture of vaccines.REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 9 The number of samples of water examined during the year was 1,104 (state- ment 14). The half-yearly routine examinations from Municipalities, Jail and Railway station supplies accounted for 461 samples. Two hundred and eighty- one samples were derived from the experimental plant and 362 from the Madras Corporation. The appointment of a water analyst by the Madras Corporation and the completion of his training at the King Institute so that he was able to assume his duties at Kilpauk was in part responsible for this decline. Further, the necessity for intensive sampling disappeared as definite conclusions on the Madras City water-supply were reached during the year. It has been the custom hitherto in this report to give a review of the various protected water-supplies in the Presidency which have been examined during the course of the year. A study of the reports which have been written during the past few years reveals the fact that there is a striking similarity between them all. Certain installations always produce good or fair results. Others are always unsatisfactory. The remarks made in this report year by year appear to have little or no influence in producing any change for the better. The usual detailed review is therefore omitted this year and those interested are referred to appendix (Appendix No. 1) where a short summary of the behaviour of each installation is given. (iv) COMMITTEE ON WATER FILTRATION. All the water analyses for the experiments carried on by this Committee and the greater part of the administrative work is carried on in the King Institute. During the course of the year the chief problem before the Committee continued to be the best means of improving the Madras City water-supply. A comprehen- sive report on the position of the Madras water-supply as it stood in April 1923 was passed by the Committee and forwarded to Government and the Corporation. In this report the Committee pointed out that they had always been aware that mechanical filtration had been the correct method of purifying the supply but that with the slow sand filtration plant already in existence their experiments up to that time had been directed towards discovering a method of making the existing plant work satisfactorily. All attempts had so far proved unsatisfactory but the possibilities had been narrowed down considerably and, should the experiments then in progress fail to give satisfactory results, then no alternative would remain to the introduction of mechanical filtration. These final experiments were com- pleted during the course of the summer. This want of success convinced Mr. Madeley, the Special Engineer to the Corporation of Madras, that the Com- mittee's original opinion that mechanical filtration was the only method which would give satisfactory results was correct and he placed a detailed scheme for the modification of the present plant on a mechanical filtration basis before the Madras Corporation in his note of November the 8th. This note was forwarded to the Committee for their opinion in Government's letter No. 709-1, L. & M., dated 10th January 1924. A second report dealing with Mr. Madeley's note and giving a complete summary of the whole situation with the Committee's recommendations was forwarded to Government with the President of the Committee's letter, dated 13th June 1924. The arguments for mechanical filtration advanced in this report are unanswerable. The problem of the Madras City water-supply so far as the Committee is concerned, may therefore be considered as solved. It now remains to be seen whether the Madras Corporation will act upon the advice given by the Committee. The experimental filter plant at the King Institute has been utilized in testing the effect of a preliminary filming of slow sand filters with alum. These experi- ments are still in progress. The results available so far show that the method is a promising one for certain types of water.

(v) INVESTIGATION UNITS. A second investigation unit was sanctioned in G.O. No. 1766-P.H., dated 26th October 1923. Both of these units were engaged in investigations in the field for the greater part of the year. They were utilized on four separate occasions:11 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY disease and a very close relationship was shown to exist between these cases and cases of latent dysentery. It was discovered that cases of latent dysentery which had been previously isolated had been returned to the general population and that these latent cases were undoubtedly responsible for the periodic outbreaks of gastro-enteritis which had occurred. The outbreak therefore was really an acute exacerbation of the endemic dysentery present in jail. The re-establishment of the search for latent dysentery cases by systematic microscopic examination of the stools and the isolation of such cases when found, soon brought the epidemic under control.

The malarial survey at Sappal Hills.12 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY The Government Fisheries Department applied for the help of the Institute to investigate the cause of the development of a pink discoloration which had been occurring in samples of dried fish. The investigation showed that this dis- coloration called 'Pink eye' was due to the growth of an organism called the "Rhodococcus" and was the same as a condition which had just been reported as occurring in England due to the same cause. The Institute has as usual undertaken the cold storage and distribution of various perishable veterinary supply such as sera, for the Veterinary department. The whole cost of packing and distribution is borne by the Institute. VI.13 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY The exhibit of 12 photographs illustrating the various activities of the King Institute which was forwarded last year to the Pasteur Centenary Exhibition at Strasburg was awarded a diploma de Grand Prix by the Exhibition authorities. The Exhibit was sent from Strasburg to the British Empire Exhibition where it is now on view in the Tropical diseases section. VII.14 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY Madras Government at the fifth Congress of the Far Eastern Association of Tropical Medicine held at Malaya in September 1923. A report upon the proceedings was forwarded to Government in my letter No. 5389REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 15 districts. The demand for the services of these units has always exceeded the supply and they have been instrumental in saving many serious situations where epidemic disease threatened to get or was actually out of control. They have also been instrumental in throwing new light on many medical problems and they can be looked upon as the embryo of a new research department in Madras which must of necessity develop in the near future. The staff of the Institute has also devoted much time to original research work and some very interesting and important results in different medical problems have been obtained in this direction. Finally the value of the Institute from the financial point of view has been conclusively demonstrated and Government now recognize that the Institute not only pays its way but brings in a handsome profit in addition. This satisfactory record of progress could not have been achieved without the whole-hearted and loyal support of all members of the staff. The Director wishes to thank all those who have helped to bring the King Institute to its present position of efficiency. J. CUNNINGHAM, LT.-CoL., I.M.S., Director.

REPORT OF THE VANIYAMBADI CHOLERA INVESTIGATION UNIT BY N. SESHADRINATHAN, Civil Assistant Surgeon. Under orders from the Director the unit arrived on the 13th June 1923 at Vaniyambadi. The investigation began the same day. The epidemic had already begun to show signs of abatement. The daily incidence had come down from 5 or 6 to 2 or 3. The cases had been coming from all the subdivisions of the town. On the 13th a specimen of stools was examined and true cholera vibrios were isolated and confirmed by the Institute. Considerable difficulty was experienced especially in the Muhammadan quarters owing to the prevailing Gosha system, and cases were reported only after the 2nd or 3rd day or only in case of death. Altogether 43 specimens of faces were examined. Thirteen were positive; from 16 stools of cases on the first or second day after the attack, 13 cases gave positive results. Five specimens of stools were sent to the Institute preserved in 30 per cent glycerine and in oxbile media. In two cases Cholera Vibrios were isolated from oxbile media. A report of the progress of the work was sent to the Director who gave further instructions regarding the investigation. Thirteen samples of water from various public wells, and 8 samples of food sold in the open bazaar were examined for cholera vibrios though in none were cholera vibrios found, they were, however, found to be heavily infected by foetal organisms. From one sample of water a suspicious strain was sent to the Institute where, however, it was proved to be not true cholera. The source and means of spread of the epidemic into the town as investigated was consistent with the sporadic nature of the epidemic. It originated from a village near by called Udaiyendrum. From there it was brought to a paracheri on the 9th of February and within two days the whole cheri was affected. It was not controlled till the common well which was the source of drinking water for them, was Hankinised. Even then cases used to occur because the people began to recontaminate the water when the colour began to fade. Pouring kerosene oil into the well was the only method of preventing them from using the well. On the 2nd of March two of the main subdivisions Kaderpet and Ambarpet got affected at the same time through pariah servants from the infected Paracheri. The location of these two subdivisions deserves some notice considering the fact that they had the highest incidence of cases, and the disease continued to rage till the end of the epidemic in June. They are both situated on either side of the river Palar but at a little higher level than other parts of the town. The private wells contain only brackish water. A number of shallow pot wells are dug in the riverbed for drinking water. These were heavily infected because the drainage from the houses is allowed to soak into the bed of the river. New town is well planned out and far away from the riverbed. The cases here were few and were almost all imported. A barber midwife was the medium of infection in one instance; by attending on an abortion case, the result of cholera, she spread the infection among the barber's quarters where several cases occurred within two days owing to the common well being contaminated. The nature of the drinking water in the private wells had much to do in the spread of the epidemic. The people of Chinnampet and Periapet derived their drinking water from private wells which derived its source from an uncontaminated branch of the Palar river, viz., Jannappar. As the water was not brackish the people did not resort to the pot wells on the riverbed for drinking water. This explains the small incidence of cholera during the epidemic as well as in previous epidemics. On the 17th July 1923 the unit was ordered to return and arrived on the 23rd July. STATEMENT.

27 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY APPENDIX No. III. REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE MOBILE UNIT AT ALIPURAM JAIL, BELLARY BY MILITARY ASSISTANT SURGEON J. H. THEODORE AND CIVIL ASSISTANT SURGEON N. SESHADRINATHAN. Under instructions from the Director, King Institute, I proceeded to Bellary with the necessary outfit on the 12th October 1923 to investigate the causation of an epidemic of "gastro-enteritis" occurring in the Alipuram Jail. Periodic outbreak of this disease have been reported by the Medical Officer of the jail. The first outbreak consisted of about 21 cases during the months of January and February 1923 with one death. All had diarrh28 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY In most of the stools examined hanging drop preparations showed the specimen swarm- ing with pleomorphic organisms resembling spirobacilli. Ninety cases were examined in all. In all of them this spiro-bacillus was found. Samples of cooked rice from the kitchen onwards down to the plates from which they were eaten by the convicts all showed this spiro bacillus on cultural examination. No evidence of the pathogenicity of this organism had been obtained. However, at the suggestion of the Director the sera from recoverd cases were sent to Guindy to be tested against this organism as well as against cholera. No posi- tive result was obtained. By serological and by animal experiments this organism was proved to be non-pathogenic and was found to bear no relationship to the present epidemic nor could Whitmore's bacillus be incriminated as the causative agent. On 20th November 1923 Dr. Theodore arrived at the Alipuram Jail.From his previous bacteriological experience in this jail and his observations on the then existing cases of gastro-enteritis, I was able to derive much help in planning out my work. He suggested that B. Dysenteriæ should be eliminated first from the probable causes. The following plan was adopted:REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 29 II. The results of the serological examinations were as follows. A series of 73 specimens of sera of patients who had recovered from gastro-enteritis was tested against strain 1,340 (a true Flexner isolated from a convalescent case of gastro enteritis who never had dysentery before). 34 gave 1/200 positive agglutination microscopic 16 " 1/100 do. 10 " 1/50 do. 6 " 1/25 7 " 1 /25 negative do.

No. 116-P.H., 15th January 1925 King Institute2 No. 116-P.H., 15TH JANUARY 1925 appointed in July 1923 to examine the whole question submitted a comprehensive programme of works arranged in the order of urgency; the programme was generally approved by the Government and plans and estimates for some of the very urgent works have been got ready. 7. Mention was made in the last year's review that the question of maintaining the accounts of the Institute on a commercial basis was under consideration. The revised system of accounts submitted by Messrs. Fraser & Ross for the purpose was examined and it was found that the amount of labour and extra cost involved, in adopting it would be incommensurate with the results achieved and that there was no guarantee of greater accuracy in the system of costing than in the existing system of accounts. The Government have therefore, on the recommendation of the Accountant-General, decided that no alteration in the existing system is necessary and that it will be sufficient if the details of total expenditure of the institute shown in the financial statement appended to the annual report are supplemented by the inclusion of certain indirect charges which have hitherto been omitted from the statement. 8. A special officer appointed by the Government conducted a thorough investigation into the contingent expenditure of the Institute. Orders on this report have issued in G.O. No. 1696-P.H., dated 20th November 1924. 9. The scheme of travelling laboratories for the examination of water-supply at railway stations in the Presidency has been dropped for the present. The question of appointing a travelling inspectorate for the examination of water- supplies in the Presidency is under the consideration of the Government and the question of provision of funds for experiments on sewage disposal plant at the Engineering College, Guindy, is being considered in connexion with the budget proposals for 1925-26. 10. The Institute as usual rendered useful assistance to other departments. The staff of the Institute took an active part in public health propaganda by preparing the material issued by the Madras Health Council for the Health and Baby Week in January 1924 and by delivering lectures. 11. The Government congratulate Lt.-Col. J. Cunningham and his staff on the excellent achievements of the year and on the high standard of efficiency maintained in the Institute.

ScientificREPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, GUINDY, FOR THE YEAR 1924-25. INTRODUCTION. The King Institute functions as:2 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY Civil Assistant Surgeon M. K. Ramaswami Ayyar, who was on reserve duty at the Institute, was sent to Olavakot in charge of the Malaria unit from 8th. March to 7th September 1924. After the completion of the malarial work he was transferred to South Arcot district. Military Assistant Surgeon H. M. Lafrenais, I.M.D., who was transferred from the Pasteur Institute of Southern India, Coonoor, worked here from 25th May 1924 until 30th June 1924 when he was transferred to Bombay Bacteriological Laboratory. Government in their G.O. Mis. No. 289, P.H., dated 6th February 1925, declared the Senior Chemical Assistant and the Senior Bacteriological Assistant of this Institute to be gazetted officers for all purposes, includ- ing those of audit.

The financial statement for the year under review is supplemented by the inclusion of indirect charges as per G.O. No. 1144, P.H., dated 13th August 1924. They are shown in detail in statement No. 3. The total earning capacity of the Institute for the present year is estimated at Rs. 5,05,330, and the total expenditure including indirect charges amounts to Rs. 3,03,135, thus leaving an estimated net profit on the year's working of Rs. 2,02,195. This figure is in excess of that for the previous year, and shows that the Institute has earned a handsome profit for Government during the year. In an Institute of this kind, it is impossible to assign monetary value to the various kinds of work that is being carried out. The work of the investigation units in connexion with malaria, relapsing fever and other diseases, and the results of experiments for improving the potency of the vaccine lymph, with the resulting saving of life and expenditure to Government, can never be shown on paper in money value. If this could be done, the Institute could undoubtedly claim a very much higher profit on the year's working than the figure shown above. IV. SCIENTIFIC. (i) VACCINE SECTION. (a) Seed lymph.6 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY The excess of 5,485 is due to the excess of 1,221 revaccinations shown in the Nilgiris and 4,264 in Madras.

The best results have been attained in the following districts:8 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY Institute for the past three years. As a result of these experiments sufficient evidence has now been collected to make a definite pronounce- ment on the subject, and the result of the experimental work has been reported to Government in this office letter Cur. No. 4218 of 1924. It is not possible to give a detailed description of the various experiments that have been carried out in this Institute as it would take up too much space in this report, but a summary of the experiments and the conclusions arrived at is given below:REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 9 villages in the Saidapet range should be placed under the immediate control of the Director of the King Institute as a "model vaccination range" where the Director with his own trained permanent staff of vaccinators and Inspectors and with his constant personal supervision and that of the Assistant Director, can have the efficacy of the vaccine. lymph turned out by the Institute tested whenever required, and this work watched and carried out under ideal conditions.

One inmate who was found to be a carrier was segregated, and as a further preventive measure the rest were inoculated with mixed T.A.B. vaccine. (4) A case of acute purulent peritonitis as a sequela after an attack of pneumonia, was investigated, with the detection of pneumococcus type II in the pus. (5) Lange's Goldsol test has now been added to the other routine tests that are carried out in this Institute. The examination of cerebro- spinal fluid with this test gives an important clue to the Superintendents of Lunatic Asylums in distinguishing the different types of psychiatrical diseases. (6) A curious fungating tumour of the eye, and some concretions from the lachrymal duct were sent by Major R. E. Wright, I.M.S., from the Government Ophthalmic Hospital and were investigated bacterio- logically. A streptothrix was cultivated from the latter specimen and a hyphomycetes from the tumour. (7) An interesting case of mycetoma occurring in the stump of an old amputated thigh was investigated, and a streptothrix which forms a red pigment has been isolated, and is being studied. (c) Anti-sera.12 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY be incurred in the purchase of stores and apparatus for the use of the Public Analyst. The number of samples of water examined during the year was 1,221 (statement No. 14), an increase of 10 per cent over last year's figure. The half-yearly routine examination of protected municipal, jail and railway station supplies yielded 665 samples, an increase of 50 per cent over the previous year. The experimental filters at Guindy accounted for 392 samples, an increase of about 35 per cent. One hundred and sixty-four samples were examined for the Madras Corporation. There was a decrease of about 200 samples under this heading, as a result of the Corporation now getting their analytical work done by their Analyst who was trained at the King Institute. In spite of this decline, the total number of samples examined shows an increase, and the institute is now free to devote greater time and attention to research work and to mufassal water-supplies. The following is a review of the various protected water-supplies in the Presidency:13 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY water-supply to Bezwada was of fair quality but the presence of free ammonia in undesirably large quantities in the samples drawn from the collecting well at the head works would suggest the necessity for carrying out a detailed local investigation with a view to detecting any possible sources of pollution. The Conjeeveram water-supply which enjoyed a reputation for purity for a long time, showed deterioration in October 1924. There was great scarcity for water at Cuddapah owing to a failure of the monsoons and the supply was of poor quality. The galleries at Dindigul, Gunt14 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY scanty and unsatisfactory and the necessity for tapping a new source was again urged. Systematic chlorination of the other three railway station supplies referred to above was advocated. In this connexion, it appears necessary to invite the attention of Government to the advisability of adding, to the list of railway stations now being examined, several important railway junctions and other stations where there is an incessant influx of passengers throughout the year; a list of these was furnished as an enclosure to this office letter R.C. No. 2840-12 B, dated 19th December 1917, which elicited G.O. No. 1006 L., dated 3rd August 1918. This order restricted the number of railway stations in the first instance to 17 (vide appendix to the Government Order quoted). As a result of the experience gained during the six years during which the present scheme of periodical examinations has been in force, it may be stated that the time has come when the water-supply to other important stations should, in the interests of public health, be brought under scrutiny. Government will, therefore, be pleased to consider this question. (iv) COMMITTEE ON WATER FILTRATION. (1) Mr. Herbert Hawley, M.Sc., F.I.C., Public Analyst, was appointed a member of the Committee in G.O. No. 1932, P.H., dated 18th December 1924. Mr. J. W. Madeley ceased to be a member, on his ceasing to be the Special Engineer of the Corporation of Madras.

It is hoped that by using this method, a much higher rate than 4 inches vertical per hour can be achieved without impairing the efficiency of the filtrate. A waiting programme includes several other lines of experimentation to be taken up in order of utility and expediency. The scheme of a travelling railway laboratory for examining railway water-supplies recommended by the Committee, has been ordered by Government to be dropped for the present. Orders of Government are awaited for:16 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY (3) Kala-azar investigation at Kayalpatnam.REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 17 disposal of the unit the services of a lady Sub-Assistant Surgeon, Miss Pushpam Aaron, for examining the gosha women as well as for collecting the various kinds of biting insects from their rooms.

The members of the Institute staff also took an active part in the celebrations by delivering lectures on public health subjects at various centres. A health drama was organized by Mr. T. N. S. Raghavachari, Senior Bacteriological Assistant, and enacted on two occasions at Madras under the patronage of the Viscountess Goschen and the Hon'ble the Raja of Panagal, respectively. VII. RESEARCH WORK. Much of the work already referred to in the body of the report may be properly described as research work. 1. The experiments in connexion with the purification of vaccine lymph and other problems have been described in the section dealing with the subject. Further experimental work is still in progress. 2. Summaries of the work of the various investigation units will be found in the body of the report under section IV (v). These reports are too bulky to be included as appendices but will be published in due course in scientific journals. 3. The investigation into the various aspects of relapsing fever, which was commenced last year by Col. Cunningham has been continued on the lines laid down by him. Preliminary immunisation experiments with a spirochætal vaccine have been carried out in animals, with a view to study the phenomena of relapses and the role played by various types of spirochætes in the cycle of relapses with a close application of serological methods. These results will be published in due course. 4. An investigation was carried out at the instance of Major Wright, I.M.S., Superintendent, Government Ophthalmic Hospital, Madras, to ascertain the bacteriology of corneal ulcers with special reference to pneumococcus and the type to which it belongs. Seventy- five cases were examined in 28 of which (i.e., 37 per cent of the cases) pneumococcus was isolated. Out of these 28 positive cases, 22 or 78 per cent belonged to type IV. 5. This Institute also co-operated with Major Wright in conducting some experimental work on Trachoma in monkeys and rabbits. The results were negative. 6. The presence of a disease like modified smallpox was brought to the notice of the Director of this Institute by the Health Officer of the Corporation of Madras. By clinical examination of the cases it was possible to confirm the diagnosis of "Alastrim" and a short memorandum has been drawn up by the Director describing the signs and symptoms of this disease. Copies of this memorandum have been circulated by the Director of Public Health among the District Health Officers, for enabling them to distinguish alastrim from smallpox. The material collected from alastrim cases is being experimented with and studied in the Institute; the results will be published in due course. 7. The investigation into the differentiation of lactose fermenters in water, soil and other situations on the basis of their biochemical activities, has not been concluded. 8. A detailed investigation into the technique of testing disinfectants for their carbolic co-efficients was undertaken, as there was a considerable amount of variation in the results obtained in different laboratories and by different workers on the same disinfectant. The work is nearing completion. 9. The Municipality of Palacole in the Kistna district desired to introduce a protected water-supply to their town and there was a conflict of opinion as to the best method of purification that should be employed 6
22 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY to render the water of the Narasapur canal safe for drinking purposes. The Director of the King Institute gave it as his opinion that the safest and most economical means of deciding the question would be to carry out a systematic investigation of the scheme so as to cover all the changing conditions of the canal water, extending over one full year. Government accepting this suggestion directed in G.O. No. 848 P.H., dated 28th May 1923, that the Director, King Institute, should carry out experi- ments on the best method of purifying the water of the Narasapur canal. A sum of Rs. 500 was allotted by the municipality for conducting the investigation. Samples were collected at different seasons of the year and field tests carried out on the spot by Mr. N. S. Narayana Ayyangar one of the Laboratory Assistants, who was deputed with special instructions. Finally in November 1925, M.R.Ry. T. N. S. Raghavachari Avargal, Senior Bacteriological Assistant, proceeded to Palacole to complete the investi- gation by means of an extended series of tests with special reference to the extent and nature of contamination of the source. The results of the investigation together with his recommendations and approximate cost of the best method of purifying the canal water, were embodied in a report by the investigating officer, submitted to the Personal Assistant to the Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras with this office letter R.C. No. 577-751/B, dated 29th November 1924. 10. The King Institute was represented by Dr. C. G. Pandit at the twelfth meeting of the Indian Science Congress held at Benares in January 1925, at which the following papers were presented by the members of the staff at the section for Medical Research:23 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY IX. CONCLUSION. The King Institute is the premier laboratory for the Presidency of Madras, and the whole of Southern India relies upon it for bacteriological and serological diagnostic work, the manufacture and supply of vaccine lymph, prophylactic and curative vaccines and sera, and for expert advice in connexion with infectious and epidemic diseases. It is of paramount importance therefore that its laboratories should be thoroughly up-to-date and well-equipped in every branch of preventive medicine and public health work. The epidemiology of most infectious diseases in the tropics is intima- tely connected with various kinds of insects, biting as well as non-biting, the study of which in consequence, now forms an important branch of preventive medicine. Some of these insects act as carriers of infection by simple transference of the virus, as in the typhoid fevers and cholera, while in other diseases such as malaria and elephantiasis, it is essential that the virus, which stands much higher in the zoological scale, must undergo profound changes within the bodies of certain biting insects, before it can become infective to human beings. There are yet other insects, which simply inject the virus through their bites, e.g., the rat-flea, conveying plague from an infected rat, or the louse spreading relapsing fever from infected human beings to the healthy. In such epidemic diseases, therefore, the problem of prevention also involves the problems of the prevention of breeding and multiplication of the various insects concerned. From the public health point of view these problems assume a very great importance; they can only be solved by an expert Entomologist fully acquainted with the bionomics of insects. Similarly, worms are the cause of much suffering which has not yet been fully realized. Apart from the common intestinal worms such as the round-worm and the thread-worm which often produce very grave symptoms, there are a number of others whose life history is as yet but imperfectly known, and which cause ill-effects on the human hosts some- times of an extremely serious nature. The hook-worm, for example, which is prevalent on a very large scale in this Presidency, causes a disease which under certain conditions in some countries, has "veritably overwhelmed the birth rate and threatened the very existence of the race." Other worms infest other parts of the human body. Thus elephantiasis which is also extremely common in some parts of the Presidency, is a chronic disease caused by a worm injected through the bite of the culex mosquito; while the Guinea-worm disease in which the infection takes place through drinking water containing infected cyclops (a kind of water-flea), has been known to cause such grave inflammatory swellings and abscesses as to incapacitate the inhabitants of villages in the infected areas, and seriously hamper all agricultural operations. Bilharzial disease, cases of which have been lately imported into India from Egypt and adjoining countries, where it is very common, needs to be carefully watched; it produces severe lesions of extreme chronicity, which, when complicated by septic changes, are apt to become incurable. Besides these few examples, there are many other worms which are conveyed through the common domestic animals, and which gravely interfere with the well-being of the human population. It is essential therefore, to study the life histories of these worms and devise means for preventing the infection. In most laboratories this work is entrusted to expert Helminthologists. In addition to the above, there are certain protozoal organisms which are also concerned in the causation of epidemics of malaria and other fevers, amoebic dysentery, kala-azar, relapsing fever, infectious jaundice, rat-bite fever, tick fever and diarrh24 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY It is very essential therefore that the King Institute should be fully equipped for the study, investigation and prevention of epidemics of this nature. The vaccine lymph prepared in the Institute has now been brought to, a very high degree of potency, after prolonged research work carried out under great difficulties. Yet, it cannot be said that even at present, the process of manufacture is being carried out under bacteriologically ideal conditions. The various existing defects have already been pointed. out in the body of this report. The operating room and adjuncts should be as carefully designed and equipped as the operating rooms and laboratories of any of the modern hospitals. The newly designed vaccine block will obviate these defects, and the writer of this report, from his practical experience of several years in designing and equipping laboratories and hospitals, can confidently say that the design meets all the latest require- ments. It is to be hoped that there will be no further delay in taking this work in hand. In the bacteriological department, the work of preparing stock and autogenous vaccines is carried out in the same room where the microscopic as well as the cultural examination of faeces is conducted. The staining and examination of blood slides, the technique of widal diagnosis, the test for Wassermann reaction, and the operations for the preparation of high titre sera, are all carried out also in the same room. From a bacteriological point of view it is extremely dangerous to crowd all these sections into one room; serious contamination accidents are likely to occur under such conditions, and it is hoped therefore that the scheme, put forward for increasing the laboratory accommodation will be carried out as early as possible. In spite of these inconveniences and difficulties the staff of the Institute has devoted, in addition to the large amount of the daily routine Work much time to original research, and interesting experiments are in progress in connexion with relapsing fever, vaccinial immunity, viruses of vaccinia, smallpox and alastrim, and the significance of lactose fermenters in water and other situations in relation to their bearing on public health. The Public Analyst has had to work under considerable difficulties for a long time owing to want of equipment and suitable laboratory accommodation. The work of the Public Health section in looking after the protected water-supplies for Municipalities, Jails and Railway stations was most valuable and if the various recommendations made by the Institute as regards these supplies were only carried out by the bodies concerned there would be a great reduction of water-borne epidemics. The suggestion for the inclusion of more railway stations for regular examination of their water-supplies, should prove a very helpful measure in the matter of the maintenance of public health, and the scheme for the provision of a Travelling Inspectorate, of the greatest benefit to the whole Presidency. In the matter of research work, the King Institute cannot be said to be specially well-equipped. Unlike the other laboratories in India, it has no special research workers on its staff, its laboratory accommodation is insufficient and the reference library, inadequate; and if the premier laboratory for Southern India is to be brought to the level of the high standard of a Research Institute, it must be provided with a staff of expert research workers in Entomology, Helminthology, and Protozoology, three most important branches of preventive medicine, with suitable laboratory accommodation and a complete library of literature for reference. The King Institute has hitherto not only paid its way but brought handsome profit to Government, and it is but right that Government should help it now with the necessary funds for enlarging its share of
25 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY activities and making it still more useful in the matter of prevention of epidemic diseases, reducing the suffering, and diminishing the death rate of the population of this Presidency from preventible diseases. Finally, before concluding this review, the Director has much pleasure in placing on record the hearty co-operation and the loyal support of all the members of the staff in bringing about a satisfactory record of progress and in helping to bring the King Institute to its present standard of efficiency. The Public Analyst desires to mention his appreciation of the assistance of the Chemical Assistants Messrs. M. Parameswara Ayyar and K.V. Sundaram and of the keen interest they have taken in his food- analysis work. KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY, 18th August 1925. D. A. TURKHUD, M.B., C.M. (EDIN.), Acting Director.

The proposal to form three new research sections (Protozoological, Helminthological and Entomological sections) in the Institute has had to be deferred for the present, as the Indian Research Fund Association were not prepared to meet any portion of the cost. 9. On the recommendation of the Committee on Water Filtration, the Government sanctioned during the year the permanent retention of the experimental Filter Installation at Guindy. The scheme for the creation of a Travelling Inspectorate for the more efficient and rapid control of the municipal water- supplies in the Presidency has been deferred until the question of appointing a Mechanical Engineer to Government has been decided. In G.O. No. 728 W., dated 1st June 1925, the Government sanctioned proposals for carrying out experiments on sewage purification at the Engineering College, Guindy, up to the end of the current year. The question of continuing the experiments for another year is under consideration. 10. The works for the supply of electricity to the Institute from the power house at the Engineering College, Guindy, are nearing completion. The re-arrangement of the bacteriological buildings and the improvement of the laboratory fittings and of the electric supply to the Institute is engaging the attention of the Government. 11. The question of supplementing the list of railway stations, samples of water from which are being analysed at the King Institute, is under the consideration of the Government. 12. The Government are glad to note the valuable work done and the high standard of efficiency maintained by the Institute during the year.

A recent analysis of the results for the last three years in all districts suggests, that the best off-season would be March to June for all districts except the southern districts of TrichinoREPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 5 issue from cold store, and this deterioration is diminished when only a few cases have to be done, because then the vaccine is used up on the first day. It is to be noted that April's figures for numbers vaccinated distinctly exceeded those of the other off-season months. The district success rates are given in Table V. The Nilgiris have the best results with a case success rate of 99.7. Good results were obtained by Madras (99.1), Chittoor (99) and Malabar (98.9). In the following districts the case success rate is below 95 per cent:6 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 2.

The filter worked for three months in this way which makes the second period. In the third period of two months, the percolating filter bed has been the same as that of an ordinary sand filter but of course the former has not been submerged. Distribution has been maintained by a perforated corrugated iron sheet about 6 inches above the surface of the sand. The filter has been similarly worked in a fourth period except that the water has been sprayed above the perforated zinc sheet.

From his long experience of twenty-three years in the manufacture of vaccine lymph, the services of Khan Sahib Muhammad Oomar Sahib Bahadur have been exceptionally valuable in the output of vaccine lymph and in the maintenance of its potency. Alterations to the main buildings to provide more and better laboratories and the construction of a new vaccine lymph operation block are on the way, so that in a year or two the facilities for work should be ample. In my opinion what the Institute most needs is a Second Assistant Director who will be an entomologist and malarialogist. Malaria and Filariasis two great diseases of Southern India that call for further research and surveys, in addition to such less common diseases as kala-azar and relapsing fever, would provide more than enough work to occupy his time. Further the coming of another Assistant Director would relieve the Director of a great deal of supervisory work and of some office work, and thus help to give him, what at present he obtains with the greatest difficulty, a little time for direct research.

HERBERT HAWLEY, M.SC., F.I.C., PUBLIC ANALYST WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS, ON FOOD STANDARDS UNDER THE MADRAS PREVENTION OF ADULTERATION ACT, 1918. General. On my arrival in Madras in January 1924, I was instructed by the Surgeon-General that I was to work at the King Institute, Guindy, and that my first task would be the carrying out of such work as I might consider necessary, to enable me to recommend food standards for adoption under the Madras Prevention of Adulteration Act, 1918, more especially standards for milk and milk-products. I found that the King Institute was not equipped for food-analysis, and that with the apparatus and chemicals in stock very little could be done. Accordingly I prepared an indent including such apparatus as I considered essential. Special facilities were given by Govern- ment to enable me to get my equipment as quickly as possible, my indent being passed on, and permission being given for orders to be submitted direct to the firms concerned. Most of the apparatus and chemicals had arrived by the end of August, and though my laboratory was only finished in 1925, a certain amount of bench room was found for me, and from that date a regular supply of samples have been analysed. While awaiting my equipment, I made a survey of the problem and examined such published figures as were available in respect to analyses of food-stuffs in India and more particularly in Madras. The literature on the subject is very scanty. A considerable number of analyses of buffalo milk are available, and a much smaller number of analyses of cow milk. There is very little literature indeed as to the composition of butter and the chemical constants of butter-fat. It appeared that a considerable number of samples of cow milk would have to be examined, both during the monsoon and at other seasons, and that butter and butter-fat in Madras would need to be thoroughly investigated. This has been done, and I am now in a position to recommend a series of standards for milk and milk-products for official adoption under the Act. Before coming to India I had a very considerable experience of the working of the Food and Drugs Acts in England, first as assistant to the Public Analyst for the Borough of Portsmouth, then for nine years an assistant to the Public Analyst for the City of Birmin- gham, and finally for nearly four years as Public Analyst for the Metropolitan Borough for Stepney. It is my carefully considered opinion that the Madras Food Adulteration Act is in some respects faulty and I would suggest that now is the time for the passing of a short amending Act, so that food adulteration in Madras may be dealt with thoroughly from the start. With the Madras Act as it stands, Madras is in the position of England after the passage of the Food and Drugs Amendment Act of 1899, but it is not in a position to deal with the sophistication of food-stuffs as it is dealt with in England at the present moment. The Madras Prevention of Adulteration Act, 1918.* The Madras Prevention of Adulteration Act, 1918, is based on the English Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 and 1899. In drafting the Madras Act it appears to me that a very important consideration has been lost sight of. In England no regulations have been made under the Food and Drugs Acts since 1902, as it has been found difficult to use these Acts in making regulations prohibiting or limiting the addition of colouring matters, preservatives or other substances, however undesirable, where such addition has become a trade custom. Such regulations are now always made under the Public Health Acts. The difficulty with the English Food and Drugs Acts, which will arise in connexion with the Madras Act, which is similarly worded, was that the standards to be prescribed were only allowed to "raise a presumption until the contrary is proved" that the sample was not genuine by reason of the fact that it did not subscribe to the official standards. In * The Act is reprinted in full in Appendix A. 9
32 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY the case of food-stuffs of naturally varying composition such as milk this gives satisfactory powers for dealing with such adulterations as skimming or watering, and protects a milk vendor owning a cow which yields milk of abnormal composition. But the powers given are insufficient when it comes to laying down regulations, prohibiting or limiting the addition of substances which may be considered undesirable, as the vendor can counter the presumption of adulteration by proving a "custom of the trade," either generally or in a particular locality. This means that varying decisions would be given by magistrates according to the weight of evidence brought before them, it further means that local authorities have to go to the expense and trouble of bringing expert evidence to contest a defendant's claims. The same difficulty will arise should Government decide, as I very strongly recommend to prohibit the sale of watered milk. The standards which I propose below can deal with the sale of watered milk as milk, but it appears very possible that some vendors may attempt to sell watered milk with a declaration to the effect that it is not sold as genuine milk. The Act as it stands could not prevent this. The sale of watered milk either with or without notice was totally prohibited in England, under the Public Health Act Regulations until recently, it is now prohibited under the new Milk and Dairies (Amendment) Act, 1922. I consider that a prohibition of the addition of water to milk is even more necessary in India where water- borne disease is of fairly common occurrence. A further point with which the Act as it stands could not deal is in connexion with the sale of "fore-milk" (the calf being allowed to take the last and richest portions of the milk) as "milk," in cases where a vendor establishes a plea of "custom of the trade." I deal further with this point below. The recent regulations made in England for regulating the sale of condensed milk and dried milk are of immense importance in connexion with infant welfare, defining as they do preparations made from full-cream milk and skimmed milk and prescribing labels in the case of the skimmed milk products stating that such foods are "unfit for babies." I consider that similar regulations in Madras might be of great value but that under the present Act they could not be made. I suggest later amendments to the Madras Act, by which it might be made to combine the functions of both the Food and Drugs Acts and the Public Health Acts (so far as they concern food adulteration) in England. The amendments would, in my opinion, enable Government to take powers which I consider necessary if adulteration of foods in the Madras Presidency is to be dealt with on modern lines. A committee on preservatives in foods in England has recently presented a report to the Ministry of Health with draft regulations, the intention being that all the numerous existing regulations shall be repealed and the whole subject dealt with in one consolidated order. When these regulations are finally approved under the Public Health Acts, I consider that it is very desirable that Madras should be in a position to adopt similar regulations at once, otherwise there will be a very considerable probability that food-stuffs held in stock in England, which the new regulations render unsaleable, will be shipped to countries where similar regulations are not in force. The published draft regulations suggest a very con- siderable tightening of the control over the addition of preservatives or colouring matters. A further desirable amendment is the inclusion of the words "or other food" after "cheese" in sections 5 (d) and 20 (e). At present there is no authority for the fixing of standards for substances of naturally varying composition other than milk, cream, butter, ghee and cheese. Government have already been approached to fix standards for tea on similar lines to those made under the Bengal Food Adulteration Act, 1918, and later it may appear desirable to fix standards for other foods such as coffee. Substances which are not of varying composition do not require a standard and can be dealt with under section 5 (1) (a) which corresponds to section (6) of the English Act of 1875. A further amendment is necessary to enable sample-takers to add a preservative to milk samples, otherwise there is a possibility, particularly in the case of samples sent from a distance, that the sample bottle may burst en route or that on arrival at the Analyst's labor- atory it may be too badly decomposed for an analysis to be possible. Powers to make such an addition have been taken by the Government of Bengal in their regulations under their Food Adulteration Act but I am of opinion that under the Madras Act as it stands at present, any such regulation would be ultra vires. On the other hand should a sample taker add a preservative without legal authority I consider that the vendor might plead that the sample as analysed by the public Analyst was not as sold by him, and might get a dismissal of his case on the technical point. Milk standards. It is necessary to fix two standards for milk, viz., a standard for fat, and a standard for solids-not-fat. Solids-not-fat are in solution in milk. They do not separate on standing and cannot be removed by mechanical means. Accordingly a deficiency of solids-not-fat
REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 33 below the standard fixed as the minimum percentage which is likely to occur in genuine milk, points to the addition of water. Fat of course separates as cream on standing. A deficiency of fat may accordingly, be due, either to watering which lowers the percentage of fat as well as that of solids-not-fat, or to skimming, or, what comes to the same thing to the addition of skimmed or separated milk. An analyst decides from the percentage of solids-not-fat whether a sample of milk is watered, and when there is a deficiency of fat exceeding that of the deficiency of solids-not-fat or when the latter is the only deficiency he will certify that a sample is not genuine by reason of a portion of the cream having been removed. A large number of samples (318) of milk taken from individual cows at the various Madras Hospitals have been examined. Also numerous samples from the Agricultural Dairy Farm at Coimbatore and from the Military Dairy at Bangalore. The only official standards in India are those of the Bengal Government who have adopted standards of 3.5 per cent of fat and 8.5 per cent of solids-not-fat for cows milk. I recommend that the English standards of 3.0 per cent of fat and 8.5 per cent of solids-not- fat be adopted for Madras. Samples were taken before and after and during the monsoon (taken as the month of November in 1924). The average figures obtained were:34 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY prohibit it totally on the first introduction of the Act but I suggest that it would be a step in the right direction if a definition. of milk were given in clause 2 of the Food Adulteration. Act such as to prevent fore-milk being sold as milk-while allowing the sale of after milk. In the Bengal Regulations, milk is defined as the secretion obtained by completely milking the udder, but I think that the definition which I suggest in appendix A could be enforced in Madras, whereas a definition requiring a very drastic change in the habits of the milkers might prove unworkable. The average fat content of the whole of the samples taken from individual cows was 4.16 per cent. The lowest average was 3.41 per cent, for morning milk during the monsoon, the highest 4.60 per cent for the evening milk during the pre-monsoon period. These averages, it will be seen from Appendix B, are made up from samples with a very varying fat content. But I regard both excessively low and excessively high figures as due to the calf having taken either mainly after-milk or mainly fore-milk respectively. Twenty samples (6.3 per cent of the whole) gave percentages of fat below 3.0 per cent, most of these being morning milks taken during the monsoon, when 14 out of 50 samples (28 per cent of the whole) gave figures varying from 1.9 to 2.9. It is my considered opinion that the adoption of any standard below 3.0 per cent would lead to the sale of a large amount of partially skimmed milk, but that if the standard of 3.0 per cent be adopted, the local authorities concerned should be advised to exercise caution in taking proceedings for samples of morning milk slightly deficient in fat, during the monsoon, or there will be a risk of the vendors satisfying the court that their milk is genuine. I regard. the Bengal standard of 3.5 per cent as too high for Madras. Such a standard would mean the condemnation of 28 per cent of the whole of my morning samples and of 56 per cent of the morning samples taken during the monsoon. (See Appendix B.) In a tropical climate it will occasionally happen with ordinary samples and very frequently with the third portion of the sample which is reserved for reference, that the sample will be so badly decomposed as to make it impossible for the Analyst to determine the proportion of solids-not-fat in the original sample. N.B.REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 35 lenient one, more lenient than that adopted for cow's milk as I have only examined one sample which gave a lower figure (one sample gave 8.8 per cent). I consider, however, that it would be undesirable to adopt a higher limit than that in force in Bengal, as with such a limit the Bengal standard would almost certainly be quoted in the courts which might lead to the courts getting the impression that the Madras standards were somewhat over-stringent with a consequent imposition of trifling penalties. I consider that it is most essential that magis- trates shall have full confidence in the reasonableness of the standards which are adopted, so that they may impose heavy penalties, without any fear of there being a miscarriage of justice. Much of the milk in Madras is milked under very dirty conditions and I think that there should be a limit for the amount of dirt which may reasonably be present. In England there is no official limit, each public analyst decides on what he considers a reasonable stand- ard and must convince the court that a purchaser, getting milk containing an amount of dirt in excess of this figure, is prejudiced. This means that different magistrates accept different limits, and the verdicts in the courts have been somewhat conflicting. The most usually accepted standard is a maximum of two parts per 100.000 of sediment, both milk and sediment being measured by volume. This limit is a reasonable one for England but it would I think be too stringent for India and I suggest that a limit of five parts per 100,000 be adopted, in spite of the fact that there have been numerous convictions in England for amounts between two and five parts. But I would suggest that should this standard be adopted, it should be stated in any preamble or circular accompanying the regulations that the figure is tentative, and that it is anticipated that the limit will be reduced later. In this connexion I might mention that this limit would, normally, only come into operation in the case of samples taken from large consignments, as a pint of milk is usually required for the estimation of dirt, which would mean that the original sample which was divided into three parts would have to be at least three pints, a prohibitively large amount for routine sampling of small milk-vendors. Four samples of milk from the Military Dairy at Bangalore have been examined for dirt. The amounts found (parts per 100,000) were 1.5, 5.0, 5.0, and 7.5, respectively. Four samples of bulked Madras milk as supplied to one of the hospitals contained 70, 15, 17 and 30, parts respectively, distinct particles of cowdung, being identified in each case. I see no excuse for milk being supplied in such a filthy condition, and though I am aware that the limit I suggest would condemn the great bulk of the milk in Madras, I suggest that the fact that milk satisfying this standard is obtained at the Bangalore Dairy proves it to be a reasonable one. At Bangalore the precautions taken to obtain clean milk are quite simple consisting simply of a proper washing of the cow and the milkers hands and of insistance on the milker milking with dry hands. Butter, ghee and cheese standards. The Act defines those foods as follows:- "Butter" and "Cheese" mean respectively butter and cheese made exclusively from milk or cream or both, with or without the addition of salt or other innocuous preservative or of innocous colouring matter. "Ghee" means ghee prepared exclusively from butter made from cow's or buffalo's milk or cream or both. As regards cheese the only standard which can be prescribed is that it shall conform to the definition of cheese above and shall be cheese made exclusively from milk or cream, unless labelled and sold otherwise in accordance with the regulations to be made under section 20 (d). In connexion with butter the limits to be prescribed are for moisture and preservative. As regards preservative, I have mentioned above that the whole question of preservatives and colouring matter in foods other than milk (which has already been dealt with by complete prohibition) is under consideration in England, and I would strongly recommend that no standards be adopted in Madras till the regulations in England are finally approved and passed, and that then they be adopted immediately and in toto under the Madras Act. These new regulations will be based on the report of a very carefully selected committee who have heard an enormous amount of evidence from doctors, chemists and representatives of the trades concerned and should be beyond criticism. If the amendments to the Act which I suggest be adopted it would be possible for Madras to adopt the same regulations which will deal not only with the question of preservatives in butter but with the whole question of preservatives and colouring matter in food-stuffs generally. As regards moisture I suggest the adoption of a limit of 20 per cent. In England the limit is 16 per cent, and the average percentage considerably lower, but without the use of ice it is difficult to make butter with such a small moisture content, in Madras. 10
36 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY To test what could be done I visited the Agricultural Dairy at Coimbatore, where churning experiments were carried out for me under my supervision. Samples of butter were prepared both with and without the use of ice and I took samples at various stages of the churning for analysis. Using no ice the finished. butter made from buffalo milk cream contained. 15.5 per cent of moisture, from cow's milk cream 16.5 per cent. Six samples from Coimbatore Dairy, at other times, forwarded to me by post have contained. from 14.5 to 17.4 per cent of moisture, the higher percentages being always obtained in cow's butter which contains a softer fat than buffalo's butter. The samples prepared. for me without the use of ice were churned in the early morning (about 7 a.m.), the temperature in the churn being 77° F. It would probably be unreasonable to expect every small dairy to use ice, otherwise the English limit of 16 per cent might be adopted; but the figures that I have obtained show that working under the best conditions without ice a butter containing very little more moisture can be prepared. To allow for the fact that the technique of the churning at Coimbatore was probably a little better than that obtaining in the ordinary small dairy, I suggest that for the present a limit of 20 per cent be adopted. A proportion of water in excess of this will, in my opinion, be due either to deliberate over-churning, working at mid- day temperatures or insufficient working of the butter, any of which will cause an increased moisture content and an unduly large yield of butter. I have examined a number of samples of butter purchased casually in Madras. I have only found one sample with less than 20 per cent of water, this sample was from a small dairy and contained 19.8 per cent, other samples have contained. from 20.5 to 27.9 per cent (ten samples), one sample from a Madras dairy contained 57.5 per cent. Hence the adoption of a 20 per cent limit would involve considerable improvement, but I do not consider that dairies would find any real difficulty in producing a butter of this quality. Ghee is prepared by heating butter until all moisture has disappeared, and should contain no moisture whatever. I suggest that a 1 per cent limit be allowed for adventitious moisture, any moisture in excess of this amount will have been. fraudulently worked in. In England a 1 per cent limit was prescribed during the war for moisture in lard, which as a normally anhydrous fat corresponds in some respects to ghee in India. The natural standard for the fat in butter or ghee is the adoption of the definition given in the Act, i.e., it must be exclusively milk fat. In some countries so-called standards have been prescribed fixing limits to which certain analytical constants of the fat must subscribe. The authorities in England have always refused to countenance any such standard, and I most strongly recommend that the same policy be adopted in Madras. The figure which has been. mainly used is known to chemists as the Reichert number. Fats consist of a complex mixture of what are known as "glycerides." These are compounds of glycerine with certain organic acids known as the "fatty acids." There are a large number of these glycerides, one of which is the glyceride of butyric acid. It happens that butter is the only fat which contains this glyceride in any considerable proportion and the Reichert number is roughly proportional to the butyric acid present. At first sight it might appear that the fixing of a minimum Reichert number would be of assistance to the Analyst. The difficulty lies in the fact that although butter-fat is the only fat which gives a considerable Reichert figure, the value of this figure for genuine butters is very variable, the maximum figure being about double the minimum. In Europe most butters have a Reichert value lying between 25 and 33. In Madras I have obtained Reichert values below 15 (from butter made from the milk of a single cow in the General Hospital herd), while other butter-fats have given values of more than 30. Only four figures below 20 were obtained out of 81 determinations so that it might be suggested that a figure of 20 should be adopted as a minimum limit; this would, in my opinion., be extremely inadvisable. Should an Analyst obtain a Reichert value of 20, he would know, after the publication of this report, that the sample under examination might be genuine. On the other hand it might have been prepared by the adulteration of a sample of butter of high butyric content, thus it might consist of a mixture of 66 per cent of butter of a, Reichert value of 30 with 33 per cent of adulterant, such a mixture would yield a Reichert value of about 20. He would next proceed to apply tests for certain specific adulterants which are commonly used for adulteration and the presence of which is readily detected. He would further determine a number of other constants than the Reichert value and in spite of the sample having given a Reichert value consistent with the sample being genuine he might obtain figures which could not be given by genuine butter-fat. There are certain adulterants which could be added to a butter of high Reichert value and which could not at the present moment be detected, in such a case an Analyst must give the vendor the benefit of the doubt and pass the sample as genuine, but in the other cases mentioned the onus of proof should a standard Reichert value be adopted, would lie with the prosecution,
REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 37 the Analyst would probably have to be present in court, and a case which should be quite simple might become complicated and expensive, so much so that after a little experience of such cases some municipalities might refuse to go to the expense of bringing their Analyst a long distance to give evidence in a case in which the vendor might not be in a position to pay the costs in the event of a conviction. The simple certificate which. I was in the habit of using in England, which merely stated that the sample under examination contained a certain percentage of foreign fat (no analytical constants being given) leads to no such complications. I may summarise my views on this point by saying that, when a very low Reichert value is obtained (much below any standard which could possibly be fixed by law) this figure is in itself quite sufficient to condemn a sample of butter-fat, but that when a value near the border line is obtained an opinion can only be given by an Analyst with high qualifications and with a thorough experience in the analysis of oils and fats (probably the most difficult branch of analytical chemistry) and that he must be capable of carrying out accurately the determination of a considerable number of constants, of making tests for specific adulterants and of forming an opinion by the consideration. of the whole of his results. No analyst of any standing would ever condemn. a sample unless he were fully convinced of the presence of an adulterant and it goes without saying that the Act is only workable if the public analysts appointed under it are men whose qualifications are beyond criticism. In Bengal standard Reichert values have been. fixed of 24 for cow butter-fat and 30 for buffalo. I do not know on what results these figures were based, probably the animals in Bengal give very different figures to those in Madras. In Madras these limits would be quite unworkable. Fifty-two samples of cow's milk butter-fat have been examined. Twenty- five of these gave Reichert values below the Bengal limit of 24, four of these being below 20, the lowest value being 14.7. Of 29 samples of buffalo-milk butter-fat only two gave values which would enable them to be passed as genuine in Bengal, giving values between 30 and 31, the remainder giving values . varying from 23.0 to 29.7. The average value for cow's milk butter-fat was 23.1, for buffalo 26.7. After my draft regulations under clause 20 (e) I suggest draft regulations under 20 (d) "prescribing the manner in which notice of any addition, admixture or deficiency shall be given to the purchaser of any article of food." Here I am in some little difficulty. There are no such general regulations in England which I can use as a basis; separate regulations having been prescribed in connexion with different food-stuffs. Thus labelling regulations are laid down for margarine (butter substitute) in the Butter and Margarine Acts. Other regulations prescribing methods of giving notice of admixture occur in the Milk and Cream Regulations, Condensed Milk Regulations, Dried Milk Regulations, these being regulations made under the Public Health. Acts. As far as possible I have used these as a basis and my draft gives a general idea of the type of notice which. I consider desirable, but it will be necessary for the advice of some one fully conversant with Indian bazaars and retail shops to consider whether my suggested regulations would be applicable to Indian conditions, advice which I am not competent to give, and further it will be necessary to prescribe the languages in which the notices should be printed in the various districts of the Presidency. I would advise that the regulations should insist (as all the English regulations do) on all notices being printed.

PART I.2 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY been held here were rendered unnecessary and have now been discontinued except for a few practical demonstrations. Nine visits were made by batches of students from Colleges, schools, etc., during the year. The following medical men have attended the Institute for a month or more to acquire a practical training in bacteriological work:REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 3 PART II.4 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY Saidapet Range have been given. Most of these are done with cups already tested and in general use and so older. The general rates in Saidapet this year were 99.3 per cent. case success and 96.5 per cent. insertion success as against 99.3 and 97.3 last year. Further evidence on the potency of lymph as issued is given by an analysis of returns received from 87 individual cups of lymph issued for which full returns were available. Lymph from these cups was sent out on 14,000 different occasions to various vaccinators. 7,500 returns which include returns for each of the 87 cups gave a case success rate of 100 per cent. Therefore, the lack of complete success of the others cannot have been due to variation in the lymph as issued because elsewhere such cups gave 100 per cent. success rates.

The following supplies have been visited during the year under report:10 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GU1NDY The Disinfectants examined have yielded coefficients varying from 211 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY Institute and a bacteriological chemist Mr. N. Swaminathan was engaged and put in charge and worked under the Director. He has made more than 500 different analyses of the various effluents with the main intention of comparing the effluents from the different tanks. It was found that there was not enough sewage to regularly work the Imhoff tank so that the latter was worked only intermittently and falls out of the comparison. Sewage was passed through the tanks at the same rate as regards each other but at different rates in different periods, the time of stay in the tanks varied from 12 to 24 hours. The results show that whatever the rate of passing, there was practically no difference between the open and closed septic tanks as regards the amount of free ammonia present in the effluents. The average percentage reduction of albuminoid ammonia through- out the year in the closed tank was 41.95 and in the open tank 32.26. Thus the closed tank was definitely superior in this respect. As regards the oxygen absorbed as was to be expected, the open tank was a little the better but since this criterion is less important, we conclude that on the whole the closed septic tank was a little better than the open. (E) RESEARCH WORK. 1. Malarial survey of Udayagiri in Nellore District in April 1926 by an Investigation Unit in charge of Assistant Surgeon K. V. Krishnan. An extra- ordinary state of affairs was found. Almost every one of the inhabitants questioned gave a history of recent malaria. That these statements were true is shown by the fact that 96 per cent of the children in the main village had malaria parasites in their blood. The spleen rate was 54.4 per cent. The area was at the height of a very severe epidemic of malaria which had gone on increasing from the autumn of the previous year. Adult anophelines abounded. Though A. rossi was the commonest, yet malaria carrying species such as A. culicifacies and A. fuliginnosus, particularly the former, was almost as common. The infection rate in A. culicifacies and A. fuliginosus was as high as 10 per cent. The important breeding places of these carriers were wells, tanks, irrigation canals, and streams from the hill adjacent. The conditions here presented a strong contrast to the Mopad area, which is only 30 miles away and which had been surveyed in the previous month as reported on page 10 of last year12 RE PORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY Surgeon M. K. Ramaswami Ayyar went to Mopad in November 1926 which ordinarily is the period just after the north-east monsoon. But this year not only had the south-west monsoon from July to September been poor, but in October and November the north-east monsoonREPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GU1NDY 13 9.

High titre sera made from each strain gave cross agglutination reactions with all other strains. Work is being continued. This subject is very important in the light of some recent work which claims that atypical vibrios become pathogenic and produce cholera under certain conditions. No definite evidence on this point has yet been obtained here. 21.

These make heavy demands on the time of the Director, for not only is he consulted in and advise on every research, but many researches, particularly those in the field, entail much correspondence and many others have finally to be written up by him, further the researches suffer for lack of more personal atten- tion and visits in the field as could be given by, or with the help of, another Assistant Director. The next urgent need is for an Assistant Surgeon to be resident at the Institute and help the Director in supervising the general non-sectional work of the Institute, e.g., bacteriological stores, care of animals, control of the kitchen, cleaning of apparatus, etc., which demand bacteriological knowledge on the part of the assistant. A third very urgent need is the equipment of some of the present laboratories with suitable furniture and fittings. At present two of the main laboratories are without bacteriological benches and work has to be done on tables without gas or water laid on except at other chemical tables behind.

No. 2127, P.H., 27th October 1927 Administration Report2 No. 2127, P.H., 27TH OCTOBER 1927 increase in the number of Wassermann tests made is attributed partly to the investigation into the prevalence of venereal disease among the population carried out for the information of the Delegation of the British Social Hygiene Council. 5. The Public Analyst continued to control the chemical side of the work of the Public Health section of the Institute during the year. The Madras Preven- tion of Adulteration Act, 1918, has not yet been brought into force, and there was therefore no regular supply of food samples for analysis, but a number of such samples were examined in connexion with various investigations. The question of extending the Act to certain selected municipalities is engaging the attention of the Government, and it is hoped that during the next official year the Act will be in force in the most important towns in the Presidency. The results of treat- ing cancer with a preparation of lead which the Public Analyst has succeeded in stabilizing by a method not previously applied, may be of the greatest importance, and are awaited with interest. 6. The investigation units attached to the Institute continued to perform valuable work in connexion with malaria surveys and other special investigations. 7. In addition to the routine examination of samples of water obtained from the protected water-supplies in municipalities, an unusually large number of special investigations in connexion with water-supply were carried out in various parts of the Presidency during the year under report. A new arrangement was introduced during the year, under which only a general report on the examination of water-supplies was sent direct to the local bodies concerned, specific recom- mendations for the improvement of the water-works being sent to the Sanitary Engineer and the Director of Public Health in order to enable them to advise the authorities concerned as to the measures to be taken to rectify the defects brought to light. 8. The attention of the Inspector-General of Prisons is invited to the remarks made in the report on the impurity of the water-supply of all the jails except that at Rajahmundry. 9. In order to ensure that good drinking water is supplied to railway passengers the Government in 1918, on the recommendation of the Sanitary Commissioner, ordered that the water supplied at seventeen railway stations should be periodically analysed at the King Institute, and in April 1927 they accepted the Surgeon-GeneralNo. 2127, P.H., 27TH OCTOBER 1927 3 Kilpauk water-works. In April 1927 the Government sanctioned the proposal. Experiments were started at Kilpauk from 1st October 1927. 13. The Government are glad to record their appreciation of the efficient manner in which the Director and his staff have carried on the work of the Institute during the year and of the valuable assistance which has been rendered to other departments and the public by their investigations and researches.

The usual First-class Vaccinators' class was held for a fortnight in February and was attended by 65 students. Eight visits were made by batches of students from colleges and schools during the year. The following attended the Institute to acquire a practical training in branches of work here:REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 3 for the Wassermann test and of water samples and secondarily to a very large increase in the output of cholera vaccine. As usual, this statement does not include the financial value of the work done by investigation units or of any researches at the Institute, and so the large increase in the estimated net profit shows better than in any other way how great was the increase in the routine work of the Institute.

An auto-vaccine was made and administered which effected a cure. The organism was gram-negative, motile, and fermented glucose dulcite and mannite with the production of gas, but failed to ferment lactose sacharose and inulin. 10. From a case of acute pyelitis, another organism of the paratyphoid group was isolated which was agglutinated by the patient's serum (1 in 400), but which did not react to high titre serum of paratyphoid A, B or C. Although it fermented the same sugars as in No. 9 and was gram-negative and motile, yet serologically it was different, because it was not agglutinated by the serum of the other case. These two cases suggest that other paratyphoid. species D, E, etc., exist as has been suggested by other observers. 11. Succeeding each other, there were two fatal cases in a house at Saidapet. It was reported that each had developed a. sudden comatose condition with fits and asphyxia towards the end. After an investigation and an examination of the throats and nostrils of the members of the household, it was found out that one woman was a meningococcus carrier. She was segregated and treated. 12. From an acute case of meningitis from Royapetta Hospital, a pneumococcus was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. It was an organism of type III. 13. An uterus removed for probable malignant growth showed what appeared to be an extensive diffuse papilloma on the posterior wall which is a rare tumour in the uterus. From its wide extent and involvement of the deeper tissues it was judged wise to call it an adeno-carcinoma, although from its own structure it appeared to be a papilloma. 14. A portion of the lung of a cow in which tuberculosis was suspected after slaughter gave rather a puzzling section which was eventually diagnosed as a secondary chorion epithelioma. (D) & (E) PUBLIC HEALTH SECTION. The Public Analyst, Mr. Herbert Hawley, was in charge of the section till about the end of March, when he proceeded home on furlough leaving the bacteriological and chemical sub-sections in charge of Mr. Raghavachari and Mr. Parameswara Ayyar who have collaborated in writing this part of the report.

The demand for all other stock vaccines and parti- cularly of typhoid also increased. There was a fall in the supply of autogenous vaccines as the General Hospital made its own. The total number of specimens examined in the Institute also shows a decline, the number for the year under review being 24,619 against 29,377 in the previous year, though there was an increase in the number of Wassermann tests carried out from 13,824 to 16,070. 6. The Public Analyst continued to be in charge of the chemical side of the work of the Public Health section of the Institute till about the end of March 1928 when he proceeded home on leave leaving the bacteriological and chemical sub-sections in charge of his assistants. The Madras Prevention of Adulteration Act, 1918, has not yet been brought into force and there was therefore no regular supply of samples of food for analysis. The samples of foodstuffs analysed were mostly hospital tenders and only a few were from private sources. The question. of extending the Act to certain selected municipalities is still under the considera- tion of the Government and a final decision is pending return of Mr. Hawley, the Public Analyst, from leave. The Surgeon-General is requested to address Govern- ment separately on the proposal to fix a standard of purity for tea. 7. The investigation units attached to the Institute continued to perform valuable work in connexion with malaria surveys, a survey of filariasis and other special investigations. Details of the work of the investigation units will be published separately as a supplement to the annual report. 8. There was an increase in the number of samples of water examined during the year, especially under railway supplies. The new arrangement by which a general report is furnished to the local bodies concerned on the exami- nation of water-supplies and a special report containing specific recommendations to the Director of Public Health and the Sanitary Engineer was continued during the year and is reported to have worked well. The attention of the municipal councils concerned is invited to the remarks in the report on the results of the periodical examination of protected water-supplies and they are requested to take necessary steps to improve their quality. 9. The attention of the Inspector-General of Prisons is invited to the remarks in the report on the impurity of the water-supply of all the jails except that at Rajahmundry. Early steps should be taken to arrange for local investigations to determine the causes of the pollution of water in the wells of the several jails. 10.

Reports of the Sewage Analyst for the Water and Sewage Purification Com- mittee, 1926-27 and 1927-28SUPPLEMENT TO THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, GUINDY, FOR 1927-28. INTRODUCTION. Reports and papers that are of sufficient general importance are published by members in current medical journals. Occasionally other reports of investiga- tions carried out at the express wish of Government are published separately as Government orders. In addition to these two classes of reports, there are many other reports not of great general importance but of some local importance and of sufficient general importance to merit publication. Hitherto there has been no means of publishing such reports except as appendices to the Annual Report of the Institute. Accordingly Government were asked to allow the publication of a supplement to the Annual Report which they kindly sanctioned in G.O. No. 640, P.H., dated 20th March 1928. Hence the publication of this first supplement. It is intended to publish as far as possible only complete reports. Thus preliminary reports will usually not be published but will be held back until the complete report has been made. To cut down expenditure in reproduction, plans and diagrams and photographs included in the original reports will not be included except when essential. Malaria surveys of the Mopad area are published as a typical example of the harm done by excessive irrigation in the absence of proper drainage. It is useless to enrich the ryots by helping them to grow more rice and at the same time to poison them with malaria. Malaria survey of Udayagiri and Duttalur affords an interesting contrast with Mopad and show the relation of malaria to rainfall and how an epidemic can become severe enough to cause the infection of nearly 100 per cent of the children present. Malaria surveys of Vizagapatam harbour and town are included because of the present and future importance of that area. The opportunity is taken to publish a full report by the Sewage Analyst working under the Water and Sewage Purification Committee.
2 SUPPLEMENT TO THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FIRST REPORT ON MALARIA IN MOPAD (MARCH 1926) BY LIEUT.-COL. H. H. KING, I.M.S. AND CIVIL ASSISTANT SURGEON K. V. KRISHNAN. Institution of survey.3 KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY, FOR 1927-28 transition from extreme heat to cold. From the middle of March to September it is exceedingly hot reaching temperatures of 112° F. Chart I (not reproduced) gives the average rainfall per month from records taken at the reservoir for the last ten years and shows that the comparatively dry season is from December to July and that the rainy season is from September to end of November, i.e., during the latter half of the south-west monsoon and the whole of the north-east monsoon. As seen from the chart (not reproduced) the total rainfall is small being on the average 32" a year. Cultivation.4 SUPPLEMENT TO THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE water. They are also aware that mosquitoes (in the vernacular dhomalu) have enormously increased. They say that mosquitoes are present throughout the year, but that they are most numerous after a few showers of rain in October and November when malaria is also at its highest. Despite this, they will not believe " dhomalu " are responsible for the malaria. Since there are no hospitals in the area, no direct malaria statistics are available. But there is a dispensary at Pamur which is 6 miles west of Mopad and outside the irrigated area. This dispensary, being the only one within a radius of 20 miles from Pamur, is attended not only by the people immediately around it, but also by those from the Mopad area, and so we may take the records as furnishing evidence of malaria both in Mopad and in the other areas surrounding Pamur. Dispensary attend- ances do not refer solely to fresh cases. Old cases re-attending after a week or more are usually shown again as new attendances. So long as this practice does not vary much in extent (and there is no reason to think that it has done so) the records can serve as an index of the prevalence of a disease. The seasonal incidence shows a close correspondence of malaria with rainfall, malaria being at its worst from October to January. If this is correct, and it would seem to be so from facts mentioned later and from what we learn to be the malarial season in similar regions all along the north-east coast of the Madras Presidency, then it is clear that a survey to be full of value should include an inspection during September and October, for it would be at this time before and during the early malarial rise that a multiplication in the true anopheles carrier or carriers would be observed. While chart I (not reproduced) shows the close seasonal corre- spondence between malaria and rainfall, chart II (not reproduced) distinctly shows that the severity of malaria has not been dependant on the extent of rainfall which is an important point. Chart II (not reproduced) also shows a striking direct correspondence between malaria and the annual death-rate, rather proving that local opinion is correct in attributing many deaths directly or indirectly to malaria. The inverse relationship of the low birth-rate is important as contribu- tory proof because as is well known not only does malaria increase the death-rate by causing death or illness in adults but it directly lowers the birth-rate by producing abortion. Evidence of extent of malaria.KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY, FOR 1927-28 5 The first group of villages are those strictly within the Mopad area pre- viously described. They lie between the main irrigation canal and the river Maneru and further they are surrounded by irrigated fields. It will be noticed that both the spleen rate and the parasite rate in this group are very high6 SUPPLEMENT TO THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE TABLE V.KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY, FOR 19278 SUPPLEMENT TO THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE 3.

Then it probably ceases to breed mosquitoes to any important extent until the water again drops in. January. From this argument we conclude that pending the result of an inspection in September, the important breeding places are the Maneru river bed, and the drainage streams and the pit pools all partially dependant on the level of the sub-soil water whose general height seems to be the one factor most responsible for malaria. The importance of the Maneru bed in producing malaria is indicated by the fact that the unirrigated villages on higher ground north of the river showed as heavy an infection with malaria as villages in the irrigated Mopad area. The importance of drainage streams and other similar sources is shown by the severity of malaria at Kattakindipalle in the irrigated area well away from the Maneru10 SUPPLEMENT TO THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE 2. Well irrigation which lowers the sub-soil water level should be encourag- ed. We suggest that it is a measure generally applicable that when canal irrigation raises sub-soil water level, well irrigation which then is easier should be insisted on and thus canal water would be saved for use elsewhere. 3. In the new situation caused by the proposed change to dry crop irrigation such obvious minor anti-malarial measures as remain should be carried out, e.g., the draining or filling up of any breeding places near villages and the clearing away of jambo grass from canals. 4. A temporary dispensary should be established in the area and that before September. The most suitable village seems to be Botlagudur which is fairly central. Perhaps a travelling dispensary would serve. Conclusion.KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY, FOR 1927-28 11 to be a great assistance in investigation to enlist the aid of the people by treating them. Table X which follows gives the spleen and parasite rates of several villages. Since the Mopad area was well examined at the last visit, more attention was paid this time to villages in the area around, in order to give an idea of the prevalence of malaria in these parts where the conditions varied from those of Mopad as regards some important details.

This confirms the conjecture of the last report that most probably culicifacies was the chief carrier. This is more clearly shown by taking the totals of the infected females. Thus 23 infected culicifacies were found as against nine stephensi and three listoni. The mosquito infections were as follows:14 SUPPLEMENT TO THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE The other rivers with more flowing water in them such as the Vuppuvagu, the Pillaperu and the second part of the Maneru after it receives the Pillaperu, also have breeding places along the banks in isolated pools or pools behind rocks but to nothing like the extent of the first portion of the Maneru. The Vuppu- vagu is much further from the villages of the Mopad irrigated area than is the Maneru and so probably plays little or no part in producing malaria in that tract, but it is probably partly responsible for malaria in Dukkanur which is on its bank. The other breeding places here are several pools in apparently natural streams. Irrigation of a few fields of this village has been. begun but at present seems to be to so small an extent as to be of no importance in producing breeding places, hence the grouping of this village along with those of the Maneru River group but possibly the presence of the canal on the higher land to the north is responsible for some of the water in the streams east of Dukkanur.

15 KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY, FOR 1927-28 subsoil water-level will fall and water will not stay long in the beds of streams and drains. But even in this case it would be an improvement if some attention were paid to avoiding collections of water in drains and natural stream beds. Whatever is done to the Mopad area itself the adjacent part of the Maneru in its present condition will always remain a serious menace to the health not only of the Mopad tract but also of the villages on the other bank. It is doubtful whether either of the alternatives mentioned for improving the Mopad tract will affect the Maneru river to any serious extent, for the Manneru is the natural drain for this part of the country, and after the onset of the south-west monsoon will always tend to have water in it, and so will breed anophelines at the most dangerous time of the year from July to January. The only remedy seems to be to canalize it, but this may be not only expensive initially, but may have to be done after every heavy monsoon, because the Maneru receives the spill water of the reservoir. Perhaps it would be possible to arrange that the overflow of the Maneru at this time is regulated in such a way as to prevent damage to the drainage canal. 7.

From the extent of surface involved they too are probably very important. The irrigation channels were katcha without any atten- tion paid to their banks so that here and there they spread into pools that were ideal breeding places for culicifacies. It is unfortunate that the mountain streams could not be investigated on the western and southern sides of the main village that were covered with jungle continuous with that on the hill. This was because of the presence here of a man-eating tiger that had recently killed several people even taking one away from the village itself. Dr. Krishnan says that both in Mopad and near Udayagiri dacoits had sometimes to be guarded against by getting police escorts. So these furnish illustrations of some of the difficulties of a malarial survey. To return to breeding places, it must be remembered that they were inspected at the height of an epidemic when all sources were doing their best to provide mosquitoes. What is wanted is the knowledge of what are the sources mainly responsible for the regular rise in malaria in October, for before legislating for unusual conditions it is wiser to first face the usual ones. If possible, Udayagiri will be visited again at that time of the year and the conditions ascertained, meanwhile we can say that wells, tanks and streams appear to he the chief offenders.

Adult mosquitoes.KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY, FOR 1927-28 21 consists of one main and 3 subsidiary hamlets22 SUPPLEMENT TO THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Both spleen and parasite rates particularly the latter are rather high than one would expect. The explanation is that many of the Duttalur adults have been to Udayagiri for several days at a time, e.g., for the revenue jamabandi which was on at the time of the survey. Thus some of the adults probably got infected in Udayagiri. This is an illustration of the necessity for choosing as healthy as possible a town for administrative headquarters for the sake not only of local inhabitants but also of villagers in the district. Adult mosquitoes.KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY, FOR 1927-28 23 A NOTE ON CONDITIONS IN DUTTALUR IN DECEMBER 1926 BY CIVIL ASSISTANT SURGEON M. K. RAMASWAMI AYYAR. Duttalur was visited in 1926 with a view to note any changes in the mosquitoes and their breeding places at this season of the year as already suggested in the previous report. Here also, as in Mopad and Udayagiri, the north-east monsoon, the chief monsoon that brings rain to these parts, failed with the result that all the tanks were dried up except for small collections of water in pits. Similarly the streams and irrigation channels were dried up. When adult mosquitoes were caught from houses, etc., they were found to be mostly culicines with a few anophelines belonging to the non-carrier species rossi. Pools in the beds of the tanks contained larvæ of A.rossi. The well at Kammavaripallem which contained larvæ of A. jamesi in plenty during April was completely free from larvæ at this time. COMMENTS ON THE FIRST AND SECOND MOPAD, UDAYAGIRI AND DUTTALUR MALARIA REPORTS BY LIEUT.-COL. H. H. KING, I.M.S. These reports very well illustrate the great importance of two factors in the causation of malaria: (a) the provision of breeding places for mosquito larvæ by water from rainfall or from local sources, (b) the provision of climatic conditions suitable for the life of adult anophelines24 SUPPLEMENT TO THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE reached the place on the evening of the 27th, and as per the previous arrangement of the District Medical Officer a camp laboratory was fixed up at the Medical School. The following morning I interviewed the District Medical Officer in order to find out from him the exact nature of the proposed enquiry. He directed me to see the Engineer-in-Chief of the harbour works; I saw the latter officer the same day and discussed matters with him. I understood that the object of the survey was shortly this:KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY, FOR 1927-28 25 Rainfall.26 SUPPLEMENT TO THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE No reliable statistics regarding the chief cause of mortality and sickness in this locality are available. The village returns show that over 60 per cent of deaths are due to " fevers." From enquiries made in the villages it is clear that malaria is by far the most prevalent and serious disease. Hence it is highly probable that a large proportion of deaths from " fevers " is due to malaria. Also the great rise in the mortality during the period July to January may in this instance be partly due to malaria, as the months of May and October are the months when malaria is most prevalent. Spleen rate.KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY, FOR 1927-28 27 It is worthy of note that the largest and the most representative collections of larvæ of the dangerous varieties of anophelines prevalent in the locality, were obtained from the two proposed sites. It will also be noted that the chief breeding places of the malaria carrying species, were the geddas which have their origin from the Dolphin hills. In all probability the Dolphin range itself provides the most extensive and dangerous breeding places, for, it was observed that collections of larvæ from the geddas near the foot of the hill were more numerous than collections farther away from the hill. Several collections of larvæ were made from the extensive swamp though at different places but the majority proved to be A. rossi. However, from the swamp near Tepparevu and Tikkodipalem, a few larvæ of A. fuliginosus were obtained. Other than these no dangerous variety of anopheles larvæ was caught from the swamp. A few wells in Valakampet and Dibbamidipalem, yielded anopheles stephensi. But in no other village were the wells found to be harbouring dangerous larvæ. The majority of larvæ collected from pools, ditches, and burrow pits, proved to be A. rossi though a few were A. culicifacies. From Dibbamidi- palem where rice and ragi cultivation is carried on, culicifacies and fuliginosus larvæ were caught in fair numbers from the irrigation channels adjoining the fields. In the huts of the villagers in the Malakapuram area adult anopheles could easily be secured in large numbers. Out of this, the majority proved to be A. rossi. A few A. culicifacies were also caught from the huts but with great difficulty. The huts had such dark and dingy walls that it was found very difficult to spot mosquitoes of the type of A. culicifacies even with the aid of a lamp. Thirty- one adult A. culicifacies caught in two batches of 17 and 14 from infected houses, were dissected for sporozoites and zygotes and only one showed the presence of zygotes. A. culicifacies was the only species living in close association with human beings and as such there is no doubt that this species is the chief malaria carrier in these parts. Summary.28 SUPPLEMENT TO THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE (6) Filling up of the few small geddas that are the result of the overflow of water from the larger geddas, and do not directly originate from the hill. (7) Construction of small canals along the hill slope with a view to collect- ing all the rain water coming down from the hill. The direction of all these canals should slope towards the particular gedda into which it is proposed to drain them. (8) Provision of a good and protected water-supply. To start with wells should form the chief source for drinking and culinary purposes. As certain species of anopheles in the locality are well breeders, the wells constructed should be mosquito proof. This object may be gained by attaching pumps to the wells and having a concrete coverings for their mouths, with trap doors. These doors should always be secured with padlocks. All spill water should be suitably drained. (9) All old wells and tanks in the locality should be filled up. (10) Mosquito proof houses for the labourers will be essential. Only then the best labour output can be extracted. Also in the labour corps to be formed there is sure to be a good number of malaria carriers having gametocytes in their bloods. These will be a positive source of danger to the others unless mosquito proof houses are provided. (11) All old huts which are great harbouring places for infected mosquitoes, should be destroyed. (12) No cultivation of rice and ragi should be allowed near Dibbamidi- palem as this favours the breeding of dangerous mosquitoes. The irrigation canals should be filled up and the fields levelled and properly drained. The human factor should be tackled in two places; (i) the labour camp, and (ii) the adjoining villages.

There are many more private ones, and some are now only very sparingly used because of the introduction of a piped water public supply. Only a few of the wells in private houses could be examined because entry to many houses was not allowed. Larvæ of A. stephensi were found not only in the large disused wells but also in some of the smaller ones in use. Table II shows the result of examination of the wells in the different areas together with the observations on the p.H. of the water, and of its electrical conductivity, in order to give information on its salinity. It will be seen that out of the 40 wells examined in the fort, Temple and Chengalraopeta wards, A. stephensi has been found in 20, giving a larval index of 50 per cent. Conditions are different in the other wards where, with the exception of Chakkalipeta, wells are rare. Careful search failed to discover A. stephensi larvæ in these. .

From larvæ obtained were bred out A. subpictus, culicifacies, A. stephensi and A. karwari. This last is an addition to our April list of the Anopheline fauna of this place. It was noted in our first report that the presence of A. stepheisi was an uncommon feature for a seepage stream like this, but even more remarkable is its continued presence at this time when A. culicifacies has displaced it even from the wells which are the natural habitants of A. stephensi. (c) The Yarri gedda.40 SUPPLEMENT TO THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE In Kotha Salepeta, Chakkalipeta and Dibbalapalem which follow next the people live in crowded insanitary huts; the comparatively high spleen rate here for which no reason was apparent during the April survey is doubtless due to the A. culicifacies breeding in the Gangala Gedda. The endemicity in the town areas, where the economic conditions are better and the houses are mostly pucca is mainly due to the wells breeding A. stephensi and A. culicifacies, both bad carriers of malaria. But even here relatively higher figures are found for the poorer people crowded in the Ambusarang quarters and the Kadirvari lanes of the Fort ward. The other crowded areas of Jalaripeta, Reliveedi, etc., are relatively farther from the principal breeding areas and their low spleen rate is doubtless attributable to this. 8. In the light of the above findings, I consider that malaria propagation in Vizagapatam will be greatly reduced and the mosquito nuisance considerably abated, if the following recommendations are carried out:VIZAGAPATAM, AUGUST 1927.

A sufficient number of cross drains leading into this main drain will keep the marshy land dry and these can be kept safe by weekly oil treatment. (g) While these measures are being undertaken, systematic oiling of all the breeding places must be commenced at once to keep down the mosquito production. Provision must be made for an adequate staff for periodically examining and regularly oiling all the areas. To leave them to the existing staff of Sanitary Inspectors will not do. A separate anti-malarial staff of at least one Sanitary Inspector and four coolies will be necessary, and during the rainy months an additional temporary staff will be required to fill up a number of small puddles and conserve the edges of drains, the sides of the tanks, etc., to remove algae, and to prepare the places for oiling generally. A mixture of crude oil and castor oil (in the proportion of one ounce of the latter to a gallon) sprayed from a hand spraying machine has been found to be satisfactory. (h) Three authorities are now interested in the anti-malarial operation in Vizagapatam, viz., the municipality, the harbour and the railway authorities. It is greatly desirable, they should co-operate and their efforts be co-ordinated by a single board whereon all the three can be represented. 9. I am greatly indebted to Dr. C. Balakrishna Chetti, M.B., B.S., D.P.H., Health Officer, Vizagapatam Municipality who detailed one of his Sanitary Inspectors to assist me in the investigation and himself accompanied me on several occasions when collecting adult mosquitoes from the houses; and to Dr. C. Ramamurti, M.B., B.S., B.S.SC., Professor of Hygiene, Vizagapatam Medical College, who estimated the salt contents of some of the specimens of water for me. APPENDIX. Well num- ber. p. H.

NOTE.42 SUPPLEMENT TO THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE The sewage dealt with is mainly domestic and varies in quantity as well as in character day by day. The capacity of each of the open and closed septic tanks is 12,000 gallons. The tanks are built above ground level and sewage is pumped up into the tanks. Experiments were confined to the open and closed septic tanks effluents because there was not enough sewage to work the Imhoff tank regularly, so although a few analyses of its effluent were made, no conclusions can be drawn as to its functioning. The mixed effluent from these tanks is led on to a raised rough stone bacterial filter on which it drips through a Stoddart dripper. The average time of passage through the filter is 10 minutes. The results of analyses of the sewage, open and closed septic tank effluents are given in Tables I and II. samples were taken from these sources at the same time. There were three periods of working of the tanks. During the first period (July to October 1926) the volume of sewage treated was 6,000 gallons per day and this gave a detention period of 24 hours in the tanks. During the second period (October to December 1926) the flow was increased, consequently the period of detention was reduced to 18 hours. Finally from December 1926 to March 1927, the tanks were treating the full flow namely 24,000 gallons per day so that the period of stay of sewage in the tanks was only 12 hours. Period IKING INSTITUTE, GUINDY, FOR 1927-28 43 difference between the effluents from the open and closed septic tanks. The closed septic tank effluent was definitely the better as regards the albuminoid nitrogen present, but was a little the worse as regards the oxygen absorbed which is what one would expect. Since the result for albuminoid nitrogen is more important we may conclude that on the whole the closed septic tank gave slightly better results than did the open tank. The bacterial filter worked well judging from the results (compare Tables II and III) which are well above the standards laid down by the Royal Commission on Sewage, viz., 0.2 per 100,000 for albu- minoid nitrogen, 2.0 parts per 100,000 for oxygen absorbed. Further there were always plenty of nitrites and nitrates in the final effluent.

Also most of the deaths in the inoculated are found to occur before the fifth day after inoculation, i.e., before the maximum protection had had time to develop. Had the third column in the above table been described as attacks among the 8 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 4. Wassermann tests.REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 9 (D) WATER. The periodical examination of samples from all protected water supplies in the Presidency constituted the bulk of the routine work of the section. Occa- sional samples of water were examined for their suitability for industrial and boiler purposes. There was no increase in the total number of protected water- supplies during the year under report. Table XIV gives the total number of examinations carried out and it will be seen that there has been an enormous- increase in the volume of work turned out. This was mainly due to the very large number of samples that bad to be examined daily at the Kilpauk Experi- mental Filter Station. Details of these will be found under (F) "Work for the Committee on Water and Sewage Purification." As was done in previous years, a synopsis of the results of the periodical examination of water-supplies is given in Table XV. The following call for comment:10 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY draw water using their own ropes and buckets. Unless these cisterns are covered in and provided with pumps, the process of chlorination will remain an expensive and wasteful procedure. The provision of municipal ropes and buckets with strict injunctions to use those alone, would minimize the risks to some extent, if the provision of pumps would be too expensive. Jail supplies.REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 11 It was not possible to complete the water survey tour undertaken in 1927, as Mr. Raghavachari was fully occupied with the work for the Committee on Water and Sewage Purification at Kilpauk and could not consequently be detailed for this work. When the work at Kilpauk permits of some respite this work will be resumed. The experience gained during the survey in the previous years has been of very great help in assessing the sanitary quality of individual supplies with reference to local conditions and in suggesting suitable improve- ments where needed. (E) CHEMICAL SECTION. The work of the section has been, as usual, mainly (1) the routine chemical analysis of protected water supplies in the Presidency. In addition to this a fairly large number of analyses (see Table XIV) were carried out for the Govern- ment Water Filtration Committee from the Kilpauk Experimental Station and various other small investigation schemes in this Presidency. (2) Foodstuffs for analysis have again consisted mainly of tenderer's samples from hospitals in the City and the Presidency, though a few were from private individuals (for list of samples see Table XVII). Of 57 samples of bread analysed, only four did not come up to the standard laid down in the Surgeon- General's circular.

Statistical research.16 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY The Water Analysis Section has expanded considerably during recent years. Not only has the routine work expanded a great deal owing to an increase in the number of protected and. railway water supplies in the Presidency, but the work involved in the analyses of water samples both at Guindy and Kilpauk for the Water Purification Committee has also been enormous. This has, however, enabled the Committee to make certain specific recommendations for improving the City water-supply. In this connection I should like to mention particularly the good work done by M.R.Ry. T. N. S. Raghavachari Avargal, the Senior Bacterio- logical Assistant, who is in sub-charge of the section, which is under the control of the Public Analyst. To his zeal and ability are due a great measure of our success in establishing the relative value of different types of filters first at Guindy and later at Kilpauk. While the routine work has increased, the field of scientific research has not been neglected. New technical methods described from time to time are being investigated and adopted when found satisfactory and very interesting and important results have been obtained by research in elephantiasis and filariasis in all its aspects.

No. 2393, 3rd October 1929 Administration Report2 No. 2393, P.H., 3RD OCTOBER 1929 number of vaccine doses issued was 1,064,490 against 727,000 in 1927-28. The Government observe that the value of cholera inoculation is being realized by the general public increasingly. There was a definite increase in the supply of autogenous vaccine in spite of the fact that the General Hospital makes its own autovaccines. The number of Wassermann tests done during the year was 16,081 against 16,071 in 1927-23 and over 2,000 kahn tests were also done. The rate of fee for Wassermann test in respect of the cases sent by the medical practitioners in the Madras City has, as an experimental measure, been reduced from Rs. 32 to Rs. 5. The Government trust that this reduction will tend to increase the number of tests. 6. The samples of foodstuff analysed were, as in the previous year, mostly hospitals tenders in the City and the Presidency and only a few were from private individuals. The Madras Prevention of Adulteration Act, 1918, having been extended to the City of Madras and ten other mufassal municipal towns from 1st July 1929 the Government hope that there will be an increase in the number of samples of foodstuff for analysis. A small number of samples of drugs examined during the year with reference to a circular issued by the Surgeon- General showed the very serious need for analytical control of dispensed prescrip- tions. The result of further investigations and the steps that will have to be taken to bring about improvement in the matter will be watched with interest. 7. The investigation units attached to the Institute continued to do valuable work in the surveys of (1) rat flea, (2) filariasis, and (3) other special investigations. 8. The third report on the experiments conducted at the Experimental Filter Station at Kilpauk was communicated to the President, Corporation of Madras, in G.O. No. 709, P.H., dated 15th March 1929, and he was requested to report the views of the Madras Corporation on the recommendations made in the report. The President is requested to expedite the views of the Corporation in the matter. Owing to the experiments carried out at this Filter Station, the Institute had to examine a far larger number of samples of water than in the previous years. The Institute also carried out as usual the periodical examina- tion of samples from all protected water-supplies in the Presidency. The attention of the Municipal Councils concerned is invited to the observations made in the report on the condition of water-supply in certain municipalities and they are requested to take necessary steps to remedy the defects pointed out therein. 9. The Director reports that the untreated well water in many of the jails was grossly polluted and he urges that the local investigations recommended by him in his last two reports should be carried out. The Government have received a special report from the Inspector-General of Prisons on the question and have come to the conclusion that no special investigation of the water-supply in the wells of jails is necessary. The existing precautionary measures of chlorination of water and periodical inspection of the supply should be continued. 10. The water supplied at some of the railway stations is reported to be either definitely bad or unsatisfactory and systematic chlorination has been recommended in many cases. The Government trust that this recommendation will be carried out by the Railway authorities concerned. As regards the water supplied to the Hospet Railway Station the Director reports that it is still derived from the drainage water of a neighbouring plantation. It is also reported that the practice of supplying water by tin cans from open buckets instead of through closed cans with spouts continues to prevail at some of the stations. The Agents of the M. & S.M. and the S.I. Railway Cos. are requested to see that the practice is discontinued. 11. In order to obtain a first-hand knowledge of the local conditions, a survey of the water-supplies of the Presidency was undertaken during the year 1927. No progress is reported to have been made in the matter on account of
No. 2393, P.H., 3RD OCTOBER 1929 3 the work entailed by the experiments conducted at Kilpauk. The Government trust that definite progress will be made in this survey at least by the time the Director submits his next report. 12. The Government are glad to record their appreciation of the efficient manner in which the Director, the Officiating Director and his staff have carried on the work of the Institute especially that relating to research in elephantiasis and filariasis in all its aspects and of the very valuable assistance rendered to other departments and to public at large particularly when cholera epidemic was prevalent in a severe form in some parts of the Presidency.

The usual first-class vaccinators' class was held in the Institute for a fort- night in March 1930 and 86 students attended. The students of the B.S.SC., and Health Officers' class also attended the Institute in October 1929 for a week for training in the manufacture and use of vaccine lymph. Nine visits were made by batches of students from colleges and schools during the year. The Institute was specially on exhibit for a total of five days during "Health Week" in February 1930. Admission was restricted to students and to the educated publicREPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 3 test, and secondly to a further increase in the number of water samples examined. The work of the Investigation Units and of other researches carried out are, as usual, left out of account in arriving at a financial estimate of the value of the work done. The net profit therefore serves as an index of the very large increase in the routine work of the Institute. DISTINGUISHED VISITORS. Her Excellency Lady Beatrix Stanley. Dr. Y. G.

The following case is of inter- est in the success achieved. The patient aged 45 had suffered for about 10 years from chronic inflammation of a maxillary antrum which was being treated surgically off and on with temporary relief. One year ago he developed acute pains in the joints chiefly in the hip. In October 1929 his condition became much worse and he sought the help of a vaccine. M. deformans was isolated from the purulent discharge from his antrum and made into a vaccine, which was given first in small doses of 5,000 organisms, and which was then worked up slowly in 6 months to doses of a million at a time. As a result of the treatment he improved considerably and has since left for Europe. Whereas he used to arrive at the Institute bent double and walking with difficulty he finally went away riding a motor bicycle.

Villupuram on the South Indian Railway and at Naupada and Vizianagram on the B.N. Railway, were found to be of either fair or good quality during the year under report. At other stations not specifically mentioned in the two lists given above, the water-supply was either indifferent or poor in quality needing remedial measures. At Mangalagiri, Ongole and Nanclyal water was brought from other stations in wagons and supplied to the passengers because the wells in those stations had either dried up, or yielded very polluted and chemically impure water.

In one of the eighteen blood slides sent organisms were seen free in the blood which resembled B. pestis in appearance and staining. It is impossible to know the significance of this finding in the absence of cultures. The particular case concerned had the usual history of short fever plus enlargement of a groin gland followed by recovery in a few days. The Unit arrived in Kara on the 7th August too late to see any cases in the acute stage. Blood and gland smears and blood for agglutination tests and for cultures were taken from as many convalescents as possible15 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY by sera from human cases of elephantiasis against Microfilaria bancrofti. The sera used in the experiments here had been obtained. from local cases. Dr. Menon visited Negapatarn and Vizagapatam and compared the reactions against Micro- filariae from infected people in those localities that were obtained using the same sera as used in the work at Guindy. The opposite change was also made. Sera from elephantiasis cases in Negapatam and Vizagapatam were tested against Guindy strains of Micro-filariae. All the reactions were positive, so evidence was obtained that there is no species difference in strains of Micro-filariae Bancrofti from people in Guindy, Negapatam and Vizagapatam.

The results of these investigations will be available when percolators on a large scale are con- structed. (d) As a result of their various experiments, the Committee thinks that with regard to both economy and the obtaining of a good effluent, percolation followed by semi-rapid sand filtration is the method best adapted to purify water at Kilpauk. The fact that the organic content of the raw water has increased in the last two years, renders the adoption of some method such as this, aiming at the preliminary removal of some of the organic impurity, still more necessary if the present sand filters are to be used at all. Some other experiments for the Water and Sewage Purification Committee were also done at Guindy on the effect of chlorination of raw water on the filter- ing skin in slow sand filtration. No deleterious effect was observed. (6) Atypical water vibrios.17 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY investigated. These rabbits had been vaccinated at least two months before the onset of symptoms, so in these three cases the vaccinia virus was found in the tissues sixty days after the primary vaccination which is worth recording. The cause of death was not the vaccinia virus, but probably an infection with B. mucosus capsulatus which was isolated from the lungs from all cases, and from the heart blood and other organs in some of the cases. This organism produced similar lesions and death in other animals after their experimental infection.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST TO THE GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31ST MARCH 1930 (Issued as a Supplement to the Report of the King Institute, Guindy) BY HERBERT HAWLEY, M.Sc., F.I.C. Public Analyst to Government [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of 74938996.tif] MADRAS PRINTED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT, GOVERNMENT PRESS 1931
REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST TO GOVERNMENT. (Report called for by G.O. No. 142 P.H., dated 22nd January 1930.) BY HERBERT HAWLEY, M.SC., F.I.C., Public Analyst to Government. I have the honour to submit my report for the year ending March 31st, 1930. As the Prevention of Adulteration Act, 1918, only came into active operation during this year, I am taking the opportunity provided by the issue of the first report on its working to review the work carried out in connexion with it since my appointment as Public Analyst to Government in January 1924. Before the Act could be brought into use it was necessary that certain stan- dards provided for by section 20 should be prescribed. Samples of milk, butter and ghee were analysed and my results were summarized in a report on Food Standards in which I drafted a number of regulations for adoption under the Act, including standards for milk and butter. Government Orders embodying these standards have now been passed and are reprinted in the appendices to this report. Draft regulations under section 20 (c) (care of utensils, etc.) were also prepared in consultation with the Director of Public Health and were made official in G.O. No. 2098 P.H., dated 24th November 1926. In my report I commented on the fact that the Madras Act was based on the obsolete English Act of 1875 and that to bring it up to date an amending Act was necessary. I prepared a draft of the new Act and this was given as an ap- pendix to my report. For the purpose of considering the new Act, Lt.-Col. A. J. H. Russell, I.M.S., Director of Public Health and myself were appointed temporary members of the Legislative Council. The Bill was referred to a Committee of which we were members and was passed by the Legislative Council with a few amendments (Act 3 of 1927). The new Act extended the power of Government to prescribe standards to all foods. Government have now utilized these powers to prescribe standards for tea (G.O. No. 2097 P.H., dated 26th August 1929). The new Act also allowed of regulations being made for the preservation of samples of milk, which is very necessary to maintain them in a condition suitable for analysis. These regulations were included in G.O. No. 1804 P.H., dated 4th September 1928. It will be seen by reference to the appendix that the main Act is not appli- cable to the Presidency generally but only to the areas under the control of such local bodies as are gazetted by Government for the purpose and for such foods as may be specified. After a rather lengthy correspondence between Government and the local bodies concerned the Act was brought into force in G.O. Press No. 1410 P.H., dated 5th June 1929, for the Corporation of Madras, Ootacamund, Calicut, Coimbatore, Gunt2 REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST TO GOVERNMENT In the case of Madras City, my appointment is definitely temporary and for a period of two years, during which period I am to train a suitably qualified chemist (appointed by the Corporation) to act as their Public Analyst. While under training he will assist with the analysis of samples and at the end of his time, if he Shows sufficient competency, he will assume independent responsibility as Public Analyst for the City. During this period the Corporation of Madras are to pay Rs. 5,000 annually to Government. In the case of the other local bodies no time limit has been fixed. The agreement in each case is that each of the areas to which the Act has been extended shall pay Rs. 720 per annum and shall be allowed to submit a maximum of 15 samples monthly. Samples in excess of this number are to be paid for at the rate of Rs. 7 per sample. My duties (G.O. No. 645 P.H., dated 19th March 1930) also include3 REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST TO GOVERNMENT Below are given particulars of the adulterated samples with the action taken by the municipality in each case:4 REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST TO GOVERNMENT In the case of drugs I allow a tolerance of 10 per cent error in dispensing. Mixtures in which the error in dispensing an essential ingredient exceeds this amount are classed as adulterated. Breads are sent to me for examination by hospitals, etc., in accordance with the instructions laid down in the Surgeon-General's circular No. 19-Bud.-26,- dated 1st February 1926. This circular was issued following the very unsatisfac- tory results which I obtained on the analysis (on the instruction of Major-General Symons) of a series of samples of bread supplied by contractors. I found that a large proportion of the samples contained alum, which is added to enable a bread of good colour to be obtained from inferior flour. Other samples gave very high figures for acidity pointing to sour flour having been used. The Surgeon- General's circular prescribes that the bread supplied to hospitals shall be (i) free from alum, (ii) that the acidity (in terms of Normal acid per 100 grammes of dry bread) shall not exceed three units and (iii) that the ash insoluble in acid shall not exceed 0.1 per cent (this is a limit for sand and grit). Since the issue of this circular there has been a great improvement in the quality of bread supplied by contractors. During the year under report alum has not been detected in any of the samples. The 29 samples classed as adulterated gave an acidity in excess of the prescribed limit, but the excess was in the great majority of cases quite small and there is further evidence of a progressive improvement which is brought out by the following figures:5 REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST TO GOVERNMENT APPENDIX A. MADRAS ACT No. III OF 1918. The Madras Prevention of Adulteration Act, 1918. Preamble. WHEREAS it is expedient, in the interests of the public health, to prevent the adulteration of food; It is hereby enacted as follows:6 REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST TO GOVERNMENT (b) manufactures for sale, or offers for sale or hawks about or sells any food which is not of the nature, substance or quality which it purports, or is represented to be; or (c) abstracts from any food any part of it so as to affect injuriously the nature, substance or quality thereof with intent that it should be sold in its altered state without notice of the alteration, or sells any article so altered without making disclosure of the alteration; or (d) sells milk, cream, butter, ghee or cheese which is not up to the standard of purity prescribed by the Governor in Council; shall be punished for the first offence with fine which may extend to one hundred rupees and for every subsequent offence with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees: Provided that in the following cases no offence under this section shall be deemed to have been committed:7 REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST TO GOVERNMENT Power of local executive officer to seize adulterated food, etc. 9.

Production of articles, etc., seized before magis- trate and powers of magis- trate to deal with them. 12 (1) Articles of food or samples thereof, utensils, or vessels seized under section 9, shall, as soon as possible, be produced before a magistrate; Provided, that where a sample of an article has been sent to the public analyst the article or sample thereof may be produced before the magistrate after receipt of the public analyst's certificate. (2) Whether or not complaint is laid before the magistrate of any offence under the Indian Penal Code or under this Act, if it appears to the magistrate on taking such evidence as he thinks necessary that any such article is adulterated or other than what it purports or is represented to be, or any such utensil or vessel is of such kind or in such state as is described in section 9 he may order the same (a) to be forfeited to the local authority, or (b) to be destroyed at the charge of the owner or person in whose possession it was at the time of seizure in such manner as to prevent the same being again exposed or hawked about for sale or used for human food or for the manufacture or preparation of or for con- taining any such article as aforesaid. Purchaser may have food analysed. 13. (1) Any purchaser of any article of food shall be entitled, if a public analyst has been appointed for the area within which such article is purchased, on payment of such fees as may be prescribed by the authority appointing the analyst, to have such article analysed by such public analyst and to receive from him a certificate of the result of his analysis. (2) Before submitting such article to be analysed as aforesaid the purchaser shall notify to the seller his intention to have it so analysed; and the public analyst on receiving such article for analysis shall divide it into three parts, of which one is to be analysed, another to be retained by him in order to be returned with his certificate and the third to be delivered on demand to the seller: provided that each part, other than the part analysed, shall be marked and sealed or fastened up in such manner as its nature permits. Power of local executive officer to purchase samples for analysis. 14.

(2) Every such person who refuses to sell such sample to the local executive officer or any person duly authorized by him at the price at which he usually sells the article shall be punished with fine which may extend to Rs. 100.

CONTENTS. PART I.REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY, FOR THE HALF-YEAR 1ST APRIL TO 30TH SEPTEMBER 1930. Hitherto annual reports have covered the period April to March but under G.O. No. 2516, P.H., dated 8th October 1930, permission has been received to alter the period of the annual report to the period October to September. So this report made during the transition period covers only the half-year April to September 1930. Accordingly comparisons with other reports will be difficult because the period covered is rather a special one, over the hot weather months only, and for this reason and because of the short period the report will not go into as much detail as usual.

All the six non-Christians are from Gunt28 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY have suffered from the disease during the height of its prevalence, but had made a complete recovery. These were generally unwilling to submit themselves for examination. An account of their illness was obtained from 20 of these and studied; as also the history of the disease, with such particulars as could be obtained from their relatives, of 17 persons known to have died from it. The observations made on the cases more thoroughly investigated, included, besides a careful physical examination, the estimation of the percentage of Hæmoglobin, examination of stained blood films and a differential leucocyte count in a certain number, and micros- copical and cultural examinations of the stool. Arrangements were made to inspect the whole stool from a number of them, who were given fresh earthenware pans to deposit their stool in and instructed to send the same in as fresh a state as possible to the Labora- tory. 4. Summary of observations.REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 29 soreness of the mouth and especially the actual inflammation of the edges as I noticed in a few cases is unusual in that disease; and further the incidence of ankylostome infection. among the cases investigated, viz., 75 per cent is not so high for a rural community as to make this diagnosis alone tenable on epidemiological grounds in the absence of more definite evidence. Dietetic deficiency, especially general protein deficiency, and deficiency of vitamins in the normal diet of the people could explain, and doubtlessly contributed, to some of the features in the clinical picture of many of the cases. But, it does not cover all the points, as for instance, the epidemic onset of the disease which in a majority of the cases was limited to just those two months of last year. Unsuitable diet is still offered as a possible explanation of the condition especially in view or the fact that the people in the villages have not had sufficient time to adjust themselves to an altered diet of rice, which has only recently be- come the staple article among most of them; and the month of maximum prevalence coincid- ing with the period of harvesting of ground-nuts may have had something to do with the setting up of digestive disturbances in many of the cases. 6. Conclusions.30 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY obtained in only half the cases. Unlike the cases at Pennadam, ankylostome infestation was not observed to be prevalent. Not one case in this series could be presented as typical of Sprue; but the clinical condition of several of them resembled Sprue more closely than any other disease. There was a chronic diarrhREPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 31 Dr. Venkataraman has made a close study of the clinical aspects of the cases as well as a thorough bacteriological investigation into ætiological nature.

It is surprising to note that no legal proceedings were taken by the Coimbatore Municipal Council even though the food samples sent for examination from the municipality were in several cases grossly adulterated. The Chairman, Municipal Council, Ootacamund, is advised to see that samples are sent regularly and in small batches and that greater discrimination is used in the selec- tion of samples with a view to find out dishonest vendors.

This report covers the full year2 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY Rs. 4,50,912 which gives an estimated net profit of Rs. 4,27,681 despite the present low price of Wassermann and Kahn tests. As usual this statement does not include any estimate of the financial value of the research work done. The main increase in expenditure and receipts is due to the increased demand for sera by Government Hospitals and Institutions. At present sera are distri- buted to Government Hospitals free, the cost being borne by the Institute. Table II gives the cost of sera supplied to various hospitals, etc., by districts. BUILDINGS. A total grant of Rs. 1,15,400 was sanctioned in G.O. Mis. No. 278 W., dated 31st January 1928. The following works have been in progress during the year:REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 3 passage cycle, see Part II. This second factor has considerably increased the yield per calf. The average this year is 26.2 grammes instead of 23.8 grammes, the average for the last three years. The record yield has gone up from 56 to 75 grammes.

Sanjivi Rao investigated an outbreak of jaundice in Alipuram Jail. (7) In September 1931 Dr. K. V. Venkatraman investigated an outbreak of typhoid at Cocanada. (8) Mr. P. V. Sitarama Ayyar, the Institute Zoologist, visited Coimbatore in December, March and July, and Bellary in April to complete a seasonal rat flea survey.
8 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY PART II.REPORT OF THE RING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 9 To determine the source of such organisms in lymphs, the urine faeces and. saliva of calves were cultured in suitable media. Organisms identical with those described above were noted in all cases. It was, however, noted that their chief source was the skin of calves. Skin scrapings from calves taken at the time of vaccination showed the presence of these organisms in a majority of cases. They are to be considered. as saprophytes and it is contended that the issue of lymph containing them is therefore not contra-indicated. Experiments to devise methods to prevent these organisms gaining access to lymph are in progress and will be published in due course. (5) Protection against smallpox or vaccinia by anti-vaccinia serum.10 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY comparative doses of each are being studied. So far no difference has been noted with the two strains investigated.

SUPPLEMENT TO THE REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY. (Called for by G.O. No. 142, P.H., dated 22nd January 1930, and G.O. Mis. No. 2516, P.H., dated 8th October 1930.) I have the honour to report that during the period of 1st October 1930 to 30th September 1931, 2091 samples were submitted to me for analysis in my capacity as Public Analyst. Of these 1,777 were submitted under the Prevention of Adulteration Act by local bodies, four were submitted by local bodies not working the Act, and 310 consisted of miscellaneous foods and drugs submitted by various Government hospitals and institutions. Samples under the Prevention of Adulteration Act.33 REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST TO THE GOVT. OF MADRAS Of the local bodies submitting samples Madras City is not limited as to number. Normally 1 receive about 100 per month. The smaller number during the year under report is due to the fact that following an appeal case in the High Court which decided that some of the regulations made under the Act were ultra vires sampling ceased for over two months. With a modified procedure sampling recommenced. Other local bodies are entitled to submit 180 samples per year. It will be seen that in the case of Vizagapatam only has full advantage been taken of the introduction of the Act though in the case of Madura, Rajahmundry, and Trichinopoly a substantial number of samples has been taken. Generally where a small number of samples has been taken the majority have been received during the latter part of the year and under pressure from the Director of Public Health, who now receives a monthly report from me and calls for an explanation when the number of samples taken by any municipality is low. It is to be hoped, and there appears to be a reasonable expectation, that in many cases a number of samples more nearly approaching a full quota will be submitted during the year commencing October 1931. In the case of Gunt&#363;r where no samples were taken, the Chairman did not make the usual delegation of his powers to the Municipal Health Officer and his staff so that they had no authority to take samples. I have no information as to why no samples were sent from Karaikudi. The Act was introduced into Proddatur only late in the year under report and the commencement of sampling was delayed owing to dissatisfaction by the municipality with the terms on which they were permitted to submit samples. These difficulties have now been cleared up. Chart B shows the number of cases in which legal proceedings have been taken and the average fine inflicted, where convictions ensued, in each munici- pality and for each article of food. CHART B.

First the appalling extent to which dishonesty exists amongst food-vendors generally. Of the total number of samples taken it will be seen that more than 40 per cent were adulterated, whilst, in the case of essential articles of food such as ghee and milk more than 50 per cent of the samples had to be condemned. In considering these figures it should be borne in mind that a sample taker carrying out his duties labours under a number of special dis- advantages, more particularly the fact that he is known and that, when he decides to devote a day to taking samples information of his activities will spread rapidly 5
34 REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST TO THE GOVT. OF MADRAS amongst the food-vendors in his district, so that it may be taken as certain that the proportion of adulteration in food-stuffs bought casually by the general public is even higher than that revealed by my analyses. A. second point on which I wish to comment is the total inadequacy of the fines inflicted. The average fine is only Rs. 9 for all samples and in only one municipality does it exceed Rs. 20. I believe that in many cases hawkers or petty vendors have been prosecuted. Even in such cases it seems to me that the least fine that should be inflicted for a first conviction, with any probability of its causing a definite check to food adulteration is Rs. 20. Possibly an example will be of assistance in justifying this figure. Presumably the poorest milkman will be one owning a single cow. Normally he will get a yield of about two measures per day, the proper price for which is one rupee. Supposing he adds to this milk half its volume (one measure) of water per day35 REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST TO THE GOVT. OF MADRAS Number and name of place. Amount of fine recovered. RS. 6.

Vizagapatam 368 Total . . . 3,501 It will be seen that in Coimbatore where substantial, but in my opinion by no means excessive fines have been inflicted, almost all the municipal contribution has been recovered, this, in spite of the fact that the number of samples taken was less than what they are allowed to send. In the Vizagapatam where a full number of samples has been taken approximately half the municipal contribution has been recovered, although the average fine amounted to the petty sum of Rs. 5. Where the whole or nearly the whole of their contribution has had to be borne by a municipality they have no one to blame but themselves. It seems to me that when the further extension of the Act, which is now contemplated is made, the local bodies concerned should be told that their contribution should not be con- sidered an unavoidable expense but should rather be regarded as a penalty to which they will have to submit in the event of their not taking full advantage of the facilities given them by Government and partly maintained out of their contribution. With proper working of the Act large as well as small vendors being sampled and proper production of cases before the Magistrates I have little doubt that the fines realized would more than cover the municipal contributions. There have been two appeals to the High Court from convictions obtained under the Prevention of Adulteration Act. The grounds of appeal in both cases involved technical points connected with the regulations made under the Act. In one case a ghee merchant (Madras City) who had been convicted of selling ghee containing a large proportion of foreign fat was successful in his appeal. In another case the conviction of a dealer (Kumbakonam) who sold "French Coffee" which was found to contain chicory was upheld. New regulations which it is hoped will be less liable to misconstruction have been drafted, and will, it is anticipated, be officially adopted in the very near future. SAMPLES FROM AREAS NOT WORKING THE ACT. Four samples, two of ghee and two of coffee powder were received from the District Health Officer, Kistna. The samples of ghee were adulterated with 70 and 45 per cent of foreign fat. One sample of coffee was genuine and the other was adulterated with 60 per cent chicory. MISCELLANEOUS SAMPLES. One hundred and fifteen samples of drugs and prescribed medicines and 195 samples of foods were received from the various Government institutions. In the case of drugs I allow a tolerance of 10 per cent error in dispensing. Mixtures in which the error in dispensing an essential ingredient exceeds this amount are classed as adulterated. Only thirteen samples (11 per cent) were 5 -A
36 REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST TO THE GOVT. OF MADRAS certified as inaccurately dispensed. This figure shows that there has been a great improvement since sampling commenced. Thirty-six per cent of the samples submitted in 1929-30 were condemned. The food samples consisted of milk, bread, butter, ghee, coffee, tea, sugar and gingelly oil. Five samples of milk were adulterated with added water vary- ing from 8 to 40 per cent. Five samples of ghee contained foreign fat in amounts between 15 and 70 per cent. Two samples of coffee were added with 25 and 27 per cent of chicory. Five sugars were found inferior in quality. Two samples of gingelly oil consisted entirely of arachis (groundnut) oil while a third contained 60 per cent arachis. Two butters contained excess water of 7.6 and 18.8 per cent respectively, KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY, 15th February 1932. HERBERT HAWLEY, M.SC., F.I.C., Public Analyst to the Government.

The vendor who added cane sugar was fined Rs. 10 and the other two Rs. 15 each. Of the rest, nine were fined from Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 and one case was withdrawn. Two samples of tea were adulterated with 50 and 40 per cent of imitation tea. The vendors were prosecuted and fined Rs. 15 and Rs. 10 respectively. Two butters contained a small excess of water. The vendors were cautioned. Eight samples of gingelly oil were adulterated with arachis (groundnut) oil in amounts varying from 15 to 60 per cent. All the vendors were prosecuted and fined from Rs. 5 to Rs. 25.

No. 779, 6th April 1932 Administration Report2 No. 779, P.H., 6TH APRIL 1932 6. The Madras Prevention of Adulteration Act, 1918, was in force in the Madras City, 15 municipalities and one panchayat board area. The number of samples submitted to the Public Analyst was 2,091 of which 1,777 were submitted under the Act, four were sent by local bodies in whose area the Act was not in force and the remaining 310 consisted of articles of food and drug received from Government hospitals and institutions. 7. The largest number of samples was received from the Madras City (883). A fair number was sent by the municipalities of Vizagapatam (178), Madura (125), Trichinopoly (102), and Rajahmundry (101). The number received from the munici- palities of Mangalore (19) and Nellore (11), and the Mettupalaiyam Panchayat (15) was extremely poor. The Proddatur and Karaikudi municipalities did not send any samples. In the former case, considerable time was spent in corre- spondence relating to the conditions of the working of the Act. The Chairman, Municipal Council, Karaikudi, is requested to report why no samples were sent. 8. Out of the 1,777 samples submitted under the Act, 43 per cent were adulterated. The percentage of adulteration was the highest in Kumbakonam (66). Next came Madras and Mettupalaiyam (53), Virudhunagar (52), Coimba- tore (49) and Vizagapatam (48). Several prosecutions were launched under the Act by the local bodies. In 371 cases the accused were convicted and fined. The experience gained during the year shows the necessity for working the Act more vigorously than hitherto. Local bodies are, therefore, requested to give their earnest attention to this matter. They should systematically send samples to the Public Analyst and launch prosecutions in all cases of proved adulteration of articles of food. 9. The question of a wider application of the Act and the steps to be taken to bring the Act into more effective operation is under the consideration of the Government.

Lymph production.3 REPORT OF THE KING NSTITUTE, GUINDY the Indian Research Fund Association. Cholera bacteriophage was also supplied to some of the districts where cholera occurred particularly to Ganjam. Cholera bacterio- phage at first comprised Asheshov's three types A, B and C, but towards the end of August 1932 and early in September three more types which we call D, E-1 and E-2 isolated by Lieut.-Col. J. Morison, I.M.S., and Capt C. L. Pasricha, I.M.S. (to both of whom we are greatly indebted), were incorporated in our Bacteriophage mixture. During the 5 months ending with September 1932, 98,000 c.c. of cholera bacteriophage were manufactured and bulbed, of which 81,540 c.c. were issued. The entire supply was made to the Public Health Department. To test its presence in supplies to which it was added, 33 samples of water were ex- amined. All these came from the Pushkaram festival area. No cholera followed this festi- val, but just as one swallow does not make a summer, so here we may not yet attribute this absence of cholera to the effect of the use of bacteriophage. Its manufacture is being continued and time will show whether the spreading about of bacteriophage does, as is hoped, greatly diminish the prevalence of cholera. 5. Media and miscellaneous supplies.4 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY sampled as noted in Table VI which briefly records the results. The results for jails and railway stations are not included in this table this year as they are not of sufficient importance to warrant their publication. The following protected water-supplies call for special mention on account of the unsatis- factory nature of the supply. While the number thus pilloried is definitely less than last year, several hardy annuals are still included, as can be seen from the number of those starred which indicates that deficien- cies have been frequently commented on in the past.

Sitarama Ayyar, the Institute Zoologist, visited Bellary in November 1931 and Mysore State in March-April 1932 for rat-flea surveys. 4. Mr. T. N. S. Raghavachari investigated a plague rat-fall at Tiruvallur. Infected fleas were most probably imported in yarn from Bangalore. 5.

Most samples were examined fully, chemically and bacteriologically, but the details are not given in order to avoid taking up space. Since on the whole the presence of lactose fermenters is the most important criterion, it alone is here recorded. In the columns headed dates and results, first the date of examination is given and then the minimum number of cubic centimeters of water in which lactose fermenters could be found. When these were absent in 60 c.c. the mark>is written before 60 to indicate that the minimum quantity was something greater than 60 c.c. Unless otherwise stated, filters refer to slow sand filters.

(SUPPLEMENT TO THE REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY.) (Called for by G.O. No. 142, P.H., dated 22nd January 1930, and Mis. No. 2516, P.H., dated 8th Ootober 1930.) I have the honour to report as under on the working of the Prevention of Adulteration Act in the Madras Presidency during the period 1st October 1931 to 30th September 1932. I held the office of the Public Analyst to Government until 9th March 1932, when I proceeded home on leave for 8 months. During my absence M.R.Ry. K. V. Sundaram Ayyar Avargal, M.Sc., my Senior Assistant, officiated for me and my Junior Assistant Mr. S. Narayana Ayyar, M.A., worked as Senior Assistant. Mr. V. Venkatachalam, M.A., the Public Analyst, appointed by the Corporation of Madras, continued his training and worked. under me as an assistant. Samples under the Prevention of Adultera- tion Act.18 REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST TO THE GOVT. OF MADRAS TABLE 119 REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST TO THE GOVT. OF MADRAS Table No. 2 shows that there has been a definite increase in the fines inflicted under the Act following comments which were made in my last Annual Report. Thus the average fine for the whole Presidency has increased from Rs. 9 to Rs. 13. In several municipali- ties fines inflicted are still very much too low for them to have any real deterrent effect. In some of these cases I have called the at- tention of the District Magistrates to the matter and they have been pleased to issue instructions, which it is hoped, will cause an improvement in the future. A number of further points arising from the particulars given in these two tables calls for comment. The percentage of adultera- tion has fallen from 43 to 35, largely as a result of adulteration in Madras City20 REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST TO THE GOVT. OF MADRAS In every case where a local dealer had been convicted, further samples have been taken and the results show that, by following up a man in this way, it is possible to compel him to sell genuine articles. He has given me instances of 16 vendors who have been sampled repeatedly and in some cases as many as seven times. In almost every case after two or more convictions, in one case four, and generally with an increased fine subsequent samples have been found to be genuine. I understand that in some cases this regular sampling of the same vendor has been represented as something in the nature of persecution. It is nothing of the sort. Food vendors who made this complaint were, I think, under the impression that having been caught and having paid a fine they were entitled to immunity for some time, in fact they looked on paying a fine as, to some extent, a licence to sell adulterated food. The Health Officers throughout the Presi- dency should realize that it is not the object of the Act to collect money in the way of fines, but to improve the quality of the food supplied to the public and, though it may be a long time before it is possible to rely on obtaining genuine articles from petty dealers, I do not consider that there should be any difficulty whatever in driving the bigger dealers into supplying unadulterated food. Various defences have been put up when cases have been heard. One of the most popular is that the article was sold as received from the wholesaler. Unless such an article is sold in an original sealed container this defence should be received with great caution. If the matter be investigated it will usually be found that the retail dealer had paid something less than the normal price of a genuine article so that he should, at the very least, have been suspicious. In other cases, as for instance, where a man dealing regularly in a certain food sells such a food containing a high percentage of adulterant, the defence is merely ridiculous. It is inconceivable that a regular vendor of coffee, for example, could not know by appearance and taste that his supply contained a considerable proportion of chicory. In cases of real doubt a substantial retailer has a simple remedy in his hands. He should deal with a reputable wholesaler and obtain a written guarantee that the article supplied is pure. Alternatively he should arrange with his wholesaler to pay in arrears deducting any fines from the wholesaler's account. The Municipal Health Officer at Ootacamund informs me that some of the retail dealers there have made arrangements on these lines with their wholesale dealers and that subse- quently they have had no difficulty whatever in getting a genuine article. I understand that similar action has been taken by some of the ghee sellers in Madras City. Another defence which has been put for- ward is that coffee hotels and restaurants are entitled to add water to milk which they keep for supply to customers either in coffee or as a separate article. This defence is only available when the vendor can prove that in no circumstances is he prepared to supply milk alone. The Act as amended now says that the Court may presume that " any food found in the possession of a person who is in the habit of storing like articles of food for sale has been stored by such person for sale." Accordingly when milk is found in the possession of a hotel-keeper who is in the habit of selling milk as such there can be no question that a prosecution lies. The addition of water to milk prepared for sale is now prohibited in the rules made under the Act, and neither declaration nor labelling is any defence. TABLE 3.

Madras Cor- poration pay a contribution of Rs. 5,000 per year to Government. It will be seen that this has been more than recovered in fines. Coimbatore and Ootacamund have more than covered their contribution of Rs. 720. In other municipalities a substantial proportion of the contribution (Rs. 720) has been realized. If, as is hoped, there is a considera- ble rise in the average fine next year, no municipality should have any difficulty in recovering at least its contribution to Govern- ment.
21 REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST TO THE GOVT. OF MADRAS MISCELLANEOUS SAMPLES. Fifty-nine samples of drugs and prescribed medicines and 179 samples of foods were received from various Government Insti- tutions. Three samples of tea and a sample of menthol were received from private bodies. In the case of drugs a tolerance of 10 per cent error is allowed. Mixtures in which the error in dispensing an essential ingredient exceeds this amount are classed as adulte- rated. Eight mixtures were certified as inaccurately dispensed. The food samples were sent for examination in connexion with either tender or contractors' supplies to various Government Institutions. They consisted of milk, bread, butter, ghee, coffee, tea, sugar and gingelly oil. Seven samples of milk were adulterated with added water varying from 6 to 40 per cent. In 29 samples of bread the acidity was found to be higher than the prescribed limit. Six samples of ghee were adulterated with foreign fat in amounts varying from 20 to 95 per cent. Three samples of tea contained foreign leaf between 20 to 30 per cent. One sample of gingelly oil contained 80 per cent groundnut oil. One sample of butter contained water slightly in excess of the prescribed standard. One sugar was found to be inferior in quality. Addendum. Since going to press, particulars have been received of eight convictions in Madras City, the total amount of the fines imposed being Rs. 270. The case pending in Calicut resulted in a conviction with a fine of Rs. 30. THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY, Dated 15th February 1933.

No. 824, P.H., 10th April 1933 Administration Report2 No. 824, P.H., 10TH APRIL 1933 6. The provisions of the Madras Prevention of Adulteration Act, 1918, were extended to the Salem Municipality during the year. The number of samples submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis under the Act increased from 1,777 to 3,183. Besides these, 238 samples of food and drugs were also received from Government institutions and four from private bodies. The largest number of samples was received, as in the previous year, from the Madras City (1,157). The number received from most of the local bodies approximated to the maximum (180) which they are entitled to have analysed, though the number was poor in the case of Proddatur (26), Karaikudi (53), Salem (71) and the M&#275;ttup&#257;laiyam Panchayat Board (35). 7. Of the samples submitted under the Act 35 per cent were adulterated as compared with 43 per cent in the previous year. The percentage of adulteration was highest in Mangalore (66). Next came Salem (59), Ootacamund (50), Karaikudi (49), M&#275;ttup&#257;laiyam (48) and Coimbatore (47). There were 876 convictions under the Act and fines to the extent of Rs. 10,652 were realized. The attention of the local bodies concerned is invited to the remarks of the Public Analyst in regard to the necessity for taking samples frequently from those who have once been found to sell adulterated food. 8. Revised rules under the Act were issued. during the year. The question of extend- ing the Act to certain other local areas and the steps to be taken for working the Act more efficiently are still under the consideration of the Government.
