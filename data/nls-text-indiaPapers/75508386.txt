ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN INDIA FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1902-03. CONTENTS. PART I.ii IV.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN INDIA FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1902-03. PART I.-IMPERIAL REPORT. I2 Prices paid for each class. 7. The average prices paid for horses purchased in India, were3 Sale of rejected stallions. 15. Table IV furnishes all necessary particulars referring to 5 horses and 5 donkeys sold during the year. Of the horses, 1 was sold to the Alwar State for stud purposes, 1 being a bad foal getter, and 3 being unfit for employment as sires. Castration. 16. A satisfactory increase is shown in the number of colts castrated dur- ing the year by Veterinary Assistants paid from Imperial and Provincial Funds. Table XI shows that 2,485 colts were castrated against 2,395 in the previous year. Number of branded mares. 17. The year under report opened with a balance of 20,539 branded mares on the Registers and closed with 21,911. The number branded by the officers of this Department amounted to 2,764 against 2,041 in the previous year, show- ing a satisfactory increase of 723. Number of mares covered by stalli- ons. 18. As shown in Table V, there has been a steady increase in the number of mares covered by Government stallions during the last three years. In 1900-01 the number served was 14,000. Last year, it amounted to 14,604, and in the year under report, the figures have reached 15,234, which must be looked upon as satisfactory, considering the imperfect and unreliable agency through which these particulars are furnished. Average coverings per stallions em- ployed. 19. The average of mares covered per stallion is still more satisfactory. The figures shown are 56 against 52.15 in the previous year. The increase of 3.85 mares per horse when the actual number of stallions at stud work was less than the number employed last year by nearly 8 horses, indicates that the services of the stallions were better utilized. Produce. 20. The reported foalings, as shown in Table V, also show a satisfactory increase; the numbers being 3,873 against 3,391 in the previous year. The average number of foals produced per stallion employed, has also risen from 11.65 in 1901-02 to 13.83 in the year under report. 21. I would repeat the remarks made in paragraph 24 of last year's Ad- ministration Report, that no reliance can be placed on the produce Returns. Various methods of obtaining accurate statistics under this head, have been tried, but I am convinced that the figures rendered are as unreliable as they have always been. Our District Establishment who furnish this information, is so insufficient that it is not possible for one man posted to a district consist- ing of several hundred square miles, to travel and personally ascertain the results of each mare covered. Country-bred Re- mounts purchased. 22. As shown in Table VI, there is a decrease in the number of remounts purchased; the total number bought being 1,293 against 1,433 in the previous year. The only branch of the service which shows an increase over last year's figures, is the "Imperial Service Troops", the number purchased being 100 against 25 in the previous year; there is a decrease in all the other branches of the service as shown below :4 General Statement of the cost of the Department. 25. Table XVIII shows that the cost of the Department during the year under report, amounted to Rs. 6,87,191-14-11 against Rs. 6,56,620-11-8, giving an increase of Rs. 30,571-3-3. The principal increases appear under the heads of "Prizes", "Contingencies", and "Purchase of stallions". The cause of increase under "Prizes" is due to a greater number of Fairs being held than in the previous year, and also to the award of prizes for the en- couragement of cattle-breeding. The increase under "Contingencies" is chiefly due to the purchase of chemicals and expensive apparatus for the Muk- tesar Bacteriological Laboratory. The rise under the head of "Purchase of stallions" is accounted for by the fact that higher prices had to be paid for the Arabs purchased in Bombay to secure the stamp of horse required. 26. The prices paid for imported horse and donkey stallions during the year under report, were as shown below:5 American donkeys.6 Mules purchased. 38. There is a decided falling off in the total number of mules purchased for Government purposes; the number being 818 against 1,421 in the previous year. The number secured by the Army Remount Department shows a satis- factory increase, 606 having been purchased against 210 in the previous year; but those bought by the Supply and Transport Corps and by Native Cavalry Regiments for transport purposes, fell from 1,211 in 1901-02 to only 212 in the year under report. III7 HORSE AND MULE-BREEDING IN NATIVE STATES. 46. The usual statement, as furnished to this office, of horse and mule- breeding carried on by Native States, is given below :8 GOVERNMENT CATTLE FARM HISSAR. 53. This is the fourth year that the Farm has been under the management of the Civil Veterinary Department. 54. Cows.9 64. Thirty (30) of the original mules bought to commence the scheme were cast and sold at a profitable price, as it was considered that they would not grow sufficiently to be of any use for Ordnance purposes. 65. The scheme commences to bear fruit next year, when 120 mules will be ready for the service and 100 in each succeeding year. 66. Donkey-breeding and Rearing.10 deterioration it will be necessary to adopt measures to keep the temperature as near 85º Fahr. as possible. The experimental pits which were established at Lahore and Nagpur (two of the hottest places in India) recorded a maxi- mum temperature of 90º and 84.5º Fahr., respectively. I therefore anticipate no difficulty in being able to establish Depôts, at a trifling cost, in any part of India where the serum will retain its full protective power. 74. Cattle from the districts of Lucknow, Jalaun, Meerut and Moradabad were experimented upon with a view of ascertaining the correct dose of serum required for these breeds. The results were satisfactory and proved that the standard dose issued from the Laboratory confers immunity on the breeds of cattle of those districts. 75. Experiments were carried out at Muktesar and Bareilly by the Im- perial Bacteriologist on the following diseases, full details of which are given in his Annual Report :11 82. Staff and Establishment.12 89. It was found necessary to destroy 16 Government horse and donkey stallions found to be suffering from the disease, and the necessary measures for its suppression have been adopted. Cleansing of horse- boxes and cattle- trucks. 90. A slight increase is noticeable in the number of horse boxes and cattle- trucks inspected, viz., 588 against 454 last year. These inspections have been productive of much good, as they have caused the Railway Authorities to adopt systematic measures for the cleansing and disinfecting of all vehicles which carry animals. PART II.-PROVINCIAL REPORT. I13 The cost of feed and keep of these animals (as shown in Table XII, Provincial) averaged Rs. 156-6-3 per annum against Rs. 169-9-3 in the previous year. Number of mares covered. 99. A very satisfactory increase in the number of mares covered will be observed by reference to Table VII (Provincial):14 104. Rinderpest.15 113. The number shown as employed in work "connected with horse and mule-breeding "will be considerably reduced, as the majority have been trans- ferred to the Army Remount Department since 1st April 1903. 114. The increase in the number employed in cattle-breeding and cattle disease work, is satisfactory, but is still short16 CATTLE-BREEDING. 121.
