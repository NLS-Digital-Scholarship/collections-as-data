I am inclined to think that this tendency to suppuration and ulceration is particularly developed in patients with scorbutic taint. Rheumatism is one of the diseases which gives most trouble in native regiments. It is so easy to feign pain, and so difficult to say positively that it does not exist, that it is one of the most common forms of malingering; but many cases occur where the scorbutic taint so marks the disease that there can be no doubt of its existence; these cases are marked by swelling of the joints, hardening of the muscles with contraction of the flexors; they are gene- rally very obstinate, and seem to be best treated by the combination of iodide of potassium with chlorate of potash, lime-juice, &c. Occasionally cases of general arthritic rheumatism with a considerable amount of fever occur, and these, I find, yield most readily to alkaline treatment, with the use of woollens, the patient not being allowed to use any other kind of clothing. Scurvy. 4 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. notice on previous occasions, that I should have thought it unnecessary to do more than men- tion it; but, unfortunately, no steps have been taken to remedy the nuisance by either Govern- ment or the Municipality, and it is undoubtedly growing worse and worse every year. During the last two years it has been the subject of constant representations from the Esplanade Board of Health; and at the end of November the stench was for several days so intolerably offensive, that a special Medical Committee was appointed by the Brigadier-General to enquire and report upon the nuisance. From my own observation, having visited the outlet of the drain five times within the last month, I am satisfied that the stench arises from the deposit of insoluble sewage, brought down by the Sonapoor drain on the rocks and sands forming the foreshore of Back Bay, and though it might be modified in some degree by carrying the drain to the extreme limit of low water spring tides (60 or 70 yards beyond its present outlet), I believe that this would only be a slight palliation, and that the only complete remedy will be found in the diversion of the drain, and so preventing sewage from being carried into the quiet waters of Back Bay, where circumstances are so favourable for its retention, deposit, and exposure. The water-supply is good in quality and quantity from the Vehar lake and wells. The rainfall during the year was inches 81 and cents 95. In the hospital a new ward has been formed by taking off 20 feet from that occupied by the lascars and details. A bathing-room is in course of construction in the east end of the north verandah, and a covered passage from the hospital to the latrines; these will be com- pleted in a few days, and will be a material improvement to the hospital.

BOMBAY.PRESIDENCY DIVISION, ADEN, AND BOMBAY MARINE. 5 The principal disease treated has been ague, of which there have been 14 cases. One, a particularly obstinate one that had been sent from Rajkote to Hindoostan on sick leave, was away for nearly a year, came to Bombay on his way to Aden, was under treatment here for four months, and was at last brought before a special committee and invalided. Two cases of leprosy occurred, both in men, who were invalided. The details are quartered in the Esplanade peudalls, a tolerably healthy situation, but rather damp in the monsoon, at which time, however, there are seldom many of them in Bombay. SANITARY REPORT OF THE SENIOR MEDICAL OFFICER ON THE HEALTH OF THE NATIVE TROOPS IN THE BOMBAY GARRISON DURING THE YEAR 1872. The troops in Garrison have been as follows:6 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. Re-vaccinated 397, successful 150, unsuccessful 247. The only new building in the lines has been a blacksmith's shop in those of the 21st, and no change has been made in the drainage. At the end of December 1871, in consequence of the filthy stench experienced in the lines of the 19th Regiment N. I., from the close vicinity of the public latrines and other nuisances, the regiment was moved into tents, near the Esplan- ade pendalls, where they remained until 11th March 1872. During this time the huts and lines were thoroughly cleaned. Nothing can be added to the statement made in the Sanitary report for 1871 and previous years, as to the unfitness of these lines for the occupation of troops. The house drainage of the lines of the 21st Regiment has been under review during the year. In September, Surgeon Seward sent in a very long and elaborate report, and in Novem- ber, a committee composed of the Commandants of the 21st and 19th Regiments, the Deputy Inspector General, Indian Medical Department, the Executive Engineer, Presidency, and the Medical Officer of the 21st Regiment, sat and reported on the subject. It is undoubtedly very defective and likely to increase in some degree the unhealthiness of the lines. The lines of the detachment of the 11th Regiment were found so unhealthy from their very damp condition, and the close proximity of the latrines and sweepers' lines, that it was deemed necessary to remove the men to the Esplanade pendalls in July, where they have remained ever since. The water-supply is good, that for drinking being from the Vehar lake, that for washing is obtained from wells in the lines of both regiments. The principal diseases have been fever, chiefly ague, rheumatism, diarrhPRESIDENCY DIVISION, ADEN, AND BOMBAY MARINE. 7 TABLE showing Strength, Treated, Deaths, Average Daily Sick of the Native Troops in Garrison in Bombay, during 1870, 1871, 1872.

So as there were no available houses, and tents could not be pitched, the ground being so damp that it would have been prejudicial to the health of the sick, under these circumstances they were accommodated in all the available spaces that could be made use of, and although there was much overcrowding for some time, yet no bad result came from it. The admissions from rheumatism and syphilis require no remarks. There have been three admissions from scurvyPRESIDENCY DIVISION, ADEN, AND BOMBAY MARINE. 11 The following is said to be the usual ration of a single man in the regiment. I place beside it, the ration found to be sufficient for the prisoners in the Bombay Jail:12 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. The rainfall this year amounted to 86 inches, 6 cents, which is rather less than the usual quantity. It was peculiar that the rains fell extremely heavy in June and July, in August and September scarcely any, and none in October. During the month of May, and beginning of June, there was a great scarcity of water, so much so that I had to supply the sepoys from some of the Jail garden wells. HER MAJESTY'S 26TH REGIMENT N.I. SURAT.PRESIDENCY DIVISION, ADEN, AND BOMBAY MARINE. 13 During the outbreak there where 345 admissions, giving an' average number of six days: under treatment; beside these a few suffered from mild attacks, and consequently did not pre- sent themselves at hospital. As a rule the disease exhausted itself in the first attack, however, it will be seen from an analysis of the total admissions, that a second attack occasionally happened, but that a third or fourth was of rare occurrence. Of the 345 admissions, 274 men were admitted once, 32 twice, 1 three times, 1 four times; making a total of 345. The leading characteristic symptoms of this disease are, severe fever usually preceded by lassitude and headache, and followed by pain and stiffness of the joints, especially those of the knee, shoulder, and fingers; the fever is, in most instances, attended with foul dirty tongue, bitter taste in mouth, and almost complete aversion to food; constipation, nausea, and vomit- ing are occasionally present in some instances14 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. One case was treated during the collapse with hydrate of chloral in 15 grs. doses, every 2nd hour With satisfactory results. The treatment generally pursued in cholera was adopted in the others. Thirteen cases of guineaworm were admitted during the year; these were chiefly recruits, who had joined from Koncan and Deccan. The remaining diseases were generally of an ordinary nature; and require no special remarks There were ten (10) deaths among those under treatment during the year; three of these occurred on the march from Nasirabad. Two deaths resulted from ague, one on the line of march, and the other about two months after arrival in Surat; both these cases suffered severely from ague in Nasirabad. Two cases of remittent fever proved fatal on the march. Two deaths occurred from cholera. The causes of the remaining four deaths were, respee- tively, dysentery, phthisis, pneumonia, and chronic rheumatism with complicated scurvy. One sepoy of the regiment died in Bombay, he had been invalided for, chronic bronchitis and general debility. The, lines and subsidiary buildings are in good condition, and the, huts generally afford sufficient accommodation for the inmates, however, the ventilation is slightly defective. Each sepoy's hut is 15 feet 3 inches high, 10 long, and 9 broad, exclusive of the verandah. The general sanitary condition of the lines and regimental latrines is good. The maidan on the southern and eastern sides of the lines is full of holesPRESIDENCY DIVISION, ADEN, AND BOMBAY MARINE. 15 The cases of hepatitis, dysentery, and diarrh16 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. rocks, and the salt is removed on camels' backs to the sea-shore for being shipped. The working of these rocks has formed large and extensive caves- going in various directions into the interior of the rocks; these are of various depths, and are situated at various heights the sides of the rocks. The working of these cases is hazardous and full of danger; sometimes the roof or the sides of these caves fall in, burying alive the labourers. In some parts of these rocks, there are mines which yield very transparent pieces of rock-salt. Large quantities of salt are carried by country boats to Muscat and other ports. There aré some sulphurous springs right opposite to the Bassadore station, but situated on the Persian Coast; there being a channel of sea-water about 7 miles in width between it and Bassadore. The spring itself is situated very far into the interior of the chain of rocks, but the stream of the water flows through a deep and narrow, winding ravine, formed no doubt by a gigantic splitting of the rocks in ages gone by, until it emerges on the, sea-shore where it looses itself into the sea. The water is charged with common salt (which may be seen deposited along the sides of the stream), and sulphuretted hydrogen gas, and holds a little free sulphur. On the Persian Coast about 30 miles from Bassadore in a north-eastern direction, there is a place called Khamir. In the rocks in its neighbourhood there are. sulphur mines.Sulphur is thus extracted from its.ore. The ore of sulphur which principally consists of clay (white), and sulphur is dug out of the rocks. The ore is then heaped over shallow excavations made for the purpose in the neighbourhood of the mines, the heaps are then set fire to when, the sulphur melts out of its ore and collects in the hollows, where it subsequently solidifies, and is then removed in large pieces. The workers of these mines loose nearly ½ of the sulphur in their attempts to melt out the sulphur, by thus setting fire to the ore in open air Not far from these mines, there are some hot sulphurous springs of water. They are highly charged with sulphuretted hydrogen gas, so that the gas is smelt distinctly at the distance of a mile from these springs, the water also holds a little free sulphur. There are four or five springs situated close to one another, all of them are hot with the exception of a small one, which is quite cold, though situated close to the others. These sulphurous and other mineral springs, I have described briefly above, are resorted: to by most of the natives of these and distant parts, whenevér they have some lingering and troublesome affection, be it phthisis, fever, rheumatism, or syphilis, and some of them attribute wonderful cures to these mineral baths; but how far their statements are to be relied upon is a different question altogether. But the generality of these natives seem to have a great faith in the beneficial effects of these baths. The most prevailing diseases among the natives of these parts, are malarious fevers, enlarged spleen, phthisisPRESIDENCY DIVISION,ADN, AND BOMBAY MARINE. 17 cases of lumbago, ague, asthma, and gonorrh18 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY.

Fifteen years ago the population was estimated at 25,000, and it was believed that an in- crease had taken place since then; but, according to the census taken on 21st February 1872, the total only amounted to 22,000, and was made up as follows:PRESIDENCY DIVISION, ADEN, AND BOMBAY MARINE. 19 July, were 88° 5', 94° 1', and 93°1.

Certainly, however, to send severe scorbutic cases off at once would be the kindest way to the patients, and, possibly, not the least economical to Government, as the services of the men are lost, whether they go or remain; but when away, there is, of course, a considerable saving in the matter of rations, batta, and hospital extras. Invalids. Of the invalids, 48 in number, only two were short service men, one being discharged on the recommendation of a special medical board on account of imbeci- lity, and the other, suffering from permanent debility, was disposed of by the Annual Invaliding Committee; the former had served 8, and the latter 6 years. The following table shows the average age, service, and cause of disability of those who were inva- lided on pension. Cause of Disability. Number. Average Age. Average Service.

The present system of granting pension ap- pears to be radically wrong, and leads to a great deal of scheming and occasional malingering. The causes of death, and the ages and length of service of those who died were as follows:PRESIDENCY DIVISION, ADEN, AND BOMBAY MARINE. 23 Besides the ordinary uniform, the men are provided with loose serge coats, a great im- provement on the tunic, and during the hot season, white clothing was worn. The boots, however well looked after, are simply instruments of torture on the march, especially, in the case of men with a scorbutic taint. Vaccination. The primary vaccination during the year, were 34 in number, being 1 more than the number vaccinated in 1871. Since the regiment arrived at Aden, 360 sepoys of all ages taken indiscriminately have been re-vaccinated. The following shows the result of the operation during 1872:24 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. The following statement shows the admissions according to disease:PRESIDENCY DIVISION, ADEN, AND BOMBAY MARINE. 25 One man was invalided for inguinal hernia. Besides the man who died on sick leave one man died suddenly of fatty degeneration of the heart.

During the year under report, scurvy and ague have been the chief diseases for which sick leave has been granted. Diseases of the chest and chronic rheumatism follow. Only three deaths are shown to have occurred amongst those thus sent away. The greatest amount of leave granted has been for 7 months against 12 of the previous year. The greatest duration of disease in hospital, previous to recommending sick leave, was for 10 months in a case of inflammation of the earPRESIDENCY DIVISION, ADEN, AND BOMBAY MARINE. 31 This table shows a decrease in the admissions from fever in the 19th, 21st, and 26th Regi- ments.

The following table gives a percentage of admissions to strength, and admissions to teated from intermittent fever, contrasted with those of the charges which remained in the division in the preceding year:32 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. 24. This contrasts favourably with the out of hospital deaths of the previous year; the percentage to strength being as follows:PRESIDENCY DIVISION, ADEN, AND BOMBAY MARINE. 33 28. The Medical Officer of the 21st Regiment N. I., Surgeon-Major Mills, shows in his report, that the sickness of the regiment was somewhat in excess of the previous year; it is, however, to be noticed that fever cases had decreased. Surgeon-Major Mills has forwarded a table which shows, as regards this regiment, that in 1863 the average daily sick was 14, and in 1872 it was 19. During this period of ten years it had fluctuated, the highest being 37 in 1865. In 1863, there were 6 cases of cholera, in 1864, 20, and in 1865, 13, since -which year no case of cholera appears in the returns of the regiment. From the table we must conclude that the health of the regiment, as regards pronounced disease, has improved since 1864, though it is to be noticed, that in 1863, there were fewer treated than in any year since; in this year, however, there were 6 cases of cholera, all of whom died. It is possible that decrease of board of ship service has reduced the amount of disease, and that Vehar: water and line sanitation have likewise had a powerful influence. If good and plentiful food and more purity of air could be added, the physique of the men would not be, what it is stated to be, below " par." At one period of the year, the hospital accommodation was found to be insufficient; the sick of the detachment of the 11th Regiment N. I., were, therefore, ordered to be treated in the more commodious hospital of the 19th Regiment. A bathroom has been. built at each end of the hospital verandah, and a covered way made to the latrine. The Hut drainage system of these lines, has, in addition to being brought to notice in my last year's report, now engaged the attention of the Brigadier-General, who called on the Me- dical Officer in charge, then Surgeon Seward, M.D., to report upon it. At my recent annual inspection, two of the tubs or barrels were opened, a portion of the earth taken out, enclosed in closely fitting tin canisters, and forwarded to the Chemical Analyser to Government, whose report has been forwarded to the Brigadier-General with certain suggestions for the early change of the present system; and as an addendum to the report of a mixed committee, which was convened to take the subject into consideration, Mr. Lyon's report was forwarded on the 15th ultimo. The health of the detachment of the regiment does not call for much remark. The Sub- Assistant Surgeon's account of the island of Kishin, would show it to be an extremely malarious place. 29. The 26th Regiment N. I. is gradually recovering from a long continuance of ill health, which appeared to culminate on its being subjected to dengue, which passed from the city to the camp. The regiment marched into Nasirabad at the end of 1870, having been pre- viously quartered at Baroda. During their stay at Nasirabad, the regiment suffered greatly from fever; in the year 1871, 1,311 cases were admitted, while in 1872, quartered in Surat, where the regiment arrived by wings in January and March, only 748 cases were entered. Cholera appeared in the month of August, having, notwithstanding all precautions, passed from the city: 13 cases occurred, of whom 4 were soldiers, and 2 of whom died. It is very neces- sary that a shed should be erected for the reception and treatment of contagious and infectious disease, and I have submitted a suggestion to this effect to the Major-General Commanding. Assistant Surgeon McConaghy, M.D., in medical charge, has sent, with his annual report, one on the dengue as it appeared in this regiment. When I inspected the hospital, lines, &c., the men were, to all appearance, rapidly recovering health and strength. 30. The lascars of the Grand Arsenal and Gun Carriage Department have lines in Lower Colaba; these are located unfortunately with regard to sanitary conditions; closed or blocked in on all sides, ventilation is of the most imperfect description; they have, close in front of them one of those municipal features of the city, a large latrine, the stench from which, even to lascars, is a source of disquet and abhorrence. The sweepers' lines, too, are close to them. I found in the lines themselves little to complain of. During the rains, when a few cases of cholera, appeared, there was a state of affairs of a very objectionable character reported on by Surgeon Seward. The officers and men with whom I spoke all complained of the place, and begged my intercession for their removal. This will probably form part of a question for native soldiers' accommodation in Bombay. For the present, prevention of overcrowding by family visitors from the districts should be most carefully attended to, as much as the cleanliness of the lines themselves. When I inspected the lines, many children were found unvaccinated; they had recently arrived with other family members from their villages. These people surreptitiously find lodgings in places already all too small, and doubtless, at times, bring with them those diseases it is the endeavour by careful attention to prevent. To this cause was to be attri- buted the cholera in the rains. The lascars have a considerable strength, averaging during the year 453.

Several alterations have been made from time to time since the conversion of the cholera- shed into the lock hospital; the last and best is that of 1872, the raising of the floor and so preventing its being flooded in the rains. At my inspection. I found the building (hut) perfectly clean as well as the outhouses. There were no patients, but 8 or 9 prostitutes were on the register. The hospital requires protection: vide accompanying " remarks." It is possi- ble the establishment of this hospital may have the effect of deterring diseased women from frequenting Deolalee. It is, however, remarkable that the registered number should be so far above the greatest number examined, while fines levied under the Act amount to only one rupee. Dr. Semple, in medical charge, considers, and I quite agree with him, that the ab- sence of the police renders the Act " quite inoperative." At the period of my visit there was not a single patient, and the average in hospital was 0.90 composed of two women, whose diseases were connected with venereal. Dr. Semple throws out a suggestion which, in my opinion, is worthy of the attention of the Inspector General; it is that the lock hospital should be utilized as a dispensary, and thus the employment of a hospital assistant would be more than nominal, and a want supplied. Dr. Semple suggests that, with a room set apart for the reception of venereal disease, the hospital might receive out-patients of whom there would probably be a considerable number. Should the proposal meet with approval further enquiries might be instituted; at present it is simply a suggestion for making some use of a place and a hospital assistantSTATEMENT.

The exceptions, as regards the thoroughly improved character of the year's healthi- ness was in intermitent fever in the Aden troop, in the 1st Company Native Artillery, and in the Perim detachment. This disease in the Aden troop, which gave 72 cases more than in the previous year, may be attributed to the patrolling duty in a presumed malarious tract of country, during the early part of the year. Intermittent fever in the Native Artillery .42 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. There is no doubts that a small hospital is necessary, and the subject has been brought to the notice of the Brigadier-General, by whom, however, it had been previously under considera- tion. The 1st company of Native Artillery, occupy lines near Steamer Point, which were in good order; the appearance of the men was fairly healthy. The sick are treated in a ward of the European soldiers' hospital, and are attended to by its establishment under the medical care of the Assistant Surgeon, British Medical Service, in-charge Steamer Point. The medical history of the departmental followers at Aden, Ordnance and Commissariat; shows that the lines of the former are of the worst description; and it is advisable that fresh lines, arranged with reference to ventilation and sanitation in general, should be built. These lines of huts are erected by the men themselves, and present the appearance more of a tempo- rary hut-village of wanderersPRESIDENCY DIVISION, ADEN, AND BOMBAY MARINE. 43 The rainfall is uncertain; the greatest fall during the last 10 years was 7 inches in 1870, and the least was in 1871, when 34 cents only were registered. In 1872, 1 inch 26 cents fell at the camp. Vaccination in the various military charges has been carried on, and the results are as follows:44 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY.

The number of admissions from this affection was 186 less than in the preceding year, the whole number being two hundred and ninety- three (293), or 45.22 per cent. of the total sickness from all causes.

Incisions were made to evacuate the urine and matter, and there has since been considerable sloughing of cellular tissue of scrotum and penis. The case hitherto has done well under the treatment with plenty of stimulants, and I have now good hopes of recovery. One case of fibrous tumour over the parotid gland was removed and did very well; but there is now a tumour inside the tonsil, and which seems to be connected with the bone. This could not very well be removed, and the treatment has been with caustic lotions and carbolic acid. It has now taken on a slough- ing action, and will, I think, slough away without any dangerous symptoms, as the patient is otherwise in good health. The average daily sick was 30.6, the proportion of sick to strength per cent. 4.5, the pro- portion of admissions to strength per cent. 179.6, and the proportion of deaths to strength per cent. 0.8. One case died while on sick leave, from remittent fever, and another from phthisis pulmonalis. Vaccination has been carried out in the regiment and amongst the followers, as carefully as possible, the total number of vaccinations being 91, of which 79 were successful, and 12 not so. During the year 13 sepoys were invalided, and 41 recruits enlisted. The strength of each caste in regiment has been Europeans 7.5, native Christians 19, Mussulmans 73, Hindoos 575.8, and Jews 2; and the admissions into hospital of each, Euro- peans 5, native Christians 17, Mussulmans Hindoos 1,101, and Jews 1. The lines occupied by the regiment are in very good order, except during the wet season when the roofs of the huts, which are made of flat tiles, leak very much, and the rooms are often very damp and uncomfortable. Government allows a sum of money every season for repairs, but it does not seem to be sufficient for these being done in a proper manner. The drainage is natural, the lines sloping down towards the west. I consider that the latrines are made too near the lines and the regimental bazaar, not being much above 30 yards' distance; and at some seasons the effluvia is complained of, though every means is taken to have them kept as clean as possible. The wells from which the water is taken, are also too near the latrines, and when treated roughly by the permanganate of potass shows signs of organic matter. The drainage of the lines slopes down towards the wells, and thus organic matter may be introduced. The hospital and outbuildings are in good repair, but the quarters for the hospital assist- ants are very second-rate; and new ones are required, as also a latrine for families of the hospital attendants. The hospital establishment is good, and also the conduct and character of the medical subordinates. First Class Hospital Assistant Bhowanee Sing has given me satisfaction in the discharge of his duties. H. M.52 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. The following present the monthly progress of the disease in the shape of admissions:POONA DIVISION OF THE ARMY. 53 As mentioned above, 1,493 cases have been admitted to hospital during the year: of these admissions, 723 have been for fever and ague, 224 for dengue, and 60 for dysentery. There are 151 admissions under the head of rheumatism, of which 56 were accompanied by more or less pyrexia; no case of severe rheumatic fever, however, has been under treatment. The patients mentioned as suffering from chronic rheumatism were, for the greater part, weakly men, among whom 27 were re-admissions. The men have been worked hard during the year, and every man at all subject to any chronic ailment has not only really suffered, but has naturally made the most of his infirmity to escape what to him is overwork. Among these patients who have been under treatment for dysentery or dysenteric diarrh54 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. The water-supply is good in quantity but the quality is suspicious. Prevailing diseases have been intermittent fever and dengue: of the latter no cases are now under treatment. Vaccination has been carefully and successfully carried out in all corps. The accommodation for troops is reported to be sufficient by the various medical officers in charge. The lines of the 8th Regiment are in a bad state, but as new lines in a different locality are to be built, it is not necessary to refer to any details. It has been recommended by the Commanding Officer and Medical Officer of the 1st Regiment Light Cavalry, that new syce lines be built. With reference to conservancy, the Medical Officer 1st Grenadiers reports conservancy system as good; but, at the same time, states that he considers the latrines are placed so near to wells from which the men draw drinking-water, that the purity of water-supply is endangered. 1st Grenadiers, 1st Light Cavalry, 17th Regiment, and Staff Hospital conservancy ar- rangements are good; and 8th Regiment conservancy arrangements good; but the well from which the principal number of the men draw their water-supply is too near the trenches used for deposits.

There was permanent stiffness in one of his fingers, which had been cut in seizing the sword, and he had occasional pain in the loins during micturition. Reduction of Outposts .56 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. Of the different castes and races in the regiment, those whose native climate differed most from that of the place in which they were living, suffered most severely from this affection; the Punjabees and the Purdasees, in proportion to their numbers, contributing a much larger number of admissions than the Mahrattas or Parwarries. The treatment has been much the same as described in former reports, the principal item being ipecacuanha. Large doses seemed most efficacious, when patients could bear larger doses; but, after considerable experi- ence of the use of this drug at Kolhápur, as well as in Dhulia, I have found the large doses, no matter how combined or administered, very apt to produce severe vomiting, and not so efficacious as I formerly found them in Nasirabad, or as I have lately found them in a few cases in Bombay. There were four casualties during the yearPOONA DIVISION OF THE ARMY. 57 2. The new lines are in course of construction, but will probably not be completed until the close of the year. I do not know what are the plans or arrangements for hospital accom- modation, but it should not be overlooked, that provision is necessary in this respect for Europeans and natives, inasmuch as there is always a certain number of the former with the corps, and that there is a probability of this number being raised to one hundred. Separate hospital accommodation for the Europeans will be required, with a male and female ward, as well as a lying-in ward, the necessity of which will be very much felt when the European non-commissioned officers are removed to the new site. 3. The question of water-supply should be considered, but concerning this, there ought to be no difficulty. Water from the Pashan valley is already brought into kirkee, and the expense to cross it over the lines to the new site would not be great; but, whether great or small, I know of no other source available; the river-water should not be used for drinking purpose, and there are no wells on the ground. And if wells were sunk, they would very quickly become polluted, and very probably would fill from a polluted source. 4. The health of the corps, during the year, has been very good, and the mortality in- considerable; the average daily sick has been reduced nearly 2½ per cent., viz., from 10.4 for 1871 to 8.0, and the percentages of treated to strength and of admissions to strength have been reduced from 96.7 and 93.9 for 1871 to 73.9 and 72.7, respectively, for 1872. 5. The mortality of the year, as already observed, has been inconsiderable, and contrasts favourably with the preceding year, the percentage of deaths to strength and to treated being 0.4 and 0.6, respectively, as compared with 1.5 and 1.5 for 1871. 6. The total number of admissions during the year has been reduced by 74 in compa- rison with the previous year, viz., 296 admissions in 1872 against 370 in 1871. 7. Of the whole admissions, the class General Disease forms the greater share, number- ing 202 and giving percentages of 61.4 and 6.7 of the sub-divisions A and B (of which the class consists). 8. Sub-division A is made up of small-pox 2, dengue 12, febricula 53, ague 110, remit- tent fever 2, mumps 2, and erysipelas phlegmonous 1. Total 182 admissions. 9. Sub-division B comprises lumbago 1, chronic rheumatism 11, soft chancre 2, true- leprosy 1, scurvy 4, and general dropsy 1. Total admissions 20. 10. In 1871, these two sub-divisions gave, respectively, 233 and 19 admissions, or per- centages on total admissions of 62.9 and 5.1, which collectively bring up the percentage ad- missions of the class to within a decimal of what the same class gives in the present year, viz., 68.1 for 1872 as compared with 68.0 for 1871. 11. The next class to be noticed is Local Disease, and following the example of my predecessor, I introduce these in the following comparison table:58 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. 15. The last remaining head to be noticed is "Injuries, Local and General," of which there are 32 admissions during the year, as compared with 41 in the previous year; by far the greater number of these were from causes incidental to the work of the sapper, such as blows from working tools, and splinters from wood or stone whilst at work; I do not suppose these will ever be prevented, but shoe-bite adds largely to the number of this class of disease; and is certainly preventible. None of these cases call for further remark excepting-1st, a case of "green stick fracture" occurring in a lad of 14 years of age; in this case the bone bent was the radius of the left arm, and was brought about by gymnastic practice; but as there has since been considerable amount of bony deposit around the seat of injury, it may be questioned whether some partial fracture of the bone did not take place; the 2nd case was fracture of the left femur, at its upper third, occasioned by direct violence; the man was at work carting stones by tramway for the new lines, and while endeavouring to prevent a heavy stone from falling from the truck he was engaged in pushing, he fell and the stone came with consider- -able force on the thigh, fracturing the bone at the junction of the upper with the middle third: this man is still in hospital, but promises to make a fair recovery. 16. Of the two deaths recorded, one occurred shortly after the man's arrival from Aden, where he was said to have suffered much from fever, diarrhPOONA DIVISION OF THE ARMY. 59 HEAD QUARTERS H.

The following tabular statement exhibits the strength, percentage of sickness, and morta- lity during the period under review:POONA DIVISION OF THE ARMY. 63 The rainfall was abundant and seasonable, and has amounted to 44 inches and 51 cents, being 71/2 inches less than the estimated average for Belgaum, which is 52. The table of temperature for the year is omitted, owing to the meteorological records having been sent to Colaba, by the officer in charge of the Observatory attached to the Euro- pean hospital. The cantonment committee (of which the senior medical officer is a member) has met once a month during the year, to consider all matters connected with the sanitary condition of the station; more especially as regards the disposal of sewages and sweepings, the lopping of trees, and keeping down redundant vegetation, together with the working of the Contagious Diseases Act and the Lock-Hospital. During the past year, I believe that Belgaum has maintained its reputation as one of the healthiest stations on this side of India; and the sanitary requirements have been provided for as far as circumstances would admit. There has been a total absence of epidemic disease, and although during the month of September several cases of cholera occurred in the town of Belgaum and close to the limits of the cantonment, no case was brought to notice amongst the native troops. This may be attri- buted, in some measure, to an order having been issued at the instigation of the senior medi- cal officer prohibiting the native soldiery from entering the infected localities. H. M.'S POONA HORSE. SEROOR.64 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. was treated by diaphoretics and morphia at bed time. On the 15th of February, there was considerable hæmorrhage, and as this continued after my arrival, I decided upon opening the wound to its whole extent. Having got the hospital assistant to take charge of the axillary artery, I administered chloroform, then introducing a director into the wound, I divided the deltoid muscle right across. The bleeding vessel, not the same as had been previously liga- tured, was found close to the humerus, underneath and behind the great tuberosity, and must have been a branch of the posterior circumflex. This was ligatured, the wound well sponged out with carbolic acid lotion, and the edges brought into apposition by sutures and plasters. Cold water dressing was applied, for which a light poultice was afterwards substituted to promote granulation. The patient made a rapid recovery, and was discharged from hospital in May. Acute rheumatism gives 10 admissions. All the cases were treated by a succession of small blisters near the affected joints, and internally iodide of potassium and bicarbonate of potash was administered, to which treatment the disease rapidly yielded. The remaining admissions were caused as follows: conjunctivitis 8, diarrhPOONA DIVISION OF THE ARMY. 65 In camp the outbreak was not confined to any particular line of houses or locality, but appeared in several parts of the lines. None of the relations or families of those admitted into hospital were afterwards attacked. Immediately on the appearance of the disease all communication between the lines and village was prevented, and, I believe, it is in a great measure due to the strictness with which Major LaTouche, the Acting Commandant, enforced this order, that so few cases occurred in the lines. From the 1st to the 18th May, 48 cases of diarrh66 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY.

Vaccination has been regularly carried on during the year. On the 28th October the regiment marched on Bombay for duty, during the visit of the Governor General. The whole distance of over 140 miles was accomplished in nine marches without a halt. The duty of the men, while stationed at Parch, was, to say the least of it, very trying; but, nevertheless, the number of sick was comparatively small, and the regiment marched again into Seroor on the 8th December with only one man on the sick list. I may here remark that half the camping ground at Parell was so damp, as to be almost unfit for the men to sleep on. The dispensary, which was lately started at Seroor, has been of great advantage, and it is moderately well attended. The building is substantial and commodious, the only objection being its distance from the village. For the present, this cannot be avoided, as no other house is available. H. M.'s 11TH REGIMENT N.I.

There is a great difficulty in examining bodies, as they should be examined, consequent on the want of a deadhouse; all bodies have to be examined in the verandah of the hospital. Thirty men were sent up before the Invaliding Committee in Poona, of whom 17 were rejected, and have been obliged to be kept in hospital, nearly the whole period that has elapsed since then. On the arrival of the regiment in Poona, 2 havildars were sent before a Special Invalid- ing Committee, one suffering from great debility and the other from a large inguinal hernia on the right side. Two European officers and seven men have proceeded on sick leave during the year, the latter for periods varying from four to twelve months. Vaccination has been steadily practised throughout the regiment, not only among infants but a large number of the men have been re-vaccinated. H. M.'s 13TH REGIMENT N.I.

The total number of sick of the bazar and civil population, presenting themselves for treatment in hospital was 214; this number is smaller than usual this year, as the people in the Pettah bazar and civil population were not allowed entrance to the Fort until August, owing to the existence of cholera and small-pox, the latter of which became epidemic in the bazar (40 cases and 3 deaths) and led to the necessity as stated of isolating the cases outside the Pettah in huts, until finally the epidemic was extinguished and had disappeared. The obvious exposure of the Pettah bazar and civil population to sickness and epidemics (it being on and in direct communication with the main trunk road connecting the Deccan with Hindoostan and Central India), points clearly to the necessity of providing without delay as recommended a dispensary and establishment therein, so as to secure the Garrison and Fort from contracting the prevailing diseases and epidemics of this neighbourhood, unhealthy for many months of the year.

State of hospital buildings as last year continues unsuitable, and its sanitary deficiencies considerable. Originally a pendal, it has no verandahs and but little accommodation, and is utterly insufficient to meet the requirements of the place, which are those of garrison staff and details and general hospital in which the sick of all classes, ages, and sexes, are alike treated. A tent or some adjacent pendals have to be indented for annually to supply the required ac- commodation, not only for the military section of the community, but also for four or fivefold that number of police, native officials, workpeople, &c., employed on Government and other works, who come under constant treatment, and for whom no provision has as yet been made. The present staff hospital has neither cook, bath, ablution, or wash houses of any kind, and the sick in severe cold or trying weather, lasting for four or five months in the year, have not fre- quently to do without their meals or means of ablution, there being no places set apart for such requirements. The latrines are temporary but kept in good order, and Dry-earth system daily carried out. There are no hospital assistants or medical pupils' quarters, and for the time they have to share with the servants the same dark insanitary hovels. It is, I may add, most inconve- nient for such deficiencies to exist so long, though annually represented. Plans and estimates for these and other improvements have been long duly gone into, and sent in by undersigned and the local engineer; but nothing appears to be done, and the want is, therefore, again this year brought forward in this report, in the hope that something may be done through the divisional sanitary authorities, with regard to what has been for the last six or seven years officially recommended by the committees on barrack and other buildings, yearly assembled at this station. The fall of rain, over 41 inches and 48 cents, has been beyond the annual average, which is about 32 inches. The tanks, however, appear not to profit by this abundant fall, as on the water reaching a certain height, they leak. They require inspection during the dry weather when the water is at a low level; and a few broken surfaces where plaster has fallen off should be carefully cemented and set to rights, by which means a considerable saving of water would be effected, which now finds its way through the retaining walls.

Dengue. 9. This disease was prevalent among the European troops treated in the Ghorpuri and Wanowri Barracks, for some months prior to its outbreak in the native lines at Poona. It was not until the monsoon had fairly set in that admissions to hospital became numerous. In the months of July and August no fewer than 520 cases were treated in the hospital of the 1st Grenadiers, and the daily average number of sick, from that cause alone, was 78.4. The total number of cases from all charges was 997, and confined entirely to the troops composing the Poona and Kirkee Brigades. All medical officers who have had an opportunity of treating this troublesome and painful complaint, concur in stating that among natives the rash was observed but in comparatively a few cases. 10. A concise description of the symptoms, progress, and treatment of dengue fever is submitted by the Staff Surgeon in his annual report. This officer seems to be of opinion that heat is necessary to its diffusion, and that the poison is widely disseminated. This may be so among Europeans, but, as before stated, the epidemic hardly attacked the native troops and population until the rains had fallen, and the atmosphere had become cool, pleasant, and only reached its intensity in July and August. The following table will show the number of cases of dengue admitted to hospital and discharged during the year, and how entirely the epidemic was confined to troops in the Poona Brigade:POONA DIVISION OF THE ARMY. 81 Cholera. Cholera in an epidemic form was prevalent in the Poona districts so early as March, but did not reach the city until June. Notwithstanding strict vigilance was exercised by the civil and military authorities, and measures taken to prevent its entrance into camp, a few cases occurred in the lines of the 1st Grenadiers and 8th Regiment, in the months of August and July respectively. There were 4 admissions and 3 deaths. In May the disease broke out in the town of Seroor, and proved fatal to many of its inhabitants. Several cases also took place in the lines of the Poona Horse adjoining the town, but only 3 enlisted men were attacked and recovered. One sowar of the same corps was attacked at Dhulia, with the same result. Altogether 8 cases are recorded with only 2 deaths82 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. 23. It has been strongly recommended to the military authorities that the same measure of good be effected for the syces of the 1st Light Cavalry, for nothing can exceed the squalid wretchedness in which these people live. Last monsoon, cholera struck down a few of them, and considering their filthy habits and the insufficiency of their food and clothing, the wonder is that they were not decimated by that disease. The lines of the sappers and miners at Kirkee are in a rather dilapidated condition, but new lines, near Holkur Bridge and to the eastward of the camp, are in course of construction, and will, in all probability, be finished by the latter end of the year. Allusion has been made by the Medical Officer 1st Light Cavalry to the insanitary condi- tion of the village of Ghorpuri, adjoining the cavalry lines, affecting as it does the health of the troopsPOONA DIVISION OF THE ARMY. 83 ANNUAL RETURN of SICK and WOUNDED of NATIVE REGIMENTS in the Poona Division of the Bombay Presidency from 1st January to 31st December 1872.

The lines are clean, well built, and well kept, but would be improved greatly by having roof ventilation, like those occupied by the 9th Regiment Bombay N. I. in this station. Water. 8. Water is abundant and good, obtained from the river Saburmuttee and wells in the lines. I would suggest that these wells should be thoroughly cleaned out at the end of every hot season. Latrines. 9. The new latrines are in my opinion revolting to every man having the slightest sense of decency. In the regiment they avoid them to my knowledge when they can do so, going beyond cantonment limits when they have occasion for their use, rather than suffer the inevitable exposure. Those of the females are too near those of the males, and the remarks as to those of the males, are equally applicable to those of the females, with regard to their indecency. There are excellent latrines, now disused and closed up by order, that could easily be made available for the Dry-earth con- servancy system, and be convenient in every way. Hospital. 10. The hospital accommodation is excellent as far as it goes. There is great want of a deadhouse, which would serve for both regiments, a female ward, and a separate ward for contagious diseases. The hospital assistants have no privy for their families and no cookroom. Bazar. 11. The camp bazar is good and well supplied with ordinary articles required by the troops; most of the men, however, prefer to get their supplies from the city bazar, where they can obtain them of better quality and cheaper. Native and Europe vegetables are to be obtained, in both bazars, of good quality and at a reasonable price. Fish can also be obtained of good quality. H. M.'S 9TH REGIMENT N.I.

On the north side it runs eastward, then tends south-east towards the Premabhoy gate, then southwards a little past the Kalipur gate, bend- ing inwards, and again it juts out of the gate south of the railway station, running west to the Astorea gate. The streets of the city are well lighted with kerosine lamps. The roads are good, though narrow. The water-supply is ample by wells and a system of cisterns.

It would be well to introduce and encourage the rearing of vegetables at all stations by the sepoys on small allotments of land, conveniently situate near the lines, in the form of soldiers own kitchen gardens. The men by this means would have healthy out-door recreation, and the more important prophylactic usefulness of a fresh vegetable diet ad libitum.

The cantonment is situate on a perfectly (practically level) homogeneous, self-draining sand, containing no known underlying stratum of clay or other im- -pervious medium, and this topographical condition ought to secure it a healthy character; but that it is a malarious station is unquestion- able; and it can only be accounted for by the soil being highly impregnated with organic matter, such as fallen leaves, decayed weed, and jungle, and in the immediate vicinity of the camp, the lines, and every adjacent village, the filth, litter, and excreta which being dessiccated by the intense sun's rays, pulverized by various causes, and wafted to and fro by the changeable winds and electrical conditions of the atmosphere, is deposited over the widespread area, and then subjected to the decomposing effects of the moisture and heat of a tropical monsoon; this the sand absorbs and becomes contaminated, and when the fierce rays of the sun beat upon such a soil after the rains, the mephitic moisture is drawn up to the surface by capillary attraction, and gives off malaria of the most noxious kind. The decomposition of all the roots and fibres, which are always left in the earth, of the dry crops alone, over such an immense tract of country as is cultivated, add materially to the mischief; and the filthy habits of the natives of every gaum, and even those within the canton- ment, are so disgusting as to account for a very considerable portion of the malarious disease extant. These are highly probable, if not certain causes of disease, and they are preventible and removeable causes, and should be attacked rigorously. Village sanitation in vicinity of cantonment. The entire civil native population of all cities, cantonments, and villages, should be legally compelled to have proper domestic latrines, well arranged, and with appointed places at a distance to deposit the filth. Lines' situation. The lines are situated to the north-west of the cantonment: they face south-east, and are in close proximity to the bazar. Their situation is favourable were it not for some closely adjacent nullahs, which are too largely used as latrines by both the troops and the camp followers. Plan. Accommodation. They are built in bocks, two deep and divided by a main street 45 feet wide, and in rows of sixteen, each divided by a cross street 25 feet broad, as in the sketch I append.

NORTHERN DIVISION OF THE ARMY. 91 Latrines. The system of regimental conservancy has been entirely altered during the year. Formerly the standard pattern of permanent latrines was used, but recently the Government of India ordered a system of Trench-latrines to be intro- duced. Long trenches are dug by the sweepers, one foot deep, on a spot of ground indicated, and these are filled in daily, fresh ground being opened up every morning a few feet distant from the last. Canvas screens are placed around the trenches for the sake of decency, and these trenches are gradually extended until sufficient ground has been used, when they are to be ploughed up cross- wise or in a decussate direction, and utilized for cultivation. This system theoretically looks well, but practically it is faulty. The soil here is too sandy, the men do not like it, they avoid using the trenches whenever they can; the women hate it, and consider it an indelicate arrangement, privacy is impossible, the deodorization of the trenches in this sandy soil is in- complete, and the natives decline to cultivate the ground so used; so that every object for which the system has been introduced is frustrated. My own opinion is that the arrangement is ill-adapted to the description of soil that exists here, and that the old system, pending a better one, is the best for Ahmedabad. The Dry-earth system could be carried out in the old regimental latrines, if the native soldier would overcome his prejudices, and the saturated earth could be removed to a distance; or, if that was impracticable, a latrine pan with double cells, well dammered92 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY.

Each private soldier has had 4 nights in bed in the week, the naiques have had 3¾ nights, the drummers 4¾, and the havildars 3½ nights a week. The parades are easy and not of a lengthy duration. I have found that during active work, drill-musketry, &c., the men are in better health and spirits than when they are idle and inactive, and I am of opinion, that a little more route- marching or employment on public works, such as road-making, improving the camp, building butts and entrenchments, would be highly conducive to good health. At present the sepoy has not sufficient work of the proper description to keep him in the active and healthy state so necessary to a soldier. Clothing. The clothing of the native army is faulty. It should combine sufficient protection from beat and cold, with perfect freedom of movement for the body in every position; it should also be durable and solder-like in appearance. At present it embraces none of these advantages. It now consists of a tight fitting, close, scarlet tunic, buttoned at the throat, and tightly round the waist; it is insufficient during the cold weather, and too warm during the hot season; yet, it is worn during both winter and summer. The tightness cramps the marching powers of the men most materially, and is, undoubtedly, a cause of some of the chest affections which carry off a considerable number of the men in the Bombay command every year. The dark-coloured cloth, tight-fitting trousers, are very unsuitable to a sepoy, whose native robes are so free and airy. The Turkish trousers and gaitersNORTHERN DIVISION OF THE ARMY. 93 Food. Castes. Daily food of each caste. Average strength of regiment. Married, single, and children. The food of the native soldier varies considerably according to caste. The Sikhs, Purda- sees, Chutrees, and Brahmins eat no meat, nor fish, nor eggs, nor anything that has within it the germs of animal life. The Maho- medans eat any meat, except that of the swine. The Hindoos, Mah rattas, Madrasees, and Deccanees, can eat fish and any meat, except- that of the sacred cow. All the other castes and creeds eat any meat they can procure. The accompanying Form C gives the daily food of each individual of the various castes, and it appears sufficient in quantity, providing they actually consumed it; but I am inclined to think, on enquiry, that few of them eat so much as is there stated, on account of the custom which pre- vails amongst the natives of sheltering and feeding many relatives; the more of these a man has around him, and sponging on him, the less he can procure for himself. There are numbers of men with so many dependants that they are compelled to underfeed themselves, and they are, consequently, so much less fitted for the duties of a soldier. This praiseworthy effort to support poor relatives by starving themselves, has such an injurious effect on the stamina of the men, that it should be discouraged on all occasions or altogether prohibited. The average strength of the regiment at head-quarters for the year amounted to 472 of all ranks94 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY Treatment. tom visible; in others vomiting and general malaise, but in all cases there was a remarkable uniformity in some of the symptoms of dengue; for instance, the eruption was never wholly absent, nor was the foul, creamy, clammy tongue, with complete loss of taste. Albumen in the urine, more or less, was invariably present, especially on the subsidence of the eruption; and anorexia, frontal headache, and suffused conjunctiva were observed in every case. Every form of treatment was adopted with pretty much the same resultsNORTHERN DIVISION OF THE ARMY. 95 This patient progressed very satisfactorily up to a certain point, about the 15th day after admission and the 24th day from the first symptoms of illness, when the fatal lesion of the bowel occurred, and then he rapidly sank. Treatment. The treatment in this case consisted of a mild calomel and rhubarb aperient, with a little taraxacum given on admission, followed by acetate of ammonia, aconite and chlorate of potass, every three hours, during the gradual increase of the febrile heat.

If, however, the bioplasm of the sensitive papillæ be not included in the graft, skin will be reproduced wanting in sensibility; nor will sudoriparous glands be found in the new skin, unless their peculiar bioplasm be also engrafted. I now invariably cut out and transplant deep thick grafts, including all the structures, and clip out with scissors a corresponding bed in the ulcer, in which I deposit it quickly, and strap down with plain cloth, rendered adhesive all over, except the portion which covers the graft. I do not disturb it until after the 5th day; the margins can be kept clean morning and evening by a piece of wet tow. Utility. Skin-grafting is the easiest and quickest mode of healing old indolent ulcers that I know; but it is necessary to use deep grafts to give vitality and strength with sensibility to the new skin.

NORTHERN DIVISION OF THE ARMY. 107 localities if men have been for a long time exposed to malarious influences, every slight febrile affection, caused by damp, chill, or exposure, has a tendency to assume an intermittent type; and would be very properly classed under the heading of intermittent fever, although, strictly speaking, it is more a revival of a dormant materies morbi than a fresh attack. While on this subject, I may remark that the cases of ague among the men working in the gheer, which has a deadly reputation among the natives of the province, were in every way clear, well-marked types; generally, of the tertian and quartian kinds, and of most per- sistent and intractable character: whereas the men attacked in camp seldom suffered for more than a day or two, the disease being nearly always the quotidian form, and rapidly yielding to mild and ordinary treatment.

The lines are clean and are kept in a good sanitary condition, but the buildings themselves are decidedly bad; they are built on the old standard plan, and the space accorded to each man is much less than the allowance sanctioned by the Government of India, namely, 70 superficial feet for each single man, and 120 super- ficial feet for each family. On one occasion I measured 12 rooms, occupied by single men, and found the average superficial area of each to be about 48 square feet; the average area of the rooms occupied by families approaches nearer to the Government allowance, but in many instances is also very deficient. The huts, too, are very low, being only ten feet high in the centre, and there is no system of ventilation in the roof. The streets between the blocks of huts are wide and exposed to the influence of the wind and the rays of the sun. The lines are unprovided with any system of drainage, and, with the exception of a tree or two here and there, are utterly devoid of shade. Quarter Guard. The quarter guard is a large and suitable building; the solitary cells, two in number, are also good, being 10 feet square and 15 feet in height; they are each provided with a small urinal, and are well ventilated. No additions to the line buildings have been made during the year. State of hospital buildings. These have been kept in a good sanitary state during the year, no additions have been made, but the following great improvement has been effected. In the month of January, when the Major-General Commanding the Northern Division of the Army inspected the regimental hospital, I called his attention to the absence of any system of ventilation in the roof, and recommended that the ridge system should be applied; my suggestion received due attention and the work was performed in the month of April. This has been a very great success, and there is now a very marked difference in the air of the hospital in the early morning, especially in the cold weather, when most of the doors and windows have been closed all night. Two or three times during the year it has been necessary to use the cookhouse of the old artillery hospital for the treatment of cases of small-pox, and on each occasion it has been thoroughly purified and whitewashed directly the patient was discharged. The compound of the hospital was carefully cleared of all redundant vegetation after the rains. The hospital accommodation proved inadequate during October and November, when the daily average number of sick was 115 and 163 respectively; and many men who were still unfit for duty were consequently permitted to live in the lines. As I have on a former occasion fully described the hospital, it is not necessary to do so again, but I may mention that in the event of a recurrence of such a sickly season, I can, by making use of every available space, accommodate about 70 patients; this, of course, includes the old artillery hospital, and also fifteen beds placed in the verandah of the regimental hospital. In the month of December, consequent on the receipt of an order to that effect from the Major-General Commanding the Northern Division, the Dry-earth system of conservancy was adopted in the hospital latrine, as it had only been in use for a week at the end of the year: any special remarks upon the system are unnecessary. The following table shows the increase and decrease in the regiment during the year:110 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. One havildar suffered from partial contraction of the left elbow joint, the result of a severe contusion (without fracture) sustained in a fall when off duty. Two privates were affected with leprosy, one of the " tubercular " and the other of the anæsthetic " variety, they were neither of them incapacitated for duty, but they were both anxious to take their pension, as their position in the regiment was a very unpleasant one: their comrades of the same caste refusing to eat with or associate with them in any way. One private had been seized with mania, which showed itself in his suddenly making a furious and unprovoked attack on the hospital orderly, whom he found sleeping outside his house, and who was under treatment for scalp wound and contusion of the face for two months afterwards. One man had been under treatment for a long time for fissures in the skin of the feet, which refused to heal under a multiplicity of different applications, and when at last they did heal, other fissures appeared about the hands and fingers; and bullæ formed on the hands and forearms, which left unhealthy ulcers behind them. One man had a tendency to hæmorrhoids, or rather a chronic congestion of the mucous membrance of the rectum, which was relieved by periodical discharges of blood. Three men also were invalided on medical grounds during the year, whose length of service did not entitle them to pension: one for general debility and mental incapacity, one for dementia, and one for hernia. The latter case was a young sepoy in whom the rupture occurred for the first time while on a parade, although in other respects a strong, healthy man; his infirmity of course ren- dered him unfit for the active duties of a soldier; I, therefore, represented the matter to the Commanding Officer and recommended that he should be discharged the service; my recom- mendation received the approval and sanction of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief.

Small-pox Rheumatism112 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. State of the regiment. The regiment enjoyed excellent health during the first eight months of the year; ague furnished only 37 admissions during that period, the daily average number of sick being only 25; but I regret to say that, during the last four months of the year, ague prevailed to an extent unprecedented in the memory of any officer or man in the regiment; no fewer than 522 cases of the disease were admitted during that period; and the fever, although not fatal, was of a very prostrating type, and left the men exceedingly feeble and shattered in health for along afterwards. In the month of October alone the total admissions were 223, of which 197 were due to ague, and the daily average number of sick, was 115.3; but these numbers alone give no idea of the state of inefficiency to which the regiment was temporarily reduced, as a number of men who were not sick themselves were granted leave for the purpose of attending their wives and children, many of whom were also fever-stricken; and even those men who had been dis- charged from hospital were so weak that parades were altogether out of the question. In the month of November the admissions from ague were fewer, being 140 only, but the daily average number of sick was much higher, being 163.7; this was owing to the reduced state of the men, most of whom had been in hospital twice, and some of them four times, during the previous 3 months; and their convalescence was so slow and tedious, that I was obliged to keep them a long time in hospital after the fever had ceased to recur. In December the health of the regiment began to improve, the sick list on the 1st of the month being 159, and on the 31st only 48: the number of ague cases admitted during the month were 59, of which 34 occurred during the first half of the month. During the early part of the month of October when my supply of quinine was limited, I treated many of the cases with arsenic, bebeerine, solution of quinoidine, and such other drugs possessed of antiperiodic virtue as I happened to have in store; and when these were all expended (except a very small supply of quinine which I kept in reserve for special cases), I was obliged to fall back upon kreat and decoction of nimbark, (made every morning accord- ing to the directions in the Indian PharmacopeiaNORTHERN DIVISION OF THE ARMY. 113 Many of the cases of ague had enlargement of the spleen, which kept them for some- time on the convalescent list, and some of them had still enlarged spleens when they returned to their duty. Dengue. Another notable feature in the health of the regiment during the year was the occurrence, during the month of September, of 11 cases of dengue. During the month of August and the first part of September, hearing that the disease had appeared in the province (said to have been imported into Mandavi from Jam- nagar), I was very careful in watching the cases of ague admitted in order to detect it at once if it should occur; but it was not until the 13th of the latter month that anything like it appeared, although a great number of cases were reported to have occurred in the city and in the country round. On the 13th and 14th eleven men were admitted with pyrexia, frontal headache, pain and stiffness in the limbs, &c., but no swelling of the joints. I found that the fever was a continued one, and that the cases presented the features of dengue, as described in recent literature on the subject. Nine of them recovered and were discharged by the end of the month, and the other two remained under treatment for sometime for stiffness of the knee-joint: there was only one case in which I could detect anything like an eruption, and in that a scarlet efflorescence appeared on the palms of the hands, succeeded by desquamation of the cuticle, which latter was also observed on the back of the neck, ears, and breast. I treated them with saline mixture and opium: in 3 cases I employed tincture of belladonna in 10 minim doses, four times a day, as recommended by Dr. Charles of Calcutta; they afterwards had tonics, &c. On the 15th of the month, a violent thunderstorm passed over camp, from the north, and after that date no case in the least resembling dengue presented itself at the regimental hospital, although it was said to prevail in the city all through the month of October. I am, however, rather sceptical on this point, and I am inclined to think that many of the cases pronounced to be dengue, would, under constant and effective supervision, have been registered as ague. Small-pox. Three cases of small-pox occurred in the regiment during the year: one in February114 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. my notice115 NORTHERN DIVISION OF THE ARMY. Health of civil population. the purpose, in the bed of the Bunass. Thus, something has been effected to ameliorate the con- dition of the inhabitants; but, although the conservancy has been improved, yet, contrasted with last year, the health of the civil population has been very bad. From January till May, an epidemic of discrete small-pox prevailed, but the ratio of deaths was very small. By the end of June the pandemic wave of dengue reached Deesa, and upwards of 95 per centum of all inhabitants were sufferers. No deaths re- sulted. When dengue had all but disappeared, in September and October a low adynamic fever of the remittent type, raged for many days; upwards of 10 deaths per diem were reported. Total deaths amounted to 393, and, estimating the population at 9,000, this shows a deathrate of 43.6 per thousand. Males suffered much more from bowel complaint than females. There were 21 deaths of the former and 9 of the latter. One old man died from the effects of snake- bite. I subjoin a statement showing the mortality in the bazars during the year:116 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY.

As regards the geology, topography, and natural productions of Deesa and surrounding country, reference may be made to my annual report for 1871. Supplies. 15. The season of 1872 has been favourable. and the supply of grass and cereals ample; but there was considerable difficulty in procuring cattle and sheep during the latter part of the hot season and rains. The commissariat gardens supply large quantities of lucerne grass. Charsilia and guinea grass are also culti- vated, and afford excellent food for cattle during the hot season, when all vegetation disappears from the ground. Medical Topography. 16. The following are the principal endemic diseases prevalent among the natives of the country around Deesa, enumerated in the order of their frequency, viz., ague, small-pox, conjunctivitis, purulent opthalmia, rheumatism, bowel complaints, venereal disease, guinea-worm, strumous affections; cataract, fungus foot, calculus vesicæ, and cancer in various forms. 17. During March and April I amputated a number of legs for fungus disease of foot, by long anterior and short posterior flaps, and they all terminated successfully under Lister's carbolic-acid treatment. 18.Two hard senile cataracts were extracted by me by the scoop-method, making the incision at the junction of the sclerotic and cornea: the spoon used was Critchett's. One case was successful. A boy's upper arm, which had been crushed by the wheel of a heavily-laden cart passing over it, was amputated at the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the humerus. The parts healed kindly, and he was discharged from the hospital in excellent health twenty-one days after the operation. Sickness in regiment: 19. During January the average strength of the regiment at Deesa was 58, the first sauad- ron being at Rajkot, and the 2nd and 3rd squadrons at Bhuj, whither they marched to be present at state ceremonies. Their encamping- ground there was badly situated118 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. its anodyne and hypnotic action being in a great measure dependent the one upon the other. Where the functions of the brain are intact, and the dose is a medicinal one, the hypnotic action of chloral is rarely so profound as to destroy all feeling, or means of communication from without." Thus intense pain will suspend the action of a safe dose of chloral. Free incisions (five in all) were made on the thumb; and the pus under the microscope showed branched bodies like the mycelium of mucor subtillissimus. Great swelling of the lymphatics, and eruption of pustules on the forehead and of boils on the back and thighs, showed the blood to have been poisoned. The disease yielded to the free incisions, not fomentations, and to the internal administrations of tincture ferri and chlorate of potass after twenty-seven days' suffering. 27. During May and June the total admissions into hospital were 33, showing a con- siderable diminution compared with the previous months. 28. During five days in June there were no patients in or out of hospital. A few of the sowars who recently arrived from Rajkot suffered from a very tenacious form of remittent fever. Liquor arsenicalis was administered in five minim doses, three times daily, always after meals, gradually diminishing the dose, with benefit. 29. Dengue. 119 NORTHERN DIVISION OF THE ARMY. 36. The pyrexia ceased entirely by the end of the fourth day, but on the fifth there was slight elevation of temperature coincident with the terminal rash. 37. Treatment: diaphoreties, diuretics: belladonna ten minims every hour for the first four hours; this did not alleviate the pain, but seemed to lessen the irritability and sooth the rest- lessness. Chlorate, carbonate and nitrate of potass, and iodide of potassium where freely given. 38. By the beginning of September dengue had nearly disappeared120 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. Table. 2nd Light Cavalry. Strength 301.

The latrine accommodation of the hospital is insufficient for the increased number of beds; but a letter has been sent to the Brigadier about it, and it will doubtless be remedied. Owing to the great weakness of the regiment all Brigade parades have been stopped, and both European and natives have been relieved of this extra duty.

The system of Trench-latrines was ordered to be introduced at this station, and the experi- ment was commenced on ground 26 1/2, 88, and 136 yards, respectively, from the wells; but on my indicating the risk of contamination to the water-supply, they were moved to a greater distance. In consequence of the representation made on the subject, a committee was assembled, and reported that the available ground for Trench-latrines consisted of black soil to a depth of about 12 feet from the rock but in parts less, that it becomes broken up into holes and fissures in the dry season, that water-courses were running in close proximity to the wells, and that when heavy rain occurred the ground might be more or less flooded, and the water, it was ap- prehended, might be apt to contaminate the wells. They ventured to suggest that in the Bengal Presidency, where the Trench-latrine system originated, the native troops are not in the habit of keeping their families with them, that on the Bombay side a native corps has usually about 300 women and about the same number of children, and that danger to health would be likely to arise, were the native troops compelled to use open trenches, at stations like this, in heavy rains, where the black soil quickly becomes mud; and that it would be almost impossible to prevent the verandahs and even rooms of houses from being used by women and children for the purposes of nature rather than be exposed to the inclemency of the weather. Not only the native troops, but the more respectable class of native inhabitants, dislike the use of trenches, on account of the exposure and inconvenience to their wives and families. The men had become accustomed to the use of the permanent latrines, from which the filth was removed beyond cantonments, and the system was unattended with risk to health or to drinking-water. The committee considered that the saturation of the ground in the vicinity of the lines, with the excrementitious matter of upwards of two thousand indivi- duals, would be apt to induce "a filth-sodden soil" which would predispose to disease of a low type, and produce a deteriorating effect on the health of the troops, though such influence might no doubt be lessened by deep ploughing and subsequent systematic cultivation; but to carry out this would be attended with considerable expense from want of water. The matter was referred to Executive Engineer, who admitted the existence of risk in one well to be slight, in that it might be affected through the neighbouring nullah, in one on lower ground that there might be risk of pollution, and in one, which was used by the lower castes, still more likely to be the case. On the whole, the risk of contamination was small, though per- haps sufficient to deter in carrying out a scheme which, whatever its merits and however well it may have worked elsewhere, is not universally popular, as at Belgaum, Rajkot, and Kurra- chee, and is impracticable during the rains, if the monsoon is severe. The Sanitary Commis- sioner on being consulted stated that the ground used need not be large, and might be trenched over and over again, that deodorization is immediate and complete, that if moisture be carefully excluded, disintegration is so absolute, that after a time the f125 NORTHERN DIVISION OF THE ARMY. In the past year the average strength was 494, the admissions into hospital were 885, the deaths 3, and the number sent on sick leave 7. The daily average sick was 23 or 4.61 per cent., the proportion of admissions to strength was 178.34, and of deaths to strength 0.6. In the year 27 men were pensioned, whose average service was 20 years, 2 months, and 11 days, and two men of short service were discharged from the service for atrophy and general debility. Fever has composed the greater portion of the admissions, and was most prevalent in the past monsoon season, when the disease was of a malarious character, and was obstinate for a time, particularly in men whose constitutions had previously been affected by the disease. In some instances that had been treated elsewhere, hypodermic injection had been used with ouly temporary benefit, and had left large, indelible, ulcer marks on the arm. In the hot season the disease was apparently connected with climatic causes, and from exposure while repairing the lines, which was, however, reduced as far as practicable; also, probably, to a certain extent from picket duty that was required to carry out the quarantine arrangements up to the 22nd June. In the rains and cold season the usual thoracic complications were met with, and in the hot season neuralgic headaches were not unfrequently complained of. There was no case of typhoid fever in the course of the year. Disease connected with innutrition has been pre- sent as usual, but has been most marked amongst the families. Were the condition and development of children taken as a criterion for judging of the health of native troops, the estimate formed would be an unfavourable one; for the majority of the children that are born in the lines are physically unfit for the ranks, and, indeed, a large portion are even unsuited for entertainment as recruit boys from weakly conformation and defective stamina. The other most important events in the medical history of the regiment, have been the occurrence of small-pox and the exemption from cholera, which prevailed in the camp and neighbouring districts in the the hot season. Small-pox was introduced by a recruit, and was contracted by him in all likelihood in some village on the line of march; and in his case the disease prov- ed to be of a severe character, though he had been vaccinated in former years, but not since joining the corps. The disease, however, did not extend beyond five cases in all, being con- fined to two men, one woman, and two children. During the year an inspection has been made of every individual that came into the lines, even for a few days, and with good result. In accordance with instructions from the Inspector General, re-vaccination was commenced on 5th November 1872, but was not carried beyond 88 cases from failure of the supply of lymph, and of these 5 proved successful, 2 of which had small-pox previously, 1 had been protected by small-pox and vaccination, and 2 had vaccine marks on their arms. The number is too few to be relied on for generalization, but taken in connection with the results mentioned in the Madras Monthly Journal of Medical Science, it would evidently indicate that all recruits should be vaccinated on joining, and that none should be exempted from the operation on account of their having had small-pox previously or been vaccinated in their native country. Diseases of the General System and affections of the Respiratory System were not nume- rous. Of the latter there were 15 from bronchitis, of which several were more or less phthisi- cal in character; and 5 had to be invalided on this account126 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. the same date disease showed itself in the 49th Regiment, in which corps there were 12 cases- In the sudder bazar the disease appeared on the 21st April, and from that date to the 16th June there were 33 cases. The native troops in garrison remained comparatively free, and only one man of the 16th N.I. was attacked who had just returned from furlough, and had been allowed to enter camp before quarantine arrangements had been fully carried out; but those moving about in the districts were liable to diarrhNORTHERN DIVISION OF THE ARMY. 127 Kissonpore Station E.

The quality of the water that was used by the party of recruits, who had come from an infected district and were predisposed by fatigue of the march, may have been one of the factors and may have contributed to the development of the disease; but, otherwise, as far as could be judged, the affection was imported from the infected districts, and the establishment of quarantine tended to limit the disease.

The means adopted have been already mentioned in the monthly report. They were emptying the hospital as much as possible by pitching tents for the reception of the cases of ulcer, and the free use of disinfectants. The patients suffering from sloughing ulcer were allowed full rations of meat arrack, &c. Three cases have recovered. The fourth remains under treatment, and does not, I regret to say, make any favourable progress. The other cases having been reported in the monthly returns do not call for a repetition of the remarks, State of lines and sub- sidiary buildings. The regimental lines are built of sun-dried bricks and are tiled. There is no overcrowd- ing. Owing to the materials of which they are constructed, the walls occasionally fall in the wet weather. Huts are easily repaired. Sanitary condition and conservancy. This I consider to be good. The conservancy arrangements are adapted to both the rainy and dry seasons. In the rains the Dry-earth conservancy is carried on in latrine buildings, of which there are two for men and one for women. In the dry season the Trench system is in vogue. Both latrines are to the north of the lines and generally to leeward of them. State of hospital and buildings. The hospital is a pucka built building, with ventilators in the roof, which is arched and covered with chunam on the outside. The accommodation is insufficient. The floor is of chunam which is a great drawback, as it cannot be either "leeped" or cow-dunged, much dust is the consequence. It is also expensive and very tedious to repair. There is no ward for either ophthalmic or contagious diseases, no guard-room and the accommodation for the subordinate medical department is insufficient. A deadhouse is also required. These deficiencies have been annually pointed out for some years past, and I believe that steps will be taken to remedy the principal deficiences. The latrine is in rear of the hospital and carried on with the Dry-earth system. Water-supply. Water-supply is good and sufficient from three wells; the quality of the water is unknown to me.

Lung Diseases.NORTHERN DIVISION OF THE ARMY. 131 During the year there has been prevalent among the men of the 22nd no sickness caus- ing much inefficiency, excepting malarious fever, which yielded 841 out of 1,163 admissions to hospital. These figures are probably not strictly correct; as there is no doubt that when a man presents himself with an ailment, not thoroughly developed or readily diagnosed, the difficulty is met by entering the case under the head of Fever: yet the fact stands good, that malarious fever has been and is the bane of the station. In attempting to form some notion of the possible cause of so great a prevalence of fever from year to year among the men occupying the native infantry lines at Neemuch, I have framed the following tables:132 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. After the lapse of a fortnight the lines were re-occupied, and no further instance of the disease occurred among the residents in them. No other disease noted in the return seems worthy of special remark. The invalids of the season numbered 21. Six women and seventeen children have died in the lines of the regiment during the year. These are taken account of in the mortuary returns pertaining to the general popula- tion of the cantonment. One of the women died from cholera; it was the first instance of the disease as pertaining to the regiment. No extraordinary scarcity or dearness of alimentary supplies for the men and their fami- lies has occurred; but fruit and vegetables have not been obtainable in abundance, and in the hot season were scarcely procurable. The water of the wells in use seems to be good, and the supply is reported to have been sufficient. The conservancy of the lines has been excellently maintained (surface drainage duly attended to); and the latrines133 NORTHERN DIVISION OF THE ARMY. Seven men were sent on sick leave.

The Trench system of latrines has been in operation in the squadron and infantry dur- ing the year, the only drawback is the distance the women and children have to go, owing to the situation of the only ground available for the purpose. The health of the staff and details has been satisfactory during the year. One death took place during the year from diarrh135 NORTHERN DIVISION OF THE ARMY. H. M.'S 4TH REGIMENT N.I.

Subjoined is a table of these extremes given by self-regis- tering thermometer:137 NORTHERN DIVISION OF THE ARMY. 248 additional cases had been received which, with 4 in July, made a total of 514 under treat- ment. On June the 5th, when there were 119 on the list, the epidemic culminated, and from the day in question continued to decrease until the 30th idem, on which date only two patients remained, and the disease may be said to have virtually died out, for thereafter the cases were few and far between. Dengue was no exception to the singular law of exclusion which obtains in epidemics generally, in virtue of which all other diseases are either in abey- ance or comparatively rare. Ague, which from January to May had been the prevailing malady, only furnished four admissions in the latter month; so that on their discharge, June, as regards intermittent fever, opened with a clean bill of health. Before its close and after the epidemic had begun to abate, twenty patients had been admitted. In July 16 were under treatment, which is one in excess of the average number (15) of ague cases met with from January to July, May excepted. Including May, 16 is by a curious coincidence the average for the first seven months of the year. The average strength of the regiment during the pre- valence of dengue was 627, and the number attacked as already stated was 514, the percentage for admissions to strength was 82.2 The disease generally began abruptly, although in many cases premonitory symptoms occur- red, such as loss of appetite, obscure and wandering pains, tingling of the extremities, lumbar dis- tress, general langour, and malaise. The rule, however, in the majority was that of a sudden invasion. During the febrile stage, with an average duration of 30 hours, the symptoms were well marked, the pulse was accelerated, great thirst and excessive headache occurred, with excruciating pains in the muscles and joints, which completely crippled the patient. As the fever abated the severity of the pains diminished. In many cases a scarlatina-like eruption was developed on the face, neck, chest, arms, and palms of hands. This symptom was invariably present in all the Europeans who were attacked. A scorbutic taint occurred in most of the sepoys affected. Relapses were occasionally met with. The convalescence of natives was in marked contrast to that of Europeans; which in my own case and experience was tedious and pro- tracted. Dengue, however, is not a fatal disease. In hospital upwards of 500 cases were treat- ed and there were no casualties. The affection, in the words of Dr. Flint, although extremely distressing and presenting not unfrequently severe symptoms, is rarely if ever fatal. Its appa- rent intensity is in striking contrast to its absence of danger. Whilst the epidemic was rag- ing among the sepoys themselves, their families in the lines, as already stated, were not passed over by the prevailing malady. It is the opinion of many that the disease is contagious; I do not think it is; for its speedy and almost simultaneous spread would appear to render the theory of contagion untenable. From all I can gather the disease when epidemic seldom lasts more than 7 or 8 weeks. The fons et origo mali, it were hard to determine. The malady was known in Baroda 44 years ago: this fact was stated to me by old men who suffered from the disease at that time. In those days there appears to have been less fever, but greater severity of pains in the limbs and joints with spastic contractions. Recovery was perfect in 3 or 4 days, differing from the present epidemic which frequently left the patient crippled for weeks and a martyr to boils and buboes. Children in a large majority of cases had convulsions. In treating the disease salines with colchicum were freely administered. Quinine and iodide of potassium appeared to do much good. Hot fomentations, stimulating and occasion- ally anodyne liniments generally relieved the pains. Chloral was exhibited to induce sleep with good effect in all cases. When the disease was dying out in the Rifles, it next appeared among the men of the Royal Artillery and attacked 13 out of 24, the strength of the detachment. Last of all the employés of the B. B. and C. I. Railway Company were affected. By this time the atmospheric condition with which at first the disease in its severest form was ushered in, was changing, for the severity of these last attacked was mild compared with those which were met when the epidemic commenced. The following tables have been prepared to show the prevalence of dengue in the various sections of the community in camp:138 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY.

Change of air, it was believed, would do more good than other measures in Baroda, or treatment of any kind. Contusion.141 NORTHERN DIVISION OF THE ARMY. The portion of the lines now used as a hospital is hardly sufficient for the purpose, the ventilation is bad and cannot well be improved, as the rooms on the other side of the walls are occupied by the men of the detachment, and it is not, therefore, possible to obtain a current of air through the rooms.

On the 3rd of February the right half battalion was detached to Augur. The sickness and mortality in the 25th Regiment at Mehidpoor during the year were both considerable, and the number of admissions into hospital, particularly from ague, very high. The average strength at head-quarters amounted to 311; the total number of admissions into hospital 913; the daily average of sick 23.075; the percentage of admissions to strength 292.60; the percentage of treated to strength 300, of deaths to treated 0.64, and of deaths to strength 1.93. The high rate of mortality was caused by a slight outbreak of cholera in the canton- ment during the month of May, June, and July. Ague has been the prevailing disease during the year, and contributed 516 to the total number of admissions into hospital. The disease occurred chiefly in the rains, and the number of admissions from it increased monthly from thirty-four in July to thirty-five in August, seventy-four in September and to one hundred and twenty-one in October. In the month of November there was a great decrease in the number of ague cases, and only twenty-six men were admitted into hospital for that disease. In August the ague cases were almost all com- plicated with diarrh144 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. The remaining diseases of the digestive system of any importance, two were of gastritis, four of dyspepsia, five of hæmorrhoids, three of inflammation, and one of abscess of the liver, and four from splenitis. One of the sufferers from gastritis has been pensioned, and the case of abcess of the liver proved fatal. The three cases of hepatitis treated successfully with chloride of ammonia. There was neither diarrhNORTHERN DIVISION OF THE ARMY. 145 Dry-earth is used in the hospital latrines; but the urine and water used by the men was carried to rear of the building in chunam gutters, and there allowed to evaporate or sink into the ground until the past year. On the matter being reported, as prejudicial to the health of the cantonment, iron pans were fitted in the rear for the reception of all fluids which flow from the building, and it is now in good order. The Rainfall and Temperature .146 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. The climate is noted for its general coolness and salubrity. The rainfall is somewhat greater than in other stations of Central India. This is probably due to the proximity of the Vendayha range of mountains, and the abundance of trees in the vicinity. The geological formation of the district consists of trap composed of clinkstones, granular and columnar trap147 NORTHERN DIVISION OF THE ARMY. REPORT BY THE DEPUTY INSPECTOR GENERAL OF HOSPITALS, NORTHERN AND MHOW DIVISIONS, 1872. A review on the sanitary state of our Indian native troops, is a thing apart from that of the European element with which I have served in this land; climate exercises its modified influence on each constitution148 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. 10. Since writing the above I have observed certain remarks on this subject from the Medical Officer at Mehidpoor, Dr. Heffernan. 11. On such cases, I do believe, many valuable medicines are expended without a corres- ponding valuable result; nor does it appear to me that the less expensive hypodermic treat- ment, so safe and yet so effective where rheumatic or neuralgic affections do really exist, is sufficiently or so frequently resorted to as might be, since the blebs and ulceration following such operations are not caused by the fluid " prophylactic," but chiefly from irritation arising from forced puncture with blunt instruments or clumsiness. 12. I have never observed bad results, nor do I use these delicate instruments as issued from the Government Stores, preferring my own private ones, which enter as readily as a lancet manufactured by a first class artizan. 13. I have seen very good results in these cases by the injection both of morphia and atrophine, though I prefer the latter in neuralgia. Diseases of the respira- tory organs. 14. Bronchitis and asthma are the more prominent of these among natives, and, although some cases are to a certain extent feigned, the stethoscope is the great detector in " stage coughs." Syphilis. 15. This disease, in former years productive of great loss in all arms of the service, is at a minimum now, thanks to the establishment of lock hospitals and improved official scrutiny; consequently, I shall not dwell on the re- cords from medical officers in change of regiments149 NORTHERN DIVISION OF THE ARMY. 16th Regiment N. I., who, by the way, has been led into error in reporting in his annual, five deaths, whilst one only of his regiment died in hospital, the remaining four being on their way to join another regiment, were treated at the cholera hospital beyond the cordon; yet, the disease did not amount to an epidemic in any station, and admissions by comparison to populations150 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. 34. The trial of asphalte for flooring the civil hospital at Aden has been sanctioned by Government, and doubtless a favourable result will accrue; if so, the material should be introduced generally into all hospitals151 NORTHERN DIVISION OF THE ARMY. 51. Half measures are useless; the work must be done by one independent medical offi- cer with magisterial powers, where large cities and cantonments exist in vicinity; neverthe- less, what has been has been done well, and the disease has, to a considerable amount, decreased amongst all arms of the service. 52. I would suggest a committee on the Mhow Lock Hospital, and if approved of this should form the design for all buildings in the future. It is on the serraie plan. 53. I would suggest for consideration a general or civil hospital for Mhow, unless the General or civil hospi- Government accept the liberal offer made by Mr. Pestonjee Dorabjee, tal for Mhow. the philantrophic founder of the Dorabjee Dispensary at that station.

There are two tanks in vicinity with cantonment: one reported noisome in the hot season, nevertheless the station is classed as very healthy, and the tank remains unmolested, so much for "malaria ." 74. A wing only of a native regiment is located here from the Bombay service, and its sick are treated in tents pending the completion of a new hospital, the site of which is very good, being on the most rising ground in cantonment, yet a little too far from the lines I think. 75.

Invaliding .SIND DISTRICT OF THE ARMY. 159 progress of the fever, considering the quick and steady manner in which it was spreading amongst the other classes of the native community, where these rules were not observed; but I soon found, to my great disappointment, that the admissions from dengue began to increase with astonishing rapidity, until a large number of men in the regiment had fallen victims to it. I believe that the disease must have been imported from Kurrachee, most probably pro- pagated by means of the natives passing to and fro' between these two stations; this is, however, of little import, as of course such intercourse is unavoidable, and there are other sources of contagion with regard to dengue than those of mere personal infection, the fountain- head of which might be profitably sought after, so as to enable us to grapple with the disease, should it again present itself. Is there any reason, for instance, to suppose that dengue may not help to spread itself through the medium of water, as we know that cholera does? If so, isolation of the patients alone can be of little avail so long as the water is open to pollution. With regard to this, it is worthy of remark, that while dengue prevailed as it did in this regi- ment, the detachment 66th Regiment, consisting of 3 companies, and a battery of royal artil- lery, stationed here, were almost free from it, when it was raging everywhere else; this will be seen by the following statement:160 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. as a rule though fever only makes its appearance once. Prostration of strength is not the only thing that the patient suffers from at this stage of the disease: the pains in the joints now become more severe than hitherto, occasionally, though being all but absent at this time. Usually there is much stiffness accompanying the rheumatism, which is especially felt in the early morning upon awaking, the pains being so capricious that they then attack parts without any apparent cause, and gradually disappear as the day wears on; and this may go on for weeks or sometimes months: there were patients of mine who, having been attacked with dengue almost three months ago, still complained of pains in their joints at times. This protracted effect of dengue is no doubt due, in a great measure, to the severity of the weather, which is very cold here at this season of the year. In connection with dengue, it is remarkable that it seldom occurs amongst Europeans without bringing in its train some other affection, which often proves more severe than dengue itself: such for example as sorethroat, ague, dysentery, debility, dyspepsia, &c., and of course these are attended by the rheumatic pains so peculiar to the disease. Dengue, no doubt, induces a peculiar state of the system which lays it open to these complications, an effect intensified by the cold weather and the malarious season. Regarding the treatment of dengue I find that, unless proper precautions be taken to prevent the patient from catching cold during the fever, especially if the eruption happen to be on at the time, agonizing pains, which before appeared to be comparatively mild, seize the patient. These often prove to be obstinate. Some of the patients are difficult to manage; in the irritability of the fever they throw off their bed cloths, and lay themselves open to the unfavourable result just mentioned. In the first blush of the disease, if the stomach happened to be foul, and this was very often the case, an emetic was given, followed by purgatives and diaphoretics, the latter always afforded much relief to the patients, especially in cases where fever was high. Quinine with iodide of potassium was also given with advantage; after the fever had passed away, tonics and iron proved useful, and when the pains become chronic, exercise and electricity seemed to do more good than almost anything else; friction, with anodyne liniments, was always carried out, but it only gave temporary relief. The prognosis of dengue is extremely favourable: no deaths have taken place in the Belooch regiment, neither have any occurred, to my knowledge, in Haidarabad. The subse- quent effects ordinarily produced by an attack of dengue have just been mentioned as far as my experience goes. Before closing these remarks upon dengue, I should like to add the following table show- ing the number of cases which were admitted into hospital from the Belooch regiment, while the disease prevailed:161 SIND DISTRICT OF THE ARMY. nullah, is inadequate to the quantity required, as was experienced last year, just before the annual rise of the Indus. The water at this time was so low and muddy that it was quite undrinkable without the aid of filters; in fact, had the overflow of the river been later than it was, we should have had no water; as it was there was a scarcity. Happily, the main source of the water-supply in these three wells is not confined to the nullah, the adjoining ground and plains contribute the largest share; being covered for a considerable time by the inundation, they store up the water, which continually percolates through the soil and gravel into the wells. This was demonstrated practically on one occasion when the wells were being cleaned out; a stone near the bottom of one of these fell out, and the water dashed in from the direction opposite to the nullah before alluded to, causing the speedy exit of the persons inside. A point with reference to these wells that I should wish to bring forward, is their liability to pollution by the natives, as they are unprovided with any appliances for raising water162 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. there was nothing in its favour: The following were my views upon the matter, as expressed in a letter at the time:SIND DISTRICT OF THE ARMY. 163 have already had small-pox, to come forward for the purpose of being again vaccinated, but they seem to have an almost insurmountable objection to this; however, I will do what lies in my power to further the experiments which are tried now in so many parts of the presi- dency. Although my experience is very slight upon the subject of these experiments, I think it will be very difficult, in many cases, to come to a correct conclusion as to the success or otherwise of the operation in adults, particularly in the case of men, on account of the thick- ness of the skin, as the vesicles are never so well developed in adults as they are in children. Diet of Sepoys. 164 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. There are also two Government gardens, which form a pleasant resort in the evenings. The station itself is situated on an eminence some twenty feet above the level of the surrounding country: the camp consists of two rows of mud-built bungalows, one-storied and fiat-roofed, roughly built, but, with their grey color, harmonizing not badly with the green surroundings of the station. The points of interest in Haidarabad are the tombs and the Fort; the tombs are those of the Ameers of Sind for many generations back; some of these are kept in very good order and are well worth seeing; several portions of the interior being, in some instances, of carved marble, and the tomb of the chief rajah contains relics of its last occupant. The Fort, which stands just as it did when the English marched in to take possession after the Battle of Meanee, is, in shape; somewhat irregularly oblong, and has a tower some fifty feet high, the prospect from which is very varied, giving bird's-eye view of the whole surround- ing country; this tower and some of the bastions of the Fort are mounted with cannon. The Fort is, so to speak, in the very midst of the canals and nullalis, and is, consequently, much more unhealthy for its inhabitants as an abode than camp, on account of the exhalations arising from these impure sources; the Europeans living there suffer continually from fever, but this of course is unavoidable as long as the sanitary condition of its neighbourhood re- mains as it now does. The Fort covers an area of thirty-seven acres; it contains the chief arsenal in Sind, and also several small bungalows for the use of the employés in the Ordnance Department, in addition to the store lascars' lines, which are now in process of being built. The native town consists of an oblong mass of mud-built houses, interspersed with occasional daubs of whitewash; its population is of 32,162; it appears to be cleanly and well looked after for a native town: with respect to the camp it is situated to the north-east and is built on a plain still higher than the camp, which, consequently, receives the overflow from the city during the rainy season, bringing with it, most probably, quantities of decayed animal and vegetable matter, some of which pass into the nullahs which are close to the wells, from which the drinking water is taken for the use of the Belooch regiment and of the European officers of the station. Drainage .SIND DISTRICT OF THE ARMY. 165 The unusual amount of sickness in Haidarabad this year, is most probably attributable in part to this excess of rainfall (which was much above the average), causing a larger surface of marshy ground for the sun to act upon, and, consequently, a greater amount of malarious exhalations than would be engendered by the inundation alone. Temperature .166 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. Marching.SIND DISTRICT OF THE ARMY. 167 H. M.'S 1ST SIND HORSE. JACOBABAD.168 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. However doubtless the Jacobabad floods in 1872 have been reported on by higher authori- ty, I may, however, mention that owing to the great quantity of water all round us, which has by no means dried up yet, have caused us to have a longer fever season; and, it appears to me, of a stronger and worse type than usual. As an instance, I may mention that in November 1871, sixty-four cases of intermittent fever were admitted. In the same month this year the admissions from the same disease were 104, and in December 1871 twenty-eight cases of remit- tent fever were admitted, and in the same month this year 65. Most likely the floods increasing yearly in this part of the country will doubtless draw the attention of the authorities to the propriety of maintaining troops, year after year, in a station so notoriously unhealthy, without ever giving them a change which would be as beneficial to the State as it would be to the health of the regiment. As I presume it is considered neces- sary to keep up regiments here, doubtless the health and physique of the men are deserving of consideration. I have taken the liberty of pointing out before how beneficial and absolutely necessary it is that regiments should get a change from Jacobabad that I have not much more to add. Having more experience of the place I have become further strengthened in my opinion, and, I also may add, that large quantities of jungle springing up all round and increasing floods are making matters worse. The fever is in my opinion of a worse type, and I should think, after some time, we shall likely have jungle fever. European officers suffered very severely from repeated attacks of fever, many being obliged to go away on leave. The men are below par in physique, and age very fast, which is owing no doubt to the climate. The lines are in an unsatisfactory condition: new ones are I believe about to be built. Large quantities of trees have been cut down this year which may possibly make the station a little cooler. Prevailing winds S.E. and N.E. from May to October: N.W. and E. from November till April. Considerable shock of an earthquake felt on the night of the 15th December, lasting, according to opinions, from half a minute to a minute and a half or more. H. M.'s 2ND REGIMENT SIND HORSE.

From the station being so densely wooded and so intersected by canals (which, after the inundations have subsided, are full of stagnant water, swarming with fish that are left to de- compose in the channels as the water evaporates and percolates through the soil; the stench arising from this cause, towards the end of November and in the beginning of December, is something horrid), it becomes enveloped in a damp stagnant atmosphere during the absence of the north-east wind. The effects of this atmosphere on the constitution of the men is most pernicious; almost all the men who have been admitted into the hospital during the six weeks that I have been in medical charge of the regiment, suffered from an171 SIND DISTRICT OF THE ARMY. criterion of the extent of the disease.

This year, to increase as it were the stagnation of air caused by the lower branches of trees and undergrowth of sorts, on a large piece of land within camp limits quantities of jowaree were allowed to be grown. The malari- ous fever caused about 12 per cent more admissions this year than last, not only that the numbers were greater this year, but the type was lower and men took longer to recover and became more debilitated after an attack.

180 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. REPORT BY THE DEPUTY INSPECTOR GENERAL OF HOSPITALS, SIND DIVISION. In the present report I have no mention to make of any regiments having left the Sind Districts, or of any new ones having come to it; neither have I to notice any changes in the disposition of the several corps serving in the province. One or two detachments were moved from the Sind Brigade during the rainy season, the circumstances attending which will give rise to some remarks further on; but as these all returned during the year to head-quarters, the actual position of the different regiments was not thereby affected. The several corps therefore stand precisely as they did this time last year, and are181 SIND DISTRICT OF THE ARMY. 4. The second factor, and the one mainly responsible for the increase of sickness in the province, has been the inundation of the river Indus, which was greatly aggravated by the giving way in several places of some of the larger canal bunds. The river began to rise in May, and rapidly increased. In July it burst over the country above Kusmore, and towards the end of that month the amount of water which made its appearance in the neighbourhood of Jacobabad seriously alarmed the inhabitants for its safety, shortly afterwards the whole country round was in flood; communication with Shikarpur and Sakkhar was entirely cut off, except by boat, and continued so for nearly three months. During a portion of this time the water partially flooded the parade ground and surrounded the Rifle lines, and almost swamped the married quarters of that regiment. Considerable damage likewise was done to several of the officers' compounds. In short, matters had proceeded so far that I am told it was only through great exertion on the part of the authorities, and the embankments for the most part remaining firm and intact, that the entire station of Jacobabad was saved from very serious injury. It was several months before this large body of water disappeared, absorption and evaporation being the only means for its disposal. As an instance of the difficulties attending progression in these parts, even so late as the setting in of the cold season, I may mention that in the beginning of November, the 2nd Regiment Sind Horse was ordered to Sakkhar on the occasion of the Viceroy's visit. The distance is 49 miles, but owing to the flooded state of the country, the route was rendered so circuitous as to extend the march to 60 miles. And even by the middle of December, when I passed up from Shikarpur, a portion of the road was still impracticable, and much of the land also on either side was under water, for the most part stagnant and offensive, and containing numbers of dead fish in all stages of putrefaction. In Haidarabad likewise, the unusually high condition of the river did not fail to exercise injurious effects upon the inhabitants and troops stationed there. The low land surrounding that part of the plateau on which the camp is placed, and specially that portion situated to the west of the Fort, which is every autumn more or less marshy, were entirely inundated; and there being in this region a great amount of vegetation and numbers of trees, the immense mass of decomposing organic matter left on the surface, after the subsidence of the water, proves a sure and fertile source of malarious disease. And during the past year the climate towards the latter part, has unfortunately been exactly such as to further the development and dissemi- nation of the malarial poison. Cold is supposed either to kill, or keep in abeyance this poi- son, or to brace the nervous system with some special power to withstand its effects. But last year, the usual cold which prevails in November and December, particularly in Upper Sind, was absent: the latter portion of the year was unusually mild, the sun's power during the day time considerable, and the winds being light and variable, and even at times scarcely percepti- ble. The circumstances were all specially favourable for the production of malaria, as also its reception by those whose impaired health or low state of vital energy, rendered them predis- posed to its effects. 5. The last element which has contributed to swelling the returns of sickness for the year under review, in at least two out of six regiments serving in Sind, has been dengue fever. This disease was imported into Kurrachee from Bombay during the monsoon, most probably by one of the weekly steamers. It began to show itself in the native town about the begin- ning of July; and shortly afterwards some cases presented themselves for treatment at the dispensary and civil hospital. The type of disease was mild on its first appearance. As it continued to increase in the town, precautions were taken to prevent its reaching camp, by prohibiting the sepoys to go into the city. Although this in some measure may have delayed its progress, yet, not long afterwards, some cases were reported in the bazaar and outlying huts of the followers. The disease spread and in the early part of September broke out in the lines of the 27th or 1st Belooch Regiment. During that month 71 cases were admitted, and in the one following as many as 276. In December the disease was on the decline, there being only 63 admissions from this cause. A total of 412 cases, however, out of a strength of 668, was met with. There were no casualties, nor were any of the European officers affected. The disease was next heard of at Haidarabad. It made great havoc in the city182 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. on one side of the Indus, and Haidarabad on the other, it would not be long until its presence would be felt in both these localities, which in fact occurred. It was natural likewise to suppose that the traffic up the Indus, especially by means of the passenger steamers, would certainly convey the disease to the several places of contact on its banks. This came to pass as regards Sakkhar only. This place has a considerable trade, and here steamers generally remain for a day or more during their passage up and down. Two hundred and thirty cases of dengue came under treatment here, and many others also were affected with it but were either too ignorant or too indifferent to seek medical aid. On the other side of the Indus, exactly opposite Sakkhar, lies the considerable town of Rohri. Hourly intercourse by steam-ferry is kept up between the two. Finding that not a single case of dengue had been treated at the dispensary there, I enquired of the authorities with respect to its presence in the town, and was surprised to learn that the disease was quite unknown in the place. A singular circum- stance, if correctly stated. Shikarpur, which is 23, and Jacobabad, 49 miles distant from Sakkhar, each of them forming important links in the chain of communication and traffic to the northward, entirely escaped. With the exception of the places I have already mentioned, and three others, not far from the Indus, the disease seems to have passed up the river, leaving Sind comparatively untouched. 7. Having referred to the general causes which have excercised a baneful influence on the health of the troops serving in Sind during the past year, and occasioned an increase of one fourth nearly in the deathrate, I proceed to mention the total average strength; numbers treated and died; the daily average sick; the percentage of treated to strength, of deaths to strength, of deaths to treated; of the diseases affecting the men as a body, and the proportion in which the castes of Hindoos and Mahomedans suffered; then the numbers of each who have died out of hospital and been invalided; the number of recruits joined during the year; and, lastly, the history of the several regiments. In the appendices to this report marked, respec- tively, B, C, D, E, these and other matters are given in full detail, and it will, therefore, be necessary to only summarise them here very briefly. 8. The average strength of the troops serving in Sind for the year 1872 amounted to 2,844 which is less by 243 than in the previous year. Including those remaining at the close of 1871, the total number treated has been 5,216. The average daily sick per cent. to average strength was 4.6; while the ratio per cent. to admissions to average strength amounted to 177.2. The deaths in hospital numbered 74 which gives a ratio of 1.4 deaths to treated, and a percentage of 2.6 to the average strength. The previous year showed a percentage of 1.8, which contrasts unfavourably with the ratio for the whole native Army, and now for the year just concluded this will be still more apparent, as the mortality has been nearly one fourth in excess of what occurred in the preceeding year. 9. In commenting on the diseases affecting the troops as a body, it is natural in a country like Sind, especially in its upper portion, where not only malaria spreads itself over a much wider surface and in a more persistent manner than in Lower Sind, but where also the troops stationed there exceed those at Haidarabad and Kurrachee, in the proportion of 7 to 2, to look for a larger number of admissions from fever. And such is the case. A total of 2,654 cases of malarious fever have been treated, which divided through the average strength 2,844 is equal very nearly to every man of the Force having been once affected during the year. In my last report, 2,378 cases of malarious fevers are noted in a strength of 3,087 with a mortality of 20, or a percentage of 0.6 deaths to strength. For the year under review, while the sick- ness from this cause has been greater, the mortality has been less, 17 deaths having occurred, or equal to 0.5 per cent. on the average strength. 10. Of the remaining diseases classified as "General," under the nomenclature of 1868, Sec. A, dengue holds an important place183 SIND DISTRICT OF THE ARMY. ing to the regiments184 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. while diseases of the spleen show a total of 30 without any death. Diseases of the urinary system and organs, and of the generative system, may be noticed together. These have yielded 81 cases and no deaths, which favourably contrasts with the admissions of the previous year, which numbered 132. There only remains to notice diseases of the organs of locomotion of the cellular and cutaneous systems and injuries. These of course furnish a considerable number of admissions; in all 1,068, and the deaths have amounted to 8, of which 5 were occasioned by debility. In the year before last 1,200 admissions are recorded from the above causes, but followed by only 2 deaths, also from debility. 14. Before dismissing the subject of the diseases which have affected the troops in Sind as a body, I must mention one which, although in certain forms is of common occurrence all over the Bombay Presidency, yet in this province, and partially so in Cutch, is not only more prevalent, but frequently assumes such peculiar characteristics, as to have earned for itself a distinct name of "Sind Sore." In the regimental returns these are entered under the general head of Boils and Ulcers; for even in the worst and most intractable form of this affection, it commences generally as a painful boil: and, after a period more or less protected, leaves an ulcer having certain peculiarities in its appearance, progress, duration, and, especi- ally, resistance to remedies. In 1871 boils and ulcers numbered 359: during the past year they have amounted to 419. For the most part, these were ordinary boils and ulcers not distinguishable from those met with elsewhere, except, perhaps, in the matter of, general irritability and sluggishness of action. But the others, of which I wish now to speak, the Sind sore par excellence, though at its commencement, and for sometime after, differing little from an irritable and ill-conditioned boil, yet becoming influenced by climate and local circumstances, also by the constitution or habit of body of the patient, it must, in its progress and subsequent course, be regarded rather as a distinct disease, and in this stage presents all the chief characteristics of the Delhi sore. 15. My attention has been lately directed to this matter by the Commissioner in Sind having forwarded me copies of correspondence on the subject of Delhi Sores from the Government of India. These included a despatch from H. M.'s Secretary of State, conveying a letter from General Lord Mark Kerr, stating that, as the result of his experience at Delhi, he believed that planting of trees and grass alleviate the disease known under the name of Delhi sore; and information was called for, as to how far the presence of trees, grass, and vegetation, generally, with judicious draining, would similarly alleviate the disease in this province called Sind sore. 16. In reply I stated that to some extent it was a matter for regret, that a disease concerning which information is sought should be named after a locality instead of being described and classified in accordance with its pathological history. And this was the more unfortunate, inasmuch as without this well-established method of recognition, other diseases of a kindred kind were liable to be confounded with it. Another source of difficulty was experienced in the fact that ulcers and boils of an obstinate and untractable character are not confined to Delhi, but are more or less spread over India and eastern cities generally. This would indicate that there is nothing in the complaint specially referable to Delhi, but that the cause must be searched for over a wide extent of country, exhibiting every shade and variety of topographical character, and with climates very dissimilar. With respect to the obstinate sores met with in Sind, there appears to exist much difference of opinion as to there being identical with the Delhi sore. Some consider them alike, others that they are nearly so, but modified by climatic influences; but the general verdict seems to favour the opinion that the ordinary Sind sore is essentially different from the Delhi one, at least in its earlier stages and during a portion of its subsequent course. At the outset and for sometime after, the disease usually presents the appearance of an ill-conditioned boil having many of the character- istics of carbuncle, attended with acute suffering, and remaining in a highly inflammatory and irritable condition frequently for several successive weeks. In this respect it is quite unlike the commencement and course of Delhi sore, which is not painful until after a considerable breach of surface has taken place, and even then the pain is comparatively insignificant, and never approaches that met with in the earlier stages of the Sind sore, which is of an intense lancinating character. And it is when this inflammatory condition has been reduced by appro- priate treatment that the peculiar disintegration of the tissues occurs. And then commences the intractable and obstinate condition which in all its main features corresponds to the descrip- tions usually given of the Delhi sore. This is my opinion; and, I think, it is borne out by the observations of most of the medical officers who of late years have served in Sind and given their attention to the subject. Dr. T. Farquhar, a retired Surgeon Major of H. M.'s Bengal Medical Service, who has had considerable experience in Delhi sores and in those peculiar to Sind, also states that while the Delhi sore may exist separately in Sind, he considers the disease known as Sind sore to be "furunculus"185 SIND DISTRICT OF THE ARMY. 17. Assuming that the complaint as witnessed in Sind is, at least in its fully developed stage, sufficiently alike in its chief feature to the Delhi sore which, according to Lord Mark Kerr's experience, is alleviated so signally by the proximity of trees and grass, it will be expe- dient now to consider how far in like manner the presence of trees, vegetation, and cultivation of the soil, generally, have influenced the prevalence and practicableness of the Sind sore. 18. I entirely concur in the general principle enunciated, that to bring extensive tracts of barren and waste land under judicious irrigation and cultivation in connection with a good water-supply, careful and thorough drainage, and other well-ordered sanitary arrangements, would do much towards the removal of epidemic diseases generally; would also greatly miti- gate the severity of epidemics, and by improving the general health of the inhabitants, would place them in a more favourable position to resist malarious poisoning and other debilitating influences, which, under existing circumstances, are too frequently met with, and which render the people susceptible to ailments of otherwise trifling import; and I have no doubt, if the above measures were scientifically and thoroughly adopted, Sind sore would be greatly alleviated, and in time might even disappear. But I cannot endorse the opinion that the par- tial and desultory planting of trees, with even all the provisos I have mentioned, and which, in most cases, would be impracticable, would exercise any appreciable influence in lessening the frequency or alleviating the condition of these sores; and, moreover, I believe that unless all the sanitary conditions I have noticed be carefully carried out in their entirety, the presence of trees, particularly in large numbers in a country like Sind, is attended with results rather the reverse of those mentioned by Lord Mark Kerr. In making this statement it must be borne in mind that Sind, unlike other tropical countries, is without a regular annual rainfall. Rain certainly is met with, but it is uncertain, partial, and generally scanty, and can never be de- pended upon as a means of irrigation. But Sind, like Egypt, has another and very abundant source from which it derives its chief water-supply. I mean the river Indus; and the country being for the most part perfectly flat186 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. 20. While malaria therefore is endemic, abundant sub-surface water present, and drainage impracticable, I think I may safely affirm that in a country like Sind, experience proves that the planting of trees, grass, &c., would neither diminish the frequency of the sores peculiar to the province, alleviate their progress, nor shorten their course; but on the contrary, I am amongst the number of those who consider they would become aggravated thereby. 21. To return from this digression, I proceed to notice the proportion in which the two classes, Hindoo and Mahomedan, have contributed to the general sickness during the year under report. The strength of the former is 732, of the latter 2,811. From the first, 977 ad- missions are recorded, and 20 deaths: from the last 3,743 admissions and 52 deaths. The Hindoos, therefore, show a considerable higher deathrate than do the Mahomedans. This amounts to 2.7, while that for the Mahomedans is 1.3, proving that the latter from their greater consumption of nitrogenous elements in their food, are better capable of resisting the tendency to death than are the other class, whose diet, from their larger use of cereals, contain a greater amount of starch. 22. The returns show that 24 men died out of hospital and on leave, but these are not given according to caste: 127 were invalided, 18 being Hindoos and 109 Mahomedans. This shows a percentage to strength of 2 of the former and 3.7 of the latter, which apparently rather militates against the theory advanced in the preceding paragraph, but while the Mahomedans at least during youth possess greater stamina and power than the Hindoos to resist, under sick- ness, the tendency to a fatal issue, it would seem that, owing to their habits being generally more dissipated, they become sooner worn out and unfit for hard work. Executive officers are well aware of the greater frequency of rheumatic complaints187 SIND DISTRICST OF THE ARMY. dengue already noticed188 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. cularly obstinate and only improving on the approach of the cold season. They were nearly all of them examples of the Sind sore. 13 children where successfully vaccinated. There only remain 5 children unprotected, but on whom the operation will be performed when old enough. No report has been made of any cases of revaccination. 9 men were invalided. 28. While the admissions in the 1st Regiment Sind Horse are one-third fewer than in the 30th N.I., the percentage of treated to strength and deaths to treated are almost identical; the figures used in the one would be equally correct if employed for noting the same parti- culars in the other. The numbers treated for the year show an increase of 65 over 1871; and the deathrate is especially high, 3.6 being the ratio for the past year, whereas 2.5 was that for the previous one. 405 cases of malarious fever were treated out of a strength of 354, with only 1 death. Pneumonia figures largely: 23 admissions and 9 deaths being returned from this disease alone. Dysentery gives 19 cases and 1 casualty; and splenitis shows 14 admissionsSIND DISTRICT OF THE ARMY. 189 notices this disease at all, the 2nd Sind Horse having had four cases. Assistant Surgeon Carswell has found the application of the ointment biniodide of mercury, as recommended by Professor Maclean of Netley, serviceable in reducing the size of the organ. There have been 122 admissions from boils and ulcers, which is more than double the number noticed in either the 1st or 2nd Regiments Sind Horse. Assistant Surgeon Carswell remarks on their intract- able character, and considers them the result indirectly of climate. Contusions represent 84 admissions. In mounted regiments it is natural to expect a large number of injuries of this class, and as the duties of all are nearly alike and performed at the same station, the proportion should be pretty equal. It is somewhat remarkable, therefore, that just twice the number should have been received in the 3rd Regiment than in the 2nd190 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. cots and the few articles of hospital clothing. These could be washed in the bazar at a very small cost. A washerman also is totally unnecessary with a regiment on field service, as it carries no cots with it, and the clothing it takes is extremely limited, and confined nearly ex- clusively to woollen or quilted materials which are seldom washed. 33. I will take this opportunity of pointing out where, in another direction, also a most important saving to Government might be affected without sacrificing efficiency in the smallest degree. In all the military hospitals I have found a large and varied assortment of surgical instruments and appliances. The operations annually performed in the regiments are, as a rule, insignificant, and, except in very rare instances, a pocket case, or at most the Capital in- strument case, which they all have, supply nearly every thing that is required. Where then is the necessity of each regiment, and, especially, where several are at the same station, possess- ing separate sets of instruments, such as amputating, cupping, midwifery, dissecting, post mortem, teeth, besides urinometers, stomach pumps, electro-magnetic machines, speculums auri and vagin191 SIND DISTRICT OF THE ARMY. 37. The lines of the 30th Regiment N.I. are on the whole good. They would be greatly improved by having an open verandah built along the front of the pendalls to keep the sun off the sepoys' rooms; and, also, they should be prevented building up their doorways, which they do on account of the cold, until they leave merely sufficient space to creep in and out. The hospital is a good one and the accommodation sufficient; but no remedy has been provided for the objection I took the year before last, to the numerous blocks of houses for commissariat followers who crowd round the hospital. There being no fireplace as in the other hospitals at Jacobabad, a stove is being made for heating this one. 38. In last year's report the accommodation for the men of the 1st Regiment Sind Horse was described as very unsatisfactory. The space is far too limited, each room represents a cube of 8 feet; the floor is not raised; there are no ventilators, neither any outside verandah. I was told, however, that sanction had been obtained for new ones being erected. The hospital áccommodation would be much too limited for a line regiment; but owing to the system ob- taining in these mounted regiments, mentioned elsewhere, of allowing the moderately sick to be treated as out-patients, the inconvenience is not felt. The fireplace, an absolute necessity in the winter months at this station, which I recommended to be built at my former inspection, has not yet been made. The repair of the hospital is good, but it has the same objection as the others have, viz., the houses of camp followers abutting on it. 39. The huts, or rather hovels, of the men of the 2nd Regiment Sind Horse were in even a worse condition, if possible, than when I inspected them in 1871. They are totally unfit to live in, and that this regiment does not present a much higher deathrate, is only an in- stance of that peculiar compensating power of nature which accommodates the human system to exist under the most adverse circumstances. They have been, however, formally condemned and sanction obtained for new ones being built. Hospital accommodation is sufficient on the principle stated when speaking of that for the 1st Regiment. No remedy, I fear, can be ap- plied to remove the great objection complained of in respect to its site, the lines being im- mediately in front, the married men's quarters close behind. The former are kept as clean as circumstances will admit of; the latter are considered sacred, and their sanitary condition, therefore, can be more easily imagined than described. 40. With respect to the lines of the 3rd Regiment described in my previous report, I have nothing to add. They are as nearly perfect as buildings of this description can be, and it is to be hoped that the new ones about to be constructed will be 'built on the same model. The description given of the hospital of the 2nd Regiment will apply equally well to this one, as they are both under one roof192 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. therefore, a necessary consequence, and, although these are likewise fed by the sub-surface water stored up from the annual inundation of the river which covers a considerable surface of the low-lying ground in the neighbourhood, yet, by the beginning of the hot season, this supply is nearly exhausted; and last year previous to the rising of the Indus, the water in these wells was not only extremely deficient, but so charged with mud and other impurities as to be scarce- ly fit for use. As at Kurrachee various plans for obtaining a pure and plentiful supply of water have been at different times put forward; and when it is remembered that the Indus is within 4 miles, and a branch, the Foolaile, not half that distance, it is a marvel that hitherto nothing has been done to supply this great want193 SIND DISTRICT OF THE ARMY. tive; 17° is the highest, which was for the month of May; 3° the lowest noted in September. In the previous month it was slightly higher, 4°. It is during these two months that the at- mosphere is loaded nearly to saturation; and it was in these months observed also that no breeze was perceptible. The general direction of the wind was from January to 15th April N.N.W. and N.E. From April to end of July, E. and S. E., while in October, November, and December, the prevailing winds were from the E. and N.E. As the above observations are from a reliable source, I am glad to be able to record them, as they quite remove the misconceptions which were found in the previous year in respect to the relative temperature of Jacobabad and Haidarabad, and which it is now evident were based on erroneous data. 47. The system of conservancy known under the name of Trench-latrines, which was sought to be introduced in the Belooch regiment at Kurrachee in 1871, and which was empha- tically condemned for the reasons stated in my report for that year, was ordered to be carried into practice in the month of April last. Shortly afterwards the nuisance became so intoler- able that a committee, of which I was president, was appointed by the officer commanding the district to report on the subject. We had the ground dug up in several places around the latrines and found that its uniform condition was a mixture of rounded stones194 SKETCH OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BOMBAY. 49.There is a point in connection with the conservancy of Jacobabad to which I made especial reference in my report for 1871, and which, I think, ought to be insisted upon, as I believe it plays no insignificant part in the general causes which, by common consent, confer such an unenviable notoriety for unhealthiness upon this frontier station. The roads in and around Jacobabad are computed at 15 miles; and I allude to the practice of annually covering these more or less with quantities of the elephant grass (typha elephantina,) where it lies to rot until replaced the following year with fresh. But during all this time it receives into it the dung of cattle and other organic refuse, which in wet weather becomes of course most offensive, and in which state it must necessarily prove a source of unhealthiness to the community, and especially in the sadar bazar, against which it would not be diffi- cult to bring various charges of neglect of the most common rules of sanitation; it would be very desirable to exclude this additional element in the production of disease. The obvious remedy for this evil is, in the absence of stone, to make the roads of pounded bricks and lime; and there being materials at hand in the numerous old ruins, walls, and deserted lines, no great expense would be necessary to make a fair commencement; and every year would witness a gradual extension. If the above suggestions for the sanitary improvement of Jacobabad were completely carried out, some of the causes of local disease would be, if not re- moved, at least greatly diminished, and the healthiness of the station increased in corresponding degree. But I would not be misunderstood or have it supposed that, even under these altered circumstances, Jacobabad would not always rank as the most unhealthy station for troops in the whole Bombay Presidency. 50. With the statistics of the past year before me, and especially taking into considera- tion the continued unsatisfactory condition of the 30th Regiment N.I., I can only repeat what I said in my report for 1871, regarding the desirableness of removing the whole of the Upper. Sind Brigade for a period of not less than 3 years to a more healthy climate. [Table
