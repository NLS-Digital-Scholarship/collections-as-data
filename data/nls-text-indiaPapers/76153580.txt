Hostels.3 Expenditure of the College. 24. The main results and the receipts and expenditure of the College are given in Table I. The statement of receipts and expenditure has been compiled by me and verified by the Accountant-General, Bengal. GENERAL REMARKS. The additional Imperial Officer sanctioned for the College in 1914 has not yet been available, though the College stands in great need of the services of such an officer. 2. The teaching staff was short throughout the year of one of its members whose duties had to be distributed among the other members of the College in addition to their own. Moreover, one teacher has not enjoyed the best of health and another has had serious illness in his family, so that, with an already depleted staff under the circumstances, they must all have given of their best and are to be congratulated on the results of the examinations. 3. In consequence of the promotion to the 2nd grade of 3rd grade Deputy Superintendent, Mr. S. K. Mitra, last year, Mr. N. L. Mitra, Chief Glanders Inspector, was appointed 3rd grade Deputy Superintendent on 1st July. The post of a 1st grade Deputy Superintendent having been vacant last year by the death of Mr. Brand, Mr. D. Dey, 2nd grade Deputy Superintendent, was promoted to the 1st grade on the 1st October and Mr. S. S. Ahmed, a 3rd grade Deputy Superintendent, was promoted to the 2nd grade, made vacant by Mr. Dey's promotion, on the same date. The place of the latter has been recommended to Government to be filled in July next by promoting the Chief Glanders Inspector, Babu G. N. Chatterjee. 4. Mr. R. V. Pillai, Laboratory Assistant, was temporarily appointed Veterinary Supervisor on military duty to bring mules from China to India from 27th September to the end of the year. From reports received his work was most satisfactory. 5. Staff.4 RAYMOND RESEARCH LABORATORY. The Laboratory did good and useful work during the year. 2. One hundred and six brains of suspected rabid dogs, received either from the College hospital or elsewhere were examined and. 74 certified as rabies. Persons bitten by these dogs were recommended to undergo anti- rabic treatment. 3. Two hundred and fifty-eight pathological specimens were received for examination, chiefly from Bengal and Bihar and Orissa. Forty-one Hæmorrhagic Septicaemia, 26 Anthrax, 11 Surra, 4 Black Quarter, 4 Fowl Septicaemia and 3 Piroplasmosis were diagnosed. 4. The Imperial Serologist, Calcutta, and the Director, Pasteur Institute, Shillong, were supplied, on request, with morbid materials for their work. Guinea-pigs and rabbits were also supplied to Muktesar Laboratory and Pasteur Institute, Shillong, for experimental purposes. 5. At the instance of Messrs. Landale & Clark, several samples of bone- meal were collected and tested for Anthrax and other pathogenic organisms before being exported from the Calcutta port. 6. To meet Calcutta and district demands, considerable amounts of serum, vaccine, etc., were stocked in the serum-pit of the Laboratory. During the year, 187,553 doses of anti-rinderpest serum, 24,304 of anti- hæmorrhagic septicaemia serum, 8,165 of anti-anthrax serum, 148 of mallein and 34 of tuberculin were supplied to Calcutta and various districts of the province. 7. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bihar and Orissa, was supplied with a set of Anatomical wall maps, drawn by the Artist-Photo- grapher of this College for demonstration purposes in Bihar. The College magic-lantern with slides of various infective diseases of animals and specimens of well-bred cattle was sent out to districts for exhibi- tion at the fairs. A.

In the Sundarbans where the Deputy Superinten- dent was deputed to work in connection with this outbreak, he noticed that carcasses were either thrown into the river or allowed to be devoured by the vultures. This resulted in the spread of the infection in the surrounding localities. The importance of cremation and the deep burial of the carcasses as instructed by the officers of this Department was recognised by Sir Daniel Hamilton, and he issued prompt orders to that effect to his raiyats at Gosaba, but unfortunately in the neighbouring abad of Basanti little or no attention was paid to this instruction. 14. Other Contagious Diseases.4 20. The building of the Veterinary Hospital and Dispensary at Jalpai- guri was nearing completion at the close of the year. 21. At Brahmanberia in Tippera and at Feni in Noakhali lands have been acquired for the construction of dispensaries with quarters for the Veterinary Assistants. 22. In the Noakhali town acquisition of lands has been made for the erection of temporary buildings for the Veterinary Dispensaries, as the site of the dispensary is in danger of being washed away by the river which is threatening the whole town. 23. The construction of dispensaries with quarters for the Veterinary Assistants of Rajshahi and Pabna is being delayed for want of funds, though lands for the purpose were acquired by the District Boards concerned so far back as 1916. 24. Acquisition of lands is reported to have been made in the Khulna district for veterinary stores and assistants' quarters at Satkhira and Bagerhat. At Satkhira the buildings have been, commenced, while at Bagerhat the existing erection (thatched) have been temporarily utilised. 25. The total number of in and out-patients treated during the year was 34,889 as against 37,785 in the previous year. The decrease in the number of cases was due to the occurrence of less number of foot-and-mouth cases, and in some instances to the assistants having to be granted leave although no substitutes were available due to our depleted staff. Part III.5 32. Table VII shows in detail the distribution of assistants in the various districts of this Province. 33. During the year one Veterinary Assistant died, one was discharged and eight were on military duty. Four new posts for which sanction had been received previously were also opened during the year. Eleven new graduates were received from the College, and they were absorbed in filling up old and new vacancies. Sodepur Pinjrapole entertained one more Veteri- nary Assistant during the year. 34.

Glanders was detected in two and Surra in three stables. In the mufassal 27 deaths from glanders were reported as against 67 in the previous year. 6. Two new dispensaries were opened in the district of Bakarganj during the year, bringing the total number of such institutions up to 27. The number of patients treated during the year was 34,889 as against 37,785 in the previous year. The decrease is attributed to the fall in the number of cases of foot-and-mouth disease. The Governor in Council notices with satisfaction that arrangements are being made by certain District Boards to construct veterinary dispensaries. 7. The number of stud bulls kept by Government and local bodies decreased from 71 in the previous year to 68. The Governor in Council notices with pleasure the gift by Babu Dukhaja Mohan Chaudhuri of a good Montgomery bull to the veterinary dispensary in Rangpur district. 8. The work of the Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, Inspectors and of the staff of the Bengal Veterinary College was satisfactory. His Excellency in Council records his appreciation of the services of Lt.-Col. Smith, whose duties are arduous owing to the shortage in the leaching staff and the absence on military duty of officers of the depart- ment. By order of the Governor in Council, L.
