ANNUAL REPORT ON THE Civil Veterinary Department, UNITED PROVINCES, FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31ST MARCH 1912. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] ALLAHABAD: PRINTED BY F. LUKER, SUPDT., GOVERNMENT PRESS, UNITED PROVINCES. 1912.
No.1351/x-743 OF 1912. FROM THE HON'BLE MR. H. R. C. HAILEY, I.C.S., OFFG. DIRECTOR OF LAND RECORDS AND AGRICULTURE, UNITED PROVINCES, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, UNITED PROVINCES, INDUSTRIES DEPARTMET, NAINI TAL. Dated Lucknow, the 26th of June 1912. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the report on the administration of the Civil Veterinary Department for the year ending 31st March 1912. The record of the year's work fully bears out Mr. Oliver's claim that the Civil Veterinary Department is steadily increasing in efficiency, while the scope of its operations is rapidly extending. There is ample evidence of an increased readiness on the part of the public to avail themselves of the assistance afforded by the officers of the department. 2. With the extending operations the difficulty of obtaining recruits in sufficient numbers from these provinces to staff the department is becoming more acute. At my request the Director of Public Instruction has circularised the head masters of the High Schools, pointing out the advantages of service in the department. If this measure fails to meet with an adequate response, it may become necessary to fall back on the suggestion made in the report of recruiting from outside the provinces. 3. Since the writing of the report sanction has been given to the proposal for a grant of compensation in deserving cases to owners of animals suffering from glanders, the destruction of which has been found necessary. It is hoped that such grants will induce the smaller and less enlightened owners to bring to light cases of the disease of which there is at present a tendency to conceal. 4. The want of accommodation at the laboratory alluded to in the report will form the subject of a separate communication. Lack of space is militating against its usefulness as a research and teaching centre. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, H. R. C. HAILEY, Offg. Director.
(Maximum limit of reportii TABLE No. PAGE. Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department United Provinces, 1911-1912. 1. The administration report of the department for the year ending March 31st, 1912, is herewith submitted. 2. I held charge of the department throughout the year, and Mr. C. W. Wilson carried out the duties of Second Superintendent. 3. I was 135 days on tour and travelled 607 miles by road and 19,079 by rail. I toured in 22 districts, supervising the veterinary inspectors, and the work of the district board veterinary assistants, as well as the veterinary hospitals and dispensaries under this department. Sites for establishing more of these institutions were also seen and selected. I inspected most of the stallion stands, and the stud bulls maintained by local bodies and private estates. It was necessary on several occasions to visit the stallion dépôt at Moradabad for inspection and selection of these animals for issue to districts; and a great deal of time had to be spent at the newly established bull-rearing farm at Kheri. During these tours district officers, landowners, and others interested in the rearing of stock were interviewed and conferred with. I visited the Awagarh estate with a view to re-establishing the breeding stud there; also other estates to advise on cattle-breeding schemes. I inspected the various dak-tonga lines, and where possible the working bullocks of the most important municipalities were seen. I travelled to Bombay for the purchase of stallions, and visited the Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory, Mukhtesar, to confer with Major Holmes on the question of serum and vaccines. Shows and fairs were attended, and I officiated on the horse and cattle judging committee at the Khairabad agricultural show. I personally attended and carried out investigation and research in 22 outbreaks of disease and where necessary directed inoculations and experiments. 4. Mr. Wilson, Second Superintendent, was on tour 142 days, during which time he travelled 437 miles by road and 14,525 miles by rail. He toured in 22 districts, inspecting the work of the subordinate veterinary staff, attending outbreaks of contagious diseases and conducting inoculations and research operations. He was deputed to Dehra Dun for the investigation of surra and attended the Karwi and Sardhua cattle fairs, and the agricultural exhibitions at Hardoi, Rae Bareli and Sultanpur. He visited the Government cattle farm, Hissar, for the purpose of selecting bulls for various local bodies and private estates, and attended Lahore, Bombay and Madras to act on the board of examiners at the annual examinations at the veterinary colleges. All the stallion stands in his circle were inspected and sites were selected for proposed new dispensaries. He personally was present and carried out investigations in 18 outbreaks of disease. VETERINARY INSTRUCTION. 5. As suitable training in inoculation work and methods is now provided at the veterinary colleges, it has been found unnecessary to depute the newly joined veterinary assistants to the laboratory at Mukhtesar for this purpose; hence a great saving in time and expense is effected. The new graduates on joining the department are now given practical demonstrations in elementary bacteriology and research methods at the head quarters laboratory at Lucknow before sending them out to districts; and when possible they are allowed to accompany an inspector to outbreaks of disease where inoculations are conducted, thus gaining some practical experience in the field. 6. It is to be regretted that the offer of scholarships for the training of students at the veterinary colleges fails to attract but a very few young men to enter the profession, although every opportunity has been taken to give it publicity and encourage candidates. The reason may be that the class of man available in these provinces has not the natural inclination for practical work amongst horses and other domesticated animals (such as is the case with many Punjabis and other Northern races), usually preferring clerical work. It is moreover noticed that from those who become qualified only a small percentage develop into first- class practitioners. During the year under report very few presented themselves for selection, none of which proved either eligible or suitable. With the
(2) daily increasing demand for the services of veterinary assistants some action seems necessary. If from bonâ fide inhabitants of these provinces suitable students are not forthcoming, I would suggest that the scholarships may be thrown open to men from the Punjab and other provinces, provided of course that they undertake to serve this government when qualified. 7. Of the students deputed to Bengal, one in the final class has successfully passed his examinations and joined the department and two in the second-year class have passed into the final year's class. At the Lahore College out of five in the final class three have qualified and will now join the department. The five students in the second class have passed into the final. One failed in one subject and will be re-examined in June, and one has been allowed to study for another year. A specially selected student has been sent to Bombay Veterinary College to be trained with a view to filling an appointment as deputy superintendent, and one inspector who has been promoted on probation to this new grade is undergoing a course of training at head quarters. 8. A monograph on the indigenous cattle of the United Provinces has been published and circulated amongst those interested in the question, and a bulletin dealing with surra is in the press and will shortly be published. TREATMENT OF DISEASE. See table II. 9. During the year under report there has been a satisfactory decrease in the extent of, and mortality from, contagious diseases. The cases notified from the whole of the province amounted to 38,510 against 1,23,695 of last year. The mortality in all animals is reported at 14,333, being less than half that of the previous year. A great improvement is noticeable in the direction of early notification of disease from districts, while the owners themselves are beginning to realize the advantage gained by securing veterinary aid in the early stages of the outbreaks. EQUINE. 10. As I mentioned in a previous report equine contagious disease occurring in the 4 selected horse-breeding districts, Muzaffarnagar, Aligarh, Bulandshahr and Meerut, is dealt with by the Army Remount department, while the Army Veterinary Corps deals with the affected animals in the various branches of the Military department. The figures here only refer to cases brought directly under the notice of the Civil Veterinary department. 11. Glanders and Farcy.(3) 16. Epizootic Lymphangitis.(4) a large number of goats in Garhwal and Dehra Dun. 1226 deaths from other diseases were reported among the small domesticated animals and included rabies, canine distemper, sheep-pox, fowl cholera and various parasitic ailments. PREVENTATIVE INOCULATION. See table III. 25. During the year under report inoculations have been conducted in 397 outbreaks of disease and 44,497 animals were treated by this method. With the exception of the Garhwal district, where the disease continued persistently for some months, there were very few serious outbreaks which were not speedily suppressed by it, and in Garhwal alone 17,329 animals were inoculated against rinderpest. From the fact that little or no opposition was encountered anywhere it is evident that this work still retains the confidence of the cattle-owning public. Under the new arrangement anti-rinderpest serum is supplied free to local bodies and the cost of the same is debited against the grant of Rs.37,500 sanctioned by the Provincial Government for the purpose. During the year under report the ravages of rinderpest have not been so severe as usual; hence the sum of Rs. 25,950 only was required against the grant of Rs. 37,500. OTHER DISEASES. See table IV. 26. During the past year there has been a still greater increase in the numbers of animals treated individually by veterinary assistants other than in outbreaks and epidemics (which has been already dealt with). 19,786 villages were visited and 23,415 cases were treated as compared with 20,892 reported last year. In addition to this the subordinate staff have castrated 306 animals, and attended 34,661 cases of contagious disease. INVESTIGATION OF DISEASE. 27. The new laboratory at head quarters has now been completed and is in working order for bacteriological and pathological investigation. During the year under report a number of experiments have been carried out and observations made in connection with certain diseases. Several animals suffering from &quot;Kumri&quot; have been received at the laboratory for treatment and observation and experiments have been carried out with a view of discovering the cause of the disease and a remedy for it. In some tracts considerable loss to horse owners annually results from the ravages of this malady, which up to the present has been but vaguely understood. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary department, would be glad of any cases for investigation, if owners would inform him when an outbreak or even a single case occurs. Further experiments carried out on the lines suggested by the Imperial Bacte- riologist to endeavour to establish a drug cure for &quot;surra&quot; have been continued and the results appear more encouraging than those of last year. At an outbreak at Fatehpur, one-third of the cases treated have not shown further symptoms and are believed to be cured. This treatment when carried out in the field is somewhat complicated and requires the presence constantly of a trained micro- scopist. It is hoped however that the present knowledge we have gained will in time lead to the discovery of some more easily applied and practicable method of treatment. During the year much work has been carried out in the laboratory in the examination of blood smears and other morbid material, viscera, and intestinal and other parasites of animals, which have been from time to time sent for examination and opinion, by veterinary inspectors, assistants, the police, district officers and others. The results were noted, in many cases diagnosis made, or confirmed; and the persons interested informed accordingly. Many cases of an interesting nature were discovered at slaughter houses in the course of meat inspection, by veterinary assistants specially deputed to visit these institutions. 28. Tuberculosis.(5) Now that the operations of the department are expanding, it has become very necessary to have at head quarters in connection with the laboratory some accommodation for animals under observation and experiment. It should fulfil a very useful purpose in the interests of general research and will be a place where the younger and inexperienced veterinary assistants can obtain experience and an up-to-date training in practical pathology, &c. 29. Cattle poisoning.(6) supporting carts and animals is a very urgent necessity and it is hoped that funds for this purpose will before long be forthcoming. (2) EQUINE. (UNDER LOCAL BODIES.) (i) Horse and pony stallions. See table X. 33. At the beginning of the year under report there were 55 stallions on the register, 53 being the property of the provincial government and 2 the property of court of wards. Since then these two have been removed. 34. Six stallions have been purchased by the department during the year, two were castrated and sold, being unfit for further stud work, and one was destroyed; leaving a balance of 56 at the close of the year. See table XI. 35. The number of mares covered during the year has amounted to 2,739, being a very satisfactory increase on that of previous years and amounting to 295 more than last year. Two stallion stands were opened during the year, viz. at Etawah and Awagarh. 36. As year by year we have been gradually replacing the old stallions (some of which were somewhat small) by young, sound sires of 14 hands and over, there has now arisen a noticeable increase in the demand for them; at the same time I regret that in some localities, although the breeders have represented the necessity for more facilities for horse breeding, district boards have been unable to meet their wishes from want of funds to defray the cost of maintenance. 37. Regarding the young stock got by the provincial stallions, a satisfactory feature is the distinct improvement and promise shown by them. Some exceptionally good youngsters in the districts of Moradabad, Budaun and Saharanpur have been seen, the progeny of the Arabs Jeddah, Exchange, Achilles, Akbar, Hannibal and Toby. 38. As the result of the interest shown in the matter by the special manager, Mr. Pullen, the breeding stud of the Awagarh Court of Wards has been reorganized and put on a sound footing. Six brood mares have been purchased by this department for the estate and 3 stallions have been lent from the provincial stud. (ii) Donkey Stallions. See table X. 39. At the beginning of the year there were 18 provincial donkeys on the register; one was added by purchase from the Hissar cattle farm and one was sold as being unfit for further stud purposes, one died, one belonging to Almorah district board was removed from register, being unfit for stud purposes, leaving a balance of 16 at the end of the year. Two donkey stallions were lent from this department to Rai Ishar Sahai of Fatehpur, who had bought a few mares for mule breeding. There seemed every hope of a successful issue as some good young mules were foaled, but unfortunately an untimely outbreak of surra amongst the brood mares necessitated the temporary postponement of further operations. The number of mares covered during the year amounted to 507. See table XI There appears to be still an increasing demand for the services of donkey stallions for mule breeding, but the limited number available renders it difficult to meet the demand. It is practically impossible to obtain a sufficient number of suitable animals in India, and it will be absolutely necessary to make some arrangements for importing them in the future if we wish to foster the mule breeding industry. SHEEP BREEDING. 40. During the year under report some steps have been taken to invesitgate the character of the existing stock as found in the plains tracts of the United Provinces, and the conditions under which they are reared and maintained. It is now proposed to carry out a series of breedign experiments with the object of ascertaining if there is any possibility of establishing a permanent improvement in the quality and quantity of the fleece of the indigenous flocks, and to obtain an accurate estimate of how far operations in this direction would be likely to be successful, if carried out on such scale as would be necessary, if wool production in India is in future years to be regarded as an economic resource. Small experimental flocks of ewes will be located in selected tracts in the province, with a view to find out what is the influence of climate, pasture, water and general environments of the various localities on sheep breeding
(7) generally. Observations and experiments in regard to shearing, dipping, feeding and general management will be carried out under responsible supervision. A number of merino rams are being imported from Australia and elsewhere where the temperature and climate most resemble that of India. These on arrival will be introduced into these experimental flocks where they can be properly looked after. An attempt will be made by judicious selection and mating to arrive at a definite conclusion whether a superior wool-producing strain can ultimately be evolved which will stand the vicissitudes of the Indian climate, and it should be possible to ascertain which parts of the province are most suited to sheep breeding and what classes of ewes are likely to turn out most successful. FAIRS AND SHOWS. See table XIV. 41. I personally attended and judged at the Khairabad agricultural show and attended cattle fairs at Kosi. Mr. Wilson was present at the Karwi and Sardhua cattle shows and the agricultural exhibitions connected with the districts of Hardoi, Rae Bareli and Sultanpur. Regarding the Karwi shows Mr. Wilson remarked that although there was an increase in the number of cattle, there was no noticeable improvement in the quality of the animals shown. As stated by this officer last year, this fair appears to be doing little or nothing towards the improvement of the cattle of the neighbourhood. The Sardhua fair has been more successful, and the type and character of the cattle found there appear more satisfactory. At the request of the Collector of Balia Rs. 200 was allotted and distributed in prizes at the Dadri cattle fair. After some years of experience of cattle shows in these provinces I endorse the opinion of Major Maxwell, a previous Superintendent in this department, made in 1905, that the present system of awarding prizes for cattle has proved anything but successful, and I would strongly recommend reconsideration of the question. I am submitting my views on the subject separately to the Director of Land Records and Agriculture for consideration. SUBORDINATE ESTABLISHMENTS, NUMBERS, SUPERVISION AND WORK PERFORMED. See table VII. 42. During the year the subordinate staff has increased from 148 to 156 and the strength of the establishment as it stood on March the 31st was as follows:(8) their districts is much to be regretted, and I cannot think that the wishes of the animal-owning population can be accurately represented, when we consider the yearly financial losses on account of cattle and other animal diseases. The maintenance of a special reserve staff of 15 head quarters veterinary assistants however has been a great help through the year in combating outbreaks of disease in those places where the district boards staff have been unable to deal with them. These men from being continually under the control and supervision of the superintendents, and in touch with the facilities at head quarters for improving their veterinary knowledge and methods, are proving to be of greatest assistance. By reason of their easy mobility they can in cases of emergency be rapidly equipped and despatched into the field at the seat of outbreaks to conduct inoculations or make other arrangements for the suppression of disease, or investigation of important matters. They have also been usefully employed during the year in other ways, such as the collection of morbid material for research purposes, the supervision of the department's cattle farm and horse stallion dépôt, the tracing of dangerous infected cases of dourine, glanders and surra and in the purchase of cattle, sheep and goats in connection with breeding operations. Some of the veterinary assistants under district boards, I regret to say, are inclined to slackness and a lack of discipline, owing to the inability of the boards to exercise the necessary control over them. EXPENDITURE OF THE DEPARTMENT. See table XIV A. 46. The cost of the department according to the statement furnished by the Accountant-General shows an increase, viz. Rs. 93,938 against Rs. 82,962 in the year. The increase under every head is due to the general expansion of the department, the chief being increase in staff, development of cattle, sheep and horse breeding operations, investigation experiments, &c, whilst the cost of inoculation serum being now borne by the provincial government, some expenditure has increased in this direction. GENERAL REMARKS. 47. I think that it will be admitted that in nearly every branch of the work of the Civil Veterinary department some substantial progress has been made this year. There is no doubt that it is steadily increasing in efficiency, while the scope of its opertions is rapidly extending. Every effort is being made to render the department of direct and practical use to the agricultural community, and from the testimony of these people, the stock owners themselves, it is obvious that their confidence is being gradually won, and that they are now realizing the benefits to be derived from veterinary help. This help is to be found not only in the individual treatment of their animals, but in the more rigid control of epizootics and in assistance and advice in breeding matters and the care and management of their livestock. One of the satisfactory features of the year's report has been a considerable decrease in the mortality from rinderpest and other diseases. This must of course, in a great measure, be attributed to auspicious seasonal and climatic conditions; at the same time the systematic efforts now made to immediately suppress all outbreaks, if possible, by inoculation and other methods must be given some consideration. Horse breeding operations continue to flourish and a great increase in mares covered has been recorded, while there is a greater demand than ever for district stallions. Undoubted progress has been made towards improve- ment in cattle breeding, and the issue of a substantial number of bulls from the cattle farm at Kheri is shortly expected, while the introduction of an annual batch of Hissar bulls for improving dairy cattle has already been commenced. Steps have been taken to ascertain if sheep breeding can be so improved as to make wool production a wider and more productive industry in these provinces than has hitherto been the case. Still however in some direction advancement is retarded by lack of funds, chiefly on the part of district boards and other local bodies, for the provision of a larger staff of veterinary assistants and the establishment of more hospitals and dispensaries. The present arrangements for the inspection of meat for human consumption are not as satisfactory as they could be, while some legislation for inspection and control of dairies and the production and clean handling of milk seems urgently called for.
(9) 48. For rendering genuine assistance in the work of inoculation three certificates have been awarded, viz. one each in the district of Shahjahanpur, Unao and Allahabad. A reward was also given by the Deputy Commissioner of Bahraich to a mukhia who helped the veterinary assistant of his district. Coronation Durbar certificates were also awarded to Sheikh Mumtaz-ud-din, stallion-keeper of Shekhupur, and Chaudhri Rafi-ud-din of Rajabpur, in recognition of the interest taken by them in fostering horse and mule-breeding operations. 49. I am indebted to Mr. C. W. Wilson, Second Superintendent, for the valuable assistance he has rendered me during an arduous year in the control of the department and investigation of disease, while the work performed by the subordinate staff has, during the year, on the whole been most satisfactory and deserves due credit.

No1423/XI-795 OF 1913. FROM THE HON'BLE Mr. H. R. C. HAILEY, I.C.S., DIRECTOR OF LAND RECORDS AND AGRICULTURE, UNITED PROVINCE, TO THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, UNITED PROVINCE, INDUSTRIES DEPARTMENT, NAINI TAL. Dated Lucknow, the 27th June 1913. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward the report on the administration of the Civil Veterinary department for the year ending 31st March 1913. 2. The difficulties of recruitment mentioned in last year's report continue to be experienced, and in spite of the co-operation of the officers of the Education department who kindly circularised the advantages of the service no larger number of candidates has been forthcoming. There appears to be a reluctance to go to another province for training, notwithstanding the offer of scholarships. The authorities of the Lahore Veterinary College have now limited the number of students who can be admitted to the college from these provinces to four and it will become increasingly difficult to fill the ranks of the service. 3. There were a number of serious outbreaks of cattle disease during the year, notably of rinderpest, which imposed a good deal of additional work on the staff. The total number of preventive inoculatious rose from 44,497 to 62,435, and those for rinderpest from 27,594 to 48,333. The results were generally reported to be satisfactory in checking the spread of the disease and there was a general readiness on the part of owners to have their animals inoculated. The existing staff is quite inadequate to deal with these frequent outbreaks; but, apart from the difficulty noted above of recruitment, there is an unwillingness, or possibly inability, on the part of the district boards to entertain a larger number of veterinary assistants. Some of the outbreaks of rinderpest have been traced to infected animals from fairs; and it may be found necessary to take steps for the closer supervision of cattle admitted to the larger fairs. 4. One branch of the work of the department which is being rapidly developed is cattle-breeding. The rising cost of cattle for agricultural purposes has brought the subject into prominence and stimulated the demand for bulls of the best draught breeds; while the numerous projects mooted for improving the milk-supply in large towns have led to enquiries regarding suitable milking cattle. The poor milk-giving qualities of the majority of the breeds of these provinces and the restricted cultivation and ignorance of the value of different fodder crops are likely to prove serious obstacles to the success of these projects. Partly with a view to assist this movement by providing a better class of milch cattle, and partly to provide bulls for breeding the heavier type of animals required in the western districts, a cattle farm is being opened in the Muttra district. The land acquired is commanded by the canal and this will permit of considerable areas being placed under fodder crops and their value for feeding purposes demonstrated. The Kheri farm, which is maintained for providing bulls of the Khairigarh and Parehar stock, is gradually being cleared and will shortly support a larger number of animals. The first issues have been made, mainly to Court of Wards estates, the demand from the local bodies and co-operative societies being principally for the larger breeds, such as the Hissar and Kosi. 5. The number of hospitals and dispensaries maintained by the district and municipal boards has increased considerably during the year and more use has been made of them by the public. Some divergence of practice exists with regard to the charging of a small fee at these institutions from wealthier owners. Where, however, it has been tried it has not been found to result in any material decrease in the number of patients, and in some instances it has brought in an
( 2 ) appreciable income to the local bodies. The fees charged are small and there appears no reason why persons who can afford to pay should obtain treatment of their animals free of charge. The practice, if regularly adopted, should enable the local bodies to devote more money to veterinary work. 6. The department has hitherto been hampered in its research work and the training of young assistants by the very inadequate accommodation at the Lucknow laboratory. Funds have now been allotted for a new building at Lucknow and its provision will greatly facilitate experimental and educational work at headquarters. 7. Mr. Wilson's report shows that the department is steadily growing in efficiency and usefulness and the public are showing their appreciation in a practical form by making larger demands on the services of its officers. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, H. R. C. HAILEY, Director.
(Maximum limit of report( 2 ) PAGES. TABLE NO. IX.Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, United Provinces, 1912-1913. 1. Administration report of the department for the year ending March the 31st, 1913, is herewith submitted. 2. Mr. E.W. Oliver held charge of the department up to February the 21st, 1913, when he proceeded on leave. He also carried out the duties of Second Superintendent in addition to his own work from April 19th to October 20th during the absence of Mr. C. W. Wilson on leave. Mr. C. W. Wilson carried out the duties of Second Superintendent from April the 1st to 18th and from October the 21st to the end of the year. He also officiated as Superintendent from February the 21st, 1913, to the end of the year in addition to his own duties. 3. Mr. Oliver was on tour for 133 days and travelled 555 miles by road and 18,268 miles by rail. He toured in twenty-one districts, supervising the work of the veterinary inspectors and the district board veterinary assistants. Nearly all the veterinary hospitals and dispensaries were visited and sites for the erection of others were selected, while a great deal of travelling was undertaken to inspect various stallion stands and stud bulls maintained by local bodies and others. It was often found necessary to visit and spend some time at the Moradabad stallion depôt for inspection and selection of sires for district work and constant supervision of the bull-rearing farm at Lakhimpur has entailed a great deal of travelling. Land for another cattle farm at Madhuri Kund in Muttra district has also been surveyed with the object of acquiring a suitable site for this purpose. Much touring has, as usual, been found necessary in connection with the Glanders, Farcy, Surra and Dourine Acts and in supervising sheep-breeding operations in various localities. Mr. Oliver personally attended and carried out investigation and research in twenty outbreaks of disease and wherever possible directed inoculations and treatment. He visited Bombay for the purchase of stallions and inspected various tonga lines in the provinces. During these tours district officers, landowners, managers of courts of wards, and others interested in agricul- tural stock were met and conferred with and meetings of committees dealing with the question of improving the conditions of dairy produce were attended and expert advice given. 4. Mr. C. W. Wilson was on tour for 82 days, during which time he toured in twenty-four districts and travelled 6,678 miles by rail and 350 miles by road. He inspected the majority of the hospitals and dispensaries in his circle, all the stallion stands and attended cattle fairs at Ballia, Dewa, Khairabad, Sardhwa, Atarra, Etawah, Hardoi, and Saharanpur, acting as judge or member of committee. He inspected stud bulls, the property of courts of wards and advised special managers regarding cattle-breeding and maintenance of stud animals. He personally attended outbreaks of cattle disease in 13 districts and supervised the inoculation work. A considerable amount of his time was spent in checking inoculation returns, specially in those districts where opposition to inoculation had previously been met with. He was deputed to select for district boards, court of wards, and private persons, stud bulls from the Hissar cattle farm. The sheep flocks in his circle were inspected and advice given to those in whose hands the care of the flocks is entrusted. He attended the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease at the Manjhra cattle farm and paid periodical visits of inspections. He personally accompanied the foot-and- mouth disease enquiry commission to village Manaura in the Jalaun district to demonstrate disease in situ and attended the examinations of final year students at Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore, as a member of the board of examiners. VETERINARY INSTRUCTION. 5. The veterinary colleges are now providing for their students a suitable training in inoculation, &c., and these men on first entering this department are furthermore, as opportunity occurs, deputed to districts under the supervision of an inspector where actual outbreaks of diseases exist in order that they may acquire a working knowledge of inoculation methods as conducted in the field. Hence
( 2 ) the deputation of new graduates to the Imperial Bacteriological laboratory, Muktesar, has now altogether been discontinued. A course of practical demonstration in pathology and bacteriology can be obtained now at the head- quarter laboratory in Lucknow by young veterinary assistants, and these men before being drafted to a district have acquired a knowledge of laboratory methods essential to those working in the field. 6. It is regrettable that, as mentioned in last year's report, the offer of scholarships still fails to attract suitable young men of these provinces to enter the veterinary profession, in spite of inducements held out to them to do so. The assis- tance of the Director of Public Instruction was solicited, however with no good result as very few candidates have been recruited. The reason for this, as previ- ously pointed out, seems to be the natural disinclination of the young men in these provinces towards any sort of practical work amongst domesticated animals. Last year it was suggested that if this state of things continued it would be advisable to throw open the scholarships to suitable men, residents of the Punjab and other allied provinces. His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor however was of opinion that no recourse should be made to this if it could be possibly avoided. The condition of things nevertheless remains as heretofore and after several years' trial the danger of the inadequate number of graduates for the department remains imminent. 7. Of the students sent to the Bengal Veterinary College two passed the final class examination and five out of six were successful in the final examination of the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore. The two remaining men at the Lahore college passed the first year examination. The student sent to Bombay Veterinary College passed the first year examination. The seven new graduates have joined the department and are now undergoing training. 8. A scientific association known as &quot;The United Provinces Veterinary Medical Society &quot; has recently been formed by the members of the subordinate staff of the department, which has for its main objects the advancement of veterinary science and interchange of professional ideas amongst its members. The issue of a vernacular scientific periodical in connection with the society has also been started and already possesses a large circulation. Awards and certificates for the best articles upon veterinary and other scientific subjects will be distributed. A Civil Veterinary Manual has now been compiled and is complete with rules for the guidance of district boards in regard to breeding and veterinary treatment of animals, in addition to directions for veterinary inspectors. Instruc- tions concerning inoculation, disinfection, collection and packing of material for diagnosis and investigation are given together with directions for care of Govern- ment stallions and copies of rules under the Glanders and Farcy, Dourine and Surra Acts are appended. The Manual has been submitted to Government for sanction. 9. A pamphlet dealing with &quot;Surra&quot; has been published and circulated amongst those people whom it is likely to interest and a monograph on rinderpest is now being compiled and will shortly be published. Mr. E. W. Oliver gave a series of lectures on meat inspection to recently appointed health officers, and veterinary inspecter Raza Husain conducted practical demonstrations on this subject in the slaughter-houses. Printed copies of these lectures were forwarded to the Sanitary Commissioner, United Provinces, and to the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, 2nd circle. TREATMENT OF DISEASE. See table II. 10. During the year under report 75,571 cases of contagious disease have been notified from practically all districts in the province with a reported mortality of 24,602. Rinderpest, as usual, has been the most serious and has accounted for 17,363 of the deaths reported. Although this might at first glance appear to be an excessive number, it is pointed out that with the increasing attention given to and facilities for ascertaining details and reporting outbreaks, many more now- a-days come to light than in past years, when it frequently happened that in a severe season hundreds of outbreaks occurred without being reported, but since these reports are submitted with much more system and regularity it is highly probable that only now approximately accurate estimates of the amount of con- tagious disease with its consequent annual mortality are being obtained.
( 3 ) EQUINE. 11. Equine contagious disease occurring in the four selected horse-breeding districts, Muzaffarnagar, Aligarh, Bulandshahr, and Meerut, is dealt with by the Army Remount department, while the Amy Veterinary Corps deals with the affected animals in the various branches of the Military department. The figures here only refer to cases brought directly under the notice of the Civil Veterinary department. 12. Glanders and Farcy.( 4 ) 21. Black quarter.( 5 ) OTHER DISEASES. See table IV. 27. The veterinary assistants visited 19,691 villages against 19,786 in the previous year and treated 45,687 animals for other contagious diseases than those already reported on. Although from this it would seem that this particular branch of work continues satisfactory, still the opinion is held that when contagious disease is not prevailing, these men could be more usefully employed at dispensaries, if more were established at headquarters, than in touring about the country looking for isolated cases to treat. At present, however, there are insufficient of these institutions, and until there is a substantial increase in the subordinate staff things must remain as they are. INVESTIGATION OF DISEASE. 28. During the year under report specimens of blood, morbid tissues, intestinal and other parasites have been submitted to the new laboratory at head- quarters by veterinary inspectors, assistants, and also from district authorities for bacteriological and pathological investigation and opinion. Examinations were made, the results have been noted and communicated to those persons interested. In connection with certain diseases experiments have been carried out and obser- vations made. Animals affected with various obscure diseases have also been sent for investigation but owing to lack of accommodation much useful material has had to be refused since there was no place to keep them in. The necessity for an experimental and research station at headquarters in connection with the laboratory already established has been previously pointed out and the inconve- nience which is experienced from the want of such. Owing to the development of the department and the increasing interest shown by the public in its endeavours to mitigate animal disease, it has become necessary to devote more attention than fomerly to that branch of work which includes research. Such diseases as kamri, barsati, akrah, dourine, pleuropneumonia of goats, fowl spirochaetesis, malignant jaundice (piroplasmosis) of the dog, as they occur in India, all call for more accurate knowledge, and at such a place at it is proposed to establish, work in this direction could be carried out with much benefit. Sanction has now been accorded for the erection of a suitable building in Lucknow. The important subject of surra has been further studied with the view of devising methods of prevention and to find an effective treatment. The arsenical treatment adopted by Major Holmes, Imperial Bacteriologist, has been applied with more or less satisfactory results. 29. Tuberculosis.( 6 ) Etawah. There is still further need for establishing more of these institutions as the superintendents are of opinion that every district headquarters and large tahsil should possess a hospital or dispensary according to its size and requirements. It is satisfactory and encouraging to record that the total number of cases treated during the year at hospitals and dispensaries was: out-patients 43,106 and in-patients 4,061, making a total of 47,167, an increase of 6,775 on last year's return. Some districts have introduced the system of charging a small scale of fees to those owners who can afford to pay, whilst others are as yet averse to the procedure. In those places where the system has been adopted and carried out in a businesslike way it has proved a success and has in no way affected the popularity of the hospitals. In Lucknow, the hospital has brought in an income of Rs. 2,593 during the year, and has had an average daily attendance of four new cases. BREEDING OPERATIONS. (1) BOVINES. (i) Stud bulls. See table VIII. 32. During the year there has been a great increase in the number of stud bulls maintained by the Civil Veterinary department, district boards, municipali- ties, courts of wards, and private estates, and stud animals are now maintained in 36 districts. The provision of adequate bull power appears to be giving a considerable impetus to the cattle-breeding industry, which year by year is arousing greater interest in the minds of the public of the province. The endeavours of the Civil Veterinary department have been directed towards the production of( 7 ) larger had more stallions been maintained by the Budaun District Board, as the two stallions standing there were stopped from covering, having completed their numbers. Three new stands have been opened: one at Bareilly under the municipal board, one in Kheri district, and an additional stand in the Budaun district. 37. Regarding the young stock, progeny of these provincial stallions, it is satisfactory to note the decided improvement and promise shown by them in many places particularly in the districts of Saharanpur, Moradabad, Budaun and Dehra Dun. Some exceptionally good young stock was noticed at the Saharanpur fair. The Arabs &quot;Bumblepuppy,&quot; &quot;Sardar,&quot; &quot;Copenhagen,&quot; and &quot;Brigand&quot; all of which are very popular with the breeders, have maintained their high standard and reputation as prime foal-getters. Requests for a stallion to be located in the Bareilly district, under control of the district board, are received, but so far the board has not provided funds for this purpose. 38. The functions of this department, in so far as horse-breeding is concerned, are confined to the improvement of the indigenous horse and pony for the general utility of the people in those tracts other than the four selected districts of Aligarh, Muzaffarnagar, Bulandshahr, and Meerut, and it is noticeable that these tracts which were primarily considered unsuitable for horse-breeding are now proving themselves capable of producing an animal which may be confidently expected to further improve. (ii) Donkey stallions. See tables X and XI. 39. At the beginning of the year there were 16 provincial donkeys on the register and as no purchases were made and no casualties happened, the balance at end of year remains the same. Of these donkeys 13, were at stud and the number of mares covered by them amounted to 592, which shows an increase of 85 on last year's figures. There appears to be still an increasing demand for the services of donkey stallions for mule-breeding; but, as was mentioned last year, the limited number available renders it difficult to meet the demand. It has been found impossible to obtain donkey stallions suitable for the purpose in India, therefore it may be mentioned again that it is essential to think about making some arrangements for importing them for future use if the mule-breeding industry is to be encouraged and sustained. SHEEP-BREEDING. 40. During the year under report operations have been started in this direction, as was proposed last year, with the object of ascertaining if there is any possibility of improving the quality and quantity of the wool of the Indian sheep. Experimental flocks have been formed and located at Aligarh, Moradabad, Bahraich, Kheri, Allahabad, Banda, Partabgarh, and Lucknow, and imported Merino rams introduced into the flocks. Already some 55 half-bred Merino lambs have been born but as yet it is too early to give any opinion in the matter. The ques- tion of sheep-breeding has been taken up at the Kapurthala State, the Partabgarh Courts of Wards Estates, the Jumna Mission Agricultural farm, and it is believed that some interest is being evoked in this most important subject which it is hoped will not be allowed to drop for want of continuity of policy or lack of funds. For this experiment 12 Merino rams were purchased, and during the year there were four casualties. FAIRS AND SHOWS. See table XIV. 41. Wherever possible these fairs and shows were attended by officers of the Civil Veterinary department, and Mr. Wilson was present and judged exhibits at the Dadri, Dewa, Khairabad, Etawah, Sardhua, Naraini, Hardoi, and Saharanpur fairs. The Deputy Superintendent was deputed to the Bulandshahr fair and veterinary inspectors to those within their respective circles. Temporary veteri- nary dispensaries were opened in connection with the Etawah, Bulandshahr, Saharanpur, and Batesar fairs under charge of district board or municipal veterinary assistants. Interesting specimens of drugs, instruments, &c., dealing with treatment of agricultural stock were on view at the Etawah Exhibition and demonstrations in inoculations and other methods were given. Rupees 1,401 were contributed towards prize awards and this amount was distributed at Saharanpur, Bulandshahr, Banda, and Ballia fairs.
( 8 ) SUBORDINATE ESTABLISHMENT( 9 ) health generally, and the efforts being made to render the department of direct practical use to the stock-owner are daily becoming more appreciated. Increased attention is being paid to the training of the staff and except in very few cases confidence in inoculation methods for the prevention of contagious diseases grows stronger year by year. Another satisfactory feature in the year's report is the decrease in numbers of outbreaks and deaths from surra. Horse-breeding steadily continues to make good progress and much attention is being directed towards improvements in cattle-breeding. The number of stud bulls now being annually issued is on the increase, and it should not be long before good results become apparent. Sheep breeding experiments have been started and give good promise. Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries are doing useful work and show an increasing yearly attendance as the demand for veterinary help expands. The success of the Kheri cattle farm has encouraged the department to put forward a scheme for another farm where bulls and buffaloes for the western districts will be stocked. If the work of the department goes on expanding at the same rate as it has done in the past five years it will be necessary before long to add to the superior staff the services of another Imperial Officer. 47. Ten sanads or certificates have been awarded to persons in the Allahabad, Ghazipur, Sultanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Budaun, and Cawnpore districts. 48. The work performed by the subordinate staff during the year has been on the whole satisfactory and deserves due credit. C. W.

No. 1476/XI-807 OF 1914. FROM THE HON'BLE Mr. H. E. C. HAILEY, I. C. S., DIRECTOR OF LAND RECORDS AND AGRICULTURE, UNITED PROVNCE, TO THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, UNITED PROVINCE, INDUSTRIES DEPARTMENT, NAINITAL. ;Dated Lucknow, the 30th June 1914. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward the report on the administration of the Civil Veterinary department for the year ending 31st March 1914. 2. The year was marked by serious outbreaks of disease, principally rinderpest, in different parts of the provinces, accompanied, in many cases, by high mortality among the cattle. These outbreaks unfortunately coincided with the practical stoppage of supplies of anti-rinderpest serum from the Mukhtesar Laboratory, which greatly handicapped the officers of the department in checking and localizing the disease. The demand for preventive inoculation on the part of cattle-owners afforded good evidence of the value of the work done in the past and the growing confidence in the efficacy of the treatment. It is noteworthy that the stock-owners in Bundelkhand(Maximum limit of report(ii) PAGES. TABLE NO. X.Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, United Provinces, 1913-14. 1. The administration report of the department for the year ending March the 31st, 1914, is herewith submitted. 2. I was on leave up to November the 3rd, 1913, on return from which I held the charge of the department throughout the rest of the year. Mr. C. W. Wilson, 2nd Superintendent, officiated as Superintendent during my absence in addition to his own duties. 3. I was on tour for 46 days, and travelled 219 miles by road and 9,858 miles by rail. I toured in 12 districts, where I made inspections of veterinary hospitals and dispensaries, district stallion stands, and other departmental institutions. Several visits were made to the stallion dépôt at Moradabad, the bull farm at Kheri, and the site for the new cattle farm which is being established at Muttra. Stud bulls, young equine and bovine stock were inspected, as well as the experimental flocks of sheep located in various parts of the province. As far as was possible, the work of veterinary assistants and inspectors was checked and supervised, and horse and cattle fairs attended. I inspected the ponies of the tonga lines, and the working bullocks in some of the important municipalities. Personal visits were made, and investigations carried out, in outbreaks of contagious disease, and where possible, preventive inoculations were supervised. I attended the All-India Agricultural Conference at Coimbatore and visited Bombay for the purchase of Arab stallions. 4. Mr. C. W. Wilson was on tour for 137 days, during which time he travelled 1,281 miles by road and 13,001 by rail. His tours ranged in 26 districts, where the work of the subordinate staff was supervised and checked, and the hospitals and dispensaries inspected. Most of the stallion stands were inspected by him as well stud bulls and sheep-breeding operations. He attended the cattle fairs at Khairabad, Fyzabad, and Hardoi, acting as judge and member of the committees. He examined the ponies of most of the tonga lines, and visited courts of wards and other estates to advise on the cattle-breeding question ; and in April was deputed to Lahore to act on the board of examiners at the Punjab Veterinary College. He personally attended 17 outbreaks of contagious equine and bovine disease, conducting research operations in connection therewith, and acted as member of the conference held at Etawah to deal with the question of cattle-grazing. 5. The Deputy Superintendent, M. Niaz Mohamad, was on tour for 137 days, during which time he visited 17 districts. He attended cattle shows and agricultural exhibitions at Dewa, Batesar, Aligarh, Etawah, Bulandshahr, and Saharanpur, and demonstrated veterinary methods to the stock-owners. He was deputed to the Naini Tal-Ranikhet road to deal with an outbreak of surra, and purchased cattle for the department in the Hissar district. He visited most of the stallion stands for the purpose of instructing the attendants in the correct methods of dealing with stallions, for stud work, and assisted the superintendents generally in inspections of veterinary hospitals, dispensaries, and the subordinate staff. It was necessary for him to spend some time at the cattle farms in connection with selection, branding, and registering of the animals. I.( 2 ) 7. The practice of deputing newly-joined veterinary assistants to the Imperial Laboratory at Muktesar has now been altogether discontinued, as the veterinary colleges provide suitable training for their students in inoculation methods. Moreover the facilities now at hand in the department itself for giving practical instruction to these men in the field has removed the necessity for their deputation to Muktesar for that purpose. Practical demonstration in pathology and bacteriology is now available at the head quarters laboratory in Lucknow, and the addition of a research station which is now in course of completion will afford young veterinary assistants still greater facilities for obtaining sound scientific experience. 8. Of the three students sent to the Bengal veterinary college, two passed the first year's examination and one failed. At the Punjab veterinary college the one who failed last year in the final examination and was allowed to continue his studies for another year has successfully passed this year. The two students in the 2nd-year class passed their examinations and were duly promoted to the final class, while the remaining two in the first-year class have been promoted to the 2nd-year class. The student at the Bombay veterinary college passed the 2nd-year examination and is promoted to the final class. 9. A Civil Veterinary Manual has now been published and is complete with rules for the guidance of district boards in regard to their responsibilities in connection with breeding of stock and the provision of veterinary treatment for animals. In addition to this, rules for veterinary inspectors are given, comprising instructions concerning inoculation, disinfection, collection, and packing of material for diagnosis and investigation, together with directions for care of Government stallions. Copies of rules for procedure under the Glanders and Farcy, Dourine and Surra Acts are appended. 10. A series of lectures and demonstrations in meat inspection was again this year delivered to the recently-appointed health officers of the Medical department. 11. A monograph on &quot;Glanders and Farcy&quot; has been compiled by me and is shortly expected from the press when it will be distributed to persons interested. Owing to numerous demands for the pamphlet on &quot;Rinderpest,&quot; it is now being translated into Urdu and Hindi and will shortly be issued. 12. The United Provinces Veterinary Medical Society, which was started in 1912 by the members of the civil veterinary staff, appears to be doing good work, and is greatly to be encouraged as a means of keeping the members up to date in their scientific knowledge, and promoting an interchange of professional ideas. The society has obtained a magic lantern and slides dealing with veterinary subjects and those connected with live-stock generally. It is proposed to periodically give illustrated demonstrations to cultivators and others, in the agricultural and stock-rearing tracts.

Notification of anthrax cases is regularly given to the American Consul. 26. Foot-and-mouth disease.( 5 ) Other diseases. See table IV. 30. The veterinary assistants have this year visited 22,590 villages against 19,691 in the previous year and have treated 90,067 animals for diseases other than those already reported on. Investigation of disease. 31. During the year the work of the laboratory has much increased, and a great number of specimens of blood, morbid tissues, intestinal parasites, and other material have been received from the district veterinary staff, veterinary inspectors, district officers, and private persons for examination and opinion. In these cases the results are noted and, where possible, the diagnosis confirmed and the persons interested accordingly informed. Certain investigations have been carried out in the slaughter-houses and dried meat factories of these provinces, but owing to the present somewhat inefficient control of the butchering trades, it is difficult to obtain the material and assistance which should be available to this department to pursue its investigations. At the request of the Australian Government Entomologist an enquiry was made into the prevalence of &quot; Onchocerca Gibsoni &quot; or Worm Nodules in the cattle of this country. The necessary information and specimens were obtained and forwarded to the officer in question. Virulent rinderpest blood and other morbid material was collected during the year for the Imperial Bacteriologist for experimental and other purposes. Some continued enquiries have been made in regard to cattle tuberculosis, spirochetosis in fowls, and kamri, and experiments have been carried out in the preventive and curative treatment of distemper by vaccine treatment. 32. A new experimental station for the accommodation of animals under scientific observation, is in course of construction and will be shortly opened. With these increased facilities it is hoped that not only we shall be able to do more towards the elucidation of obscure diseases, but it will afford also the younger members of the staff more opportunity for observation and study of methods of research. The institution will be furnished with a lethal chamber for the quick and painless destruction of dogs, in addition to other up-to-date equipment. Much still remains to be done in connection with investigation of disease, but up to now, on account of the very large area of the Superintendents' charges and the rapidly-increasing amount of work in connection with inspection and general administration of the department, it has not been possible to devote as much personal attention to this important branch of work, as it really demands. It is however hoped that before long some increase in the superior staff will be sanctioned. All veterinary assistants in charge of veterinary hospitals are now being furnished with instruments for removing the brains of dogs suspected of rabies, and have been instructed in the methods of preparing and despatching the same to the Pasteur institute for examination. Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. See table V. 33. There are now 49 hospitals or dispensaries in the provinces as against 46 of last year, being an increase of 3; those at Baraut, Amroha, and Partabgarh having been opened during the year. Others are about to be established at Rurki, Kairana and Jansath, Hathras and Kasganj and the question of new premises for the present hospital in Moradabad is now under consideration. There has been an increase in the number of patients treated, viz. 4,714 in-patients and 51,753 out-patients against 4,061 in-patients and 43,106 out-patients for 1912-13. These institutions continue to do excellent work and it is to be regretted that there are not more of them. The system of charging a small scale of fees has now been adopted and is meeting with considerable success at Lucknow, Cawnpore, Agra, Dehra Dun, and Jhansi. It has been found to work well and in some cases so much income is realized as to render them practically self-supporting while other smaller institutions earn a not inconsiderable sum towards their expenses. It is much to be regretted that at certain district head quarters veterinary hospitals although urgently required have not yet been provided. Amongst these Allahabad, Naini Tal, Mussooree, Mirzapur, Hamirpur, and Jalaun might be mentioned.
( 6 ) A veterinary dispensary at Bikapur, district Fyzabad, has lately been established by private subscription. Applications have also been received from the inhabitants of certain other places asking for the provision of such institutions. This, I think, clearly dispels any idea that these places are not keenly appreciated by the people. A travelling dispensary at Etawah has been started last year and is working satisfactorily. III.( 7 ) erection of the buildings, &c., the farm has already been partly stocked with 76 animals and it is hoped that the first batch of bulls of the Hissar breed, and superior buffalo bulls will be ready to be issued at the end of 1916 as provided for in the sanctioned scheme. (2) EQUINE (UNDER LOCAL BODIES). (i) Horse and pony stallions. See table X. 37. At the commencement of the year there were 57 horse and pony stallions at stud belonging to this department. 38. Five stallions were purchased during the year. One was castrated and sold as it was considered unfit for further stud work. One died from enteritis and one was destroyed as suffering from rabies, thus leaving a balance of 59 on the list at the end of the year. See table XI. 39. Fifty-one stallions were at stud work during the year and the number of mares covered by these stallions amounted to 3,003, which is again a very satisfactory increase of 244 on the previous year's coverings. One new stand has been opened at Tamkohi, district Gorakhpur. 40. Regarding young stock, the progeny of these provincial stallions, there is a continued improvement and promise shown by them in many parts particularly in the districts of Saharanpur, Moradabad, and Budaun. Some excellent colts and fillies have been seen at the Saharanpur fair, the progeny of &quot;Achilles,&quot; &quot;Oberon,&quot; and &quot; Nelson, &quot; Arab stallions. 41. As I mentioned last year, the functions of this department in so far as horse-breeding is concerned, are confined to the improvement of the indigenous horse and pony from a point of general utility, in those tracts other than the four selected districts of Aligarh, Muzaffarnagar, Bulandshahr, and Meerut. The Royal Horse-Breeding Commission, in their report of 1900-01, considered that these unselected tracts were not suitable for the production of horses up to the standard required, as remounts. Here I am in agreement with them, but although also personally doubtful of the possibility of breeding horses up to that grade, it is evident that these localities are now proving themselves capable of producing much better animals than formerly. (ii) Donkey stallions. See tables X and XI. 42. At the beginning of the year there were 16 provincial donkeys on the register and 4 were since purchased from the Hissar cattle farm. Of these, 14 were at stud, and the number of mares covered by them amounted to 709, which shows an increase of 117 on last year's figures. There appears to be still an increasing demand for the services of donkey stallions for mule-breeding, but as was mentioned last year, the limited number available renders it difficult to meet the demand. The Hissar jacks have not proved very successful, and as the price of them has been considerably increased, it is not considered worthwhile continuing to purchase them. Some arrangements for importing these sires seem imperative if the mule-breeding industry is to be encouraged as it deserves. 43. A piece of land adjoining the stallion dépôt at Moradabad has been acquired for the extension of the premises, and is found to be of great use for the safe exercising of the horses. Sheep-breeding. 44. The results of sheep-breeding experiments recently undertaken by this department with a view to ascertain how far it is possible to improve the quality and quantity of the wool of the indigenous sheep have up to the present proved very encouraging and satisfactory. The introduction of the merino strain has been found to have a very beneficial effect on both the quality and the quantity of the fleeces. It being primarily of importance to find out in what parts of the province, the climate and other conditions would be favourable to wool-growing, flocks of young ewes indigenous to the tract in which they are located have been formed, and are now distributed at the following places :( 8 ) favourably on the fleece. Some difficulty is experienced in acclimatizing the pure merino stock and the mortality is somewhat high. The half-bred progeny however seem to do well and when we have obtained sufficient of these, the future lines of experiment will be directed towards endeavouring to fix a type of sheep with the superior wool-producing capacity of the merino, but which will be able to stand the vicissitudes of the Indian climate. Fairs and shows. See table XIV. 45. I personally attended the Etawah and Nauchandi fairs and Mr. Wilson was present and judged at those held at Hardoi, Fyzabad, and Khairabad. The Deputy Superintendant visited the fairs and shows at Aligarh, Saharanpur, Bulandshahr, Etawah, Dewa, and Batesar for rendering assistance in the cattle judging, and giving demonstrations to the stock-owners in general management, and first aid in cases of emergency or disease. One thousand rupees were contributed by the department to various shows for prizes for the best specimens of bovine stock. It is somewhat doubtful if the system of distributing money in the form of prizes for cattle at fairs and shows is productive of much improvement in the local stock. A scheme is being drawn up with a view to distributing prizes locally in those areas chiefly where Government stud bulls are located for the best stock got by them. It is hoped by this means to encourage the breeder to look ahead and breed up to a higher standard than he has formerly done. IV.( 9 ) of opinion that the standard of efficiency is not up to that of the provincial staff. Some reason for this may be found in the fact that they are not subject to the same discipline as these officers; they are the servants of the district boards or those bodies which actually pay them and as such they can often evade compliance with the wishes of the superintendent in technical matters which would not be easy to do if they were directly under the administrative and technical control of the civil veterinary department officers. It is beginning to be generally realized that in those places where there is no hospital the practice of locating of a veterinary assistant in a suitable dispensary with a small supply of drugs and instruments at his disposal, is productive of more good work than if he is touring around an enormous area of country, in which case his work is bound to be more or less sketchy, and his work and movements very difficult to control. When stationed at a dispensary the neighbouring animal owners usually know where they can find him, and will bring their animals for treatment if necessary. In outbreaks of contagious disease he is expected to temporarily shut his dispensary and proceed to the seat of disease.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE Civil Veterinary Department, UNITED PROVINCES, FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31ST MARCH 1915. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] ALLAHABAD: PRINTED BY F. LUKER, SUPDT., GOVERNMENT PRESS, UNITED PROVINCES. 1915.
No. 1587/XI-840 FROM THE HON'BLE MR. H. R. C. HAILEY, I. C. S., DIRECTOR OF LAND RECORDS AND AGRICULTURE, UNITED PROVINCES, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, UNITED PROVINCES, INDUSTRIES DEPARTMENT, NAINI TAL. Dated Lucknow, the 29th June 1915. SIR, I have the honour to forward the report on the administration of the Civil Veterinary department for the year ending 31st March 1915. With a full supply of serum available the number of inoculations for rinderpest increased from 54,937 to 74,050. The number of animals treated in the veterinary hospitals rose from 56,467 to 67,802. While these increases are satisfactory and indicate growing confidence on the part of owners of stock, it is necessary for full benefit to be derived from the heavy expenditure by Government on preventive inoculation that closer control should be exercised by the Civil Veterinary department over the district staff. The same applies equally to the veterinary hospitals. The work in both branches is highly technical and should adequately be supervised by officers with the necessary training and knowledge. The matter is under discussion with the district boards. 2. The development of the operations of the department, which is clearly set out in the report, will in future necessitate some changes in its organization. It is proposed to divide the provinces into three circles with subordinate sub-circles of which there will be a Superintendent or Deputy Superintendent in charge. This will enable the superior officers of the department to supervise more effectually district work and will bring them in closer touch with owners and breeders of stock. It is hoped to bring part of the new scheme in force during the current year. 3. The new research laboratory at Lucknow was opened during the year under report. It will supply a much felt need in providing a central station for the investigation of animal disease and for giving additional training to the junior members of the staff. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, H. R. C. HAILEY, Director.
(Maximum limit of report(ii) Pages. TABLE No. VIII.Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary department, United Provinces, 1914-15. 1. The administration report of the department for the year ending March 31st, 1915, is herewith submitted. 2. I held charge of the department throughout the year and Mr. C. W. Wilson carried out the duties of second Superintendent. 3. I was on tour for 133 days and travelled 17,352 miles by rail and 686 by road. I visited 22 districts, making inspections of veterinary hospitals and dispensaries, district stallion stands and cattle-breeding centres, as well as other departmental institutions. It was necessary to pay many visits to the stallion d6p6t at Moradabad, the bull run at Kheri, and to the new cattle farm under construction in the Muttra district. Stud bulls, young equine and bovine stock were inspected and the experimental flocks of sheep located in various parts of the province necessitated a good deal of attendance. I visited the co-operative credit dairies at Lucknow and Benares and gave advice as to their management. Wherever possible the work of veterinary inspectors and assistants was supervised and checked, and horse and cattle fairs attended. I inspected the ponies of the tonga lines and the working bullocks in some of the important municipalities. Personal visits were made and investigations carried out in outbreaks of contagious disease, and wherever possible preventive inoculation was introduced. I spent four days at Bombay for the purchase of stallions and visited Calcutta to see the Raymond research station, and to consult the Principal of the veterinary college with regard to the stipendiary students. 4. Mr. C. W. Wilson was on tour 115 days, during which time he travelled by rail 8,266 miles and 1,719 miles by road. His tours ranged in 24 districts, where veterinary hospitals and dispensaries were inspected and the work of the subordinate staff checked. Where outbreaks of cattle disease occurred inoculation work was supervised. All the stallion stands in his circle except one in the Gorakhpur district were visited as were also the stud bulls maintained by district boards and other bodies; the experimental sheep flocks were also regularly seen. He attended the Manjhra cattle farm at Lakhimpur on several occasions to select bulls for district boards and court of wards estates, and for investigation of certain parasitic diseases which where causing some mortality amongst the sheep and lambs. He judged the cattle and horses at the annual exhibition held at Hardoi, and at the Khairabad fair and was deputed to Lahore to act as an examiner at the Punjab veterinary college. He inspected the Dehra Dun-Chakrata tonga line and personally conducted inoculation campaigns against rinderpest in the Gorakhpur and Lucknow districts. Visits were made to check the inoculation work performed in the Lalitpur, Jhansi, Gorakhpur and Lucknow districts, and glanders cases were dealt with in Allahabad, Naini Tal and Basti. He attended Cawnpore to purchase buffaloes for the Government cattle farm, and visited court of wards estates regarding sheep and cattle breeding. Sites were inspected for hospitals at Bikapur, Bara Banki, Misrikh and Sidhauli. 5. M. Niaz Muhammad, Deputy Superintendent, was on tour for 208 days and travelled 7,548 miles by rail and 1,415 by road. He visited 17 districts, during this time making inspections of the subordinate staff and organising campaigns against animal contagious disease. He attended the cattle shows and agricultural exhibitions at Batesar, Aligarh, Bulandshahr, Meerut, &c., and demonstrated veterinary methods to the stock owners. He spent some time on the Kathgodam-Ranikhet road and also on the Chakrata dâk lines to deal with outbreaks of surra and glanders. Tours were made through nearly all the horse-breeding tracts for the purpose of supervision of horse-breeding operations, inspection of the stud animals and checking the covering returns. He assisted the Superintendents generally in inspections of veterinary hospitals, dispensaries and the subordinate staff and attended the department's cattle farms and dépôts in connection with the selection, branding and registering of the animals, meanwhile giving practical instruction to the attendants.
(2) 6. Mr. T. S. Davies, probationary Deputy Superintendent, was 22 days on tour and travelled 1,727 miles by rail and 187 miles by road. His tours, which were chiefly in connection with outbreaks of animal epidemics, inspection of the department's farms, dépôt, &c., were made with a view to gaining practical experience of the work. He, however, assisted Superintendents in checking the tours of itinerating veterinary assistants and the work carried out at hospitals and dispensaries. I.(3) II.(4) decrease in the number of animals which have annually succumbed during the past few years. Five hundred and sixteen cattle were immunized by the vaccine method and 3,228 were inoculated with generally satisfactory results. 27. Black quarter.(5) Investigation of disease. 34. During the past year the work at the headquarters laboratory has continued to increase very considerably and a great number of specimens of blood, morbid tissues, intestinal parasites and other material have been received from the district veterinary staff, veterinary inspectors, district officers, and private persons for examination and opinion. In these cases the results are noted and, where possible, the diagnosis confirmed, and the persons interested accordingly informed. Investigations have been carried out in the slaughter-houses and the Burma dried meat factories of these provinces. A separate report on the subject is being submitted with proposals for putting the butchering trades under more efficient control. At the request of the Australian Government Entomologist further enquiry was made into the prevalence of &quot;Onchocerca Gibsoni&quot; or Worm Nodules' in the cattle of this country. The necessary information and specimens were obtained and forwarded to the officer in question. Virulent rinderpest blood and other morbid material was collected during the year for the Imperial Bacteriologist for experimental and other purposes. Some continued enquiries have been made in regard to cattle tuberculosis, spirochetosis in fowls and kamri, and experiments have been carried out in the preventive and curative treatment of distemper by vaccine treatment. 35. The new research station for accommodation of animals under scientific observation has recently been completed and was formally opened by His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor in November last. Already it has proved of great use and many interesting cases have been received. Since its opening a number of experiments have been carried on in connection with certain diseases, such as barsati, akrah, ardaha, dourine, pleuropneumonia of goats, fowl spirochetosis, malignant jaundice (piroplasmosis). With these increased facilities it is hoped that not only we shall be able to do more towards the elucidation of obscure diseases but the younger members of the staff will have more opportunity for observation and study of methods of research. Several animals suffering from &quot;kamri&quot; have been received for treatment and observation and experiments have been carried out with a view of discovering the cause of the disease and a remedy for it. In some tracts considerable loss to horse owners annually results from the ravages of this malady, which up to the present appears to have defied efforts at curative treatment. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary department, would be glad of any cases for investigation if owners would inform him when an outbreak or even a single case occurs. Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. See table V. 36. There are now 61 hospitals or dispensaries in the provinces as against 49 of last year, being an increase of 12; those at Jansath, Ghaziabad, Shikohabad, Kheragarh, Fatehabad, Khair, Hathras, Atrauli, Dataganj, Deoria, Sidhauli and Misrikh having been opened during the year. Others are about to be established at Kairana, Allahabad, Phulpur, Karchana, Roorkee, Kasganj, Tilhar, Jalaun, Mohanlalganj, Malihabad, Bikapur and the question of new premises for the present hospital in Moradabad is still under consideration. It is satisfactory and encouraging to record that the total number of cases treated during the year at hospitals and dispensaries was: out-patients 62,040 and in-patients 5,762, making a total of 67,802; an increase of 11,335 on last year's return. Some districts have introduced the system of charging a small scale of fees to those owners who can afford to pay, whilst others are as yet averse to the procedure. It has now been adopted and is meeting with considerable success at Lucknow, Cawnpore, Agra, Dehra Dun and Jhansi, where it has been found to work well, and in some cases so much income is realized as to render the institution practically self-supporting, while other smaller dispensaries earn a not inconsiderable sum towards their expenses. The animals of all poor persons are treated gratis, and only those in a position to pay are charged. I think this system might be introduced at several other hospitals, as I do not anticipate that the levy of fees would in any way affect the attendance at the institutions. A travelling veterinary dispensary has been started in the Etawah district but it is too early yet to predict what success it is likely to meet with.
(6) III.(7) (2) EQUINE (UNDER LOCAL BODIES). (i) Horse and pony stallions. See table X. 40. At the commencement of the year there were 59 horse and pony stallions at stud belonging to this department. 41. Eight stallions were purchased during the year. One was castrated and sold as it was considered unfit for further stud work, and two died(8) services of an experienced and practical Australian shepherd well acquainted with the management of flocks and the correct methods of shearing and the handling of fleeces, who will be able to impart practical knowledge to the Indian breeders. Fairs and shows. See table XIV. 47. I personally attended and judged the cattle and other animals at the Bulandshahr and Deva cattle shows and Mr. Wilson was present and judged at the agricultural exhibitions and fairs held at Hardoi and Khairabad. Maulvi Niaz Muhammad, Deputy Superintendent, attended the fairs and agricultural exhibitions held at Etawah, Aligarh, Nauchandi and Batesar, where he also conducted an exhibition of the latest Veterinary instruments and remedies, and gave magic lantern demonstrations on animal subjects to the cultivators attending the fairs. It is somewhat doubtful if the system of distributing money in the form of prizes for cattle at fairs and shows is productive of as much improvement in the local stock as would be expected. A scheme is being drawn up with a view to distributing prizes locally in those areas chiefly where Government stud bulls are located for the best stock got by them. It is hoped by this means to encourage the breeder to look ahead and breed up to a higher standard than he has formerly done. IV.( 9 ) 51.

No. 1750/x1-865 of 1916. FROM THE HON'BLE MR. H. R. C. HAILEY, C. I. E., I. C. S., DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF LAND RECORDS AND AGRICULTURE, UNITED PROVINCES, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, UNITED PROVINCES, INDUSTRIES DEPARTMENT, NAINI TAL. Dated Lucknow, the 7th July, 1916. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward the report on the administration of the Civil Veterinary department for the year ending 31st March, 1916. 2. The work of the Civil Veterinary department falls under two main heads(Maximum limit of report( ii ) Pages. TABLE NO. VII.Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary department, United Provinces, 1915-16. 1. The administration report of the department for the year ending March 31st, 1916, is herewith submitted. 2. Owing to the development of the department, and the extension of its operations it has been necessary to make some changes in its organisation. There will eventually be three circles in the provinces each in charge of a Superintendent, with three subordinate sub-divisions under the supervision of Deputy Superintendents. Up to the present owing to the war a third Superintendent has not been appointed, but two circles with headquarters at Luclnow and Meerut respectively have been formed with sub-divisional offices at Bareilly and Allahabad. 3. I held charge of the department throughout the year and Mr. C. W. Wilson carried out the duties of second Superintendent. Tours of officers. 4. I was on tour for 121 days, and travelled 16,315 miles by rail and 1,253 by road. I visited 20 districts, during which time inspections were made of the veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. District stallion stands and horse, sheep and cattle-breeding tracts were also visited. The departmental cattle farms at Muttra and Kheri, also the stallion dépôt at Moradabad necessitated frequent attendance by me during the year, and the stud bulls, the young equine and bovine stock and the various experimental flocks of sheep were all periodically inspected. Visits were made to the co-operative credit dairies at Lucknow and Benares and advice as to the management and feeding of the stock was given When possible the offices of the Deputy Superintendents have been inspected, and the work of veterinary inspectors and assistants supervised and checked. Agricultural exhibitions, horse and cattle fairs were attended and tours were made over the principal tonga lines for examination of the ponies. Personal visits were made and investigation was carried out in 17 outbreaks of contagious disease. I visited Bombay for the purchase of stallions and to supervise the landing of the recently imported English cattle, and attended Amritsar fair for the purchase of cattle and buffaloes. 5. Mr. C. W. Wilson toured for 116 days during which time he travelled 9,717 miles by rail and 696 by road. His tours ranged in 28 districts where the work of the subordinate staff was checked and veterinary hospitals and dispensaries inspected. He visited most of the stallion stands in his circle as well as the stud bulls maintained by districts. He attended the annual exhibitions and fairs at Etawah, Bulandshahr, Muzaffarnagar and Saharanpur and inspected the tonga lines in his circle. Where outbreaks of cattle disease occurred inoculations were supervised. He attended the Agricultural Conference held in Pusa and was deputed to Lahore to act on the board of examiners at the Punjab Veterinary College. 6. M. Niaz Muhammad, Deputy Superintendent, Bareilly sub-division, was on tour for 126 days during which time he travelled 6,258 miles by rail and 570 by road. His time was employed chiefly in inspection of veterinary hospitals and dispensaries and supervision of the inspectors and veterinary assistants. He visited the Moradabad dépôt and the stallion and bull stands of his division where he inspected and checked the young stock. Outbreaks of contagious disease were investigated and he attended the agricultural exhibitions at Tigri (Moradabad). Budaun, Aligarh. Saharanpur and Meerut. 7. Mr. T. S. Davies, Deputy Superintendent, Allahabad sub-division, was 106 days on tour and travelled 7,986 miles by rail and 425 by road. His tours mainly consisted of inspections of hospitals and dispensaries and supervision of Government stud animals. He attended outbreaks of contagious disease and checked the work of veterinary inspectors and assistants. 8. S. M. Baza Husain, who was recently appointed as third Deputy Superintendent, travelled 1,122 miles by rail and 113 by road. He was employed chiefly in connection with the recently introduced cattle-breeding scheme and
( 2 ) attended the two cattle farms for the selection and issue of bulls and supervision of agricultural operations. He also toured through the tracts where sheep- breeding operations are in progress. I.( 3 ) 19. Strangles.( 4 ) In addition to this they have castrated 842 animals and attended 38,613 cases of contagious diseases exclusive of those animals treated in hospitals and dispensaries. Investigation of disease. 31. During the year under report many interesting specimens of blood, morbid tissues, intestinal and other parasites have been submitted to the laboratory at headquarters by veterinary inspectors and assistants and also from district authorities for bacteriologioal and pathological examination: Examinations have been made and the results have been noted and communicated to those persons concerned. Satisfactory work has also been carried out at the experimental and Research station at Badshahbagh. Investigations were conducted in connection with kamri, pleuro-pneumonia in sheep and goats, gillar barsati, akrah, fowl-cholera, piroplasmasis, etc. A series of experiments to determine the most economical and effective form of drug treatment for the numerous internal and external parasites of sheep and cattle are also being carried out. At the request of the Imperial Entomologist, Pusa, certain forms of parasites have been collected and sent to him for investigation. The prophylactic and curative effects of distemper vaccines and pneumonia phylacogen have been tested. An enquiry into the methods adopted in the Burma Meat Trade has been completed and proposals for more efficient management have been submitted. Rules. are being framed in consultation with the district boards concerned for the proper sanitary control of this industry. Cattle poisoning.( 5 ) Bull-rearing and breeding farms and dépôts. See table IX. 34. Kheri cattle farm.( 6 ) (2) EQUINE (UNDER LOCAL BODIES). (i) Horse and pony stallions. See table X. 38. At the commencement of the year there were 63 horse and pony stallions at stud belonging to this department. 39. Five stallions were purchased during the year. Two were castrated and sold as they were unfit for further stud work and one died of snake bite, thus leaving a balance of 65 on the list at the end of the year. See table XI. 40. Fifty-three sires were at stud work during the year, and the number of mares covered by them amounted to 3,331 or 385 in excess of last year which is very satisfactory, despite the fact that on account of the demand for horses as the result of the war and the increase in the mounted police, many mares have been disposed of in certain districts. 41. Regarding the young stock the progeny of these provincial stallions it is satisfactory to note the decided improvement and promise shown by them in many places particularly in the districts of Saharanpur, Budaun, Moradabad and Shahjahanpur. Some exceptionally good young stock was noticed at the Saharanpur, Budaun and Tigri fairs. The Arabs " Copenhagen," " Achilles," " Akbar," " Bantun II," " Nelson," " Hermit " and " Paragon,'' all of which are very popular with the breeders, have maintained their high standard and reputation as foal getters. 42. The functions of this department, in so far as horse breeding is concerned, are confined to the improvement of the indigenous horse and pony for general utility purposes in those tracts other than the four selected districts of Aligarh, Muzaffarnagar, Bulandshahr and Meerut, and it is noticeable that these tracts which were primarily considered unsuitable for horse breeding are now proving themselves capable of producing a type of animal, which may be confidently expected to still further improve. As year by year we have been gradually replacing the old stallions (some of which were somewhat small) by young strong sires of 14-1 hands and over, there has now arisen a noticeable increase in the demand for them ; at the same time I regret that in some localities, although the breeders have represented the necessity for more facilities for horse breeding, district boards have been unable to meet their wishes from want of funds to defray the cost of maintenance. On account of the great demand for equine stock, as the result of the present war, it is highly probable that there will be some scarcity of horses, ponies and mules for some time to come, and it is obvious that all young stock will fetch greatly enhanced prices. I would again like to point out then the necessity for all district boards, local bodies, Court of Wards, etc, to endeavour to provide for the location of stallions within their areas, and give encouragement to horse breeding generally. (ii) Donkey stallions. See tables X and XI. 43. At the beginning of the year there were 20 provincial donkeys on the register and three were since purchased. Three have died and one destroyed leaving a balance of 19. Of these, 16 were at stud and the number of mares covered by them amounted to 820, which shows an increase of 34 on last year's figures. There appears to be still an increasing demand for the services of donkey stallions for mule breeding, but as was mentioned last year, the limited number available renders it difficult to meet the demand. One Hissar bred jack. however, has been purchased this year and two American donkey stallions have been obtained from the Army Remount Department. Sheep-breeding. 44. The problem of improving the wool-growing industry in India viewed from the economic aspect, is still engaging the attention of the department. A preliminary note on the subject giving the details and results of the experiments which already have been carried out was submitted last year and a proposal was drawn up for the establishment of a sheep-breeding demonstration farm. Owing to lack of funds, however, this scheme was dropped. During the year under report continued experiments in the grading up of the country sheep have been made with satisfactory results.
( 7 ) 45. As the great distances and difficult conditions make it impracticable to arrange for any responsible supervising agency to carry on breeding experiments in the Himalayan breeding grounds our field of operations is at present confined to the plains. Here a great deal of useful information has been obtained and further experiments are being conducted in the parts which are especially favourable to sheep. 46. Half and three-quarter bred merino-country rams have been distributed in many districts to Court of Wards Estates and others and the reports concerning their progeny have been distinctly encouraging. Fairs and shows. See table XIV. 47. I personally attended and judged the cattle and other animals at the Hardoi agricultural exhibition and Mr. Wilson, 2nd Superintendent, was present at the agricultural exhibitions and fairs held at Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Bulandshahr and Etawah. M. Niaz Muhammad, 1st Deputy Superintendent, attended the cattle fairs held at Tigri, Budaun, Aligarb, Nauchandi and Saharanpur where the latest veterinary instruments and remedies were exhibited. He also gave magic lantern demonstrations on animal subjects to the cultivators attending the fair. Mr. T. S. Davies, 2nd Deputy Superintendent attended the Khairabad show and S. M. Raza Husain, 3rd Deputy Superintendent, attended the Hardoi district exhibition.

No. 1656/XI(Maximum limit of report( 2 ) TABLE No. VIII.Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary department, United Provinces, 1916-17. 1. The administration report of the department for the year ending the 31st March, 1917, is herewith submitted. 2. Mr. E. W. Oliver held charge of the department up to the 27th October, 1916, when he proceeded on combined leave. He also carried out the duties of the second Superintendent in addition to his own work from the 17th April to the 16th July, 1916, during the absence of Mr. C. W. Wilson on leave, and from the 1st to the 18th August, 1916, the period when there was no second Superintendent conse- quent on the transfer of Mr. Wilson to the Central Provinces. 3. Mr. C. W. Wilson carried out the duties of second Superintendent from the 1st to the 16th April, 1916, when he proceeded on three months' privilege leave and from the 17th to the 31st July, 1916, after which he went to the Central Pro- vinces on transfer as Superintendent. 4. I took over charge of the duties of second Superintendent from the 19th August, 1916, on my transfer from the Central Provinces. Prom the 28th October, 1916, I have held charge of the duties of the Superintendent to the end of the year in addition to my own. Tours of officers. 5. Mr. E. W. Oliver was 99 days on tour and travelled 785 miles by road and 10,703 miles by rail. He toured in 10 districts inspecting the veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. His attendance was necessary at the stallion depot at Moradabad and the Muttra and Kheri cattle farms on several occasions. He visited Amritsar and Bombay for the purchase of cattle and Arab stallions, respectively, and went to Simla to see the English bull located at Tara Devi. He attended the cattle fair at Dewa, district Bara Banki. He personally attended six outbreaks of contagious disease and, where necessary, directed inoculation operations. 6. Mr. C. W. Wilson was on tour for 18 days during which time he travelled 14 miles by road and 900 miles by rail. He inspected the English cattle at Rajpur, district Dehra Dun, and was deputed to Lahore on the Board of Examiners at the Punjab Veterinary College. 7. I was on tour for 155 days and travelled 1,331 miles by road and 8,445 miles by rail. I toured in 30 districts inspecting the existing veterinary hospitals and dispensaries and selecting suitable sites for the establishment of others. Most of the district stallion stands were visited and stud bulls where maintained were inspected. Several visits were made to the stallion depot at Moradabad and the Muttra and Kheri cattle farms. As far as possible, the work of veterinary assistants and inspectors was checked and supervised and horse and cattle fairs attended. Personal visits were made and investigations carried out in outbreaks of contagious diseases, amongst equines and bovines and, where possible, preventive inoculations and precautionary measures were supervised. 8. Munshi Niaz Muhammad, Deputy Superintendent, Bareilly sub-division, was in charge of that sub-division up to January 15, 1917, after which date his headquarters were transferred to Meerut temporarily for the period Mr. Oliver is on leave. He was on tour for 278 days during which time he travelled 11,159 miles by rail and 871 miles by road. He visited 14 districts, checked and supervised the work of the subordinate staff and attended glanders and farcy cases. He also visited most of the bull and stallion stands for the purpose of instructing the attendants in correct methods of dealing with these animals for stud purposes. He attended the cattle and horse shows and agricultural exhibitions at Budaun, Etawah, Moradabad, Aligarh, Bulandshahr, Meerut, and Muzaffarnagar. He was deputed to Dehra Dun and Mussoorie to check the outbreaks amongst English cattle. 9. Mr. T. S. Davies, Deputy Superintendent, was in charge of the Allahabad sub-division up to the 23rd May, 1916, after which date he joined the Anglo-Indian
( 2 ) Force. He was on tour for seven days and travelled 680 miles by rail and eight by road. He made inspections of hospitals and dispensaries and partly supervised the work of his subordinate staff. 10. S. M. Raza Husain, the third Deputy Superintendent of the Lucknow sub-division, held charge of the Allahabad sub-division in addition to his own duties during the absence of Mr. Davies. He was on tour for 215 days and travelled 12,459 miles by rail and 968 by road. He attended outbreaks of glanders and farcy in the districts of Basti and Gorakhpur where the disease was of a virulent type and also of surra in the Banda district. His time was chiefly occupied at both the cattle farms for the selection and issue of bulls and supervision of the agricultural operations. He also toured through the tracts where sheep-breeding operations are in progress. He visited Amritsar in connection with the purchase of cattle for farms and agricultural department and assisted the Superintendent, generally in inspections of veterinary hospitals, dis- pensaries, and the subordinate staff. I.( 3 ) the Glanders and Farcy Act. It appeared to have assumed a severe form at Gorakhpur and Basti especially among the ponies of hackney carriages and theka gharries. The outbreak was immediately suppressed. Had the action been not taken in time it would have caused disastrous results. Rupees 680 have been awarded in compensation during the year for compulsory slaughter of animals to poor owners to whom the loss would otherwise be very severe. 20. Surra.( 4 ) Contagious diseases amongst other animals. 32. Pleuropneumonia occurred amongst sheep and goats to a very great extent in the district of Almora and destroyed 2,310 animals, while rabies, canine distemper, fowl cholera, various parasitic ailments are answerable for deaths among the small domesticated animals. Preventive inoculation. See Table III. 33. During the year under report 56,619 protective inoculations and vaccinations have been carried out, chiefly against rinderpest, although haemorrhagic septicaemia and blackquarter have also been treated by these methods. A special effort to deal with a serious outbreak of rinderpest was made in the districts of Dehra Dun and Saharanpur. Two veterinary assistants attached to the office of the Superintendent were deputed to supplement the district veterinary staff. The result was that 10,293 animals were immunized and the outbreaks promptly got in hand. Considering the wide-spread prevalence of disease and the vast area of these districts, it is obvious that but for inoculations very much heavier losses must have ocourred. Other diseases. See Table IV 34. During the past year the veterinary assistants visited 15,010 villages and treated 28,320 animals for diseases other than those already reported on. In addition to this they castrated 312 animals and attended 33,431 cases of contagious disease exclusive of those treated in hospitals and dispensaries. Investigation of disease. 35. During the year under report the work of laboratory has much increased and a great number of specimens of blood, morbid tissues, intestinal parasites, and other materials have been received from the district veterinary staff, veterinary inspectors, district officers, and private persons for examination and opinion. In these cases the results were noted and, where possible, the diagnosis confirmed and the persons interested accordingly informed. Series of experiments were made to find out any effective and practical treatment for piroplasmosis, kamri, and numerous intestinal parasites. The prophylactio and curative effects of distemper, tetanus, and strangles vaccines were tested. 36. In order to make the research and experimental station at Badshah Bagh more useful to the public and to afford a greater opportunity for observation and study of methods of research to the younger members of our staff, it was decided to receive here such obscure oases which cannot be treated conveniently by the district veterinary staff. Forty-five cases were received and treated with satisfactory results. 37. Investigations were conducted in connection with kamri, rinderpest among sheep and goats, sheep-pox, pleuro-pneumonia among goats and sheep, barsati, and several other diseases. Special investigations were made during the year of the sheep and goat diseases in the Kumaun division where several diseases are said to be prevalent causing severe losses every year. It was found that contagious pleuro-pneumonia, locally called bamka, is the most fatal. At the request of this department the Agricultural Adviser to the Government of India has requested the Imperial Bacteriologist, Muktesar, to undertake the necessary investigation of pleuro-pneumonia contagious among sheep and goats in collaboration with this department with a view, if possible, to discovering any method of serum treatment or vaccination. Cattle-poisoning. 38. One hundred and seven cases of cattle-poisoning were reported from 11 districts. These were investigated and handed over to the police to be dealt with. Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. See Table V. 39. There are now 79 hospitals or dispensaries in the province as against 77 last year, being an increase of two, those at Hapur in the Meerut district and Kathgodam, district Naini Tal, were opened during the year. Others are about to be established at Mow in the district, of Azamgarh, Jalaun, Kanauj, district Farrukhabad, and Jaswantnagar, district Etawah. Some additional accommodation
( 5 ) has been provided at Partabgarh, Gorakhpur, and Kasia dispensaries. The new buildings of Unao veterinary hospital are completed. It is very satisfactory and encouraging to record that the total of cases treated during the year at hospitals and dispensaries was : out-patients 85,892 and in-patients 6,582, making a total of 92,474; an increase of 7,998 on last year's return. This shows the popularity of such institutions and that the general public are now realizing their usefulness and the necessity for increasing the number wherever possible. The travelling veterinary dispensary started in the Etawah district is continuing to do good work. 40. The practice of charging fees for castration of inferior sires, both equine and bovine, and for treatment of cattle by certain District Boards was detrimental to the interests of horse and cattle-breeding and to obviate this the District Boards were requested to abolish the same which they very kindly agreed to do. 41. A uniformity of rate of fees to be charged by the District Board hospitals and dispensaries is under preparation and will be submitted to the District Boards for their sanction. III.( 6 ) purchasers and keepers as to the method of utilizing the services of the two classes of bulls, viz., of the submontane and western breeds which are entirely different in their nature and habits and each requires a different line of treatment. Class (1) viz., those bred at the Kheri farm, are of a semi-wild disposition, and cannot be managed in the same way as the more domesticated breeds. It has been found that the best way to deal with them is to allow them to roam with the herds of cows of the selected groups of villages they are used to. Any system of restraint, confinement, or treatment different to that met with in their natural state, makes them vicious and bad coverers. In order to overcome this difficulty it has been arranged to send men of the farm who fully understand the handling of them to remain with the bulls until such time the keeper understands the management and the bulls mix with the herds. In dealing with the other class (2) of cattle, different treatment may be accorded them, and here the most satisfactory way of using the bulls seems to be to locate them in such places as the cows are most suitable and their services most required under some responsible person, preferably of the zamindar class and a man who understands animals, rather than under a person, simply because he is a Government official whose knowledge of cattle is often limited. There should be a herdsman or attendant of the Ahir or Gwala class. Some disappointment has been experienced in the mortality amongst the English cattle imported last year. Despite careful treatment and inoculation against most of the animal plagues several of these animals developed piroplasma in a virulent form and succumbed to the same. It is satisfactory to add that the animals were all insured thus saving Government considerable loss. 48. Two more Ayrshire bulls have been imported and have been put to work. 49. The Civil Veterinary department during the last eight years has been the means of initiating the first systematic scheme of cattle-breeding operations in the province and has not only established the breeding farms but has introduced the system of locating stud bulls all over the province for the use of breeders which promises to be very successful. It has furthermore started registers of breeding certificates of produce, etc, which are greatly appreciated by breeders. In the future however this work must of necessity rapidly increase and in consequence of the paucity of supervising officers and the enormous demand on their time, in dealing with the technical duties of the department in the control and treatment of disease it would be impossible without very considerable increase in the superior staff to continue the supervision and control of breeding operations in addition to the legitimate veterinary duties. It is proposed therefore that when possible the department should be relieved of this cattle-breeding work which Will be carried out by a special officer appointed by the Agricultural department. (2) EQUINE (UNDER LOCAL BODIES). (i) Horse and pony stallions. See Table X. 50. At the beginning of the year there were 65 horse and pony stallions at stud belonging to this department. 61. Five stallions were purchased during the year, two were castrated and sold as they were unfit for further stud work, two destroyed, thus leaving a balance of 66 at the end of the year. See Table XI. 52. Fifty-five sires were employed at stud work during the year and the number of mares covered by these stallions amounted to 3,440, being an increase of 109 over last year's figure which is very satisfactory considering the scarcity of mares on account of their demand for war and mounted police. 53. Regarding young stock, the progeny of the provincial stallions shows a continued improvement and particularly in the following districts :( 7 ) horse and pony from a point of general utility in those tracts other than the four selected districts. The past few years have seen a very considerable improvement in the quality of the animals bred in these unselected districts which fully vindicates the very small expenditure incurred in this direction. (ii) Donkey stallions. See Table X and XI. 55. At the commencement of the year there were 19 provincial donkeys on the register, two died, thus leaving a balance of 17. Of these, 14 were at stud and the number of mares covered by them amounted to 689 being a decrease of 131. Sheep-breeding. 56. The sheep-breeding experiments undertaken by this department during the last few years with a view to improve the quality and quantity of the wool of the indigenous sheep continue to be very encouraging and highly satisfactory. The introduction of the Merino strain has been found to steadily have the desired beneficial effect on the fleeces in point of their all-round richness. It is very gratifying to note that funds have partly been sanctioned for starting a sheep-rearing farm in the budget for 1917-18 and it is expected that a suitable plot of land will shortly be acquired in the district of Jalaun and a proper sheep farm gradually run on more practical lines. A few half-bred rams have been issued to several districts, to court of wards estates, and others and the reports received up to date have been distinctly encouraging. Fairs and shows. See Table XIV. 57. Wherever possible these fairs and shows were attended by officers of the Civil Veterinary department and Mr. Oliver was present and judged exhibits at the Dewa fair, district Bara Banki. The first Deputy Superintendent, M. Niaz Muhammed, was deputed to Tigri, Budaun, Etawah, Aligarh, Bulandshahr, Nauchandi, and Muzaffarnagar fairs and shows and in most of these fairs veterinary instruments and remedies were exhibited and magic lantern demonstrations on animal subjects to the cultivators attending the fairs were given. I personally attended and judged the cattle and other animals at the Budaun and Etawah shows. Rupees one thousand seven hundred and forty-one were contributed towards prize awards and this amount was distributed at Tigri, Ballia, Dewa, Budaun, and Bulandshahr fairs. IV.( 8 ) and supervising the work connected with horse, cattle, and sheep-breeding and inspection and care of stud sires. Cattle pounds, dairy sheds, etc, have been visited by them. They visited 4,846 villages and attended 501 outbreaks. The veterinary assistants attached to headquarters staff have been found to be of greatest assistance and in many cases they were the only means of relieving district veterinary assistants when they proceed on leave, and thus prevent a locality from being left entirely without veterinary help. They conduct inoculations and make special investigations and enquiries regarding disease, breeding operations and are, often deputed to obtain morbid material for research purposes.

No. 1538/XI(Maximum limit of report(2) Table no. VIII.Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary department, United Provinces, 1917-18. 1. The administration report of the department for the year ending March the 31st, 1918, is herewith submitted. 2. I was on leave up to the 24th September, 1917, and on my return I held charge of the department throughout the rest of the year. I also carried out the duties of the 2nd Superintendent in addition to ray own from the 17th December, 1917. 3. Mr. S. G. M. Hickey, 2nd Superintendent officiated as Superintendent during my absence on leave, in addition to his own duties. His services were placed at the disposal of the Military department from the 17th December, 1917. 4. Tours of officers.(2) one failed. Of the first year students three have passed and have moved on to the 2nd year class. Of the Punjab students, six passed their final examination and joined the department, one failed in one subject but will be allowed to go up for re-examination in June. Out of eight in the 2nd year class, six have passed and are promoted to the 3rd year division, while two failed. One of these has been allowed to continue his studies, and the other was removed. Of the nine students in their first year, seven passed and joined the 2nd year class, two failed in one subject each but have been permitted to go up for re-examination in June. 9. The United Provinces Veterinary Medical Society, started by the subordi- nate staff in 1912 continues doing good work and is publishing the Urdu Veterina- ry Journal monthly. 10. Owing to the paucity of staff nothing has yet been done towards the training of compounders. 11. Demonstrations and lectures on veterinary subjects were given by members of the staff in some of the important fairs and shows. II.(3) See table III. 20. Haemorrhagic septicaemia.(4) attended 45,782 cases of contagious diseases exclusive of those treated in hospitals and dispensaries. 29. Investigation of disease.(5) (ii) Bull-rearing and breeding farms and dépóts. See table IX. 36. Kheri cattle farm.(6) Veterinary department has addressed district boards, and other public bodies pointing out the improbability of any improvement in the situation for some years to come, and urging upon them the importance of lending every encouragement and help in the matter of horse-breeding by locating Government sires wherever possible and advising owners to retain and reserve their best mares for breeding purposes. (ii) Donkey stallions. See tables X and XI. 47. At the commencement of the year there wore 17 provincial donkeys on the register and three were purchased during the year. Two died thus leaving a balance of 18. Of these 13 were at stud and the number of mares covered by them amounted to 698 being an increase of 9. Sheep-breeding. 48. The sheep-breeding experiments undertaken by this department during the last few years with a view to improve the quality and quantity of the wool of the indigenous sheep continue to be very encouraging and highly satisfactory. The introduction of the Merino strain has been found to steadily have the desired beneficial effect on the fleeces in point of their weight and all-round richness. Experimental flocks of selected ewes are located at Lucknow, Moradabad, Kheri, Muttra, Bundelkhand and Etawah. 49. Experiments have been carried out in regard to dipping of sheep and a portable bath for this purpose kindly presented to the department by Messrs. Cooper and Co., Sheep Dip Manufacturers has been of great service. The results have proved that in India as well as in other countries judicious and periodical dipping of sheep is of immense benefit to the fleoce as well as to the general health of the animal. 50. There are a considerable amount of difficulties to bo surmounted in order to carry out sheep-breeding successfully on improved lines. The mortality of the imported stock is somewhat large owing to the extreme change of olimate, the prevalonce of epizootics and parasitic diseases to which they are almost daily exposed, and even the native sheep are not altogether immune to these scourges. It is hoped however that the graded up progeny will acquire from the native parent or grand-parent a degree of immunity to the effects of the climate and to certain of the most dangerous sheep diseases. 61. The proper handling of sheep and wool including careful methods of shearing, dipping, and packing of fleeces etc. is practically unknown to Indian shepherds and great difficulty has been experienced in this direction. The condi- tion in which wool is turned out makes a considerable difference to its value in the market, and if we are to continue our experiments with a view to building up the woollen industry this is one of the points which will necessitate some attention. 52. A further batch of 12 Merino rams has been received from Australia this year and will shortly be put into stud work. A great demand for the half- bred male stock for introducing into native flocks is beginning to arise. Sixty young rams have already been issued and indents for a further 40 have been received. 53. The original proposal to establish a sheep farm near Orai has for the present been abandoned owing to shortage of staff but a strip of land is being acquired adjacent to the Muttra cattle farm where the sheep run will temporarily be maintained as it will have the advantage of being under the direct observation of the farm officials. Fares and Shows. See talbe XIV. 54. Wherever possible fairs and shows were attended by officers of the Civil Veterinary department and I was present and judged exhibits at the Bara Banki fair. The Deputy Superintendent, M. Niaz Muhammad, was deputed to Tigri, Etawah, and Nauchandi fairs and shows and in most of these fairs veterinary instruments and remedies were exhibited. 55. Rupees one thousand three hundred and three were distributed as prize awards at Tigri, Ballia, Bara Banki, Banda, Lucknow and Bulandshahr fairs. 56. In the past cattle shows have not on the whole proved successful in these provinces, and very little improvement in breeds can be traced to them.
(7) It has been noticed that much better results can be obtained by officers of the department personally visiting the breeding centres and encouraging and instruct- ing the breeders. 57. The Civil Veterinary department has proposed the giving of advances for the purchase of good cows where persons are in need of this concession, and instructions have been circulated for the proper care and management of breeding stock, and the rearing of young calves. In order to bring about intelligent selection in regard to the mating of the cattle, and careful methods of management, a scheme has been introduced for the local award of prizes for the best specimens of calves bred from cows of good type and sired by Govern- ment bulls. Due notice has been given of the dates from which these awards will commence, in order to allow intending breeders sufficient time to obtain likely cows for the purpose. IV.(8) and a number of extra stallions have been purchased and located where it is thought some increased interest in this industry might be stimulated. Sheep- breeding experiments also continue to give very satisfactory results. Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries are becoming more numerous and show a yearly increase in attendance as the demand for veterinary help extends. In view of the world shortage of food stuffs and the impending shrinkage in the supply of horse the importance of leaving nothing undone to maintain, improve and increase the numbers of the live-stock in India becomes more and more apparent. The increased prevalence of surra during the year has given cause for some anxiety. The spread of this malady from its endemic areas or centres is accounted for by the unusually extensive transport operations and frequent movements of animals which on account of military requirements have taken place during the past two years. In addition to these causes we must consider the yearly increasing facilities for travel and the development of commercial intercourse between distant parts of the country, and it is easy to foresee a still further spread of infection unless energetic prophylactic measures are introduced without further loss of time. Whatever line of action is contemplated it is all important that the preventative measures taken must be swift and thorough I am strongly of opinion that if we are to avert such a catastrophe as that which occurred in Mauritius in 1902-3, more effective legislation than at present exists should be introduced at once. In 1910 it was decided that with certain modifications, and at the discretion of local administrations, the Glanders and Farcy Act could be applied in cases of surra, but although this was introduced in the case of the United Provinces, in some of the adjacent territories and provinces no active steps in this direction were taken. It is obvious that compulsory slaughter of all diseased animals, and isolation of suspected cases and in contacts is one of the first and most important measures to be adopted, but if this rule is only enforced here and there, the result cannot be anything but a costly failure. The Surra Act or a modifed or amended form of it should be applied without exception throughout the whole of India. Next in importance to the destruction of all affected cases is the more complete control of the movements of all animals in the diseased localities, and powers should be acquired to declare affected areas, and where necessary prohibit ingress and egress to and from such places. Rules for the closing of fairs and the prohibition of animal traffic on certain highways if desirable might be considered. Great inconvenience is still felt for want of suitable office accommodation. 63. For rendering genuine assistance in the work of inoculation seven certificates have been awarded. 64. I am indebted to Mr. Hickey who was up to 16th December, 1917, 2nd Superintendent, and who has now joined the I. A. R. O, for the assistance he has rendered me daring an arduous year in the control of the department and the suppression of disease and also to the Deputy Superintendents M. Niaz Muhammad and S. M. Raza Husain who have also worked with great energy and zeal. The work of the subordinate staff both clerical and technical has been most satisfactory, and in many cases one man has been doing the work of two and sometimes three. The head clerk Babu Srish Chandra Bhattacharjya deserves special credit for his work which has this year by reason of the amalgamation of the offices become much increased. E. W.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, UNITED PROVINCES, FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31ST MARCH, 1919. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] ALLAHABAD: Printed by the Superintendent, Government Press, United Provinces. 1919.
No. 1561/XI-925 OF 1919. FROM THE HON'BLE MR. H. R. C. HAILEY, C.I.E., I.C.S., DIRECTOR OF LAND RECORDS AND AGRICULTURE, UNITED PROVINCES, TO THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, UNITED PROVINCES, INDUSTRIES DEPARTMENT, NAINI TAL. DATED LUCKNOW, THE 26TH JUNE, 1919. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward the report on the administration of the Civil Veterinary Department for the year ending 31st March, 1919. 2. As the details of the year's working show, the Department has continued to perform most valuable, if somewhat unobtrusive, work in the prevention and cure of animal disease. Its operations have been greatly hampered by the shortage of the staff, owing to the absence of men on military duty, yet there has been an increase in the number of hospitals and dispensaries maintained, and all serious outbreaks of disease have been promptly met by the despatch of special officers to the localities affected. 3. The cattle-breeding branch of the department has been strengthened by the appointment of Mr. Stow, who has experience in this work, as Farms Manager. In spite of the scarcity of fodder, there was an increase in the number of stud bulls and buffaloes distributed, and the question of enlarging the western farm to meet the growing demand is under consideration. Awards of money- prizes and certificates were made to owners of the best young stock bred from stud bulls. This method of encouraging breeding and the Care of young animals is found to be popular, and some very good specimens were brought for exhibition. There is every reason to hope that the combined scheme of issuing stud bulls on loan and giving prizes locally for the young stock will stimulate an interest in cattle-breeding. 4. The additional grant made by Government has permitted of an increase in the number of horse and pony stallions which now amount to 72 in the districts not controlled by the Remount Department. Mr. Oliver reports that there has been a noticeable increase in the demand for their services. The sheep-breeding experiments Continue to give encouraging results. There has been a steady improvement in both the quantity and quality of the wool of the flocks and satisfactory report on the samples submitted has been received from the Cawnpore Woollen Mills. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, H. R. C. HAILEY, Director.
(Maximum limit of report(2) 1 Pages. Table no. VIII.Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, United Provinces, 1918-19. 1. The administration report of the department for the year ending the 31st March, 1919, is herewith submitted. 2. I held charge of the department during the year, and in addition to this work I carried out the duties of the second Superintendent, who throughout the year continued to be on military duty. 3. Mr. R. A. Stow, whose appointment has been sanctioned in G. O. no. 1869/XVIII(2) promoted to the 3rd-year class, while one failed in one subject, but has been permitted to appear for re-examination in June. Of the six students in the first year, two were removed for ill-health and four passed and went on to the next higher class. 9. The United Provinces Veterinary Medical Society, which was started in 1912 by the members of the civil veterinary staff, is doing good work and is greatly to bo encouraged as means of keeping the members up to date in their scientific knowledge, and promoting an interchange of professional ideas. Much good work has been done by means of magic lantern demonstrations dealing with veterinary work, and connected with live-stock generally. It is intonded to hold a meeting this year in which awards will bo made for the best papers read on scientific and agricultural subjects. 10. Demonstrations and loctures on veterinary subjects were given by members of the staff in some of the important fairs and shows. 11. The scheme for establishing a veterinary college for these provinces has been held back for sometime owing to the War and other causes. The diffi- culty experienced in obtaining veterinary assistants to carry on the work of this rapidly expanding department is becoming greater yearly, and must in the near future necessitate the provision of means for the education of these officers. II.(3) on the other hand, many were affected by a benign form of the disease which was quickly suppressed. The disease assumed a very virulent type in the districts of Naini Tal, Bijnor, Budaun, Jalaun, Banda, and Hamirpur, where outbreaks were promptly attended to and necessary steps taken for preventing its spread. Where the district veterinary staff was insufficient to cope with the disease, some of the headquarters veterinary staff were deputed and rendered considerable assistance. Inoculations were carried out in 39 districts. See table III. 20. Haemorrhagic Septicaemia.(4) 29, Cattle poisoning.(5) 39. There are 262 head of live-stock now on the farm and their health during the last year has been particularly good. Here, again, shortage of fodder owing to the drought and want of labour following the influenza epidemic somewhat delayed progress. 40. Both of these farms which have been the last few years in the process of building up, are now getting into working order, and with the appointment of the new Farms Manager, who will be able to devote his almost entire attention to them, great improvements should soon be forthcoming. (2) Equine (Under Local Bodies.) (i) Horse and pony stallions. See table X. 41. At the beginning of the year there were 72 horse and pony stallions at stud belonging to this department. 42. Eleven were purchased during the year. Two were destroyed and two died, leaving a balance of 79 on the list at the end of the year. See table XI. 43. Sixty-six sires were at stud work during the year and the number of mares covered by them amounted to 3,426 against 3,323. 44. Regarding young stock the progeny of these provincial sires, there is a continued improvement and promise shown by them in nany parts, particularly in the districts of Saharanpur, Budaun, Moradabad, and Shahjahanpur. Some excellent good stock was noticed during my inspections which were the progeny of the Arabs "Meteor," "Red Shank," "Different," "Copenhagen," "Midday," "Spectator," "Forester," "Sheen," "Flying Bird" "Vigilant," and "Atlas." 45. The functions of this department, in so far as horse-breeding is concerned, are confined to the improvement of the indigenous horse and pony for general utility purposes in those tracts other, than the four selected districts of Aligarh, Muzaffarnagar, Bulandshahr, and Meerut, and it is noticeable that these tracts which were primarily considered unsuitable for horse-breeding are now proving themselves capable of producing a very good type of animal, which may be confidently expected to still further improve. 46. As year by year we have been gradually replacing the old stallions (some of which were somewhat small) by young strong sires of 14.1 hands and over, there has now arisen a noticeable increase in the demand for them. (ii) Donkey stallions. See tables X and XI. 47. At the commencement of the year there were 18 provincial donkey stallions on the register and one was purchased during the year, thus making a total of 19. Of these, 15 were at stud work and the number of mares covered by them amounted to 835 against 698 of the last year, being an increase of 137. 48. Owing to the difficulty in obtaining donkey stallions an attempt is being made to breed them ourselves and for this reason some donkey mares have been purchased. 49. Sheep-breeding.(6) 53. Rupees three hundred and seventy-six were distributed as prizes at Ballia, Bara Banki, Dehra Dun, Gorakhpur, and Partabgarh. 54. In the past, cattle shows have not on the whole proved successful in these provinces, and very little improvement in breeds can be traced to them. The scheme of visiting the breeding tracts themselves and personally awarding prizes to the best young stock got by Government bulls is now being put into practice and is hoped will meet with encouragement.

Baza Husain, deputy superintendent, was employed at head- quarters, and in charge of the Allahabad sub-division until the return of Mr. Davies, when he assumed charge of the Agra sub-division. During the year he has been 210 days on tour and travelled 9,317 miles by rail and 1,177 miles by road. He attended outbreaks of glanders in the districts of Basti, Gorakhpur, Allahabad, and Agra where the disease was of a virulent type. He supervised the work of the veterinary inspecto s and assistants, and assisted in cattle-breeding operations. He also toured through the tracts where sheep and cattle-breeding is in progress, and gave instructions in the practical work of the department to the newly-qualified graduates. He attended cattle fairs at Dewa (Bara Banki), Unao, Makanpur (Cawnpore), Aligarh, Bulandshahr, and Meerut. I.(3) 19. Surra.(4) who regard it as the only satisfactory measure to be adopted, and it is to be feared that this continued inability to inoculate their cattle owing to shortage of serum will eventually shake their confidence in this branch of work which has taken so many years to secure. In view of the shortage of material, however, the veterinary staff were directed to pay strict attention to segregation, sanitation, and hygiene, as well as care in feeding and general management, and it is believed that but for this a much heavier mortality would have been recorded. It is estimated that something like 150,000 inoculations would have been conducted if the material had been obtainable. See table IV. 31. Other diseases-(5) It has therefore been decided to hand over this branch of work to the Agricultural department and from next year it will be controlled by a special officer for the purpose, to be designated Deputy Director of Agriculture for cattle- breeding. (ii) Bull-rearing and breeding farms and dépôts. See table IX. 40. Kheri cattle farm.(6) (2) SHEEP-BREEDING. 49. It is now seven years since the Civil Veterinary department decided to give the subject of sheep-breeding in these provinces its serious attention, and in 1915 a preliminary note on certain experiments was published. This set forth the history of the early sheep-breeding operations in India and analysed the causes which had usually led to failure in the past. It pointed out that in attempting to improve the breeds of domesticated animals continuity of policy is the first consideration. Too often, especially in Government enterprises, this factor is entirely wanting owing to the frequent changes of directing officers. The success in establishing celebrated flocks is usually due to the continuance of a sound policy first laid down by the original breeder and carried on by his sons or successors. 50. During those years three sets of experiments have been carried out and the results which have been achieved have been entirely satisfactory. In addition to the operations entirely connected with breeding much experience has been gained regarding feeding and general management of sheep; for it will be easily realised that in a country like India where the pastoral and climatic conditions differ so vastly from other sheep-breeding tracts special provision is necessary to maintain the health of the flock. Our main line of experiment was that of crossing the Indian ewe with the Australian Merino. The result of this first cross is usually very striking and instead of hair (for such only can it be described) such as is found on the Indian ewe, the fleece of the half-bred exhibits distinct features of wool. In most oases there is an increase of staple with a greater strength and softness. Its most noticeable feature is the increased "swint" or natural lanoline which is practically non- existent in the common Indian sheep, the absence of which gives to the wool the harsh dry character which is so noticeable. The yield is greater in quantity and its market value is three to four times that of country wool. The shape of the first cross-bred also differs from that of its dam. The head assumes a nearer approach to the shape of its male parent and the roman nose and lop ears characteristic of desi breeds begin to disappear. In the best specimens the half- bred is not as leggy as the Indian sheep but does not improve much in size of carcase. This experiment was followed up by selecting the best of these half-bred ewes and mating them to the Australian Merino, the progeny being classed as three quarter-bred. These lambs presented perhaps more irregularity, than was the case with the half-breds, and although most of them showed a still further improvement, there were some that did not appear to benefit much from the second cross. However when carefully examined there were points which at first unnoticed had ultimately to be appreciated. The wool became longer in staple, is finer, softer, and has a decided crimp. It still contains a certain amount of kemp. The latest cross of lambs has been bred from these three-quarter-bred ewes by a Merino and here a very appreciable improvement in the quality and quantity of the wool has been achieved. 51. It is hoped that by mating these graded ewes with similarly graded rams the improvement will remain fixed. 52. The second set of experiments was carried out on the lines of Mendel, that is to say, the half-bred ewes were mated with half-bred Merino rams (unrela- ted). The result of this was not altogether satisfactory, certainly some lambs exhibited a fixed improvement, but many seemed to decline somewhat in quality. It has been decided not to proceed any further on these lines at present. 53. The third series of experiments was that of introducing half-bred rams into country flocks. Here it was found we had a useful way of disposing of our young surplus male half-breds and it is thought that if even this does not improve the wool very rapidly; it certainly would be better for the native flocks to be sired by rams of this description than by the indigenous country ram which in most cases is closely related to ewes he runs with. At first these animals were given away to deserving shepherds, but a demand for them has arisen and we are now able to sell them for moderately large prices. It is difficult in many cases to ascertain what the result has been, but in those flocks under intelligent supervision a considerable improvement on the country stock has been noted. 54. So far our experiments have been confined to wool and we have depend- ed on the Merino for improving this commodity. In view of the increased demand for mutton and its enhanced price together with the probability of cold
(7) storage installations in the future, there is no reason why the improvement in the fleece should not be accompanied by an improvement in the carcase for mutton. It is therefore proposed to carry out some further experiments with a view to bringing this about. For this purpose a batch of Romney Marsh rams are now being imported. 55. One hundred and forty-three half-bred stud Merino rams have now been issued to private flocks in the districts of Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Buland- shahr, Aligarh, Muttra, Etah, Bijnor, Moradabad, Jalaun, Banda, Fatehpur, Allahabad, Benares, Gorakhpur, Basti, Garhwal, Lucknow, Unao, Sitapur, Kheri, Gonda, and Bahraich. The department maintains experimental flocks at Lucknow, Moradabad, Muttra, Etawah, Kheri, and Naini Tal, and a scheme is under consideration for establishing an extensive sheep run in Bundelkhand. 56. Samples of the wool produced from the Government flocks have been submitted to experts in Cawnpore and Bradford. The quality of the yield of the wool has been reported on most favourably. The fleeces from the 1919-20 clip fetched as much as Rs. 1-12 per pound and sold for Rs. 1,224. (3) POULTRY-BREEDING. 57. A small demonstration poultry run has been established in Lucknow in connection with the research station and it is intended to start others in connection with the cattle farms. (4) EQUINE (UNDER LOCAL BODIES). (i) Horse and pony stallions. See table X. 58 At the beginning of the year there were 79 horse and pony stallions at stud belonging to this department. Nine were purchased during the year, one died, six were destroyed, and three were castrated and sold as they were unfit for further stud work, thus leaving a balance of 78 at the end of the year. See table XI. 59. Sixty-seven sires were employed at stud work during the year and the number of mares covered by these stallions amounted to 3,468, being an increase of 42 over last year's figures which is very satisfactory. 60. Regarding young stock, the progeny of the provincial sires shows a continued improvement and particularly in the following districts(8) overseers four, veterinary assistants employed in districts 149, veterinary assistants employed by municipalities 15, veterinary assistants deputed to Military depart- ment six and veterinary assistants attached to headquarters staff (including the Bhabar and Tarai estates and the Cawnpore Agricultural farm) 14, or in all 204 against 197 of last year, making an increase of seven. 66. The veterinary inspectors did very useful work and were engaged during the year in the inspection and checking of the work of veterinary assistants conducting inoculations and other measures to suppress outbreaks; in inspecting and supervising the work connected with horse, cattle, and sheep-breeding and inspection and care of stud sires. Cattle pounds, dairy sheds, etc., have been visited by them. They were on tour for 4,049 days, travelled 19,771 miles by rail, 24,588 by road and visited 5,306 villages. The veterinary assistants attached to headquarters staff have been found to be of the greatest assistance and in many cases they were the only means of relieving district veterinary assistants when they proceeded on leave, and thus preventing a locality from being left ontirely without veterinary help. They conduct inoculations and make special investiga- tions and enquiries regarding disease, breeding operations, and are often deputed to obtain morbid material for research purposes. V.-EXPENDITURE OF THE DEPARTMENT. See table XIVA. 67. The cost of the department according to the statement furnished by the Accountant-General is Rs. 1,80,464 against Rs. 1,59,770, being an increase of Rs. 20,694. The increase is mainly due to the expansion of the department.

Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, United Provinces, 1920-21. 1. The administration report of the department for the year ending the 31st March, 1921, is herewith submitted. 2. Major E. W. Oliver held charge of the department up to and for the 22nd September, 1920, when he proceeded on combined leave. He also carried out the duties of the second superintendent in addition to his own work up to and for 16th June, 1920 during my absence on leave. 3. On my return from leave, I took over charge of the duties of the second superintendent and from the 23rd September, 1920 I have held charge of the duties of the superintendent and veterinary adviser to the end of the year in addi- tion to my own. 4. Captain W. H. Priston, F.R.C.V.S., who has been appointed as the 3rd superintendent of the Civil Veterinary department, United Provinces, by His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, landed at Bombay on 1st December, 1920 and assumed charge of the duties on the forenoon of the 4th December, 1920. He is at present under training. 5. Tours of officers.(2) and assistants. He inspected every dispensary, stallion and bull stand. A good deal of his time was spent in dealing with outbreaks of glanders in Meerut and Aligarh and an outbreak of surra amongst camels in Agra. He personally attended the outbreak of rinderpest which was prevalent in virulent form in the Jhansi district and supervised inoculation. He attended fairs and shows at Meerut, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Batesar, Etawah, and Makanpur and explained to cattle-owners simple veterinary hygiene and the principles of scientific breeding. He was occasionally deputed to the Madhuri Kund cattle farm, Muttra, to examine cattle reported to be suffering from various diseases. He also visited the outbreak of rinderpest at the Manjhra cattle farm, Kheri. I.(3) BOVINE. 23. Rinderpest.(4) 34. Cattle-poisoning (5) 45. The following additions, etc were made during the year under review at a cost of Rs. 2.283; oil godown, motor tractor shed, bullock shed, culverts and syphons and kutsha irrigation channels for irrigation, repairs to sheep houses, and servants' quarters. 46. One hundred and fifty-four acres of land were cultivated during the year at cost of Rs. 3,980 and which yielded a return of 19,86,281 lbs. grain and fodder, the market value of which was estimated at Rs. 18,772. This, together with the grazing, fed the stock, leaving a balance of 4,49,611 lbs., which will feed the stock up to the breaking of the monsoon. It was hoped to create a six months' reserve but owing to the poor grazing due to the weak monsoon it had to be broken into. For the last six months the cattle have been stall-fed at the rate of 7,000 lbs. of green and dry fodder per day. The following fodders, etc, were grown:(6) breeding to fix a type and thus produce a bread of sheep that will be more pro- fitable in wool and mutton qualities and unaffected by the Indian climatic conditions. 52. The best animal so far produced by the department's breeding experi- ments is the seven-eighth Merino cross, but it lacks size and mutton qualities, also it is not fixed in type. There are a number among them not better than three-quarter bred strain. 53. The health of the sheep at Muttra has on the whole been good but a fairly large percentage of lambs died at Kheri, due in most cases to internal parasites. The Muttra farm is in every way superior to Kheri as a sheep run. The pasture at Kheri being poor and the ground low lying is in a bad state as regards parasites. The number of births of lambs have been satisfactory. The grade sheep produce a greater percentage than the country and are better rearers. 54. In future the flocks will be restricted to the following proportions, and increases over these figures will be sold off:(7) balance at the end of the year remains the same. Of these donkeys, 16 were at stud work and the number of mares covered by them amounted to 870, which shows an increase of 12 on last year's figures. There appears to be still an increasing demand for the services of these animals for mule-breeding, but it is difficult to meet the demand as we have only a limited number available. See table XIV. 63. Fairs and shows.(8) 70 Investigation into the prevalence of tuberculosis in cattle was carried out in a small way and a separate report is being submitted to Government. It is hoped next cold weather to take the matter up more fully. 71. Plans for the establishment of a veterinary college at Lucknow are being drawn up by the Government Architect on the same lines as the veterinary college, Lahore, and will be submitted to Government for final sanction. 72. The new offices and laboratory are in the course of erection and it is hoped will be ready by the beginning of the cold weather, 73. For rendering genuine assistance in inoculation work and encourage- ment of animal-breeding two sanads have been awarded. 74. Mr. Stow has continued to carry out his duties in a hard-working and painstaking manner and the farms under his charge are continuing to show a steady progress. Mr. Evans has continued to carry out his work in connection with sheep-breeding in a very active manner. I am indebted to the Deputy Superintendents Khan Sahib Sheikh Niaz Muhammad, S .M. Raza Husain, and Mr. T. S. Davies for their valuable assistance and help they have rendered me during the year. The subordinate staff, both clerical and veterinary, have con- tinued to work most satisfactorily during the year.

No. 3011 XIX-11(Maximum limit of report(ii) LIST OF APPENDICES. PAGES. Table no. II.Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, United Provinces, 1921-22. 1. The administration report of the department for the year ending the 31st March, 1922, is herewith submitted. 2. I was on leave up to the 29th August, 1921, and on my return I held charge of the department throughout the rest of the year. 3. Captain S. G. M. Hickey, 2nd Superintendent, officiated as Veterinary Adviser to Government, United Provinces, during my absence on leave in addition to his own duties. He proceeded on combined leave with effect from the forenoon of the 2nd November, 1921. 4. Captain W. H. Priston, 3rd Superintendent, held charge of the current duties of the office of 2nd Superintendent in addition to his own when Captain Hickey proceeded on leave. 5. The services of Mr. R. A. Stow, Farms Manager, have been transferred to the Agriculture department from the 1st December, 1921. 6. Tours of officers.( 2 ) and checked. He made inspections of veterinary dispensaries, stallion and bull stands of his sub-division and attended outbreaks of glanders in the districts of Gorakhpur and Basti. He personally attended cattle fairs at Ballia, Bara Banki, and Fatehpur. 12. S. M. Raza Husain, Deputy Superintendent, was in charge of the Agra sub-division during the year. He was 189 days on tour and travelled 11,091 miles by rail and 1,228 miles by road, and inspected every dispensary, stallion, and bull stand in his circle. He checked the work of veterinary inspectors as well as that of touring veterinary assistants. He attended outbreaks of cattle disease in Jhansi, Banda, Aligarh, Agra, Farrukhabad, Btawah, and Muttra and personally conducted inoculations in some of these districts. He attended the cattle and horse fairs at Batesar (Agra), Makanpur (Cawnpore), Etawah, and Nauchandi (Meerut). I.-VETERINARY INSTRUCTION. 13. This year only two students for training at the Bengal veterinary college were selected and sent. 14. The non-selection of students for training at the Punjab veterinary college last year was due to Government sanction having not been received for the increased cost of their training, as the result of the new arrangements of the Pun- jab veterinary college. It is expected that four students will be sent there for training from this year. Of those students, who were already undergoing a course of study at the Bengal veterinary college, one in the final class passed and joined the department. Out of the three including the one who failed last year in the 2nd year class but was subsequently allowed to prosecute his studies in that class, all passed and were promoted to the 3rd year, and the three in the first year passed their examination and were promoted to the next higher class. Of the Punjab students, the three in the 3rd year, passed and joined the department and out of four in the 2nd year, all passed and were promoted to the 3rd year class. 15. The United Provinces Veterinary Medical Society, started by the subordinate staff in 1912, continues to do good work, and is publishing the Urdu Veterinary Journal monthly. II( 3 ) BOVINEG.B.V.C. 23. Rinderpest.( 4 ) already been pub in hand. The construction of a new building in Moradabad is complete. The district boards of Mainpuri, Basti, and Gonda are contemplating the erection of new buildings according to the standard plan. 35. It is very satisfactory and encouraging to note that the total number of cases treated during the year at hospitals and dispensaries was( 5 ) (4) EQUINE (UNDER LOCAL BODIES). (i) Horse and pony stallions. See table X. 48. At the beginning of the year under report there were 76 stallions on the register, all being the property of the Provincial Government. 49. Two Arab stallions were purchased by the department during the year and one thoroughbred horse was imported from England. Two were cas- trated and sold as they were unfit for further stud purposes, two were destroyed, and two died thus leaving a balance of 73. See tables XI. 50. Sixty-one stallions were at stud work and the mares covered by them were 3,167 as against 3,524 of last year, being a decrease of 357. This decrease is due to the employment of fewer stallions owing to the closing of three stands in the districts of Dehra Dun, Allahabad, and Bahraich on account of want of funds. 5.1. Applications for locating of stallions in the districts of Etah, Bijnor, Pilibhit, Cawnpore, and Rampur State have been received. 52. Regarding the young stock, the progeny of these provincial stallions a continued improvement is noticeable, particularly in the districts of Saharanpur, Moradabad, Budaun, and Shahjahanpur. Most of the stallions in these tracts are very popular with the breeders and have maintained their high standard and reputation as foal-getters. The Officiating 2nd Superintendent while assisting in the judging of horse and cattle fairs at Saharanpur was highly impressed with the class of horse exhibited there and most of which were the progeny of these stallions belonging to the United Provinces Government. 53. As mentioned in previous reports, the functions of this department, as far as horse-breeding is concerned, are confined to the improvement of the indi- genous horse and pony from a point of general utility in those tracts other than the four selected districts. The past few years have witnessed a very consider- able improvement in the quality of the animal bred in these unselected districts which fully justifies the very small expenditure incurred in this direction. (ii) Donkey stallions. See table X and XI. 54. At the commencement of the year there were 19 provincial donkey stallions on the register; one died, leaving a balance of 18. Of these, 15 were at stud work and the number of mares covered by them amounted to 755 as against 870, being a decrease of 115. The decrease is due to the fact that about four of them have become unserviceable, due to old age, and require replacement. Fairs and shows. See table XIV. 55. Wherever possible, fairs and shows were attended by officers of the Civil Veterinary department. In most of these fairs and shows veterina y instru- ments and remedies were exhibited, and magic lantern demonstrations on animal subjects were given to the cultivators attending the fairs. 56. Rupees two thousand one hundred and severity-five were distributed in prizes at Saharanpur, Bulandshahr, Moradabad, Cawnpore, Ballia, and Bara Banki. IV.( 6 ) assistants attached to the headquarters staff have been found to be of the greatest assistance, and in many cases they were the only means of relieving district veterinary assistants, when they proceeded on leave, and to thus prevent some localities from being left entirely without veterinary help. They conduct inoculations and make special investigations and enquiries regarding disease, and breeding operations, and are often deputed to obtain morbid material for research puposes. V.( 7 ) 66. My thanks are due to Captain S. G. M. Hickey and Captain W. H. Priston for the able assistance they have given me in the control of the depart- ment and also to the three Deputy Superintendents, Khan Sahib S. Niaz Moham- med, Mr. T. S. Davies and S. M. Raza Husain, who have worked with energy and zeal. The work of the subordinate staff, both clerical and technical, has been most satisfactory. Good work has been performed by the office staff under the able guidance of the head assistant Babu Srish Chandra Bhattacharya. E. W.
