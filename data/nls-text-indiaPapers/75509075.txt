ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN INDIA FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1905-1906. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. Preface. The districts over which the operations of the Department extend are the same as last year and are shown in light red on the map which accompanies this report. Some slight rearrangement of the charges of officers has been rendered necessary by the creation of the new Province of Eastern Bengal and Assam. 2. The forms accompanying the report having now been in existence for a whole year contain more complete information than it was possible to show in them last year. 3. Colonel J. W. A. Morgan has been in charge of the office of Inspector- General during the whole of the year except for one month and nineteen days, when Major H. T. Pease officiated for him. Officers in charge. 4. The following table gives the names of the officers who held the several appointments in the Department during the year under report:2 5. Considerable progress has been made in the development of the super- vising staff of the Department, no less than 7 new appointments having been sanctioned during the year. The posts they are intended to occupy are :3 The percentage of passes was 90 per cent. in the Punjab, 66 per cent. in Bombay and 47 per cent. in Bengal. 14. The results at the Bengal Veterinary College were not so satisfactory as in former years, only 47 per cent. passing the final test against 80 per cent. last year. This is due to the fact that the teaching staff employed during the year was quite inadequate. There was only one Imperial Veterinary Officer present in Bengal and he held two posts, viz, Superintendent of the Provincial Veterinary Department and Principal of the Bengal College. It is of course quite impossible for one man to lecture and teach in a College and attend to district duties satisfactorily as well, so that either one of these duties becomes' a purely nominal one or both are badly performed. Mr. Burke, the Assistant Principal, on whom the bulk of the teaching work usually fell was absent in Europe on furlough so that the teaching staff consisted entirely of graduates from Indian Colleges. 15. The inadequacy of this staff was represented and in January 1905 a Conference was appointed to consider the matter and a scheme for the reorgani- zation of the Department was evolved which provides for an Imperial officer whose whole time will be devoted to College work. It was, however, necessary to obtain a man from England to fill the post and he did not arrive in time to be of any service this year. The results in the Punjab and Madras were very good and considerable improvement has taken place in Bombay. 16. There were 512 students remaining under instruction at the end of the year and 296 new students were admitted during the year as against 331 re- maining under tuition and 262 new students admitted last year. 17. The demand for Veterinary Assistants is now very great indeed, not only to fill the ranks of the Subordinate Veterinary Department, but also from the Army and other sources, and every endeavour is being made to accom- modate and turn out as many graduates as possible. The number of students has been increased by 100 in the Punjab College which is now arranging for permanent classes aggregating 250, and in Bengal 50 more men are under training. 18. Considerable attention has been devoted to the improvement of the buildings and equipment of the various Colleges and large grants of money have been made for the purpose. In the Punjab College, in the division of Surgery, the Professor has been provided with two new offices and an out- patient clinic ward, fitted with all the conveniences necessary for his work. In the division of Contagious disease and Sanitary Science, a new laboratory, lecture room and office has been provided adjoining the segregation ward and equipped with all necessary apparatus. A large lecture room and museum has been added to the main buildings and sanction has been accorded to the erection of a hostel for the accommodation of the students, new anatomical rooms, stables, dog kennels and dead house. 19. In connection with the Bengal Veterinary College, the following improvements were sanctioned by Government :4 21. The new buildings at the Madras College were completed and opened last October and the classes have since been held in them. 22. When all these improvements have been carried out, our Colleges will compare favourably with those of any other part of the world in the way of equipment and buildings, with the exception of Alfort and a few national Colleges of that stamp, and it will be well to consider the advisability of maintaining a suitable teaching staff in them. 23. The question of establishing small local research laboratories has re- ceived attention, Bengal and the Punjab being provided with suitable premises. In the latter, some research work has been carried out, but whole time patholo- gists are required for the purpose. 24. Besides the training of Veterinary Assistants, classes for Transport dressers were held at the Punjab and Bombay Colleges, 65 men being trained at the former and 30 at the latter. A Farrier's class was also held at the Punjab College and 8 trained men passed out. The question of establishing a similar class at the Bombay Veterinary College is under consideration. 25. A second edition of the text book on Equine Medicine, in Urdu, was completed by Major Pease and the Urdu Indian Veterinary Journal issued monthly from the Punjab Veterinary College during the year. A journal of Tropical Veterinary Science is also now issued from this College by Major Pease, Captain Baldrey and Mr. Montgomery. 26. From the above remarks it will be seen that extraordinary progress has been made in the development of veterinary education in all Provinces during the year. This is a matter for congratulation, as the better trained our Veterinary Assistants are the more satisfactory will be the results of their em- ployment in the districts. II.-TREATMENT OF DISEASE. Contagious disease amongst solipeds, out- breaks, morta- lity, etc. 27. Table II shows the reported mortality from the contagious diseases therein named in the various districts under this Department. The Army Remount Department deal with all cases of contagious disease among equines in the districts selected for horse breeding under their Department and we have no record of them. 28. The returns are as reliable as it is possible for us to make them at present, but represent only cases which have been brought to the notice of officers of the Department. As the supervising and executive staff is at present very small indeed and much below requirements in all provinces and the equine population very sparse in the rural districts, it is obvious that the numbers given do not in any way represent the total mortality from the diseases mentioned. I think, however, that some improvement has been effected in the system of reporting outbreaks in provinces where the Department has made some headway. In other places, where, owing to the inadequacy of the staff, no assistance can be given, reports are naturally not often sent in. 29. Glanders.5 disease is not yet decided, but Dr. Lingard considers that the organism is pro- bably an attenuated form of the Bacillus mallei. 31. Anthrax and Surra.6 This is interesting when read with the report of the Bengal Superintendent, which shows that only 12,394 deaths from contagious disease were reported to his office from the whole of the province during the year. The fact too that 26,45,675 hides were exported from Madras alone during the year also gives some idea of the possible mortality from disease in the country. The executive and supervising staff is so infinitesimal in many provinces that we are scarcely able to touch the fringe of the work, and the agency employed for the collec- tion of statistics, although the best that can at present be devised, is extremely unsatisfactory Reports are submitted by non-professional men who are generally incapable of diagnosing disease and consequently it is impossible even to classify the outbreaks reported under their proper headings. I think, however, while admitting the unreliable nature of the figures supplied, that some improvement in reporting has taken place during the year; slight, it must be acknowledged, but still an advance in the right direction. The outbreaks reported have been more than the Departmental staff could attend to and deal with. The progressive increase in the number of the subordinate aud supervising staff and the improve- ment which is gradually taking place in organisation will, year by year, improve our methods and capabilities of obtaining information of and dealing with outbreaks of contagious disease. 36. Table III shows the number of outbreaks which it has been possible for the staff to deal with by protective inoculation. It also this year contains a record of the reported number of deaths which occurred in the uninoculated cattle in the outbreaks in which protective inoculation was undertaken excepting in the case of Burma and Madras. 37. Protective inoculations against Rinderpest were carried out in all provinces except Sind, Rajputana and Baluchistan; against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia in the United Provinces, Punjab, Madras and North-West Frontier Province; and against Anthrax in the United Provinces, Madras and Assam. 38. Rinderpest accounted for 137,233, or more than half the total num- ber of deaths from contagious disease reported, against 92,090 head last year. The greatest mortality occurred in Burma where 91,380 head are reported to have perished despite the efforts made by the Department to deal with it. Segregation and inoculation were adopted whenever possible, but the Burman has not yet realized the advantages of the serum and is apparently too apathetic to bother about having his animals treated. The difficulties experienced in travelling about the country, in certain seasons, are very great and prevent assistance arriving in time to be of much use. It was found possible, however, to perform serum injections in Myingyan, Kyaukse and Yamethin in Upper Burma. Pegu and Toungoo in Lower Burma. The total number of animals inoculated with good results in 118 villages being 6,335. No spontaneous applications for preventive inoculation have, however, been made by the people. It is hoped that by gradually carrying on inoculations in various convenient areas, the people will come to understand that the serum is useful in saving their animals. There has been a slight increase in the number inoculated, as only 2,727 were done last year. 39. The disease was particularly prevalent and severe in the Southern Shan States. The cattle being hill animals are extremely susceptible and the disease, introduced from the West spread eastwards at a terrific pace appearing to go right through the country and come back on its course, attacking those villages which it had missed on its first onslaught. Segregation proved futile and the animals died faster than they could be devoured by dogs and vultures or buried by the people. 67,697 animals are reported to have perished. 40. Upper Burma also suffered to a very considerable extent, especially in the dry zone, in Minbu, Pakokku, Myingyan and Yamethin districts. 41. In Bengal the disease is reported to have been prevalent throughout the province, causing 9,023 deaths. The districts chiefly suffering loss were Burdwan, Darjeeling, Shahabad, Sonthal Parganahs, Balasore, Ranchi, Pala- mau, Manbhum and Sambhalpur. It is remarked that serious outbreaks were not reported, in many cases, to the Superintendent and that the machinery employed for the collection of statistics has been found insufficient to ensure
7 even approximate accuracy. 192 outbreaks were attended and 22,613 cattle inoculated by the serum alone method ; the number of animals which died after inoculation being 166. 42. In the Central Provinces, 8,886 cattle are reported to have died from Rinderpest. The greatest mortality was in Balaghat where 4,608 head were lost. 791 died in Seoni and 619 in Bhandara. The Deputy Commissioner of Balaghat, however, states that the disease was at least three times as severe as the figures would show and the Superintendent remarks that this is also the case in other districts. Considerable mortality amongst cattle is reported to have occurred in the Betul district where no Veterinary Assistant was em- ployed and no help could be given. Considerable progress has, however, been made in the reporting of outbreaks and in inoculation work. Last year, only 3,770 inoculations were performed whilst this year 582 outbreaks were attended and 12,460 animals received serum treatment, and only 12 deaths occurred among inoculated animals. Owing to lack of staff, many outbreaks could not be attended by Veterinary Assistants. 43. In Madras, the number of deaths reported is 19,050 The number of outbreaks is not shown but the Superintendent reports that the mortality was severe in Ganjam, Godavery, Nellore, Kistna, Kurnool, Bellary, Anantpur, South Arcot and Madura. The staff is very small and he could only arrange satisfactorily for inoculation work to be carried out in Ganjam, Godavery and Nellore. None was done in the remaining districts with the exception of Anantpur, Kurnool and South Arcot. 130 outbreaks were attended and 12,689 cattle inoculated. 44. In the Punjab, rinderpest prevailed to a greater extent and the morta- lity from it is higher than last year. 4,155 deaths are reported against 997 last year. The increase in the numbers is accounted for by improved reporting and increase in subordinate staff. 166 outbreaks were attended and 49,5 9 cattle and 709 sheep and goats were inoculated; the mortality among inoculated animals being shown as only 42. 45. In the North-West Frontier Province, the disease appeared in the Peshawar and Bannu districts and a severe outbreak occurred in the Kurrum Valley, where 667 deaths are reported. In all, 2,056 cases occurred, of which 910 died. The Political Officer interested himself in the suppression of the Kurrum Valley outbreak and the Veterinary Inspector of the Bannu district took energetic measures in the shape of inoculation. Recrudescence of disease occurred owing to the traffic in cattle from across the border, but each out- break was dealt with as soon as it was discovered. A serious outbreak occurred in the Peshawar district but the disease was successfully dealt with by the staff. 55 outbreaks were attended and 15,116 cattle inoculated, the mortality in inoculated animals being reported to be 18. The Superintendent reports that there is no doubt that the serum inoculation successfully combated several severe outbreaks which otherwise nothing could have been done to stop. 46. In the United Provinces, the disease is reported to have been less, prevalent than last year, 1,686 deaths only being reported against 3,798 last year. It occurred in 22 districts against 30 last year, but the. outbreaks were reported to be slight. 60 outbreaks were attended and 5,814 animals inoculated; of which, 54 died. 47. The disease appeared in the Bombay Presidency during the year, having been introduced by grazing cattle into the Sholapur and Ahmednagar districts, whence it spread to Bombay and Thana. The Superintendent reports that it will certainly extend. Every endeavour was made to check the spread of the disease at the commencement of the outbreak but without success, partly on account of the inadequacy of the staff available and partly on account of the opposition of the people to the measures recommended. They showed great unwillingness to have their animals inoculated and in most cases flatly refused to permit it. In 2 outbreaks, 89 cattle were inoculated. Considering that the inoculation is something quite new to the majority of the cattle owners of the Presidency and, as is always the case with new measures, they are distrustful
8 of it, it is satisfactory that even so small a beginning has been made. We may hope that when they begin to see the benefit of the measures, all opposition will disappear as has occurred in other parts of India. It is feared, however, that the failure to avail themselves of the serum treatment will, in the present out- break, cost them dear. The Veterinary Inspector of Assam attended 31 outbreaks and inoculated 3,905 head of cattle. 48. Anthrax.9 centres in Bombay were Nasik, Dharwar and Ratnagiri. In the Central Provinces10 tality from 10 or 12 per cent. to ½ to 1 per cent., and recent reports show that the dread disease is rapidly disappearing. Similar results have been obtained in New Zealand. Funds have been provided for the purchase of a sufficient quantity of Blacklegoids next year and arrangements are being made for a regular fresh supply. Steps are being taken in the Punjab and United Provinces to ascertain, so far as possible, in what villages the disease is enzootic with a view to the young cattle being protected against the disease. Previous experience with this form of inoculation in India has been very favourable. The method was popular and easy of application and I have no doubt that very great benefit will result from the attempt now being made. The Imperial Bacteriologist has been employed in experiments with a view to the production of a suitable vaccine and experi- mental use in the field will probably be attempted next year. In order to be successful, it must be a vaccine capable of conferring immunity by a single in- oculation preferably and in the same form as Blacklegoids. 61. Other contagious diseases.11 and mouth disease during the year. In Burma, the falling off is explained by the great prevalence of rinderpest and the urgent necessity which existed for the employment of the Veterinary Assistants in arranging for and attending to the segregation of animals during outbreaks. 65. There is an increase in the number of castrations performed,12 Eastern Bengal, and Bombay. In Bengal and Madras they work at a loss at present and in Burma no fees are taken. They are of the greatest value and will gradually be increased in numbers as money becomes available. Stud bulls and their produce. III.13 ducted by the Gujarat Cattle Preservation Society under the presidency of the Commissioner, Northern Division. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary De- partment, is adviser to the Association on matters connected with breeding and management; and it is under the management of a graduate of the Bombay Veterinary College. The breeding stock consists of 7 bulls and 216 cows and a total of 564 head, of which 286 is young female stock. It has been suggested that the Chharodi herd should be removed to a more suitable district near Deesa. In Bombay, land in the vicinity of Sholapur was taken over from the Forest Department for the purpose of opening a cattle breeding farm, but after con- sideration the scheme has been dropped. 77. In the United Provinces, a site has been selected by the Superinten- dent near Lakhimpur (Kheri district) for a bull breeding depôt and the matter is under consideration. It is also proposed to maintain a herd of pure Khairi- garh cattle at the Peagpur estate in the Bahraich district. The proposal to establish Bull rearing farms in Bengal has been dropped for the present. 78. A revised scheme for a bull breeding farm neay Sargodha, at an initial outiay of Rs. 1,29,809, has been generally approved by the Punjab Government. The grazing rights in the Dreema rukh near Sargodha have been applied for. When the site is sanctioned, operations will be commenced and hopes are entertained that in time 50 bulls, suitable to the Northern dis- tricts, will be issued annually. (2) EQUINES (UNDER LOCAL BODIES). 79. Horse, pony and mule breeding in non-selected districts suitable for the purpose form a very important duty of the Department. When the Horse- Breeding Commission recommended the transfer of all Military breeding operations to the Military Department, only certain districts of those in which the branding of mares and provision of stallions had been in force, were con- sidered to be sufficiently suitable to warrant the considerable expense which necessarily attends them. Thus, numerous districts which had previously been within the scope of the operations, were suddenly cut adrift; some of them contained considerable numbers of branded mares and mares for mule- breeding, but owing to Government stallions always having been provided, there were practically no private stallions kept by the people. It has been found necessary therefore to provide as many horses as were required from the Civil side, partly from District Board funds and partly from Provincial revenues, with the assistance of grants from the Government of India. In this way a number of horse and pony stallions have been placed in the districts and are doing good work. 80. The provision of donkeys for mule breeding for which many of our districts are very suitable has, however, not been so easy a matter on account of the difficulty which has been experienced in purchasing suitable sires. Many of the donkeys we have at present employed in the districts are those which were not selected by the Remount Department and are becoming too old and worn out for work. The subject of replacing them is under consideration and it is hoped that a satisfactory solution of the difficulty may be arrived at and the jacks be procurable, as the mule breeding industry is one of very great import- ance both from an industrial and a military point of view. 81. These breeding operations can be carried out very cheaply by the Department if we continue on the lines at present in force, as they entail the entertainment of no extra staff for the collection of statistics, and the work is carried on side by side with the other veterinary duties of the districts. When the projected Subordinate Veterinary staff is available and sufficient Imperial Officers appointed, it will be easier than at present and the inspection of stallion stands, etc., will be as much a matter for attention as the cattle and other breeding operations being carried on in the same area. 82. The present method of providing stallions leaves a good deal to be desired. Provincial Governments and the Government of India have done a good deal to supply such needs as have been represented, but it is believed
14 that in some provinces, the United Provinces for instance, the services of con- siderably greater number of stallions could be usefully utilised if the question of their maintenance could be more satisfactorily settled. At present, District Boards cannot provide the necessary funds and although darindahs and owners are continually applying for more stallions, they cannot be supplied owing to there being no funds to keep them. It is also noted that some District Boards in the Punjab have not the funds necessary to replace stallions which have died and the operations consequently cease in such places. Horse, pony- and donkey stal- lions. 83. Table X gives the number of horse, pony and donkey stallions under Local Bodies in non-selected districts. There were 54 horses, 111 ponies and 70 donkeys present at the end of the year. Of these, 35 horses, 49 ponies and 7 donkeys were in the districts of the United Provinces ; 5 horses, 55 ponies and 54 donkeys in the Punjab ; 8 horses, 10 ponies and 9 donkeys in the North-West Fróntier Province ; 6 horses and 12 ponies in Bombay; 15 ponies in Madras; and 4 ponies in Burma. 84. In Bombay, the number of stallions actually employed at stud work during the year was 16.33 against 12.94 in the previous year, and the number of mares covered was 571. No records of results are collected. 85. In the United Provinces, 43 Provincial stallions and 3 others were at stud work and covered 2,618 mares against 2,179 last year. The District Board stallion at Sultanpur covered 26 mares and the private stallion 13 mares. The average number of mares covered per stallion is 56.9 against 56.1 last year. The results of last year's coverings by Provincial stallions are excellent, the average being 48.6 per cent. of mares covered. The 5 donkeys actually em- ployed covered 237 mares, an average of 47.4 against 47.5 last year. 86. Pony breeding is still carried on in Madras. 11 stallions out of 15 were at work, the average coverings being 28 against 27 last year. The Superintendent reports that the average result of coverings is annually im- proving. 87. In the Punjab, a standard scale has been fixed at 3 horses, 59 ponies and 68 donkeys for the province. Last year, a sum of Rs. 36,00015 50.2 against 52 last year. 64 donkeys covered 3,973 mares against 70 and 4,729, respectively, or 62 per cent. against 67.5 last year. Many of the donkeys are old and should be replaced as soon as possible. Altogether the services of stallions appear to have been best utilized in the Punjab, North-West Frontier Province and United Provinces, where there is undoubtedly much good to be done by maintaining stallions under District Boards or Provincial Governments. As stated last year, these operations are conducted as cheaply as possible, no unnecessary staff being maintained for the collection of statistics, and the securing of the services of the animals is attended with as little trouble as possible to the people. The Superintendent, North-West Frontier Province, is now arranging to collect statistics of results. If this can be done with but little extra work and no increase in establishment, no harm will be done, but I do not consider it a step in the right direction. There can be no doubt whatever as to the usefulness of the stallions in the districts and we shall not improve the results by trying to estimate them accurately. If any proof be wanted, we may turn to the results obtained by the Provincial stallions in the United Provinces, which are reported to be as follows:16 the demand which exists for them from other sources, must be regarded as satisfactory. There is a slight increase all round except in Burma where owing to casualties having occurred and there being no men available to fill the vacancies so produced, 3 men less than last year have been employed. Some provinces are still very backward, Madras with only 15 men for the whole Province for instance. Bombay is also very short-handed and the same is the case in regard to Eastern Bengal and Assam. The Madras College will, how- ever, turn out some graduates next year and these will doubtless be employed to fill vacancies. The Punjab College is making special efforts to supply more graduates as are also Bengal and Bombay. Various provinces have submitted schemes for the reorganization of their Veterinary Departments which provide for considerable numbers of Inspectors and Veterinary Assistants and in many cases Deputy Superintendents. These schemes will be gradually carried out as men become available. In some provinces, the Punjab for instance, more would have been obtained had the terms offered been as good as those in other provinces and Departments. This matter has been represented and will no doubt shortly be rectified. Naturally the staff at present employed is totally inade- quate for the work and our operations are greatly hampered by the want of qualified men, so that we cannot seriously attack the various problems to be dealt with. Improvement in this direction must be gradual and we must devote our best attention to the Schools in order to get good men turned out in as great numbers as possible. The veterinary assistants at present employed are working either in dispensaries, hospitals, at inoculation work in the districts, or in Colleges and Schools. 95. The Superintendents have reported very well on the work performed generally by the subordinate staff and it is satisfactory to note that an improve- ment in discipline and efficiency is taking place. When Superintendents' char- ges are made small enough to be workable and to allow of their imparting practical instruction to the subordinate staff in the field, we may hope to see a very marked improvement in their knowledge of disease and useful- ness. PART B.-IMPERIAL ADMINISTRATION. BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY. 96. Doctor A. Lingard, Imperial Bacteriologist, remained in charge of the Laboratory throughout the year, and as usual, work was carried out both at the central Laboratory at Muktesar and at the branch at Bareilly. There have again been unavoidable changes in the staff, Mr. Montgomery, Assistant Bacteriologist, being replaced by Mr. Martin. The work has, however, been carried on successfully. Owing to the great increase in the work, necessitated by the preparation of the various sera now sent out from the Laboratory, it has been found necessary to appoint a second Assistant Bacteriologist, and applica- tion has also been made for the services of a third European Laboratory Assis- tant. Neither of these joined during the year. Some necessary additions have been made to the establishment, and sanction has been given for the appoint- ment of a Hospital Assistant to take charge of a new dispensary which is being built for the treatment of the staff. 97. The water supply scheme has been completed, and the 8 H. P. Engine and centrifugal machine has been removed from the branch at Bareilly to the central Laboratory, and it is hoped, will be in position shortly. 98. Plans and estimates for new buildings have been submitted, and when these are completed, they will greatly improve the utility of the Laboratory. 99. The arrangements made for fodder have been so far satisfactory, but owing to increase in the number of animals, it has been found necessary to obtain more land for fodder production, and proposals for doing so are now under consideration.
17 100. The following papers were published by Doctor A. Lingard, the Im- perial Bacteriologist, during the year under report :18 method of protecting animals against Charbon Symptomatique; a large number of doses of various vaccines have been prepared and will be issued for testing in the field during the coming wet season. Mallein was also prepared. 105. There has been a very great increase in the amount of serum prepared 11,98,569 c.c. against 8,13,352 c.c. of anti-rinderpest serum, an increase of 3,85,217 c.c. : 2,25,310 c.c. of Anthrax serum against 1,37,355 c.c. or an increase of 87,955 c.c. and 75,350 c.c. of anti-Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia serum, as well as 3,407 c.c. of Mallein. A total of 15,02,636 c.c. in all. 106. Rinderpest.19 doses in excess of last year, and 18,647 greater than that of the year before. The returns show the following results :20 As the Department extends and inoculation work develops, the demand for this serum will, doubtless, increase greatly. 113. Mallein.21 122. The experiments with sera produced by hyper-immunizing bovines with organic substances other than the casual agent of Hæmorrhagic Septi- cæmia, have been continued and some progress is reported especially with serum produced by hyper-immunization with milk products. 123. Experiments have been continued with a view to protecting equines from or curing them of Surra, but so far without any practical result. In regard to the treatment of equine Surra a series of experiments which were commenced during last year, which had for their object the cure of the disease by the administration of arsenic and trypanrot were continued. Two out of five Country-breds treated recovered, but the remainder died, and all Austra- lian horses succumbed. The attenuation of the Trypanosoma by means of culture by the new, improved methods devised by workers in other parts of the world, was attempted, but the experiments were not so successful as could have been desired. 124. It has been shown that doses of arsenic and trypanrot well tolerated by equines proved lethal to camels in a few hours. Two-thirds of the doses were tolerated, but failed to cure camel Surra. 125. Equine Surra has been found to be inoculable to the Black Buck ; the degree of susceptibility of this animal varies, but it appears that this is not capable of carrying over the Trypanosoma from the end of one Surra season to the beginning of another. Researches into camel Surra and Dourine have been continued, and a report on camel Surra will be issued later. 126. Tuberculosis has been found in the camel, and experiments are in progress to determine the identity of the organism which is said to differ con- siderably from the bacilli found in human, bovine and avian tuberculosis. A discovery having a very important bearing on the application of the Glanders and Farcy Act was made during the year. A certain number of cases of disease in equines were observed, presenting clinical symptoms closely resembling those of Glanders. The animals, however, failed to react to Mallein, and Guinea pigs inoculated by the Strauss method, did not give the typical reaction. Doctor Lingard obtained material from Bombay Veterinary College. Captain Baldrey discovered a similar organism causing a similar disease at the Punjab Veterinary College. Morphologically the bacillus obtained closely resembles the B. mallei. Care is necessary therefore in using the Mallein test in such cases. Investigation is being continued with the view to ascertaining whether the organism is B. mallei of a strain of reduced virulence or not. Altogether 101 specimens were sent to the Laboratory for report, the majority with a view to the diagnosis of Epizootic Lymphangitis or Trypanosomiasis. Reports on all specimens were made. 127. On reference to Table XV, the average cost of preparation of sera at this Laboratory is less than 8 annas a dose. Should the cost of the serum pro- duced be calculated at one rupee per dose, the price sanctioned by Government to be charged to Foreign countries, and which is only two-thirds the price charged for it in South Africa, a clear saving of Rs. 1,71,658 would have accrued to the Government of India. 128. The Laboratory work done during the year has been exceptionally heavy and successful, and reflects the greatest possible credit on the Imperial Bacteriologist and his Assistants. GOVERNMENT CATTLE FARM, HISSAR. 129. Tables XVI and XVII.22 cultivation. In addition to this, cases of Rinderpest and Foot and Mouth disease have occurred. It is very satisfactory to observe that despite these draw- backs, although the operations were rendered more expensive than they would otherwise have been, the stock did not suffer and disease was not allowed to make any great headway. The breeding herd consisted of 889 cows and 19 bulls, the number of calves born being only 480 against 620 last year, the percentage is, however, satisfactory, the last year's results being somewhat exceptional. Forty-five inferior old cows were weeded out of the herd and sold, 4 died and 2 were destroyed, whilst 111 heifers were added. The herd at the close of the year therefore numbered 889 against 828 last year. The Superin- tendent hopes to bring the herd up to 1,000 by the end of next year. There were 817 young female stock present at the close of the year, and 661 male stock. The herd is gradually improving and becoming more even year by year and satisfactory weeding has been adopted during the year. We are producing stock the like of which cannot be obtained in the open market. 131. Sixty-six Ordnance mules were supplied, and thirty-one bulls sold to the Punjab for work in the districts. There has been considerable demand for bulls from the Farm, for other parts of India, and applications have been received for them from America and Jamaica. The bullocks supplied to the army were so good that the Committee paid Rs. 130 each for them, or Rs. 10 more than has ever been paid before. 132. Mules.23 137. Cultivation.24 protected against contagious disease and a start has been made in research work in the college laboratories during the year, Captain Baldrey having done good work in this direction at Lahore. 144. Finally, the important subject of camel disease investigation is receiving attention, a special officer having been appointed for the purpose and work commenced in the Punjab on the subject of camel Surra, with special reference to life history of the causal agent.
