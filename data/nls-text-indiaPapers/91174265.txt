REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1903-1904 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] MADRAS: PRINTED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT, GOVERNMENT PRESS. 1904.
OFFICE OF SANITARY COMMISSIONER, MADRAS, 11th July 1904. No. 657/V. From LIEUT.-COLONEL W. G. KING, C.I.E., I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner for Madras, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, LOCAL AND MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. SIR, I have the honour to forward, herewith, the Report on Vaccination in the Madras Presidency for the year 1903-1904 written, as usual, by the Inspector of Vaccination and Deputy Sanitary Commissioner. 2. He shows that there has been a falling off in the total number of cases when compared with last year. The decrease is accounted for in his paragraph 7. Possibly, the knowledge that the Inspector of Vaccination was engaged the greater part of the year in performing educational work and could not therefore make '' surprise visits &quot; to districts, which are of special value in gauging progress, was an additional factor. 3. In regard to the stationary condition of municipal vaccination, there is disclosed an unsatisfactory condition of affairs; in that, obviously, the ambition of vaccinators in municipal employ is solely to strive to fulfil a minimum number, whilst it matters not to them whether this consists of primary or re-vaccination operations. That these vaccinators fulfilled more primary operations during the current than in the past year is no reason for falling off in re-vaccinations4 6. Lieutenant-Colonel Bannerman, I.M.S., having been appointed Superin- tendent of the King Institute in December, an endeavour was made to push forward the Vaccine Section, so that it would be possible to commence the issue of pre- served vaccine in January. It was, however, found that, owing to various causes connected with the building, work could not be undertaken at any definite date, and, on the other hand, without giving some definite term of notice to the local bodies it was impossible for them to dispense with their existing establishments or of their contracts with the Bangalore Vaccine Institute. However, the staff necessary was gradually assembled and trained in the work required, and necessary arrangements made for the obtaining of calves, etc. But it was not until the 1st of March that any district was supplied, and by the end of the month only two districts had received vaccine from the Institute. By the 1st of April arrange- ments were made with several districts, so that within a short period the whole Presidency will derive its supply solely from this Institute. The amount issued to the two districts in question within the official year was too small to give a criterion of the value of the vaccine supplied. Under the circumstances described, it has not been thought necessary to submit any special report of the working of the Vaccine Section of the Institute. But I suggest for the consideration of Govern- ment that it would be advisable that a brief formal report written by the Superin- tendent of the King Institute in future years be submitted to it by the Sanitary Commissioner at the same time as the Vaccination Report. I may state that, as soon as Government has issued orders on the reorganization of the department, the Institute will not only serve for the issue of vaccine, but also will afford educational facilities to the members of the Vaccination Department. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, W. G. KING, Lieut-Colonel, I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner for Madras.

READNos. 918, 919 L., 2ND AUGUST 1904. 3 With reference to his complaint in paragraph 13 of the report regarding the leniency on the part of the Magistracy in dealing with persons in Unions where vacci- nation is compulsory, who fail to observe the law, the Inspector of Vaccination should bring to the notice of the District Magistrate specifically cases in which he considers that the Magistrates have been at fault. 5. From the table given in paragraph 14 of the report it appears that while the percentage of success with lymph preserved with glycerine was 95.8 in Munici- palities, it was as low as 86.9 in Local Fund areas. A similar difference also occurs in regard to lymph locally preserved with lanoline, the proportion of success- ful cases in Municipal and Local Fund areas being 95.5 and 87 per cent. respect- ively. The Inspector of Vaccination should have given some explanation of these variations, especially as the point was noticed by Government in the review of the report for the previous year. The Government trust that the King Institute of Preventive Medicine will be able to supply lymph to every District during the current year and remove all cause for complaint in regard to its quality or efficacy. 6. About 60 per cent. of the vaccine operations were verified by the Deputy Inspectors of Vaccination, but 11 of these officers failed to verify 50 per cent. of the operations in their ranges. The Inspector has held the reasons to be satisfac- tory in their case. It is difficult, however, to understand how the low percentages returned for Calicut (34), Paramagudi (38), Tiruvannamalai (41), and Cuddalore (29) could be satisfactorily explained. The District Medical and Sanitary Officers verified 2.5 per cent. of the cases during their tours of Inspection; but the amount of work done in Bellary, Kistna and Vizagapatam was insignificant. As the Inspector of Vaccination has now been relieved of his duties at the Medical College, he will be able to devote more attention to the supervision of vaccination than it was practicable for him to do in the year under review. 7. The Vaccine Section of the King Institute of Preventive Medicine com- menced to work about the end of the year and two districts were supplied with lymph in March 1904. Arrangements have been made in the current year with several districts, and it is hoped that the entire Presidency will shortly derive its supply solely from this source. As suggested by the Sanitary Commissioner, a brief report on the working of the Institute should, for the future, be submitted to the Government with the annual vaccination report. 8. The report was submitted to Government on the 18th July 1904, although it was due on the 1st idem. This delay should have been explained. (True Extract.) H. D. TAYLOR, Acting Secretary to Government.

OFFICE OF SANITARY COMMISSIONER, CAMP, COONOOR, 20th July 1905. No. 1180/V. From LIEUT.-COLONEL W. G. KING, C.I.E., I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner for Madras, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, LOCAL AND MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. SIR, I have the honour to forward herewith the Report on Vaccination in this Presidency during 1904-1905, and on the working of the King Institute of Pre- ventive Medicine. The former is written by Captain F. F. Elwes, I.M.S., Acting Inspector of Vaccination and Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, and the latter by Lieutenant S. R. Christophers, I.M.S., Superintendent of the Institute. I regret it was not possible to submit them on the correct date. This was owing to the fact that, by a misunderstanding, it was not originally intended to show the cost of vaccine. To rectify the omission, the figures of the Report were re-cast. 2. In regard to the Vaccination Report, the chief interest centres in the fact that, for the first time, the vaccinators have been supplied with preserved animal vaccine from the Vaccine Section of the King Institute. Two results are obvious : firstly, the increased outturn, namely, 90,502 successful cases in excess of the previous year and, secondly, the decreased cost of each successful case. The first is brought about by opportunities of securing vaccine being practically unlimited, as any required amount can be always sent to a vaccinator in excess of his average requirements, at the shortest notice ; the second is due to the economy with which, under normal circumstances, a large production of vaccine can be secured by a single skilled staff employed at a definite point, as compared with the use of numerous petty depots scattered throughout the Presidency. There has thus been effected, at the rate of 2 pies for each successful case, a total saving of Rs. 12,944. This diminished expenditure on the part of local bodies should go well towards their contribution for the year, on account of the prime cost of the buildings of the Vaccine Section of the Institute. 3. There is however a reverse side of the picture. In Municipalities the primary vaccination success rate has decreased from 97.0 to 94.0 per cent. and Local Fund areas from 91.0 to 86.9 per cent. Roughly judged, this would seem clear proof that the preserved vaccine supplied has been of less efficacy than the mixed methods of calf-to-arm vaccine, locally made glycerinized vaccine, locally made lanoline-vaccine, and even the use of scabs as hitherto practised. 4. To arrive at a clear judgment in this matter, it is necessary to remember that the districts were not all supplied from the commencement of the year, but that they were taken up gradually as their own contracts or other arrangements fell through, or, as, by gradual expansion, the Institute was able to meet their demands. Indeed, Tanjore was not supplied till the 1st of April 19054 strict obedience and attention to the most minute details was requisite for success, demanded both time, patience, and the experience acquired by mishaps. Holding this in mind, it is conceded that during the first few months the vaccine issued although of good virulence was not diffused in the lanoline medium employed with that skill which was requisite, and this was largely due to trusting to machinery which was ultimately abandoned. Further, certain floors of the buildings for accommodation of calves were found to be of undesirable material, and temporary makeshifts, and many contingencies arising therefrom, causing great anxiety and trouble in the process of cultiyation, had to be encountered. It is needless for me to enlarge on such matters; but I ask it to be remembered that in the management of so large a concern both the financial and professional responsibility is heavy, and that the tax upon the attention of the Superintendent who has to attend to details both in the Bacteriological and Vaccine Sections is constant. I foresaw this in my forecast of the staff, and particularly urged that as a Commissioned Medical Officer could not be afforded, the Deputy Superintendent should be of the class of an Uncovenanted Medical Officer who had undergone a European training. I remain of the opinion then expressed, after seeing the work attempted by an Assistant Surgeon from the Civil as well as from the Military Branch of the Subordinate Medical Department. What is required is the class of men with sufficient independence and initiative to be trusted with the administration of a large lunatic asylum or jail, together with a keen appreciation of the endless matters of professional interest that are encountered in the careful cultivation and preservation of vaccine. 5. If, however, difficulties were at first encountered they were ultimately overcome by Lieutenant Christophers' keen appreciation of details and determi- nation, so that it may be safely said that of nine months out of the twelve vaccine excellent in virulence, in bacterial purity, and in preservation was issued to vaccinators. But, in this Presidency, the task of successful vaccination by no means ends with the issue of good vaccine. As stated above, various methods had been formerly employed so that many of the vaccinators had never in their lives seen preserved vaccine, whilst others had never had experience of material of the consistency of lanoline-vaccine. Thus, during my tours, I have found not only vaccinators but at least one Deputy Inspector of Vaccination employing grossly incorrect methods for its utilization. In spite of the most explicit instructions that the vaccine should be carried solely in a specially constructed vac cine-carrier, vaccinators have repeatedy personally exhibited to me the vaccine carried in the postal despatch box in their pockets5 at pages 6 and 7 of his Report, where it is shown that vaccine which has been issued to vaccinators and therefore had passed through all the exigencies of exposure to tropical heat during transport in rural posts, gave successful results from 164 to 383 days in the hands of the staff, although the vaccine after receipt had been kept at room temperature in Madras (Guindy) up to date of the experiment. In judging results, it is worth remembering that although dealing with a tropical climate the Institute makes its issue of vaccine only once a fortnight to the vacci- nators, whilst, in the temperate climate of England, the Local Government Board think so little of the power of glycerine to preserve vaccine at ordinary temperature, that it demands that every tube not used by public vaccinators within seven days of its issue shall be returned by them. In connection with the efficacy of lanoline in withstanding the influence of a tropical climate, I may state that Colonel Benson, I.M.S., has informed me of the successful production of five vesicles on a human being and one vesicle in a calf, with a specimen that had been made in the Mysore Government Institute as far back as 1901. As soon as vaccinators hare been properly trained therefore and discipline in districts as to use of the vaccine is enforced, I see no reason to doubt that the rate of success as well as the financial cost will show improvement. This is sufficiently shown by Captain Elwes's para- graph 13, which proves that the rate has differed with districts or, in other words, with the experience of use of lanoline vaccine. That this is an important factor, I showed clearly in my experimental issue in 1890-1891 when the total rate of success rose right through the hot weather from 92.96 per cent. in the first Quarter to 93.96 in the second and 96.04 in the third. 7. The question of elimination of &quot; extraneous organisms &quot; has not been lost sight of, although I am by no means disposed to regard the subject with the extravagant zeal exhibited by certain European authorities. It has been shown by Dr. Srinivasa Rao, Bacteriologist to the Mysore Government, that lanoline has a distinct inimical influence upon such organisms, although this has been contested by other bacteriologists. But the whole subject, as stated by the Superintendent, in his paragraph 13, will be thoroughly threshed out. Certainly, the principles adopted in the Institute of attempting in all matters high bacterial cleanliness seems to me what should be the leading feature both in the cultivation and preservation of vaccine. In this connection, I may point to a simple experiment conducted by Lieutenant Christophers at my request as to results of using a loopful of sterile water and glycerine mixture (the usual 50 per cent. employed for preservation) on the arm in six mock vaccination operations. Full precautions were taken as to preliminary cleansing of the arm. Yet, from the small portions recovered in each case there were grown from 32 colonies to 21,300 colonies of microbes. When it is remembered that in the elimination of &quot; extraneous organisms &quot; it is not anticipated that the spore-bearing will be destroyed, the whole process seems me to require considerably less enthusiasm and better elucidation of its actual merits. In this connection, I may state that the Institute offered each district the choice of glycerine or lanoline and that, without exception, they chose lanoline. There is however no intention of limiting the production to any form. Local authorities are at liberty to obtain their vaccine preserved by any recognized method. 8. The matter of better organization of the Vaccination Department which I hoped would have been decided by this time is still under consideration by Government6 10. It is a matter for regret that it has not yet been possible, owing to certain questions as to equipment being still before Government, to open the Serum Section for which suitable buildings are already in existence, but it is hoped the next Report will bear evidence of advance in this respect. 11. In the matter of education, the Institute is also fulfilling useful functions. Sanitary Assistants to District Medical and Sanitary Officers are, at the time of my writing, received for instruction in practical bacteriology. They will especially be taught to apply themselves to the elucidation of causes of disease, and to exhibit discretion in the direction of personal research and the supply of material for investigation by the Superintendent. 12. During the year, 49 candidates who had already qualified as Certificated Sanitary Inspectors underwent a five months' course in Minor Sanitary Engineer- ing under Mr. Hormusji Nowroji, A.M.I.C.E. Of these 35 passed the qualifying examination. These candidates also received, as a voluntary matter, instruction from Lieutenant Christophers in certain bacteriological details and the methods of making blood films, packing of specimens and the like. 13. Accommodation has been furnished to Assistant Surgeon Pinto, who is about to conduct physiological experiments as to snake venom. Two private practitioners and one Commissioned Medical Officer have availed themselves of the Bacteriological Laboratory set apart for the use of qualified applicants, but it is hoped more will in future utilize it. It is obvious that in this Institute young Medical Officers on first joining the service would find excellent opportunities for research, and whilst thus gaining knowledge would form a valuable aid to the Superintendent in undertaking definite branches of research under his guidance. 14. I have much exceeded the limits of an ordinary covering letter to a Report, but I trust Government will find an excuse for this fact in that it is desir- able to at least afford explanation on certain pointsREPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1904-1905. From Captain F. F. ELWES, M.B., I.M.S., Acting Inspector of Vaccination and Deputy Sanitary Commissioner for Madras, to the Sanitary Commissioner for Madras, dated 4th July 1905, No. 1041-V. I have the honour to submit the annual report on vaccination in the Madras Presidency for 1904-1905 which includes a review of the past three years. 2. The post of Inspector of Vaccination and Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, in conjunction with the Professorship of Hygiene and Bacteriology at the Medical College, was held by Captain J. W. Cornwall, I.M.S., from April 1st to July 31st and by Lieutenant S. R. Christophers, I.M.S., in addition to his duties as Superin- tendent of the King Institute of Preventive Medicine from August 1st to October 5th, Lieutenant T. Harley, I.M.S., acted as Inspector of Vaccination and Deputy Sanitary Commissioner from October 6th to December 11th, whilst the post of Inspector of Vaccination and Deputy Sanitary Commissioner again combined with the Professorship of Hygiene and Bacteriology at the Medical College has been held by me from December 12th, 1904, to March 31st, 1905. 3. The following statement shows the strength of establishment employed during the last three years with the pay of each post:8 VACCINATION REPORT. 6. The districts which show the largest increase are Malabar (26,818), Madura (18,825), Trichinopoly (15,862), Tinnevelly (15,776), Kistna (12,441), Ganjám (10,091), Cuddapah (9,865), Guntúr (9,674), Vizagapatam (7,670), Nellore (7,383), Kurnool (5,445), South Arcot (5,296), North Arcot (4,371), Bellary (3,696), Coim- batore (2,134), South Canara (1,675), and Anantapur (1,627). The increase is due to (1) the ample supply of lanoline paste from the King Institute of Preventive Medicine, (2) the raising of the minimum of second and third-class vaccinators to that of first-class vaccinators as per G.O., No. 185-M., dated 29th January 1904, and (3) the exertion of vaccinators lest they should lose their appointments. Three dis- tricts show a decrease, viz., Salem (2,038), Gódávari (1,530) and Tanjore (1,136). The explanations of decrease offered by the Deputy Inspectors of these three districts are given below :VACCINATION REPORT. 9 The fall in the percentage of success during the year under review is accounted for in paragraph 13. 8. The following districts show the largest increase in infantile vaccination when compared with the previous year . Kurnool (10.9), Nellore (10.0), Cuddapah (9.9), Bellary (9.6), Ganjám (8.5), Nilgiris (8.0) and Tinnevelly (6.4). The increase is accounted for by (1) the introduction of compulsory vaccination, (2) correct maintenance of unprotected lists, and (3) granting of rewards. The districts showing decrease are Coimbatore (5.3), South Arcot (5.3) and Vizaga- patam (1.8). The reasons for the decrease are (1) prevalence of plague, (2) careless handling of lanoline paste by vaccinators who have not received sufficient training and (3) unwillingness of people to get their children vaccinated. 9. As regards municipalities, 33 towns secured a ratio of 75 per cent. and upwards against 41 in the previous year. The towns showing the largest increase are Cannanore (17.6), Coimbatore (16.6), Conjeeveram(16.0), Chidambaram (12.7), Anantapur (10.7) and Coonoor (10.3). 10. The following table shows the cost of the various establishments and the cost of each successful case :10 VACCINATION REPORT. 13. The percentage of success obtained by the use of different kinds of lymph in primary and secondary vaccinations (re-vaccination omitted) is compared in the following table:VACCINATION REPORT. 11 17. The total number of Deputy Inspectors of Vaccination rose from 59 to 60 this year, as an additional Deputy Inspector has been appointed to the Madura district. Of these 34 are certificated sanitary inspectors. Four Deputy Inspectors retired, one was suspended, and nineteen were fined for carelessness. 18. During the year the vaccination work in fourteen municipal towns and in the Trichinopoly Range was inspected, but it is impossible for the Inspector of Vaccination to tour during nine months of the year, for his duties as Professor of Hygiene and Bacteriology at the Medical College necessitate his remaining in Madras during the College sessions. 19. The service books of all Deputy Inspectors of Vaccination have been brought up to date. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, F. F. ELWES, Captain, I.M.S., Ag. Inspector of Vaccination and Dy. Sanitary Commissioner for Madras.
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31ST MARCH 1905. THE VACCINE SECTION. 1. The total amount of vaccine despatched during the year has been 1,478,448 cases. Of this amount 1,308,035 cases were supplied to the various districts of the Madras Presidency. For various reasons, it was not found possible to take up from the beginning all the districts, which it was intended the Institute should eventually supply. A great deal had to be done in training the staff in work, with which most of them were imperfectly, if at all, acquainted. After a start was made, difficulties arose on account of the necessity, on technical grounds, of re- laying the floors of certain of the sheds with stone instead of cement. It was necessary, also, to arrange for the abolition of local vaccine depots, whilst at the same time the certainty of the new supply was assured. Anantapur, South Canara, Nilgiris, Kurnool, Nellore, Bellary, Ganjám, Ganjám Hill Tracts, Madura, Trichi- nopoly, Salem, Coimbatore, Kistna, Tinnevelly, and Vizagapatam, were however all taken up by 16th April. North and South Arcot by the 21st June. Gódávari, Chingleput, Cuddapah and Malabar by the 5th August. The only district not supplied in the current year was Tanjore. In this case every endeavour was made to start the supply of vaccine within the current year, but arrangements as regards the abolition of the local depot prevented this being carried out before April 1905. 2. In addition to vaccine supplied to the districts, in accordance with the regular supply stipulated upon, 104,918 cases were sent in answer to extra indents from vaccinators, 91,990 to different municipalities, 71,152 to Government officers including Agency vaccinators, Jails and Police, 1,063 to the Military Department, and 6,208 cases to various private persons. 3. When in the later months all these districts were supplied, the output of vaccine was at the rate of over a million and-a-half cases per annum, or practically double that of the National Vaccine Institution, hitherto the largest Institution of the kind in the world, which in 1902-1903 manufactured 800,100 cases. 4. The total net cost of production, including establishment charges and repairs of buildings, was Rs. 31,945-5-2, and the cost per case 4.1661 pies. Table I, appended, shows details of expenditure for the year. The vehicle used for the preservation of the vaccine pulp was left to the choice of the districts, who have unanimously chosen Lanoline Vaccine Paste on account of its excellent keeping qualities in the tropics, as compared with Glycerinated Lymph. Table II, appended, shows the result of a number of successful inoculations on the calf of pastes returned from the vaccinators, which had been subjected to the usual exi- gencies of rural postal transit, and which had been retained at room temperature in the Institute for variable and considerable periods. The amount of paste allowed per case was 25 millegrammes, but owing to the representations of some of the vaccinators, supported by certain of the District Medical and Sanitary officers, the amount was increased to 27 millegrammes. This latter quantity has been found, by experiment, and by the general experience of the vaccinators, to be sufficient. 5. In order that the Institute should be kept informed as to the result of vaccination in the case of the different issues of paste, vaccinators were requested through the Presidents of the District Boards to submit fortnightly statements, showing the result derived from each supply of paste. These returns, though incomplete, have served to gauge the general success of the paste. In the early months of the year very bad results were obtained. This was partly due to certain 4
14 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY. difficulties in manufacture, and it is believed to the use of a machine for mixing the pulp. By means of the records it was, however, evident that the results were largely due to carelessness, or want of skill, on the part of certain vaccinators, as was shown by comparing their work with that of better class vaccinators who gave, with the same paste, steady good returns. As a rule, also, good and often excellent results were obtained from the inoculation of calves with pastes returned from the vaccinators, although these, by the time they had reached the Institute, had undergone the extra exposure resulting from the double journey. Table III, appended, gives the results of the inoculation on the calf of returned pastes made during the year. Several specific complaints as to the quality of the paste were received, notably from Tinnevelly. These complaints referred especially to the paste supplied in the early months of the year, and are accounted for by the factors mentioned. With increased attention to manufacture, and by notifying to the District Medical and Sanitary officers glaring cases of carelessness, on the part of vaccinators, the percentage of success rose very considerably and maintained the higher rate through the year. Table IV, appended, gives the percentage of success as shown by results returned to the Institute during the current year. Table V shows the high percentage which was obtained in the district of Malabar, where the vaccinators were well accustomed to the form of vaccine issued. In referring to certain difficulties which have been encountered, it may be remarked that, although there are obvious and very great advantages accruing from the production of vaccine in a large central institution, where its purity and character can be maintained under expert supervision, there are also many difficul- ties peculiar to manufacture, on the scale and under the pressure, necessarily maintained in such a case. The difficulty of procuring the necessarily large number of suitable animals, the degree of supervision necessitated in keeping these in the requisite condition of fitness, above all the continuous work of the Section, which cannot for obvious reasons be relaxed for a single day or night, and the maintenance of a multiplicity of technical details, inattention to which inevitably results in speedy disaster, require from the staff an exceptional amount of unremitting attention. It is not surprising, therefore, that one of the greatest difficulties has been to obtain men at the same time efficient and capable of bearing the strain. Particularly difficult has been the procuring of a Deputy, who can relieve the Superintendent in some degree of details of manufacture and leave him freer for the proper functions required of him. In this respect mention may be made of the services of Assistant Superintendent Hanumantha Rao, who, during the prolonged absence of any deputy, performed many of his duties and who, since then, has been given increased responsibility as Senior Assistant Superintendent without extra remuneration. THE BACTERIOLOGICAL SECTION. 6. Work in this Section commenced in August 1904 when the laboratories were first available for occupation. 7. The first step taken was the institution of a department for reporting upon specimens sent in by medical men and others from the districts. In the earlier months of the year the number of such specimens received was not above 3 per mensem. Believing that the Institute could be made of much greater utility to medical officers than they were aware of, a pamphlet, entitled &quot; Aims and objects of the King Institute of Preventive Medicine,&quot; setting forth what it was hoped might be done on these lines, was circulated. The effect of this pamphlet was to raise the number of specimens received to an average of about 60 per mensem. In all 489 reports dealing with over 600 specimens have been sent out. The specimens have embraced a considerable variety of material and may be classified as follows:REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY. 15 were inoculated; 16 specimens of suspected rabid material, in connection with which 5 post mortems on dogs were undertaken, and 16 rabbits inoculated; 47 specimens for the Widal reaction; 53 specimens of tumours or other tissues for sectioning. In this case a specimen stained and mounted was always furnished to the officer concerned for information. 102 specimens of mosquitoes, mosquito larvæ, and flies. A smaller number of specimens of a miscellaneous nature, such as urine, vomit, fæces, specimens of parasitic worms, tetanus, leprosy, etc. During the progress of the work, a new protozoan parasite of considerable scientific interest was discovered in a species of field rat, a new species of bilhartzia ovum noted, and the presence of human ticks in India ascertained for the first time. 8. As it is impossible, owing to the high degree of specialism at present existing in the different branches of research, for a limited staff to give an adequate opinion on all matters relating to tropical medicine, measures have been taken to keep in touch with similar institutions elsewhere. In this respect the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine have been particularly helpful, from the thoroughness with which they have gone into any matter referred to them. 9. Whilst the department was intended primarily for the examination of specimens sent in, it has, as far as lay in its power, given every facility possi- ble to those officers who wished to do this work themselves. Stains, especially Romanowskis stain, but also others have been sent to those asking for them, at the cost price of the materials used. Such apparatus as entomological pins, collecting tubes and slides have been supplied on the same basis. With the exception of Kasauli, it is not known that any similar department exists in the tropics. In addition to such work as the above, which has special reference to medical officers, much has been done in the examination of material for public health purposes. The examination of water has so far formed the most prominent feature of this section. In addition to a number of samples, systematic investigation has been made upon the conditions of the Madras water-supply, the results of which have been embodied in No. 4 of the &quot; Selected Papers of the King Institute of Preventive Medicine.&quot; 10. A few samples of sewage have been received and also milk suspected of containing typhoid bacilli. At present the adequate treatment of such matters can scarcely be carried out, though it is hoped much more may be done, when the recently appointed Assistants are well acquainted with bacteriological methods. 11. A few samples sent by private persons have been reported upon, when they appeared to relate to the public health, or were of general scientific interest. In no case either here, or in the examination of material sent by medical men, has a fee been charged. 12. During the year a good deal of work of an investigatory nature has been carried on. The chief results have been published in the following &quot; Selected Papers of the King Institute of Preventive Medicine&quot; :16 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY. mammal and its cycle of development in the louse. The results of this investigation are on the point of publication in the Scientific Memoirs. Another piece of work has been a study of the anatomy and histology of ticks especially with regard to a species of human tick found in India (Orinthodorus savignyi). This paper is also in the hands of the printer and is to be published in the Scientific Memoirs. Further work on a variety of subjects, notably a study of vaccine, has been carried on, but is not yet complete enough for publication. It is hoped that in the future, Com- missioned Medical officers will avail themselves of the Institute for work of this nature, for which there is immense scope in Madras. 14. In summing up the results of the year's work in the Bacteriological Depart- ment, it may be said that much good work has been done. At the same time it is very evident that the work is capable of enormous expansion in almost every respect..-' The specimens sent in during the present year exceeded somewhat the powers of the staff to deal with them, and in many cases regrettable delay of neces- sity arose. Efforts to arouse interest were always met with an increased number, and there can be no doubt that the interest of medical officers in the scientific aspects of their work is much helped by such an institution. The specimens sent in by different surgeons have shown that, as a rule, an enormous waste of valuable pathological material occurs, and this is accounted for by the fact, that a small minority only of the medical officers are able to examine the tumours or tissues they remove, without forwarding the material to Europe, and the payment of a considerable fee. In this way most valuable information regarding cancer and other matters is lost. 15. In the matter of public health the work that could be done, more especially in connection with the examination of water-supplies, is capable of being much increased. At first it was found impossible to do more than very incomplete examinations of samples of water sent to the Institute, and in some cases it was not possible owing to the pressure of other duties to examine the sample before this had become useless for the purpose. Since the appointment of an Assistant of good qualifications, much more thorough examinations have been possible, and as he becomes further trained, it will be possible to increase the work done. 16. Before the Section can really adequately fulfil the position it ought to occupy in the Presidency, it will require the services of a European officer, who can devote to it his whole time. THE SERUM SECTION. 17. No work has yet been done in this section, and although the buildings are now complete there are still certain essential particulars which await Government's sanction. S. R.

The Deputy Inspectors of Vaccination verified 56 per cent. of the total number of operations ; but 12 of these officers failed to verify the 50 per cent. due by them for reasons which in ten instances have been accepted by the Inspector as satisfactory. In addition, the District Medical and Sanitary Officer inspected 2.3 per cent. of the operations ; but in Bellary, Cuddapah, Ganjám, Kistna, Kurnool and Vizagapatam, the number of cases verified by these officers was less than 1 per cent. of the total number of operations. In districts where Sanitary Assistants to the District Medical and Sanitary Officer have been appointed, a large increase in the number of verifications will be looked for. In the case of other districts, the Surgeon-General is requested to impress on the officers concerned the necessity for larger verification of the work of the vaccination staff. 7. The Vaccine section of the King Institute of Preventive Medicine at Guindy which commenced work towards the close of 1903-1904 supplied lymph to all the dis- tricts in the Presidency except Tanjore during the year under report. Tanjore began to receive its lymph from the Institute from April 1905. The Government trust that as the Vaccinators become accustomed to the new kind of lymph and undergo special training in vaccination under the Deputy Inspector of Vaccination whom it is proposed to place on special duty for this purpose, the percentage of success will show an improvement. 8. The report on the scheme proposed for certain districts for the reorganization of the vaccination staff is under the consideration of Government and orders will issue shortly. The Government have lately directed that candidates for the post of Deputy Inspectors and Vaccinators may undergo a special course of training in the King Institute from 1st September next, and they have no doubt that this will be the means of further improving the quality of the work of the vaccine staff. 9. The report as to the work done in the King Institute is full and interesting and the Government congratulate Colonel King and Lieutenant Christophers on the success which has attended their efforts during the first year of its establishment. 10. The suggestion made by Colonel King that the Deputy Superintendent of the Institute who is now a Military Assistant Surgeon should be replaced by an Uncove-- nanted Medical Officer with European training should form the subject of a separate communication. 11. There has been a delay of more than a month in the submission of these reports and the explanation offered therefor in paragraph 1 of the Sanitary Commis- sioner's letter cannot be accepted as adequate.

REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1913-14. From Major W. A. JUSTICE, M.B., C.M., D.P.H., I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner for Madras, to the Secretary to Government, Local and Municipal Depart- ment, dated the 27th August 1914, No. 321/V. I have the honour to submit herewith my annual report on the working of the Vaccination Department in the Madras Presidency during the official year 1913-14. Under G.O. No. 1455, Public, dated 12th July 1886, annual statistical tables, with the briefest possible notes, for two years and a full report in the third year relating to vaccination, should be submitted to Government. Year after year, however, the report of the Inspector of Vaccination contained complete particulars, both in statistical tables and in notes, about the operations of the department in that particular year; and I propose therefore to confine my remarks in the present report mainly to the working of the department in 1913-14. 2.

With the employment of qualified vaccina- tors (i.e., sanitary inspectors with special training in vaccination in the King Institute, Guindy,) on higher rates of pay, better results may be expected. The question of improving the personnel and the pay of these staffs is at present engaging the attention of the District Boards in the Presidency. (G.O. No. 1814 L., dated 23rd October 1913.). B.

Just what caused the fall in December 1913 it is difficult to say. Usually the figures go on at this season rising steadily to a maximum, but the fall was only moderate in amount and of short dura- tion as by January there was an almost complete recovery, and February, with the actual maximum for the year, is 1.1 per cent. above last year's figure plus the annual overall improvement. This improvement was more than maintained into March which usually begins to show signs of the hot weather drop. TABLE VI.

In spite of its notable improvement this year, Coimbatore still occupies the foot of the list and is very nearly 20 per cent. worse than Bellary over the whole five years. Farthermore unless it makes a still farther improvement next year, its position will be relatively worse, since the good effects of earlier years are being eliminated. TABLE VIII.

Some observations on the production of cow-pox vaccine at The King Institute as shown by the statistics during the last decade by Captain W. S. Patton, M.B., I.M.S. As I have had the opportunity of observing the methods of making the cow-pox vaccine at this Institute from August 1905 with intervals during which I was on leave or on special duty up to the present time, it will, I think, be of some value and also of considerable interest to examine the statistics for the ten years 1904 to 1914. Unfortunately the figures for the earlier years are incomplete and those for 1906 were either not kept or have been lost. During the earlier years16 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY. TABLE II.

The reason for this is twofold. In the first place the improved technique of inserting the seed lymph in groups of triple lines results in the formation of larger and healthier vesicles ; there is a greater flow of blood to the parts and a better re-action, and the vesicles run together to form a uniform layer of lymph. In the case of the single lines in the majority of the animals the vesicles remain small, and there is a marked tendency for them to mature and dry up between 72 and 86 hours. The second reason for the better results is due to the routine practice which I introduced in 1911, and which has since been continued, of vaccinating a larger number of calves simulta- neously, ten in the morning and ten in the afternoon. The vesicles mature about the same time, and the observer has a wide margin from which to select the seed for the next batch of calves. In a very short time the eye becomes accustomed to the type of vesicle which gives the best results. The strain is rapidly passed through a large number of calves which are, as far as possible, never kept for long periods at the Institute (only on an average five to six days) ; the seed lymph except during intervals when vaccination is stopped is never kept for long periods. Calves kept for any length of time at the Institute soon begin to deteriorate ; there is practically no fresh grazing to be had ; they become infested with the calf louse, Haematopinus vituli, Enderlein, and latterly have developed a fungus disease of the skin simulating acariasis. Calves so infested with lice and the skin disease are unsuitable for purposes of vaccination. Latterly the technique of using the seed lymph has been further improved. If it is not to be used immediately it is without any further treatment placed in a sterile petri dish and stored in the cold room. When required it is pulped and mixed either with glycerine or with sterile saline solution, and then used for vaccinating the calves. Fivehundred and eighty-one calves were vaccinated in this way during the months of February and March 1914 and 5,413.4 grammes were collected from them, each calf yielding on an average 9.31 grammes. All the vesicles were well formed and typical; the lymph produced normal vesicles on children vaccinated at Saidapet. After a long series of passages through the calf the organism (?) of vaccinia becomes attenuated. This has long been recognised, and a recent observer has again drawn attention to the fact that the donkey is the best animal for exalting the virus ; unfortunately this animal is most difficult to procure locally. Failing this it has been found best to introduce the seed from different parts of the country and select the one which gives the best results. The rapid passage through a large number of healthy calves at definite periods of the year, especially avoiding the hot months of April, May and June, storing several good masses of vesicles in the semi-dry state for very short periods, pulping and mixing these either with glycerine or sterile saline solution is the routine technique now employed. It is interesting to note that about 6 per cent. of the calves are rejected as failures, i.e., either no vesicles have formed at the site of vaccination or only a few abortive ones. I believe that at least some of these animals have already had vaccinia and are either wholly or partially protected. The success rate in calves works out at 94 per cent. If a proportion of calves (6 per cent.), which are vaccinated with seed of a known potency and which give excellent results on several other animals vaccinated at the same time and over a comparatively enormous area of skin, fail to take, how much more is it likely that a proportion of children vaccinated over a comparatively small area of skin and often under most unfavourable circumstances will fail to take, or take badly. If the success rate in calves is 94 per cent. one can hardly expect it to be higher in children unless they are vaccinated with the greatest care and all precautions are taken to see that the vaccinated areas are not interfered with ; this is in many cases impossible in the case of village children. A perusal of the figures I have quoted lends no support to the view I have heard expressed that better cow-pox vaccine was obtained in the earlier years of the work of the vaccine section than during the later years. I have no hesitation in saying that the vesicles- produced as the result of triple lines are better than those from single lines.
REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY. 17 I have no opportunity of judging of the potency of the lymph as a protective agent against small-pox in man ; the potency of the lymph is judged by its behaviour on calves. I freely admit that the character of the vesicles and their abundance on the calves may have no connection with the potency of the lymph as a protective agent against small-pox, but here we enter the region of speculation. Lastly it is of some interest to note that the number of calves used for the production of cow- pox vaccine is now much less than before and yet the full amount of pulp is issued. The supply of calves appears to be unlimited and the contractors have recently been complaining that owing to the decrease in the number of calves used they do not find the business remu- nerative ; whether this is the case or not it is impossible to form an opinion. They are well deserving of every support for with very few exceptions the calves they bring are in excellent condition. The elaboration of these various data has thrown extra work on the Deputy Inspectors of Vaccination which they have cheerfully carried out, and I am satisfied with the way they and the vaccine staff generally have acquitted themselves in the discharge of their duties.

D. No. 325/V.D. OFFICE OF SANITARY COMMISSIONER, MADRAS, 17 th August 1915. From LIEUT.-COL. H. THOMSON, M.D., D.P.H., I.M.S., Acting Sanitary Commissioner for Madras, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, LOCAL AND MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. SIR, I have the honour to forward herewith the report of the Director, King Institute, Guindy, on the working of the Vaccine Section of the Institute, and that of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Madras, on the progress of vaccination in the Madras Presidency during the official year 1914-15. 2. Vaccine Section of the King Institute, Guindy.ANNEXURE I. ANNUAL REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE VACCINE SECTION OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, GUINDY. 1914-15. The total amount of vaccine supplied by the Institute during the year under report amounts to 1,983,417 cases. This is an increase over the previous year of 11,252 cases or 0.57 per cent. This figure of course constitutes a new record ; but as noted in last year any increase is likely to be by small increments only. 2. Table I shows the quantity of vaccine issued to various bodies for the quinquennium 1910-11 to 1914-15. TABLE I.

The falls under &quot; Government officers including Jails &quot; and &quot; Military Department &quot; are largely due to the fact that this year the amounts supplied to the Superintendent of Vaccination, Secunderabad, and to the Vaccinator, Bolarum, have been shown separately. In previous years these amounts were included among the cases supplied to &quot; Government officers &quot; and &quot; Military Department.&quot; Had this custom been adhered to, these headings would have shown a fall of only 14.1 per cent., and 1.6 per cent., instead of a fall of 56 per cent. and 7 per cent., respectively. The amount supplied to Municipalities remained practically stationary, a decrease of only 0.2 per cent. being recorded. Slight relative increases are shown under the headings, &quot;Agency Tracts&quot; and &quot;District Boards.&quot; These amount to 8 and 1.4 per cent., respectively. 3. There was no change in the manufacture of the lymph. As usual the bulk was made up with lanoline, but a small quantity of glycerinated lymph was supplied to Madras City and to Colombo. The latter is chiefly used as seed lymph. To the great majority of muffassal Districts and Municipalities the usual fortnightly supplies were made, but three supplies per month were continued to Chingleput and to parts of North and South Arcot. As the whole of Chingleput is so supplied B
6 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY. and shows a rise of 1.71 per cent. in the success rate, as against a fall of 0.86 in the Presidency generally, the scheme would appear to be successful. In North and South Arcot Districts, however, it is not so. At first the change seems to have had some benefit and the figures for April and May 1914 are strikingly improved over those for 1913. The improvement, however, has not been maintained and the figure for the whole year in these circles shows a decline over that for last year, notwithstanding the fact that the figures for the whole district, compulsory and non-compulsory areas together, are slightly better than those for 1913-14. 4. The system of monthly returns sent in through the Deputy Inspectors of Vaccination is now thoroughly established, and the change from fortnightly returns sent in an unchecked manner from the vaccinators has resulted in a great improvement in the regularity with which the returns are received. 5. The extra supplies sent out to Districts and Municipalities again rose and this year amounted to 15 per cent. of the total. This is an unduly high figure and by a closer estimate of probable requirements could be reduced and some of the consequent extra expenditure on tubes packing and postage and of the additional clerical work, avoided. Attention was called to this point in G.O. No. 917 L., dated 29th July 1910, and these extra returns had fallen to 10 per cent. in the year 1912-13, after having been as high as they are in this year. 6. TABLE II.

Table V shows the success rate obtained monthwar. There has been a slight fall of 0.86 per cent. over the whole year. The seasonal curve is quite different from what it usually has been, and we have the unusual spectacle of fair results being shown right through the hot weather and then the results falling off in October, when they usually are beginning to improve and remaining indifferent right through the cool weather. This is quite the most remarkable curve we have had to date, and it is difficult to account for. The drop becomes marked in October which is just about the time when the old stock of vaccine stored during the hot weather became exhausted, and freshly prepared vaccine was being issued. Stored vaccine accumulated again, and calf operations were stopped in the middle of November, and stored vaccine was used till the middle of February when fresh vaccine was again resorted to. These various changes were however without effect on the quality of the results obtained, which remained persistently indifferent. In 1913-14 the worst month was June and the best February. In 1914-15 the results of these months were, respectively, 13.8 per cent. better and 8.8 per cent. worse. 9. TABLE VI.

Coimbatore as usual is at the foot of the list and is again the only district which shows a success rate of under 80 per cent. Farther as the fall in its success rate is higher than that shown in any of the districts usually shown in comparison, its relative position is even worse than usual. Two districts show practically no change, less than 0.1 per cent. either way. Six districts show improvement and fifteen deterioration. Of the fifteen, nine show more than the overall fall, five less and one, the Niligris, has a fall practically identical with the general average. R10 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY. 12.

In an enclosure to the Report for 1913-14 Major Patton, I.M.S., found that better results were obtained on calves if the pulp were stored in the raw state and only ground and mixed as required. An attempt was made on a large scale to see if this held good and could be applied to children. It must be remembered that the conditions could not be made exactly parallel. With calves the seed lymph was ground, mixed and used. With children the lymph was ground, mixed and issued ; but the period of use would vary with the distance of destination, and the habits of the vaccinator. Every alternate batch of vaccine was stored and ground and mixed as required for issue, while the remaining half was ground, mixed, and stored till required for issue. Half the issue for each day was made up of each of these two kinds of paste. The results up to the end of March were distinctly against the new procedure. 82,828 cases done with paste made in the revised method were reported on and showed a success rate of 85.8 per cent.; whereas 88.71 per cent. out of 88,407 cases done with standard paste were reported as successful. Both these figures are disappointingly low, but returns of 170,002 cases done with stored standard lymph received contemporaneously, show a success rate of 86.18 per cent. For some reason the cold weather of 1914-15 seems to have been unfavourable to vaccinators' work. Considering the copious rains and that the calves had fair grazing right up till the end of March the lymph should have been better than usual, but, if so, the vaccinators do not appear to have been able to profit by it. The yield per calf was certainly larger than in the previous year and in a special series of calves, the results from which are given below, the average yield during the latter half of March and the whole of April was nearly as great as the maximum yield for the corresponding period of 1914. 17.

12 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY. Table XII gives the average yield per calf for the whole year and the large increase of 2.6 grammes or nearly 50 per cent. is seen. An attempt was also made to find out why the results got with any particular batch of seed lymph were so variable in the case of calves. Table XI shows that the yield may vary from 19 to 2 grammes, besides which there are total failures amounting to about 6 per cent. The time of ripening varies also within wide limits 72REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY. 13 TABLE XIV15 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1914-1915. From Dr. K. T.

The Government have, however, ordered that steps should be taken to improve the pay and prospects of the vaccination staffs throughout the rural areas in the hope of improving the quality of their work. There can be no doubt that the greatest defect in the present system of vaccination is the vaccinator himself. Many of the vaccinators are men of very little education who have no intelligent conception of their work and are consequently incapable of performing it satisfactorily. The large majority of them are men of the social level of peons and command little respect from the public. With a salary commencing at Rs. 7 per mensem and in a few cases even at Rs. 5, men of a better standard can hardly be expected. There is little to be gained by improving the pay and prospects of the present set of vaccinators. What is required for real improvement is a new set of vaccinators who are either Certificated Sanitary Inspectors with the necessary vaccination training or selected men of sufficient general education who are specially trained for the pur- pose at a Central Institution. Proposals for the improvement of the vaccination staff are being received from Presidents of District Boards and considered by Government. It would be a good thing indeed if these proposals are given effect to as they are approved instead of waiting until proposals for all the districts are received and sanctioned. (ii) The total vaccination work performed during the last two years by all agencies throughout the Presidency is shown in the following table :VACCINATION REPORT. 17 The percentage of total success both under primary and re-vaccinations during the year showed a slight decrease. The decrease was prominent under &quot; Cantonment Vaccinators&quot; and &quot; Dispensaries,&quot; over whom the Deputy Inspectors of Vaccination have little control. When compared with the previous year, the following districts show largest increases in infantile vaccination :18 VACCINATION REPORT.

ANNUAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY AND ON THE WORK OF THE VACCINE SECTION OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, GUINDY FOR THE YEAR 1915-16. MADRAS: PRINTED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT, GOVERNMENT PRESS. 1916.
OFFICE OF SANITARY COMMISSIONER, Madras, 2nd August 1916. D. No. 431/V. From MAJOR W. A. JUSTICE, M.B., C.M., D.P.H., I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Madras, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS, LOCAL AND MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. SIR, I have the honour to forward herewith the report of the Director, King Institute, Guindy, on the working of the Vaccine Section of the institute and that of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Madras, on the progress of vaccina- tion in the Madras Presidency during the official year 1915-16. 2. Vaccine Section of the King Institute, Guindy.4 with the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner in his remarks about vaccinators in paragraph 4 of his report. The question of the improvement of the pay and prospects of vaccinators and Deputy Inspectors of Vaccination has been pending for a long time past and the sooner it is settled the better it will be for the vaccination department of the Presidency. The recruitment of a proper staff of vaccinators on the present rates of pay is becoming difficult year after year and unless their position is improved on the lines laid down in the general scheme now under the consideration of Government, there will, I fear, be a retrogression in the quality of vaccination work turned out in the Presidency as a whole. I think it therefore very essential that the introduction of the new scheme should no longer be deferred. The total vaccination work performed during the year showed an increase both under &quot;Primary vaccination&quot; and &quot; Re-vaccination&quot;. The one notable feature is an increase of 92,578 cases in the total number of re-vaccinations per- formed during the year over those of the previous year, a sign certainly of appreciation by the people of the effect of re-vaccination during epidemics of small-pox. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, W. A. JUSTICE, Major, I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Madras.
5 ANNEXURE. ANNUAL REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE VACCINE SECTION OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, GUINDY, 1915-16.

The actual number is 2,113,697, an increase of 130,280 cases or 6.56 per cent. 2. Table I shows the quantity of vaccine issued to various bodies for the quinquennium 1911-12 to 1915-16. TABLE I.

Slight rises are also seen in the supplies made to Private Bodies, to Government officers including Jails and to the Vaccinator, Bolarum. The Civil Surgeon, Civil Hospital, Basrah, appears for the first time as in receipt of a regular supply. In previous years supplies of vaccine sent to Basrah at irregular intervals were included in supplies to Private Bodies. Marked falls are noted in the amounts supplied to the Military Department and to the Superintendent of Vaccination, Secunderabad, the percentage reductions amounting to 44 and 54, respectively. A slight fall of about 3.8 per cent is seen in the amount supplied to Agency Tracts. 3. There was no change in the manufacture of the vaccine. As usual the bulk was made up with lanoline; but glycerinated vaccine was supplied to Madras City and to Colombo. Madras City vaccinators prefer glycerinated vaccine, and as they can be readily supplied at frequent intervals, there is no objection on the score of the keeping qualities of the vaccine so made. The city usually takes a supply of 375 cases three times a week, but owing to small-pox having been epidemic during several months of the year, large extra supplies were also made. These extra supplies amounted to 37,175 cases which accounts for nearly 65 per cent of the increased supplies to Municipalities as compared with last year. 4. In the great majority of cases the fortnightly despatch was adhered to ; but the system of three despatches a month was extended to the Municipalities of Anantapur, Nellore, Cocanada, Coimbatore and Vizagapatam.

Table V shows the success rate reported monthwar. There has been a regrettable fall of over 3 per cent for the entire year. In the last annual report it was pointed out that the seasonal curve was a very abnormal one showing a consistently higher success rate during the hot weather than during the cold weather. The curve has again become normal but at the expense of the success rate. The year 1915 started badly with an abnormally low success rate which, on the advent of the hot weather, went lower still and resulted in the lowest recorded rates since the year 1904-1905. In one month indeed, August, the success rate for the whole Presidency fell below 80. A portion of the fall is of course due to the experiment in storing vaccine pulp in the raw condition and grinding and mixing it with lanoline as required for issue. The earlier stages of this experiment were described in last year's report. As this report was being compiled it was already clear from the results of operations made up to the 31st March 1915, that the new method was a failure. It was abandoned, but by that time there was a large accumulation of pulp which had been stored in the raw condition. It was ground up and mixed as rapidly as possible, and the paste so made was issued along with paste made in the usual fashion, equal quantities of each kind being sent out daily. 8. From April 1st, 1915, till 31st January 1916, on which date the last report dealing with the comparison was received, 356,418 operations had been carried out with paste, the pulp used in making which had been stored in the raw condition for some time. The last issues of such paste were made much earlier in the beginning of September. The success rate in these operations was only 80.54 per cent. The 367,156 cases, done with ordinary paste and issued in parallel with the above, gave a success rate of 84.77 per cent, 4.23 per cent higher. Even allowing for this, however, the success rate during the hot months of 1915 was abnormally low. The success rate obtained with the ordinary paste, in no way different from the paste issued in previous years, was lower over the whole period than the average for any month in the previous five years. What the main reason for the excep- tionally poor results got in the hot weather of 1915 was remains obscure. The paste was made in the months of FebruaryREPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 9 TABLE VI.

13 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1915-16. From Dr. K. T. MATTHEW, D.HY., D.P.H. (Cantab.), Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioner and Inspector of Vaccination, Madras, to the Sanitary Commissioner for Madras, No. 323, dated 12th July 1916. I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on Vaccination in the Madras Presidency for the year 1915-16. 2. Staff.14 VACCINATION REPORT and Madura districts. The general extension of the scheme to the other districts was abandoned during the last official year; but the Government in their Order No. 1248 L., dated 6th September 1915, reviewing the Annual Vaccination Report for 1914-15 stated that they hoped to issue general orders in the course of the year in regard to the improvement of the pay and prospects of vaccinators and Deputy Inspectors of Vaccination. The orders of Government have not yet been received and in the meantime the difficulties in the way of carrying on vaccination properly, portrayed in the previous report is becoming more and more acutely felt. The steady increase in the cost of living which has been going on in this country for the last few years together with the pretty sudden general rise in the price of food consequent on the great war has made it difficult for the humblest of menials to secure the bare necessaries of life on the old wages of Rs. 6 or Rs. 7 per mensem. And yet the dignified vaccinator who is not a menial but a subordinate officer has yet to begin public service on Rs. 5 to 7 a month with an unpaid probation extending to several months in some cases. Vaccination, simple as it looks, is a highly technical operation requiring con- siderable skill and intelligence to understand the details and it is an operation by law restricted to be done by fully qualified medical men in most civilized countries. Until we have a better set of vaccinators, it is hopeless to expect any real improvement in vaccination in this Presidency. I have during the last two years inspected vaccination practically in every part of the Presidency and the conclu- sion I have come to is that we are yet long way from the goal of perfection. The great defect in vaccination at present is not the large number that escape vaccination altogether, but the poor standard of successful vaccination. It should be noted that the protection from small-pox depends largely upon the quality of successful vaccination. To achieve any real progress, a staff of properly trained and adequately paid vaccinators is essential. A standard of general education should be prescribed together with a course of technical instruction at a Central Institute for a period of not less than three months and local bodies should be required to recruit vaccinators from among such duly qualified hands. The scheme for improving the pay and prospects of Deputy Inspectors of Vaccination already proposed and approved has to be brought into effect as soon as possible as a great deal depends upon an efficient and contented supervising staff. A conscientious Deputy Inspector of Vaccination has hard work to do.

(vii) A large number of deaths from small-pox was recorded during the year, the figures being 21,463 against 26,623 in 1914-15. The proportion of population protected in the districts and municipalities during the year is shown in the annexed two diagrams.

In the case of the municipal vaccinators it fell from As. 4-11 to As. 4-4, in spite of a slight increase in the cost of establishment. There appears to be room for further reduction since it should be cheaper to carry out these operations within the limits of a single town than it is when the vaccinators have to cover the whole area of a district. The cost was in excess of As. 5 in the districts of Chingleput, Koraput, GAGENTS FOR THE SALE OF MADRAS GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS. IN INDIA. A. C. BARRAUD & Co. (Late A. J. COMBRIDGE & Co.), Madras. R.

The total amount of vaccine supplied by the Institute during the year under report amounts to 2,024,220 cases. When compared with the supply of the previous year, there is a drop of 89,477 or 4.23 per cent. 2.

The most marked feature shown by the table is the great fall in the amount of vaccine supplied to District Boards and Municipalities. This fall amounts to 86,670 cases or 4.98 per cent and 24,150 cases or 10.23 per cent under District Boards and Municipalities, respectively. The fall in the supply to Municipalities was due to the Madras Corporation indenting for much less lymph than during last year, the epidemic of small-pox having been much milder during 1916-17 than during the previous year. Marked falls are also to be noted in the amounts supplied to the Superintendent of Vaccination, Secunderabad, and the Vaccinator, Bolarum, the percentage reductions amounting to about 11.59 and 30.97, respect- ively. The Civil Surgeon, Basrah, was supplied with 200 cases only and from April 1916 the supplies were stopped at his request. Marked rises, viz., 13.54 per cent and 19.54 per cent, are however seen in the supplies made to Government officers including Jails and Agency Tracts, respectively. Great increases are also seen under the headings of Private Bodies and Military Department. These amount to about 18.56 and 36.55 per cent, respectively. 3. There was no change in the manufacture of the vaccine. As usual, the bulk of the material issued was lanolinated vaccine, but glycerinated vaccine was supplied to Madras City and to Colombo as in previous years. 4. In the great majority of cases, the usual fortnightly despatch was adhered to ; but the system of three supplies per month was continued to Chingleput, and parts of G4 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 5. Extra indents from District Boards and Municipalities amounted to 16.64 per cent and 12.41 per cent, respectively, this year. In this respect there is a sudden fall in the case of Madras City which received an extra supply of 1,200 cases only for the whole year, when compared to 37,175 cases received in the previous year.

There has been a slight fall of 0.89 per cent over the whole year. With the exception of the month of July which shows a rise in the success curve, there is the usual low success rate in the summer and early autumn months. June is the worst month of the year while October is the best. The sudden drops in August, December and February are difficult to account for. The maximum success rate of 90.03 per cent falls short of the 93.74 per cent of the February previous by 3.71 per cent. TABLE VI.

9 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1916-17. From Dr. K. T. MATTHEW, D.HY., D.P.H. (Cantab.), Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioner and Inspector of Vaccination, Madras, to the Sanitary Commissioner for Madras, No. 209, dated 30th June 1917. I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on Vaccination in the Madras Presidency for the year 1916-17. 2. Staff.10 VACCINATION REPORT were called for for the reorganization of the vaccination staff of every district in G.O. No. 1686 L., dated 29th September 1914, on the basis of a scheme prepared by the President, District Board and the District Medical and Sanitary Officer of Salem and hence come to be known as the ' Salem scheme,' which is really a modification of the trial scheme or rather a compromise between the old system and the new ' trial scheme.' The essence of the ' Salem scheme' is, as in the ' trial scheme,' a better scale of pay for vaccinators and the taking off from them the duty of verifi- cation of results of vaccination which is entirely to be done by the Deputy Inspectors whose number in consequence has to be increased. These proposals have now been received from every district and forwarded to Government whose orders on the subject are awaited. The revised scale of pay proposed and approved for the Deputy Inspectors of Vaccination in G.Os. Nos. 1005 L., dated 13th September 1905 and 1814 L., dated 23rd October 1913, has also yet to be introduced. (ii) The total vaccination work performed during the last three years by all agencies throughout the Presidency is shown in the following table:VACCINATION REPORT 11 of primary and re-vaccinations is open to fallacy as a large increase in the number of re-vaccinations would greatly lower the combined rate, because the success rate in re-vaccination is invariably lower than in primary vaccination. It would therefore be strictly more correct to compare the success rate under primary (including secondary) from year to year. A perusal of the previous annual reports on vaccination in the Presidency shows that the success rate in primary vaccination which was 91.8 in 1913-14 came down to 90.8 in the next year, 87.7 in 1915-16 and 86.7 during the year under report. Special instructions in the form of circulars were issued during 1916-17 to ensure the prompt use of lymph and with the same end in view, as a trial, tri-monthly supply of lymph was made to five Municipalities12 VACCINATION REPORT When compared with the previous year there is a rise in the charges of Government and cantonment establishments and a fall in those of Local Funds and Municipalities. The average cost of each successful case rose from As. 3-9 in 1915-16 to As. 4-1 in the year under report. It varied from As. 2-6 in the Tinnevelly district to As. 11-2 in the Nilgiris. The Municipalities which showed a comparatively high cost per case are KodaikVACCINATION REPORT 13 diaries and one was reduced and two were fined for other irregularities and impro- per work. Of the 86 Deputy Inspectors of Vaccination borne on the provincial list 80 are qualified or certificated Sanitary Inspectors, the remaining are either exempted men or those specially selected for these posts before the present rules came into force. The service registers of all the Deputy Inspectors of Vaccination have been verified in the Sanitary Commissioner's Office. 6. My office staff have all done their work to my satisfaction and particularly the two range Head Clerks on whom I had to rely much for the proper conduct of office during my long and continuous tours. 7. In spite of timely intimation and repeated reminders the returns from the Chairman, Municipal Council, Chingleput, the Deputy Inspector of Vaccination, Dindigul range, the District Medical and Sanitary Officer, South Arcot, and the District Medical and Sanitary Officer, Chingleput, were received late, the last of them being only on 14th June 1917 against the due date of 1st May 1917. The preparation of this report was in consequence slightly delayed. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, K. T. MATTHEW, D.HY., D.P.H.

D. No. 849/V. OFFICE OF THE SANITARY COMMISSIONER, MADRAS, 19th August 1918. From MAJOR W. A. JUSTICE, M.B., C.M., D.P.H., I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner for the Government of Madras, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS, LOCAL AND MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. SIR, I have the honour to forward herewith the report of the Director, King Institute, Guindy, on the working of the Vaccine Section of the Institute and that of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Madras, on the progress of vaccination in the Madras Presidency during the official year 1917-18. 2. Vaccine Section of the King Institute, Guindy.2 The inspections of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners were, on the whole, satisfactory. Deputy Sanitary Commissioners should particularly bear in mind that the inspection of tracts much interior in the districts have been for a long time neglected and now that there is an additional Deputy Sanitary Commissioner on duty, they will see that no cause for complaint exists in this direction. The first programmes of inspection tours of these officers should include districts and tracts which have not been visited for a long time past. There are several such tracts in the East Coast and West Coast districts. (ii) Vaccination Staffs.ANNUAL REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE VACCINE SECTION OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, GUINDY, FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31ST MARCH 1918. The total number of cases supplied by the Institute during the year showed an increase of 66,779 or 3.29 per cent over that of the previous year. It was however still 22,698 or rather over 1 per cent short of the record number supplied in the year 1915-16. 2.

The quantities supplied to the Agency Tracts, District Boards, and the Vaccinator, Bolarum, remain substantially the same as in last year. That supplied to the Port Health Officer, Negapatam, is classed along with the supplies to Government Officers and the Civil Surgeon, Civil Hospital, Basrah, disappears altogether. All the others show percentage increases which is very large 126.9 per cent in the case of the Military Department, are moderate in the cases of the Superintendent of Vaccination, Secunderabad, and municipalities, 20.5 per cent and 17.2 per cent, respectively, and are small, 7.3 per cent and 3.8 per cent in the cases of Government officers including jails and private bodies. 3. There was no change in the manufacture of the vaccine. As usual the bulk of the material issued was lanolinated vaccine, but glycerinated vaccine was supplied to Madras City and to Colombo as in previous years. 4. In the great majority of cases the usual fortnightly dispatch was adhered to, but the system of three supplies a month was extended so as to include the whole of the Madura district. Districts receiving three supplies a month were then Chingleput, Madura and parts of the G4 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY with a fresh batch of paste is far too prevalent. It is to be hoped that under the new scheme this evil will be more effectually checked. 6. Extra indents from district boards and mufassal municipalities amounted to 18.95 per cent and 21.69 per cent, respectively. This shows a considerable increase and efforts ought to be made to arrive at a closer estimate of the quantity that will be required. In Madras City there were extra indents for only 600 cases out of a total of 72,975. TABLE II.

Table V shows the returns recorded at the King Institute from the whole of the Madras Presidency, excluding Madras City. It will be seen that there has been over the whole year a most regrettable drop of 3.78 per cent in the success rate as compared with last year. This is the biggest drop shown since 1910-11 and seems very difficult to explain. It is in the main due to extraordi- nary bad results in the first six months of the year when the average success rate was only 77.12 per cent or 9.69 per cent worse than that of the corresponding period of 1916. The results also come quite irregularly and do not show the usual temperature curve, the defect as compared with the previous year varying from 3.46 per cent in September to no less than 15.51 per cent in July. In the second six months of the year the average is 88.60 per cent or 0.32 per cent better than the corresponding period of 1916-17 and the figures follow the normal curve and even show the curious little autumnal drop in efficiency which has been frequently adverted to before.

The results over all being so much worse this year than last, it must be concluded that the period of storage, within the limits shown, has no detrimental effect on the vaccine. TABLE X.

The decrease of 0.01 gramme as compared with last year is in- appreciable. In five out of the eight last year's the figure has been five and a small fraction. It seems likely that with the present strains now available, this figure is the normal one. 16. Civil Assistant Surgeon S.

Fifty students attended and 49 of them obtained qualifying marks in the examination held at the end of the course. 18. Four medical graduates attended a course of instruction on the methods of preparation and preservation of animal vaccine and all passed the examination at the end of the course. 19.

11 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1917-18. From Dr. K. T. MATTHEW, D.HY., D.P.H. (Cantab.), Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioner and Inspector of Vaccination, Madras, to the Sanitary Commissioner for Madras, No. 217, dated 26th June 1918. I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on Vaccination in the Madras Presidency for the year 1917-18. 2. Staff.12 VACCINATION REPORT Rs. 10. These posts are also recommended to be made pensionable. It now remains for the District Boards in whom these appointments are vested to select suitable men for the posts and thus make vaccination in the Presidency a success. The reorganization was ordered to be given effect to from 1st April 1918. (ii) The total vaccination work performed during the past two years by all the agencies throughout the Presidency is shown in the following table:VACCINATION REPORT 13 perusal of the previous annual reports on vaccination shows that the success rate under primary vaccination was 91.8 per cent in 1913-14, 9.0 8 in 1914-15, 87.7 in 1915-16 and 86.7 in 1916-17. The success rate during 1917-18 as already observed was 83.4 so that there has been a continuous fall in the success rate from year to year. Steps taken by means of special circulars to improve the technique of operation and to use the lymph promptly and by the issue of tri-monthly supply of vaccine lymph to certain selected localities to ensure the more prompt use of lymph have not been of much avail. There is no doubt that many of the old vaccinators are difficult to be moved out of their old grooves. The fall is put down by several of the Deputy Inpectors to the indifference shown by unqualified vaccinators who expected to be ousted out of the department on the introduction of the new scheme. But even all these do not wholly explain the steady fall in the success rate. A trial with the use of freshly prepared lymph as opposed to stored lymph made towards the close of the year showed some improvement in the result and the supply of fresh lymph is now being continued. To ensure good vaccination three factors are necessary, viz. (1) good lymph, (2) good vaccinator, and (3) compulsory powers. The authorities at the King Institute are constantly on the alert to ensure a supply of good lymph. It is earnestly hoped that the district authorities will take full advantage of the G.O. No. 963 L., dated 4th July 1917, to purge the department of the old and useless vaccinators and to provide a proper set of men with suitable education and special training instead. It would indeed be a false sense of sympathy to exempt and continue in service any of the old vaccinators who cannot do full justice to their work And last but by no means the least I hope the Government will be pleased to introduce compulsory vaccination in all the districts except perhaps in the Agency tracts as soon as possible. In the absence of compulsory powers it is difficult to collect children in a suitable place for vaccination and verification of results and it remains to be seen whether the scheme sanctioned in G.O. No. 963 L., dated 4th July 1917, is even practicable without it.

D. No. 925/V OFFICE OF THE SANITARY COMMISSIONER, MADRAS, 21st August 1919. From DR. K. T. MATTHEW, D.HY., D.P.H. (CANTAB), Acting Sanitary Commissioner for the Government of Madras, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, LOCAL AND MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. SIR, I have the honour to forward herewith the reports of the Director, King Institute, Guindy, on the working of the Vaccine Section of the Institute and the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners, Northern, Central and Southern Ranges, on the progress of vaccination in the Madras Presidency during the official year 1918-19. 2. Vaccine Section of the King Institute, Guindy.2 The fall in the success rate was conspicuous in almost all the districts of the Presidency and was particularly so in Kurnool which recorded highest success rates successively for very many years past. The current year's rate in this district was 66.00 per cent against 96.84 per cent in 1917-18. The percentages in this district during the previous four years were 96.65, 96.82, 96.64 and 96.85, respectively. The general decline throughout the Presidency should be attributed primarily to the change in procedure of verification of cases as explained by the Director in paragraph 7 (2) of his report. 3. Vaccination Department3 was 73,450 and was marked under &quot;primary vaccination (including secondary vaccination),&quot; the decrease under this head being as many as 99,073 cases. The districts which showed largest decreases were South Arcot (4 without delay and that the department would be able to show better results in the future and retrieve the lost ground. (iv) Infantile vaccination.5 the Southern Range Deputy Sanitary Commissioner's report. It is time that the municipalities improved the personnel and pay of their vaccinators. (vii) The comparative success obtained by the use of different kinds of lymph in primary vaccination is shown in the subjoined table:ANNUAL REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE VACCINE SECTION OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, GUINDY, FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31ST MARCH 1919. The total quantity of vaccine supplied by the Institute during the year 1918-19 shows a marked increase. The actual number of cases issued is 2,128,590, an increase over the record figure of 1915-16 of 14,893 cases. 2. Table I shows the quantity of vaccine issued to various bodies for the quinquennium 1914-15 to 1918-19. TABLE I.

It will be seen that the increased issue is mainly due to supplies made to the Military Department. Slight rises are also found in the quantities issued to Government officers including Jails and District Boards. The requirements of municipalities and private bodies were somewhat less than last year. Those of the Agency Tracts, Superintendent of Vaccination, Secunderabad, and the Vaccinator, Bolarum, remained substantially the same. The issue to private bodies included about 17,000 cases sent to the Medical Officer, Berbera, in the Somaliland Protectorate. 3. No changes were made in the manufacture of the vaccine, the bulk of which was as usual made up with lanoline. Glycerinated lymph was, however, supplied to Madras City and to Colombo as in previous years. 4. The usual fortnightly despatch of vaccine was continued during the first quarter of the year. From the 1st of July, however, the date from which the new scheme brought in in compliance with G.O. No. 963 L., dated 4th July 1917, took effect, three issues per month were made to the whole Presidency. Exceptions to this rule were made in the case of the Agency vaccinators of Vizagapatam and G8 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY TABLE II.

(1) The monthly returns can be divided into two distinct groups according to the measure of success which has been attained. Between April and October the success rate remained consistently below the average. After this period, however, recovery took place and the results compare more favourably with those obtained in former years. Attention has already been drawn in previous reports to the presence of a seasonal variation which shows that the most unfavourable months for vaccination are May, June and July. After this, conditions as a rule gradually improve. In the present case, however, this improvement, if the slight temporary rise in August be excluded, was delayed until November. The year under review was a very dry one owing to the failure of the south-west monsoon and the climatic conditions prevalent in the hot season of the year were unduly prolonged into the cold season. It is probable that these exceptional conditions had an adverse influence upon vaccination throughout the Presidency, and were responsible for the extension of the &quot; negative phase &quot; into the autumn months. (2) The scheme of reorganization of vaccine operations inaugurated in compliance with G.O. No. 963 L., dated 4th July 1917,has brought about several important changes whose influence upon the vaccination returns is felt for the first time. Apart from the improved type of worker and the more frequent supply of vaccine (three times instead of twice a month as previously), the most important innovation is the introduction of the system by which results are verified by an independent authority. Formerly, both vaccination and verification were performed by the vaccinator, whose ability and skill were judged to a great extent by the results he obtained. The verification has now been placed under separate control and is now the province of the Deputy Inspector of Vaccination. Such a change in procedure would undoubtedly bring about a greater stringency in the examination and verification of cases, for it is only natural that the vaccinator in the past should have judged his own work from the most optimistic point of view. It would appear that this factor has had a profound modifying influence upon the returns submitted this year. TABLE VI.

A study of the curves produced by these two sets of figures reveals some interesting and important facts. It will be seen at once that the fall in the district success rate which has occurred this year is confined almost without exception to the 13 most successful districts of the previous year. The rates in the remaining 11 districts are substantially the same for both years. The drop in some districts is almost dramatic. Kurnool which has headed the list for so many years is now 23rd in the list and the districts of Trichinopoly and Vizagapatam fall to the 19th and 20th places. On the other hand, Madura, G12 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY Tables VII and VIII which give the percentage rates of success for the past five years show the effect of the lower success rate obtained during the current year upon the quinquennial average. (3) The potency of the vaccine lymph as issued from the Institute is a most vital factor upon which the whole success of the vaccination operations depends. It is therefore necessary to show that no deterioration has occurred in the quality of the lymph before any valid conclusion as to other causes of variation in the returns can be drawn. There has been no departure from the practice of former years in the prepa- ration of the vaccine. Lanolinated vaccine has been issued to all districts as heretofore. The manufacture of the vaccine has had to be continued throughout the whole year, with the exception of one month, owing to the increased output and traffic restrictions which caused difficulty in obtaining a sufficiency of calves for operation.

It is therefore extremely improbable that the quality of the vaccine has altered to any appreciable extent. The good results obtained in the Nilgiri district are extremely interesting from this point of view. A success rate of 93.8 has been obtained with vaccine which was identical with that supplied to the other districts. Further evidence of an experimental nature is also forthcoming. Two experiments were inaugurated with a view to proving or disproving the efficiency or otherwise of lymph issued from the Institute. The result of one of these has already been reported, for the information of Government, in letter R.C. No. 6796-5/V., dated 27th January 1919, to the Sanitary Commissioner, Madras. A short account of both experiments may, however, be given as bearing upon the point at issue. The first of these was designed to eliminate the vaccine as a cause of the irregularity observed in the returns submitted from different districts. Estimat- ing the quantity of paste that would be required for a full ten days' dispatch, all batches of vaccine making up this quantity were mixed together using the most meticulous precautions to ensure homogeneity. Two experimental batches were made up, No. 177, consisting of the yield of 44 calves or 5 ordinary batches, and No. 178, consisting of 47 calves or 5 ordinary batches. Samples from each were issued in succession to every vaccinator outside Madras City, except in a few cases where batch 178 was not sufficient to meet the demand. No. 177 was issued between August 14th and 23rd and No. 178 between August 24th and September 2nd. TABLE XI. Statement showing results obtained with two special batches of vaccine Nos. 177 and 178.

A small quantity from each batch of lanolinated vaccine has been sent to the Vaccination department of the Madras Corporation whose vaccinators have tested its efficacy on a varying number of cases as opportunity offered. Twenty-three batches of vaccine have been tested in this way during the year under report. The results which have been obtained have been compared with the returns sent in by the District Board and Municipal vaccinators. While the number of cases operated on by the Madras Corporation vaccinators is too small to justify the striking of a percentage rate of success for each individual batch, the total number of operations performed is sufficient to permit of a comparison being made between the Corporation and District results. The former shows 117 successes and 9 failures or 92.8 per cent of success, the latter 43,704 successes and 6,782 failures or a success rate of 86.5 per cent. The comparison is therefore 6.3 per cent in favour of the Corporation. In order to demonstrate that the conditions of experiment were substantially the same in both cases, certain details with regard to storage of vaccine and the time of use after manufacture are given in Table XIII.

After issue, however, the difference in the time which elapsed before the lymph was used is greater. The lymph sent to the Corporation was used within two days of its dispatch; that to the districts remained unused at times for as much as twelve days. Results obtained from outside sources are always of value as corroborative evidence in a question of this nature. During the year under review the Medical Officer, Berbera, was supplied with about 17,000 cases of lymph taken indiscriminately from the different batches prepared at the Institute. He reports upon its efficacy as follows :16 REPORT OF THE KING INSTITUTE, GUINDY 8. Table XIV gives details of the yield of pulp per calf throughout the year.

17 From Dr. K. T. MATTHEW, D.HY., D.P.H. (Cantab), Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioner and Inspector of Vaccination, Northern- and Central Ranges, Madras, to the Sanitary Commissioner for the Government of Madras, No. D. Dis. 196, dated 9th June 1919. I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on Vaccination for theNorthern and Central Ranges of the Presidency for the year 1918-19. 2. I was in charge of both the ranges throughout the year. 3. The following statements show the subordinate vaccination staffs employed in the two ranges during the past year as compared with the year previous :18 The number of vaccinators in the Northern Range was reduced from 300 to 175 and in the Central Range from 253 to 187. The pay of the lowest grade vacci- nator was raised from about Rs. 7 to Rs. 15 per mensem and the maximum from Rs. 25 to Rs. 40, each vaccinator being given a fixed travelling allowance of Rs 10 per mensem irrespective of the grade while he received little or none before. The minimum educational qualification prescribed for the vaccinator is a Secondary School Leaving Certificate with a special vaccination training under a competent authority approved by the Sanitary Commissioner, the maximum being a complete Sanitary Inspector's certificate with vaccination training which is the qualification required for a first class vaccinator. The great reduction in the number of vaccinators is due to the fact that the vaccinator is relieved entirely of the duty of verifying the results of cases vaccinated by him, a duty which is now solely delegated, to the Deputy Inspector of Vaccination. (2) Changes in the system of vaccination work.19 Doubts and difficulties with regard to the local training of second-class and proba- tionary vaccinators cropped up in various districts and for the removal of these a circular with a syllabus was drawn up in this office and issued by the Sanitary Commissioner to all District Medical and Sanitary Officers with the concurrence of the Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras on 23rd November 1918. So between one thing and another, the new scheme cannot be said to be in working order as yet. But there is not the slightest doubt that the scheme has in it the nucleus of a great change for the better. It is yet in its infant stage and requires to be carefully nurtured. The following are some of the difficulties experienced in the working of it:20 South Arcot and Salem the decrease in the number of operations as compared with the corresponding period of the previous year was 43,934. Orders were issued to make up this fall by extra work during the last quarter of the , year and as a result the fall is not so great as it would otherwise have been during the year under report and this in spite of a number of vacancies in the vaccinating staff. The reports of the Deputy Inspectors disclose that there were vacancies in the vaccinating staff without substitutes for shorter or longer periods in the majority of the ranges. In the Northern Range, as compared with the previous year, the districts of Kistna (+ 10,622), Koraput (+ 1,787), and Nellore (+ 368) showed an increase in the number of operations and all the other districts showed a decrease, Gunt21 Northern Range. 10. Infantile vaccination.22 percentage of success obtained during the year. The increase in the cost of Local Fund and Government establishments is marked. This in part is due to the enhanced rate of pay sanctioned in G.O. No. 963 L., dated 4th July 1917, which was given effect to during the year under report. This has also to some extent contributed to the rise in the general average cost. 12. It is noticed that in many municipalities the salary paid to the vaccinators is extremely low in spite of the scale fixed in G.O. No. 1592 M., dated 22nd August 1914, viz., Rs. 1523 15. The following tables exhibit the comparative success obtained by the use of different kinds of lymph in primary vaccination including secondary :24 19. There were three deaths among the Deputy Inspectors of Vaccination in the Central Range. One Deputy Inspector in the Northern Range was reduced from the second to the third grade for falsification of diaries. 20. I have to add the following remarks regarding my office establishments :. The ministerial staff is quite inadequate. The jurisdiction of each Deputy Sanitary Commissioner extends over a third of the Presidency and in that vast area he has to correspond with various classes of officers. The duties pertaining to the office staff are varied and multifarious and have to be attended to by only two clerks, one of whom has to accompany the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner on his tours. A third clerk is absolutely and urgently necessary if the office work is to be carried out well in all its details. Further the staff is distinctly underpaid. The pay of the Head Clerks has been fixed at Rs. 45. The Head Clerk of Central Range is a certificated Sanitary Inspector specially selected from among the Sanitary Commissioner's office staff by Major Quirke, I.M.S., and the Head Clerk of Northern Range is a fully qualified Sanitary Inspector with vaccination training besides being an F.A. of the Madras University. The latter is my own selection from the Health Department of the Corporation of Madras and he is still continuing on the salary of Rs. 45 with which he was started, although he has put in a satisfactory service of over five years. There appears to be no use in his looking up to the Sanitary Commissioner's office in accordance with G.O. No. 1653 L., dated 5th November 1912, for any increase of salary. Both are steady men of character and ability and over 35 years of age. It is needless to say that their technical knowledge is very useful in such an office as this. The post of the Head Clerk is very onerous and responsible besides being one of trust. The pay was fixed at Rs. 45 when the pay of the Deputy Inspectors of Vaccination ranged from Rs. 40 to Rs. 70. Now that the pay of the Deputy Inspectors of Vaccination has been increased to Rs. 5025 From Dr. S. JESUDOSS, B.A., M.B., C.M., D.P.H. (Cantab.), F.R.C.S.E., Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Southern Range, Coimbatore, to the Sanitary Commissioner for the Government of Madras, No. D. 521, dated 9th July 1919. I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on Vaccination in my range with the appendix statements for the year 1918-19. 2. Staff.26 (ii) The compartmental system.27 The decrease in all these cases is attributed to the prevalence of influenza during the year under report. Malabar is the only district which shows increase in every direction and this was due to a very large number of re-vaccinations and adult vaccinations performed during the last quarter consequent on the outbreak of smallpox epidemic in Ponnani taluk.

No. 4999-1 L., dated 7th October 1919, the report is for the three years ending 1919-20. 3. Dr. Matthew continued to hold charge of the Central and Northern Ranges from September 1914 when Captain (now Major) Quirke, I.M.S., proceeded on Military duty up to the end of November 1919 but as this arrangement could not be continued any longer, Dr. Adiseshan, the Health Officer, Madura Municipality, was appointed as a Deputy'Sanitary Commissioner and posted to the Northern Range in December 1919 thus bringing up the full compliment of three Deputy Sanitary Commissioners sanctioned for the Presidency. This number having been found inadequate the question of employing additional Deputy Sanitary Commissioners was considered during the year and provision has been made for employing three more officers. Dr. Jesudoss was in charge of the Southern Range throughout the year 1919-20. 4. The inspection work of the three Deputy Sanitary Commissioners was as follows :2 district and Cumbum valley in the Madura district for malaria; Kollegal for the inspection of proposals submitted by the District Board for the relief of conges- tion and Kakkakulam and Anaikulam in the Tanjore district for inspection of waters stocked with larvicidal fish. Dr. Adisesha Ayyar during the three months he held charge of Northern Range inspected sanitation and vaccination in three Municipalities and vaccination in 95 villages in two districts and verified 2,831 cases. He attended the Public Health Exhibition at Madras and the Maternity and Infant &quot;Welfare Exhibition at Delhi in February 1920. 5. The following table contrasts the staff employed during the last three years :3 ( 4 10. The cost of the various Vaccination staffs and the average cost of each successful case are exhibited in the sub-joined statement:5 15. During the year under report, two Deputy Inspectors of Vaccination died, five were punished, two with dismissal and three with reduction for submis- sion of false diaries and serious irregularities in their work, one was fined and one warned for carelessness and unsatisfactory work. 16. The Service Registers of all the Deputy Inspectors of Vaccination have been verified and brought up to date. 17. The Vaccination Code is being revised so as to bring into line with the recent rulings on the subject. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, G. G.

D. No. 879/V. OFFICE OF THE SANITARY COMMISSIONER, MADRAS, 6th September 1921. From MAJOR A. J. H. RUSSELL, M.A., M.D., D.P.H., I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner for Madras. To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT (PUBLIC HEALTH) DEPARTMENT, MADRAS. SIR, I have the honour to forward the Report on Vaccination in the Madras Presidency during the official year 1920-21. 2. In G.O. No. 460, L. & M. (Medical), dated 31st August 1920, Dr. Matthew, the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Central range, was placed on special duty to report on the sanitary requirements of pilgrim centres not reported upon by the Pilgrim Committee and proceeded on privilege leave preparatory to his entering upon his special duty. In the absence of another officer to take his place, the Central range was placed in charge of Dr. Jesudoss, Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioner, Southern range, without prejudice to his own duties with headquarters at Madras. He discharged the combined duties of the two ranges up to the 23rd December 1920 when Captain Ubhaya, on appointment as Deputy Sanitary Com- missioner, relieved him of the Southern range. 3. The inspection work of the three Deputy Sanitary Commissioners was as follows:2 of the cholera parties in the neighbourhood of Pulicat and Armagaon lighthouses was carried out by him and the criminal settlement of Stuartpuram in Gunt3 The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Northern range, mentions two instances of apathy of village officers and the absence of compulsory vaccination which are worth recording:4 Compared with the previous year, the total number of vaccinations during 1920-21 shows a decrease of 45,347 due entirely to a fall in the number of re-vaccinations. The whole question of re-vaccination is one which deserves more attention than it has received in the past. The figures for separate ranges are given in the following statement:5 Both primary vaccination and re-vaccination show a regrettable decline in the percentage of success during the year under report. Compared with the previous year the decrease under primary vaccination amounts to 16.7 per cent and under re-vaccination to 11.8 per cent. It is certain that this is partly due to deteriora- tion in the quality of the vaccine lymph manufactured at the King Institute and partly to the temporary substitution of glycerine vaccine. As a result of Major Cunningham's and Dr. Kesava Pai's visit to Belgaum and the Punjab the whole question was thoroughly investigated and a scheme for improved methods of lymph manufacture was submitted to Government in this office letter D. No. 98 K.I., dated 12th April 1921. It is hoped that the introduction of the method of manufacture and storage therein recommended will ensure better vaccination results, but further improvements are under trial and experiment and the problem, as it presents itself in this Presidency, is by no means solved. The further experi- ments with the Madras and Bangalore lymph referred to in G.O. Mis. No. 438- P.H., dated 3rd May 1921, were cancelled in accordance with instructions given in G.O. No. 706-P.H., dated 22nd June 1921. 8. Infantile Vaccination.6 The average cost of each successful case rose from As. 7-4 in 1919-20 to As. 10-8 in the year under report. It varied from As. 6-1 in the North Arcot district to as high as Rs. 1-2-9 in the Nilgiri district ; whilst in municipalities, excluding Madras, the variations were from Rs. 1-6-10 in Erode to As. 2-8 in Calicut. The average cost in the Madras Corporation was Rs. 2-8-0 per case. The increased cost is attributable to the low percentage of success obtained during the year and to the grant of temporary increases of pay to Deputy Inspectors of Vaccination, vaccinators and peons. 10. 153,594 operations were performed in municipalities during the year against 159,764 in the preceding year, the largest decrease occurring in Madras (7 15.
