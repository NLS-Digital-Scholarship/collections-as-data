This is regrettable as some years ago it was felt that inoculation was growing in favour with cultivators and that they were showing a willingness to submit their animals to it. The standing difficulty of course is that in view of the vast expendi- ture which would be involved, compensation for animals affected or which die as a result of inoculation is out of the question. The suggestion of the Veterinary Adviser to establish a " Contagious Diseases Fund " will, however, be investigated. If such a scheme is feasible Government will be in a stronger position to insist on com- pulsory inoculation. 5. Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries.REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA (INCLUDING THE INSEIN VETERINARY SCHOOL) For the Year ended the 3lst March 1923. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. 1. Mr. T. Rennie was in charge of the Department till March 13th when he went on leave after handing over to Mr. C. J. N. Cameron. During the year Mr. Rennie travelled 216 miles by road, 130 by river and 4,344 by train, visiting 14 districts and inspecting the work of 10 Veterinary Inspectors and 27 Veterinary Assistants. He attended a Conference of Heads of Departments at Maymyo and a Conference at Rangoon. He also attended a Farmers' Meeting at Mahlaing, Meiktila District. He inspected the Taunggyi Veterinary School and the Veterinary Dispensaries at Prome and Pegu. Mr. C. J. N. Cameron travelled 1,403 miles by rail, 5 miles by road and 1,507 miles by river. He visited 7 districts and inspected the work of 2 Deputy Superintendents, 6 Veterinary Inspectors and 12 Veterinary Assistants. He also inspected the Veterinary Dispen- saries at Prome, Pakôkku, Myingyan and Pegu. He attended the second Veterinary Conference held at Calcutta under the orders of the Government of India and was a Member of the Committee appointed to examine into the needs of the Veterinary School, Insein. Captain O'Neill's headquarters were transferred at the beginning of the year to Mandalay. He travelled 600 miles by road, 1,080 miles by river and 1,363 miles by rail. He attended the outbreak of rinderpest in the Upper Chindwin District. He inspected the work of 5 Veterinary Inspectors and 34 Veterinary Assistants, visiting 7 districts and was on tour for 88 days. Captain Idle's services were transferred to the Agricultural Department for Stock Breeding early in the year. 2. Mr. J. C. Batlivala on return from leave resumed charge of his duties at the Veterinary School, Insein. Sardar Bahadur Bhagwan Singh, Deputy Superintendent, was in charge of the Military Police throughout the year. He attended to an outbreak of surra amongst the Putao mules at the beginning of the rains and in August he took charge of anti-rinderpest inoculation work in Amherst vice Maung Kyaing who had met with an accident.
2 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT (INCLUDING THE INSEIN Maung Pe Than, Deputy Superintendent, was in charge of Meiktila, Kyauksè, Toungoo and Myingyan districts with headquarters at Meiktila. He was on leave for two months on average pay and during that time Maung Kyaing, Deputy Superintendent, on probation, held charge. Maung Tun Aung, Deputy Superintendent, was in charge of Pak&kku, Magwe, Minbu and Thayetmyo districts with headquarters at Magwe and carried out his duties satisfactorily. Maung Nyan Kyaw, Deputy Superintendent, was placed in charge of the Irrawaddy Division with headquarters at Bassein. His work during the year was also satisfactory. Maung Kyaing, Deputy Superintendent on probation, after relin- quishing charge at Meiktila assumed charge of Amherst, Thatôn, Mergui, Tavoy and Salween districts with headquarters at Moulmein. He unfortunately broke his arm in August which necessitated his going on leave for two months. This Deputy Superintendent had a very strenuous and anxious time dealing with rinderpest in his charge.

Towards the end of the year building operations for the erection of a pharmacy, dressing shed and operating room and a laboratory were commenced. The provision of an adequate supply of water was also under consideration. Table V. 4. Hospital.4 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT (INCLUDING THE INSEIN Kawkareik township ; it reached its greatest virulence between June and August after which it subsided and by October had practically died out. There was a further recrudescence towards the close of the year in the same townships where disease is still prevailing. Inocula- tion parties have been sent down from time to time and the results of their labours are detailed under preventive inoculation. Several other outbreaks of varying virulence were also reported from other districts, viz., Toungoo, Mergui, Salween and Thatôn but except in the last named district the losses were not serious. Anthrax.VETERINARY SCHOOL), BURMA, FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31st MARCH 1983. 5 died are buffaloes, and agricultural operations are said to have suffered seriously owing to their loss. The Deputy Commissioner remarks that "all that could be done to prevent the spread of the disease was undertaken and inoculation was carried on extensively " and " Carcases of dead animals are buried as far as possible in accordance with the rules. But during any abnormal epidemic similar to that which occurred in Paungbyin carcases were found floating in the streams but no action could be taken as the owners could not be traced." The Deputy Commissioner further remarks that " the work of the veterinary staff was not as good as one could wish for. Inspector Maung Pe did a lot of inoculation but owing to his tactlessness and thoughtlessness in dealing with the villagers he has not improved the popularity of the Veterinary Department. He also quarrelled with his Veterinary Assistants and finally when he was brought to book he tried to comit suicide by jumping overboard from a Government steamer." This is the second time Maung Pe has attempted suicide, he was tried, convicted and bound over and was given medical leave for six months. At the end of that time he will be examined by a medical board and if declared unfit the case will be forwarded for the orders of Government. The principal offender amongst the Veterinary Assistants has been severely reprimanded and transferred elsewhere.

The Superintendent and Political Officer observes in his report that, " Attempts are on foot to set an example in the matter of caring for and rearing stock according to modern methods . . . . It has repeatedly been claimed that the Southern Shan States are a magnificent field for agriculture but that branch of Shan States produce has not yet been fully developed. Stock breeding is in my view an important stage towards establishing the prosperity of these States where the chief means of transport are still ox-carts, pack oxen and mules and ponies." A piggery at Thamakhan and a poultry farm at Heho are said to be working satisfactorily while application for the lease of a large area near Kalaw is said to have been made for the establishment of a Dairy Farm. Veterinary School, Taunggyi.8 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT (INCLUDING THE INSEIN during the year, preventive inoculation was carried out in 107 villages in the following districts, viz:VETERINARY SCHOOL), BURMA, FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1923. 9 (4) Other Diseases. 12. The mortality from various causes other than Rinderpest, Anthrax and Foot-and-mouth diseases in Lower Burma was 64,147 and in Upper Burma 15,311. (5) Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries. Table V. 13. The three Veterinary Dispensaries situated in Prome, Myingyan and Pakôkku remained open during the year. As regards the Myingyan Dispensary the Deputy Commissioner remarks, " the Veterinary Dispensary at Myingyan has been a sufficient success to make me desire the extension of the experiment to other township headquarters notably Kyaukpadaung." Myingyan is a large pony breeding centre and that the local pony breeder has been quick to take advantage of the dispensary is shown by the number of ponies brought for treatment. The dispensary at Prome shows some improvement on last year's figures, though not much, and the Deputy Commissioner remarks " it has been a long felt necessity and as its existence is more widely known it will be more and more appreciated." Pakôkku Dispensary also shows some improvement. My own personal opinion is these dispensaries will be a success when proper buildings, stable accommodation, equipment and staff are provided. At present these dispensaries are located in hired Burmese houses and as every one knows there is no stable accommodation and very little compound. Owners of sick animals have not the time to attend to their nursing effectively, and also, I presume, find it difficult to bring the animal daily for treatment in some cases. This has been our experience at Insein and I have no doubt it is the same in the district. When proper facilities have been provided as has been suggested out of the profits of the Rice Control I have very little doubt these dispensaries will show a great improvement. It must not be forgotten, however, that the business of this department, as it is of all State Veterinary Departments, is the suppression and prevention of contagious disease and not the treatment of common every-day ailments. These dispensaries are however useful in that they demon- strate practically The benefit of western veterinary science. Seeing is believing and it is very much easier to convice the cultivator by practical work than by all the lectures and pamphlets ever published, and for this reason alone I should be very glad to see these dispen- saries increased in number and properly equipped. The fourth dispensary was opened during the year at Pegu as originally arranged and judging by the results of about four and a half months I think the experiment will be a success.

What has struck me very forcibly in preparing this report has been the extraordinary discrepancy between the deaths from non- contagious and from contagious disease. I would draw attention for instance to the following figures :14 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT (INCLUDING THE INSEIN 20. Examination of Thugyis and others.VETERINARY SCHOOL).

The simplest and least expensive way of dealing with cattle disease is to insist on the observance of the cattle disease rules and if the headman does not know the symptoms of contagious disease it will not take him long to find them out. 2t.

Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Burma (Ministry of Agriculture), No. 2580., dated the 30th August 1924. READFrom J. F. SHEEHY, Esq., I.C.S., Secretary to the Development Commissioner, Burma, to the Secretary to the Government of Burma, Department of Agri- culture, Excise and Forests,( 2 ) 4. It is unnecessary to emphasise here the great drain that these annual losses of cattle from disease must be on the agricultural resources of the country. This is fully recognised, and the staff is doing what lies in its power to lessen it. The reorganization of the Depart- ment which is now under consideration will no doubt lead to more comprehensive and intensive effort. In his report Mr. Blake points to the necessity of an increase in the number of local dispensaries. It is hoped that it will be found possible to extend these institutions, which it would seem are finding favour with the people. 5. The Special Officer in meeting the needs of the country has a heavy task in front of him, but Mr. Blake has approached it in a way that makes for success and will bring relief to the present distressful conditions.
REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA (INCLUDING THE INSEIN VETERINARY SCHOOL) For the Year ended the 31st March 1924. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. 1. Mr. C. J. N. Cameron was in charge of the Department as Officiating Veterinary Adviser till the 28th of August, on which date he proceeded on leave for two years and four months, handing over charge to Mr. A. McKerral, I.A.S., Director of Agriculture, Burma. Mr. Blake assumed charge as Special Officer in the Civil Veterinary Department, Burma, from the 1st September. Mr. Cameron inspected the office of the Third Superintendent, Mandalay, in April and the Veterinary School at Taunggyi in May. He was on tour for 31 days, visiting four districts and inspecting the work of the Deputy Superintendent at Moulmein, three Veterinary Inspectors and ten Veterinary Assistants. He travelled 1,940 miles by rail, 204 by boat and 214 by road. Mr. A. Blake, soon after assuming charge as Special Officer, visited the Ngathainggyaung-Kyônpyaw Hooded area accompanied by the Deputy Superintendent, Bassein. A separate report on the subject has already been submitted to the Local Government. He travelled 3,867 miles by rail, 2,590 by steamer and 223 by road, visiting 16 districts and inspecting the office and work of the Third Superintendent at Mandalay, the Deputy Superintendent at Bassein, 13 Veterinary Inspectors and 64 Veterinary Assistants. During the year the Veterinary Dispensaries at Pegu, Pakôkku, and Prome, the Agricultural Farms at Mahlaing and Mandalay, and the Military Police Ponies Reserve Battalion at Pyawbwe were also inspected by him. He also attended the Agricultural and Cattle Shows at Meiktila, Mandalay and Allanmyo, and a meeting of the Public Health Board held at Maymyo. In all he was out on tour for 132 days. The services of Captain A. O'Neill, the Third Superintendent, posted at Mandalay, were dispensed with, he having failed to pass the prescribed test in Burmese, and he relinquished charge of his duties to
2 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPT., BURMA, Mating Pe Than, Deputy Superintendent, Meiktila, on the 2nd July. He visited three districts, and was out on tour for 17 days, travelling. 1,538 miles by rail and 20 by road. Captain S. R. Rippon reported his arrival on the 18th February 1924. He was posted to duty, with headquarters at Rangoon, and is at present under training in the office. Maung Pe Than held charge as Deputy Superintendent at Meiktila till the 2nd July, on which date he was appointed to officiate as Superintendent and was posted to Mandalay. As Officiating Superin- tendent he visited 24 districts, inspected the work of 3 Veterinary Inspectors and 13 Veterinary Assistants. He travelled 6,679 miles by rail, 1,967 by steamer and 600 by road. 2. Mr. J. C. Batlivala, Deputy Superintendent, was in charge of the School at Insein throughout the year, having been granted a second year's extension of service. The success of the school is largely due to his untiring energies, whilst his thoroughness inspires confidence in the people who bring their animals to the hospital for treatment. Sardar Bahadur Bhagwan Singh, Deputy Superintendent, who was given another extension of service for one year, held charge of the Military Police Ponies throughout the year. He attended an outbreak of Glanders in the Myitkyina Battalion Ponies, and also in ponies belonging to private owners at Yegyi. Maung Tun Aung, Deputy Superintendent, continued in charge of the Pakôkku, Minbu, Magwe and Thayetmyo Districts, with head- quarters at Magwe. I regret to say that owing to ill-health he had to go on three months' leave, but was fortunately able to resume his duties on the expiry of his leave. Maung Nyan Kyaw, Deputy Superintendent, in charge of the Irrawaddy Division, with headquarters at Bassein, was obliged to go on eight months' leave with threatened tuberculosis. Maung Nyan Kyaw is a useful officer and worked very hard in connection with the relief work amongst cattle and other animals in the flooded area at Ngathainggyaung. It was immediately on completion of this work that his health gave way. Maung Kyaing, Deputy Superintendent, Moulmein, is in charge of the Tenasserim Division. He is still on probation, but carried out the arduous duties in connection with the suppression of disease in the Amherst District with promptness and zeal. I.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1924. 3 more than half. One of the pupils who failed was found copying, and his paper in that subject4 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPT., BURMA, to be adopted in obtaining and forwarding material, e.g., blood, faeces, etc., to the laboratory for examination. These were sent down for training, the first batch, consisting of six officers and twelve Burmans, attended from 13th to 20th August ; the second, eight officers and five subordinates, between 5th and 16th November ; and the third of four officers and ten Burmans, between 23rd and 30th November. Mr. Cameron and Mr. Batlivala undertook the instruction of the English-speaking officers and Maung San Hla, one of the lecturers at the school, took all the three classes of the Burmese subordinates. In July the school was honoured by a visit from His Excellency the Governor, who, after a thorough inspection, expressed the opinion that the existing facilities were totally inadequate and hoped that the proposals for rebuilding the school, as recommended by the Special Committee, would receive the sympathetic consideration of the Honour- able Minister and the Finance Department. The Honourable Minister for Agriculture. Excise and Forests also visited the school during the year, as also did the Development Commissioner. During the year, the Headmaster of the American Baptist Mission Union High School, Rangoon, asked permission to allow 30 of his High School boys to visit the Hospital and to learn some facts regarding cattle diseases. On the 1st December these boys were shown round the hospital, and some of the salient points regarding contagious diseases amongst the agricultural stock, and how to deal with them, were lectured upon by Mr. Batlivala. The report of the Committee appointed last year to inquire into the training of the Veterinary Assistants, and the needs of the school as regards buildings, etc., was submitted to Government during the year. Two buildings, viz., the Pharmacy with dressing shed, and Bacterio- logical Laboratory are now under construction ; and a tube-well, which is reported as successful, has been sunk in the school compound. The question of the provision of the other buildings as recommended by the Committee is still under consideration. Three outbreaks of Rinderpest occurred in the vicinity of Insein during the year and advantage was taken to instruct the students of C and B classes in anti-rinderpest serum inoculation, as follows :FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1924. 5 Amongst the important specific diseases met with were Cattle Plague, Foot-and-Mouth disease, Glanders, Anthrax, Surra, Distemper, Piroplas- mosis and Mange, whilst the remaining cases treated may be classified as follows :6 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPT., BURMA, Kyaikmaraw townships, the losses being 250, 169 and 136 respectively. The Deputy Commissioner remarks that " the reason for the severity of the outbreak is due to the people opposing inoculation, segregation of cattle, and systematic disposal of carcasses." He further remarks that " the practice of allowing cattle to stray in jungles caused unnecessary delay in the detection of disease by owners and a consequent delay in report." In addition to the district staff comprising a Deputy Superintendent, one Veterinary Inspector and seven Assistants, five assistants and three senior students were sent to assist in coping with the outbreaks and to help in inoculation operations. The Deputy Superintendent, Amherst, reports, " Restriction of routes by which cattle are imported from Siam into Burma was carried out under Rule 13 of Burma Revenue Department Notification No. 83 of 1914 and Thingunnymaing, Kweshan and Tadangu villages were selected as quarantine stations and two Veterinary Assistants were deputed as inspecting officers. The Veterinary Assistant at Kawkareik was also ordered to co-operate with them in inspection occasionally. The latter, on discovering Rinderpest amongst Siamese cattle at Tadangu, took the necessary steps for segregation. " Restriction of movement of cattle on the main lines of communi- cation near places where the disease prevailed was extensively carried out when necessary, with beneficial results, especially in Amherst, Mudôn, Kyaikmaraw and Kawkareik townships." Sporadic outbreaks occurred in parts of Pegu District between August and November and Thatôn District during the early part of the year. Anthrax.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1924. 7 Special Duty.8 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPT., BURMA, the infected area, while the Third Superintendent also visited the district frequently directing operations. I also visited the district during the year. The only other district in Upper Burma in which the mortality recorded was over a thousand was Yamethin. The number of deaths reported during the year was 1,024, of these 419 occurred in the Yamethin and 405 in the Pyawbwè townships. One Veterinary Inspector and two Assistants were posted in the Pyinmana Subdivision on special duty. The Deputy Commissioner remarks, " The serious outbreaks of the disease during the year are said to be due to bad rains. " Minor outbreaks also occurred in the Taungdwingyi, Myothit and Natmauk townships of the Magwe District.

There were eight students under training ; only one from Mong Nai is stipendiary; the others are paid by their respective States. 9. Northern Shan States.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1924. 11 (2) Other Contagious Diseases. 10. The diseases noted below were reported and confirmed by microscopical examination in the Laboratory : Piroplasmosis12 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPT., BURMA, number of cattle reported to have died after inoculation was 178, i.e. 49 per cent. In the Amherst District the Deputy Commissioner remarks that " inoculation was carried out as extensively as possible and 2,998 heads of cattle were injected with good results. In the Kawkareik, Mudôn and Kyaikmaraw townships and in some parts of the Kya-in township people began to realize the advantages of inoculation and the operation is becoming more popular." Conditions prevailing in the Upper Chindwin District, where the losses of cattle from Rinderpest have been so heavy, have been noted elsewhere in this report, and to these may be added the difficulty of transport of serum and of maintaining a sufficiency on the field during the outbreak, hence it is not surprising to find that the number of cattle inoculated in that district amounts to 656 only. In the Thanatpin township of the Pegu District the Subdivisional Officer reports that " inoculation did not seem to be popular amongst cattle owners " whereas in the Pegu township inoculation is reported to have " successfully checked an outbreak which threatened to be severe in cattle belonging to the rubber plantation near Mahazedi Pagoda." In the Daik-u township of the same district during an outbreak at Yenawthaung, the villagers, who are mostly Karens, are reported to have given every assistance to the Veterinary Assistants and " very willingly " brought forward their cattle for inoculation and as a result the " outbreak was stamped out immediately." In the Bhamo District the Deputy Commissioner remarks with respect to inoculation that " there is still some hesitation when inocula- tion is proposed. This reluctance to inoculation will disappear in time." Excluding the School staff and pupils, two Deputy Superintendents, fourteen Veterinary Inspectors and 75 Veterinary Assistants were employed during the year on serum inoculation duty. (4) Other Diseases. 12. Reported deaths from other causes total 77,863 as shown in the following table :FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1924. 13 North-West Border Division ... 6,776 Mandalay Division ... ... 7,297 North-East Frontier Division ... 515 Total 14,588 (Upper Burma) (5) Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries. Table V. 13. Excluding the Hospital at Insein there, were four dispensaries working during the year, viz., one each at Myingyan, Pakôkku and Prome opened in 1921, and one at Pegu opened in 1922. Myingyan dispensary heads the list of animals treated with 2,562, Pegu coming next with 1,761 cases, and as anticipated, the experiment of establishing a dispensary at the latter place has, I consider, been amply justified. The Pakôkku dispensary did not show quite such a satisfactory result, some 294 cases only being treated during the year. With regard to the dispensary at Prome, the Deputy Commissioner remarks : " The Veterinary Dispensary in spite of its short existence is justifying itself. Roughly over 50 cattle are treated monthly * * * It is hoped that the dispensary will in course of time get better known in the district and will be made more use of than at present." This branch of usefulness of the Department has not been developed in this Province to the extent it has in India, where in 1920 there were 536, being one at nearly every headquarters station, and the results from the four above mentioned dispensaries warrant me recommending that others should be started in many of the larger towns of the Province. Besides providing for the actual treatment of animals they serve as centres of information regarding animals generally, and arouse interest in their care and treatment. To get the full benefit from one of these places, however, sufficiently roomy quarters should be obtained, where, if proving successful, stables and other necessary buildings can be provided. III.14 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPT., BURMA, IV.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1924. 15 16. Veterinary Assistants.16 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPT., BURMA, Both my predecessor and I have visited the scenes of outbreaks as also the Third Superintendent and the Deputy Superintendent. There is no doubt that the District Officers have had a very trying time but their efforts may be said to have been rewarded as the disease has practically died out from the district. The Deputy Commissioner remarks that " agricultural operations which were affected by want of plough cattle are becoming normal again in the townships affected in previous years." The district is also rather unfortunate in its comple- ment of Veterinary Assistants as may be seen from the Deputy Commis- sioner's remarks, " Maung Ba Thein, Veterinary Assistant, who was suspected of corruption has been transferred out of the district. Maung Po Sein, a senior Veterinary Assistant, is charged with falsifying his diaries while on special duty in Homalin Township. He has also been charged for preferring claims for expenses twice for the same month. The matter is under inquiry. Inspector Maung Po Ba and Veterinary Assistant Maung Ba Wi were frequently ill and did not do as much work as they might have. Some of the Veterinary staff in the Paungbyin township are reported to have been dilatory in supervising segregation. This district is not popular with men from elsewhere who are unwilling to work here." The Deputy Commissioner further observes that " the need of a separate Inspector for the Upper Chindwin is also felt, who could go out immediately an outbreak is reported and supervise the work of the Assistants. At present he usually has to be summoned from the Lower Chindwin and arrives only when an outbreak has started to spread. Proposals have been made for training local men at the Veterinary School for appointments in this district, and it is hoped that some will be selected for training this year." I need not say that I fully endorse the Deputy Commissioner's views and the subject will be kept in mind when the next selection of pupils is made. In Lower Burma a satisfactory decrease from last year's figures of some 6,812 deaths from Contagious Diseases has been recorded, viz., 3,799 from Rinderpest, 2,332 from Anthrax and 681 from Foot-and-Mouth disease. From the Upper Burma Districts, however, the mortality from the same causes shows a slight increase to that recorded last year, i.e. 1,915 deaths from Rinderpest, and 236 from Anthrax. Towards the close of the year a slight recrudescence of Rinderpest is reported from the Yamethin District. For the purpose of preparing concisely arranged statistics bearing upon matters connected with the live stock industry of the Province, the services of an additional clerk were temporarily engaged, and as the result of two months' labour charts were completed showing in tabular form the following records from the year 1900 onwards :FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1924. 17 (4) Number of deaths from Anthrax and Blackquarter. (5) Total recorded cattle mortality due to Contagious disease. These tables show the figures for each individual district. In addition, nine other charts were drawn up showing by means of graphs, according to divisions, the information correlated above. By aid of these charts, the incidence of contagious disease in any year and in any district, the mortality therefrom, and the total cattle population, may be seen at a glance. These graphs also clearly demonstrate the cycles of virulence of the above mentioned contagious diseases. Cognisance of these periods is of great importance inasmuch as it enables one to foretell when a parti- cularly virulent outbreak is likely to occur, and by taking reasonable precautions beforehand one should be enabled to minimise the unfortu- nate losses always attendant upon such outbreaks. 18. Segregation Rules.18 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPT., BURMA, even cattle owners who willingly and readily report cases of Rinderpest in their herd and take immediate steps for the suppression of the disease, and who are also ready and willing to have their animals inoculated should be given some awards either in the shape of money or otherwise, not only as an encouragement but in appreciation of their ready and voluntary help and action. In my opinion the educative value of a step of this nature would be very wide and money spent on this account would be more than repaid by gradual decrease of cattle disease. The Deputy Commissioner, Sagaing, observes that " Headmen and villagers are gradually learning the utility of segregation rules but it is the exception to find the rules being carried out properly unless they are ordered to do so. In Sagaing Subdivision it is reported that in most cases no report was made by the villagers concerned and that interest in segregation weakened with the departure of the Veterinary Assistant from the village." In the Kyaiklat township of the Pyapôn District some villages are reported to have maintained segregation camps, while in the Kungyangôn township of the Hanthawaddy District in most of the villages " spacious open grounds have been reserved for segregation of cattle with a view to avoid spread of the disease. In the same township strict orders have been issued to owners of cattle to carefully watch the movement of infected cattle." In some districts notably Pakôkku, Sagaing, Upper Chindwin, Kyaukpyu and Amherst, either the cattle owners or the head- men, or in some cases both, were fined for not carrying out the rules. In the Kyaukpyu District an outbreak of Foot-and-Mouth disease, said to have been imported into the An township by pack cattle from Minbu District, was reported to be checked by the prompt measures taken by the Kyaukpyu Veterinary Assistant and Township Officer, assisted by the Circle Headmen. The Deputy Commissioner, Thatôn, remarks that " Cattle Disease Rules 12 and 13 have been widely made known to all headmen in this district who seem to have realised the importance of the rules and the value of inoculation better than before. Indiscriminate importation of diseased cattle from Siam during the dry season has been a source of great trouble to this district. In order, to regulate the importation a proposal to open a seasonal quarantine station at Shanywathit is under consideration." During the year sanction was accorded for the erection of the Quarantine Station required under the Live-Stock Importation Act at an approximate cost of Rs. 6,000 on a piece of Government land in Culvert Road, Rangoon. Notifications were also issued appointing the Veterinary Officer, Rangoon Corporation, to be an Inspector under Rule 2 of the Act and prescribing the professional fees payable to such officer. The only animals dealt with under this Act have been a few pure bred English cattle imported by private individuals.

Subordinate Establishment.22 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPT., BURMA, FOR THE YEAR ENDE D THE 31ST MARCH 1924. The Deputy Commissioner, Magwe, remarks, " These outbreaks would probably have been more severe but for the careful observance of the segregation rules and the assistance of the Veterinary Officers. These officers spent much more time in affected areas than previously." The Subdivisional Officer, Gangaw, observes, " The actual number of villages Maung Tun Maw visited is 149 against 77 last year which works out to 75 per cent. of the number of villages in the Subdivision. My predecessor has issued an order to the Veterinary Assistants to visit not less than 75 per cent. of villages and Maung Tun Maw is to be congratulated in his successful attempt to comply with the order." The Deputy Commissioner, Myitkyina, writes, " great credit is due to Maung Po Chit who visited all infected areas and took all possible measures to have the sick animals segregated." The work of the following Assistants has been commended by District Officers :APPENDICES. PAGE TABLE 1.24 APPENDICES. TABLE I.

SHEEHY, ESQ., I.C.S., Secretary to the Development Commissioner, Burma, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BURMA, Department of Agriculture, Excise and Forests. Dated Rangoon, the 1st August 1925. SUBJECT.( 2 ) 4. The report of the results of the examinations at the School is satisfactory, and augurs well for the success of the new and enlarged College and Research Institute opened at Insein last February. On the success of the teaching given at Insein will depend much of the efficacy of the reorganization and expansion of the subordinate staff which has been recommended by the Agricultural Committee. 5. Mr. Lewisohn desires to associate himself with Mr. Blake's expression of regret at the death of Sardar Bahadur Bhagwan Singh. Government had no more loyal, respected and hard-working officer. And the Department is also sustaining a heavy loss through the retire- ment after nearly 35 years' service of Mr. J. C. Batlivala, the value of whose work to the Department it would be difficult to over-estimate. 6. Since the Report was written Mr. Rennie has returned from leave and resumed the appointment of Veterinary Adviser. During his two years' absence his duties were performed by Mr. A. Blake. Much of that period has been spent in devising proposals for the re-organization of the Department in all its branches, and the enthusiasm, energy and experience which Mr. Blake brought to this work have been invaluable. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant. J. F. SHEEHY, Secretary.
Report ON THE Civil Veterinary Department, Burma (INCLUDING THE INSEIN VETERINARY SCHOOL) For the Year ended the 31st March 1925. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. 1. Mr. A. Blake was in charge of the Department throughout the year. He visited a large number of districts and toured for 135 days during the year, travelling 7,924 miles by rail, 2,468 by steamer and 4,774 by road. He inspected the office and work of the Officiating Superintendent at Mandalay, 2 Deputy Superintendents, 10 Inspectors and 50 Veterinary Assistants. He likewise attended 5 shows, one each at Meiktila, Allanmyo, Mandalay, Kyauksè and Thatôn, inspected the Military Police Lines at Bhamo, Minbu, Magwe, Myitkyina, and Pyawbwè, and visited the Southern Shan States twice and Northern Shan States once during the year. Captain J. B. Idle : The services of this officer have been transferred from the Agricultural to this Department with effect from 31st December 1924. During the year he has travelled 4,181 miles by rail, 678 by steamer, and 149 by road visiting 12 districts. The number of days spent on tour was 73. He attended three shows, viz. Maymyo Horse Show in October ; Upper Burma Horse Show held at Mandalay in January, and Pony and Cattle Show at Meiktila in December. Since his transfer he has inspected the work of 1 Deputy Superinten- dent, 3 Inspectors and 18 Veterinary Assistants. Captain S. R. Rippon has during the year been engaged on duty in the office. He was out on tour for four days visiting two districts and travelling 1,232 miles by train. He also drew up a revised and enlarged syllabus and regulations for the new Veterinary College at Insein. U Pe Than the officiating Superintendent, is stationed at Mandalay. He travelled 9,160 miles by rail, 203 by steamer and 927 by road. He was out 194 days during the year visiting 14 districts and inspecting the work of 5 Veterinary Inspectors and 50 Assistants. He very
2 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPT., BURMA, materially assisted in organizing the Cattle Shows at Meiktila, Mandalay and Kyauksè, and assisted the Special Officer in judging at these shows. 2. Mr. J. C. Batlivala, Deputy Superintendent, who was granted a third year's extension of service, was in charge of the school throughout the year. In appreciation of his long and meritorious service he was granted a special pay, sanctioned from the date of Mr. Cameron's departure on leave. Mr. Batlivala is due to retire on the 9th September next, previous to which he will avail himself of the amount of leave due to him. Sardar Bahadur Bhagwan Singh, Deputy Superintendent, was in charge of the Military Police ponies up to 16th July when he availed himself of leave preparatory to retirement. It is with the greatest regret I have to record his sudden death on August 9th so that he did not live long to enjoy the pension and rest which he earned after over 40 years service, 32 of which were spent in Burma. I take the opportunity of expressing my deep sense of appreciation of his work. He was not only a thoroughly reliable and hard-working officer, but cheerfully performed whatever duties were assigned to him. He had a personality that made him respected alike in his own community and with others with whom he came into contact. Prior to his taking leave he inspected the Military Police ponies at the following stations,FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1925. 3 2. U Pe was appointed on 29th November 1924, and after under- going training in the office of the officiating third Superintendent, Mandalay, assumed charge of his duties on 1st March 1925 with head- quarters at Mandalay, with the following districts in his charge4 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPT., BURMA, Three graduates of the Rangoon University were sent to England during August to study for the M.R.C.V.S. course. Prior to their sailing they attended the school for a couple of months to get some idea of the work. February the 13th was a red letter day in the history of this Institu- tion when the Foundation Stone of the new Veterinary College and Research Institute was laid by His Excellency the Governor in the presence of a large and representative gathering. His Excellency was met at the school by the Hon'ble U Pu, Minister for Agriculture, Excise and Forests, who, after introducing the officials connected with the institution, invited His Excellency to lay the foundation stone. In the course of his speech the Hon'ble Minister pointed out the great importance of an effective veterinary service in a country so entirely dependent on Agriculture as Burma, and promised that Government would give sympathetic consideration to any proposals calculated to improve the status and efficiency of the department. The work on the new building will, I understand, be taken in hand very shortly.

The Deputy Commissioner remarks that " a scheme for a Seasonal Quarantine Station at Shanywathit in the Hlaingbwe Township was started for the first time in the month of October 1924 and a Reserve Veterinary Assistant posted there to control the importa- tion of infected cattle from Siam." The Deputy Commissioner further observes, and I fully endorse what he says, that "there are considerable difficulties in the way of controlling infection if brought from across the border. Villages are few and far between ; there is in the Hlaingbwe Township, only one Police Station and it is by no means impossible for caravans to decamp in the night if they find the eye of authority on them. It has been suggested that a small police patrol should assist the Veterinary Assistant at Shanywathit ; but with crime as it is in the district the men cannot be found. " (4) Salween District, where the disease broke out in the Kawludo Circle, bordering on the Karenni border, in December. The disease is said to have been imported by bullocks brought down by caravans from Karenni for sale, one party going down to Kyaukkyi in the Toungoo District and the other to Bilin in the Thatôn District. The Deputy Commissioner observes that " inoculation is useless in these parts because it takes too long to get up an inoculation party. The reports of the outbreaks are usually received late and when the Veterinary Assistant is sent out to the place, he generally is too late to do anything beyond taking necessary precautions to prevent further spread of the disease under the rules." Anthrax.8 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPT., BURMA, prevent the spread of disease." In the Yamethin District, on the other hand, it is remarked that " cases of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease have fallen down to half when compared with that of last year's figures. This is due to prompt precautions being taken by both the headmen and the Veterinary Assistants." In the Magwe District rinderpest broke out in the Taungdwingyi Township and was responsible for some 857 deaths. The Magwe Town- ship also suffered but not to the same extent. The Deputy Commissioner remarks that " another factor which assists the spread of the disease is probably the practice of villagers from other areas entering the infected areas for the purchase of paddy and other food grains, and thus spreading the disease." The Upper Chindwin District, where the losses have been enormous for the past two years, fortunately escaped during the year. In the Bhamo District the disease was still prevailing in the Myothit Circle of the Bhamo Subdivision towards the close of the year and inoculation operations were proceeding. Four hundred and fifty-seven deaths from rinderpest were reported from the Mandalay District. Anthrax, etc.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1925. 9 The Tawngpeng State was not entirely free ; some 48 animals are said to have suffered and recovered. The disease is reported in this State to have broken out generally among pack animals of caravans travelling through the country ; the officiating Superintendent, Northern Shan States, informs us that " Segregation was a difficult matter especially as reports of outbreaks were often received after caravans had left the district." Some 19 deaths from anthrax and 98 from foot-and-mouth disease were also reported10 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPT., BURMA, In the South-Eastern Subdivision there were five cases, and in the Central Subdivision ten cases, in which all persons responsible were fined by the Sawbwas for infringement of rules. Twol pupils from the Taunggyi School were given appointments during the year. One Assistant was sentenced to one year's rigorous imprisonment (sentence was afterwards reduced) on a charge of house trespass, while one was removed in June. The Assistant Superintendent, Yawnghwe State, observes, that " the results of the Veterinary Assistant's work and the distribution of copies of the manual of cattle disease and notifications amongst the cattle owners appears to have had a good effect. The state has been very free from cattle diseases and this is particularly satisfactory in view of the fact that the neighbouring subdivisions, Western and Central, have had very heavy mortality amongst cattle due to Rinderpest. The Inspector visited eleven villages, attended twenty-one outbreaks and was three days out on tour, treating 226 cases. The Assistants treated 21,387 cases, attended 236 outbreaks and were 70.4 days out on an average. The Veterinary School, Taunggyi, was inspected twice during the year by me. The usual examinations were held, and considering the extremely restricted course and means of instruction, the results were not less satisfactory than one could expect. Eight pupils were under training at the School towards the close of the year. Maung Po Ku, Veterinary Inspector, has been in charge of the school throughout the year. The school has now been moved to a new building, more commodious and, as it is off the main road, more conducive to concentration on their work on the part of the pupils. (2) Preventive Inoculation. Table III. 11. Anti-Rinderpest inoculations were carried out in thirteen districts in Lower Burma, viz. Akyab, Rangoon, Hanthawaddy, Insein, Pegu, Prome, Tharrawaddy, Toungoo, Thayetmyo, Bassein, Henzada, Amherst and Thaton, and ten in Upper Burma, viz. Shwebo, Sagaing, Mandalay, Kyaukse, Meiktila, Myingyan, Yamethin, Magwe, Minbu, and Bhamo, in addition to both the Shan States. Sixty-three thousand, two hundred and five animals were inoculated, viz. 22,843 in Lower Burma, 38,289 in Upper Burma, 1,868 in the Northern and 205 in the Southern Shan States. The demand for serum was so great that stocks were frequently exhausted and owing to the fact that Burma has no serum station of its own, and serum has still to be obtained from Muktesar, inoculation operations were seriously hampered on many occasions. The Deputy Commissioner, Bhamo, observes that " the benefits of inoculation are plain to the Shan-Burmese and Shan-Chinese inhabitants of remote villages who looked upon this measure with
FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1925. 11 suspicion in the past." The Deputy Commissioner, Kyaukse, remarks as follows :12 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPT., BURMA, Commissioner, Prome, remarks that " the Veterinary dispensary in spite of its short existence is a boon to the public. The people in general are now more or less getting familiar with the good work done both in the dispensary and by the Veterinary Staff." The Agricultural Committee considered the question of the increase in the number of dispensaries, when discussing the reorganisation of this Department, and came to the conclusion that many more could be established with benefit, and now that the experimental stage has been passed, proving their usefulness, it is to be hoped that District Councils and Municipalities, who are mainly responsible for their maintenance, will see their way to cooperate with the Government in the opening and maintaining of many more of these institutions. III.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1925. 13 placed on special duty in connection with cattle mortality and insurance at the request of the Registrar of Co-operative Societies. The Inspectors in Lower Burma visited 1,213 villages and attended 206 outbreaks. On an average each Inspector was 139.9 days on tour. In Upper Burma 2,093 villages were visited and 289 outbreaks attended to by the Inspector, while 234.6 days were spent on tour by each. In the Southern Shan States the one Inspector in addition to his duties at the Taunggyi School visited 11 villages, and attended four outbreaks, and was out for three days. 16. Veterinary Assistants14 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPT., BURMA, Some of the rise in the recorded figures is quite possibly due to the greater interest which is being displayed by district officials in endeavour- ing to obtain more correct figures than has hitherto been the case. In many previous reports my predecessors have continually drawn attention to the obviously incomplete and incorrect methods of recording the deaths of animals both from Contagious and non-Contagious diseases. The following table which has been compiled for the last four quinquennial periods from figures returned from the districts makes this even more emphatic. Table showing average number of Cattle mortality from Contagious diseasesFOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1925. 15 that progress in the matter of observance of these rules is satisfactory, and that the headmen, cattle owners and villagers begin to appreciate the value of early report of the outbreak and immediate segregation of the animals. The remarks made by the Subdivisianal Officer, Nyaunglebin, are very pertinent. He observes that "it seems that the majority of cattle owners are beginning to realize the importance of segregation, as taught by experience. There is no doubt that the more the masses realize the efficacy of the rules regarding segregation, the better they will appre- ciate them. But the difficulty which cannot easily be overcome is the fact that a prompt report of an outbreak of cattle disease is seldom, if ever, made to headmen. Experience has shown that such report is usually made after the disease has commenced to spread." In the Kungyangon South Township of the Hanthawaddy District the Subdivisional Officer remarks " in most of the villages spacious open grounds have been reserved for segregation of infected cattle," whereas in Kungyangon North Township of the same district in addition to this, red flags are fixed near the camps as a warning to other cattle owners to avoid these sites for grazing their animals. In the Hlaingbwe Township of the Amherst District it was found necessary to establish a Quarantine Station near the Shanywathit village of the Siamese Frontier to prevent indiscriminate importation of diseased cattle from Siam during the dry season." In spite of this, however, the Veterinary Assistant, Shanywathit reported that two herds of Siamese cattle passed the village without permission and in spite of the fact that they were ordered into quarantine at that place. All the village headmen on main routes of communications were ordered to look out for these herds and the drivers traced and detained at once, and prosecuted under the Village Act. In some districts, e.g. Sagaing, Lower Chindwin, Shwebo, and Sandoway, some headmen and villagers had to be punished for non-observance of the rules, whereas in the Thayetmyo District out of nine headmen who were commended by the Veterinary Assistant for good work in the suppression of Rinderpest, two were recommended to the Commissioner, Pegu Division, for special rewards and the good work of the others has been noted in the Register of village headmen. The Veterinary Officer, Rangoon Corporation, reports that during the year 2 cows, 1 bull and 1 horse were imported into Rangoon under Rule XII of the Rules framed under the Live Stock Importation Act, all of which passed the prescribed tests as to freedom from disease. The Quarantine Station as prescribed under the Act was completed during the year and is fully adequate to meet any ordinary requirements. 19. Subordinate Establishment.16 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPT., BURMA, The Inspectors and Assistants deserving mention are : Maung Po Thet, Maung Pe, Veterinary Inspectors, Maung Tun Nyet and Maung Po Tun, acting Veterinary Inspectors, and Assistants Maung Po Soung, Allanmyo ; Hla Gyaw, Bassein ; Maung Moung, Shwebo ; Maung Tun Pa, Myanaung ; Khin Gyi, Kyaunggon ; La Zan Ta Nauk, Sinlumkaba ; Maung Tha, Sale ; Maung Zin, Wetlet; and Maung Kyaw and Maung Tha Kyu, both attached to Headquarters in Rangoon. 20. During the year a scheme for the general reorganization of the Department including the Veterinary School at Insein has been submitted. This has been considered by the Agricultural Committee who also examined a considerable number of members of the Staff and recorded their evidence. The report of this Committee has now been published and it is gratifying to note that the majority of the recommendations made in the original scheme have been approved. Amongst the more important of these may be mentioned the division of the Province into circles each under the charge of a Superintendent. It must be remembered that in dealing with Contagious Diseases of any kind, promptness of action is one of the first considerations and the principal effects of these Circle Superintendents, who will immediately be able to concentrate all the Staff at their disposal on an outbreak at its commencement, must be obvious, and should go far to reduce the spread of mortality from these diseases. It is also expected that these Superintendents will, by their knowledge of local conditions, be able to obtain more reliable statistics of the deaths of animals, as well as a more correct diagnosis of the causes of such deaths. The appointment of special Superintendents on Research, Breeding and Education have also been advised, whilst the addition of sufficient Lecturers, etc., at the Insein School under the Superintendent (Educa- cation), should, when the new school is completed, ensure the Province a sufficient number of well-trained and efficient Veterinary Assistants under very much more liberal terms of recruitment than have hitherto existed. 21. The success of this Department's work depends so largely on the cooperation and interest of District Officials that it is a pleasure to record that as in past years, these have once more been very ungrudg- ingly bestowed and every possible assistance given in furthering any measures for the prevention and spread of disease. A. BLAKE, Special Officer, Civil Veterinary Department, Burma.

PAGE General Administration 1 to 3 1Resolution ON THE Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Burma (including the Insein Veterinary School) FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1926. Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Burma, Agricultural Depart- ment (Ministry of Forests) No. 219-O, dated the 16th October 1926. READBURMA No. 270( 2 ) the hundred for lack of it, appears to the Development Commissioner to indicate that the question of establishing our own serum depot in Burma must be taken up seriously. Shortage of officers in the Imperial Service is at present a serious obstacle, but when this has been overcome by the appointment of the research officers now under recruitment, there appears to be no reason why a depot for the manufacture and storage of serum should not be opened in connection with the Veterinary School, Insein. An additional argument in favour of the establishment of such a depot is the high cost of the serum obtained from Muktesar. During the year under review no less than Rs. 77,500 was spent on this alone and the Development Commissioner considers that the Department would probably effect a considerable saving here if it possessed its own depot. 5. The position as regards dispensaries is not encouraging. The number of cases treated during the year shows an appreciable decrease on the 1924-25 figures. Until these institutions are better appreciated and more extensively used by the public, the Development Commissioner deprecates, any further expansion of the Department's activities in this branch of its work. 6. The Department suffered considerably during the year under review from a shortage of superior staff which finally necessitated it being placed temporarily under the control of the Director of Agriculture. In spite of difficulties however the Department has on the whole done a good year's work and the Development Commissioner is pleased to note that a goodly number of Inspectors and Assistants are singled out for special mention. The Development Commissioner himself desires to place on record his acknowledgment of good work done by Mr. McKerral, who took over charge of the Department, in addition to his already onerous duties as Director of Agriculture on the 1st January 1926, and by Captain Rippon who has been the backbone of the Depart- ment throughout a difficult year. 7. There is, however, one criticism which the Development Commis- sioner wishes to make and this concerns the touring of Veterinary Inspectors and Assistants. The averages generally represent a consider- able improvement on those given in last year's report particularly in the case of Inspectors in Lower Burma but are still not entirely satisfactory. A Veterinary Inspector should even in a normal year be on tour at least 240 days and Mr. Chalmers is disposed to consider that in a year such as 1925-26 in which contagious disease has been so rife both Veterinary Inspectors and Assistants should have been on tour more than they have been. Possibly, however, shortage of rinderpest serum has hampered touring. The Development Commissioner also notes with regret that it has been found necessary to send out students on protracted inoculation tours but realises that at present this cannot be helped. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, W. Q. TAGGART, Officiating Secretary.
Report ON THE Civil Veterinary Department, Burma (INCLUDING THE INSEIN VETERINARY SCHOOL) For the Year ended the 31st March 1926. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. 1. During the year under report no fewer than four different officers have been in charge of the Department. Mr. A. Blake held charge until the 13th July 1925, as Special Officer, when he handed over to Mr. T. Rennie, who on return from leave had assumed charge of his duties as Veterinary Adviser on 6th July. Mr. Rennie's health unfortunately soon broke down and he was compelled to proceed on leave on 20th October 1925, after making over to Captain Rippon who held charge of the office until January 1st, 1926, when Mr. McKerral, Director of Agriculture, assumed charge of the department in addition to his own duties. Mr. McKerral was in charge until the end of the year. Mr. C. J. N, Cameron retired from the Department on 29th December 1925. Captain J. B. Idle had his headquarters at Rangoon until 11th January 1926, when he was transferred to Meiktila. He proceeded on leave on 10th March 1926. Captain S. R. Rippon's headquarters have remained at Rangoon throughout the year. In May he was sent in response to an urgent telegram from the Chief Commissioner to investigate an outbreak of disease amongst the Military Police ponies at Port Blair in the Andaman Islands. On 5th June 1925 he took over charge of the Veterinary School at Insein, and upon Mr. Rennie proceeding on leave in October he was placed temporarily in charge of the Office of Veterinary Adviser. He visited the Veterinary School at Taunggyi, Southern Shan States, in January, in order to hold the final examination of pupils who had completed their course of study. In March he proceeded to the Siamese frontier to inspect the quarantine stations established at Thingan- nyinaung and Shanywathit in Amherst and Thatôn Districts respectively.
2 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPT., BURMA, 2. U Pe Than, Officiating Superintendent, continued to be stationed at Mandalay. He took over the Veterinary duties of Captain Idle, in addition to his own, when the latter officer proceeded on leave in March 1926. Mr. J. C. Batlivala, Deputy Superintendent, was in charge of the Veterinary School, Insein, until the 4th June 1925, when he proceeded on leave for 3 months and 4 days preparatory to retirement. During his 34 years' service he had a large share in the training of the majority of the subordinate staff of the Department and was well liked and respected by his seniors and juniors alike. He always gave of his best and will carry with him the best wishes of all with whom he was associated during the course of his long and meritorious career. U Tun Aung, Deputy Superintendent, continued in charge of the Pakôkku, Minbu, Magwe and Thayetmyo Districts with headquarters at Magwe. As in the previous year U Nyan Kyaw was in charge of Bassein, Henzada, Myaungmya, Ma-ubin and Pyapôn Districts with headquarters at Bassein. U Kyaing, Deputy Superintendent, was in charge of the Tenasserim Sub-Circle throughout the year. U San Hla, Deputy Superintendent, on probation, continued in charge of his duties at the Veterinary School as Lecturer and Laboratory Assistant during the year. He was confirmed in his appointment with effect from the 13th October 1925. U Pe (2), Deputy Superintendent, on probation, continued to be in charge of Mandalay, Bhamo, Katha, Myitkyina and Putao Districts with headquarters at Mandalay till the end of January 1926. He assumed charge of the Shwebo Sub-Circle with headquarters at Shwebo on the forenoon of the 4th February 1926. He was confirmed in his appoint- ment with effect from the 29th November 1925. U Po Thin, Deputy Superintendent, on probation, was from the beginning of the year in charge of the Lower and Upper Chindwin, Sagaing and Shwebo Districts with headquarters at Sagaing. He was subsequently placed in charge of the Lower Chindwin Sub-Circle comprising Mandalay, Sagaing, Lower Chindwin, Upper Chindwin and the Chin Hills with headquarters at Mônywa where he assumed charge on the forenoon of the 4th February 1926. He was confirmed in his appointment with effect from the 1st January 1926. Tables IV & VII. 3. Subordinate Establishment.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1926. 3 deputed to Thayetmyo and Pakôkku Districts and at the end of the year he was still employed in the latter district. Veterinary Inspector U Ko Ko Gyi who had been placed on special duty in connection with cattle mortality and insurance at the request of the Registrar of Co-operative Societies completed these duties on 4th August 1925 and in the same month proceeded to Akyab District for inoculation duty on which he was engaged until the end of November. The Inspectors in Lower Burma visited 2,068 villages, and attended 381 outbreaks. Each Inspector was out on an average of 232.1 days. In Upper Burma Inspectors visited 2,051 villages, attended 489 outbreaks and were out for a total of 2,468 days, or an average of 205.7 days for each Inspector. This includes the work done by the Flying Column Inspector.

During the year the Museum has been enriched by the addition of a camel skeleton. The animal had been destroyed at the Zoological Gardens and its bones presented to the school. The bones were pre- pared and set up by U Tun Nyein of the school staff. The Assistant Teachers.6 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPT., BURMA, the incubative stage of the disease. The Deputy Commissioner, Akyab, remarks that " The epidemic might have been checked at the outset if the co-operation of the village headmen and the cattle owners could have been obtained, but it has been difficult to persuade an extremely ignorant people of the advantages to be derived from segregation and inoculation ". The disease was introduced into Kyaukpyu District by traders bringing diseased cattle from Akyab District and resulted in 612 deaths, whilst 679 inoculations were carried out. The outbreak confined itself to the An and Myebôn Townships where communications when existent are bad. The Deputy Commissioner states that although these two townships are tinder a single Veterinary Assistant they are liable to far more disease and danger of disease than the remaining three townships put together. It is proposed to post a further Assistant to the charge of the Myebôn Township. Sandoway District also suffered heavily, losing 818 cattle in three townships. The Deputy Commissioner mentions particularly good work done by the headmen in Taungup Township, and by the district Veterinary Assistant in suppressing the outbreak. Altogether 1,002 cattle were inoculated. Anthrax.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1926. Six hundred and Sixteen deaths from the same cause are reported from Toungoo District, where also inoculation was performed, 3,059 cattle receiving protective doses of serum. In Amherst District the disease was most severe in Kyaikmaraw Township, from whence it spread to Mudôn Township. Altogether there were 331 deaths, inoculation on an extensive scale undoubtedly keeping the mortality down. Protection in this way was given to 3,865 cattle. Anthrax.8 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPT., BURMA, Bassein District record 143 deaths, which include 5 reported cases of Blackquarter and 21 of Hæmorrhagic Septicaemia in Kyaunggôn Township. Other deaths under this head include 61 in Ma-ubin, 56 in Prome, and 52 in Henzada Districts, respectively. Foot and Mouth Disease.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1926. 9 all outbreaks which have occurred throughout the year whether or not they were visited by the Veterinary Establishment or entered in the records. It is necessarily very rough. It is, however, an attempt to show the total mortality for the year. In theory the figures of the Veterinary Establishment and the figures of the circle headmen would agree. In fact with small staff, bad communication, and large areas, agreement is at present impossible10 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPT., BURMA, Foot and Mouth Disease.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1926. 11 gratifying to note that no opposition was offered to inoculate anywhere. Rinderpest has been successfully stamped out. The villagers generally appreciate the value of inoculation and they readily come forward to have their cattle inoculated by the Veterinary Assistants." From several sources complaints have been made with regard to difficulty in getting prompt and adequate supplies of serum. Serum is obtained from Muktesar and every effort is made to meet all normal demands by keeping supplies in cold storage in Rangoon. The delay in some cases in meeting the requirements was due mainly to the unpre- cedented demands which were made. In one instance also a supply was held up at Calcutta owing to the Puja holidays, while on another occasion a consignment was sent by mistake to Singapore. (3) Other Diseases. 13.

The highest mortality recorded from Rinderpest during the year was 12,865 from the Northern Shan States ; from Anthrax 318 in Myaungmya ; and from Foot and Mouth Disease 1,566 in the Southern Shan States. 17. Segregation Rules.14 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPT., BURMA, FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1926. 19. The department has now been placed temporarily under the Agricultural Department, with the Director of Agriculture as the Officer- in-charge. This change was effected on January 1st, and on the same date the Province was divided into 4 Circles and a Sub-circle, as recommended by the Agricultural Committee 1925. So far, however the superintending staff has not been augmented and the circle charges are divided between the existing small staff. The charge of the Veterinary School is now regarded as part of the normal duties of the Superintendent in charge South-Eastern Circle. It is to be hoped that the reorganisation of the department will not be unduly delayed, as until the extra teaching, research and field staff are recruited very little progress can be made towards putting Veterinary science in the province on a sound basis. 20. As in previous years the department is largely indebted to the District Officials, who have always been ready to help in every way in what is, and must be for years to come, exceedingly uphill work. Without their co-operation the Veterinary Staff would often find them- selves severely handicapped, and they must be heartened by the know- ledge that assistance from District Officials is always forthcoming. Finally I would like to express my thanks to Captain S. R. Rippon, I.V.S., for help in the preparation of the report and compilation of statistics. T. D. STOCK, Director of Agriculture, and Officer-in-charge Civil Veterinary Department, Burma, Rangoon.

No. 469( 2 ) have been various criticisms and suggestions in past years and various difficulties tending to prevent the achievement of effective control have been mentioned. The suggestions include quarantine on the frontiers and improvement of the mobility of the staff of Veterinary Assistants. The difficulties mentioned include deficiency and delay in the supply of serum for inoculation against rinderpest, the insufficient number of the staff qualified to perform inoculations, the effect of large unfenced grazing grounds in spreading the disease and the apathy of the people and their failure to appreciate the necessity for the prompt reporting of outbreaks and the value of segregation. 4. As regards the apathy of the public, Mr. Lewisohn, in commenting on the Report for 1924-25, remarked that it " will only disappear slowly in the course of generations with the gradual spread of education and the development of civic spirit." Cases, however, have been known in which the rural population in some localities in Upper Burma have taken it upon themselves to stop the transit of cattle through their villages for fear of cattle disease and Mr. Dunn does not think it necessary to give up all hope of improvement in this matter until the passing of generations has evolved civic spirit without the conscious efforts of individuals and governments. The Ministry of Education in its recent Resolution on proposals for the improvement of the Local Government (No. 399U27, dated the 15th July 1927) has raised the question what measures are advisable with regard to the control of the Veterinary staff by the local government bodies and whether it is expedient to amend the rules for the prevention of cattle disease so as to transfer certain powers and duties from the district officers to the local bodies. The present arrangement is a triple control by the Veterinary Department, the district officers and the district councils. The veterinary problem has some analogy to the problem of public health improvement. With regard to the latter the opinion of Dr. Bentley, the Director of Public Health in Bengal, and other authorities in India and Burma is that the only means by which rapid and general progress can be secured is by making use of local government authorities as agencies for carrying out and popularising public health improvements. 5. It seems to be impracticable, however, to localise completely the measures for dealing with outbreaks of rinderpest which threaten to sweep over Burma. The Department is in favour of completely centralising the control of the staff to be employed for this work and of giving to this staff the maximum mobility. In the case of veterinary dispensaries, on the other hand, the increase of which was recommended by the Burma Agricultural Committee (1925) and by Messrs. Cameron and Blake in annual reports of the Department the localisation of control seems to be preferable : and if dispensaries can be increased in number and provided with sufficient stabling they may be a means of spreading confidence in western methods of veterinary treatment. The number of cases treated at dispensaries shows an increase and in spite of Mr. McKerral's remark in paragraph 15 of this report that "a further step in this direction would hardly seem justified at present," Mr. Dunn would like to have this matter further considered. 6. The subordinate field staff was largely increased in 1926. A Research Officer is being obtained from South Africa and enquiries are being made with a view to obtaining a second research officer. Mr. McKerral is of opinion that the strengthening of the superior field staff, that is, Superintendents with training in western countries, is even more urgently important than the appointment of research officers with
( 3 ) regard to the collecting of information and the devising of plans for dealing with the main problem of rinderpest. It is hoped that proposals will shortly be submitted to Government on this subject. 7. The Officiating Financial Commissioner (Transferred Subjects) has little personal knowledge of the work of the officers who are commented upon in the last paragraph of the Report. It is to be recorded to the honour of the Veterinary College that 2 members of the teaching staff and 2 pupils had to be treated for rabies during the year. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, SAW HLA PRU, Secretary.

Going back still further it is recorded that in 1895-96 in the Akyab District alone 42,309 cattle died from Rinderpest, this figure being nearly as high as the present year's figure for the whole province. 17. Supply of Serum.12. REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPT., BURMA, Inspector. During the year I discussed this. latter subject with the Development Commissioner and it was agreed that the Senior Veterinary Assistant in each district should be supplied with an inoculation chest. The District Councils are now being asked to provide for these. The Deputy Commissioner, Mergui, complains that he has experienced difficulty in checking the work of Veterinary Assistants and recommends the introduction of a register similar to the vaccination register so that all cases attended by Veterinary Assistants can be checked by touring officers. This matter is being looked into. The old evil of cattle owners selling the hides and flesh of diseased cattle is again referred to this year by the Deputy Commissioner, Amherst District. He states : " Such instances though rare always created widespread disease." This is an offence which requires exemplary punishment. In Arakan the Deputy Commissioner of Akyab states that difficulties have been experienced in getting the people to inoculate at newly infected places and he mentions that it is particularly difficult to get Chittagonians to realize the value of inoculation. In this division the real evil seems to be that the carcases of diseased animals instead of being buried are flung into the tidal creeks thus helping to spread the disease. Another difficulty mentioned by the Deputy Commissioner is the extreme reluctance of headmen to punish those who disregard the rules and he states that he is at present dealing with a number of headmen whose failure to enforce the rules has caused outbreaks to assume far more serious proportions than they need have done and that he is making it widely known that headmen who show zeal in enforcing the rules will be granted liberal money rewards. A serious obstacle to the stamping out of disease and one which is general to nearly all Lower Burma districts is the communal grazing of cattle on unfenced grazing grounds. Despite these drawbacks there is good reason to believe that both in the matter of inoculation and of the enforcement of the segregation rules the education of the people is progressing. 19.

Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Burma, Agricultural Department (Ministry of Forests), No. 270-O, dated the 5th November 1928. READLetter No. 347( 2 ) preventive measures. A graph showing the fluctuations of the Provincial statistics of rinderpest mortality is included in the report. Other graphs of District statistics were recently prepared under the instructions of Mr. Lister, I.C.S., who was then working in the office of the Financial Commissioner. It has not been found possible yet to draw any satisfactory inferences from these graphs as to the periodicity of extensive outbreaks, or even as to the routes by which the disease travels over the province. In spite of the disappointing results of the graphs and the defectiveness of the statistics available, Mr. Dunn thinks that graphs should continue to be included in the annual report of the department and that the examination and improvement of statistics should be extended. 5. The question of altering the standard of instruction given at the Insein Veterinary School must be settled without much further delay. The Royal Commission on Agriculture did not generally attempt to solve problems such as this which are more or less peculiar to a single Province and the Commission seems to have contemplated a class of Veterinary Assistants able to understand text books in English.
REPORT ON THE Civil Veterinary Department, Burma For the Year ended the 31st March 1928. CHAPTER I.2 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, among bovines during the year is 108,747 made up of 41,955 deaths due to contagious diseases and 66,792 deaths due to other diseases. The total bovine population as recorded in the Season and Crop Report is given as 5,994,840. This figure is obtained from a yearly census made by Deputy Commissioners. It is unlikely to be on the high side and much more likely to be an underestimate. The figure for total mortality works out at 1.8 per cent. of the bovine population which would put the average lite of each bovine at about 50 years whereas it is known to be not more than 15. Mr. Mitchell, temporary Veterinary Research Officer, has kindly supplied me with the South African figures which give a mortality of slightly over 7 per cent. or a life period of about 14 years. There is, therefore, good reason to suppose that the recorded figure for total mortality is at least three times too small and this figure will doubtless apply both to animals that have died of contagious diseases and from other causes. If we assume that the error from year to year is fairly constant then the figures may be of some value for compara- tive purposes and it is probable also that the figures for RinderpestFOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1928. 3 Kyaukpyu, Sandoway, the Arakan Hill Tracts and Tavoy.

He states : " Reports of outbreaks of disease have been promptly attended to by segregation and the prohibition of movements of cattle into or through the affected village-tract." The outbreak in this district has apparently passed its zenith. 6. The Thatôn Outbreak.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1928. 5 than Rinderpest from the mortality point of view, often seriously embarrasses the cultivators by incapacitating their plough bullocks at the time that they are required for cultivation. The disease is amenable to curative treatment and the existence of dispensaries would be a boon to cultivators in this respect. All cultivators should know the curative treatment to be adopted for this disease, but until dispensaries are established where the required medicines can be obtained little can be done. The Veterinary Assistants are supposed to treat it, but obviously can only deal with a very small proportion of the animals affected. 10. For the three diseases which are linked together to form one group. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, Black Quarter and Anthrax, the recorded deaths are 1,598 against 990 for last year. Mr. Mitchell, the newly recruited Research Officer, is preparing leaflets on Anthrax and Black Quarter, which it is hoped to distribute widely among cultivators. He is also working on the production of protective vaccines for these two diseases. The above figures do not include the mortality among working elephants which is commented on later in the paragraph dealing with veterinary research. CHAPTER III.6 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, valued at about £5,000,000 perished from the disease. The measures taken to suppress it consisted of the complete prohibition of movements of animals from infected to non-infected areas and the complete slaugh- ter of diseased and in-contact-with diseased animals in farms where the disease had broken out. These measures without the use of serum, which was not then available, completely stamped out the disease. We cannot, however, put these in force in Burma. We cannot, without paralysing the economic life of the people, completely stop the move- ments of animals at times when they are required for cultivating the land or conveying its produce to the market. The slaughter of animals is outside the question and in any case, apart from religious objections, it would be unworkable in a country where the cultivators live in villages instead of in isolated farms. Bearing in mind these facts the only conclusion which can be drawn is that, by the measures which are now available, contagious disease may be mitigated but it will be diffi- cult entirely to eradicate it. The third of the evils mentioned aboveFOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1928. 7 although certain members of the staff occasionally give lectures at pagoda festivals and elsewhere this kind of itinerant instruction has not been as systematic as it should have been. The attention of Superin- tendents is being drawn to the matter. CHAPTER IV.8 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, the proposal. Attempts were at once made to get men to fill these posts but this was found to be a matter of much difficulty. One of the posts, however, has been temporarily filled during the year by the appointment of Mr. D. T. Mitchell, M.R.C.V.S., who had been in the employ of the Government of the Union of South Africa which seconded him for one year's service in Burma to advise on the organization of veterinary research in this province. Mr. Mitchell arrived in December 1927 and proceeded at once to examine the laboratory arrangements at the Insein Veterinary School and the Agricultural College, Mandalay. He found that neither of these is in its present condition suitable for a routine laboratory for the production of Rinderpest serum. Later he inspected the site at Meiktila proposed in 1908 for a dry zone farm for the Agri- cultural Department and this site he pronounced to be well suited for the purpose in view. Estimates are being worked out for the cost of land, buildings and equipment for a routine laboratory on this site. Mr. Mitchell has subsequently visited again the Agricultural College site at Mandalay and has somewhat modified the opinion which he first formed. If a site can be found at Mandalay great economies could be effected in the matter of buildings and much benefit might result from the Veterinary Research Officers working in close touch with the other specialists of the Agricultural Department. It is hoped to come to a decision as soon as the estimates have been prepared. 17. The small laboratory at the Veterinary School, Insein, was found to be quite unsuitable for the work on Rinderpest, but Mr. Mitchell considered that with some slight structural alterations it could be made suitable for work on vaccines for Anthrax and Black Quarter. These alterations are now being put in hand by the Public Works Department. 18. In order to understand the conditions under which elephants and buffaloes are kept in the timber camps and to make enquiries regarding the manner of outbreaks of disease and present methods of dealing with it, Mr. Mitchell visited certain of the camps of some of the larger timber firms early in the year. He has now begun a programme of research at Insein which in the immediate future will be along the following lines :FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1928. 9 lone, of the provinces of India, is the elephant an important domes- icated animal. The total number of domesticated elephants in this province is, according to a figure supplied to me by the Chief Conservator of Forests, about 5,600. The capital value of these is probably in the neighbourhood of three crores of rupees and the total annual loss due to contagious diseases calculated from figures which have been supplied to me by some of the timber firms must work out at between five and six akhs of rupees per annum. This is not the only loss. In addition we have got to take into consideration the dislocation of work that is caused oy an outbreak of Anthrax in any of these camps. I cannot provide gures for this, but it is clear that it must be very large. The main con_ agious disease among elephants is Anthrax and the discovery of a protective vaccine for Anthrax in elephants is, Mr. Mitchell assures me, lot likely to be a particularly difficult matter although a large number of ests will have to be made before the correct quantities and strengths for noculation are determined.

Laboratory.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1928. 11 22, These dispensaries are supposed to be run by the District Councils which budget for the medicine and other contingent expenditure, the Provincial Government providing the pay of the Assistants in charge. The Municipality should certainly be called upon to pay half the cost. Enquiry shows that the inhabitants within the limits of the Municipality were the main users of these dispensaries. The District Councils appear to take little interest in them although the provision of institutions and staff to deal with the ordinary ailments of cattle and the supply of drugs appear to be legitimate and workable services for the District Councils and Municipalities. These local bodies should be encouraged to erect dispensaries at suitable places where cattle owners could come and obtain the medicines necessary for the treatment of foot-and-mouth disease and ordinary ailments of their cattle. There is no reason why drugs should be dis- tributed free. The Agricultural Department which distributes seeds in large quantities to cultivators gets paid at market rates, and general experience goes to prove that only things that have to be paid for are accounted of any value. The Deputy Commissioners might be instructed to encourage these local bodies in the creation of dispensaries with the help and advice of the Veterinary Department. CHAPTER VII.12 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, applicants have been received, of which only one came from a High School Final candidate. It has, therefore, been necessary to postpone the meeting of the Board for the selection of stipendiaries and to stop recruitment until such time as a suitable policy of veterinary instruction has been decided on. 25. As a result of complaints received from Superintendents relating to the low standard of efficiency exhibited by many Veterinary Assistants it has been decided to institute refresher courses for the district staff beginning from 1st September 1928, each course to be of three months' duration. The Assistants:who attend these courses will be given training in inoculation and in general veterinary practice. It is hoped to take in 30 to 40 Assistants in each batch. The Veterinary School at Taunggyi has been closed since July 1927. CHAPTER VIII.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1928. 13 was 205 days and in Upper Burma 172 days. An Inspector should certainly be on tour for not less than 20 days in the month. The Superintendents are being instructed in this matter. The average touring of Veterinary Assistants is 236 days in Lower Burma and 244 days in Upper Burma. This may be regarded as satisfactory. Many reports sent in by the Superintendents complain of the low standard of efficiency of not only the Veterinary Assistants but of certain Inspectors. It is stated that they are frequently ignorant of such elementary facts as the gestation period and dentition of the domesticated animals and are unable to calculate the body weight of an animal or to take the temperature satisfactorily. As an immediate remedy I am arranging as stated above to have refresher courses started at the Insein Veterinary School beginning from September this year. 28. A matter which requires the most serious consideration is the policy to be adopted with regard to veterinary instruction. In the past this has been entirely in the vernacular and so far as I know this is the only branch of technical instruction in Burma which is so taught. Vernacular instruction has now been abolished in the Punjab Veterinary College14 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, from the graduates of the Insein Veterinary College must be obtained by promotion in the future the members of the Provincial Service. It has also been proposed that of the new Superior Service cadre 20 per cent. shall be recruited by promotion from Class II of the service. An English course would, therefore, appear to be imperative. The Royal Commission on Agriculture may perhaps in its report give a lead in the matter. One method out of the difficulty would appear to be to abolish the grade of Veterinary Assistants altogether and replace it by a grade on a scale of pay not less than that drawn by the present Inspectors. When the Agricultural Committee of 1925 naively suggested that High School Final candidates could be got to undergo a three-year course in veterinary science and then start on an initial pay of Rs. 50, they must have overlooked the fact that High School Finalists can, as soon as they pass, obtain a clerkship on Rs. 70 without undergoing the tedium of a further three-year course in a College. The introduction of the High School Final standard, therefore, in the first place postulates a higher paid class of men and the reorganisation of the staff of the department. 1 have calculated that a cadre of Inspectors of three-fifths of the total number of the present Inspectors and Veterinary Assistants combined would, provided each were supplied with a peon, cost Government only about Rs. 20,000 more than the present cadre. The diminution in numbers proposed is doubtless liable to criticism, but this would be counterbalanced by other advantages. Another of the Committee's suggestions subsequently accepted by Government provided for the division of the province into four circles each under a Superin- tendent of the Superior Service. Thus reorganisation has been effected by the creation of four circles and one sub-circle. If, therefore, the suggested new staff is placed completely under the Superintendents and the latter have power to move them to any place in their circle where disease may break out, the diminution in numbers would be offset by the greater mobility attained. The evolution of the Veterinary Depart- ment in Burma has clearly been, as the old reports show, along the following lines. When the Veterinary Assistants were first appointed they were meant to treat the individual animal and to deal with all manner of diseases. Later in 1895-96 what may be called mass tactics were adopted by the framing of the Segregation Rules under the Village Act and the energies of the department came to be directed more and more to the control of the main contagious diseases. The Veterinary Assistants, however, are still attached to townships and controlled to some extent by the Deputy Commissioners. I consider that in the future a proper division of labour would be as follows : The registration of deaths of cattle, the reporting of outbreaks and the enforcement of segregation measures, which are essentially police measures, should be in the hands of the district executive. Inoculation measures should be in the hands of the Veterinary Superintendents, each of whose staff should
FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1928. 15 be completely mobile within his circle. The Provincial Government should attempt only the control of contagious diseases. The treatment of ordinary diseases should be considered a legitimate function of the District Councils and Municipalities which should be encouraged to open dispensaries for the sale of simple drugs and antiseptics and for the treatment of common ailments of animals, the Provincial Government lending or training the staff for the purpose. I would strongly oppose any proposal to transfer the control of contagious disease to the District Councils. In the case of the two most dangerous diseases in England this experiment was tried, but was not successful and the control has had to pass back into the hands of the Ministry of Agriculture. The above, in brief, is the plan which I am referring for discussion to the experts of the department and to Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners. The alternative will be to revert to the previous scheme of vernacular instruction and a large cadre of poorly paid Veterinary Assistants with possibly for their better control a larger staff of Provincial officers. As pointed out in a previous paragraph it has been necessary to stop recruitment of students for a year until a policy has been worked out. 29. I have to express my thanks to all the members of the superior staff for their help during the year. The following members of the Provincial and Subordinate Veterinary Services have been recommended for commendation by their superior officers and I support their com- mendations : U Aung Tun U, as Veterinary Inspector, Akyab (now Deputy Superintendent) ; U San Hla, Deputy Superintendent (Assistant Principal, Veterinary School, Insein) ; U Saw Hla U, Deputy Superin- tendent, Meiktila ; U Po Kyi, Veterinary Inspector, Katha ; U Bwin Gyi, Veterinary Inspector (Assistant Instructor, Veterinary School, Insein) ; U Po Tun, Frontier Veterinary Inspector, Amherst ; U Hla Gyaw, Veterinary Inspector, Sandoway ; U Po Aung, Veterinary Inspector, Bassein ; U Aung Thein, Veterinary Assistant, Kyaikkami ; U Tha Khin, Veterinary Assistant, Kyaikmaraw ; U Ba Kyan, Veterinary Assistant, Moulmein ; U Hla Gaing, Veterinary Assistant, Chaungzon ; U Saw U, Veterinary Assistant, Sandoway ; and U Myint, Veterinary Assistant, Nyaunglebin.

CONTENTS. PAGE CHAPTER I.RESOLUTION ON THE Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Burma (INCLUDING THE INSE1N VETERINARY SCHOOL) For the Year ended the 31st March 1929. Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Burma, Agricultural Department (Ministry of Forests),From U CHIT MAUNG (2), B.A., A.T.M., Secretary to the Financial Commissioner, (Transferred Subjects), Burma, to the Secretary to the Government of Burma, Forest Department,( 2 ) 3. As regards segregation statutory rules made under the Burma Village Act (the Cattle Diseases Rules, 1914), provide for standstill orders. There are similar orders (the Diseases of Animals Towns Rules 1923) in force in Municipal towns. In this respect Burma is, the Financial Commissioner believes, in advance of any of the Indian Provinces except Madras. The Cattle Diseases Rules, 1914, were further extended during the year under report, and are now in force wherever the Burma Village Act, 1907, applies excepting part of the Salween District. The report mentions that the rules were vigorously enforced in the Katha and Bassein Districts during the year. That was due to energetic Deputy Commisioners. The rules however require revision with regard to providing more effective control over the movements of drovers' herds, and other cattle entering districts in which contagious disease has not yet broken out, and in which therefore stanstill orders under Rule 13 cannot be applied. Improvement of the rules is needed also, as is mentioned in paragraph 11 of this report, for enforcing quarantine against cattle entering Burma from neighbouring countries. The adminstration of the rules is in the hands of the Deputy Commis- sioners and their subordinates and the division of responsibility between the Veterinary Department, the Deputy Commissioners and the District Councils which was commented upon in the Financial Commissioner's review of the report for 1926-27 has not yet been altered. The draft Animal Diseases Act, intended to replace these rules as well as the Glanders and Farcy Act, 1899, mentioned in para- graph 11 of the report, and Mr. McKerral's own suggestions are still (as there stated) under consideration. The Financial Commissioner regrets that he has not yet been able to make the necessary exami- nation of these legislative provisions and to submit his proposals to Government. The Government of India now contemplates all India legislation on this subject in accordance with the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Agriculture. Special provisions not suitable for all India provinces will probably be necessary for Burma and if an all-India Act would prevent such special provisions, it would be better for Burma to be left out of the all-India legislation. 4. As regards the other method of control there has been some progress in plans for making use of the serum cum virus method (some- times called the " scrum simultaneous" method) of inoculation against rinderpest, which was mentioned in the previous year's report. The advice and the assistance given in this matter by Mr. D. T. Mitchell, M.R.C.V.S., an officer borrowed from the Government of the Union of South Africa, was mentioned in the report for that year By the opportune outbreak of rinderpest in the Pinjrapole Depôt near Rangoon, and with the enlightened co-operation of the Pinjrapole Society, the Department was able to carry out an experiment described in the report, which may prove to be of great value in assisting the
( 3 ) introduction of the " serum simultaneous " method. The Financial Commissioner thinks that the Pinjrapole Society deserves the thanks of Government and the gratitude of the public for this beneficent service. The problem of reducing the expense of this method has not been solved. It should be observed that over 1,000 cattle died of rinder- pest in the Akyab District after being inoculated against rinderpest by the serum alone method which has been in use in Burma hitherto. It is satisfactory however that, notwithstanding the brief duration (6 to 12 days) of the immunity given by the serum alone method, and the deaths that have occurred after inoculation by that method, inoculation is nevertheless reported to be not unpopular among cattle owners generally in Burma. 5. The Financial Commissioner thinks that more attention should be given to improving the reporting of contagious diseases, as well as to improving the methods for controlling them. As was pointed out in the Financial Commissioner's review of the report for 1926-27, where Mr. Blake's comments were quoted, the inaccuracy of the cattle mortality returns in Burma is remarkable. The Department during the year has made some attempt to reduce the delay in the compilation of the returns of cattle deaths recorded by village headmen. The compilation is not done by the Veterinary Department, except the com- pilation of Provincial totals, which is done in the office of the Head of the Department. The Township and District figure are compiled by Township Officers and Deputy Commissioners, and hitherto the local veterinary officers have not seen the statistics, until they are published with the annual report after the end of the year. The Circle Officers of the Veterinary Department have only one clerk each and are therefore unable at present to compile the cattle- death statistics in their own offices. By the arrangement which has now been made copies of the returns for each month should reach the Veterinary Circle Officers about three months after the month to which they relate. It was suggested in last year's review that though the statistics of mortality are highly inaccurate the statistics of death from contagious disease may be somewhat better than the aggregate figures, and graphs of rinderpest mortality by districts were prepared in the Financial Commissioner's office. Though no satisfactory conclusions could be drawn from the graphs, Mr. Dunn is still of opinion that the departmental officers should study the statistics and endeavour to secure their improvement as a means indispensable for any methodical measures to control the epizootic diseases. The monthly district returns show incredibly large variations in the number of deaths from snake bite. Careful examination of the statistics, if it does not yield satisfactory information about the routes by which infection travels and the local conditions favouring contagious diseases, may bring to notice failures in the reporting of these diseases and the
( 4 ) attention given to such failures is likely to lead to improvement in reporting. The statistics of cattle deaths and the reporting of contagious diseases would, Mr. Dunn thinks, have a better chance of being gradually improved if the monthly returns were compiled for districts in the offices of the Circle Officers of the Veterinary Department. 6. The superior staff of the Department is still below the strength which has now been fixed in the rules for the Provincial Veterinary Service, Class I. The Director of Agriculture. Mr. A. McKerral, cannot remain in charge of the Department after the 17th January 1930 the period fixed by the Secretary of State, for this arrangement. The Financial Commissioner hopes that it will be possible to secure the services of Mr. D. T. Mitchell, M.R.C.V.S., as Director of Veterinary Services. The superior staff working during the year under the Director of Agriculture were only two permanent officers of the Indian Veterinary Service, Captain J. Birkenshaw Idle, M.R.C.V.S. and Captain S. R. Rippon, M R.C.V.S., and one officiating officer. One recruit for the new Provincial Veterinary Service, Class I, Mr. J. Bhattacharjee, M.R.C.V.S., lately a State Scholar joined the Depart- ment in May 1929 after the end of the year under review. Another post of Deputy Director in the new service has still to be filled ; but that vacancy is at present supplied by U Pe Than, a Deputy Superinten- dent of the old Provincial Veterinary Service, who holds the officiating appointment above-mentioned in the Indian Veterinary Service. The two new permanent posts of Research Officers are vacant. An attempt was made in 1928 to obtain two Research Officers in temporary posts ; but Government has been advised that it is necessary to offer permanent posts. 7. Government's decision on the important proposals, which are mentioned in the report, for gradually substituting a smaller number of better educated men on higher pay for the class of Veterinary Assistants and for improving the standard of instruction at the Veterin- ary School, Insein, awaits the expected return of Mr. Mitchell from South Africa. The effect of these proposals would be to give the Veterinary Department the three classes of officers, which are to be found in many other Government services ; the third and lowest grade being analogous to Township Officers, Co-operative Myoôks, and Sub-Assistant Surgeons. In the Agricultural Department a lower class, the Junior Assistant Agriculturists, comparable to the present Veterin- ary Assistants, was tried, but was found unsuitable for work which requires some technical training and has been rejected. 8. In the development of Veterinary dispensaries, to which attention was drawn in the review of the 1926-27 report, it is disappointing to find that there is little or no progress to record. The Financial
( 5 ) Commissioner learns from the Education Ministry's review of the reports of the District Councils for 1927-28 that the Lower Chindwin District Council in that year was discussing with Mônywa Municipal Committee a proposal to establish a veterinary dispensary at Mônywa ; but he has heard no more of it. The development of dispensaries under the control of the District Councils and Municipal Committees is however a corollary of the scheme mentioned in the last paragraph for gradually substituting a better qualified and better paid class of officers for the Veterinary Assistants, and will demand further attention in due course. 9. Pending the consideration of the proposals for substituting a new class of Veterinary officers for the Veterinary Assistants, the Veterinary School has ceased to take in new recruits for the class of Veterinary Assistants. In order to make the best of the existing staff of Veterinary Assistants, however, refresher courses were held at the school. The Veterinary Assistants called in to the school at Insein for these courses were those who had been found most rusty in the subjects they had learned during their training at the school. In some cases it appears they are extraordinarily forgetful of what they have learned. The reports of the inspecting officers show that there are other defects besides ignorance among the Veterinary Assistants. The standing orders of the Department require the Veterinary Assistant to treat 60 cases a month. It is said that Veterinary Assistants make illicit gifts of Government medicines which can be used also for the purposes of human beings and that they make false returns of cases treated in order to conceal such use of Government medicines and to satisfy the standing orders requiring 60 cases to be treated each month. Some of the deficiencies of the Veterinary Assistants are no doubt due to the insufficient inspection which they have received, in the past while the Department was so much undermanned in the highest grade of officers Besides the refresher courses for the more backward Veterinary Assistant the orders of Government require that the Veterinary Assistants should be given post-graduate training in the Veterinary School before they are permitted to pass the efficiency bar at Rs. 120 in their scale of salary. The present scale of pay which is Rs. 50REPORT ON THE Civil Veterinary Department, Burma For the Year ended the 31st March 1929. CHAPTER I.2 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, the state of affairs at the time. His report and that of the Deputy Commissioner indicate that in Akyab it is extremely difficult for the segregation rules to be followed. The local custom is to let loose the cattle to graze in the jungles when they are not wanted for agricul- tural operations. Outbreaks of disease occur when the cattle are living under these semi-feral conditions and are only detected when they are collected for ploughing. The result is that all the cattle in the village- tract are potential in-contacts and it is practically impossible to segregate all in-contacts at the beginning of the ploughing season. Another difficulty is that cultivators in one village-tract frequently own land in another village-tract and it is impossible to prohibit cattle from moving unless large areas are to be left fallow. The provision of separate drinking places for in-contact cattle is also a difficulty. The Deputy Commissioner remarks : " In these circumstances I think all that can be done is to insist on strict segregation of all sick cattle and to prohibit cattle movement altogether from any infected village-tract until the animals have been inoculated and re-inoculated. I have issued orders accordingly for dealing with any outbreak this year. It will be necessary of course for the Veterinary staff to inoculate and re-inoculate promptly all cattle in the affected village-tracts. There need be no difficulty in getting cattle owners to agree to inoculation. Faced with the alternative of inoculation or penning up their cattle in pens constructed at their own expense they generally prefer the former." 3. In the Amherst district there was a recrudescence of the disease particularly in the Kawkareik township, the total number of deaths recorded for the district being 2,861 as against 1,059 in the previous 3'ear. The Deputy Commissioner notes: " The mortality would possibly have been greater had it not been for the successful inoculation of the remaining cattle. I am glad to note the good work done by the staff in this direction. Better results could have been obtained were the reports of the outbreaks received in time. As it was, the ignorant Karen owners were very slow in bringing the outbreaks to the notice of the authorities and the consequence was that preventive measures could not be taken till the infection had widely spread. " The highest monthly mortality was 735 in July 1928 and the lowest recorded was 8 for the month of November 1928. The outbreak has much abated but has not yet been completely stamped out. The total deaths for the month of March were 123. 4. In Henzada the disease was prevalent in the Lemyethna township. The Deputy Commissioner reports : " The segregation rules have been effectively enforced." The highest mortality was in the month of July 1928, the deaths for that month recorded being 239. By March 1929 the disease had practically died out there being only 16 deaths recorded in that month for the whole district.
FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1929. 3 5. In Bassein the total mortality from rinderpest was 606, being mainly in the Yegyi township. The Deputy Commissioner reports : " The Subdivisional Officers report that the rules are fairly well under- stood and observed except in rare cases. At the conferences of Village Headmen the importance of the observance of these rules was explained to the headmen. Reports of outbreaks of disease were promptly attended to by segregation and the prohibition of movement of animals from infected to non-infected areas. " I visited the scene of the outbreak in February 1929 and can confirm the above statement. I found complete stoppage of cattle movement along the main roads connecting 19 villages. The only complaint I had was from some rice millers who desired to have the restrictions removed. The mortality was greatest in the month of April 1928, the deaths for that month being 103 and for March 1929 the figure stood at 26. 6. Last year in the Katha district 8,325 deaths were recorded. The number reported during the year under report is only 19 which shows that the disease has now been brought well under control. This result is largely due to the energetic action of the late Deputy Commissioner in enforcing strict preventive measures and in obtaining the co-operation of the headmen. The present Deputy Commissioner notes " Segre- gation rules, generally, are understood by village headmen and cattle owners, and where they were ignored, drastic disciplinary action was taken and heavy punishments were inflicted on them." During the year under report it was only necessary to inoculate 1,387 head of cattle against 12,889 cattle in the previous year. 7. In the Thalôn district the disease still exists but the figures show a fall from 1,168 deaths recorded last year to 915 deaths in the year under report. The disease occurred in every township in the district and there is a good deal of evidence to show that it was brought in from Siam through the Shanywathit-to-Hlaingbwe route. The Deputy Commissioner reports : " Township Officers and the Subdivisional Officers report that Cattle Disease Rules 12 and 13 have been widely made known to all village headmen in the district and villagers under- stand the rules and appreciate the value of inoculation." The only districts from which no deaths from Rinderpest have been recorded are Kyaukpyu, Tavoy, Mergui, Kyaukse, Minbu, Thayetmyo, Mandalay, Upper Chindwin and Lower Chindwin. 8. Anthrax.4 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, Civil Veterinary Department, South-Eastern Circle, with the object of determining where the areas of infection were. The conclusion arrived at was that some villages on the outskirts of Rangoon were suspected and a set of instructions was prepared by the Special Veterinary Research Officer for circulation among the owners of horses. A bulletin on this disease has also been prepared by the Research Officer and 500 copies were printed for distribution. In addition to this the preparation of a special vaccine for the disease has occupied the attention of the Research Officer and fuller details regarding this will be found in the section of this report dealing with research. 9. Surra is not registered in Burma but 12 reports were received from the Military Police. The Myitkyina area appears to be very liable to this disease which is probably imported by mules from China. The Deputy Commissioner, Myitkyina, has applied to have the Myitkyina area brought under the operation of the Glanders and Farcy Act which includes the disease of Surra in its scope and the question of providing Practitioners under the Act is being considered. A proposal has been made that instructions in the diagnosis of the disease should be given to the Military Police Veterinary Officers at the Insein Veterinary College after which they would be competent to serve as Practitioners under the Act. The total deaths recorded from this disease were 66. CHAPTER II.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 3lST MARCH 1929. 5 11. A more difficult measure is the question of cattle importation across the frontier from foreign countries or other provinces. The province of Burma has three such frontiers, viz. (1) The Chittagong Division of Bengal in the north-west, (2) Siam in the south-east, and (3. China in the north-east. Arrangements have been in force for the last eight or nine years whereby notices of outbreaks of cattle disease in Chittagong are communicated by telegram by the Collector of Chittagong to the Deputy Commissioner of Akyab. In the case of the south-east frontier action to prevent the ingress of disease from out- side is taken in the Salween, Thatôn and Amherst districts. In the Salween district there is a quarantine station at Methalauk on the Papun- Dagwin road which the Deputy Commissioner reports has been of great advantage in preventing the importation of cattle disease from Siam. During the year 544 oxen and buffaloes from Siam came into the district. In the Thatôn district there is a Frontier Assistant at Shanywathit which is on the main road from Siam to Hlaingbwe. The Deputy Commissioner reports : " He appears to have performed the duties of checking and examining the cattle carefully. " He was not, however, able to prevent the ingress of cattle suffering from Rinderpest from Hmainlongyi and the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, when he toured in February 1929 found a herd which had come from Siam near that village in which there were 21 sick animals and 189 in-contacts. It is quite clear that the Frontier Veterinary Assistants although they may assist in the usual measures after cattle cross the border are not able to enforce quarantine nor are there any legal powers to enable them to do so. There is little doubt that disease is constantly being brought in to these frontier districts from Siam. In the case of the North-East Frontier, the Deputy Commissioner, Myitkyina, has some remarks to make on this subject. He states as follows : " An attempt was begun about two years ago to protect the district against infection from China. Two Veterinary Assistants were to be posted at Sadon and Sima to inspect animals coming along the main routes into Burma. In any case I doubt the value of the segregation officers. There are other roads that cattle can come in to avoid deten- tion. In any case they have long journeys through the hills from the last place, infection could be got and few infected animals can come in. If, as seems to be the case, Rinderpest can occur without any outside source of infection as for instance occurred in Putao last year, I think it would be better to concentrate on inoculation and give up this blocking of frontier roads. The men on the job have, so far as I know, done no useful preventive work." This opinion is to the effect that we should not prevent disease coming in from outside but allow it in and then attempt to control it by the rules under the Village Act if they are operated in that locality. In last year's report I expressed
6 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, the opinion that Rinderpest is enzootic in the province. It is probably carried over from year to year by the wild boyines of the jungles which are known to get it. At the same time as stated in last year's report there seems no reason why if we take the trouble to prevent cattle disease from passing from one district of the province to another we should not also take the trouble of preventing it from passing into the province from foreign countries. The " Animals Diseases Act " referred to in last year's report is still under consideration. Mr. D. T. Mitchell, M.R.C.V.S., Special Veterinary Research Officer, has prepared a draft which embodies his South African experience and I have made some suggestions for the amendment of the present " Cattle Disease Rules " with a view to giving more power to prevent disease coming in from outside. These matters are at present under consideration by the Financial Commissioner. CHAPTER III.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1929. 7 Commissioner has been freely allowed. Most other Deputy Commis- sioners have come to the same opinion. Thus the Deputy Commis- sioner, Mandalay, states : " It is encouraging to observe that in this district the people are showing more willingness to co-operate with the Veterinary Officers in stamping out disease. The villagers generally appreciate the value of inoculation and they readily come forward to have their cattle inoculated by the Veterinary Assistants." The Deputy Commissioner, Myaungmya, also remarks : " Outbreaks of Rinderpest were very few on the whole land the timely inoculation nipped the disease in the hud." 13. The real fact is that inoculation can only be of secondary importance to segregation. In paragraph 11 of last year's report it was pointed out that the great outbreak of Rinderpest in the British Isles which took place in the year 1865 was suppressed by "standstill" measures without any recourse being made to inoculation which was then unknown. It may be taken as being generally true that even the serum- alone method of control is quite effective provided the disease is not allowed to spread rapidly from village to village. This spread can only be prevented by the stoppage of movement as was done successfully in Bassein and Katha during the last two years. If the disease can be prevented from spreading in this way we have segregation and inocula- tion to fall back on in order to stamp it out in the individual villages. If, however, the conditions are such, as they are in Akyab, as to make the segregation and other measures difficult the disease soon assumes a degree of magnitude which makes the Veterinary staff impotent to deal with it. Every effort should, therefore, be made towards the enforcing and the strengthening of the rules under the Village Act. It is hoped to introduce the serum-simultaneous method, of which a short descrip- tion was given in paragraph 15 of last year's report, on an experimental scale during the present year and after standard doses have been worked out. 14. In addition to inoculation for Rinderpest a beginning has been made with Anthrax vaccines prepared in the laboratory of the Insein Veterinary College by the Special Veterinary Research Officer. These have been used so far only on elephants. Messrs. The Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation, Limited, permitted an experiment to be made with the vaccine on three of their animals while Messrs. MacGregor & Co., who employ their own Veterinary Officer have been given a supply of the vaccine for trial on their elephants. It is too early yet to say whether this vaccine will prove a success or not. The Research Officer proposes to make a crucial test on certain vaccinated elephants by inoculation of these with Anthrax virus and a site for this experi- ment has been selected in the Sittang Valley.
8 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA. CHAPTER IV.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1929. 9 touched on in paragraph 15 of last year's report. It was decided that the Research Officer should collect virus, work out the standard doses and then begin actual inoculation with Government-owned herds on the stations of the Agricultural Department. The attempt to collect virus and to set up the disease in cattle and goats at the Veterinary College encountered considerable difficulties. Virus was obtained from Thazi, Yamèthin and Akyab and cattle and goats were inoculated. Owing, however, either to the low degree of virulence in the strains collected or to the high degree of immunity of the experimental animals it was some time before a proper going strain was obtained. Finally, however, it was possible to begin inoculation on the cattle at Hmawbi. Here 20 full grown animals were inoculated by the serum-simultaneous method on the 26th February 1929. The animals were divided up into four batches, receiving doses of serum with two controls which received virus only. The first batch received 5 c.c. per 100 lb. weight, the second batch 7 c.c., the third 9 c.c. and the fourth 11 c.c. Of the first batch two animals gave a definite Rinderpest reaction commencing about the ninth day when the temparature exceeded 104°F. but returned to normal about the fifteenth day. One animal gave a double reaction and showed Surra on the thirteenth day and the fourth did not develop a reac- tion and was presumably immune. In the case of the second batch three of the six animals gave a definite Rinderpest reaction. One showed a double rise of temperature on the eighth day and two animals showed no reaction. Of the third batch three of the four animals showed definite Rinderpest reaction combined with clinical symptoms. The fourth gave no reaction. In the case of the fourth batch three showed definite Rinderpest reaction and returned to normal about the thirteenth day. One of these reacting animals developed an attack of Surra. Clinical symptoms (diarrhoea) occurred in the reacting animals. Of the two control animals which got virus only one developed an acute reaction and Rinderpest but recovered. The second control gave no reaction and was apparently immune. The curious thing about these figures is that the smaller doses of serum gave the best results. From these tests the Research Officer drew the following conclusions :10 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, ages and including a number of buffaloes at the Pinjrapole Society's Depôt for old cattle at Bauktaw on the outskirts of Rangoon. Seeing in this outbreak an excellent opportunity for carrying out a test of the serum-virus method of protection, the Research Officer in company with the local Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, interviewed the Society and was able to prevail upon the committee to agree to have the method carried out. It was pointed out that if the department was willing to spend approximately Rs. 600 on serum for inoculation of animals, the majority of which were apparently useless pensioners, the Society should in return give some assistance in the experimental work on this disease and if they were not prepared to do this the question of control of the disease by segregation measures would have to be con- sidered. This resulted in the necessary permission being given not only to the double inoculation of portion of the herd but also to the collec- tion of virus from sick animals. Inoculation work was commenced on the following day, viz., 8th March 1929, in the following ways, with virus derived from an animal that had died of Rinderpest and with ordinary and special serum got from Muktesar. Deaths had only been occurring among the young stock and it was decided to use the serum- virus method on this class of animal only as being most likely to give the required information. At the time the Research Officer had only 50 closes of special serum on hand but a further batch of 50 animals of the same class was inoculated with virus plus a double dose of ordinary serum. Animals showing a febrile reaction were not inoculated with virus. High percentages of temperature of over 103'5°F. were found among the young stock indicating that the disease was spreading rapidly among these animals. The remainder of the cattle and all the buffaloes were protected by serum alone. Five methods were tried as follows :FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1929. 11 showed a temperature of under 103° to 105° F. at inoculation. The inoculation took place on the 9th March. Up to 21st March 9 deaths had occurred in the batch : 7 cattle and 2 calves. A number of the animals became visibly ill and recovered. The conclusion arrived at was that inoculation with a double dose of ordinary serum plus virus cannot be recommended. The fourth batch consisting of 20 cattle which showed a temperature of 103° to 105° F. and over were given a double dose of ordinary serum without virus on 9th March. By 20th March 11 deaths had occurred : 7 cattle and 4 calves. The conclusion to be drawn is that ordinary serum given to reacting animals affected with Rinderpest in doses of 10 c.c. per hundred pounds is not sufficient to control the disease and to effect a recovery. The remaining batch consisting of 233 cattle and buffaloes of varying ages were inoculated with a normal dose of ordinary serum in the following ways :12 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, (3) The inoculation of virus plus increased doses of ordinary serum is not recommended. The special serum supplied from Muktesar which is of very high potency compared with the ordinary serum is required. 19. As soon as these tests were finished all Deputy Superintendents were called in to Insein to undergo a special course in the technique of serum-simultaneous inoculation which was given by the Research Officer. The course lasted for a week. This work has unfortunately been interrupted by the unavoidable return of Mr. Mitchell to South Africa but will be resumed as soon as he returns. Steps will be taken to provide a continuous source of virus and to put the method into practice in actual outbreaks. 20. Anthrax.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1929. 13 their animals. No further report has been received on this. Messrs. Steel Brothers & Co. have also arranged to vaccinate the animals belonging to them. Half a million doses of this vaccine are available and are ready for issue for the immunisation of cattle and for test inoculation in buffaloes under field conditions. 21. Parasitical Diseases.14 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, advaritages there are also obvious advantages to be derived from the Veterinary Research Officer working side by side with the Chemist, Botanist, Mycologist and Entomologist with whom collaboration would be easy and profitable. During the year Mr. Mitchell prepared at my request bulletins on the following subjects :FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1929. 15 Non-infectious diseases met with include the following :16 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, and of cases supplied with medicine but not brought to the hospital 611 compared with 2,544 and 320 in the previous year. The dispensary is in charge of a Veterinary Assistant. A site for the new dispensary was looked for and a new building situated at the centre of Myingyan town was occupied in consultation with the Chairman of the District Council with effect from the 1st December 1928. The new site is near the bazaar and it is hoped that the change of site will result in a larger num- ber of patients coming forward. Pakôkku. Dispensary.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1929. 17 27. During the year proposals to increase the status and pay of Veterinary Assistants and to increase the stipend of students from Rs. 25 to Rs. 40 were placed before Government. As it has not yet been possible to come to a decision in this matter no further recruitment of students has taken place and when the present class leave the school in May 1929 there will be no pupils left. The necessity for coming to an early decision is apparent. The teaching in this school has previously been in the vernacular and the school would appear to be the only one in India where this is so. The new proposals are to raise the standard of entrance to the High School Final and to have all the teaching in English. The Agricultural Committee of 1925 recommended a staff consisting of a Principal, an Assistant Principal and five Lecturers. The qualifications required of the Lecturers will depend, however, on whether the teaching is to be done in English, or, as previously, in the vernacular and until this ques- tion is decided there will be little use in recruiting the staff. An advertisement has recently appeared in the papers for three Lecturers, viz., (a) a Lecturer in Chemistry and Physics, a Lecturer in Biology and Parasitology and a Lecturer in Veterinary Anatomy and Physiology. 28. The new students' hostel was taken over in August 1928 and has been occupied by the students since that date. The health of the students was good notwithstanding the absence of facilities for recreation owing to the grounds not having yet been brought into playable condition. 29. Refresher Courses for Veterinary Assistants were started during the year. The first batch was given instruction from 1st September to 30th November 1928. This was attended by 19 Veterinary Assistants, one from the South-Western, three from the South-Eastern, seven from the Central and eight from the Northern Circle. The second Refresher Course commenced on the 15th December 1928 and ended on the 15th March 1929. This was attended by 21 Veterinary Assistants : seven from the South-Western, three from the South-Eastern, three from the Central and eight from the Northern Circle. Two of the Assistants of this batch, however, one from Henzada and the other from Bassein had to be sent back before completion of the course owing to outbreaks of Rinderpest in their charges. The courses consisted of the following :18 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, In connection with the first batch the Superintendent reports : "It was unfortunate that having to go myself on a special tour to Arakan I was unable to get back before the termination of the course, so that I could not hold an oral examination. The members of the teaching staff, however, obtained a good idea of what these Assistants did not know or had forgotten at the time the course started, and I am informed that there was a noticeable improvement in their knowledge at the end of the course." Of the 19 students out of a total of 200 marks 8 obtained more than 150, 8 more than 120 and no students had less than half the marks. In the second batch all obtained over 50 per cent. of the aggregate and more than half obtained two-thirds or more of the aggregate. The Superintendent reports : "The members of the teaching staff found a similar degree of improvement in the knowledge of the Assistants at the end of the course as was the case with the previous batch." This batch was also taken out and given instructions in the serum-simultaneous method of inoculation conducted by the Research Officer at the Bauktaw Pinjrapole Society's Cattle Depôt. Another course has since been begun and it is proposed to make these courses a permanent feature of the work of the school or at least to continue them so long as they appear to be necessary.

The total number of villages visited by them was 35,331 and the average number of days of touring was 220. A good many complaints were received during the year of the inefficiency of the Veterinary Assistants and it was found necessary to remove two from the service for various misdemeanours. An attempt has been made to improve the quality of their work by means of Refresher Courses at the Insein Veterinary School as reported in the chapter on " Veterinary Instruction." Under the present departmental instructions Veterinary Assistants are required to spend at least 20 days on tour during the month, to take with them a chest containing medicines and to treat at least 60 animals per month. In the opinion of at least one Superintendent these instructions should be revised for the reason that they are very often evaded and that it is difficult to prevent their evasion. It has been suggested that they should be required to take out the medicine chest only in cases of contagious disease like foot-and-mouth and then only by order of the Township Officer. I have not, however, considered it advisable to introduce any changes at present and until the orders of Government have been received on the reorganisation proposals. In the absence of dispensaries the present method seems to be the only one suitable for providing cultivators with assistance in case of outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease. 34.

Draft rules for the new Provincial Service, Class I, were framed during the year and have now been approved by Government. At the same time the sanction of Government has been solicited to the creation of the extra posts included in the cadre of the new service. Rules for the Burma Veterinary Service, Class II, and for the subordinate service are at present under preparation. A. McKERRAL, Officer-in-Charge, Civil Veterinary Department, Burma.

Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Burma, Agricultural Department (Ministry of Forests),( 2 ) practically every town in Burma, but now that the fact is demonstrated that disease has been imported through Rangoon, and has spread through the agency of these herds, the question assumes especial importance for this particular area. Another problem which will require early consideration is the concentration of control over Epizootic disease, at present divided among the Veterinary Department, the Civil Department and Local Authorities. Relations amongst these different controlling authorities have always been cordial, but it may be found on examination that better results could be obtained by more centralisation. The question is at present engaging the attention of the Ministry. In conclusion, His Excellency the Governor, acting with his Ministers desires to record his thanks to Mr. Mitchell and the officers of the Department for the energy and enthusiasm with which they have tackled their work in the past year. He desires also to take this opportunity to convey to Mr. McKerral his special thanks for the efficient manner in which he has, during the past four years, combined the duties of head of the Veterinary Department with those of his own appointment. The preliminary work done by Mr. McKerral during his incumbency of the post laid the foundation of the reorganisa- tion now in progress, and kept the Department alive through a difficult transition period. By order, R. M. MACDOUGALL, Secretary to the Government of Burma, Local Government Department.
Letter No. 116( 2 ) the Financial Commissioner thinks that the graphs showing the variation of the reported figures from year to year should continue to be annexed to the annual reports. 5. Generally speaking, the methods used for control of rinderpest in the year under report have been the same as in previous years. Some Deputy Commissioners complacently report that the rules for segrega- tion and control by stand-still orders are understood by the rural population and effectively carried out. Other Deputy Commissioners admit that the rules are not understood or effectively enforced. The fluctuation of the line in the graphs which shows the mortality figures while the Deputy Commissioners have been repeating these reports from year to year and the Department has continued to use the same methods of preventive inoculation show that there is little ground for claims that the reduction of the mortality in 1929-30 was the result of enforcement of the Cattle Disease Rules or of preventive inoculation by the Department. The Director's explanation of the abatement of rinderpest in 1929-30 will be found in Section X of the Report. The high mortality of recent years appears to have been concentrated in certain areas, particularly in the Akyab District. The Director mentions on page 32 of the report the risk of severe loss in the Lower Chindwin District owing to the loss of natural immunity in areas which have not been visited by rinderpest for several years. As has been pointed out before it is necessary for the Department to be prepared to encounter a severe and widespread outbreak of this disease in the dry zone districts similar to the severe outbreak of 1906-07 in those parts. The Department in recent years has not been sufficiently strong in its. superior staff to make any notable progress in preparing for more effective action. 6. The overlapping responsibility for the control of contagious diseases shared by the District Councils, the District Revenue Officers and the Veterinary Department continues. A proposal has been sub- mitted to Government for relieving the District Councils from respon- sibility in respect of contagious diseases. The matter is still under discussion. 7. Some progress has evidently been made towards the introduction of the serum-cum-virus inoculation against rinderpest. This method gives an estimated period of three years' immunity to the inoculated animals instead of six to twelve days' immunity which is given by the system of inoculation by serum alone which has hitherto been practised in Burma. It is of good promise for the introduction of the serum- cum-virus method that inoculation is reported to be not unpopular among rural owners of cattle. Expense still remains a drawback to this improvement method of preventive inoculation. It was estimated in the review of the 1927-28 report to cost about Rs. 1-14-0 per head on account of the serum and virus used without other expenses.
( 3 ) 8. No progress can yet be recorded in providing legal powers for enforcing quarantine upon herds of cattle on droving routes for which powers do not exist at present unless the route passes through village tracts in which cattle disease is present. Proposals for the amendment of the law in this respect has been suspended in order to await the production of the all-India legislation which has been proposed by the Indian Agricultural Research Council. Quarantine on the land frontiers and against cattle coming from Indian Provinces by land or sea also await the production of the Indian proposals. 9. The recruitment of the subordinate staff of the Department has now been for several years at a stand-still, the last batch of recruits were admitted to the Veterinary School in 1926 and completed their training in 1929. The proposals which, after consultation of Commis- sioners of Divisions, were submitted to Government in 1929 to substitute gradually a class of Veterinary Assistants, who will have sufficient knowledge of English to study text-books, and who will be analogous to the subordinate services of the Agricultural, Medical and other Services, are still under discussion. Meanwhile the Veterinary College teaching staff has therefore not been fully recruited and the College is being used only for refresher classes for the old type of subordinates. Post graduate courses, which are prescribed for these men as a qualification for the highest rates in their scale of pay, have not yet been held. A modification of the proposals by the addition of a a new class of lower subordinates corresponding to fieldmen in the Agricultural Department is likely to cause some further delay for con- sultation of the local officers. 10. The Director has been giving attention to the improvement of cattle mortality returns and of the arrangements for reporting out- breaks of contagious disease. The rules under the Burma Village Act, 1907, for recording deaths of cattle were extended to several areas which had formerly been left out of the operation of the rules. But there are still some tracts in the plains of Burma to which these rules are not extended. The proposal to transfer the compilation of the mortality returns from the Deputy Commissioners' offices to the offices of the Veterinary Circle Officers, as the Director says, could not be carried out for want of clerical staff in the offices of the Deputy Directors. The Financial Commissioner thinks that not much improve- ment of the returns can be hoped for as long as they continue to be compiled in the Deputy Commissioners' offices and that the transfer of this duty to the Veterinary Circle Officers should be carried out as soon as Government can afford the necessary staff. 11. The Deputy Directors have only one clerk in their offices and it is the practice to employ Veterinary Assistants in these offices in order that they may be kept open while the Deputy Directors are on tour
( 4 ) and in order to assist the single clerk when the Deputy Director is at headquarters. The Veterinary Assistants have a higher scale of pay than District office clerks and the employment of men with technical training for clerical posts is regrettable. But the Financial Commissioner has come to the conclusion that the practice must continue until the Pro- vincial finances are sufficiently restored to enable the clerical staffs to be increased and has reported accordingly to Government. 12. There is no progress to report in the development of Veterinary Dispensaries. The Burmese public, with the exception of a few benevolent individuals, take little interest in them; and the District Councils, which are responsible for maintaining them, desire to abolish the existing Veterinary Dispensaries and have been disputing with the Municipal Committees, in whose territories these dispensaries are situated, about the responsibility for the cost of maintenance. It is pro- bable that all the four existing dispensaries will shorlty be abolished. The treatment which can be given in a brief visit by Veterinary Assist- ants on tour is not considered to be satisfactory, and Mr. Dunn thinks that the abolition of the four dispensaries experimentally established in Pegu, Prome, Pakokku and Myingyan Municipalities should not be the end of attempts to make improved provision for veterinary services other than control of contagious diseases and that some form of small dispensaries should be tried in more favourable circumstances.

The necessity for a Hindustani-speaking staff of Veterinary Assistants and pamphlets on disease in this language is emphasised by the Deputy Commissioner. Foot-and-Mouth Disease occurred in Insein and Hlegu and caused the deaths of 9 cattle. Anthrax caused the deaths of 38 animals in Insein, Hlegu and Taikkyi townships. The outbreak in the Mingaladon area occurred simultaneously with the outbreak of rinderpest and there was difficulty in differential diagnosis. Very few of the deaths recorded could be confirmed microscopically on account of the absence of blood smears. Large numbers of cattle and buffaloes are kept in the area between Rangoon and Mingaladon under primitive conditions and the animals depend on free grazing for their existence. The owners in many cases have no fixed abode and the Cattle Disease Rules are a dead letter to them. Responsibility is difficult to fix and segregation is almost impos- sible on account of the restricted grazing areas available. Under these conditions control of disease becomes a problem which could only be solved by a large staff capable of exercising constant and efficient supervision. The area, being in the neighbourhood of the Rangoon Municipal area and traversed by main roads which are used by large numbers of cattle coming in from the collecting centre at Prome to Rangoon for slaughter, and sale, is a very important one and special measures for the control of contagious disease, are under consideration.

The system of registration of cattle deaths was introduced into the district a year ago. (2) SHWEBO SUB-CIRCLE. SHWEBO DISTRICTFOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1930. 17 Surra occurred in all townships in the district and resulted in a mortality of 103 head in eleven outbreaks. The rules for the registration of cattle deaths are not applied in this district and the recorded mortality is merely an estimate of cattle deaths. Segregation measures were successfully applied to prevent spread into other districts. MYITKYINA DISTRICT18 REPORT ON THE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, In the Katha and Myitkyina outbreaks considerable trouble was encountered in controlling the disease as many of the infected herds belonged to Indians who would not carry out the Cattle Disease Rules regarding reporting of disease and segregation measures. The inocula- tion measures were resented. Foot-and-Mouth Disease.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1930. 19 confirmation by microscopical examination of smears these figures must be accepted with some suspicion but the position requires urgent investigation which will be arranged for as soon as possible. Segregation rules do not appear to be widely understood in this district and segregation is difficult to carry out. The Deputy Com- missioner reports that the position in this respect is slowly improving. KYAUKPYU DISTRICT20 REPORT ON THE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, Seventeen thousand four hundred and ninety-seven cattle were inoculated with anti-rinderpest serum which in consequence of the results in the recent epidemic has become very popular with the cattle owners. Segregation rules are not well understood and are difficult to enforce owing" to (1) the individual ownership of land in different villages and the resulting interference with farming operations, (2) the practice of common grazing grounds for stock with inefficient cattle herds. The position is slowly improving and rewards have been made to headmen for their assistance in carrying out the Cattle Disease Rules with promising results. Foot-and-Mouth Disease was endemic throughout two townships in the district and resulted in a total mortality of 154 head. Anthrax.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1930. 21 Thus the incidence of Foot-and-Mouth disease appears to be less than that of Rinderpest or Anthrax in the returns on account of the low death rate although it is actually the disease which has the highest incidence in the Province. This inaccuracy of diagnosis which cannot be corrected until the Veterinary education of the village headman is on a higher level than at present, contributes very considerably to the factor of error in the records. The recording of mortality by means of death registers maintained by the village headmen is not practised throughout the entire Province and the returns from some of the districts in Northern Burma are approximate estimates only. Rinderpest assumed epidemic proportions during the year in Akyab, Amherst, Thatôn, Bassein, Insein, Meiktila, Myingyan, Pakôkku, Yamèthin, Katha, Bhamo and Myitkyina. The disease was widely distributed throughout the Province and outbreaks occurred in 26 out of 36 districts. The total mortality recorded was 6,472. This represents a very considerable decrease from the previous year's recorded deaths of 22,061 and indicates that control measures were applied with a fair degree of success and also that cattle in the Province during 1929-30 possessed a very high degree of natural immunity. Foot-and-Mouth Disease.22 REPORT ON THE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, bracket them in the mortality returns. This procedure must be continued until microscopic diagnosis by examination of blood smears made from the carcases can be introduced as a routine procedure. Surra.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1930. 23 Double inoculation. (serum-virus method) was used for the immunisa- tion of six selected bulls for breeding purposes at Akyab. The inoculations were done at Insein. The dose estimated the previous year was given and the results were successful. Anthrax.24 REPORT ON THE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, difficulties which are encountered in carrying out these duties and the lack of power which is vested in the officers stationed at the frontier post the work, judging by results, was carried out very efficiently. The existing Cattle Disease Rules which were mainly devised tor the control of Rinderpest require to be extended in order to cover all the epidemic diseases which are present in Burma, but it is recognised that Cattle Disease Rules without the machinery for applying them would not bring about an increased measure of success in the control or prevention of contagious disease. The introduction of cattle disease from India which was reported during the year indicates the necessity which exists for examination of all animals which arrive at the ports by a Government Veterinary Officer. At present the only restrictions which are capable of being applied are contained in Agricultural Department Notification No. 3, dated the 10th February 1922, and refer only to ruminants and swine. Other animals from any port (with the exception of British ports) are allowed to land and to be delivered to the consignee without Veterinary examination or quarantine. In this respect Burma occupies an exceptional position among the countries of the world but which from a State Veterinary point of view is fraught with grave risk. The "Diseases of Animals Act" referred to in last year's report which was contemplated for Burma to replace or augment the existing rules will, it is understood, be considered by a Veterinary Committee to be appointed this year by the Imperial Research Council for the purpose of drafting an All India Act for the control of animal diseases. Deputy Commissioners and Veterinary Officers refer on many occasions on the difficulty in securing an available site for a segregation area in many villages and to the scarcity in Lower Burma of available ground near the villages for cattle grazing. The despatch of cattle to common grazing grounds at some distance under the supervision of inefficient herds is an important factor in the spread of contagious disease and it is proposed to investigate this problem of village grazing grounds when a sufficient staff is available. SECTION V.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1930. 25 The main function of the Inspector is to inspect and check the work of the Veterinary Assistants under his control. In addition to this he has to take charge of inoculation parties in cases of outbreaks of diseases and supervise and direct the work of the Assistants who are placed under him on inoculation duty. Treatment of animals does not form a part of his routine duties and this accounts for the small number of cases treated by Inspectors during the year. (b) Mortality Returns.26 REPORT ON THE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, Council in April 1929. During the latter part of the past year diffi- culties have arisen in connection with payment of the maintenance charges for this dispensary, the Municipality being of the opinion that its existence and expense were not justified. The dispensary remained open in charge of a Veterinary Assistant to the end of the year. Negotiations in regard to its future are still in progress. Veterinary Dispensary, Myingyan.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1930. 27 At the commencement of the year there were thirteen students on the roll, all in Class 'C.' The final year examination was held towards the end of May 1929. Eleven students passed the examination and arrange- ments were made to re-examine the two students who failed to secure a pass at the first test. The second test was held in July at which both were successful. The passed students numbering thirteen in all have been given appointments in the department. Three Refresher Courses for the Veterinary Assistants were held during the year. The first course extended over a period from 22nd April to 31st July 1929 and was attended by eighteen Veterinary Assistants. The second course extended from 15th August to the 30th November 1929 and was attended by fourteen Veterinary Assistants. The third course commenced on the 2nd January 1930 and ended on the 2nd April 1930, eighteen assistants attended the course. Both oral and written examinations were held at the conclusion of each course. (b) INSTRUCTION IN VILLAGES BY FIELD STAFF. The Veterinary Superintendents, Inspectors, and Veterinary Assis- tants continued to deliver lectures and hold demonstrations on Veterinary matters as usual in the villages. Under instructions from the Director of Agriculture and Officer-in- charge of the Civil Veterinary Department, Veterinary Superintendents inaugurated a system of lectures at pagoda festivals. The results were far from encouraging and it is considered these Veterinary lectures should for some time to come be confined to the Agricultural and Co-operative Conferences. The Veterinary Superintendent, Meiktila, delivered a course of lectures and gave demonstrations to the students of Government Agricultural Farm, Mahlaing. (c) GENERAL.

The Research Laboratory was under the direction of the following officers during the year for the periods indicated:FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1930. 29 Nematodes30 REPORT ON THE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, It was decided to issue the vaccine for general inoculation of elephants in the areas where anthrax occurs annually and a series of demonstrations were arranged during March to instruct members of the firms concerned in the technique of the inoculation procedure. The arrangements were expedited in order to allow of vaccination being carried out in the rest period during the hot weather. Two thousand eight hundred and ten doses of vaccine were issued for elephants up to the end of March. An experimental batch of twelve buffaloes in the Pyinmana area and 60 cattle at the Agricultural College Farm, Mandalay, were inoculated under jungle conditions and gave satisfactory results. The details of these tests are in the course of publication as an interim report in a Departmental Bulletin. Remarks.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1930. 31 Clerical Staff.32 REPORT ON THE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, through the herds. While this naturally acquired immunity lasts, the risk of a recrudesence is decreased for some years, but in the absence of active infection this immunity is slowly lost rendering the animals (with the calves born in the interval) again susceptible. This was the position which was present at the end of the year in the Lower Chindwin area where no Rinderpest is reported to have occurred for approximately eight years. So long as movements of cattle into or out of an infected area cannot be prevented effectively; such outbreaks are bound to recur and the disease will spread rapidly in the early stages of the epidemic. Until, therefore, regulations for the control of such movements of animals are available and can be put into operation with the assurance that they will be carried out efficiently, the task of eradication of Rinderpest from the Province as a whole cannot be contemplated. Even the elimination of the disease from local centres under present conditions is not unattended with disadvantages. Unless the animals in the area are protected by natural and artificial barriers limiting movements of animals from the outside, the task is an impractical one as virulent out breaks are certain to recur at three or four yearly intervals. Nature at present balances immunity against infection and with the intro- duction of the serum-virus method of immunisation in actual outbreaks of the disease nature will be assisted to build up a strong natural immu- nity which will persist and be effective in reducing annual mortality from the disease. Complete eradication to be successful requires to be associated with efficient segregation in its widest sense. Scrum-Virus Inoculation for Rinderpest.FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1930. 33 only 45 smears from cases were confirmed at the Research Laboratory. This has been explained by the fact that the Veterinary Assistants seldom see the animals which die but an effort must be made in future to procure material for confirmation of diagnosis and the staff has been instructed accordingly. The relation of the total smears sent for diagnosis by the Veterinary Assistants to the totals sent by timber firms and Military Police during the year has already been commented upon in this report. Anthrax can be protected against by annual inoculations of a vaccine and a supply of this, tested against Burmese strains of the organism, has been prepared at Insein and used on cattle and buffaloes with successful and safe results. The Veterinary staff have been circularised regarding this vaccination and instructions for use on these animals have been furnished by the department. The use of this vaccine in any outbreaks reported will be encouraged during the coming year. Surra.34 REPORT ON THE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, FOR THE YEAR ENDED THE 31ST MARCH 1930. Arrangements are now in progress for speeding up the despatch of outbreak reports to the Central Office so that the Director of Veterinary Services will be in constant touch with current developments in con- nection with contagious disease throughout the Province and be in a position to organise additional assistance where this may be required in dealing with dangerous outbreaks. 2.

The classification of the diseases treated at the Veterinary Hospital at Insein is as follows:FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1931. 5 Pakôkku Veterinary Dispensary.6 REPORT ON THE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA. It has been found difficult to diagnose this disease definitely as Assistants will not learn to take smears from the affected part of the body. A smear from the ear is easier to make but is useless for diagnosis. The total mortality for the year was 84, the most severe outbreak occur- ring in Victoria Point Subdivision, which resulted in 65 deaths. In this outbreak protective inoculation was carried out with vaccine procured from the Imperial Veterinary Laboratory, Muktesar. Control Measures.FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1931. 7 Some of the headmen are still ignorant or imperfectly understand the Cattle Disease Rules and refusals to have cattle inoculated are common in this circle. CONTAGIOUS DISEASE IN THE CENTRAL CIRCLE. Rinderpest.8 REPORT ON THE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, Foot-and-Mouth Disease was recorded throughout all the districts in the circle and occurred in a mild form causing a small mortality. The total deaths resulting from the disease were 17. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia was of comparatively rare occurrence in this circle during the year. Sixteen deaths occurred in three districts. Anthrax occurred in the following districts:FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1931. 9 Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.10 REPORT ON THE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, Laboratory, India. The results were good but it was not possible to maintain continuous supervision and no comments can be made on the protection afforded. Arrangements are being made with a view to introducing this pre- ventive inoculation for the disease during the coming year as outbreaks in the coastal districts and riverine areas appear to be on the increase.

Both control buffaloes died of acute rinderpest on the 9th and 10th day. No deaths occurred in the serum treated animals. It is evident from these results that a dose of 12FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1931. 15 remaining 22 animals are accepted as having died as a result of vaccination or infection picked up before immunity was established, i.e., approximately 1.8 per cent. In considering the factors to which the severe reactions and mortality may have been due, the following were accepted as being the predisposing causes:16 REPORT ON THE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, The factors concerned in the production of swellings in 1930 were eliminated as far as possible and Calcium Lactate in doses of 2 ounces daily was administered to a proportion of the inoculated animals before and during the reaction. Some of the groups of elephants had not been immunised during the previous year. No ill effects were noted in these animals and the local swellings except in rare cases did not exceed a few inches in diameter. The effect of dosing with Calcium Lactate was not sufficiently striking to warrant its general use but there was evidence to show that it exercised some effect in controlling serous effusions and local swellings at the site of the inoculation. These results were considered to be sufficiently good to warrant the introduction on a wider scale during the ensuing year and arrangements are being made accordingly. Anthrax Vaccination in Cattle and Buffaloes.FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1931. 17 an average decrease in mortality on last year's figures from rinderpest of over 50 per cent. In this circle an increase of mortality from 690 to 2,804 is recorded in the year under report. The South-Eastern and South-Western Circles up to the end of 1929 were combined in one charge under a Deputy Director with headquarters at Insein. It was recognised that the area to be controlled was very much too large and as rinderpest was becoming increasingly prevalent in the South- western Circle the two circles were separated and an experienced officer placed in charge of each. The Department must at present accept the presence of rinderpest infection throughout Burma as an essential safeguard against the occurrence of an epizootic and the activities of the Department are at present limited to controlling undue mortality by isolation, segregation and inoculation of sick and incontact animals in individual outbreaks. A misconception to which references have been made on many occasions in recent reports of this Department is the eradication of rinderpest from South Africa by the serum-virus method. Protection by glycerinated bile, serum or serum-virus against the disease were only contributory factors, the principal one being that the Veterinary authorities had to deal with a progressive, law-abiding European community who in the early stages of a devastating epizootic quickly realised the necessity for Veterinary assistance. Native cattle owners were willing to do as they were told without question as they were confident that the Veterinary authorities were endeavouring to help them. A further remark is made in the 1928-29 report of the Officer-in-charge, Civil Veterinary Department, which might, if it was allowed to pass unquestioned, be responsible for further misconceptions and is now also corrected. The Officer-in-Charge accepts under Chapter II, Segregation Rules, Report of 1928-29, that rinderpest arose spontaneously in the Putao District and advocates that measures for the control of border movements shall be discontinued. This concep- tion is scientifically incorrect. The virus of rinderpest requires a constant supply of susceptible animals in order to maintain its life which, outside the body of an animal, is a very short one and effective standstill measures in outbreaks with general control of cattle move- ments within and into the province would result in the elimination of the disease in a comparatively short period. Complete eradication of rinderpest, if this was possible in Burma, would be dangerous in the absence of powers, and the necessary machinery for enforcing them, for stopping cattle movements where necessary into or within any part of the Province. It is to be hoped that this will not be demonstrated in Arakan in a few years' time owing to reintroduction of infection by illicit movements of diseased animals through any point of the border from Bassein, Henzada or Minbu.
18 REPORT ON THE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, As will be noted from the maps in the appendices rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease are widely distributed throughout the Province, but on comparison with the map in 1929-30 report it will be seen that in rinderpest the areas affected show a considerable reduction in extent even in the case of the South-Western Circle. The distribution of this disease indicates that main roads, rail and river are the main avenues of spread. Foot-and-Mouth Disease continues to be a menace to the stock throughout the Province and until more effective control of movements of animals can be enforced this disease will show little annual variation in incidence. The mortality from Anthrax, Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and Blackquarter during the year shows a slight decrease over last year's figures but a heavy annual mortality will continue to be recorded until cattle owners appreciate the value of annual preventive inoculations. Surra was recorded only from the Northern and Central Districts, but as this disease is present in a chronic form in blood of cattle through- out the Province, and cases in villagers' ponies are seldom recorded, the figures are of no value to indicate the incidence of the disease in the various districts. The figures for the year show a considerable drop in mortality. (B) NON-CONTAGIOUS DISEASES.FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1931. 19 The educational value of peripatetic veterinary duties in the villages carried out by Veterinary Assistants for which these officers have not had the requisite basic training has been disappointing, and in the absence of the essential stimulus of frequent and strict supervision a large proportion have reached such a low degree of efficiency that refresher courses have become a permanent necessity. The circle officers who have during this year, only, been brought up to full strength, have been responsible for the supervision of approximately 1½ million cattle and buffaloes each20 REPORT ON THE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, Promptness in reporting outbreaks by the headman concerned and early inoculation of the contacts by the Veterinary Staff before the disease has assumed epizootic proportions will result in considerable saving in the expenditure on serum. This has been emphasised to the staff but there are many difficulties in giving effect to the principle. Developments in the Department during the yearFOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1931. 21 As a result, the head office in Rangoon is now able to keep in touch with current developments in the districts and is able to exercise direction which was not possible previously. The Department is now only settling down to co-ordinated duties and the stage where each circle officer organised his charge as a separate unit is ceasing to exist. Additional clerical staff for circle officers is an essential to further development. At present the records of service of the subordinate staff, the payment of their salary and other bills, questions in connec- tion with leave, pension, etc., etc., are dealt with in the office of the Deputy Commissioner and the system has been found to have many drawbacks.
