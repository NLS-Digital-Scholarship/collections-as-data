REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION. 1893-94. CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTORY. Appointment of the Commission: its object. 1. The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission was appointed under the orders of His Excellency the Governor-General in Council contained in the Resolution of the Government of India, Finance and Commerce Department, No. 2792-Ex., dated 3rd July 1893. In a despatch No. 36 (Revenue), dated 16th March 1893, Her Majesty's Secretary of State informed the Government of India that in answer to a question* put in the House of Commons he had express- ed his willingness to request the Government of India to appoint a Commission to inquire into the cultivation of the hemp plant in Bengal, the preparation of drugs from it, the trade in those drugs, the effect of their consumption upon the social and moral condition of the people, and the desir- ability of prohibiting the growth of the plant and the sale of ganja and allied drugs. In requesting the Government of India to appoint a Commission for the purposes stated, the Secretary of State desired that such instructions might be issued as would ensure that the inquiry should be thorough and complete. Lord Kimberley was of opinion that the inquiry could hardly be confined to Ben- gal, but should extend to the whole of India, and that the Commission should ascertain to what extent the existence of the hemp plant all over India affects the practical difficulty of checking or stopping the consumption of ganja as dis- tinguished from other narcotic drugs prepared from the hemp plant, and whether there is ground for the statement that bhang is less injurious than ganja to con- sumers. Constitution of the Commission. 2. The Commission appointed by the Government of India Resolution of 3rd July 1893 consisted of a President and six Mem- bers, three of whom were officials and three Native non-official gentlemen. Under subsequent orders, a Secretary to the Commis- sion was appointed.2 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. I. Instructions to the CommissionCH. I.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 3 employed for taxing the drug or the cultivation of the plant should be reviewed with special reference to the comparative incidence of this taxation in differ- ent parts of India and to the comparative efficacy of the taxation imposed in restricting consumption, whether by the mere weight of the tax or by the method and stage of imposition. It is known that the rates vary considerably in different provinces, but the precise effect of the variations is not fully understood. In this connection the Commissioners should notice any case in which the proxi- mity of a Native State affects the production or consumption of the drug in British territory. (d) Political discontent, social or religious usage, and other stimu- lants or narcotics. "There are two points connected with the subject-matter of the inquiry which call for special investigation. The first of these is the danger lest prohibition, or restrictive measures of a stringent character, may give rise to serious discontent, and be resented by the people as an unjustifiable interference with long-established social customs. In some parts of India the use of hemp drugs is, it is believed, common among fakirs and ascetics held in veneration by large classes of the population. In Bengal it has been stated that an infusion of the leaves of the plant is commonly offered to every guest and member of the family on the last day of the Durga Puja: it has no ill effects, and its use is not considered reprehensible in any way. The Governor-General in Council desires that the Commissioners will endeavour to ascertain to what extent these and similar customs prevail in Bengal and other parts of India, and how far the use of hemp drugs forms a part of social, or possibly religious, ceremonial or observance, and they should, if possible, take the evidence of witnesses drawn from the classes among whom the use of hemp drugs is chiefly prevalent. The Commissioners should state their opinion whether the prohibition of the use of hemp drugs or any restrictive measures which they may deem practicable would be likely to give rise to political discontent in any parts of India or among any classes of the population. It is believed that in some parts of the country bhang is, in a special degree, the poor man's narcotic, and the possible unpopularity of a measure which would deprive the very poorest of the population of the use of a narcotic to which they have always been accustomed should not be overlooked. "Another point to which the attention of the Commissioners should be directed is the probability or possibility that, if the use of hemp drugs is prohi- bited, those who would otherwise continue to use them may be driven to have recourse to alcohol, or to other stimulants or narcotics which may be more dele- terious. (e) Recommendations of the Commission. "Finally, the Governor-General in Council requests that the Commis- sioners, if they should be of opinion that the pro- hibition of the consumption of any hemp drug should not, or could not, be enforced, will indicate, for the consideration of the Gov- ernment of India, any reforms and improvements which their investigations may lead them to recommend in the existing arrangements of each province for controlling the cultivation of the hemp plant, and the manufacture, sale, and taxation of hemp drugs. In framing their recommendations, regard should, of course, be had to the considerations which have been stated in paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Resolution. Absolute prohibition, or repressive measures of a stringent nature, may involve inquisitorial proceedings of an unpopular character, and
4 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. I. afford opportunities for the levy of blackmail; and in framing regulations for the prohibition or for the restriction of the use of hemp drugs, these considerations should be borne in mind. "If the Commission should be of opinion that the cultivation of the hemp plant for the production of drugs, or the consumption of any hemp drug, should be absolutely prohibited, it will be their duty to state the regulations which should be adopted for this purpose." Commission's method of inquiry. 4. Under the terms of the Resolution appointing the Commission, they were directed to assemble in Calcutta on the 1st August 1893. The first collective meeting of the Com- mission actually took place on the 3rd August 1893. A series of questions was drawn up by the Commission for distribution to witnesses. The series of ques- tions was prefaced by an explanatory note, in which it was carefully pointed out that they were not to be regarded as exhaustive, but were intended rather to serve as an index to the witnesses as to the subjects to which their attention should be specially directed. The witnesses were requested not to withhold any information merely because it was not indicated by any of the questions. They were invited to give any information which did not appear to fall under any of the questions, either by appending it as a separate note to the chapter under which it seemed naturally to fall, or by recording it at the end of the evidence. At the same time, as the questions were necessarily of wide and general application, it was pointed out that it was not intended that in every case the witness should answer all of them, but should confine himself to those questions which dealt with parts of the subject with which he was more or less acquainted; and, to enable the Com- mission to estimate the value of the information given, it was requested that the witness should indicate the source of his information and the facts or experi- ences on which he based his opinions and statements. Invitation to persons interested to lay their views before the Com- mission. 5. Previous to issuing their series of questions to Local Governments and Administrations for distribution to witnesses, the Com- mission had intimated to them that they were anxious to receive evidence from well-informed persons and representative associa- tions, whether philanthropic, religious, or social bodies, who desired to see the pre- paration and sale of ganja and other hemp drugs further restricted or entirely prohibited, and that it was necessary to give such persons and associations the freest opportunity of coming forward and laying their views before the Commission. To enable these persons and associations to place themselves in communication with the Commission, Local Governments and Administrations were requested to make it widely known through the Press, or in such other manner as might be suitable, that the Commission would be glad to receive written statements of their views, accompanied by an intimation as to whether the writer, or, in the case of an asso- ciation or public body, a representative, would be willing to appear before the Commission for oral examination. The Commission themselves also addressed direct a number of associations and persons who were likely to be interested in the inquiry, and further communicated to the Press through Local Governments and Administrations a letter setting forth the wishes of the Commission in respect to such persons, and intimating, for the information of the public, their proposed movements and the method of their inquiry.
CH. I.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 5 Selection of witnesses by Local Governments. 6. In circulating their questions to Local Governments and Administra- tions for distribution to suitable witnesses, the Commission took pains to explain that they attached much importance to a due proportion of non-official witnesses being selected, and requested that in the first place copies of the questions should be supplied to the persons or associations advocating restriction who might have availed them- selves of the invitation to come forward and lay their views before the Commis- sion. Should such persons or associations have held direct communication with the Commission, steps were taken by the Commission themselves to supply them with copies of the questions. In addition to this class of witnesses, Local Governments and Administrations were asked to place copies of the questions in the hands of official and non-official persons, European and Native, who either had special knowledge of the subject, or special facilities and aptitude for acquiring such knowledge. The classes of persons whose evidence the Commis- sion desired to receive included revenue officers of experience, magisterial offi- cers, police officers, medical officers, officers acquainted with special races of the people, zamindars, employers of labour, and the lower grades of officials, profes- sional men, and missionaries of all denominations. Regarding the latter class, every effort was put forth by the Commission to obtain missionary opinion on the subject of their inquiries, and it is a matter of some regret to them that their efforts have met with but little success. Not only was it announced through Local Governments that the Commission desired to receive communications from religious bodies of all denominations, but the Commission themselves also com- municated freely with persons of this class. But the large majority of them declined to come forward as witnesses, and many, including Churchmen, Dissent- ers, and Roman Catholics, communicated letters either to Government or direct to the Commission excusing themselves on the ground of want of knowledge. As an example of the want of knowledge of the subject or lack of interest in the inquiry evinced by missionaries, it may be observed that in one instance (in the Madras Presidency) the Commission made over 70 copies of their questions to two sects of missionaries professing to represent one-fifth of the whole missionary enterprise of the Madras Presidency. Yet the total number of missionaries in this Presidency who sent in answers or statements to the Commission (though some of them quoted the opinions of others) was only 15, many of whom do not belong to either of the two sects referred to. Special instructions were issued regarding two classes of witnesses. Firstly, in order to secure compliance with the orders of the Government of India that the evidence of medical experts should be freely obtained, it was requested that the questions should be distributed to selected medical officers, both European and Native. Emphasis was laid upon the importance of ascertaining the views of subordinate native medical officers whose duties bring them into contact with the people, and it was suggested that replies should either be obtained separately from com- petent officers of this class, or that they should be embodied in the replies received from Civil Surgeons. The evidence of private native medical practitioners of repute, especially of those practising after native methods, was also solicited. For the convenience of the medical experts, a separate compilation of the questions dealing only with that part of the subject with which this class of witness would be likely to be acquainted was made, the witnesses being left the option of dealing either with this abbreviated compilation or with the whole series of general ques- 2
6 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. I. tions as they saw fit. Secondly, attention was drawn to those questions which deal with the connection, causal or otherwise, of hemp drugs with crime with a view to the evidence of selected Magistrates and Police officers being obtained on this subject. Information from official and other sources. 7. In addition to the evidence of witnesses, the Commission availed themselves freely of all information regarding the subject of their inquiry already existing in official reports and documents as well as in publications of a non-official character. Local Governments and Administrations were invited to furnish complete lists of such official reports and publications, printed copies of those of special importance being submitted. In addition to these, the Commissioner of Excise or Abkari of each province was asked to present a memorandum setting forth in detail the system of administration at present in force in respect to hemp drugs, accompanied by statistics, where available, for the last twenty years in a form drawn up by the Commission. These memoranda and statistics will be found in Vol. III Appendices. Information existing in non-official publications came to the notice of the Commission from many sources, and was utilized when trustworthy or found to be of value. Preliminary tour: Objects and reasons ofCH. I.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 7 than was at first anticipated. During this tour this Commission as a whole, or in some cases Sub-Committees of the Commission, visited the head- quarters of some of the more important Native States to make arrangements for the collection of information in these States as desired by the Government of India. Opportunity was also taken by the Commission at this period of their inquiries to get at facts and opinions in an informal way; and with this object in view many visits were made by the Commission, or by members of the Com- mission (generally unexpectedly and under the guidance of private persons as well as of officials), to see cultivation and manufacture of hemp drugs, to ware- houses and to shops where these drugs are stored and sold, and to religious places and other places of resort where the drugs are consumed in some form or other. The results of these inquiries were sometimes recorded in notes, and some- times in the statements of persons who were then added to the list of witnesses. Inquiries were also held at many asylums, as will be explained in the following paragraph, which deals with the special inquiries made by the Commission in this direction. Lunatic Asylums. 9. The Commission were especially enjoined to thoroughly examine the testi- mony in support of the commonly received opinion that the use of hemp drugs is a frequent cause of lunacy, and with this object have made very searching inquiries. In order to make this very important branch of their labours as complete and searching as possible, the procedure adopted in the different asylums of India in classifying and dealing with cases of insanity ascribed to the use of hemp drugs was specially examined, and the connection, whether causal or otherwise, between hemp drugs and insanity was investigated in minute detail. Every asylum in British India was visited either by the Commission or by some members of the Commis- sion, and careful inquiries were conducted on the spot in every case of insanity attributed to the use of hemp drugs for a given period. The period selected for the whole of India was the calendar year 1892, the last year for which statistics were available at the commencement of the Commission's labours. Every case of insanity ascribed to hemp drugs in the asylums of India during the year 1892 has been specially inquired into in the asylum where the patient was confined, the papers and records of the case have been thoroughly examined, and instructions were issued to have a further local inquiry made by an ex- perienced Magistrate, in consultation with the Civil Surgeon, to ascertain the past personal and family history of the patient and any circumstances likely to throw light on the cause of his insanity. The record of this inquiry, where made, has been submitted to the Commission through the Superintendent of the asylum concerned, who has thus had an opportunity of reconsidering the case with fuller information before him on which to base an opinion as to the cause of the insanity. Further, the statistics of insanity and the method of preparing and compiling these statistics have been subjected to a rigid scrutiny, and no opportunity has been lost of obtaining the evidence of medical experts, including Government officers, private practitioners of all classes, and Superin- tendents of Lunatic Asylums and their subordinates, as well as of non-profes- sional persons, as to the relation between hemp drugs and insanity. The Commission have endeavoured to investigate and weigh the popular as well as the scientific view of this subject.
8 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. I. Connection between hemp drugs and violent crime. 10. In regard to the alleged connection between hemp drugs and violent crime, the Commission, in addition to sifting the written and oral evidence, have examined the judicial and other records of cases which have been alluded to by the witnesses as forming the basis, or part of the basis, on which their opinions were framed. Native States. 11. As stated above, the Commission were precluded by the orders of the Government of India from holding formal sittings in Native States, but nevertheless they have endeavour- ed to obtain full and complete information from all the most important Native States in India. In the case of Native States in political relation with the Gov- ernment of India, the Commission, in some cases in personal communication with the Agent to the Governor-General or the Resident, and in other cases by letter, arranged for the collection of the required information. In some of the larger Agencies and States special officers were appointed, through the courtesy of the Agent to the Governor-General or the Darbar, to collect and compile the available information, and much useful information has thereby been placed at the disposal of the Commission. In the smaller States, and in States under the political control of Local Governments, a memo- randum of the system in force, together with statistics so far as avail- able, has generally been furnished by the Political Agent or a responsible officer of the State. Beyond giving the States in question such advice and assistance as they desired in respect to the best methods of conducting their inquiries, indicating clearly the points on which information was desired and supplying lists of questions where required, the Commission did not interfere in any way with the course of these inquiries or select or examine witnesses for themselves. The Army. 12. One of the most important questions with which the Commission had to deal was the investigation of the proportion of the population which indulges in the use of hemp drugs, and of the classes among whom the use is prevalent. The Native Army appeared to offer a suitable field for inquiry in regard to this matter, and accord- dingly, with the permission of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, a series of questions dealing with this and other questions bearing upon the Commission's investigations was issued to all regiments of the British Native Army. The inquiries were made and the answers filled in by the Commanding Officers either with or without the assistance of their medical officers. The results obtain- ed will be found in Chapter VIII. Sketch of the proceedings of the Commission. 13. The Commission first assembled at Calcutta on 3rd August 1893, and after agreeing upon their general plan of operations, and concluding their preliminary arrangements, including the distribution of questions to witnesses, started on the preliminary tour described in paragraph 8 above. The provinces visited were the North- Western Provinces, the Central Provinces, Bombay, Madras, and the Punjab. The Commission were in the North-Western Provinces from 22nd August to 1st September, and had their head-quarters at Allahabad, where the principal Revenue officers of Government were assembled to meet them. During this period the asylums at Patna (Bengal), Lucknow, Bareilly, and Lucknow were visited by
CH. I.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 9 various members of the Commission, and one member proceeded to Naini Tal to consult with His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor on behalf of the Commission. The Central Provinces were visited from 2nd to 11th September, the Com- mission's head-quarters being at Jubbulpore. The asylums at Jubbulpore and Nagpur were inspected, and some of the members met the Chief Commissioner at Pachmarhi. Some of the members also proceeded to Indore to consult the Agent to the Governor-General, and the Commission as a body had an opportunity of making themselves acquainted with the system of cultivation of the hemp plant for ganja which is centralized at Khandwa. From the Central Provinces the Commission travelled to Poona, where they remained from 12th to 18th September in communication with the Government, and where there was an important asylum to inspect. On the way from Poona to Madras the Resident of Mysore was visited at Bangalore, and inquiries were held at the Dharwar Asylum. At Madras the Commission were occupied from the 22nd to 25th September, after which they broke up into two parties-one proceeding to consult with His Excellency the Governor at Ootacamund, and the other to Hyderabad, where important arrangements had to be made for collecting inform- ation from that State. Inquiries were also held at the Madras and Hyderabad Asylums. The two parties rejoined at Bombay on the 30th September, and then proceeded to Simla, where the head-quarters of the Punjab Government were located. On the journey one part of the Commission stopped at Baroda and Mount Abu to arrange for the collection of information in Baroda and the Raj- putana States, while another party held inquiries at the asylums at Colaba, Ahmedabad, and Delhi. At Simla the Commission had their head-quarters from 7th to 24th October, during which interval two members paid flying visits to Lahore, Hyderabad (Sind), and Karachi to inspect the asylums at the two former places and to complete the arrangements made in Sind for the proper selection of witnesses. The second tour, which was mainly devoted to the examination of witnesses, lasted from 25th October to 25th April. The various provinces were visited in the following order, and witnesses were examined at the centres named on the dates mentioned against each:10 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94.

Besides examining witnesses, the Commission continued to prosecute their inquiries in asylums during this tour, visiting all asylums which had not been seen during the preliminary tour. The centres chosen for the examination of witnesses were generally selected with a view to the convenience of the majority of the wit- nesses summoned; but other circumstances, such as the presence of a lunatic asylum or exceptional growth or use of hemp drugs, had some influence on the decision of the Commission in this matter.

The following statement shows the attendance of the members of the Commission during the period occupied in inquiry (3rd August 1893 to 25th April 1894):12 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94.

But, as has already been explained, the action of the Local Governments and Administrations was in almost all cases supplemented by the Commission, who held themselves free to invite the evidence of persons or asso- ciations whose acquaintance with the subject was brought to their notice, or who seemed on any ground to be able to throw any light on the subject. Witnesses of the third class were of course not selected, but were invited in the most public way, as has been already explained, to come forward and lay their views before the Commission, should they desire to do so. The following table shows the number of witnesses in each province whose evidence was received by the Commission:CH. I.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 13 prefaces the volumes of evidence appended to the report. The evidence of all these witnesses is contained in the appendices. The number of persons or associations who submitted written statements of their views in response to the Commission's invitation was extremely limited. In most cases their names appeared in the list of witnesses selected by Local Gov- ernments and Administrations, and they submitted detailed answers to the Com- mission's questions in which their views were fully set forth. In their cases the preliminary written statements, which were not intended to be treated as evidence, but were meant, as it were, to serve as an introduction to the Commission, have not been published, and only the written answers to the questions and the oral examination (if any) has been published. These will be found incorporated in the appendices containing the evidence. In the few cases in which answers to the questions were not furnished, the statements themselves have been treated as evidence, and have been published with the oral examination when such was made. The evidence: Method of treat- ment of14 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. I. the Commission thought the witness could give further information than that con- tained in his paper. In every case, however, the witness was permitted, if he chose to do so, to supplement his written paper by offering any further evidence relevant to the inquiry not already given by him. When a witness was orally exa- mined, his evidence was taken down by a member of the Commission. It was not recorded in the form of question and answer, as this would have involved loss of time, but in the form of a narrative as nearly as might be in the words used by the witness. When the evidence was completed, it was read over to him, and (after any necessary correction) was admitted by him to be correct. This evid- ence, as thus accepted by the witness in each case, is published immediately beneath his written evidence, to which it is supplementary, and in connection with which it requires to be considered. In almost every province some witnesses were examined orally who had not previously submitted written papers. These were either persons who, although they had not answered the questions, appeared to the Commission to be in a position to afford information, and were invited by the Commission when they arrived in the province to appear before them, or they were persons who volun- teered to give evidence while the Commission were actually holding their sittings in the province. In the case of officials who were summoned to appear, but who were unable to do so, and of non-official witnesses who were invited to appear, but failed to do so, the Commission have not excluded their papers from the record. Their written papers are published, but a note is added to the effect that they did not appear before the Commission for oral examination although summoned or invited to attend, as the case may be. In the lists of witnesses prefacing the volumes of evidence appended to this report distinguishing marks are given to indicate those who were examined orally in addition to furnishing written papers, those who gave oral evidence only, and those who failed to attend although summoned or invited to appear.
CHAPTER II. IMPORTANT POINTS CONNECTED WITH THE NATURAL HISTORY OF THE HEMP PLANT (CANNABIS SATIVA). Limitation of discussion. 17. The subject with which the Commission have to deal is surrounded in many of its aspects with a mist of uncertainty and conjecture. It is the business of the Com- mission to remove these doubts as far as possible, and for this end it is incumbent on them to proceed on a basis of ascertained fact and established opinion as regards each branch of the subject. This principle must be applied to the natural history of the plant equally with the other matters on which they have to report. Points for discussion. 18. In regard to the identification and idiosyncracies of the hemp plant, those points only will be noticed which have a direct bearing on the control of the narcotic in its various forms. These points appear to be16 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. II. other hand, the Latin and Greek Cannabis is apparently derived from the Arabic kinnab. De Candolle says that 'the species has been found wild beyond a doubt to the south of the Caspian Sea, in Siberia, near the Irtysch in the deserts of the Kirghiz, beyond lake Baikal, and in Dahuria.' He is doubtful of its being a native of Southern and Central Russia, but suspects that its area may have extended into China, and is not sure about the plant being indigenous to Persia." The only part of India included by Dr. Watt and his authorities in the area of indigenous growth is therefore the Western Himalayas and Kashmir, and that only in doubtful language. Dr. King, Director, Botanic Survey of India, has no hesitation in pronouncing the so-called wild growth of India to be an escape from cultivation; and when it is remembered that Kashmir is on the main line of trade between Central Asia and Hindustan, the wild growth in that country and its neighbourhood may fairly be attributed to accidental importation by the hand of man from the recognized habitat, if not to escape from cultivation carried on at one time or other in the country itself. The evidence of botanists, therefore, may be taken to exclude India from the area of indigenous growth, and it will be seen that the direct inquiries of the Commission tend to confirm this view. Is the fibre plant identical with the narcotic plant? 20. The specific identity of the fibre-yielding and narcotic-yielding plants, point (b), and the points which follow, are important as involving the possibility that the restric- tion of the production of the narcotic by limiting the cultivation may affect a product and an industry which are above suspicion. On the question of identity there is now no difference of scientific opinion. The researches of Dr. Watt are thus summarized: "Cannabis indica has been reduced to Cannabis sativa, the Indian plant being viewed as but an Asiatic condition of that species......The reduction became the more necessary when it was fully under- stood that, according to climate and soil, the Indian plant varied in as marked a degree as it differed from the European............With Cannabis indica differ- ing in so marked a degree according to the climate, soil, and mode of cultivation, it was rightly concluded that its separation from the hemp plant of Europe could not be maintained"; and he compares the hemp plant to the potato, the tobacco, and the poppy, all of which "seem to have the power of growing with equal luxuriance under almost any climatic condition, changing or modifying some im- portant function as if to adapt themselves to the altered circumstances." Dr. Prain, after personal examination of the plant, has recorded his opinion in the following words: "There are no botanical characters to separate the Indian plant from Cannabis sativa, and they do not differ as regards the structure of stem, leaves, flowers, or fruit ............Hemp, therefore, as a fibre-yielding plant in no way differs from hemp as a narcotic-producing one." These are the most recent scientific views, and coming from Indian botanists they carry special au- thority. It may be noted that Dr. W. C. Mackenzie, in an article on Hashish in the "Chemist and Druggist" of 9th July 1893, mentions certain differences between the seeds of Cannabis indica and those of common hemp. In using the name Cannabis indica, and pointing out this difference, is indicated a belief that the two plants are distinct varieties. Description of the hemp plant. 21. At pages 38-39 of his report Dr. Prain has described the hemp plant. There are only two points on which the Commission from their own observations and inquiries feel

CH. II.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 17 justified in correcting that description. Dr. Prain has omitted to notice the fact that the plant varies in the colour of its stem. The dark variety may be, and probably is, an accidental difference merely. But it will be found that the replies to the Commission's questions from Nepal and the memorandum from the Special Assistant Excise Commissioner in Mysore, Mr. McDonnell (para. IIIa),lay stress on the difference, and attribute to the darker variety stronger narcotic properties. The fact is also noticed by witnesses in different parts of India, and the Commission have themselves observed the variety of colour in the plants. And, secondly, in describing the male plant, Dr. Prain writes that there is no trace of even a rudimentary female flower. The Commission found at Khandwa hemp plants having the general appearance of males, but containing a few female flowers or seeds. These were quite distinct from the female plants with abnor- mal male flowers, which were also present in the Khandwa cultivation, and which are mentioned in Dr. Prain's description. The cultivators of Khandwa appeared also to recognize at least one variety of the pure male plant to which they gave a name of its own (Sheoria); but it has not been possible to detect any essential difference between it and the ordinary male plant, though specimens were for- warded to Dr. King. On this subject reference is invited to the description of the cultivation in the Central Provinces and Bombay. Existence of races of the hemp plant yielding the different products. 22. The third point (c) is raised in Dr. Watt's letter (Vol. III Appendices). The function of the Commission is to test by the information they have collected the views therein expressed regarding the probable existence of races capable of yielding as a speciality the different products18 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. II. is described as a process so difficult and laborious that very little of it is prepared. It may be noted that selected flower heads from the bhang cultivation of Sind are used as ganja (ghundi), though it is of inferior quality. The production of charas is not mentioned; but from the account of the cultivation for ganja in Bombay and Gwalior, it would appear that the production of that form of the drug (charas) depends on the quantity of resin secreted in the flower head and the economy of extracting it rather than on any quality inherent in the resin. Dr. Watt's impression that Cannabis is cultivated for hemp in the Godavari districts seems to arise out of the confusion which has always existed in Madras reports on the subject of the hemp drugs, and from which the subject is not yet quite clear in that Presidency. Other fibre plants, such as Crotalaria juncea and Hibiscus cannabinus, whose products go under the name of hemp, have been con- founded with the true hemp. It is now definitely stated in paragraph 7 of the letter from the Board of Revenue, Madras, to the Commission, No. 1839, dated 1st May 1894, on the authority of the Deputy Director, Agricultural Branch of the Board of Revenue, that "Cannabis sativa is never grown in this Presidency for fibre." Attention may in this connection be drawn to pages 3 to 5 of Dr. Royle's work on the "Fibrous Plants of India." He explains the effect of the Indian method of cultivating hemp and flax, involving free exposure of the individual plants to light, heat, and air, in causing the fibre to become woody and brittle instead of flex- ible and strong. He contrasts the European method of cultivation by thick sowing, which, with a temperate climate inducing slow growth, conduces to height and suppleness in the plant and its fibres. He admits that the Indian climate with its comparatively short seasons, great alternations of dryness and of moisture, and considerable extremes of temperature is not the best suited to the production of good flax and hemp. But he suggests that it might be possible by modifica- tions of culture and the selection of suitable sites to grow both these plants within the limits of India so as to yield useful fibre. In the Himalayas only are to be found climate and mode of cultivation of the hemp plant resembling those of Europe.

CHAPTER III. THE EXISTENCE, PREVALENCE, AND CHARACTER OF THE SPONTANEOUS GROWTH. Bengal. The wild growth not found over the whole province. 25. The Commissioner of Excise, Bengal, says in his memorandum that "the wild plant is found in nearly every district, and it grows abundantly in several places." The evid- ence enables the facts to be stated more definitely; and it will be seen that over a large part of the province the spontaneous growth is not so common or abundant that it can with any propriety be called wild. The Patna Division north of the Ganges. 26. The Terai region of Bengal appears to resemble that of the North-West- ern Provinces in having a luxuriant growth of hemp. Beginning from the frontier of the North-Western Provinces, the evidence leaves no doubt that the spontaneous growth is extremely common and plentiful in that part of the Patna Division which lies north of the Ganges. The only witness who raises any doubt on this point is Mr. Williams, Collector of Darbhanga; and he describes the growth as much less common than in Assam, though plentiful on the borders of Nepal. The evidence generally, however, cannot justify any exception being made of the Darbhanga district. The Bhagalpur Division. 27. Eastward from Patna lies the Bhagalpur Division, the region from which the bhang supply of Calcutta is brought. A special inquiry was made in this tract, North Bhagalpur and Purnea, by Mr. B. C. Basu, Assistant to the Director of Land Records and Agri- culture, at the request of the Commission. Mr. Basu does not seem to have explored the waste lands of the Terai; his inquiries relate solely to the populous parts of the country. He says that the growth as a rule "is confined to land in the immediate vicinity of raiyats' holdings. Such land is usually called dihisar in Purnea and Bhagalpur, and is naturally the richest in the village." He says further on that these lands are used as standing ground for the cattle, and that "the washings from them flow over the alleys and ditches in the village; and as there is little or no cultivation at any time of the year, every bit of bare ground which is otherwise suited is covered with a luxuriant mass of wild hemp as soon as the cold weather has set in." The Commission would have been glad to learn more about the lands at a distance from houses. The Collectors of Purnea and Bhagalpur, while confirming Mr. Basu's account, report that the growth springs up notwithstanding that the lands may have been flooded for 3 or 4 months in the rains. It is not confined to waste lands, but comes up with the crops which are sown after the inundations have subsided. It is specially abundant within the influence of the floods of the Kosi river. It is clear then that the growth about homesteads and cultivation is extremely plentiful; and, looking to the whole evidence, the probability is that towards the Terai the wild growth is found in less close association with man, and in great quantity in suitable positions and soils. The Collector of Bhagalpur reports that in the Banka Sub-division, which lies on the south of the Ganges, the growth is not so plentiful, and is found principally on homestead lands. The Rajshahi Division. 28. In the Rajshahi Division the Terai is still credited with heavy growth, and the northern parts of the Dinajpur and Rangpur dis- tricts are specially mentioned; but elsewhere evidence as to abundance has a more uncertain sound. Babu Abhilas Chandra Mukharji
20 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. III. (63), 2nd Inspector of Excise, says that the wild bhang grows luxuriantly all over the division. But this sweeping statement is not generally corroborated. Witnesses do not agree that the growth is abundant, though the fact that there is no licensed sale leaves no doubt that it exists in sufficient quantity to supply the people's wants. The district of Malda, which adjoins the Rajshahi district on the north-east, and is favourably situated as regards proximity to the great bhang-producing district of Purnea, does not appear from the evidence to have much spontaneous growth. It seems probable that the exceptionally favourable conditions associated with the Himalayas and Terai cease at the point where the Ganges swings round the Sonthal highlands, and that a straight line drawn from Sakri Ght to a point on the southern fringe of the Garo Hills would mark the limit of a less abundant growth. The Dacca and Chittagong Divi- sions. 29. But there is evidence that the growth is still common south of this line and east of the Ganges and Bhagirathi, more so under the Garo Hills and along the course of the Brahmaputra than elsewhere. It is hard to realize an area of wild growth quite so large as that mentioned by Babu Abhilas Chandra Mukharji, viz., twenty square miles covered with long grass and hemp plants. Mr. Luttman-Johnson, talking of this very tract, Durgapur thana, says he saw the plant growing more or less thickly over twenty or thirty acres. Babu Abhilas Chandra Mukharji mentions many other places in Dacca and Mymensingh where the plant grows abundantly, and the Collector of Dacca corroborates his evidence regarding the south-west corner of that district. It is evident that in these districts the growth is very prevalent. Sarat Chandra Das (47) says that the growth is dense in places in the Chittagong Division, but he cannot say that it is abundant in any district. The central part of Lower Ben- gal. 30. In the whole tract lying between the Brahmaputra and the Bhagirathi rivers, and bounded on the north by the imaginary line from the Ganges to the Garo Hills, the evidence as to the abundance of the growth is discrepant. The growth is probably most common on the banks of the Ganges and Brahmaputra. South-Western Bengal bounded by the Ganges and Bhagirathi. 31. In the Patna and Bhagalpur Divisions south of the Ganges, and in the Burdwan, Orissa, and Chota Nagpur Divisions, the spontaneous growth is evidently very scanty. The plant is only found where its existence can be accounted for. In this respect the area resembles the southern fringe of the North-Western Provinces. The Tributary States of Orissa. 32. The Tributary States of Chota Nagpur and Orissa are included in this description. Regarding the Garhjat, Mr. Worsley, Commissioner, reported in 1889: "I think it is very doubtful if ganja grows wild to any extent in the Tributary Mahals." And again Mr. Hopkins, Officiating Commissioner of Orissa, wrote in April of the same year: "The prevailing impression that ganja grows wild in the Tributary Mahals appears to me to be wrong." It is true that the Board of Revenue and the Government of Bengal declined to accept this opinion, but it is confirmed by the information gathered by the Commission. The Officiating Superintendent, Tributary Mahals, says indeed in his report that hemp grows in all parts of the Tributary States, but in his oral evidence he says he feels sure that the plant does not exist except in the enclosures of houses.
CH. III.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 21 The Political States of Chota Nagpur. 33. Regarding the Chota Nagpur States, the evidence of the Commissioner, Mr. Grimley, does not describe any but a very occa- sional and sparse growth in certain places, and even this is not corroborated by any local witness. There will be found on the con- trary distinct statements that the wild plant does not exist. The reports from the Seraikela and Kharsawan States in the Chota Nagpur Agency do not men- tion the existence of the wild growth. Kuch Behar. 34. The memorandum of the Kuch Behar State reports that wild hemp grows spontaneously in most parts of the State. The State lies within the belt of Sub-Himalayan growth. Hill Tippera. 35. The report from Hill Tippera makes no mention of the wild growth. It states at the same time that there is no cultivation of the plant. This is incorrect, for there is evidence of some cultivation as well as smuggling from the State, and the wild hemp is frequently referred to in connection with it. The evidence of smuggling comes from Assam as well as Bengal. It is probable that the wild growth is not very extensive, and the information is not sufficient to warrant a decided opinion as to whether the plant sows itself or merely springs from chance seeds dropped near the homesteads. Assam. The wild growth existed before ganja shops were established. 36. The hemp plant grows spontaneously and in considerable quantity in all parts of Assam, including the Brahmaputra and Surma Valleys and the Hill Tracts. One witness states that the wild plant used to grow in Assam before the ganja shops were established, and this would appear to be the fact, because the plant is cultivated on the Himalayan slopes overhanging the Brah- maputra Valley; it is found growing without cultivation in the hill ranges, and in the Naga Hills it is looked upon as a jungle product. The wild growth in the valleys. 37. The Excise Commissioner, Mr. Driberg, has served in the province for thirty years. In his written answers he passes in order over all the hill ranges within and surrounding the province, and concludes by saying that they are all ganja-producing tracts. And referring more particularly to the plain country, he says: "The hemp plant grows with equal abundance in all the districts of the province, and in the semi-inde- pendent hills beyond the frontier. It is never seen in forests or other lands remote from villages, but always near villages or on abandoned village sites . . . . In the interior, remote from tea gardens and the settlements of foreigners, it is not found. So in regard to fields, it is found chiefly where there are foreigners." On the other hand, Dr. Macnamara (20) states that he has found the plant in As- samese villages far away from places where there are foreigners; but it would be difficult to get a place in Assam very far from the gardens. Mr. McCabe, Deputy Commissioner of Kamrup, being questioned about efforts that may have been made to control this spontaneous growth, says that no attempt has been made to exterminate the plant in the hills or in unoccupied lands, but any officer seeing a plant in occupied land is bound to cause it to be uprooted and to prosecute22 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. III. in waste lands is very small and has a tendency to decrease with the spread of occupation, and that active measures of extermination are not necessary. In face of other evidence, it is questionable if this can be accepted as a correct picture of the state of the spontaneous growth in the plains. It is certain that the weedy growth in yards and enclosed ground as well as in the waste places connected with habitations, present or past, is extremely common even in Kamrup. Mr. Gait, Director of Land Records and Agriculture, after appearing before the Commission, has sent notes with reference to Mr. Mc- Cabe's statements, in which he writes that he found the plant growing luxuriantly round the Kamalpur rest-house and within a mile of the one at Tambulpur, which were two of the four camps he stayed at since he entered the district; and he was beginning to think that, if properly looked for, it would be found in almost every village in Kamrup. From the fact that he always found it close to basti land, he was inclined to think that, if it was not actually planted, it was very actively tolerated. Dr. Mullane also says that "in the Kamrup district the hemp plant springs up spontaneously in almost every patch of cultivated ground." Without accepting Mr. Gait's opinion that the growth is fostered by the villagers, the Commission think from the body of the evidence that his description of the prevalence of the growth in Kamrup is not far from the truth, and that with but slight modification it will apply to every plain district of Assam. Regarding the Surma Valley, confirmation of this view is found in the evidence of Mr. Luttman-Johnson (Bengal, 6), an officer of long experience in Assam. The wild growth in the hills. 38. Neither is there any reason to doubt that the plant grows without culti- vation in the hill tracts within and bordering on the province. It is cultivated in the Bhutan Hills, and cannot but run wild there, as it does in other places which are thoroughly congenial. Mr. Driberg speaks of not only the Himalayas, but all the hill ranges within and bordering Assam, as ganja-producing tracts, and it is highly probable that the plant has to a greater or less extent run wild in all of them. Mr. Luttman-Johnson knows it grows wild in the Naga Hills and Bhutan, but thinks it must be from seed accidentally sown. He has seen it wild in the Khasi Hills and in the Mymensingh jungles, presumably at the foot of the Garo Hills. Mr. Godfrey (1) believes it grows wild in the Khasi Hills. Mr. McCabe (5) has seen it wild in the lower ranges of the Naga Hills. It may be doubted if the smuggling which is carried on from the hills in all parts of the province to the plains can be of the wild ganja as stated in the Excise Commissioner's memo- randum, for the produce of the wild plant is of very inferior quality, and it can be got in the plains. The smuggled plant must have been to some extent culti- vated, but its existence in the hills is a decided corroboration of the evidence that the wild plant is found there also. The spontaneous growth must be regarded as wild. 39. It is difficult then to avoid the conclusion that Assam, including both the Brahmaputra and Surma Valleys, with the hill ranges which form part of the province, ought to be classed with the Himalayas and the Terai as a region in which the spontaneous growth has run wild. Manipur. 40. There is only one Manipur witness, and he says nothing about the spon- taneous growth. Mr. Driberg classes the State as a ganja-producing tract, whence the drug is surrep- titiously brought down to the plains. No other witness gives direct evidence

III.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 23 about Manipur; but the prevalence of the spontaneous growth in the hills bordering the State on the Assam side, which is taken to be proved, justifies the inference that the growth must also be common in the State itself.

The evidence tendered to the Commission confirms this description gen- erally; but it may be noted that not a single witness speaks to spontaneous growth in the districts named in the mar- gin, all of which, except Jhansi and Hamirpur, lie north and east of the Jumna. This absence of mention does not prove that the spontaneous growth does not exist, but it justifies the con- clusion that in the central belt it is certainly not such as to deserve the character of wild, and that Mr. Stoker's description gives it as much of that character as it deserves. This central belt is approximately bounded on the north by a line drawn through Muzaffarnagar, Moradabad, Bareilly, Shahjahanpur, and Sitapur to Bahramghat on the Gogra, and thence following the course of that river. Throughout the country lying beyond this line, including the mountains, the spontaneous growth is abundant. It is bounded on the south and south-west by the Jumna river, beyond which the spontaneous growth is rare. Garhwal Tehri. 43. The State of Garhwal Tehri comprises the Himalayan region west from British Garhwal, and there is no reason to suppose that its circumstances as regards the spontaneous growth of the hemp plant differ in any way from the latter district. The Diwan of Tehri gives 2,500 to 4,000 feet as the elevation at which the plant flourishes. Other evidence shows that it grows freely beyond these limits. Rampur. 44. The Rampur State stretches south from below the Terai district. The Revenue Member of the Council of Agency writes that the spontaneous growth is found in the north and north-eastern part of the State. There is nothing to differentiate Rampur from the British districts lying east and west of it in respect to this growth. Punjab. Wild growth in the Himalayas and Terai. 45. The hemp plant grows spontaneously throughout the Himalayas, and in a broad belt along the foot of the mountains. The growth is so free and vigorous that it may without impropriety be called wild, and it does not appear to differ in extent and charac- ter from that of the similar region in the North-Western Provinces. Its preva- lence seems to be most notorious in the districts of Hoshiarpur, Gurdaspur, and Jullundur, because the bhang contractors draw their supplies from, these dis- tricts; but witnesses, many of them of high authority, such as the Commis- sioner of Rawalpindi, speak to its existence in greater or less profusion through- out the submontane districts from Peshawar to Umballa. Contradiction may occasionally be found regarding the density and abundance of the growth, but about its frequent occurrence in this stretch of country there can be no doubt. It has been seen that in other provinces it is the habit of the plant, when it finds itself established in a suitable home like the Terai, to grow very densely and in patches of considerable size, and the Commission are inclined to accept the evidence of those whose statements are in agreement with this knowledge.

CH. III.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 25 The limits of the submontane belt of wild growth. 46. The growth decreases in frequency very rapidly as the Himalayas are left behind. It appears, however, from the evidence to maintain its hold in the Amritsar, Lahore, Karnal, and Shahpur districts further south than in others. As regards three of these districts, special reasons for this persistence may be suggested. Shahpur is watered by the Jhelum, which appears to carry an exceptionally heavy growth on the banks of its upper reaches. Amritsar is not only the great market for bhang as well as charas, but it is the head-quarters of the Sikh religion, and the former drug is largely consumed by the followers of that faith. It seems to be a regular drink or refreshment with the visitors to the Golden Temple. When members of the Commission visited the city, a dense growth of bhang flourished over a large area in the outlying parts of the public gardens and countless plants in the hedgerows surrounding the city. The seeds discarded from the large quantity of bhang that is daily consumed in the city sufficiently account for this growth, and it is probable that the ways leading to Amritsar from the country round are sown with hemp in the same way. The plant is probably propagated in the same manner, but to a less degree, around Lahore, the capital town of the province, and the head-quarters of the Administration. East of Umballa and Karnal the bhang-bearing belt appears to widen out, and its southern boundary would probably pass across the Karnal district. The supposed wild hemp of the Suleiman Range. 47. The Excise Commissioner reports that "the supply of bhang is derived from the wild hemp plant which grows within the prov- ince in the submontane tracts under the Himalayas and the Suleiman Range." The evidence, it has been seen, corroborates the state- ment as regards the Himalayan tract. But it does not do so for the Suleiman region. The existence of the wild growth is not mentioned in Kohat or the Derajat Division. Witnesses (60) and (19) make statements which need explanation. The former says, speaking of the Dera Ghazi Khan district: "In the hill tracts of my ilaka the wild hemp grows here and there to a small extent, but no one consumes it. Sometimes budmashes, however, administer it from evil motives to another person without his knowledge." And again26 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. III. The same witness gives the name of another hemp plant as badal, saying that it is known to grow in the Waziri Hills about 50 miles to the west of Dera Ismail Khan. He describes its leaf as being as broad as that of the madar,which shews that this also is not the true hemp. Spontaneous growth in the plain country. 48. Witness (41) mentions the wild plant as growing scantily on the banks of canals and in waste places in the Delhi district, and its occurrence in one tahsil of the Firozpur district is stated by another witness. These statements may very well be correct, but they do not imply a growth which can properly be called wild in the sense in which the word is now being used, but only a casual and accidental growth. One or two witnesses talk in a general way about spontaneous growth in all districts. Area of wild growth defined. 49. It will be a safe conclusion to say that the wild growth is only to be found in the Himalayas and in a belt of country under those mountains which is very narrow at Peshawar, and gradually widens as it approaches the North-Western Provinces. Self-sown hemp plants may be found elsewhere, but there is no tendency for them to run wild outside the above tract. Punjab States. 50. The wild growth occurs in the Himalayan States, and those of which any part lies within the Sub-Himalayan bhang-bearing belt. No State shows any peculiarity in the capacity for growing wild hemp. The Hill States are numerous, and need not be named. Kapurthala and Patiala are the only States in the plain country from which the spontaneous growth is reported, and it will doubtless be found in those parts of the States which fall within the Punjab tract of wild growth. Patiala has a considerable area of territory in the Himalayas, where the wild growth will be found to exist. The Bahawalpur witnesses say that occasional plants are found in graveyardsCH. III.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 27 Feudatory States. 52. There is no evidence that the plant grows spontaneously in the Feuda- tory States. The spontaneous growth, however, probably exists just as it does in the Province proper. Madras. No official knowledge of wild growth. 53. It seems clear that the spontaneous growth does not prevail in any part of the Madras Presidency to such an extent as to have led to the idea that the plant is wild. The Government memorandum states that nothing is known about the extent of the wild growth; and Mr. Benson, Deputy Director of Agriculture, has only seen some references to its existence in the northern district. The Commissioner of Salt, Abkari, and Separate Revenue, replying to the direct enquiry of the Commissioner of the Orissa Division on this subject in his letter No. 529-Mis., dated 11th May 1887, was unable to say whether the hemp plant grew wild. This is remarkable because the plant has always been cultivated as a regular field crop in various parts of the Presidency; the desultory cultivation in yards is common in certain localities; there are highlands in all parts of the Presidency which would apparently be suitable to its growth without cultivation; and the use of the drugs among the jungle people and the coolies of coffee and tea gardens is by no means unfrequent. The want of official know- ledge of it is a fairly strong indication that the wild growth does not exist, or exists only in inconsiderable quantity. Evidence regarding the wild growth. 54. It is only in the hill regions, such as the zamindaris of Ganjam and Vizagapatam, the Javadi Hills, the Shevaroys and other ranges in the Salem district, the Nilgiris and Wynaad, and the Palni Hills, that there is any reason to suspect spontaneous growth on at all an extensive scale. And the suspicion is not strong, for it has only been possible to elicit from one witness a description of the growth which agrees in any degree with what has been learnt about it in Northern India. This witness is Mr. William Robinson, Missionary, and his evidence must be discounted by the admission that "I am singularly deficient in the power of differentiating plants, but the smell of the hemp plant is well known to me." On the whole it is probable that the growth which this witness saw in the She- varoy Hills was really hemp, but that he has frequently been deceived by other weeds, of which there are several, which bear a certain general resemblance to it. As to the abundance of the growth in the Shevaroys, he is to some extent corrobo- rated by witness (189), who appears to be a practical man, and to speak from personal observation. But his observation is not recent and his statement is not in a convincing form. Other witnesses talk of the spontaneous growth as abundant in the Ganjam Hill Tracts and the South-East Wynaad, and even in the Ceded Districts; but there are equally good witnesses on the other side. The District Forest Officer of North Malabar, who appears to be of a careful and observant habit, says he has seen the spontaneous growth in the Travancore and Tinnevelly Ghts and in the Wynaad, but it was always in the neighbourhood of cultivated plants. He says distinctly: "I have never seen the plant wild where there was no cultivated plant near." He de- scribes the situation which appears to be suitable to the wild growth, and the growth itself as scattered. This is probably the best witness in Madras on this subject. Mr. Long (149) says that he has sometimes seen a few plants growing together which people told him had sprung up spontaneously; but
28 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. III. the most important of such patches of growth appeared to him to have been cultivated. The chance growth of the Presi- dency is not wild. 55. The general conclusion must be that the dense and widespread growth does not exist in the Madras Presidency, but that throughout the Presidency the chance and scattered growth on refuse heaps near villages or in other exceptionally favourable situations, such as old cattle-folds or coolie lines, may occasionally be found, and more commonly in the hill tracts than in the low country. Travancore and Cochin. 56. There is information from Travancore that "in some hilly tracts where the seed was once sown by Kanikars, hillmen, a suc- cession of plants appears to have been kept up with- out fresh plantation. This, however, is not strictly wild or spontaneous growth." The District Forest Officer of North Malabar has also spoken of the spon- taneous growth in the Travancore Hills. This is all the available information on the present subject regarding this State. It seems certain that such spon- taneous growth as does exist is not extensive; that it is intimately associated with cultivation, past or present; and that, though it may possibly succeed in occa- sionally reproducing itself, there is no marked tendency for the plant to runwild. Sondur, Banganapalle, and Pudu- kottai. 57. There is no information about spontaneous growth in the minor Madras States. Their conditions are not in any way different from those of the Presidency generally, and the same extent of spontaneous growth may be expected to exist. Bombay. There is no wild growth. 58. The spontaneous growth is found occasionally in the districts where the plant is cultivated, especially Ahmednagar. It is said by one or two witnesses to occur also in the highlands of the Southern Maratha Country. But in no place does it appear to be either dense or frequent, being represented only by scattered plants on the refuse heaps about villages. Many intelligent witnesses, who have evidently bestowed great care on their inquiries, state positively that the spontane- ous or wild growth does not exist, or are silent on the subject. Mr. Dodgson and Mr. Cumine mention its occurrence in the Dangs, but only as occasional plants. This is a country of forests and hills and scattered hamlets far removed from observation, and having a copious rainfall. The same description applies to the whole of the Western Ghts, and the plant might be expected to run riot in these regions if it were inclined to do so. The Excise memorandum reports that the spontaneous growth does not exist. Aden. 59. The plant does not grow spontaneously in Aden according to the report of the Political Resident. Kathiawar. 60. The plant does not grow freely from self-sown seed in any part of the Kathiawar Agency. A few plants may be found occasionally in fields or gardens or near irrigated crops. They seem to be generally more or less tended where they do exist. They are said to occur sometimes in grass preserves, but the evidence is of the weakest kind.
CH. III.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 29 Cutch. 61. Cutch lies between Sind and Kathiawar. As there is no spontaneous growth in either of the latter provinces, it is un- likely that there should be any in Cutch. The Political Agent's report mentions none. Palanpur. 62. The report of the Chief Minister of Palanpur, the principal State in the Palanpur Superintendency, states that "wild hemp is found to a very insignificant extent in this State." There is clearly no extensive growth, that which is referred to being probably the few plants that spring from chance seed. This description may be held to apply to the whole Agency. Mahi Kantha. Rewa Kantha. 63. No spontaneous growth is reported from the Mahi Kantha or Rewa Kantha Agency. Kolhapur and Southern Maratha Country. 64. The Diwan of Kolhapur reports that "the wild plant is not grown in that State." In the smaller States of the Agency there is some cultivation, but no wild growth. There may be a rare spontaneous growth from chance seeds, but nothing more. Various States. 65. The only native territory in which the hemp plant is definitely stated to grow wild is the Dangs, and there only a few isolated plants. The language used by the Diwan of Cam- bay is ambiguous, but it at all events leaves no doubt that the spontaneous growth is quite unimportant if any exists; and the Superintendent of Police says that the wild plant is not found in the State. Sind. The supposed wild hemp of the Baluch Hills. 66. The spontaneous growth is not reported to occur in the valley of the Indus. Many witnesses speak of a plant called ekoi or akoeoccurring in the hills on the western frontier of Sind as wild bhang. Specimens of the plant have been submitted to Dr. King of Calcutta and Mr. Woodrow of Poona, and pronounced by both to be Hyoscyamus muticus. It is said to be very much more potent than hemp, containing the alkaloid hyosyamine, an isomeride of atropine. Under the name of kohi bhang, "hill bhang," its intoxicating properties are well known to the natives, and it is stated to be smoked like ganja, and sometimes used in the same way as dhatura to facilitate robbery; and its use has occasionally been suspected in the Punjab and Baluchistan, where it is common (Pharmacog. Indica, Vol. II, page 631). The statements describing it as wild hemp are made in confident language, and often with some circumstance as to the manner in which it came to be accidentally sown in the hills. The words ekoi and akoeare probably short forms of bhang-i-kohi, or "bhang of the hills," which is the name used by some persons in the Punjab as well as in Sind. The Commis- sioner in Sind doubted the existence of the wild growth in the Baluchistan Hills as reported to him, and himself submitted specimens of ekoi to Mr. Wood- row with the result stated. No wild growth in the Indus Valley. 67. It is doubtful if the spontaneous growth occurs anywhere in the province, because the rainfall of the Indus Valley is extreme- ly light and the mountains on the western frontier are very arid. Even growth on the rubbish heaps near houses is unlikely on account of the want of water. It is probable that the almost total absence of rain counteracts the favourable conditions which might from the experience of Upper India be supposed to exist in the periodical floods and irrigation from the Indus. 8

Under the regulations in force in Berar, the village officers are held responsible that all ganja of spontaneous growth is uprooted, and the cultivation of the plant is only allowed after license has been obtained. By these arrangements the spontaneous growth appears to be successfully kept under; for only one witness out of 38 can be found to say that it exists, and it may be doubted if he refers to the same plant.

He was unable to procure specimens of the plant in June in reply to the request of the Commission reporting that the plant was not in growth at that season. Under these circumstances, this evidence must be regarded as falling far short of proof. The Commissioner of Pegu (2) had the plant pointed out to him growing outside three villages in Upper Burma among the rubbish heaps. He would not have known the plant if it had not been point- ed out to him. The Commissioner of Akyab mentioned the scanty and scattered growth in his division of a plant which the Chittagonians call boil ally, and which he supposed to be a species of wild hemp. He has kindly sent specimens of the plant in answer to a request from the Commission, and they are found to belong to two species of Sida, viz., Sida spinosa, L., and Sida carpinifolia, L. These plants have no narcotic properties. The Commissioner of the Eastern Division, Upper Burma, who has been at some pains to make enquiries, and the Deputy Commissioner of Mandalay can give no informa- tion of the wild growth, though both have apparently come across cultiva- tion of the plant. The Deputy Commissioner of Toungoo mentions the wild growth as existing, though not abundant, in Prome and Shwebo. The Inspector-General of Police in an expedition north-east of Bhamo found that his men were getting some kind of ganja from the Kachins, who gathered it in the jungles. A specimen of the ganja from these hills has been examined, and con- sisted merely of leaves and tops of the plant rolled into balls, and showing no signs of cultivation or preparation. A District Superintendent of Police states that in Upper Burma the plant is often seen growing near villages. No wild growth in the settled districts, but probably exists in the northern mountain ranges 75. The evidence cannot be accepted as showing more than a casual growth in the neighbourhood of villages, which could easily be accounted for. It can neither be extensive in any particular case, nor can the cases be very numerous. Except the doubtful report from Mergui, there is no evidence of any tendency in the growth to reproduce itself and spread. These remarks apply to the settled districts only. The plant probably has run wild in the Kachin country and in the mountain ranges adjoining China, Assam, Manipur, Lushai, and Tippera. Mysore. 76. The report of Mr. McDonnell, Special Assistant Excise Commissioner, shows that hemp sprung from chance seed is often found in all the eight districts of the Mysore State; but it does not appear to be abundant anywhere or more frequent in one district than another. The seed thrown away on dust heaps finds its way with the man- ure into fields and gardens. It is reported both from Mysore and Bangalore that when such plants are discovered they are uprooted, and that prosecutions are instituted if there is evidence of their having been cultivated. One informant states that abundant growth is to be found in three districts; but, with this excep- tion, the official account is generally confirmed, and may be accepted as correct. Rajputana.

32 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. III. sion that the wild and spontaneous growth of which mention is made is due to the germination of seed which has fallen by chance in favourable situations. There is no indication that the plant is inclined to run wild in this region. Central India. 78. Mr. Gunion has collated the information furnished in the official memo- randa from the States of the Central India Agency, and these have not been forwarded, with the exception of a memorandum of the Minister to His Highness the Maharaja Holkar. Mr. Gunion reports that "there appears to be no spontaneous growth of the hemp plant in Central India." The Minister says that "here and there a plant may be seen by road or river side or near the huts of fakirs, etc., due to the dropping of the hemp seed by consumers." There is no reason, except perhaps the some- what greater prevalence of cultivation, why the accidental growth should be more common in the States of the Central India Agency than in those of Rajputana. It may safely be assumed that there is no material difference between the two Agencies in this respect. Hyderabad. 79. The official memorandum by the Director of Agriculture and Commerce of the Hyderabad State reports no wild growth. The spontaneous growth, if it does exist, is not plentiful, and is only such as may be found all over India springing up directly in exceptionally favourable situations from seed accidentally sown. Baroda. 80. The official report on the use of hemp drugs in the Baroda State by Anant Gangadhar Khoti states that "wild ganja is not to be found in this part of the country. It is neither cultivated nor does it grow spontaneously in any part of His Highness's Dominions;" and again "in none of the districts of this State does the hemp plant grow spontaneously." There may possibly be some confusion in the mind of the reporter as to the wild ganja plant being specifically distinct from that which is usually cultivated, for there is some small extent of cultivation in the State. But it may be safely inferred that the hemp plant has nowhere run wild, even if a chance plant may occasionally be found. Kashmir. 81. Information regarding Kashmir is derived from memoranda by the Gov- ernors of Kashmir and Jammu and Muhammad Hayat Khan, Member of the Kashmir State Council. According to the last-named authority, the spontaneous growth in Jammu resem- bles in its character and the localities it affects the growth in the plains of the Punjab. He does not appear, however, to have any very exact idea of the latter growth; for he places many localities on the same footing, in some of which the growth is common, and in others scanty or even wanting. This much may be gathered, however, with tolerable certainty, that the growth in Jammu is not so abundant as in the more elevated tract of Kashmir. The tract of profuse growth in Kashmir mentioned by Muhammad Hayat Khan is Kashmir proper, extending from Baramula to Verinag and Shopayan. The country lying between Adham- pur and Banhal in the Jammu province, as well as the jagirs of Bhaddarwah and Poonch, have also an abundant growth. Two kinds of wild growth in Kashmir proper. 82. The memorandum of the Kashmir Governor mentions two kinds of wild growth which appear to have somewhat distinct characters. The growth called talia consists of the female plant, and is found in the Anantnag district and the Nagam tahsil of the
34 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. III. ranges. It may very well be doubted if without these aids the plant would long survive in the low country under the vicissitudes of the Indian climate and seasons. The plant appears to be very hardy when it is once well established, but it is clear from the distribution of the wild growth in India that the conditions of soil and climate under which it can attain full growth are limited. Conditions favourable to the wild growth. 86. It will be seen from the description of cultivation in Bengal that the seeds will only germinate properly if the nursery is kept thoroughly dry and the rainfall is not excessive. And throughout the growth the plant prefers a light, permeable, well drained soil. Similar evidence is furnished by the facts connected with cultivation in the Central Provinces and Bombay and the direct testimony of witnesses in answer to the latter part of the Commission's question 13. The soil need not be rich for the mere growth of the plant, for it will be found on a ballast heap as well as a dunghill. The essential conditions noted above are present in the Himalayas with the additional encouragement of a moderate temperature. If the rainfall should sometimes be tropical and excessive, it is carried off rapidly, and the seed or seedling has every chance of surviving it. The seed seems to germin- ate at the elevation of Simla in May and June, and it has five or six or seven months to grow and ripen its seed before the frosts come upon it. In the Hima- layan submontane tract the seed germinates in November or December, i.e.,after the excessive moisture of the monsoon has sunk away from the surface soil, leaving it light and friable. The growth is favoured by the light cold weather rains, and does not meet with any very trying conditions unless it wanders very far from the shelter of the mountains. If it does, it will in all probability be burnt up by the fierce dry heat of the months from March to May or June. Protected by the mountain and forest air, it survives to ripen its seed, or perishes with the advent of the monsoon. The plant is not regular as to the time of germinating, and it seems to be later in the Assam Valley than in Hindustan. But in the same patch of growth plants will be found in all stages from the seedling to the flower, if not the seed bearer. Conditions unsuitable to the wild growth prevailing in other parts of India. 87. It is evident that throughout India outside the demarcated region there must be conditions unfavourable to the spontaneous growth. They may be conditions of permanent unsuitability or recurring vicissitudes. Probably both operate to keep the growth in check. In a very general way may be indicated heavy soils, short seasons with severe alternations of dryness and moisture, extreme drought as in Baluchis- tan, Sind, and Rajputana, excessive and continuous rain as on the Western Ghts, and seasons of abnormal drought or abnormal moisture. Where, as in Travancore, the plant is alleged to reproduce itself, an unusually wet season may operate as a very effectual check to extension of the growth, either eliminating it for the time, or thrusting it back into a few well-drained localities. Areas where the spontaneous growth may be important outside the region of wild growth. 88. South of the demarcated boundary of wild growth will be seen on the map (Vol. III Appendices) two areas in lighter shading. One includes the central belt of spontane- ous growth in the North-Western Provinces; the other the country between the Ganges and Bhagirathi on the one side and the Eastern Hill Tracts on the other stretching down to Calcutta. In these areas the spontaneous growth may under favourable conditions of site and season attain some importance.
CHAPTER IV. EXTENT OF CULTIVATION, AND ITS TENDENCY TO INCREASE OR DECREASE. Bengal. Cultivation confined to a limited tract. 89. In Bengal the law (section 5 of Bengal Act VII of 1878) forbids the culti- vation without a license from the Collector of plants from which intoxicating drugs are produced. The cultivation of the hemp plant is accordingly confined to a compact tract having a radius of about sixteen miles, and lying in the three districts of Dinajpur, Raj- shahi, and Bogra. The reasons why this tract was selected are not authorita- tively stated. Cultivation was formerly carried on in the Jessore district also, but that was suppressed in 1875. The present ganja tract was probably found to be most suitable to the cultivation of the drug, and it was obviously an advantage to the excise administration to have the production confined to one area where economical and efficient arrangements could be made for supervising it. There is no unlicensed cultivation in the tract, and the tract is being reduced in area. 90. There is practically no clandestine cultivation within this tract. The Ex- cise Commissioner writes that "owing to the area in which cultivation is permitted being extremely limit- ed, and to the close supervision there, there is every reason to believe that un- licensed cultivation has been all but suppressed." The ganja tract appears to have a tendency to further concentration. The 1st Assistant Supervisor of ganja cultivation states that it is now included within a radius of about fourteen miles, having been reduced from a radius of twenty miles since 1866, and he gives the following explanation of the change: "The gradual reduction in the extent of the tract was due to the fact that by the removal of jungles in the villages not far off Naogaon more land became generally available for cultivation, and more ganja was produced. Purchasers having ganja near Naogaon do not naturally like to go to distant villages for their supplies." The remote villages in the north, south, and east of the tract have accordingly given up the cultiva- tion. The area cultivated. 91. The area cultivated in 1892-93 was 3,540 bighas, an area far larger than the crop has occupied for twenty years past. But in the year 1891-92 the cultivation was the least in the same period, and doubtless the short outturn had to be made up in the fol- lowing season. The cultivation of the two years together is not remarkably high. The following explanation by the Excise Commissioner must be read with the statistics of cultivation: "It will be observed that, except in the past year, there has been no material increase in the area under ganja cultivation during the last twenty years. The column shows the quantity of land in which the crop finally matured, excluding such land as was cultivated, but in which the plants failed altogether; and therefore, although it would appear that cultivation was greatly curtailed during the years 1875-76, 1878-79, 1879-80, 1885-86, and 1891-92, this was not really the case in all the years excepting 1885-86, as the plants in large areas under cultivation were destroyed in these years by heavy floods, and such lands were not taken into account. The decrease in the area cultivated in 1885-86 was due to the smaller profits of the cultivators in the pre- ceding two years. The high price which the drug had realised in 1891-92 owing to wholesale failure of the crop in the previous year caused by inundation
36 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. IV. induced a large number of raiyats to take up lands for cultivation during the following year. Some raiyats are regular growers of ganja, and annually set apart a portion of their holdings for the purpose; others are induced to take to ganja cultivation by the high profits of one year to abandon it again when prices fall." The evidence furnishes no better account of the fluctuations than this. A bigha is about one-third of an acre in Bengal. The cultivation of 1892-93, therefore, amounted to 1,180 acres, and the average of the last five years from 1888-89 to 1892-93 is 824 acres. Clandestine cultivation: not on a large scale. 92. Leaving the ganja tract, the evidence gives reason to suppose that there is a certain amount of rearing of scattered plants. This is, of course, carried on secretly, and in the places where the wild or spontaneous growth flourishes detection is more difficult. The Hon'ble Mr. Lyall thinks that the quantity of bhang that is now exported from the Bhagalpur Division shows that there must be cultivation to a consider- able extent in that part of the country. He means that the bhang which is exported as wild must often be fostered, and perhaps to some extent sown and tended, by the occupants of the lands on which, or in the neighbourhood of which, it grows. Mr. Westmacott holds similar views because he has never found the wild plant in the jungle at a distance from habitations, but he does not indicate the localities to which his remarks apply. On the other hand, the Assist- ant to the Director of Land Records and Agriculture, who made special enquiries in the region referred to by Mr. Lyall, reports: "I could find no evid- ence of the hemp plant being actually cultivated in any part of Purnea and Bhagalpur. Everywhere it came up as a weed. In some places, however, where the plants did not grow in abundance, and would therefore seem to be an object of considerable value to bhang drinkers, I observed signs of its having been looked after with some degree of care." He then describes the signs of the plants having been attended to, and proceeds: "All this made me suspect that the people knew a great deal more about the bhang plant than they were willing to avow." This evidence is a partial corroboration of the high authorities named above, but it points rather to the surreptitious production of ganja in small quantity than to the cultivation on a large scale of the plant which the contractors carry away as bhang. And all the other evidence of the cultiva- tion of the wild plant and of unlicensed cultivation generally refers more or less distinctly to the rearing of a few plants near houses, or in enclosures, or in the midst of crops, and not to operations of a more extensive kind. The character of the clandestine cultivation. 93. This desultory cultivation, either from ganja seed or by rearing plants which have sprung up of themselves, occurs every- where, though the evidence does not give the impres- sion that it is common anywhere. It is stated in Mr. Gupta's memorandum that there were 86 arrests and 71 convictions on this account in the year 1892-93. Arrests were made in 25 districts, "but all the cases were for growing a few plants (very often a single plant) in the courtyards of houses." Babu Abhilas Chandra Mukharji says that "in almost all the districts in which cases of illicit culti- vation have been detected, the plants had been grown from the seeds of the Rajshahi ganja." But Mr. Basu's report and such evidence as the first part of the following extract point rather to the nurture of self-sown plants. Babu Pran Kumar Das (43) states: "I prosecuted and also tried some cases of
CH. IV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 37 nourishing and promoting the growth of hemp plants. There was ample evid- ence of nourishment, such as soil properly prepared, watering, manuring, and otherwise taking care of, but in no case was there any evidence of cultivation. I, however, suspected that it was cultivated in a few cases. In Gaya I found plants grown in a field and being taken care of just as other crops. Generally the ganja smokers grew it in places hidden from the public view. Inside house compounds a few only are grown. The largest (sic) I saw was a field in Gaya, may be 20 or 25." The divisions where clandestine cultivation appears to be most com- mon. 94. The Bhagalpur, Patna, Dacca, and Rajshahi Divisions appear to be those in which this illicit rearing is most prevalent, and the districts of Jessore, Cuttack, and Midnapur are also mentioned, but by only one witness in each case. It will be seen that this distribution agrees pretty closely with the prevalence of the wild growth. The quality of some of the evidence may be judged from that of a zamindar who wrote that "hemp (ganja) is said to be cultivated in certain parts of the Mymensingh district bordering the river Jamuna." The Board of Revenue ordered the Collector of Mymensingh to report on this allegation, with the result that the babu could not specify the villages in question, and that he was clearly, in the Collector's opinion, labouring under some mis- apprehension. The witness's statement indicated cultivation of a far more sys- tematic kind than really existed, but it is unlikely that his information was entirely mistaken, and there is evidence in corroboration of the desultory kind of cultivation in Mymensingh. The evidence as a whole does not justify the belief that the wild plant is systematically cultivated or fostered to the extent sus- pected by Mr. Lyall even in the Bhagalpur and Monghyr districts, but it does show that the secret and desultory kind of cultivation is not uncommon in the divisions above named, and is rare in other parts of the province. Kuch Behar. 95. Cultivation of the hemp plant is prohibited in the State of Kuch Behar, and it is probable that secret cultivation is only carried on to the same extent as in the surrounding British territory. Tributary States of Orissa. The extent and character of the cultivation. 96. It is notorious that a considerable amount of ganja and bhang is produc- ed in the Garhjat. It is largely consumed in the Bri- tish districts of Orissa, being either smuggled in or imported under pass. At one time the cultivation of the plant was prohibited within three miles of the British frontier, but that restriction has been removed, and it is now entirely uncontrolled. It is difficult to gauge the extent of the practice. In the collection of correspondence on this subject, the Commissioner is quoted as reporting that there were 1,000 consumers in the Angul State alone, and that they all grew ganja, selling only the surplus above their own wants. Babu Abhilas Chandra Mukharji holds the opinion that the outturn is very considerable, and capable of supplying the wants of all Orissa. One witness describes a spontaneous growth appearing in fertile places and never abundant; evidently the sort of growth which commonly springs up on rubbish heaps in the neighbourhood of habitations. He states that there is no cultivation, but in saying this he must be referring to regular field culture, for he states that people grow the plant for their own wants and sometimes sell it, the total production in his State being about twenty maunds a year. The District Officer of Angul (34) describes the same sort of cultivation, and says 10
38 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. IV. that he has never seen more than twenty plants growing together. This account is confirmed by the Khas Tahsildar and Deputy Collector in Angul (73) and by Mr. Toynbee (4), who is the only official witness of superior rank who has made a tour of any duration in that country. It is pretty clear that there is no regular field cultivation in the Garhjat, and that the homestead or garden cultiva- tion is quite uncontrolled and extremely common. No decided evidence of increase in the cultivation. 97. Witnesses (62) and (52) think that the cultivation is increasing, the former because the sale of Rajshahi ganja in Orissa has fallen off, and the latter because the restrictions on cultivation in the Tributary States have been withdrawn. Witness (13) of the Central Provinces, who is Extra Assistant Commissioner and Diwan of the Sonpur State, reports that the cultivation in the Boad State where it borders on Sonpur has increased since 1889 "because (1) it has not been allowed in the latter State; (2) it can be had cheaper than that supplied from the Government godowns; (3) people say that ganja manufactured from plants cultivated in the Boad State, which are similar to those cultivated before in Sonpur, is liked by them better than the flat ganja, which they think is more injurious to their health." It may be that the prohibition of cultivation in the Central Provinces States has given an impulse to it in the Garhjat even beyond the limits indicated by this witness. But it cannot be said that there is evidence of a decisive character showing any important extension of cultivation of late years. Political States of Chota Nagpur. Cultivation is under restriction. 98. All the detailed information that can be gathered of cultivation in the political States of Chota Nagpur comes through Mr. Grimley, Commissioner of the Division. One or two other witnesses who mention it state only the fact of its occurrence. In 1890 Mr. Grimley made special enquiries in the States on the subject, and the summary of replies from Sirguja, Udaipur, Gangpur, and Bonai seems to show that in all of them the cultivation is regularly practised, but everywhere under some sort of restriction. It would seem that the restrictions date back to 1883, and were imposed on account of representations from the authorities of the Central Provinces that considerable smuggling was being carried on from these States into that territory. It is proposed at present only to ascertain as far as possible the extent and character of such cultivation as exists. The character and extent of the cultivation. 99. Regarding the character, it cannot be discovered that there is any systematic field cultivation. Mr. Grimley states that "there is no regular cultivation. In some of the Tributary States people smoking ganja grow the plant at their doors according to their requirements for smoking and drinking; but this is done only on a small scale." It appears from Mr. Grimley's report of 1890 that the produce is of inferior quality, and it may be concluded that the produce as well as the cultivation very much resemble those of the adjoining Garhjat. Regarding the extent of this cultivation, there is no apparent reason why it should be less than in the Garhjat, unless it be the absence of such an outlet as the Garhjat possesses in the bhang-consum- ing population of Puri, and the restrictions which the authorities of Chota Nagpur have succeeded in enforcing. Mr. Grimley thinks that the local production is now insignificant, and he mentions as proof of this that the
CH. IV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 39 Raja of Gangpur some five or six months ago applied for permission to import ganja. On the other hand, reference may be made to a report of the Commissioner of Chota Nagpur in 1889: "The result of the inquiry was to show that a good deal of ganja was being grown, and was being sold in the Gangpur bazars to be brought into Sambalpur for sale," qualified by the follow- ing: "I have just passed through the Gangpur State, but have not visited the parts immediately bordering on Sambalpur. So far as the State generally is concerned, I have not been able to hear anything of a general cultivation of ganja, and I think it probable that the plant is grown chiefly on the borders of Sambal- pur." No more definite estimate can be formed of the extent of the cultivation than that it is very considerably less than in the Garhjat States. The Chief of Jashpur, the State memoranda from Seraikela and Kharsawan, and other infor- mants from Gangpur and Sirguja state that there is no cultivation at all, and it is said that in Sirguja the consumer has to import the drug. This evidence would indicate that in a great part of the country the practice of cultivation must be quite uncommon. Hill Tippera. 100. Several witnesses speak to the cultivation of the plant in Hill Tippera, but they give little detail. It can be gathered, how- ever, that the cultivation is of the ruder sort, the seed of the wild plant being often used. It is probably inferior to that of the Garhjat and the casual yard cultivation of the plain country. Otherwise it would have attract- ed the attention of Government, and the witnesses would have had more to say about it. Regarding the extent of cultivation, the evidence of a local officer, Babu Govind Chandra Basak (44), is probably the best. He says: "Very little ganja, say a few srs, are grown in the Tippera Hills. The quantity is very small, for the hill authorities now import ganja under a pass from the Sudder (Tippera) golas." Still a small amount of smuggling into the plain country, both of Bengal and Assam, is said to occur. The State memorandum reports that "the cultivation of hemp is not carried on in the State." Assam. Cultivation prohibited and clandes- tine cultivation unimportant. 101. There is no authorized cultivation in the districts of Assam which are under settled administration, and prosecutions are regularly instituted against persons in whose ground the plant is found growing, if it bears any sign of having been nurtured and tended. The result is, in Mr. Godfrey's words: "This sort of cultivation is kept in check by the district officers, so there is no considerable area of it." This opinion is to be accepted rather than that of Mr. Gait, which has been quoted above, that the growth is very actively tolerated by the villagers. The plant sows itself and grows vigorously all over Assam, and there must, of course, be many instances of the desultory sort of cultivation, for the produce of the untended growth is very inferior, and the temptation to nurse a few plants is great. But there is no winking at the practice, and it cannot be regarded as important. Cultivation in the hill ranges in and bordering the province. 102. In the Himalayan region on the northern frontier the regular cultivation probably resembles that which prevails throughout those parts of the same mountains about which there is more complete information, and consists of the more or less skilful cultivation of small patches in the immediate neighbourhood of homesteads; and it doubtless extends to the extreme north-east of the province, for there is evidence of it as far as the country of the Miris. It will probably be found also in the lofty ranges towards the Hukong valley and the north of Burma,

In fact, there is information of the plant being cultivated with some care for fibre and the drugs in the adjoining Kachin Hills. But the evidence regarding the hill tracts within the province and on the southern frontiers points to cultivation of a very in- ferior sort, if indeed the plant is tended at all. It is said that the Nagas regard the plant as a jungle product, and that the ganja smuggled from the hills is hardly distinguishable from the produce of the wild hemp. North-Western Provinces. Extent of cultivation in the Hima- layan Division. 103. In describing the wild growth of the North-Western Provinces, reference was made to cultivation for the production of bhang in the districts of Farakhabad and Hardoi. The true hemp plant is also very widely cultivated in the Himalayan Division principally for its fibre, but yielding charas, bhang, and seeds as secondary products. The Himalayan cultivation is irregular and scattered, but it has been estimated to amount to 250 acres in the Almora district, and, more accurately measured, at 580 acres in Garhwal. Compared with the spontaneous growth of the mountains themselves and of the region lying below them, this extent of growth is not very important, for the plant cultivated for fibre seems to be little superior in narcotic properties to the spontaneous growth.

Turning to the plain country, the official returns give the marginally noted areas of cultivation in the district of Farakhabad, or Fatehgarh as it is called in Mr. Stoker's memorandum, for the last fourteen years. The Joint Magistrate and Excise Officer (No. 29) of the district, who presumably has access to the local records, quotes very different figures, showing a decrease of the area from 691 bighas in 1891-92 to 561 bighas in 1892-93. There is no apparent reason why the official return should not be accepted, and it shows a decided tendency for the cultiva- tion to increase. The reason may probably be correctly traced in the sentence of Mr. Stoker's memorandum: "All this plant is converted into bhang, which is of a superior quality, technically known as tatia (from a village in Fatehgarh district), and commanding a much higher price than the wild bhang of the sub- montane tracts." Regarding the cultivation in the Hardoi district, the official return only gives one acre in the year 1891-92. This seems hardly consistent with paragraph 9 of Mr. Stoker's memorandum, which indicates a considerable export from Hardoi; but it is possible that the explanation may be found in the fact that the cultivation is not pure, but often mixed with other crops, and that it is therefore impossible to measure it. The practice of the less systematic sort of cultivation may be very prevalent in Hardoi notwithstanding that it is not recorded. Several witnesses, however, state positively that it is decreasing. Patsan is not hemp (Cannabis). 105. The evidence generally corroborates the official account, but many witnesses have been misled by the word patsanhaving been used to signify the hemp plant in the translation of the Commission's questions issued by the North-Western Provinces Government. Patsan is the local name for the Hibiscus cannabinus("Field and Garden Crops of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh"CH. IV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 41 Homestead cultivation in the plains. 106. It does not appear that any regular field cultivation exists in the plain country beyond that which has been above described. Such cultivation as there is consists of the rearing of a few plants near houses, the tending of scattered plants sown accidentally, and perhaps the surreptitious sowing in the midst of crops calculated to afford concealment by their size and their general similarity to the hemp plant. Referring partly to this sort of cultivation in connection with the spontaneous growth, Mr. Stoker says that "in some districts the amount produced by these forms of sporadic growth is considerable, and is a constant source of complaint by the drug contractors;" and the evidence corroborates this view. He thinks, broadly speaking, that it prevails to a greater or less extent in all parts of the province lying north and east of the Jumna, and this comprises by far the greater part of the province. South of the Jumna, the Collector of Jhansi thinks that a good deal is grown in a quiet way for domestic use; and it is not unlikely, as there is no absolute prohibition, that all along the southern fringe of the province this sort of cultivation may be occasionally found. The range of cultivation in Garh- wal. 107. The best informants regarding the cultivation of the Himalayan region are Mr. Gillan (21), Joint Magistrate of Moradabad, Murlidhar (248), Drug contractor of Moradabad, Pandit Ganga Dutt (56), a retired Deputy Collector, and Dharma Nand Joshi, Settlement Deputy Collector (49). The two first allege that the cultivation is spreading because of the enhanced value of charas; the third also alleges increase, but attributes it to the general usefulness of the plant. Dharma Nand Joshi takes the opposite view, and gives as reasons for decrease that the people have become more civilized, and are changing their habits as regards the use of hemp for clothing; that newly cleared forest land, which is peculiarly suited to the plant, is no longer available; and that other crops have been found more profitable. The last witness's description of the distribution of the cultivation is interesting. It is cultivated very extensively, but more for its fibre and seeds than for charas. In the warmer parts to the south the people wear cotton clothes and are not dependent on hemp. In the north also little hemp is sown, and that in but few villages, because the people keep goats and wear woollen clothes, using the hemp only for their chabel or shoes, and making but little charas, which they do not commonly sell, but give to fakirs visiting Badrinath and Kedarnath. In the parganas of Chandpur and Devalgarh more largely, and to a less degree in Barah Syun, Talla and Malla Salans, Choundkote, and Badhan, the plant is widely cultivated. Roughly speaking, it is grown in about one-third of the Garhwal district. In the portion last named every cultivator of the Khasia or Dom caste in every village which is situated at an altitude of between 4,000 and 7,000 feet sows a plot equivalent to two or eight perches. Cultivation discouraged by the idea that it is illegal: Local pro- duction of ganja has decreased. 108. There is no prohibition in this province against the cultivation of hemp, but nevertheless it is clear that a contrary impression is abroad, as is the case in other provinces which are similarly situated in this respect. Mr. Bruce, of Ghazipur (28), thinks that as regards his district the belief "is traceable to the fact that in the adjoining districts of Bengal free cultivation is not allowed." The mere fact that the sale of the drugs is a Government monopoly might well give it wider circulation. Several of the witnesses evidently think that the culti- 11
42 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. IV. vation is illegal, and there is some evidence that cultivation was formerly carried on in some of the Oudh districts until it was suppressed by authority. Witness (135) says that in the time of the King of Oudh bhang used to be cultivated in gardens abundantly. Witness (251) speaks of Mahadeva ganja (in large bundles) being formerly made in Sitapur and Nawabganj. Witness (61) says that the district authorities having heard of the practice in Loohaisar, tahsil Fatehpur, district Barabanki, forbade it. Witness (247) mentions Sitapur and Lakhimpur and Kheri as districts where ganja was formerly cultivated, and that it has now disappeared in the Province of Oudh. According to this witness, it was fostered by the Nepalese in the parts of the province which were formerly under their domination; and it would seem that the Mahadeva ganja got its name from a place in Barabanki where the cultivation was formerly carried on. This origin for the name is confirmed by the evidence of other witnesses. Mr. Stoker is therefore probably mistaken in supposing that this sort of ganja was imported from Nepal. The evidence leaves the impression that a system of prac- tical restriction is going on tending to confine the cultivation to the districts of Farakhabad and Hardoi. It also seems certain that the local production of ganja has of late years very considerably decreased. Rampur. 109. The only Rampur witness states that there is no cultivation of the hemp plant in Rohilkhand, but there can be little doubt that the sporadic cultivation prevails in Rohil- khand and Rampur to the same extent as in the neighbouring British dis- tricts. Garhwal and Tehri. 110. The description which has been given of the general prevalence of Hima- layan cultivation must be accepted for native Garhwal and Tehri. There is no memorandum from the State and no evidence relating exclusively to it. Punjab. Himalayan cultivation. 111. The Himalayan cultivation of the Punjab does not differ from that of the North-Western Provinces, but from the fact that there is none in Kashmir, it would appear to decrease in frequency westward. The plant is grown principally for fibre and in small scattered patches, so that its area cannot be estimated. Mr. Anderson (10), however, ascertained in 1880 that the area in Kulu and Plach was then about 200 acres. Witness (71) states that in British Lahoul every zamindar cultivates a small patch for the sole purpose of obtaining its fibre, and that charas, which he calls bhang, is imported. Bhang cultivation in the south- west part of the province. 112. In the south-west angle of the province there is a small amount of systematic cultivation for the production of bhang. The Excise Commissioner reports that this does not exceed 100 acres. The evidence gives figures for some districts. Thus witness (68) estimates the produce of the Muzaffargarh district at 100 maunds, which would require some 10 or 12 acres of crop. Witness (24) states that the area in the Jhang district in 1893 was only 20 kanals. In Dera Ghazi Khan the area seems to be about 30 acres. Five acres are said to be cultivated in Shahpur. Several witnesses talk in general terms of cultivation for bhang being practised. Some describe the cultivation as consisting of the rearing of a few plants in yards and gardens by fakirs and other consumers. Witness (39)
CH. IV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 43 states that cultivation is carried on in every district more or less, "but more so in Hoshiarpur, Derajat, and other frontier districts." All this cultivation is stated to be for the production of bhang. Ganja is not smoked in the Punjab. The cultivation of the more systematic kind is probably not understated at 100 acres. The desultory cultivation of a few plants seems to be a wide-spread practice; but the total amount of bhang produced by it cannot be important44 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. IV. been chiefly carried on during the last twenty years are Nagpur and Nimar, but up to the year 1878-79 licenses for cultivation of small areas were granted in one year or other in twelve other districts, of which Wardha and Chhindwara were the most important. From this year cultivation was confined to Nagpur and Nimar. It gradually fell off in the former of these districts, and since 1890-91 it has been restricted by law to the Nimar district. The Deputy Commissioner of Nimar now reports that "ganja is grown in sixty or seventy villages in Nimar. The culti- vation is confined to the western half of the Khandwa tahsil." And he gives the following figures of area for the last three years:CH. IV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 45 that they must accept that view. The Inspector-General of Police and Prisons is the only witness who believes that it is common. Mr. Naylor, District Super- intendent of Police, states that "about six or eight cases are annually reported of the ganja or hemp plant being grown in baris;" but he adds: "I think the illicit cultivation has now almost ceased." Some few witnesses state that hemp is some- times raised from the seed of the wild plant, and in saying this they must have the irregular cultivation in view; but the same witnesses do not clearly depose to the existence of such cultivation in the Central Provinces. Feudatory States. 119. The Feudatory States, most of which lie in the extreme east of the province, have agreed not to allow cultivation and to import their ganja from the Government godowns at Khandwa. It is possible that the yard cultivation which was formerly common has not been entirely suppressed in these States, for it is unlikely that the super- vision in such remote and wild tracts can be very strict. But the responsible officers of some of them46 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. IV. probable that the Collector here, as elsewhere, has confounded the area of the narcotic hemp plant (Cannabis sativa) with the fibre hemp (Crotalaria juncea),which is a totally distinct plant. The Board has been informed by Mr. Benson, Deputy Director, Agricultural Branch of the Board of Revenue, that the Cannabis sativa is never grown in this Presidency for fibre, and that the hemp plant grown for fibre must be the Crotalaria juncea." Under these circumstances it is useless to make a detailed examination of the figures of cultivation for past years, and there is little chance of its being possible to arrive at any definite conclusion as to whether the area of regular cultivation tends to increase or decrease. The area under regular cultivation in 1893-94 appears from the statistical table and the correspondence arising out of it to be as follows:CH. IV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 47 restrictions may have reduced the cultivation which serves the markets, but must encourage the home growth, which is not illegal, for private con- sumption. Several other witnesses infer that there must be increase of cultivation from the spread of the taste for the drugs. One of the most definite statements of the last class is that of the District Forest Officer, North Malabar, that, "owing to the greater demand for ganja from the coast, cultivation as described above is slightly increasing year by year." Another witness states that in Ganjam the cultivation is increasing in the Agency tracts while it is declining in the plains. Reference may be made to another specimen of the arguments to shew increase. After quoting the returns of cultivation in the Bapatla taluk, which show steady decrease, as the only ones available, the Acting Sub-Collector at Guntoor writes: "As far as Baposia taluk is concerned, the figures given above seem to indicate that the area under hemp cultivation is gradually decreasing. But I am inclined to think that these figures are not reliable." And, after alluding to the introduction of excise arrangements and increase of revenue, he proceeds: "This shows that there is a possibility of large future developments in the trade in hemp drugs, and the hypothesis that the cultivated area is gradually decreasing must neces- sarily be wrong." Being ignorant of the method of keeping agricultural statisticsin the Madras Presidency, the Commission are unable to judge how far the Sub- Collector is justified in mistrusting the figures he quotes. That some ground exists is shown by the admission of the Secretary to the Board of Revenue quoted above. But, taking this for granted, the arguments cannot be accepted, for there are other sources of ganja supply besides the Kistna district, and the expansion of the revenue does not necessarily imply an increase of production or even of consumption. The extent of home cultivation. 123. There is not after all any great body of evidence to show increase of cultivation, and the increase indicated is not very decided, except perhaps in the case of Angappa Gonuden (189), who says: "Hitherto cultivation of the ganja plant was very rare. But it has now considerably increased, since more people resort to its use now than before." This witness is worth quoting, because his answers are generally sensible, and he appears to be in the habit of culti- vating the plant himself. But it is advisable to guard against an apparent tendency to exaggeration. His description of the extent of cultivation in Salem may be quoted here with the above reservation as probably typical of several localities in the Presidency: "There is little of the ganja plant cultivation in my district of Salem. They are all for the production of ganja alone. One-fourth of the houses in Salem have on an average half a dozen plants in each backyard. The same number of plants can be found in at least 2 per cent. of the fields in the villages of Salem, Ather, and Namakul taluks." In most districts the extent of backyard cultivation falls short of this descrip- tion. In Cuddapah and Coimbatore the state of things would seem to resemble Salem, with the addition that there are probably some small patches of field cultivation grown for profit. In the hill tracts of Ganjam, Vizagapatam, and Godavari, and to a very much less degree in the Wynaad and the Nilgiris, the home cultivation seems to be carried on for the market, the produce being used for barter or sale to licensed dealers. There is no formal restriction on cultivation, and the cultivators are allowed to sell the produce to the licensed
48 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. IV. dealers. The whole of the homestead cultivation must, therefore, be re- garded as entering into the licensed consumption. Looking to the extent of this cultivation throughout the Presidency, and especially in the hill tracts of the north and south, it will not be extravagant to say that the total area in which the hemp plant is cultivated is perhaps double that of the regular field cultiva- tion. Madras States. Sondur, Banganapalle, Pudu- kottai, Travancore, and Cochin. 124. The only cultivation reported is two acres in Banganapalle. But the plant is found uncultivated in Travancore, and there is reason to believe that in this part of India the spon- taneous growth is associated very intimately with cultivation. It may therefore be inferred, in spite of the fact that the drugs are imported, that there is some home cultivation in that State. And from the survey of the whole Presidency, which showed a general prevalence of home culti- vation, it may be presumed that it is to be found in all the States, more commonly in Travancore than elsewhere, owing to the country being more favour- able to the growth on account of a great part of it being hill land. It appears also that in Travancore the Kanekars, a hill tribe, are allowed to grow the drug for their own consumption. Bombay. Extent of regular cultivation. 125. The districts in which the regular cultivation of hemp is now principally carried on are Ahmednagar and Satara, and their acreage for the last eight years is as follows:[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Survey of India Offices, Calcutta, August 1894. A GANJA FIELD, KHANDESH.
CH. IV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 49 and its hemp cultivation has probably been checked by the excise system of the latter province, which underwent important changes about the year mentioned above. Cultivation decreasing. 126. The total cultivation of the Presidency, excluding Sind, for the last eight years is as follows:- Acres. Acres. 1885-86 1,844 1889-90 1,341 1886-87 1,488 1890-91 1,201 1887-88 904 1891-92 1,093 1888-89 533 1892-93 812 One or two witnesses hint rather than indicate specifically the existence of cultivation in the Ahmedabad and Kaira districts of the Guzerat Division and in Thana in the Konkan. But there is certainly no regular field cultivation in these districts. Except about twelve acres in Surat and Broach for the production of what is called bhang, the whole cultivation is practically confined to the Deccan or Central Division. It has been suggested that the excise system of the Central Provinces is to account for the fall of the cultivation in Khandesh from the high acreage of 1885-86, and it may have affected districts at a greater dis- tance from the frontier. But it can hardly be accepted as the explanation of the extraordinarily low figure of 1888-89. The reduction in this year was shared by the four contiguous districts in the southern part of the Central Division and not by the districts of Nasik and Khandesh in the northern part, and was probably due to an unfavourable season. There is no official explanation of it. In the suc- ceeding year cultivation recovered, but has since shown a steady decrease. Wit- nesses state that the irksome conditions imposed by the excise system render the cultivation unpopular, though it is not burdened with any direct tax or license. This may well be the cause of the decrease. Home cultivation is rare. 127. Regarding homestead cultivation, the Collector of Thana writes: "The plant is not cultivated in the Konkan as a field crop, nor even as a market crop in gardens, but it occurs in small numbers in many private gardens, and I have seen specimens that seemed to me to be self-sown, and afterwards taken care of by the garden- ers." This is the only positive evidence of the existence of such cultivation in British territory in the Bombay Presidency, though there are to be found hints that it is carried on to a very small extent in the Ahmednagar and Dharwar districts in the present day, and some definite information that it was formerly practised more widely. It seems certain that the extent of it in British territory is now absolutely insignificant. Native states. The south of the Fresidency. 128. The Bombay Presidency contains a great number of Native States whose lands are intermixed with British territory in a very complicated manner. Sometimes they are constituted into separate political charges, and some are under the poli- tical supervision of Collectors of British districts. In the Southern Maratha Country, Kolhapur with many smaller States forms a political charge covering a very considerable area. The leading State has prohibited the cultivation of hemp, but the following minor States allow it with in some cases the restriction of a 13

The total for the first period is 425 acres as compared with 337 acres for the year 1892-93. There has been a remarkable falling off in recent years in the Karachi district and the Khairpur State, and 350 acres may now be taken as the normal area of cultivation in Sind. The cultivation of isolated plants near houses would appear to be extremely rare. The evidence does not speak of it. Aden. 131. The hemp plant is not cultivated in Aden at all. Berar. 132. The cultivation of the hemp plant was not restricted in Berar until 1875, and in that year a system of granting licenses, subject to a fee of Rs. 8 irrespective of area, was introduced. The system was modified in 1884, when the license fee was raised to Rs. 10 per acre. The total area cultivated since 1877-78 has been52 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. IV.

The Deputy Commissioner of Mergui states that in those days the plant was cultivated in parts of the Tenasserim township, and some other localities in that division of the province. The Deputy Commis- sioner of Pegu also writes that before the prohibition the hemp plant is reported to have been abundantly cultivated in Bassein district, and in small quantities in Pegu. Extent of cultivation in the set- tled districts at the present time. 137. It does not appear that the Burmans proper were ever given to the hemp drugs, and it is not therefore surprising that the more extensive cultivation in Upper Burma should have ceased with that of Lower Burma directly the prohibition was passed and the market in Lower Burma was closed. Some survival of the practice which supplied the shops is, however, indicated in the evidence of Mr. Tarleton, District Superintendent of Police of Thayetmyo (29), who says that "certain villages round Tindau and Thetngaibyin in the Allanmyo Sub-division are in the habit of trading in ganja, which they bring into Allanmyo and Thayetmyo and sell to natives of India." Unfortunately this witness was unable to attend in answer to the invita- tion of the Commission, and they are therefore left in doubt as to the precise value of the statement. Mr. Bridges states that he has frequently noticed in the diaries of excise officers in Upper Burma references to the cultivation of ganja; and again54 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. IV. is smuggled into Burma. In the Upper Chindwin district there is a small amount of secret cultivation. Mysore. 139. In the civil and military station of Bangalore the cultivation of the hemp plant is prohibited, and in the last seven years there have been two or three prosecutions for breach of the regulation. There can be no cultivation except a stray plant here and there. The Mysore laws provide that hemp may be cultivated under license. Cultivators appear to have made two or three unsuccessful experiments, and to have abandoned the idea of growing the plant as a regular crop. This informa- tion is furnished in the memorandum of the Excise Commissioner. Mr. McDon- nell, the Special Assistant Excise Commissioner, who seems to have made a study of the whole subject of the hemp drugs, describes the method by which a superior quality of ganja is produced locally, and he thinks that its great value in the market as compared with imported ganja must be a strong induce- ment to clandestine cultivation in yards and gardens. He is evidently of opinion that this is not at all unfrequent, especially in towns and large villages where concealment is more easy. He is corroborated in some degree by other informa- tion. The Excise Assistant Supervisor, Tumkur district, says, however, that the hemp plant "is cultivated for the production of ganja, but to a very small extent, all over the province. The extent of cultivation has considerably decreased since the introduction of the rules...............for regulating and restricting the cultiva- tion, possession, sale, import, and export of ganja;" and this must be clandestine cultivation, for it seems certain that no licenses have been taken out. The Sub-divisional Officer, Chick Ballapur, says: "The local cultivation and pre- paration of ganja are at present confined to the Chintamony taluk." On the whole, however, it would appear that the cultivation is inconsiderable, and the local production quite insignificant. Hyderabad. 140. The official memorandum of the Hyderabad State reports that no license is required for cultivation, but it is understood that the produce must be sold to the farmer of the monopoly. Only enough is grown for local wants: the cultivators are few because special knowledge and skill are required for the cultivation. No statis- tics are supplied. The Director of Agriculture and Commerce states that the land under ganja in the whole dominion may be roughly estimated at about 300 or 400 acres. The cultivation is carried on in a small tract imme- diately south of Hyderabad and in the Aurangabad and Nandair districts, which lie on the north bordering Khandesh and Berar. By another informant the Indore district lying between Nandair and Hyderabad is mentioned, and another states that in Mahratwada and the Canarese districts, which latter must lie on the south and south-west of the dominion, it is grown to about the same extent as tobacco. The information gives the impression that only small plots are sown by each man. Besides this regular cultivation, a few plants may occasion- ally be reared in yards and gardens, but the produce from unskilful cultivation is said to be very inferior. About 350 acres may be taken as a fair figure for the whole State. One informant speaks of fluctuation in the extent of cultiva- tion, and attributes a slight increase to the class of fakirs and gosains becoming more numerous.

In Dholpur permission is required to cultivate, and it appears that no one asks for it, and that there is consequently no cultivation. In all the other States cultivation for the production of bhang only is reported. Only five States furnish figures from which to judge of its extent56 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH.

No narcotic hemp is cultivated either for the production of charas or its flowers or seeds." The area is about 10 to 12 bighas. It is also found in the compounds of sadhus, fakirs, and other people who consume ganja or bhang. There is no reason to suppose that this latter kind of cultivation is very common. Kashmir. 148. The Governor of Kashmir and Jammu and the Member of Kashmir State Council report that the plant is not cultivated. It appears that the wild growth is abundant enough, and develops the narcotic properties in sufficient degree to satisfy the wants of the people. Nepal. 149. The answers to questions received from the Nepal State through the Resident, while alleging that no one cultivates ganja, describe how the wild plant is nurtured and treated, sometimes, it would appear, after being transplanted. This treatment is said to require special skill (questions 2 and 10), and the inference is that the industry is not followed by any large number of persons. The Bengal evid- ence shows that Nepal charas used formerly to be consumed in that prov- ince, but has now given way to that from the Punjab. But it is reported from the North-Western Provinces that 25 to 50 maunds are still imported into Lucknow. It would seem, therefore, that the industry is not inconsiderable. In Royle's Fibrous Plants of India will be found quoted a report from Mr. Hodgson, which shows that in the northern districts of Nepal the plant is pretty extensively grown for fibre. Summary. 150. The following table shows the total area of hemp cultivation in India as far as it has been possible to state definite figures:58 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. IV. The only cultivation of any moment which has been omitted is that of those States in Rajputana and Central India which have not been mentioned in the table, and the irregular kind of cultivation which is carried on in the Madras Presidency, the Garhjat States of Bengal, and the plains of the North-Western Provinces. There is also a considerable area of fibre cultivation in the Native States and British territory in the Himalayas which has not been taken into account, and probably amounts to some hundreds of acres. Deducting the fibre cultivation, which yields but little of the drugs, from the total area given in the table, and making allowance for the narcotic cultivation which has been omitted, the total area of cultivation in India for the drugs can hardly exceed 6,000 acres. The total Himalayan cultivation for fibre of the Punjab and North-Western Provinces in the region extending from the borders of Nepal to those of Kashmir may be taken on a liberal estimate at nearly double that of Kumaon and British Garhwal, or 1,500 acres. It cannot be said that the regular cultivation either of the mountains or the plains is shown to be increasing or decreasing. In British territory the desultory kind of cultivation has either been suppressed, as in Bengal, Assam, the Central Provinces, and Berar, or has disappeared, as in Bombay, or is being abandoned as in Madras, the North- Western Provinces, and the Punjab.
CHAPTER V. METHODS OF CULTIVATION AND MATTERS CONNECTED THEREWITH. Definition of the narcotic products of the hemp plant. 151. Before describing the cultivation of the hemp plant, it will be proper to mention the products which are got from it. It has been shown that the plant which yields the true hemp fibre is the same as that which produces the narcotics. The seed is the familiar hemp seed which is given to cage birds. It is also occasionally eaten by the natives of India, especially in the Himalayas, and an useful oil is expressed from it. The fibre and seeds only come incidentally within the scope of the pre- sent inquiry. The narcotic products of the plant are ganja, charas, and bhang. Dr. Prain has described very fully the physiological processes by which the narcotic principle is secreted in the various parts of the plant. For the purposes of the Commission it is sufficient to state plainly and briefly what the three articles are in the simple forms in which they first enter the market. The definitions with which the Commission's list of questions is introduced are as follows. They are borrowed from Dr. Prain:60 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. V. lost. Bhang is cultivated in Sind with similar precautions to prevent the fertilization of the female plant as in Bengal, and the product is called nothing but bhang, and is rarely used for anything but concocting drink and sweetmeats, the smoking ganja being imported. Bhang is the ancient name of the plant. It is also the name of the form of narcotic product which was earliest discovered, for it must have taken time to learn the art of isolating the female plant and so producing ganja. Bhang is also the name of the most simple style of consumption, viz., by pounding and drinking, which must have preceded smoking. Naturally, there- fore, bhang is a more comprehensive term than ganja, and often includes it, especially where the production of ganja has not become a recognised industry. In the Madras Presidency ganja is the more general term, so much so that in some places the word bhang is hardly understood. This is probably due to the hemp plant being only known to the people as cultivated for the production of ganja. Charas is not always the simple resin. 154. Charas may not always be the pure resinous matter. It generally con- tains leaf dust and other impurities picked up in the process of manufacture. But it is hardly ever con- founded with ganja or bhang. Its appearance, that of dark green or brown paste, is distinct from that of both the other drugs. In Kashmir and the Punjab only is the name ganja sometimes applied to charas, probably because charas is pre- pared from the female or ganja plant (Governor of Kashmir). There is reason to think that in some parts of Rajputana the distinction between charas and ganja is not very strictly observed, and that the former name is occasionally given to the latter drug. Bengal. 155. In Bengal the hemp plant is grown solely for the production of ganja in the area of regular and licensed cultivation. The illicit cultivation which is to be found in insignifi- cant quantity all over the province, and the character of which has been described, yields for the most part bhang and not ganja fit for smoking. Ganja of inferior quality is produced in the Tributary States of Orissa in considerable quantity. In the Tributary States of the Chota Nagpur Division ganja of the same quality is produced, but in less quantity. The cultivated product of Hill Tippera appears to be still lower in the scale as regards quality, and very little in quantity. It is proposed now to describe the skilled cultivation of the Ganja Mahal, where the agricultural processes for the growth and pre- paration of ganja have undoubtedly been brought to greater perfection than in any other part of India, and, as far as information will allow, the more homely prac- tices prevailing outside that tract. Babu Hem Chunder Kerr's report contains a detailed account of the Rajshahi cultivation; Dr. Prain has given a brief out- line of the mode of culture; and Mr. Price, Collector of the district of Rajshahi, has submitted a sketch of the cultivators' business during each month of the year. Babu Hem Chunder Kerr's report is the basis of the information furnished by most witnesses. Endeavour will be made to compile a succinct account from these materials. Regular cultivation of the Ganja Mahal: Preparation of the field. 156. Hemp is an exhausting crop, and requires a light, well-drained soil. It appears that there is but a limited quantity of thoroughly suitable ground in the Ganja Mahal, and that there is a tendency to abandon the outlying lands and concentrate the
CH. V.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 61 cultivation about Naogaon. The ganja plant is reared in a seed bed or nursery and planted out into the field. The field is selected between January and the middle of March, and must be one which has lain fallow, or has borne nothing but light crops, such as pulses or mustard, during the two previous years. It must not be overshadowed by trees. It is first ploughed to remove weeds and stubble as thoroughly as the cultivators' means will allow. In April and May the field is liberally dressed with fresh surface earth from surrounding lands, the quantity used depending on the quality of the field. The turf and weeds on the sides of the field are next dug up in clods and thrown on to the field, the holes thus made being filled up with earth from the ditches. The field is thus cleaned to its extreme boundaries, and the weeds utilised as dressing for the land. In this process a small bank about nine inches high is raised round the field. The fresh earth added to the field becomes desiccated in a week or so, and then cow-dung manure is added and the field well ploughed again. From this time till September ploughing, followed by harrowing with the bamboo ladder, is carried out from time to time, the belief being, as Babu Hem Chunder Kerr says, that the oftener the land is ploughed the better is the crop. A channel is made to keep the field well drained. The nursery conditions requisite to the germination of seed and growth of seedlings. 157. The details given by Babu Hem Chunder Kerr regarding the selection of the seed bed have special interest in connection with the subject of the spontaneous growth. He writes: "A plot of land near the homestead of the cultivator is generally made available for a nursery, and the people in order to make themselves sure of its dryness always make a point of using those lands only in which a tuberous-rooted, grass-like vegetable called matha (Cyperus rotundus,L.) grows. The growth of matha is, in their opinion, a sure sign of the land being quite dry." In another place Babu Hem Chunder Kerr says: "The nursery or seed bed consists of a plot of high, light, sandy loam." The selection of this plot is made in May, and as soon as one or two showers have fallen it is ploughed. The ploughing is repeated three or four times each month till August. The object is complete pulverisation of the soil, and, if necessary, the bamboo ladder in addition to the plough is passed over the land for this purpose. Manure is not used, and the land must be quite free of shade of any kind. The seeds are sown broadcast on a fine day after a ploughing, and the sowing is followed by harrowing to cover the seed. The bed is carefully drained. The following remarks from Babu Hem Chunder Kerr's report are quoted to show certain idiosyncrasies of the plant for the same reason that the previous verbatim extracts were made: "Seeds are not sown on either a rainy or even a cloudy day when rain is apprehended, as the wet ground rots them. Even if it rains three or four days after the seeds have been sown, most of the seeds are destroyed, as the earth gets hardened into a cake after the rain, and the germs cannot force their way through it. In such a case fresh seed has to be sown in another nursery again............ Nor is the grass weeded out at any time after the sowing of the seeds. They are also never irrigated. The cultivators are of opinion that the growth of grass in the seed beds is beneficial to the young plants, inasmuch as it protects the latter from the action of the wind.". Transplanting. 158. Towards the end of August or beginning of September the field is again dressed with cow-dung, refuse, and house-sweepings. About a week or ten days after this comes the day 16
62 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. V. for planting out. The field is ploughed and harrowed, and made into ridges "well smoothed and beaten down with the hand," and the seedlings are planted out. All this is done on the one day for fear that the soil which has been so thoroughly pulverised should get too dry. The seedlings prefer high and dry soil. 159. It is necessary to again quote verbatim from Babu Hem Chunder Kerr for the same reason as before: "The number of plough- ings is regulated by the nature of the soil, khear or clayey lands, in which hemp is occasionally, grown, requiring more frequent ploughing than fields of poli soil or light, sandy loam, which form the majority of the ganja beds. The seedlings at the time of transplantation are from four to five weeks old and from six to twelve inches high. The smaller ones are collected for higher and drier fields, in which they are enabled to throw out their roots much quicker and easier, and grow up much faster than in low fields, the soil of which is somewhat heavy owing to the existence in it of a greater amount of moisture, which retards the growth of very tender plants................ If rain falls within three or four days after the transplantation, it proves injurious to the young plants, the roots of which, not having taken any hold upon the soil, rot and die away." Treatment of crop between plant- ing out and removal of the males. 160. The operations of the next few weeks are thus described by Dr. Prain: "A month or so after transplantation, about the middle of October, the fields are carefully weeded; a fortnight later, beginning of November, the ridges are hoed down as far as is possible without injuring the roots of the hemp, which are then well manured with oil-cake, or a mixture of cake and cow-dung, and the ridges rebuilt over the manure. About the middle of November the plants are trimmed by the removal of the lower branches; this helps to give the plant the pyramidal shape that ensures the flowering tops being as close together as possi- ble, obviates the formation of ganja close to the ground, where it would certainly get covered with sand and mud, and finally admits of another course of ploughing and harrowing with a narrow ladder between the ridges; this course immediately follows the trimming, and is itself followed by a second course of manuring with powdered cow-dung and oil-cake, after which the ridges are again rebuilt." The elimination of the males. 161. At about this stage the detection and removal of the male plants is begun. An expert is required for the work, either the professional poddar or parakhdar or the cultivator himself if he has acquired the necessary skill in distinguishing the male from the female plants. The exact differences by which the plants are distinguished by the experts cannot be described with confidence. The operation takes place before the flowers are developed; and Babu Hem Chunder Kerr says that the inspection is invariably made in the morning so as to have a good light, which shows how fine these differences must be. The poddar breaks over the plants which he decides to be male, the cultivator plucks them out, and fills the blank spaces with plants from the parts of the field where they are left in greater number. Then follows the first irrigation, which is regulated so as to moisten the ridges, but leave no water standing in the furrows. The poddar's visit may be repeated two or three times, and the field may be irrigated from three to six times in the following few

CH. V.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 63 weeks. The cultivator himself is always on the look-out to detect and remove male plants which may have been overlooked at the regular inspections. Between the first and second irrigations the ridges are hoed and the field manured a third time. Maturing of the crop and detec- tion of abnormal females. 162. Babu Hem Chunder Kerr states that the male plant begins to flower in November and the female plant in the beginning of January, and Dr. Prain adds that from the time the latter flowering begins "the cultivator is on the outlook for those abnormal male flowers on his female plants which the poddar could not possibly have foretold." The ganja begins to ripen about the middle of February, "the state of maturity being indicated by a brownish appearance and the falling off of all the larger leaves." The Commission visited Naogaon on the 16th February, when the harvest was in full swing. The Bengal cultivator misnames the sexes. The khasia plant not discovered outside Bengal. The Bengal cultivator does not grow a seed-crop. 163. There are one or two matters in which the ways of the Bengal cultivator are different from those of the people of other prov- inces. They talk of the ganja-bearing plant as the male and the pollen-bearing plant as the female. In the Central Provinces and the west of India the cultivator seems to have learnt more of the principles of fruc- tification in plants, and generally calls them by their true sexes. The existence of the khasia (emasculated) plant, which Babu Hem Chunder Kerr calls hermaphrodite, and Dr. Prain describes as "functionally defective," "useless but innocent," and "collated, as its name implies, with the sex to which it really belongs," has apparently no parallel at Khandwa in the Central Provinces. The plant is left standing at harvest, or rejected from the heap if it has been gathered by mistake. The Bengal cul- tivator does not grow a crop specially for seed as is done at Khandwa. He uses the grains that fall from his ganja in the processes of manufacture, which are very numerous, notwith- standing all the pains that have been taken to eradicate the male plants. Cultivation not confined to any class. 164. The cultivation of hemp in the Ganja Mahal is a practice that is handed down from father to son in common with so many arts and industries in this country. Beyond this the industry cannot be said to be confined to a class. Musalmans very largely preponderate among the cultivators in about the proportion of 7 to 2 according to Mr. Price. There is no evidence that the occupation is held in contempt, a point which Dr. Prain has discussed at pages 47 and 48 of his report. Babu Hem Chunder Kerr entered fully into the details of cost of cultivation and the profits of the cultivator. He estimated the former at Rs. 50 to Rs. 60 and the latter at Rs. 25 to Rs. 50 per bigha. There is no equally good information of more recent date. Ganja ranks as one of the superior crops. Rain damages the crop when it is maturing. 165. Babu Hem Chunder Kerr notices a fact which appears repeatedly in the evidence from all provinces that "when the plants begin to flower in clusters and the resinous matter is formed, rain spoils the ganja." The quantity and superiority of Central Asian charas is said to be due to the dryness of the climate in that region. This is a point of considerable interest as a possible explanation of the inferiority of the drug when cultivated in the rainy season. There is no evidence of cultivation
64 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. V. in the Darjeeling district for fibre. From the evidence relating to other parts of the Himalayas, it is improbable that such cultivation does not exist. Irregular cultivation. It may yield ganja, but probably does not often do so. 166. Though there is not any great amount of illicit cultivation, it will be interesting to note the information furnished by re- ports and evidence as to the methods employed in it. Mr. Basu, Assistant to the Director of Land Records and Agriculture, reports that he observed signs of the spontaneous growth where it was not plentiful being looked after with some degree of care. Talking of Bhagalpur and Purnea, he says: "As a rule the people of these districts could not distinguish between male and female plants, the leaves of both being used as a bhang; but one man pointed out to me a plant which was a female, and said that this class of plants produced the best drug. It is not uncommon to see a few selected plants, mostly females, left on the ground; these acquire a more bushy appearance not unlike that of the ganja-bearing plant. All this made me suspect that the people knew a great deal more about the bhang plant than they were willing to avow." This would lead to the belief that the secret cultivator not unfrequently succeeds in producing smokable ganja. An Excise Deputy Collector describes one method by which the plant is not only concealed from view, but which may result in effectually secluding the female plant. When the plant is a foot high, an inverted earthen pot is placed over it supported by pegs fixed in the ground. The confined growth takes the form of a cabbage-flower (sic), and would in all probability retain the resin in more than common quantity. A Burmese witness has described a similar method as being the regular practice in the Shan States. The Registrar of Calcutta (98), enquiring from fakirs and religious mendicants, learns that the wild plant is made to produce ganja for smoking by lightly rolling the flower spikes of the growing plants between the hands, thereby causing the component parts of the spike to stick together, and preventing the access of the pollen. "This treatment, repeated several times, converts the spikes into what is commonly called jata, which gives the matted appearance to the article." Witness (53) states that he has seen ganja plants cultivated illicitly from the twigs of which ganja as good in appearance as excise ganja can be prepared, but the flavour of it is alleged to be inferior. There is not in the evidence, however, any general confirmation of the supposition that the illicit cultivation produces the stronger form of the drug. The matter will be further examined in dealing with the preparation of the drugs. There are not, however, sufficient grounds for supposing that the homestead cultivation or the fostering of the wild plant is carried on on any extensive scale. It is not often that either practice produces anything superior to bhang, and where there is an unlimited quantity of good bhang growing wild, there can be little inducement to illicit cultivation with its attendant risks. No information has been given of occupants ever being paid for allowing the bhang growing on their lands to be collected, and that incentive to fostering the plant appears to be wanting. It will be seen also that where the wild plant does not prevail, the licit consumption of ganja is comparatively small, and the consumers are therefore few. Tributary Mahals. 167. The Tributary States of Orissa after the Ganja Mahal contain the most extensive and important cultivation in the Province of Bengal. This cultivation has never been made

It appears to be of the home- stead sort, and limited to a few plants in each plot. The only suggestion offered that it is sometimes conducted on a larger scale comes from the Sub-divisional Officer of Jajpur in Cuttack (52), who says: "If the lands be small, the seeds are sown broadcast; if the lands be large, the seeds are first sown in a nursery plot." Mr. Wylly, Government Agent at Keonjhar, states that the plant is grown in seed beds in April and May and transplanted, which may be regarded as some confirmation of the above witness. If this fact is accepted, the evidence shows that the plants are raised in three ways66 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. V. Mutilation of the female plant. plants on which flowers grow are destroyed, and those on which the leaves become intertwined are preserved. The latter description clearly indicates the clustered spike of the female plant. Gangpur reports that the male plants (really female) which produce flowers and fruit are not destroyed, which may well imply that the others are. It may be inferred generally that the practice is not well established or systematically carried out. It is probably in the empirical stage described by Dr. Prain (page 12), and directed to the removal of a plant which is useless rather than mischievous; for Bonai says: "No one can distinguish which is the male or female plant." The answers show also that the male plant is very generally pre- served for use as bhang, while the one with intertwined leaves is kept for ganja. The ground is ploughed and dressed, but not apparently treated in any special manner. The splitting of the stem with insertion of a potsherd and the twisting of the plants are practised; but it would appear from the Udaipur answer that the twisting is merely the means of splitting the stem. It is reported from Gangpur that cross incisions are made in the stem with a knife, and "something like opium or other intoxicating thing is put into it, and the interstice is then closed up with earth to increase the power of intoxication." It may be concluded that the method of cultivation does not differ from that in vogue in the Garhjat States. Hill Tippera. 169. No description is furnished of the cultivation in Hill Tippera, but a well informed witness classes it with that of the Garhjat States. It is not likely that it is more skilful or elaborate. Kuch Behar. 170. There is no regular cultivation in Kuch Behar, and the homestead cultiva- tion, if there is any, cannot be different from that of the surrounding British territory. Assam. 171. There is no regular cultivation in Assam, and the evidence gives no in- formation about the processes employed in the illicit and hill cultivation. Mr. Anderson states that the Miris of Lakhimpur hedge in the wild growth; Mr. Godfrey that the plant is weeded. The cultivators named are, besides the Miris of Lakhimpur, the Nagas of the Sibsagar frontier. Mr. Spicer mentions Kukis, Patnies, and a few coolies, and his evidence relates to the Cachar Valley. The hill tribes of the province and its frontiers may be included in the list, and the coolies gene- rally. The drugs produced are bhang and very inferior ganja. The two things are practically the same. North-Western Provinces. 172. There are three classes of cultivation in this provinceCH. V.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 67 and the soil must be light. Early in June the field is cleaned of all rubbish which is burnt upon it. It is ploughed immediately after a good downfall of rain. In the beginning of July the seed is sown; and this must be done on a fine day, for the seed will not grow if sown in the wet. Chaff is then scattered over the field to protect the seed from the birds. In eight days the seed germin- ates, and fifteen days afterwards the crop is carefully hoed so that the plants are not injured. After another fortnight the field is weeded a second time. No other operation is described till September (Bhado), when the plants have grown up, and some have begun to bear seed. These are called "sujango." or "kalango" (according to Duthie "gul bhang"), and are the female plants. Some do not bear seed, and are called "phulango" (according to Duthie "phulbhang"), and they are the male plants. These latter are plucked up and laid in the sun for a few days to dry, and are then manufactured into fibre. The fibre from the male plant is superior. The female plants have meantime been growing up to a height of some ten feet, of which the upper third is full of leaf and seed. In (Kartik) November the female plants are cut down from the root, and spread in the sun for twenty-four hours to dry. The charas is then got from the plants by rubbing the heads between the hands. This description gives the female plant a life from germination to harvest of little more than four months. Duthie and Fuller put the sowing in May, and this gives a longer life, more nearly approaching the period of growth, about six or seven months, in the ganja tract of Bengal. The latter is probably the more correct. Class of cultivators: Cultivation is not reputable. 174. Duthie and Fuller write that hemp growing is restricted to the lowest classes of cultivators, being considered beneath the dignity of the higher castes. So much is this the case that the phrase "May hemp be sown in thy house" is one of the commonest of abusive imprecations. Mr. Dharma Nand and other witnesses corroborate this account. The principal cultivators appear to be the Khasias or Tabhilas, a class of people above the Domes and below Rajputs in the social scale, who do not wear the sacred thread. If a Brahman or Rajput wishes to cultivate hemp, he engages a Khasia or Dome to work for him; but, after the crop is taken off, he has no prejudice against making charas or separating the fibres from the stalks. Dr. Prain (page 48) has traced the contempt in which the hemp cultivator is held to the original motive of the cultivation, viz., the production of fibre, and points out that the cultivators of other fibres, such as sann (Crotalaria), are simi- larly regarded. Mr. Cockburn (34) confirms this explanation, suggesting that the offensiveness of the operation of rotting the stalks is the origin of the dislike. Unfortunately Mr. Dharma Nand from direct knowledge contradicts this, which might have been a reasonable solution of the question; for he says that the higher classes have no objection to this operation. The origin of the prejudice is prob- ably to be sought in very early social institutions. The seeds are, next after the fibre, the important part of the products of Himalayan cultivation. They are eaten, and yield oil. The seed of the unculti- vated plant is very inferior in size, and is not therefore used for sowing. The regular cultivation of bhang. 175. There is very little information about the methods employed in the regular cultivation of bhang in the districts of Farakhabad and Hardoi. The crop must be grown in fairly large plots or fields, for it is capable of being measured, and the Agricultural Depart- ment apparently keeps a record of the area. The seed would seem to be sown at
68 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. V. the same season as wheat and barley, and mixed in patches with these crops. It is harvested in May after the other crops have been taken off the ground. There is no evidence of the male plant being eradicated. Secret cultivation. 176. The homestead or desultory cultivation for the production of ganja seems to be carried on for the most part secretly. Mr. Bruce of Ghazipur, referring to his own district of course, states that the cultivation is not carried on openly, and it is therefore difficult to obtain any particulars about it; that the seed is sown broadcast in good soil, and the plants afterwards moved to some enclosed place, such as the courtyard of a house, and carefully tended; and that the female plants are used for ganja. Regarding the practice of eradicating the male plant, the evidence is not de- cisive, and what there is refers sometimes to the tending of wild growth, and sometimes to the more methodical cultivation. Thus Mr. Ferrard, Magistrate and Collector of Banda, referring to the spontaneous growth on the Gumti river, says that, in spite of close police supervision, "the people continue to keep some plants and leaves, and prepare drugs from them. In such cases the male and female plants are kept separate." He may be talking in this place of the drugs and not the growing plants, for he says further that he has been told that "the male plants are cut down when young and dried, and its leaves form bhang. Ganja is made from the female flower and petals when almost ripe. The plants can grow together until the period of fertilisation." Witness (48) has been told that the male plants are extirpated. On the other hand, the drug contractor of Moradabad (248) had never heard of the male plant being extirpated. Cultivation for ganja in former days. 177. The information regarding bygone cultivation throws some light on the knowledge of the people and the practice in respect of the removal of the male plant. Witness (61) states that there was a good deal of cultivation formerly at Loohaisar, tahsil Fatehpur, in Barabanki, but it was forbidden. Witness (249), referring to the same cultivation, seems to say that it was grown in a tract called Mahadeva, and this must have yielded the ganja which other witnesses speak of as Mahadeva. Witness (61) gives some details of the methods then employed. The seed used to be sown with wheat and other crops, and when the plants had attained a little growth, the Kabariyas, and they only, were able to distinguish which were ganja and which bhang plants, i.e., female and male respectively. The ganja plants were then transplanted to some suitable spot. He mentions also the practice of twisting the leaves (sic) to make the plant produce ganja. Principal features of irregular cul- tivation. 178. It is not worth while discussing the evidence of individual witnesses further. It may be inferred from the whole that the distinction between the male and female plants is pretty widely known; that where the spontaneous growth is in small and manage- able quantity, and where plants have been sown in suitable places, or transplant- ed into such places, the female plants often receive special care and have the males removed from among them; and that for the more desultory sort of cultiva- tion it is not very material whether the seed is taken from the cultivated or wild growth, from ganja or from bhang. Tehri Garhwal and Rampur. 179. There is no information of any methods in vogue in the States of Tehri Garhwal and Rampur different from those of the province generally.
CH. V.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 69 Punjab. Himalayan cultivation. 180. There is more or less evidence of cultivation of the hemp plant all over the Himalayan portion of the province, including the smaller Native States. The cultivation is in small patches. A report from Kulu in 1880 says: "Almost every house has a small patch near it, a long strip beside a hedge, or a small bed a few square yards long (sic) in area." The only other detail of cultivation furnished is that the season of growth is from April and May to October and November. It may be safely assumed that the method of cultivation does not materially differ from that prac- tised in Kumaon, which has been fully described. Whether charas is produced to the same extent may be open to doubt, but the information on the point is defective. Cultivation in the plains for bhang. 181. Though the extent of cultivation in the Punjab plains is not great, the details of the methods employed in it, which can be gathered from the evidence and papers, may be noted. A memorandum by Hari Chand, Assistant to the Commissioner of Excise, states that "people grow it in both harvests in the months of March and November. They cut plants for use in February and June." The latter named months appear to relate to the period within which the plant is gathered if it is sown with the late or rabbi crops. An account of the cultivation is furnished in the appendix of Mr. James Wilson's evidence as having been given him by his Excise Assistant, Mr. Kirthee Singh. The plant is reared for bhang only, never for ganja, and charas is not extracted except rarely for private consumption. The land is usually close to the village, and of the description called niain, the same as that described by Duthie and Fuller, when speaking of the Himalayan cultivation, which the daily offices of the vil- lagers provide with a plentiful supply of manure. It is ploughed frequently in August and September, the seed is sown broadcast in the latter month, and the field is watered. The watering is repeated three or four times, and the crop is hoed now and then and kept clear of weeds. The crop is ready to cut in March and April. No distinction is made between male and female plants. The whole is cut and dried together, and the leaves, flowers, and small twigs are then shaken out and form bhang. The outturn is eight to ten maunds a bigha. A little charas is sometimes made by beating the flowering twigs over a piece of cloth laid on the ground. A greyish white powder falls on the cloth which is collected and dried. A few details of the method of cultivation. 182. This account gives only one season of cultivation, but there are witnesses to corroborate the Assistant to the Commissioner of Excise as to the plants being grown with both the early and late crops, and other fragmentary information is furnished as to the pro- cesses employed. Witness (68) mentions the use of goat and sheep dung, and the advantage of sowing four or five seeds together when the plant is to be grown amongst tobacco or garden crops. This would be cold weather cultivation. He also mentions the broadcast sowing, and states that the product of the plants grown in sailaba lands is more intoxicating. Witness (26) states distinctly that there are two seasons for the cultivation, from Kartik to Chait (October- November to April-May), and Baisakh to Sawan (May to August); and he men- tions two curious manures, the "excreta of a serpent" and "decayed swallow- wort." The cultivation is carried on in small plots, and only by the keepers of 18
70 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. V. takyas and dharamsalas, especially by Sikhs. Witness (74) states that trans- planting is practised, and that the cultivators are the fakirs and keepers of dharam- salas and consumers generally. Witness (67) gives three seasons for cultivation, probably the times of sowing, October-November, February-March, and July- August, and states that the plant is sometimes manured after it has grown a foot or two high. Witness (19) gives the season of sowing as from October to January and the harvest time as March, and states that the crop is cultivated like other chahi-hatri crops on chahi, hatri, or sailaba lands. The crop is cut at night to prevent the loss of seed that would otherwise occur. But this witness has not seen the cultivation. Witness (36), Civil Surgeon of Jhang, a native gentleman, has made direct enquiries in his district. The male plant is, he says, extirpated in February and March, and the rest are gathered in April, the cultivators are of the ordinary class, but are in the employ of the fakir consumers, for whom they grow the drug. Witness (24), Excise Officer, states that the seed is sown in November at the same time as wheat. The field is well drained, cleaned, and manured. The bhang seed is soaked in cow's milk and water the night before sowing. It is sown broadcast. The crop is watered. In March-April the male plant called kera, which is smaller than the female and bears a flowery head, is eradicated. The female plants are cut with the wheat in May. The cultivators are for the most part fakirs, Hindus and Muhammadans, and the products are bhang and ganja. Mr. Dames (9), Deputy Commissioner of Dera Ghazi Khan, states that the land is well watered before sowing between the months of June and September. The seed is sown between October and January, and the crop gathered in March and the beginning of April. Frequent waterings are required, and the crop must be gathered in at night, or it looses much of its value. It may be concluded that the crop is generally grown in the rabbi season, though occasionally in the monsoon; that it requires high tilth, including a liberal supply of manure and irrigation; that transplantation and the extirpation of the male plant are sometimes practised; that the cultivation is for the most part carried on by consumers, of whom a very large proportion are fakirs and religious characters. Punjab States. 183. The evidence from the Punjab States supplies nothing new regarding the cultivation. From Bahawalpur there is corroboration of Mr. Dames's statement that in the processes pre- ceding the sowing of the seed the land is watered. Central Provinces. 184.

CH. V.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 71 The first two are the best; the last is too stiff if the season happens to be very wet. The seed is specially cultivated in fields apart from the ganja, and in this the practice differs from that of Bengal, where the seeds which fall from the ganja in the process of preparation are kept for sowing. The seed of Dhakalgaon, a village in Indore territory, is considered the best, and fetches double the price of other seed. It gives a stouter and more branching plant than the local seed. The same fields are used year after year for hemp cultivation, and it is thought sufficient to manure heavily once in three years. Here again the practice differs essentially from that of Bengal, where the land will only grow hemp every three years, and heavy manuring is required each time it is sown. The manure used in Khandwa consists of household refuse, cow-dung, and ashes, and is given to the land at the rate of sixteen to twenty cartloads per acre. The crop is sown about fifteen days after the first good fall of the south-west monsoon, i.e., in June or July. If the field is not under any crop, it is ploughed in January or February, and in any circumstances it is thoroughly worked up in April or May. The latter is the season for manuring if it is the turn of the field to be manured, and two ploughings and two applications of the bakhar72 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. V. The female plant with abnormal male blossoms. 187. The Commission inspected some fields in this month, and found that those in which the crop was pure ganja contained a number of plants which the cultivators called by the name of moria. These had generally at the ends of the branchlets composing the spikes one or two male blossoms. They are said to be deficient, though not wanting in resin. They are therefore regarded as inferior, but the Khandwa cultivator does not appear to recognise the mischief that they do in the ganja crop. He, however, attributes to them a specially noxious character in that their seed invariably produces plants of the same kind (moria). They are there- fore ruthlessly eliminated from the seed field, while they are sometimes allowed to remain, as was seen, in the ganja field, and are in that case harvested with the good ganja (mal). These appear to be the plants referred to by Dr. Prain as those which "the poddar could not possibly have foretold," and which the Bengal cultivator roots out for himself after the poddar's visits have ceased. They do not appear to be, as Mr. Drake-Brockman supposes, the k hasia plant of Bengal, but it is possible that the latter is included in them. The khasia form of the plant is not recognised by the Khandwa cultivator. The seed crop. 188. The processes in cultivating the seed plant seem to be the same as those above described as regards preference of soil, manur- ing, and tilth. It may be mentioned, however, that irrigation is not invariably practised for either ganja or seed crops. In the case of the seed crop, plants bearing flowers of both sexes are as far as possible eliminated. The process is rational. The blameless female is the more likely to reproduce her own kind. The evidence gives no information of peculiar methods followed in the homestead cultivation. There is no special class of cultivators. Tributary States. 189. There is no information of the methods of cultivation, if any still exists, in the Tributary States. Madras. 190. Mr. Benson's bulletin describes in detail the methods of cultivation in the two regions where alone ganja is supposed to be regularly cultivated in the Madras Presidency. The methods differ, and it is necessary to deal with them separately. Regular cultivation in North Arcct. 191. In the Javadi Hills of the North Arcot district the cultivation is carried on by the Malayalis. These people "claim to alone possess the knowledge necessary for the manufac- ture of ganja, a practice which has been carried on, they state, in these hills from time immemorial." There being no considerable level areas, though the ground is to a certain extent terraced, the crop is sown in small plots. "The soil is free, friable, and open, derived directly from the rocks on which it rests, thoroughly well drained, and appears to be fairly fertile." It grows the ordinary dry food-grains of the country, and the hemp alternates with them. A heavy dressing of cattle dung is absolutely necessary, and this is given in May or June before the rains begin. When the ground has been sufficiently moistened to allow of ploughing, it is broken up, and the ploughing is repeated three or four times until July. The seed is then sown in furrows, opened with the plough three feet apart, and covered in with the feet. The seeds germinate in about a week, and are allowed to grow for three weeks, when they are thinned out. In

There is some discrepancy as to the nature of the soil which is most favour- able to the crop. The preponderance of evidence is in favour of the lighter mixed soils, and not of the richest and heaviest black soil. Mr. Ebden, Collector of Ahmednagar, gives the following description of it: "When grown for ganja the plant requires a rich friable soil, and land near a village site is often selected on account of the manure with which native habits supply it. Irri- gation being necessary in case of insufficient rain, bagait land is preferred. When the plant is grown for seed or for the manufacture of bhang only irrigation is not essential, and in ordinary seasons any good jirait land will do." It is principally in Satara that the richest lands are said to be preferred, but in the ganja-growing tract of that district they are probably not the adhesive clay which is the consistency of the best black soils in the Deccan. Rotation is necessary; good crops of hemp cannot be got off the same land in successive years. The field is thoroughly worked up for some month or two before the south-west monsoon, and is heavily manured, sometimes by folding sheep upon it. In Khandesh the seed is sown in the very commencement of the rainy season, i.e., early in June, the munga nakshatra. Further south it is put in later, viz., in the Punarvasa and Pushya nakshatras, which correspond with July-August. The seed generally preferred is that from Ahmednagar. Sowing and treatment of thecrop. 197. The agricultural processes are the same everywhere. The seed is sown with a single drill, the other pipes of the ordinary triple drill being closed if that implement is used. The lines are from one-and-a-half to two feet apart. The seed springs up within a week, and the plants are allowed to grow till they are about one foot high, the field being kept scrupulously clean meanwhile by the cattle hoe and hand weeding. The rows are now thinned out where they are too crowded, and the lower branches are removed to force up the growth of the tops of the plants. The weeding with the cattle hoe earths up the rows in some degree. In about six weeks from the sowing the plants have reached a height of two feet. The parakhai or parakadaris then called in. Witness (47), Superintendent, Office of Survey Commissioner, and Director of Land Record and Agriculture, says that the ganja cultivators of the Poona district are skilled in distinguishing the male plants. Everywhere else the parakhai, or examination for male plant, is done by an expert, who is paid at the rate of Rs. 8 to Rs. 10, or even more, a month. The plants are at the same time thinned out where necessary to allow of lateral growth. The witness just quoted also states that the female plants are bruised by giving them a half twist a few inches above the root to induce this lateral growth. This process is not described by any other witness. Mr. Ebden, however, furnishes the interesting information that it is part of the parakhai's business to search the country round if he finds symptoms of mischief caused by "pernicious plants." He also says that in the seed field the parakhai is not required. But this may be doubted, for Mr. Kennedy (54), Superintendent of Police, has learnt that the female (sic) plant is eliminated from the seed field, from which it would appear that some extermination of plants is practised here also. Probably attention is directed, as in the seed field of Khandwa, to the eradication of the bi-sexual plants of all kinds. Male and female plants and theirdifferent forms. 198. The educated witnesses who have supplied the information before the Commission understand clearly enough the broad dis- tinction between the male and female plants and their
76 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. V. functions, but the cultivators seem to be very hazy on the subject (Mr. Ebden). In spite of the fact that one or two of the names applied to the various undesirable plants which the parakhai casts out show a correct understanding of the reason why they are mischievous, these names without distinction are given by two witnesses as names of diseases, and it is probable that the plants indicated are popularly regarded as diseased plants. Yet it is difficult to believe that there should be so wide a gulf between this ignorance and the intelligence found in the Central Provinces among people of the same race and occupation, and not separated from the Bombay cultivators by any great dis- tance as distances go in India. The forms of the plant, noxious from the point of view of the ganja grower, which have received special names, are given below, with the explanations of the witnesses regarding them in brief. These explanations are evidently gathered from informants, and are not based on the witnesses' own observations, except in the case of Mr. Ebden. Andya (36), Andia (30).CH. V.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 77 Remark.78 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. V. Cultivation in Gujarat. 199. About the cultivation in Gujarat the information is that loamy or sandy soils are suitable, and that black soil is not; that the crop takes six or seven months to mature; that it can be raised either as a monsoon crop or as a cold-weather crop; that the former yields the stronger narcotic; that the males are extirpated; and that irrigation is not required. There is no information about the employ- ment of the parakhai, and it is probable that in this cultivation for bhang the moderate skill possessed by the cultivators themselves answers all purposes. Both in the Deccan and Gujarat the cultivators are of the ordinary class; the industry is not confined to any caste or grade among them. The cultivators in Ahmednagar are sometimes Brahmins. Bombay States. 200. The description of the cultivation given above applies to the Southern Maratha Country Agency and all the States in the Southern and Central Divisions where they have any cultivation at all. The following agencies have not any regular cultivation: Kathiawar, Cutch, Palanpur, Mahi Kantha, and Rewa Kantha. Such cultivation as there is consists in the rearing of a few plants which have often sprung up by accident by water-courses in gardens and in fields, generally irrigated fields, such as those where sugarcane is grown. There is no information as to whether the male plants are eradicated, or of any peculiar methods employed in the culti- vation. The cultivators are either consumers, often fakirs and bairagis, or, if not, ordinary husbandmen who nurse a few plants to provide themselves with an article that will be an acceptable present to such people. The drugs appear to be very rarely sold. Aden. 201. There is no cultivation of any kind in Aden. Sind. 202. There appear to be two methods of cultivation in Sind, as stated by witness (5)--one by well irrigation, and the other by artificial inundation or flooding. In the latter case it would seem that the preliminary flooding has to suffice for the whole growth of the crop. The best descriptions are given by witnesses (2) and (14). The regular cultivation. 203. In cultivation by well the area is generally smaller than in the other process (2). This would be expected, for the former involves a greater amount of labour in the preparation of the land, systematic sowing in ridges, and periodical water- ing. Mr. Giles' account apparently describes the cultivation under wells, which he states to be the more general. High tilth and manuring are required, goats' dung being the manure preferred. The seed is sown even as late as the beginning of January. It is put in by pinches of five or six seeds at a time on ridges. The crop is gathered in April and May. The male plants are rooted up and thrown away as useless. When the crop is ripening, some of the flower-heads are cut off and preserved separately. These are called ghundyun, and are said to be more intoxicating than the rest of the plants. Small pieces of ghundyun, which fall off apparently in the drying of the rest of the crop, are called dodo or dodi, and are preserved with the ghundyun. Witness (14), in describing cultivation by period- ical irrigation and not mere flooding, states that the seed is sown broadcast; that after a preliminary soaking the ground has to be worked up, the seed sown, and the ground again turned over and levelled in one day. Manuring, says this
CH. V.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 79 witness, is generally deferred till the plants have made some growth for fear of a noxious worm which attacks the young plants. When the seedlings have appeared two or three inches above ground, weeding begins, and the plants are thinned out. When the plants are a foot high, they are dressed with manure, and this may be done more than once during the period of growth. When the crop reaches the height of about five feet, the male plants, which are dis- tinguishable by their small pale-green flowers, are weeded out. The reasons assigned for this practice are that the female may have more room to grow, and that the male plant is held to cause giddiness when used. Male plant extirpated. 204. This witness says nothing about the separate collection of certain of the flower spikes, but witness (26) does: "The big ghundis are separated and kept apart to be used as ganja." It may be that this account refers to selection made at the time of manufacture, and not to such a selection from the still standing crop as Mr. Giles seems to indicate. Broadcast sowing appears to be the more common practice, except where a few plants are grown for private consumption. In that case the sides of water-courses appear to be a favourite situation for the plant. The evidence does not show that the people understand the effect of removing the males in increasing the secretion of resin in the female flower spikes. It would seem that the produce of the female plant is preferred for consumption, and that the male is removed because it interferes with the growth of the superior plant. It is in fact treated as a weed. It cannot, however, be doubted that the practice of eradicating it is general. Witness (10) mentions some curious practices intended to enhance the narcotic quality of the drugs, the like of which have been described elsewhere. Some people, says this witness, make an incision in the stem of the bhang plant and put opium into it, sometimes a dead snake is buried under the plant, or it is watered with dhatura-water or huka-water. Hindus probably preponderate among the cultivators. 205. Hindus appear to be the chief growers of bhang, while the majority of ordinary cultivators are Muhammadans. Mr. Giles writes that "the actual sowing of the seed, the ploughing, weeding, and bird scaring, etc., is always carried out by Bania or Hindu cultivators, the Muhammadan cultivator supplying the bullocks which work the well and the zamindar giving the land. The Bania supplies the seed, but the manure is given in the same proportion as the produce is divided, i.e.,one-fifth to the Bania and two-fifths each to the raiyat and the landholder. The landholder also gives takavi or advance in cash to the raiyat." This seems to describe a partnership of a kind which probably exists in the cultivation of other produce in the same country; but there is other evidence to show that the Hindus preponderate in growing this particular crop. The habit or custom is not, however, sufficiently well marked to be regarded as a special feature of the industry. Khairpur. 206. The cultivation in Khairpur is not likely to differ from that of the rest of Sind. There is no detailed information about it. Berar. 207. In Berar, as elsewhere, the pandhri or white land near villages is prefer- red; black soil is too stiff, and has to be made lighter with heavy manuring. The crop is grown in the
80 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION 1893-94. [CH. V. south-west monsoon, sown in June, and gathered in November. It must be protected by a well in case of failure of timely rain. The official report says: "If the rains fall favourably, no irrigation is required till about October, when the plants are maturing, when apparently they always require to be watered." The cultivation of Berar does not differ materially from that of Khandwa, whence the seed seems to be imported. There is one curious practice which the Com- mission have not heard of elsewhere. The seed which is sown with the drill is a mixture of Cannabis and Hibiscus cannabinus. When the seedlings are a fortnight old, the Hibiscus plants are weeded out. One witness explains this practice as being due to the fact that hemp seed will not germinate by itself. The official explanation, which is probably correct, is that the hemp seed is by this means economised, the necessary space between the plants being secured at the expense of Hibiscus seed. The male plants (bhangra) are picked out after the crop has reached one-and-a-half feet in height. One witness (9) states that the malis who carry on the cultivation are able to distinguish the sexes, and one other (7) that the services of experts are required. The others are silent on the point. Witness (14) mentions the practice of opening the lower part of the stem, inserting opium, and binding the part up very tightly to increase the narcotic quality of the drug. The same witness moves on the date of sowing to the Punarvasu and Pusha nakshatras, July-August, which is the sowing time in the Bombay Deccan. Witness (11) states that under native rule the plant was cultivated by consumers in the yards of houses. It was watered, and when it had grown sufficiently to allow the sex to be discovered, the ganja smokers uprooted and threw away male plants. There is no particular class of cultivators, unless it be that the malis pre- ponderate among them for the reason that their vocation is cultivation by means of well irrigation. Ajmere. 208. In Ajmere there is but a small amount of desultory cultivation by the Brahmins of Pushkar, malis, and sadhus. The plant may be occasionally tended with some care when it is grown in the garden of a mali or near the hut of a sadhu; but there is some evid- ence that it is generally allowed to take care of itself. Mr. White King's report of 1886 says: "Even in Pushkar, however, it is grown only in small quantities on the edges of fields and along the banks of water-channels," and this seems to be the most considerable cultivation in the province. This report does not indicate any great care in the cultivation. The produce, according to the same report, is merely bhang. The evidence does not furnish any details whatever of the method of cultivation. Coorg. 209. In Coorg the methods of desultory homestead cultivation may be em- ployed by some low class coolies. A witness talks of the seeds being "sown broadcast in rich soil mixed with burnt clay, and afterwards transplanted in good rich soil;" but it is not clear that this method is in vogue in Coorg. Some Madras witnesses gave information of the same kind. Baluchistan. 210. There is no information from Baluchistan. Burma. 211. Mr. Bridges (3) and the ex-Sawbwa of Nyaungwe State (50) are the only witnesses who give any details of the cultivation in Burma. The Shans and the Danu people appear to rear the plant for the drug in their homestead land; the Kachins, Palaungs,
CH. V.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 81 and Lawas to cultivate for fibre in fields. Mr. Bridges is informed that in the former cultivation the male plant is exterminated. The ex-Sawbwa does not know of this practice. But he says that the stem of the plant is split when about the thickness of the finger and a month before maturity, and a piece of wood inserted. A light earthen chatty, or more often a basket, is placed over the flower-head, and allowed to rest upon it, to prevent the plant growing and make the head grow thick. In order to do this, the flower-bearing branches are gathered together and thrust into the vessel, which has a mouth of about a foot in diameter. This is the regular practice in cultivation for drugs. The chatty or basket is kept on the plant for about a month. These processes are not unknown in India. The splitting of the stem is frequently mentioned, but the use of the chatty in only two provinces. No account of the Kachin cultivation has been furnished. Mysore. 212. A peculiar method of cultivation is described by the Special Assistant Excise Commissioner and the Excise Assistant Supervisor, Tumkur district: "The seeds are sown in a nursery at the beginning of the south-west monsoon. A month after sowing the seedlings are transplanted into pits, each one foot deep, and dug at intervals of three feet, and well manured. The young plants are watered daily for a month or so. The stem of the plant is twisted just above the ground, and the plant itself is bent horizontally to the level of the earth in order to induce the growth of side branches and prevent the vertical growth of the plants like a stick. Just after the appearance of blossoms on the female plants, male plants are destroyed, etc." Such is the latter officer's description. The last sentence is rather faulty, for the extermination of the male plant after the female was ready to receive its attentions would not be of much use. Mr. McDonnell describes a very similar, but even more remarkable, method, to judge by its results in the size of the plant: "When specially cultivated, a circular pit two or three feet in diameter and a foot or so deep is excavated, and well manured with cow-dung and ashes. The plants are made to form a circle round the edge of the pit, and the centre is heaped up with manure as required. The stems rise five to seven and often twelve feet high, each as thick as a man's wrist, and are supported by staves secured with ligatures from the aloe leaf. In other cases single plants are raised in each pit. The stem is then the thickness of a man's arm, five feet high, and as much in diameter. The stem is taken in both hands, and twisted at the root just above the surface of the ground to stunt the growth .................. The male plant is profitless, and is uprooted and thrown away." It is by no means clear to what extent these methods are actually practised, and, for the practical purpose of pro- ducing ganja, the important operation of early eliminating the male plant has hardly sufficient prominence in their description. There appears to be a spice of imagination about them82 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. V. distant village is unavoidably necessary." The names of "male and unhealthy kind of plant" which must be weeded out are- In Telugu countryCH. V.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 83 new seed. The soil on which the plant is grown in Dewas is described as "dry, stony, elevated loam." In these States the cultivation is not carried on by any particular class, but it would appear that in Rewah the Kachis alone undertake the industry. The Political Agent of Bhopawar gives the following description of the desultory kind of cultivation employed in that part of Central India: "Hemp seed is sown in poppy or maize fields. When the plant is above two-and-a- half feet high, the main stem is split near the root and a piece of tile thrust in. This prevents the plant from setting seed freely and makes the tops fit for ganja. When particularly strong ganja is required, each hemp plant is watered once with half a tola of opium dissolved in water. The cultivators believe that by transplanting the young plant into the mouth of a dead venomous snake (cobra preferred) the ganja becomes unusually strong." The Commission have heard of the extirpation of male plants in the cultivation of the Gwalior State, and the same information is furnished by Mr. Gopal Ram in the appendix to the North-Western Provinces memorandum. The latter authority also mentions that the crop is irrigated, and that "some cultivators sow wheat in the ganja fields in the months of October and November." The cultivation covers the season from July to December. Baroda. 216. No details are furnished in the State report, but the cultivation is of very small extent, and it may be confidently assumed that its methods are the same as those of the Guja- rat Division of Bombay, with which the greater part of the Baroda territory is intermingled. Kashmir. 217. The State report would show that there is no cultivation in Kashmir. Dr. Royle's "Fibrous Plants of India" and the refer- ences to the hemp plant in "Punjab Products" have been consulted without finding any definite statement to contradict this in- formation. In the latter work both the bhang and "fibre" sent from Kashmir and Ladakh to the Punjab Exhibition are mentioned, but they may very well have been the produce of the wild growth. Dr. Watt refers in his "Hemp or Canna- bis sativa" to cultivation of the plant in Kashmir, but without mentioning his authority. Dr. Royle's abstract of information at page 327 states: "All along the Himalayas, that is, in Nepal, in Kumaon, in Garhwal, and up to the newly acquired hills of the Punjab, at elevations of from 3,000 and 4,000 to 7,000 feet hemp is cultivated by the hillmen." Beyond this point westward his information does not go. There is a curious statement by the Governor of Kashmir that "almost all wild hemp, whch is called talia in the Punjab, and is generally female plants in the above-mentioned tahsils, is used for the preparation of ganja locally known by name gard bhang (chura charas)." The meaning is not clear; but the preponderance of the female plants, if it is the fact, indicates either some peculiarity in the environment of the plant in these regions or tend- ing by man. Nepal. Mr. Hodgson84 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. V 323 a description by Mr. Hodgson of the cultivation for fibre. He states that the cultivation is peculiar to the northern districts of Nepal. These districts, "popularly called Cachar, are nevertheless the prime seats of culture, and there alone is the plant manufactured into rope or cloth, though the edible extracts are sometimes prepared nearer to and around Katmandu." Regular cultivation for fibre is therefore confined to the northern districts. The season of sowing is from March to April. The season is earlier, but the course of cultivation is much the same as in Kumaon. Mr. Hodgson states that "damp soils, comprising black earth, are fittest for this crop." This description does not agree with other information on the subject. The plants flower and fruit in July, and are in their full growth at the beginning of August. While yet succulent and in flower they are cut, with the exception of some seed plants, which are not to be reaped till October. It is the bark of the young but full grown July plants which is soft that is used for making cloth. That of the old or October plants is hard and not suitable for manufacture. Mr. Hodgson says nothing in the extract made by Dr. Royle, if there is anything to be said, of the processes adopted for developing the narcotic in the growing plant. The fibre cultivator of Kumaon does not apparently do anything with this special object, and yet his female plant yields charas. It is probable that the early removal of the males may have the tendency in both places. Information furnished by the Dar- bar. 219. The Darbar answers say nothing about the fibre cultivation, but they con- tain some information regarding the scattered cultiva- tion for narcotics. The following morsels may be quoted: "When the plants put forth fine down, the tip of the plants is cut off, and the big leaves are plucked off, and the plant is shaken from time to time so that the down may fall off. This causes a large number of branches and fine leaves to be produced, and the latter, getting twisted and stuck together, are called in Nepalese lata." "The plant which produces much seed is no good; that which produces little seed is good." "Some persons in the hills plant a few trees which are to be had growing wild." "By slitting the stem of the plant and inserting a piece of opium or clove or bhiroza wood and tying up the part with a string the ganja becomes somewhat more intoxicating. This is done by those who know about it, and is not the work of any particular class." "The male plant of the ganja is solid; the female one is hollow. The male plant is more intoxicating than the female. When the plant has attained a height of two or two-and-a-half feet, it is slightly slit, and ascertained whether it is a male or female." From these extracts it may be gathered that the wild seedlings are transport- ed and planted in suitable places, and that every endeavour is then made to en- courage the secretion of the resin in the female (called male) plants. Probably the cultivators know the effect of exterminating the male plant, and follow the practice, though this is not expressly stated.

CHAPTER VI. PREPARATION OF THE RAW DRUGS FROM THE CULTIVATED AND WILD PLANT. Bengal. 220. The preparation of the finest sort of ganja is a somewhat laborious pro- cess, and requires skill and knowledge. For a full description of the preparation of flat, round, and chur ganja in the Ganja Mahal, the reader is referred to Babu Hem Chunder Kerr's report. Dr. Prain has given a shorter account of it. It must be remembered that the terms 'flat,' 'round,' and 'chur' are peculiar to the Bengal manufacture and excise system. Their exact meaning is rarely understood outside the prov- ince. The more important details of the processes may be briefly noticed. Bright sunny weather is essential to the best manufacture. The crop does not all come to maturity at the same time, and the plants must be manipulated within three or four days of maturity, or they become useless. These conditions have to be borne in mind in arranging for the manufacture, and it would seem that the plants have sometimes to be gathered before they are full ripe. The plants are cut in batches, as many as can be handled, by the available labour and means in three days. The Khasia plants are left standing, or, if gathered by mistake, are rejected in selecting the portions of the plant to be worked up. The manufacture of flat ganja. 221. The manufacture of flat ganja takes three days, and is carried out on a piece of ground near the field which has been specially levelled for the purpose, and is called the chator or khola. The number of plants handled in each three-days' operations is usually about fifty or sixty. The first day the plants are cut in the morning, brought to the manufacturing ground, and spread out in the sun till the afternoon. They are then cut up one by one into lengths of about one or two feet. Those having flower spikes upon them are retained, and the rest is thrown away. The portions selected are spread out in the dew for the night. The work of the second day begins at noon. It consists in alternately press- ing and drying the crop and getting rid of useless leaf and seed. The branches are piled by bundles of five or ten, flower spikes inwards and overlapping, in a circular heap about four feet in diameter. The workmen tread this down, mov- ing round upon it and supporting one another. Bundles are added from time to time till the heap is about two feet high. A mat is then placed over the heap, and the men sit or place weights upon it. After half an hour of the pressure the pile is unstacked, the bundles are taken off and beaten together over a mat to shake out seeds and leaf. The heap is again built exactly as before, the upper layers of the previous heap being put at the bottom of this, and the processes of treading, pressing, unstacking, and beating are repeated. The bundles are now laid out side by side on mats and trodden individually, the workman holding the stem ends with one foot while he passes the other foot downwards over the flower. The bundles are turned and beaten against the mat during this process. When it is complete, they have been reduced in size, and consist of four or five twigs each. They are then laid in slanting position over a pole on the ground, and left for the night. The third day's work begins in the early morning. The twigs are separated, and again piled in bundles in the same circular form as before, trodden for a short 22

They are then laid out in rows and trodden. During this process they are turned over, and at intervals the sun is allowed to play upon them. They are then handled again and gently beaten, and spread out more completely than before. Those that have retained an undue quantity of leaf are stood up in the sun. The last process is to press the twigs individually with the feet in the way already described. The manufacture is now complete. The flower spikes have been pressed into flat masses, and the leaf and seeds have been as far as possible removed. In the larger specimens the branches stand out from the stem and one another, the whole being quite flattened. The twigs are gathered into bundles of two standard sizes[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Survey of India Offices, Calcutta, August 1894. PREPARING FLAT GANJA, NAOGAON. 16TH FEBRUARY 1894.
CH. VI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 87 drug is the superior product, and contains much less useless matter than the flat. But it is plain that in both cases the process of manufacture in Bengal is technical and elaborate, and this is the point which it is desired to bring into strong relief. It may be noted that occasionally, when the weather is unfavourable, the drying is effected by fire, with the result that the ganja is discolored and reduced in market value. The effect of the manufacturing processes. 224. Dr. Prain describes the purposes which are served by the above pro- cesses: "The drying process (a) removes the watery juices of the plants, and thus not only reduces its weight as an excisable article, but removes to a considerable extent the risk of mould; (b) causes the comparatively inert small leaves to shrivel, and so makes their removal more easy. The kneading process (a) removes more or less com- pletely the comparatively inert leaves, still further reducing the weight. The article produced, being for its bulk more active in proportion to the absence of leaves, the more thoroughly they are removed, the better a sale does it command; (b) it presses together the resinous parts on which the active principle is most plenti- fully deposited. These being rendered somewhat sticky by the presence of the resin become more or less agglutinated, and are thus less liable to fall off in transit, and so reduce the active power of the ganja." And he discusses these principles with some care. The Commission would have been inclined to attribute a great part of the importance of the kneading process to its effect in shutting out the access of air to the interior of the ganja masses, and so tending to delay their deterioration. Disposal of stick, leaf, seeds, and fragments. 225. It has been seen that a great quantity of stick, leaf, and seed, and not a little flower head, have been separated from the bundles of prepared ganja. The stick may be used as fuel. The leaf is winnowed from the seed and thrown away, though it has been proved by analysis to contain the narcotic principle in larger quantity than ordinary bhang. But it cannot be ascertained that it is used as bhang. The seeds are kept for the next year's culture, and the superfluity may find its way into the market. The seeds are not narcotic, and they are sometimes eaten, besides being used for the expression of oil and other purposes. The bits of flower head are, in the case of flat ganja, picked up and pressed into the mass of the flower heads again or burnt. The latter will probably depend on the vigilance of the Government supervisors. In the case of round ganja, they form the "chur" or "fragments" on which the excise tariff imposes the highest duty, because in that state the drug is absolutely free of leaf and stick. Preparation of bhang. 226. Bhang as recognized by the Excise Department is the dried leaf of the wild plant. The drug that enters the Bengal golas is collected chiefly in the districts of Bhagalpur, Mon- ghyr, and Purnea. But the bhang of Patna, Benares, and Behar is also spoken of as being of high quality. The preparation consists simply in drying the leaves. The plants are cut in April, the Chaitra Sankranti being considered an auspicious as well as a seasonable day, but the gathering goes on up to June and July. They are laid out in the sun, and one day may be sufficient to dry them so as to allow the leaves to be shaken or beaten off. The leaves are collected with precautions against the mixture of dust or dirt, packed in bags, and so con- veyed to the local gola, and eventually to the shops. The early flowering stage would seem to be that in which the plant yields the best bhang.
88 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VI. From the manner of collection and manufacture, plants of both sexes and also some flower heads must enter into the product. It is stated by one witness that the seed is as far as possible separated and rejected. This is probably correct. Another states that "wild bhang is collected by the people in Bhagalpur, Monghyr, and Purnea districts in two forms-one consisting of dried leaves and small stalks, and the other of the flowering shoots; this latter not to a great extent." This appears to refer to the collection for home consumption, and not that by the licensed dealers for sale. The flowering shoots here referred to are probably the female flower heads, in which there is reason to suppose the resin is occasionally secreted in more than the usual quantity, even when the plant is uncultivated. Bhang is gathered from the spontaneous growth for home use wherever that growth is found. There is considerable conflict of opinion as to the extent of the practice. The Commission are inclined to accept Mr. Gupta's view that "the use of untaxed bhang is general," and that, among the rural population at least, the consumers collect the drug for themselves whenever the plant is at hand. Looking to the prevalence of the wild growth over a great part of Bengal, and the absence of any technicality in the preparation of the raw article, any other view would require to be supported by strong evidence. The leaf is for the most part simply dried; but Mr. Jenkins, Collector of Dacca, reports that he has been told of a more costly process, which consists in the leaf being boiled in milk and water after being sun-dried, and again dried for storage. This is confirmed by a pleader of Dinajpur, who professes to know the method of preparation of bhang from the wild plant. He says, probably confusing the sexes, that the female plant is general- ly used, though the male may be also, and that "after the leaves are dried for some time, they are boiled in a mixture of from 10 to 25 per cent. of milk and 90 to 75 per cent. of water. After drying the leaves once again, they are fit for use as siddhi or bhang." It is, however, certain that this practice is uncommon, and that simple drying is the method by which bhang is almost universally prepared for keeping. Preparation of ganja from spon- taneous growth. 227. It has already been suggested that ganja can be got from the wild plant. The question is important, and must be examined in some detail at the risk of the discussion appearing elementary to many readers. It has been shown that the plant is not wild in the exact sense of the word, and for present purposes this fact must be emphasized. The plant is not only an old escape from cultivation, but its tendency to revert to the uniform characters of a wild species is being constantly checked by contact with cultivation. Its association with man frequently supplies it with the richest kinds of food, and with all vegetation this tends to the development of abnormal characters. The generative functions may thus be affected to the extent of partial or even complete destruction in individual plants or groups of plants, and these may be of either sex. It is possible also for the female plant to be secluded in a variety of other ways. The experience of cultivation justifies the presumption that if the female plant in healthy growth is prevented from freely developing its seed, its flower spike will be highly resinous. There appears therefore to be a strong probability a priori that the spontaneous growth quite- untended should often produce a flower head which can be converted into ganja. Evidence is not wanting to corroborate this conclusion, for it speaks of wild ganja being collected and smoked; but it is impossible to pronounce posi-
CH. VI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 89 tively with regard to any of it that the plants from which the ganja was gather- ed was altogether innocent of cultivation or tending. Evidence as to existence of wild ganja. 228. The quality of this evidence may be judged from the following refer- ences. It leaves no doubt that many people are able to distinguish the plants of different sexes in the spontaneous growth, calling them by the names of ganja and bhang, and recognize the more narcotic character of the female or ganja plant, sometimes preserving it for the purpose of smoking. The Assistant to the Director of Land Records and Agriculture, when enquiring regarding the spontaneous growth in Bhagalpur and Purnea, observed that a few selected plants, mostly females, were not uncommonly left in the ground. He reports: "These acquire a nice bushy appearance not unlike that of the ganja-bearing plant. All this made me suspect that the people knew a great deal more about the bhang plant than they were willing to avow. I was told by several persons, among them a European gentleman who has long resided in North Bhagalpur, that bhang is often used to adulterate ganja." Abhilas Chandra Mukharji says: "Fata bhang (Sivajatabhang).90 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VI. inferior but smokable ganja may occasionally be obtained from the spontaneous growth. The great majority of witnesses nevertheless state that ganja is not procured from the wild plants, and undoubtedly what is ordinarily accepted as ganja cannot be so obtained. There is no evidence that it undergoes any process after being gathered but simple drying. Preparation of ganja from illicit cultivation. 229. The methods followed in the homestead cultivation of Bengal and the Tributary States of Orissa and Chota Nagpur have been described. Regarding the possibility of prepar- ing ganja from the homestead cultivation of Bengal, the Sub-divisional Officer of Jangipur may be quoted. He writes: "I have seen ganja plants detected in Bhagalpur and Jangipur. From their twigs ganja as good in appearance as in Naogaon (the particular sub-division where ganja is cultivated under Government Supervision) can be prepared, but it is alleged that the flavour is not so good as those grown in Naogaon." This cultivation is of course illegal in British terri- tory, and it is probable that but little ganja is obtained from it. No information has been gathered as to any special care being taken in the preparation of it, and it is probable that the usual practice is simply to dry it. Tributary States of Chota Nag- pur and Orissa. Preparation of ganja and bhang. 230. In the Tributary States of Chota Nagpur and Orissa ganja is said to be obtained from the wild as well as the cultivated plants, but the evidence points generally to the plant being more or less cultivated in all cases. There is evidence also that some care is taken in preparing the drug (ganja), and it is probable that the same or very similar practices prevail in both groups of States. Mr. Grimley's inquiry of 1890 gives some information on this subject. Sirguja reports: "The first leaves are plucked away, and from the second leaves the ganja and bhang are made;" and againCH. VI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 91 These processes amount after all to little more than simple drying and removal of the coarser leaves. It is difficult to understand what purpose is served by the process of burying which Mr. Taylor describes, and it may be doubted if the de- scription is accurate. The resulting product is far inferior to Rajshahi ganja. This has been amply proved by inquiries made in past years, in course of which the drugs were compared. The leaf bhang is prepared by simple drying, as in Bengal proper; but it will be seen that the weak ganja of the Garhjat is largely consumed as drink. Hill Tippera. 231. The preparation of the drugs in Hill Tippera is certainly not more ela- borate than that just described; but no information on the subject has been furnished. Preparation of charas. 232. There is no evidence of charas being made in Bengal, though the resin is available in plenty in the cultivated plant of the Ganja Mahal, and in a less degree in other growth. This form of the drug is not appreciated in the province, and the absence of demand no doubt accounts for the art of manufacture not having grown up. An infinitesimal amount may be collected from the feet and hands of the operators in the ganja manufacture, but it is doubtful if this small supply is utilized. Classes engaged in preparation of the drugs. 233. The preparation of ganja and bhang is carried out by the cultivators and the servants of the bhang contractors respectively. The preponderance of Musalmans in the cultivation of ganja in the Ganja Mahal has been noticed. Beyond this it cannot be said that the preparation of the raw drugs is the business of any special class, unless it be that the Hindus from Behar and the North-Western Provinces, being in large proportion confirmed bhang drinkers, are those who also most commonly collect that drug for home consumption. Assam. 234. The dried tops of the wild hemp plant are used to some extent for smok- ing. But there is nothing to show that the article is prepared in any other way than by simple drying. The extermination of the male plant in connection with the wild growth does not seem to be practised either in the valley or on the hills within and on the borders of the province. This is an essential preliminary to the preparation of the superior form of ganja. The dried tops make bhang which may be used for smoking or drinking. Excise ganja is known among the consumers as mohini bhang. The epithet mohini or fascinating is never applied to the wild product. There is no evidence that charas is prepared or even known in the province. North-Western Provinces. Preparation of ganja from plant cultivated secretly. 235. Mr. Stoker made special enquiries regarding the local production and preparation of ganja, and, as regards the extent of the practice, the results are given in a concise form in his memorandum. The evidence furnishes but few details of interest to add to his account. The cultivation of hemp for the production of ganja is not carried on openly. "The whole of the ganja offered for public sale is imported. At the same time it would be incorrect to say that ganja is nowhere grown or manufactured. Careful enquiry has elicited reports from several districts that a small amount of ganja is surreptitiously made." These are Mr. Stoker's words, and they exactly express the impression
92 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VI. left by the evidence which the Commission have collected. No witness has given a detailed description of the method of preparation. Mr. Stoker received a report of the process in vogue in Ghazipur, which he says "closely resembles that employ- ed in Bengal." This is only corroborated by two or three witnesses to the extent that the ganja is put under pressure. Specimens of ganja from Ghazipur and Sultanpur were forwarded to the Commission, and Mr. Stoker's opinion is that the Ghazipur specimen was superior to the ordinary pathar ganja, and not much inferior to Bengal baluchar (flat). The other was much the same as pathar. Preparation of ganja from wild growth. 236. Regarding the preparation of ganja from the wild growth, Mr. Stoker has ascertained that the produce of the female plant is smoked in the Kheri and Bara Banki districts, and he says that there are indications of similar use in other districts. The evidence on this point is rather strong, and leads to the belief that wherever the plant is common as a wild growth, the poorer classes of consumers make use of it for smoking. The distinction between the male and female plants is well known, as Mr. Stoker states; and some of the witnesses say that the plants are operated upon by twisting the stems to prevent flowering. The plants so treated must be the ganja or females, though that is not expressly stated in all cases. But witness (155) may be referred to, who states that bhang is the natural plant; when it is twisted it is called ganja. A Deputy Collector (46) states that ganja can be prepared from wild female hemp plants if all the males are uprooted from their neighbourhood, and he is a witness who does not appear to be drawing on information he may have picked up regarding other provinces. It has been seen in connection with the cultivation that the advantage of isolating the females is known to some persons, the knowledge having been handed down from a time when ganja was openly cultivated, and it is difficult to believe that it should be confined to a very small number. The fakirs all over the country, who are mentioned as the principal secret cultivators, are certainly not ignorant on this point, and would disseminate the knowledge. The report of the Deputy Commissioner of Kheri, quoted by Mr. Stoker, that this art is not known, appears therefore to be open to doubt, or, if true, to be true only of the locality reported upon. The subject is probably one on which people are inclined to be reticent for the same reasons as actuated those of whom the Assistant to the Director of Land Records and Agriculture in Bengal made his enquiries. The rearing and tending of the hemp plant in the North-Western Provinces may not be illegal; but there is plently of evidence that the people think it to be so, and that would be sufficient to make them cautious in giving informa- tion. There is no evidence that the ganja gathered from the wild plant is prepared by any other process than mere drying. Witness (202), a raiyat of the Kheri district, and (48), a Deputy Collector of Lucknow, state that the ganja plants are gathered in November and December. This would seem to refer to the higher lands. The season of growth on the low lands appears to be from December to June. It may be noted that Mr. Wall, a late Commissioner of Excise, does not believe that ganja is produced by the wild plant, and that many other witnesses take the same view. The local production of ganja does not appear to have ever been so considerable, at least in recent years, as to attract the attention of Government in the Excise Department, and there is no reason to suppose that it has increased since it was suppressed in Oudh. The subject therefore is only of secondary importance.
CH. VI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 93 Preparation of bhang. 237. Bhang is prepared by cutting and drying the plants, cultivated or wild, and shaking or beating out the leaves. This is done either by the contractors themselves, or by "resid- ents of jungly tracts for sale to licensed vendors" (38). The districts where the cultivated bhang is produced have been named. The supply of wild bhang is drawn from various places in the belt of wild growth below the Himalayas. The gathering goes on from March to June. The zamindars on whose lands the plant grows appear to make some money by selling it to the contractors (247). Bhang is sometimes dried under straw or other covering, when it turns yellow, instead of retaining the green colour, which it does if dried in the sun (21, 248, 203). The object of this is not clear. Preparation of charas. 238. In these provinces charas is prepared to a small extent from the crops grown for fibre in the Himalayas, to a less extent from the Himalayan wild growth, and to a still smaller extent from the wild growth of the plains. A very small amount may even be prepared from the plants cultivated in a desultory way. The methods of preparing charas from the fibre plants are described by witness (49). The sujango or female plants, having been cut in November, are spread out to dry for twenty-four hours. The people then sit round in the heat of the day, and pluck off the flower heads, which are now full of seed, discarding the coarser leaves. Each handful is rubbed between the palms for about ten minutes and thrown aside. In course of time a quantity of juice accumulates on the palms, which is scraped off and rolled into balls. These are charas. Sometimes the plants are trodden instead of handled, and the feet scraped. A more uncommon method, by which a choice kind of charas called chahar mulhi is obtained, is to pass the hands up the ripe plants while they are still standing in the field. This plan is not approved, the witness says, because it is supposed to damage the fibre. Other witnesses (21, 43) mention the practice of running through the crop or growth on a dewy morning, and scraping off the resin which adheres to the body. Witness (248) states that the resin, having been collected, is kneaded on hot stones; but the account of witness (49) that the process of manufacture ordinarily ceases with the making of the resin as scraped from the hands into balls is prob- ably reliable. There is a considerable amount of evidence and opinion that charas is pre- pared from wild plants. Witness (49) states that in a small area at an elevation of 8,000 feet called Urgum in Palli Talla Pamkhanda, which appears to be a pargana of Garhwal, the wild hemp is of superior quality. It grows near a temple of Siva, to which fact the people attribute its superiority. Charas is made from it by the common process of rubbing with the hands, and is given to fakirs and pilgrims to Kedarnath and Badrinath. Witness (232) speaks of the manufacture from the wild plants, and states that the leaves after the rubbing form ganja or bhang, which is used for drinking. Witness (43) deposes to the production of charas from the wild growth in the Bhabar and Terai. Witness (109) has seen it made apparently in the Almora country. Witness (38) has seen the process on the banks of the Gogra which bounds the Nepal and British territories. And so we are brought down to the plains. Mr. Stoker writes that "in Garhwal a sub- stance is produced which might be classed with either ganja or charas. After the charas has been extracted from the female flower, the powdered or broken 24
94 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VI. flowers are mixed with hemp seed and smoked in a chillum. This seems akin to the garda of the Punjab." Miscellaneous information about the preparation of charas. 239. The evidence from this province contains information about the manu- facture of charas in Nepal, Yarkand, Peshawar, and Kandahar, which may be noted, though it is not all direct evidence. The Bhutias of Nepal scatter ashes on the plants in the even- ing. In the morning they enter and walk through the crop or jungle clothed in leather, to which the resin adheres. This is scraped off and makes a strong kind of charas. It may be noted that Dr. Gimlette, Residency Surgeon, Katmandu, was unable to verify the accounts he had heard of this process, but found that in the country 50 miles round the capital the drug was collected by rubbing the young flowering tops between the hands in situ (Watt). In Yarkand, according to witness (62), the dried plants are beaten over a cloth, and the greyish powder, which falls upon it, is collected and packed in bags, where it agglutinates by some process, of which exposure to the sun forms part. Witness (192) has "seen charas prepared near Peshawar and Kandahar. People go into the fields with leather leggings on, and the charas sticks to them, and is scraped off." The same witness has seen bhang prepared in great quantities at Hardwar, Lahore, Kabul, and Kandahar. North-Western Provinces States. 240. Regarding the Native States in the North-Western Provinces, there is nothing to be added to the information collected for the province generally. Punjab. 241. Though some witnesses make mention of the smoking of bhang leaves, there is no evidence of the preparation of the flower head either of the uncultivated or cultivated plant for use as ganja. The smoking of the produce of the plant in any form except charas is evidently extremely rare. According to witness (59), "the word 'ganja' is sometimes applied to charas." Preparation of bhang. 242. Bhang is prepared both from the uncultivated plant and from the small quantity of cultivated plant in the ordinary way, viz.,by simple drying. Mr. Drummond (13) says that the flowering tops are preferred. The zamindars do not generally take any payment for the bhang gathered from their lands. The plant grows from December to June-July. The usual time for gathering appears to be May. No. (73) says May or June. Lala Kesho Das, Extra Assistant Commissioner, reports that in June-July "the hemp plant acquires peculiarly noxious qualities, and hence it is during that fortnight that bhang intended to be used as a drug is cut." The bhang of some localities is regarded as superior, such as that of Ambota and Gagret, of Bhimbar in Kashmir, and of Gurdaspur. The cultivated plant may yield a superior quality of drug, but there is not much evidence of any preference for it over the wild drug. Preparation of charas. 243. There is practically no evidence of charas being prepared below the mountains. The method of preparation followed in Kulu and the Hill States is that of rubbing the flower heads between the hands and scraping off the resin accumulated on the palms or
CH. VI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 95 on the feet if the operation consisted in treading the plants. The solitary piece of definite information supplied about preparation in the plains is given by Mr. Kirthi Singh (14): "Sometimes a cultivator may want a little charas for private use, in which case he beats the flowering twigs over a piece of cloth laid on the ground, and then collects the greyish white powder which falls. This requires only to be dried a little in the sun, and it is ready for use." Charas in "Punjab Products." 244. In the "Punjab Products" the manufacture of this sort of charas called garda is described. The finest quality is when the dust is of a reddish colour. This is called surkha. When it is green, it is called bhangra. The most inferior is that which adheres to the cloth after shaking, and has to be scraped off or shaken off with more violence. This is called khaki. In each case the dust has to be kneaded with a small quantity of water into a cake, and then forms charas. It is stated that this drug is much in use. The specimens which formed the basis of the article were none of them from the plain districts of the Punjab, except possibly one from Dera Ghazi Khan. They came from Lahoul, Spiti, Bokhara, Yarkand, Dera Ghazi Khan, and Kashmir. Preparation of charas in Yarkand. 245. It will be of interest to quote other descriptions of foreign manufacture. Witness (86) has been in the habit of visiting Ladakh for purposes of trade, and has there learnt the following details from Ladakh merchants: "In Yarkand bhang is cultivated in the month of Baisakh in waste lands and round the fields of other crops for the manufacture of charas. It remains standing for seven months, and is then reaped in the month of Katik, when the blossom is ripe, and then stored on the roofs of houses. It remains there for one month and gets dried in the mean- time. The zamindars then thrash the plants after separating the larger leaves by night within their houses. The smaller petals and flowers then fall on the ground and are reduced to powder. It is then sifted thrice, put in bags, and sold to the traders. The merchants go on storing it up until the month of Jeth comes, when they place it in the sun, and a kind of oleaginous substance oozes out of the powder. It is then kneaded like tobacco and put in bags made of cloth. The following three or four kinds of charas are prepared from it96 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VI. Central Provinces. Preparation of ganja. 247. The method of preparing Khandwa ganja is described by the Deputy Commissioner of Nimar and the Excise Commission- er. The harvest begins in the first or second week of November. The flower heads, which the cultivators call mal or produce, are broken off with about twelve inches of twig, carried in baskets to the threshing- floor, and spread out on it in a layer nine to twelve inches thick. Mr. Robertson states that on the first day a heavy roller is passed over them, but this detail is not contained in Mr. Drake-Brockman's report. The crop is exposed to the dew for the night. The next day the twigs are formed into heaps, and each heap is trodden in turn, and when not being trodden is turned over and exposed to the sun to dry. This goes on for four or five days, and results in the twigs being pressed flat and deprived of a great portion of their leaves and thoroughly dried. The produce is then removed to the cultivator's house, where it is built into a stack five or six feet high, and has heavy weights placed upon it. In about a week it is packed in gunny bags and removed to the storehouse at Khandwa. Khandwa ganja inferior to that of Bengal. 248. In outward appearance the Khandwa ganja or pathar differs from that of Bengal or baluchar in being green in colour, and having a much larger quantity of leaf left in it. It does not bear any comparison in the appreciation of smokers with baluchar.The latter is a very special article, and no ganja will be found to compare with it in any province. Bhang is not produced in the Central Provinces. Khandwa ganja is used instead for drinking purposes by the commoner sort of consumers. Well-to-do people import their bhang from Central India. It is, however, difficult to believe that the leaf and fragments resulting from the manufacture of Khandwa ganja do not pass into consumption at all. There is some evidence that they do. In Bengal the ganja cultivators could afford to throw away the leaves, for the wild bhang was to be got for nothing within a reasonable distance, and made better bhang than the cultivated leaf, which was consequently of no value. In the Central Provinces the case is different, and it may be doubted if the people are altogether careless of the leaf as a secondary product. There is no evidence of charas being prepared in the Central Provinces. The ganja, having passed into the Khandwa godown, is picked before issue to contractors, and again picked before issue from the tahsils, so that about 45 per cent. only finds its way into the retail shop. Feudatory States, Central Prov- inces. 249. The Feudatory States prepare no drugs. Madras. Bhang not known as distinct from ganja. 250. In the Madras Presidency, especially towards the south, the name bhang is applied almost exclusively to the prepared drink, which may be made from the pure leaves, but is generally made from the material which is known and sold as ganja. Bhang as a distinct form of the raw drug is not known, It is even doubtful if the plant itself in the part of the country indicated is called bhang. It would seem that as the region of wild growth is left behind, the name by which the cultivated plant is known, viz., ganja, comes more into general use. It will not, therefore, be necessary to mention bhang in this chapter except where it comes into the description of ganja preparation. Charas is not manufactured at all in the Madras Presidency.
CH. VI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 97 Preparation of ganja in North Arcot. 251. Mr. Benson has given a description of the preparation of ganja in con- nection with the regular cultivation in the North Arcot and Kistna districts. The methods differ materially. "In the Javadi Hills the plants are cut and carried bodily to the village thresh- ing floor. They are there sorted, the flower spikes and upper leaves being retained and the sticks thrown away. The selected heads are spread out for three to five hours in the heat of the day to dry, and are then loosely rolled in the hand to work out such seed as may have been formed and to break up the leaf that remains. This working also causes the spikes to stick to one another to some extent. The broken leaf is then winnowed out, collected, and powdered." The flower heads are then placed in a thin layer in a basket which has been dusted within with leaf powder, and are trodden by one or two men according to the size of the basket. After the operator has passed over the layer four or five times, it is dusted with leaf powder, and a fresh layer of spikes is put into the basket on the top of the other, and the treading is repeated. This process goes on till the basket is full. The contents are then turned out on to flat hard ground, and a stone is placed on the pile with other stones to add to the weight. The material is left thus for the night. Next morning each layer is taken off separately, broken up, and spread in the sun. Each piece is trodden and turned over from time to time. In the evening the pieces are again re-piled and weighted for the night, and the next day the process of exposure is repeat- ed until the material is thoroughly dry. "Great importance is attached to the thoroughness of the treading, the sufficiency of the pressing, and the complete- ness of the drying; the quality of the drug being said to depend on the manner in which those processes are carried out. If the latter are not dried sufficient- ly, they appear green and are of inferior quality, good ganja being brown." When fully cured, the drug is stored in the raiyats' houses under pressuretill sold. Preparations of ganja in the Kistna district. 252. In the Kistna district, if Mr. Benson is correct, the pressing is entirely neglected. The plants are cut bodily and laid out in the field for three days to dry. On the fourth day they are tied by bundles of ten and piled head and tail. "The heaps are open- ed and the bundles re-piled next day, the process being repeated over several days." If the quantity is small, the drying is done at the raiyat's house, but in all cases the crop is finally carried to the house. A month later the spikes are removed one by one, and spread out in the open for one night to soften and be- come pliable. In the morning the spikes are collected and put into large gunny bags, being packed closely therein by a man treading them down. The produce is then ready for sale. Peculiar method of preparing bhang. 253. The process has been described shortly by other witnesses. They nearly all mention pressing as a part of it, though the methods may be different. Alternate exposure to sun and dew seems also to be generally practised. The drug is usually stored by consumers in earthen vessels. One witness (106) from Ganjam, after giving a careful description of the manufacture of ganja, proceeds to say that the dried leaves which have fallen out in the process are used as bhang or patti. "After carefully removing the stalks, the dried leaves are boiled in water for some time; and the boiled leaves are carefully squeezed with the hands to purge them of all filth and dirt, and then dried in the sun. The dried leaves are next boiled 25
98 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VI. either in milk or cocoanut water. The quantity of milk or cocoanut water must be proportionate to the quantity of leaves boiled, so that the milk or cocoanut water might be entirely absorbed by the leaves. They are again kept in the hot sun for about three or four days. After they are well dried, they are preserved in earthen vessels for use." Similar processes were mentioned in the Bengal evidence, but they require so much care and time that they can hardly be common. Travancore. 254. The following information seems to point to the preparation of ganja from the spontaneous growth in Travancore. It is said that poo ganja, or flowering ganja, is pressed together while still green so as to get matted, and when the mass begins to show signs of rotting, "it is dried in the shade and passed off in the market as chada ganja."

He also mentions a process resembling that noticed in the Punjab, by which the dust made by beating the plant is collected on cloth. He stales that this process is peculiar to Afghanistan : "And the charas imported from there is well known for its pale green colour, and is highly appreciated." Preparation of fibre. 260. It is interesting also to note that two or three witnesses, Mr. Giles being one, report the preparation of fibre from the hemp grown in Sind. Mr. Giles says: "Sometimes, but very rarely, the thick stalks of the plant are placed in water to rot, and with great labour rope or twine is made from them by individual persons for special pur- poses; but the plant is never grown for the use of its fibre or of its seed only." Witness (14) states that: "The bhang plant stalks are usually buried in soft wet mud for a few days instead of being soaked in water, as in the case of the sihata or the ak." The fibre production seems to be very limited in amount, but it is worth special notice because this is the only mention of its occurrence below the Himalayas in the evidence collected by the Commission. Berar. 261. The official memorandum gives the following description of the pre- paration of ganja in Berar. It is very imperfect, and the process probably resembles closely that followed in the Deccan or Khandwa: "The small outer branches are stripped off and put in towards the centre of the plant, which is then pressed with the foot (to flatten the heads), made up into sheaves, and stacked in a shed under pressure, the heaps being opened and the sheaves moved now and then to prevent their getting too hot. The leaves fall off when the plants are tied into bundles. They are collected and called bhang. The bare stalks remain with the heads in them." One witness (23) mentions the preparation by burying, which has been mentioned elsewhere. Witnesses (10) and (9) say that the crop is trodden by bullocks, which seems very improbable. It is clear that the bhang locally prepared is simply the refuse from the manufacture of ganja. Ajmere. 262. There is nothing to show that the plant in Ajmere is subjected to anything more than a process of drying to produce bhang. Coorg. 263. From Coorg it is stated that the female plants are cut down and exposed to the sun for a day. They are then collected into bundles and exposed to the sun by day and dew by night for three days, after which they are wrapped up in coarse cloths or kamblis, and so preserved. It is to be remembered that the cultivation consists only of the surreptitious rearing of plants on a small scale. Baluchistan. 264. There is no information from Baluchistan. Burma. 265. There is no information that the ganja of the Shan country is prepared by any other process than drying. A specimen of Kachin ganja was forwarded to the Commission, and consisted of bundles of flower tops and leaves loosely rolled together. It looked like the produce of the wild plant.
CH. VI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 101 Mysore. 266. The details of information describing the preparation of ganja in My- sore are limited to drying in the sun and tying into bundles. Mr. McDonnell's memorandum does not give a description of the Mysore practice. What he says about the Vellore and Cocanada samples agrees with what has been learnt from Mr. Benson's bulletin. Hyderabad. 267. The Director of Agriculture and Commerce gives a description of the preparation of ganja which does not differ from the method pursued in the Bombay Deccan. Bhang is the leaf and other litter which falls away in the manufacture of ganja. Rajputana. 268. Such cultivation as exists in Rajputana, both regular and scattered, seems to be chiefly directed to the production of bhang. Jhallawar, however, reports a production of 165 maunds of ganja, and some of the superior drug appears to be turned out in Serohi also. An inferior sort, called makuria ganja, is spoken of in Marwar, but appears to be little better than the female flowers of a bhang crop of the ordi- nary kind. It is stated in the Jaisalmir report that the ganja produced there is never prepared by treading, and from other places that the drug, whatever it may be, undergoes no process but drying. One informant states that charas is sup- posed to be prepared chiefly by the Bhils in Jodhpur. No foundation for this statement can be discovered. Fakirs may rub the heads of the plants they have grown in their lands and get a little charas occasionally; but even that seems im- probable, as it requires a great deal of flower head to make a reasonable quantity of charas. Central India. 269. Mr. Gunion's memorandum furnishes an account of the manufacture of ganja in Indore and Dewas. The processes com- prise the same three principal features as elsewhere, viz., drying, kneading with the feet, and removal of leaf. They occupy three or four days. In Indore the manufactured produce is kept under pressure till sold. From the description of the preparation of bhang in these States, it would seem that it is made from a crop grown for seed or bhang and not from the ganja crop. The plants are bodily dried and threshed, and the seeds are separated from "the crushed leaves and tender twigs, which are called bhang." It seems that "no charas is prepared in Central India except a little in the Bhopawar Agency for the personal use of the cultivators, or for presents from them to religious mendicants." The method of preparation is thus described by the Politi- cal Agent of Bhopawar: "Charas is prepared by rubbing ganja (sometimes mixed with bhang) violently for several hours on rough woollen blankets, which after- wards are scraped with a knife. The substance thus scraped off is first class charas. An inferior kind is then obtained by washing the blanket with the least possible amount of water, and then evaporating the liquid." The report of Gopal Ram at the close of the North-Western Provinces memorandum con- tains no information of special interest regarding the preparation of the drugs in Gwalior except that relating to charas as a bye-product of ganja cultivation. "A certain amount of charas is obtained in this (Gwalior) State by scraping off the resin which adheres to the hands in cutting the ganja plant. In tahsil Antri cultivators do not care much about the charas. In tahsil Kolarus, district Narwar, I hear charas is obtained in small quantities by the same process as in Kumaon and Garhwal." 26

It is of the same kind and prepared by the same processes as are found in the Gujarat Division of the Bombay Presidency. Kashmir. 271. The Governor of Jammu reports that neither ganja nor charas are made there, but only bhang. The Governor of Kashmir gives an account in which the names of the three drugs are confused. He says first: "Almost all wild hemp, which is called taliain the Punjab, and is generally female plant in the above-mentioned tahsils, is used for the preparation of ganja locally known by name gard bhang (chura charas)." And further onCH. VI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 103 through the Punjab. Mr. Stoker reports that some of it passes into British Kumaon and Garhwal. Summary. 273. It will be seen from the above detailed description that bhang, whether produced by the cultivated or wild plant, is prepared by simple drying. The processes by which ganja is prepared consist of pressing, drying, and removal of leaf. The manufacture is most perfect in Bengal. In other provinces it is not characterized by the same degree of care, and one or other of the three essential features of the manufacture is more or less neglected. Ganja collected from the wild plant and from the bhang crops of Sind, and probably also that yielded by stray cultivation, is simply dried. There are only two methods of preparing charas which appear to be used when the drug is produced on any considerable scale, viz., that by rubbing the flower heads with the hands as in Kumaon and Nepal, and that described as being practised in Yarkand, which may be called the garda method, and consists in beating the plant over cloth, and manipulating the dust that is thus deposited. The collection of the resin adhering to hands and implements in the course of harvest- ing ganja is worth remembering, for it is proved in Gwalior and Bombay. The prac- tice of the Malwa Bhils is perhaps established. Other methods are unimportant, and the common report that charas is collected by men dressed in leather moving about in the hemp crops has not been definitely located. It is doubtful if this device is employed anywhere in India. The results of the analyses of various samples of the drugs, which have been prepared at the request of the Commission, are shown in Vol. III Appendices. Deterioration of hemp drugs. 274. Regarding the question whether hemp drugs deteriorate or not by keeping, the Commission, for reasons which will be explained later, are unable to state definitely the precise period for which the drugs will retain unimpaired their full narcotic power under ordinary conditions of storage. A large number of witnesses have tendered evidence rela- tive to the question whether hemp drugs deteriorate or not by keeping. The general tenor of the evidence is to the effect that the fresher the drugs, the better. Regard- ing ganja, Mr. K. G. Gupta, Excise Commissioner, Bengal, states that the drug is "much valued during the first year; less so in two years104 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VI. Regarding the keeping properties of charas, the information must necessa- rily be inexact, as it is an imported article, and it is practically impossible for the real age of any particular sample to be known. From its physical properties charas admits of being readily adulterated, and the strikingly marked differences in the physiological value of charas resin as determined by Dr. Evans would also appear to support this view. From the various modes which appear to be adopt- ed for the preparation of commercial charas, it must always be a drug of more or less uncertain composition, and not undeserving of the appellation106 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VI. in the form of tabloids lessens deterioration by exposing a smaller surface to the action of damp and air. The proposed system would also lessen very materially the bulk to be stored and facilitate transport. It would most certainly prevent to a great extent volatilization of the essential oil on which so much of the popu- lar commercial value of the drug depends, and it would also to a great extent prevent the illicit drug from passing into the market.
CHAPTER VII. TRADE AND MOVEMENT OF THE HEMP DRUGS. Bengal. 278. The area cultivated in the Ganja Mahal in the year 1892-93 was much greater than in any one of the preceding 19 years, being, 3,540 bighas (Excise Commissioner's Memo- randum), equivalent to 1,180 acres. But the estimated outturn of the crop was comparatively small, being only 7,575 maunds, and not much above the average of the five years from 1888-89 to 1892-93, 7,317 maunds (Excise Report for 1892-93, page 36). For the purpose of examining the movements of the pro- duce, therefore, 1892-93 is a fair average year. Exports of ganja. 279. Bengal exports ganja by land to Assam, Kuch Behar, Nepal, and the North-Western Provinces, and by sea to London, British Indian ports, and places outside India. The figures for 1892-93 are108 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VII. very far below the quantity they used to buy in Rajshahi, and it is clear that the North-Western Provinces have found other sources of supply to meet their wants. Imports of ganja. 281. A certain amount of ganja is imported under license from the Tributary States of Orissa, but the Commissioner of Excise reports that the quantity is not large, as little advantage has yet been taken of the rules passed in March 1892 to legalize the import. For the previous decade the importation had been entirely forbidden under orders of the 21st June 1882. Smuggling from the States is, however, carried on on a considerable scale. This and a small amount of illicit import over the Nepal frontier are practically the only sources of the ganja supply of the province besides the produce of the Ganja Mahal and such material for smoking as the wild growth and illicit cultivation provide. It may be noted that in the year 1878-79 a small amount of ganja was imported from Bombay and the Central Provinces. The experiment has not been repeated. Bhang and charas. 282. The Excise Commissioner reports that bhang is not as a rule imported from any other province, and no figures are furnish- ed. But the Excise Commissioner, North-Western Provinces, states that a certain amount does pass from his province into Bengal, and there is general corroboration of this statement in the evidence. Charas is imported from the Punjab. Formerly, it seems Nepal charas was generally con- sumed, but it never could have been largely imported, for the total import for the year 1880-81 was less than half a maund. The trade in charas seems now to be steadily growing. A duty of Rs. 8 a sr has been levied on the drug since 1880, and the import is now 11 maunds. Kuch Behar. 283. The Kuch Behar State imported 89 maunds of ganja in the year 1892- 93. Though somewhat higher than that of the three preceding years, the figure is not abnormal. It exports none of the hemp drugs, and none are licitly produced. The Tributary States of Orissa. 284. Though the Bengal Government has passed regulations under which the drugs can be exported from the Garhjat States, and though there is considerable demand for them, there is practically no licit trade. The illegal traffic is considerable, but its volume cannot be estimated. Within the States the consumers appear to grow their own drugs, and there is no organised trade. Political States of Chota NagPur. 285. There is no trade worth mention in the Chota Nagpur States. All the States probably import ganja to a certain extent, for cultivation has been more or less restricted in all of them; but there is definite information to this effect from Seraikela and Kharsa- wan alone. The former State has furnished statistics in the form prescribed by the Commission showing an import of 1 maunds of ganja. It is nevertheless probable that many consumers grow their own drugs. There are no exports of the drugs except perhaps in the shape of very petty smuggling. Hill Tippera. 286. There is no trade in the drugs in Hill Tippera. An insignificant amount is imported for consumption, and there is some petty smuggling into British territory towards Bengal and Assam.
CH. VII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 109 Assam. 287. Assam draws its ganja supply from Rajshahi. The figures of import are given from 1879-80 to 1892-93. The average import of the first four years of this period was 644 maunds, of the next five years 677 maunds, and of the last five years 750 maunds. The trade therefore is growing, and the increase is doubtless connected with the development of the tea industry in Assam and the influx of coolies attending it. The drug is not exported. There is reason to suppose that the consumption of licit ganja, and therefore the import trade, is affected by the smuggling of inferior ganja from the hill countries and by the existence in the valleys of the wild growth in considerable abundance; but it is not possible to form any estimate of the extent of this interference with the legitimate business. Charas is not consumed. Licenses are not issued for the import of bhang probably because there is no demand for Bengal bhang, the local weed being far more than suffi- cient for the needs of the province. Nor is there any local trade in bhang. Practically bhang is not recognized as a distinct article from ganja. There is very little information about its use. North-Western Provinces. 288. The province produces for itself a large amount of bhang and a very small amount of ganja and charas. A considerable quantity of bhang is nevertheless imported, and practically the whole of the ganja and charas consumed are from outside the province. All three drugs also pass out of the province, but ganja and charas only to a small extent. Ganja imports. 289. Mr. Stoker writes that the three main localities from which ganja is im- ported are Bengal, Khandwa, and Central India, i.e.,(a) Gwalior, and (b) Bundelkhand Native States. The Bengal Excise Report for 1892-93 shows that the export from Bengal to the North-Western Provinces in the last three years has been110 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VII. The Bengal drug, baluchar, is universally admitted to be of superior quality. Mr. Stoker writes: "The appearance would indicate that it contains more of the resinous secretion; but, so far as I know, it seems to be preferred on ac- count of its flavour and less unpleasant after effects." It was exported to the North-Western Provinces in 1854-55 to the amount of 6,036 maunds, and in 1861CH. VII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMPP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. III demand in spite of its much higher price. The name pathar, pathiyara, or pathiyala may possibly be derived, Mr. Stoker thinks, from the leafy character of the inferior drug. Other sources of ganja supply. 292. It is mentioned that within the last ten years ganja has been imported from Holkar's Territory, Berar, Mewar, Nasik, Nasirabad, and Khandesh, and perhaps other places in the Bombay Presidency; but latterly "the proximity of Khandwa and Gwalior, and the cheapness of the drug there, seem to have given them a monopoly of the business in pathar." The smuggling of inferior ganja from over the Nepal frontier is too insignificant to interfere with the trade. The registered exports are not considerable; some imported ganja goes from Bahraich into Nepal. Import of charas. 293. The charas used in the North-Western Provinces is almost wholly the produce of Yarkand and Bokhara obtained through the Punjab. Nepal also supplies from 25 to 50 maunds. The total import is given as 2,251 maunds. This is far in excess of any previous record, but Mr. Stoker advises caution against placing too great reliance on these statistics, and states that he has only recently established a system of registration which can be expected to give at all accurate results. The figure is probably unduly enhanced by the partial registration of transports within the prov- ince. In such registration the district exports must have failed to appear, for the total export of the year is only given at 45 maunds. In the correspondence of 1881 the Board of Revenue estimated the consumption at only 1,000 maunds, and it cannot be supposed that it has doubled since that time. Mr. Stoker's estimate of the imports, viz., 1,100 or 1,200 maunds, may be adopted. Some interesting information is furnished in a letter of the British Joint Commissioner of Ladakh which appears in the correspondence of 1881. That officer states that the charas which comes into India by the Ladakh road is produced in East- ern Turkestan, viz., Yarkand, Yengi Hissar, Kashgar, Khotan, etc. This is regarded as inferior to the charas of Bokhara, which is carried through Kabul to Peshawar, and through Kandahar (in ordinary times) to Shikarpur in Sind. The charas of Yengi Hissar, which is the best of the kinds produced in Eastern Turkestan, is frequently sent through Khokand to Bokhara, and thence imported with Bokhara charas, and sold under that name. The great bulk of the charas sent through Ladakh to India is consigned to Amritsar. Amritsar is the chief dept of charas, and the North-Western Provinces supply would seem to be drawn from that place. The traders have informed Mr. Stoker that the drug is much less pure than it used to be some years ago, and also much cheaper. The Shh- jahani or Saljahni charas from Nepal is of very superior quality, and commands as high a price as Rs. 10 a sr. It seems all to go to Lucknow, where it is retail- ed at Rs. 35 to Rs. 40 per sr. The import has fallen off in late years in conse- quence of Yarkand charas having become cheaper, but its superior quality still secures a market for it. Charas produced in the Himalayas. 294. Charas is manufactured to the extent of about 50 maunds in the mountains of Kumaon and Garhwal from the crops cultivated for fibre. It is for the most part consumed locally, but 5 or 6 maunds pass annually into the hands of the con- tractors. It would appear that a small amount is exported to Tibet. This
112 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VII. district also receives small imports from Tibet and Nepal. It is said that the people prefer Yarkand charas to their own, and Mr. Stoker cannot understand in what, except cheapness, the superiority of the latter can consist, for the home produce must be far the purer of the two. Some charas is prepared from the wild growth, but it is doubtful if it enters the market. It may, however, affect the trade by satisfying the wants of a certain class of consumers. There is still another source of charas in the province, though it is not yet drawn upon except by the hillmen who come down to cultivate in the Kumaon Terai and the Bhabar. The wild growth of this region is made to yield the drug of which Mr. Stoker had succeeded in getting a specimen. The quantity made and used is quite insignificant, and does not appear to find its way into the market; but the possibility of preparing the drug from the wild growth of the low country is interesting. Export of charas. 295. The export of charas is only 45 maunds. It probably passes into Bengal and the Native States on the southern fron- tier; but there is no definite information. The figure may not mean exports from the province, but it is reasonable to expect that there should be a little trade in the directions indicated. Import and export of bhang. 296. The imports and exports of bhang are given as 1,644 and 1,263 maunds respectively. It may be doubted if these figures have any value at all as representing the volume of trade over the frontiers of the province. The mass of the bhang trade of course circulates within the province, and consists in providing the locally grown drug to local consumers. Regarding the external trade, Mr. Stoker writes: "A certain amount is imported from the Punjab, coming chiefly from Jagadhri, Kalsia, and Umballa, and some from Amritsar and Hoshiarpur. Nearly all of it goes to a few of our western districts. This is not because of any failure in the local supply, which is unlimited and inexhaustible, nor because of any superiority of the Punjab article, but apparently on account of the trade connection of some of the contractors with the Punjab............. A little bhang also comes from Bhartpur and Jeypore, and perhaps from a few Bundelkhand Native States; but in that direction we give more than we get. The amount is not considerable, and seems to be diminishing. Some of the bhang from Gonda and Bahraich is really grown on the Nepal side of the border...................... A certain amount of bhang finds its way out of the provinces to the neighbouring districts of Bengal, the Punjab, the Central Provinces, and the Bundelkhand States." It appears that the contractors often buy the plant from the owners or occupiers of land who have collected and stored it. The purchase money would seem to include a price for the drug itself as well as payment of the expenses connected with collecting and storing it. Rampur. 297. There is no separate information regarding the trade arrangements of the Rampur State. They form part of the general trade of the province. The amount of the State's imports and exports cannot appreciably affect the course of the latter. Tehri Garhwal. 298. The same remarks apply to the Hill State of Tehri Garhwal, with the addition of the definite information that none of the products of the hemp cultivation carried on in the State passes over its frontiers into British territory.
CH. VII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 113 Punjab. 299. The comparatively unimportant subject of the bhang trade may be disposed of in a few words. The mass of the bhang consumed is collected within the province mostly from the wild growth. There is a considerable import from over the Kashmir frontier which, the Excise Commissioner remarks, may be regarded as local production, for the plant is collected at no great distance from the border. There is a small import from the direction of Kabul also. It has been seen that a certain quantity of bhang passes out into the North-Western Provinces. It is probable that the bhang produced from cultivation is mostly consumed at home, and that very little of it, if any, passes on to the market. The amount shown as sold by retail vendors approaches 4,000 maunds. Import of charas. 300. Nearly the whole of the charas supply of India comes through the Punjab. The Excise Commissioner estimates that in 1892-93 the total import amounted to 5,000 maunds; that this was an exceptional year, and that in ordinary years it is between 3,000 and 4,000 maunds. When examining the trade of the North- Western Provinces, information was quoted from the Joint Commissioner, Ladakh, about the kinds of charas which pass under the names of Bokhara and Yarkand, and the routes by which the two articles are imported into India. The Joint Commissioner, in this case Captain Ramsay, reported to the Financial Commis- sioner, Punjab, in August 1888, on the subject of the charas trade. In this report he writes: " Charas is produced chiefly in the vicinity of Yarkand. It grows at Bokhara and other places in Turkestan, but I have been informed that the Russians have prohibited its cultivation within their dominions, and that supplies of the drug are now obtained almost entirely from Yarkand territory. The finest charas does not find its way into Ladakh, but is exported to Bokhara and other places." He proceeds to give some interesting details of the trade: " The reported value of the charas is fictitious for this reason that the Yarkandis bring their charas to Leh, and there meet Indian traders who take their charas in exchange for piece-goods and other Indian articles. Each party over-values his goods, hence the reputed value of both charas and piece-goods, etc., is from 10 to 20 per cent. in excess of the real value." He then shows that the trade has a strong spice of gambling about it: "It will be observed that the fluctuations in the price of charas are very great, and this fact has led two of my predecessors and myself to express opinions hostile to the fostering of this particular branch of our Central Asian trade on the ground that all charas dealings partake rather of the nature of a gambling transaction than of legitimate trade. The price fixed for charas at Leh is almost entirely speculative. The charas is intended for sale in the Punjab, but none but license-holders are permitted to sell charas there; the consequence is that when merchants take their charas to the Punjab, they are obliged to sell it for such price as the license-holders will pay. The charas cannot be kept in India, as it goes bad after a year, and it cannot be taken back on account of the cost of transport. The down country license- holder is therefore in a position to fix the price of the drug. Nevertheless large profits are sometimes made on charas taken down for sale, and thus the trade continues to thrive." These remarks appear to be just, though it may not be correct to say that charas goes bad in quite so short a time as one year. The charas having arrived at Leh, and having apparently passed into the hands of Indian traders, is taken to the Punjab by two routes, via Kashmir and vi Kulu. 29

The ganja, gard bhang, or chura charas manufactured in Kashmir is all consumed locally; none is exported to the Punjab (Kashmir Governor's Memo- randum). The Kashmir authorities take precautions to see that the Yarkand charas passes through with bulk unbroken, and they levy duty on any that may be sold in Srinagar. The import by this route may be roughly stated at 500. maunds. Six or seven times as much is imported direct through Kulu to Hoshiarpur, and during the last three years the amount has grown considerably. The figures for the last three years areCH.

These estimates must take account of a great deal of material that does not find its way on to the books of the Khandwa dept. For paragraph 54 of the Excise Memorandum gives figures which would put the outturn at hardly 10 maunds. The quantity of ganja brought to store and the quantity exported since 1888-89 are given in that paragraph as follows:116 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VII. its being used by the hemp cultivators of Hyderabad, the Berars, Bombay, andIndore. There is some smuggling of ganja from the Native States on the borders of the province, but it does not seem to be considerable enough to materially affect the licensed trade. Bhang is imported from Central India to the extent of about 10 maunds for the use principally of Marwari traders. It is difficult to believe that the leaves of the hemp cultivated at Khandwa and the fragments from ganja manufacture do not pass into use as bhang; but there is no evidence that they do. The Excise Commissioner thinks that the high maximum (20 tolas) for legal possession of bhang affects the licensed import by enabling consumers who travel to bring in the drug for themselves. "Considerable quantities," he says, "are introduced by post also." Feudatory States, | Central Prov- inces. 305. The Feudatory States and some zamindaris administer their own excise. These are all under engagement to buy their ganja from British wholesale vendors. Their imports are steadily growing, and amounted in 1892-93 to 273 maunds (paragraph 66, Excise Memorandum). Khairagarh and Sonepur alone have sent reports, and they show that their imports are increasing, and are now over 20 maunds each. None of them apparently exports any ganja, though from the position of some of them on the frontier, and the presumably superior quality of Khandwa ganja over that of ganja yielded by ruder methods of cultivation, they might have been expected to do so. But the Native States and Madras zamindaris beyond the frontier all more or less grow their own ganja, and the Dewan of the Sonepur State says that the locally grown article is preferred. There may, however, be some petty export to the Chota Nagpur States, for the British authorities of that divi- sion have succeeded in restricting cultivation in them. Madras. 306. The Excise memorandum and the statistics give no information about the imports and exports of ganja or the quantity pro- duced in the Presidency. Of the other forms of the raw drugs, charas does not appear to be used, and bhang is but rarely recog- nised as a distinct article from ganja. Of these, therefore, nothing need be said in the present connection. Probable amount of ganja pro- duced. 307. In order to form an idea of the extent of the traffic in ganja, it is necessary to hazard an estimate of the outturn of the cultiva- tion throughout the Presidency. The area has been estimated at 350 acres of regular cultivation, to which must be added the cultiva- tion of the homestead and desultory kind. The Bengal Excise Report of 1892-93, page 36, gives the average outturn per bigha as 31/5 maunds, or something less than 10 maunds an acre. In the Central Provinces it appeared to be much the same figure. Mr. Benson, when giving evidence orally, said that the people of North Arcot and Kistna had both told him that the crop came out about 420 lbs., or 51/4 maunds to the acre, but he had not been able to test the statement. Except the fact that a higher outturn is got in the Ganja Mahal and at Khandwa, there is no apparent reason why this should be regarded as an unduly low estimate. For the reason stated, however, it may be raised to 6 maunds. And it will be proper to add one maund for the fragments from the manufacture which go to make bhang. The 350 acres of regular cultivation would at this rate, 7 maunds per acre, yield 2,450 maunds. The less systematic cultivation, accompanied by
CH. VII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 117 probably less skilful manufacture, may perhaps be estimated to yield 2,000 maunds. The total outturn would thus be 4,450 maunds. 308. There is definite information of the following exports in 1892-93:118 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VII. of these figures is 61/2 maunds. On the average of the last five years, the culti- vation of the Deccan and Southern Maratha Country, including the Native States, is about 1,100 acres, which at the above rate would yield 7,150 maunds of ganja. The cultivation in the other parts of the Presidency proper is insig- nificant, and yields only bhang. The whole of the Presidency, including Cutch, Kathiawar, and the other Political Agencies, draws its ganja supply from the Deccan. Baroda also comes to the same market, and so do Sind and Aden. Statistics of sale unreliable. Estimate of consumption. 311. The registered retail sale of the British districts (excluding Sind) is on the five years average 2,120 maunds. This ought to be near the amount of actual consumption, for im- ports of ganja are compared with the passes on arrival of consignments at the district head-quarters, the taluka, or the village, and the accounts of the retail vendors and their stocks are inspected from time to time by the District and Abkari Officers (Excise Memorandum, paragraph 8). The Commissioner of Customs, Salt, Opium, and Abkari states also (paragraph 14, Excise Memorandum) that the reports from all districts are unanimous that smuggling of these drugs is to all intents and purposes unknown, and he explains why it should not be worth the people's while to engage in illicit practices. But unfortunately it is found on examining the district figures that the provincial total is got simply by adding them up, and that in no less than nine districts there is no registered sale whatever in the year 1892-93. Large districts like Dharwar and Satara are thus imperfectly represented, and the average is falsified by the fact that in other districts the figures for the full quinquennium are not brought into the account. The actual average consumption is evidently very much in excess of 2,120 maunds. Another large addition must be made to the recorded sale on account of the waste which accompanies the handling and distribution of the less highly manufactured ganja found outside Bengal. With these corrections the con- sumption of British districts alone will account for not less than 3,000 maunds of the total production. Ganja supplied to Native States. 312. A few States and some of the Agencies have sent figures of imports and consumption which exceed a total of 1,000 maunds. Only one State of Kathiawar is represented in this listCH.

It will be seen from the following statement that there is a consider- able export of ganja by sea. Something less than one-half of the whole goes to British Indian ports, several of which are probably in the Bombay Presidency. A little more than a quarter finds its way to foreign Indian ports, which would include those of Cutch and Kathiawar. There is not, however, any definite information of the Indian ports, British and foreign, to which the drug is carried. As much of the drug as is imported into the Presidency and its Native States has, of course, been included in the above survey of import and consumption. About 28 per cent. goes to Aden, Arabia, Africa, and Europe. The export to London is very con- siderable. There is no reason to suppose that any of the sea export consists of other than Bombay ganja.

The result of this survey of the distribution of the ganja produced in the Bombay Presidency is as follows:120 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VII. Bhang. 316. Bhang occupies such a position in relation to ganja in the Bombay Presi- dency that it is hardly possible to examine the traffic in it separately. In the Northern Division the cultivation may yield 150 maunds, which would not be more than sufficient to supply the local demand. The bhang produced in Baroda, a very small amount, is not exported. The bhang which generally passes by that name consists of the fragments of leaves and flower head which come away in the manufacture of ganja. If figures had been complete and trustworthy, ganja and bhang might have been put together, and treated as one article of trade. It did not appear advisable to deal thus with a total consumption of only 44 maunds in the year 1892-93, a figure which a comparison with previous years shows to be incorrect. It does not appear that the sale of bhang as a distinct article from ganja exceeds 150 maunds a year in the whole Presidency, excluding Sind. The sale is only registered in the Northern Division and in Khandesh. Mr. Almon states that some of the Surat bhang finds its way to Bombay, and Mr. Campbell mentions import from Palanpur. Charas. 317. Charas is only used in Bombay City to the extent of 7 or 8 maunds a year. Seven srs only were sold in Poona for the first time in 1892-93. The drug is imported from Amritsar and Hoshiarpur. Bombay States. 318. The information is not complete enough to make it worth while to examine the individual trade of the Native States. The above general survey of the Presidency supplies the broad fact that all the States get their supply of ganja from the Bombay cultivation. The States in the extreme north of the Presidency, especially Palan- pur, grow a little bhang for themselves, and this State may export some of its own growth to Bombay; but it cannot be much. Some of the southern States probably export part of the produce of the cultivation mentioned in Chapter IV. Sind. 319. In Sind bhang takes the place of first importance among the three hemp drugs. Cultivation for the production of this drug amounts to 262 acres on the average of the last five years. The outturn calculated at something under 12 maunds an acre is 3,000 maunds. A high rate is adopted because the whole crop, except the actual sticks, goes into the product. The Excise Reports of 1891-92 and 1892-93 show the sources from which the various districts of Sind get their supplies of the drugs. All the districts, except the Upper Sind Frontier, would appear to consume locally grown bhang. The retail sale on the average of the last five years is 4,539 maunds, so the local production does not cover the consump- tion. But it is possible that this figure includes transport within the province. The Upper Sind Frontier district would appear to import the drug from the Punjab and Khelat. The statement regarding Khelat may be doubted, for there is very little cultivation there according to the information furnished to the Com- mission. Import of ganja. 320. The imports of ganja average 55 maunds, and the retail sale 22 maunds. It is mostly brought through Karachi from Panvel in the Kolaba district of the Bombay Presidency, where there is a wholesale business carried on in the ganja grown in the Deccan.
CH. VII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 121 Some little may be imported from Cutch, but that also is in all probability the same ganja moving by a different route. The districts of Karachi and the Upper Sind Frontier would appear from the statistics to consume none of it, and Shikarpur very little; but the registration of the sale in Karachi is obviously imperfect. It was to be expected that the districts of Upper Sind should in respect to the consumption of ganja resemble the Punjab, where the drug is not smoked. Import of charas. 321. The average import of charas is 70 maunds, and the registered retail sale 24 maunds. Amritsar seems to be the source of supply. Though the drug is said to be brought from Afghanistan, Yarkand, and Khorassan, there is no information of any direct import over the Sind Frontier on the west. The Karachi figures of retail sale are again wanting, and the drug would appear to be little used in Thar and Parkar. But the latter district appears to be more addicted to opium. The Acting Commissioner in Sind (Colonel Crawford) suspects some smuggling of charas and ganja from Jaisalmir through Thar and Parkar, and some illicit import of bhang from Khairpur into surrounding districts. Neither traffic appears to be at all extensive. In the last two years there has been a trifling export of 10 maunds of ganja by sea from Karachi. Khairpur. 322. The Khairpur State grows 84 acres of bhang, which would yield about 1,000 maunds. The registered retail sale was three and four years ago 1,800 and 1,500 maunds; it is entered at 276 maunds for 1892-93. The figures cannot be correct. The statis- tics give no imports of ganja or charas, or any consumption of these drugs. Nor is there any record of export of bhang in the last three years. It is probable that some charas is used, but it may well be that ganja is but rarely smoked. Berar. 323. The average area of cultivation in Berar is 60 acres, which by the Khandwa standard would yield something over 500 maunds of ganja. The imports, which come from Khandwa and some from Khandesh, are estimated at 800 maunds (Excise Memorandum). These supplies "are apparently sufficient for the requirements of the people who indulge in this drug." No exports are recorded, and it is stated that there are none. The cultivation in Khandesh has become so reduced that it is doubtful if any ganja comes from that district now. Charas does not appear to be used, and no sale of bhang distinct from ganja is recorded. Ajmere. 324. The statistics of Ajmere give no figures of import, export, or retail sale. Very little of the hemp drugs is produced locally, and that only in the form of bhang. It is therefore safe to say there is no export. The Assistant Commissioner and Collector of Excise Revenue reports that ganja and charas are imported usually from the Punjab. This is probably true of charas, but the Punjab produces no ganja, and this drug must come from elsewhere, Gwalior being the most convenient, and therefore the most probable, source of supply. Coorg. 325. In Coorg there is practically no local production of the hemp drugs. The average import of ganja from the figures of two years is 74 maunds of 28 lbs. each, or 21 Indian 31
122 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VII. maunds. The average of registered consumption is two-thirds of this amount. The drug imported would seem to be grown in the Madras Presidency. Charas is not used, nor is bhang regarded as a distinct article from ganja. Baluchistan. 326. The information from Baluchistan does not enable the Commission to judge of the extent of the trade in the province. The farms in two divisionsCH. VII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 123 cultivation extends to between 300 and 400 acres. The Director of Agriculture states that the outturn may be taken to be 5 or 6 maunds per acre. The total produce of the State would then be about 2,000 maunds. The memorandum states that the local production is sufficient to meet the requirements of the people in ordinary seasons. It is only in abnormal years that exports to, or imports from, British territory take place. The average of these for the last five years is 75 maunds of import and 10 maunds of export. Rajputana. 330. The Rajputana States appear to grow most of the bhang they require, and to import ganja and charas. The trade in charas is mostly in the hands of travelling Kabulis, called in these parts Vilayatis; but bhang and ganja are transported by the local traders of all grades, from Marwaris in a large way of business to Tambolis (pan sellers) and grocers. The following facts about the trade in some of the States are re-ported:124 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VII. Kerowli.CH.

The traffic in charas from Leh through Srinagar has been noticed in connection with the Punjab imports. It would seem that the goods do not ordinarily change hands or break bulk in Kashmir. Nepal. 334. The exports from Nepal into the North-West Provinces have been noticed. It is probable that a small amount of Nepal charas still finds its way to Calcutta. There may be a little smuggling of ganja into Bengal, but it cannot be important. On the other hand, the Bengal statistics show that Nepal took in 1892-93 177 maunds of Bengal ganja.
CHAPTER VIII. EXTENT OF USE AND THE MANNER AND FORMS IN WHICH THE HEMP DRUGS ARE CONSUMED. Bengal. Quality of statistics. 335. In endeavouring to measure the extent to which the hemp drugs are used, it will be best to deal with them in their simplest forms of ganja, bhang, and charas. The excise administration of the hemp drugs in Bengal is so systematic that the statistics of registered sale to retail vendors may be accepted as correct; and with regard to ganja and charas, they will be found to afford a very good indication of the actual consumption. With bhang the case is different, for most of this drug which is consumed outside the big cities escapes excise altogether. And the cities in which it can with any approach to truth be said that unexcised bhang is not consumed are very few. Ganja is the most important of the three drugs; it contributes nearly the whole of the hemp drug revenue, and is consumed in all parts of the province. In the case of Bengal it is possible to form with the help of the statistics a fairly accurate idea of the extent to which the use of it prevails in the various divisions and districts. On this subject a statement appears in the Excise Report for 1892-93: "Its consumption is largest in Calcutta, and next in Mymensingh and Dacca; it is also considerable in the 24-Parganas, Rangpur, Pabna, Tippera, Cuttack, Puri, and the districts of Behar"; and the qualification is added that the large apparent consumption in Behar is to be explained to some extent by export to the North-Western Provinces. Consumption compared with population of ganja. 336. If the quantity sold in each division and district be compared with their population, it will be found that the divisions rank as fol- lows (the figures of 1892-93 are taken)128 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VIII. Mymensingh 1 maund to 8,000 Shahabad " " 9,000 Monghyr " " 9,000 Bhagalpur " " 8,000 Purnea " " 9,000 Puri " " 10,000 Consumption of ganja in Calcutta. 337. The circumstances of Calcutta are of course altogether abnormal. It contains a vast number of coolies and day labourers, and workers in boats and on the river-side, besides a large foreign population, many of whom, such as domestic servants, porters, and watchmen attached to Government offices, to houses of business, and to private persons, and the followers of wealthy people, are notoriously addicted to the hemp drugs in one form or other. There are also present in the city all the conditions which tend to luxury and excess. The evidence shows that the use of ganja by some of the well-to-do classes is by no means rare, and the probability is that with people who have acquired the taste and can afford to gratify it freely the indulgence is not stinted either to themselves or their friends. Calcutta, therefore, not only contains amongst its population an unusually high proportion of consumers, but the consumers also take considerably more than the average individual allowance. Consumption of ganja in the districts. 338. The districts where the consumption is highest come far behind the city of Calcutta. The favour in which the drug is held in the 24-Parganas is probably due in great measure to the neighbourhood of Calcutta; but it is also in evidence that the inhabitants of low and swampy tracts and the river population are specially addicted to it. Similar reasons, Dacca being a large city, may account for the high consump- tion of the districts of Dacca and Mymensingh. The shops in Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Shahabad, Monghyr, Bhagalpur, and Purnea very probably get a good deal of their custom, besides the recorded export, from beyond the frontiers of Bengal. Puri is a great resort of religious mendicants and similar people who are the most determined consumers of ganja. In other directions it is difficult to account for the great difference in the rate of consumption, as shown by the retail sales, in districts which adjoin one another, and in which very similar physical and economic conditions apparently prevail. Why, for instance, should Dinajpur be abstemious, lying as it does in the midst of districts which all show a full average consumption? It may be due to the absence of large rivers and of riverside population. But this explanation will not apply to Noakhali, which shows the smallest sale in the whole province, and is situated between Tippera and Chittagong, the former of which the Excise Commis- sioner regards as a district of heavy consumption, and the latter being not very exceptional in this respect. The consumption of opium and liquor is also very low in Noakhali. Tracts in which different degrees of use prevail of ganja. 339. The figures of retail sale mark off large continuous tracts, which can be distinguished from one another by their degrees of consumption, though it may not be easy to ac- count for the differences between them. Thus the consumption is consistently
CH. VIII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 129 low throughout the four hill districts of the Chota Nagpur Division, the com- paratively high rate of Lohardaga being due in all probability to the fact that Ranchi, the head-quarters of the division, has a considerable population of foreigners. Manbhum in the Chota Nagpur Division, Bankura and Midna- pur in the Burdwan Division, and Balasore in Orissa form the skirt of the south- western hill tract, and are content with one maund of ganja for every 25,000 of the population. There is probably a certain amount of smuggling from the Hill States into these districts, but it can hardly be sufficient to affect their character as ganja consumers in the comparison now being made. North- east and east of Calcutta lies a huge tract of low consumption, comprising the districts of Noakhali, Khulna, Jessore, Nadia, Backergunge, and Faridpur. This fact hardly bears out the theory that residence in low-lying country and river-side life are very intimately connected with the ganja habit. In the districts situated immediately west and north-west of Calcutta, and in the Rajshahi Division and in Malda, the consumption is about average. Further west, in the Patna Division, the consumption falls off. Area of heavier consumption of ganja marked off. 340. The province might possibly be divided into two portions so as to indi- cate consumption above and below the average. A straight line drawn from Monghyr on the Ganges to Raipura on the Megna in the Noakhali district, and turned north and east at the respective ends direct to the frontiers of the province, would mark off broadly the portion in which consumption exceeds one maund to 15,000 of the population. It would include all the river population on the Ganges and Brahmaputra between the two places named. South and west of this line there would be found only Calcutta, the 24-Parganas, and Puri with consumption exceeding the above figure. Incidence of consumption in the whole population. 341. The consumption of the whole province, including Calcutta, is one maund to 13,000 of the population, and excluding Calcutta one maund to 14,000. This maund con- sists of the drug as issued from the local golas, while the figures of consumption given by witnesses represent the quantity of the detached pieces of ganja as they are manipulated for use. Allowing for the waste between the gola and the chillum, it will be fair to put the consumption at one maund to 16,000 of the population. Individual consumption of ganja. 342. The Excise Commissioner reports that the average retail price of ganja is Rs. 20 per sr. It ranges from Rs. 12 in Calcutta, Patna, Cuttack, and Chittagong to above Rs. 30 in Mymensingh, or from 21/2 annas to more than 6 annas per tola, the average being 4 annas. It appears from the evidence that 1/16th of a tola is the smallest quantity that will suffice for one chillum, and that more is required if more than two or three smokers have to partake of it. That quantity apparently affords one smoke to two persons, and the refreshment seems to be generally taken twice a day. For the most moderate habitual smokers, therefore, 1/16 th of a tola may be taken as the daily allowance. This represents an expenditure of 1/4 anna a day and a yearly allowance of 23 tolas. But Mr. Gupta reports, and he is corroborated by the great bulk of the witnesses, that the average allowance is higher than this, lying between 1/4 anna and 1/2 anna per diem. Accepting this opi- nion, the daily cost to the moderate consumer may be put at 41/2 pies, and the 33

132 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VIII. Number of consumers estimated. 345. A fair average consumption for the whole province, exclusive of the Native States, is 5,000 maunds, and this suffices for 400,000 smokers at the above allowance. The number of smokers in the total population of 71,271,000 is thus something over one- half per cent. In Calcutta and the 24-Parganas together the smokers number more than 2 per cent. of the population. In the heavy consuming districts of Dacca, Mymensingh, and Bhagalpur they are about 1 per cent. In only a few other districts in the divisions of Rajshahi, Bhagalpur, Patna, and Orissa do they exceed one-half per cent. Smoking is practically confined to adult males. Assuming that these are one-quarter of the total population, the smokers do not number more than one man in 50 over the whole province. The above calcu- lation of the daily and yearly allowance does not probably err on the side of ex- cess, and it follows that the estimate of the number of consumers is rather over than under the mark. It is to be noted that Babu Hem Chunder Kerr estimated the consumption per head at 11/2 srs per annum, or three times the amount here adopted. At the average price of ganja, Rs. 20 per sr, the Commission's esti- mate of half a sr is equivalent to a yearly expenditure of Rs. 10, and it is not likely that the poor people, who form the great bulk of the consumers, could afford more than this amount. Extent of use of bhang. 346. The use of bhang does not admit of a similar survey being made, because the wild plant grows in such quantity over a large part of the province, and passes into consumption freely without the intervention of the Excise Department. Excised bhang is sold in eight out of the nine divisions, the exception being Rajshahi; but in three other divisionsCH. VIII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 133 with the Bengalis. Under these circumstances it is not worth while, even in these districts, to attempt to measure the prevalence of the habit with more exactness. Individual consumption of bhang. 348. But the evidence throws some light on the amount of individual con- sumption, and the statistics of Calcutta may prove interesting. The average total consumption of bhang in Calcutta during the last 5 years has been 440 maunds, which is about one maund to 2,000 of the population, or somewhat less than the rate of ganja consumption measure for measure. The retail price of the drug is about Rs. 21/2 or Rs. 3 per sr (memo. and witness 123). The daily allowance is very irregular. It is stated by Babu Hem Chunder Kerr that moderate use ranges from 1/2 tola to 2 tolas a day, and by others that 1/4 tola is the usual allowance, and that even this small amount is sometimes made to last for two or three days. The explanation of this irregularity is probably to be found in the facts that the drug is cheap, that it is not very potent, and large doses do not therefore produce unpleasant consequences; that the preparation of the drink is somewhat troublesome and inconvenient; and that the intermittent and occasional use as a cooling draught is common. A yearly allowance of 21/2 srs represents a daily use of little over 1/2 a tola in quantity and 1/4 anna in price134 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VIII. The proportions of the various kinds of ganja have varied considerably during these periods, but, after having attempted to estimate the effect of these variations, the Commission find that the general result is the same as that above. shown, viz., that consumption has been stationary during the last 15 years, but that the average consumption has been much less than that of the previous 5 years. The increase of population, however, during this period must not be lost sight of. It amounted to about 71/2 per cent. between 1881 and 1891, and, notwith- standing this, there was no increase in consumption during this period. In districts where the consumption has decreased, there are witnesses who say that the enhanced cost of ganja has reduced, and is reducing, the habit. Evidence is not wanting, however, to show that other causes also may have been at work to produce the result. The growing taste for liquor is one of the principal causes mentioned. This refers to the superior classes. One deposition alone (Patna District Board, 248) states that the low price of country liquor has caused a decrease in the sale of ganja among the inferior classes. This evidence, however, is contrary to the view held by the Excise Commissioner, who states in his memo- randum (paragraph 65) that liquor, even in Bihar, is much dearer than ganja. Babu Hem Chunder Kerr attributes decrease to the disrepute in which the habit is held and the belief that its effects are baneful. An Utopian zamindar, a Muhammadan, attributes the decrease to the enlargement of the peoples' minds by education, the action of temperance associations, the publication of treatises and tracts which condemn the drugs, and the spread of civilization. In the statements of witnesses who endeavour to explain the increase alleged to have occurred in their own particular districts, the following reasons for such increase are given. In exact contradiction to the evidence that the growing taste for liquor is reducing the consumption of ganja among the better classes, it is now occasionally stated that the great cost of the liquor habit and its deleteri- ous effects are making the same classes go back to ganja. Among the lower classes the raising of the price of liquor under the central distillery system is also said to be a direct encouragement to ganja. It is even stated that the example of the better classes is an encouragement to the lower, although the weight of evidence tends to show that the former are abandoning ganja. The better wages earned by the labouring classes, who are the principal consumers of ganja, is sometimes held to account for the increase. Bad seasons and consequent want of means have, it is said, brought the cheapest intoxicant into favour. As a special cause is mentioned the recent establishment of a new form of worship of Trinath in Eastern Bengal. The existence of the shops is said to be a direct incentive to consumption, but the statement of witness (202) that the officers of Government make strenuous efforts to push the sale, presumably for the sake of the revenue, was not sustained under oral examination. Some of the above reasons apply also to the increased consumption of bhang, which is far cheaper than ganja. And another very good reason is given in respect to this form of the drug, viz., the influx of up-country workers into the mills and similar industries of Calcutta and its neighbourhood. Reasons for local increase or de- crease. 351. The above analysis of the evidence gives some of the reasons alleged by individual witnesses for local increase or decrease, and indicates the various causes which have assisted or interfered with the general tendency to decrease which is manifested in the provincial statistics as a whole.
CH. VIII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 135 Kuch Behar. 352. The statistics furnished by the Kuch Behar State show an average retail sale of 76 maunds, which by the standard of the province should supply 6,000 consumers, or more than 1 per cent. of the population. The consumption seems to be stationary, though there is a gradual decrease of retail sale in the last three years. Tributary States of Chota Nag- pur and Orissa and Hill Tippera. 353. There are no means whatever of judging of the extent of use in these States. North-Western Provinces. The use of the three forms of the drug in various parts. 354. In the North-Western Provinces all three drugs136 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VIII. part of the drug consumed in the North-Western Provinces may well induce a liberal use, and this result may approximate to the truth. Individual consumption of ganja. 356. Mr. Stoker does not accept Babu Hem Chunder Kerr's estimate of average consumption per head at the high figure of 11/2 srs. At 6 annas a tola this means Rs. 45 a year, and this is obviously quite beyond the means of the consumers of average means. The individual consumption in Bengal has been estimated at half a sr, or Rs. 10 per annum. Mr. Stoker, dealing with a drug or mixed drug that costs less than baluchar, calculates the individual consumption at one sr, and the whole supply of 4,500 maunds as sufficient for 180,000 smokers. By the Bengal standard 3,500 maunds would supply 280,000 persons. It seems proper to make allowance for the cheapness of the drug and adopt the mean of the above calculations, or 230,000. This represents something less than 1/2 per cent. of the population. In the cities, baluchar sells at 6 annas a tola. It is cheaper in the villages probably because it is adulterated with pathar, which is anything from one- twelfth to one-sixth of the price of the other. If the average annual allowance of something less than one sr be regarded as being composed of 1/4 baluchar and 3/4 pathar, the cost comes to a reasonable figure. Extent of use of charas. 357. With regard to charas, Mr. Stoker estimates the individual consump- tion at half a sr per annum. For Calcutta it was put as high as one sr, because it was regarded as a luxury of the comparatively wealthy. But it does not hold that position in the North-Western Provinces. The evidence shows that it is used by the poor more than by the rich. In many places it is actually cheaper than baluchar ganja, and being stronger less of it is used at a time. It is probable that Mr. Stoker's estimate approximates to the truth, and that the 1,150 maunds imported are consumed by about 92,000 persons. The use is most common in the Meerut, Rohilkhand, and Kumaon Divisions, and decreases towards the east of the province; but it is found in all districts, except those bordering on Bundelkhand, where the consumption is trifling. The consumers are at the above figure about one-fifth per cent. of the population, and this covers an addition for the small indigenous production of Kumaon. Extent of use of bhang. 358. Bhang is not used regularly like charas and ganja. There is reason to think that a large number of the better class of Hindus take it in extremely hot weather, and that it is a regular refreshment with a very large proportion of them in the summer. There are no statistics of consumption; the drug can often be had for almost nothing from the abundant wild growth, and is always very cheap. The price of bhang seems to range from 4 annas to as much as one rupee a sr in towns, tatiabhang from Farakhabad being more expensive than commoner kinds, while baluchar ganja is Rs. 20 to Rs. 30, charas Rs. 71/2 to Rs. 25, Nepal ganja going as high as Rs. 35 and Rs. 40 a sr, and pathar ganja Rs. 21/2 to Rs. 5. Increase and decrease. 359. In the last twenty years, from 1873 to 1892, the hemp drug revenue of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh has grown from 4 to 7 lakhs. The increase in Oudh has been 193 per cent., and in the North-Western Provinces 50 per cent. It is from the figures of revenue, in the absence of statistics of retail sale, that deductions have to be made as to the rise or fall of the consumption of the drugs.
CH. VIII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 137 Connection between the use of liquor and hemp drugs. 360. Mr. Stoker connects these fluctuations in some important instances with changes in the administration of the liquor excise. He shows pretty conclusively that the hemp drug revenue has risen when the price of liquor has been raised, and that it has fallen when under the establishment of the outstill instead of the central distillery system liquor has been made more plentiful and more cheap. It is stated that the liquor revenue has in the same period grown from 17 to 32 lakhs, and that the enhanced revenue has been raised on a diminished issue of liquor. If there is this intimate relation between liquor and the hemp drugs, it seems to follow that the decreased consumption of liquor must have been accompanied by an increas- ed consumption of the hemp drugs. And to this a reasonable addition must be made on account of an increase of 5 millions in the population in the twenty years' period. There is no reason to doubt that increase of consumption assign- able to these two causes has actually occurred, for they are to all intents and purposes independent of any check or restriction arising out of the present sys- tem of hemp drug excise. The evidence shows that bhang has not got dearer; that the enhanced cost of baluchar, due to the Bengal duty, has been counteract- ed by the supply of a cheaper article; and that charas has actually been falling in price, thanks to improved communications. Increase of revenue due to im- proved administration. 361. Besides indicating the relationship between the liquor and the hemp drug habits, the figures of revenue, great though the expansion has been, do not go far to assist in ascer- taining whether the consumption of the hemp drugs has grown or not. There is the probability that the demand has increased, bringing greater profits and con- sequently more keen competition amongst the purchasers of the farms. But Mr. Stoker's remarks lead to the belief that the enhancement of the revenue has been due partly to improved management, resulting in the checking of clandestine practices, or, as he describes it, the stopping of "leakage." To judge by the instances given, losses of this sort were very considerable; and this reform, to- gether with the prevention of smuggling and illicit traffic, would go far to account for the increase. Direct testimony as to increase. 362. Turning to the evidence, there is little definite testimony of increased con- sumption, in which it is clear that the opinion is based on actual observation. There are not in this province as there are in Bengal definite statistics on which to form an opinion as to increase or decrease. The preponderance of testimony is in favour of increasing consump- tion, and the high price of liquor is more frequently alleged as the cause than anything else. Witness (20) makes a very definite statement on this point. Allied to the reason connected with liquor is found the closing of chandu and madak shops mentioned by some witnesses. Other causes given are the acces- sibility and cheapness of the drugs, the weakening of social and religious re- straints, facilities for travelling leading to the circulation of bad habits, general demoralization, and the increase of poverty and the number of sadhus and mendi- cants. It is stated by some witnesses that under Moghal rule the drugs were pro- hibited and their consumption suppressed by penalties such as whipping and mutilation, and that the present liberty has degenerated into license. On the other hand, the perversity which drives people to do what is restricted or prohibited is alleged by another as the cause of increase. Another attributes increase to ex- perience of the beneficial effects of use of the drugs. It appears that there is an 35
138 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VIII. organized movement among the Kayasths which forbids the drinking of liquor, and that these people are taking to bhang instead. Some witnesses allege that irrigation in rendering the country damp and cold makes the drugs a necessity, and one that the use of charas is increasing because the drug "is generally prepar- ed and sold (as retail dealing) by the fair sex in large towns." This last matter was taken up by the Commission, and will be noticed further on. Direct evidence of decrease. 363. But the evidence is not all on the side of increase. Some witnesses think that the consumption is stationary, and some that it is decreasing. The principal cause of decrease alleged is the change of habit among the higher classes and the better-to-do of the lower in the direction of liquor. The high cost of the drugs has, according to one or two witnesses, caused people to abandon them. Competition between ganja andcharas. 364. There is some evidence that ganja is being supplanted by charas in public favour. Mr. Wall, late Commissioner of Excise, wrote as far back as 1881: "From the large propor- tion which charas bears to other drugs in large cities like Allahabad and Benares, and from the increase in license fees for sale of charas which is noticed by the Bengal Government, it is highly probable that charas is coming into favour. It is, in fact, said that within the last few years, owing to increased duty levied on baluchar ganja in Lower Bengal, the consumption of charas has largely increased everywhere." Charas is now even cheaper as compared with Bengal ganja than it was then, and there is some evidence that the change is still going on. Rampur.Extent of use of the drugs. 365. The Revenue Member of the Rampur Council of Regency (35) states that people smoke ganja and charas everywhere in the North-Western Provinces and in the State of Rampur. Rampur, however, is situated in the Rohilkhand Divi- sion, where charas appears to be used almost exclusively. It is probable, therefore, that the statement about the use of ganja in Rampur is rather too general. This witness also alleges that the use of all three drugs is increasing because they are cheap, and they are not forbidden by the Hindu religion. Tehri Garhwal.Extent of use of the drugs. 366. The use of the drugs in Tehri Garhwal is probably as prevalent as it is in Kumaon and British Garhwal. There is no special information for the State, but from the evidence of witness (49) it may be assumed that charas is the only form of the drug used; that its use is not extensive, but possibly spread- ing through "a growing tendency to take narcotics of all kinds." Punjab. Extent of use. Charas and bhang are used, notganja. 367. In the Punjab the use of ganja disappears, the indications of its existence being found only in the statements of occasional witnesses. It has no place in the excise arrangements. Charas and bhang are used to a greater or less ex- tent in all parts of the province. Regarding bhang, the Excise Commissioner admits that a certain quantity is consumed with- out passing through the hands of the licensed vendors, but he does not think that it is very great, because the people of the parts in which the plant grows wild are not addicted to its use, while the retail price (three or four annas a sr)is so small that it is not worth while for a consumer to attempt to obtain a sup- ply elsewhere than from the nearest licensed shop. There is, however, reason to
CH. VIII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 139 believe that in the south-west corner of the province, where the use of bhang is most prevalent and cultivation is carried on to the extent of about 100 acres, aconsiderable share of the locally grown drug escapes excise. Regarding charas also, it is probable that the figures of retail sale do not represent the full con- sumption. These considerations do not, however, affect the view of compara- tive consumption of the two drugs over the province which the Excise Com- missioner has presented in his memorandum, except possibly that the consump- tion of bhang in the south-east corner may be larger than is represented. Extent of use of charas. 368. Taking charas first, it will be seen that its use is most prevalent in the Ludhiana district, and to a somewhat less degree in the Himalayan districts, and in and about the cities of Delhi, Umballa, Amritsar, Lahore, and Peshawar, and that generally the eastern half of the province has decidedly more inclination to the drug than the western half. The measure by which the two halves of the province are differentiated is a consumption of 5 ounces by 100 of population. This measure might be raised to 6 ounces on account of defective registration of sale, and expressed in the terms used for Bengal in this report as one maund to 21,500 of the population. The rate of consumption in Ludhiana is double of this, or one maund in 10,000 and in the greater part of the western half of the province is hardly more than one maund to 60,000. Individual consumption of charas. 369. In the North-Western Provinces Mr. Stoker estimated the individual con- sumption of charas at half a sr per annum. In the Punjab a somewhat higher rate might be adopted because the drug is cheaper, the price to consumers ranging from Rs. 4 to Rs. 15 per sr in this province, while in the North-Western Provinces it was Rs. 71/2 to Rs.25. If the number of consumers be taken at 60 instead of 80 to the maund, the total number for a total consumption of 1,200 maunds will be 72,000. The divisions of Delhi, Jullundur, and Lahore consume five times as much as Rawalpindi, Peshawar, and the Derajat, and there must therefore be 60,000 consumers in the former to 12,000 in the latter. In this comparison also the prov- ince falls into the same halves as before, for the consumption of the districts of Montgomery, Multan, and Jhang in the Lahore Division barely reaches 20 maunds, and does not therefore materially affect the figures. Extent of use of bhang. 370. The total retail sale of bhang on the average of the last five years is 3,800 maunds. This probably falls considerably short of the actual consumption owing to the existence of the wild growth in many districts, the regular cultivation which is carried on in the south-western districts, and the homestead cultivation which seems to prevail all over the province to a limited extent. A very appreciable supply must be got direct from these three sources without the intervention of the licensed vendors. Maunds 4,200 would represent a supply of one maund to every 5,000 of the po- pulation. The Excise Commissioner finds that the south-eastern districts have the heaviest consumption, 100 to 145 oz. to 100 of the population, or about one maund to 1,000 persons; the central districts come next with about one maund to 4,000 of the population, and the rest of the province consumes one maund to about 8,000, except that the districts of Delhi and Ludhiana almost come up to the districts of heaviest consumption.
140 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VIII. Estimate of number of bhang consumers. 371. Bhang is so cheap, 3 or 4 annas a sr, as to give very wide latitude for individual indulgence. On the other hand, a great share of the consumers, perhaps the majority, are above the class of the very poor, and the drug is to a great extent used with ingre- dients which are more or less expensive. Occasional use, either regulated by the season, or prompted by the weather, or connected with social and religious observ- ances, is also very common. These things make it extremely difficult to state any estimate of the number of consumers, though a figure of total consumption has been arrived at. It is very doubtful if more than about half of the total consumption, or 2,000 maunds, is taken by regular and habitual consumers. For such persons, at the price given above, two tolas a day, or ten srs in the year, would not be an extravagant allowance. The cost of this would be less than three rupees a year, and the ingredients would bring the expenditure up to about Rs. 10. The number of habitual consumers would thus be about 8,000. This estimate of individual consumption accords with the evidence on the particular point. The occasional consumers are many times more numerous. The description which is to follow of the "classes of consumers" and of the "social and religious customs" connected with the use of the drugs will throw more light on the extent of the occasional use of bhang. The use as a summer drink seems to be much more common in the northern parts of India, which are characterized by intense dry heat, than in the southern. The dividing line might be drawn with fair accuracy from the Runn of Cutch to Darjeeling. Increase and decrease. The evidence of the statistics. 372. The statistical table in the form prescribed by the Commission gives retail sales from the year 1875-76 to 1892-93. But in the first five of these years it is obvious that the figures include transactions other than retail sale in column 45. From 1881-82 onwards there is a steady increase in the figure for charas, interrupted only by a fall in the year 1890-91, which, however, was more than made up by the rise of the following year. In the year 1892-93 the figure is 6 maunds less than in 1891-92. As regards bhang, the figures of the whole period 1880-81 to 1892-93 do not offer any definite suggestion of increase or decrease. Their regularity might, however, tend to remove the hesitation which the Commission feel in accepting the figures for charas as a reliable index of consumption if it were not that bhang is so cheap that there can be little temptation either to smuggling outside the shops or the keeping of incorrect accounts within them. The sale of other preparations of hemp shows a steady decrease. These prepara- tions must include majum and other sweetmeats into which hemp enters. They are not very important, and it is not therefore worth while to speculate whether the decrease of sale means a real decrease of consumption or not. It would be neces- sary to proceed on mere conjecture, for the evidence and Government papers throw no light on the subject. Bhang. 373. Regarding rise or fall in the consumption of bhang also, there is little to be said. Mr. Drummond states that the use of this form of the drug is increasing in the south- eastern districts, and that caste movements against alcohol, enhanced cost of spirits, and growing prosperity among the Jats may account for it. But there is little other evidence to indicate increase, and the statistics of the Delhi Division do not suggest it. On the contrary, there is evidence that the better

The statistics of 1892-93 relied upon. 376. The figures of consumption of ganja given in paragraph 52 of the Excise Memorandum show since 1887-88 increase in every district except Hoshangabad and Narsinghpur. The decrease in these two districts is small; the increase in several districts is large. There may have been some increase in the habit in this periodCH. VIII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 143 The use of ganja compared by districts. 377. It will be seen from these figures that the area of heaviest consumption is the group of four districts, Balaghat, Seoni, Jub- bulpore, and Mandla; and among these Balaghat uses the drug at double the rate of the other three. Next in order come the districts of the Chhattisgarh Division. After these the other districts along the northern front- ier, Damoh, Saugor, Narsinghpur, and Hoshangabad, with the addition of Chhind- wara. Then follow the districts on the western and southern frontiers, Nimar, Betul, and Wardha, with Nagpur and Bhandara. And far behind comes the district of Chanda. The first two of the above groups consume the drug at a higher ratte han one maund to 10,000 of the population; the last three at less. Saugoris is included in the second group in spite of its apparently light consump- tion, because the large difference between it and the neighbouring district of Damoh in this respect confirms the evidence of illicit import given by reports and witnesses. Nagpur is placed in the fourth group in spite of its heavy sale compared with the other districts of the same group, because the consumption is to some degree foreign to the district, being connected with the troops at Kampti and other people who are attracted to the capital of the province. The high rate of consumption in Chhindwara, Seoni, Balaghat, and Mandla may probably be associated with their physical characteristics and their very malarious climate, for they cover the central highlands of the province144 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VIII. it was only that taxed ganja was substituted for untaxed and illicitly obtained ganja, the great increase would have shown itself in the earlier years after culti- vation of the ganja-bearing plant was placed under restriction, imports watched, and all illicit cultivation severely punished;" (3) the increase has occurred notwithstanding that the price of ganja has been raised to five times what it was in 1875-76; (4) as high a still-head duty as possible has been placed on liquor, and ganja is comparatively a cheap and convenient, because portable, stimulant; and (5) the excise arrangements have advertised the drug and made it popular, and supplied a superior quality of it. These arguments include nearly all that have been urged by other witnesses, except the one that with those who seek a stimulant, the hemp drugs have the advantage over liquor that they are not prohibited by the Hindu religion. But after all Mr. Neill, like the vast majority of the witnesses all over India, appears not to speak from personal observation of the use. The evidence of Colonel Doveton, Conservator of Forests, is important as bearing upon the use of ganja among the jungle tribes. He describes this as more common than formerly. It is to be regretted that more information has not been furnished to explain the extraordinary high consumption in the Balaghat district, which must have a large population of the jungle tribes, and, it may be added, the great increase of the sale in the last five years. The construction of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway must have had con- siderable effect in the consumption of the districts through which it passes east of Balaghat. Special enquiries are being made by the Central Provinces Gov- ernment regarding the increased consumption in the districts where it is most marked. Increase on the balance of evid- ence. 380. There are not wanting witnesses to assert that the use is on the decrease, and many believe that there is neither increase nor decrease. The statistics show that in ten districts there is either decrease or no very remarkable increase in the retail sale in the last five years. But the Commission, looking to the balance of evidence sup- ported by the statistics, cannot resist the conclusion that increased use accounts in some measure for the general growth of the revenue and registered con- sumption. They note that in more than one place the increase of revenue is attributed in part to the supply of a superior quality of drug. That the Khandwa drug is superior may be the case, but there is evidence that the local produce is preferred in the extreme east of the province, and it is in these regions that the greatest increase has occurred. Feudatory States. Extent of use. 381. The supply of Khandwa ganja to the Feudatory States and zamindaris has steadily increased during the last ten years from 80 maunds to 273 (paragraph 66 of Excise Memo- randum). The final figure represents a consumption by 13,650 smokers by the standard used for the calculations of the province. There is no evidence to show that the use has increased or decreased. The zamindars and feudatories had an ample supply of ganja of local growth before the Excise Department undertook to supply them, and it is possible that the old sources of supply of local growth are not yet quite closed, though the evidence shows the contrary. Madras. 382. In the Madras Presidency the only form of the drug which need be consi- dered for the present purpose is ganja. Charas is only very exceptionally used, and there is no record of the amount imported. Bhang is not a distinct article from ganja. The liquid
CH. VIII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 145 preparations, as well as the sweetmeats and electuaries, are made from ganja. Preparations of the latter class occupy a much more prominent place in the evidence of witnesses than they do in other parts of India, and this would sug- gest that they are in more common use. The statistics of retail sale do not show the full consumption of ganja. 383. The statistics furnished by the Madras Government give 67,000 srs as the retail sale of ganja for 1892-93. It has been ascertained that these are srs of 80 tolas, and the registered consumption is therefore 1,675 Indian maunds. In a previous chapter it was estimated that the share of the Madras produce which stayed at home was 3,500 maunds. A considerable reduction has to be made from this on account of waste to arrive at the amount which actually goes into consumption. The general tenor of the Madras evidence must also be noted. The same general unfamiliarity on the part of the witnesses with the facts relating to con- sumption which has been found more or less all over India exists in Madras also, and perhaps to a greater degree. The returns of retail sales obtained from the shops cannot represent more than a portion of the consumption of the Presidency, for there is ample evidence to show that the drug is freely handed about, and it has been admitted in official reports that the consumption is much larger than was supposed. Use of ganja in different parts of the Presidency. 384. The figures of retail sale place the districts in the following order as regards their rate of consumption: Madras, Kistna, Trichinopoly, Bellary, North Arcot, Tanjore, Mala- bar, Vizagapatam, Godavari, South Arcot, Madura, Salem, Cuddapah, South Canara, Coimbatore, Nellore, Tinnevelly, Chingleput, Ganjam, Anantapur, and Kurnool (Nilgiris no figures furnished). The evidence leaves the impression that the use is most common in the Northern Circars and gradually diminishes to the south until the Nilgiris are reached, where, according to some witnesses, the percentage of consumers on the population is high. The statistics and the evidence, therefore, do not agree; for, according to the former, Ganjam takes a very low place, while some southern districts are high on the list. It appears, however, from the evidence that the people of the northern hill tracts prefer opium, and consume little of the hemp drugs. The latter are used principally in Vizianagram and the seaport towns. The non-consuming population of the hill tracts would materially affect the rate of consumption as deduced from the figures. Kistna may owe its high position to other than strictly retail sales, as it is a district of production, and the same may be the case with North Arcot. Trichinopoly and Bellary have troops and probably heavy consumption in the cities to account for their retail sales being high. The position of Malabar is justified by the evidence as to the use in that part of the Presidency. The consumption of the City of Madras is probably indicated with fair accuracy by the figure of retail sale. It is lower than that of Bombay, which again is lower than that of Calcutta, the figures being146 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VIII. would then come to about 72,000, or .2 per cent. of the population. At- tention has already been drawn to the apparent prevalence of the use of sweetmeats and other refined preparations concocted with ganja. The occa- sional use of these forms of the drug must extend to a very large share of the population over and above the number of regular consumers. There are also a certain number of drinkers of the liquid preparations. Increase and decrease of use of ganja. 386. The preponderance of evidence is decidedly in favour of the view that the use of the hemp drugs is increasing. The causes assigned for increase are generally the same as those mentioned in other provinces, the high price of liquor taking a prominent place among them. The Collectors, however, are generally of opinion that the use is stationary or decreasing. When decrease is alleged, it is in most cases attributed to the restrictions brought about by the excise arrangements, the raising of the price of the drug, and the limitation of the number of places where it can be bought. The statements of witnesses Nos. 131 and 155 may be consulted on this point. It has also been pointed out that stray cultivation is being discouraged, though it has not been formally pro- hibited. Thus there are causes operating to modify the extent of use in both directions, and the Commission do not think that the evidence enables them to say which are the more potent, or to judge in any way what the actual con- sumption is. Madras States. 387. The Travancore import has been estimated at 100 maunds, which would be sufficient for 4,000 consumers. The use appears to be more prevalent in the hilly and malarious tracts. Some alleged increase is attributed to the relaxation of religious sentiment in regard to the use of intoxicants and communication with foreigners. The infor- mation regarding the other States furnishes no facts of special interest. Bombay. 388. Ganja is used in all parts of the Bombay Presidency, a large share of the consumption of it being in the form of sweetmeats and drink. Bhang is used in the Bombay City and the Northern Division. Charas is smoked in the City of Bombay only, and that in very small quantity. Use in different parts of the Presidency of ganja. 389. The figures of retail sale of ganja are wanting in some districts and irregular in others, so that it may be doubted if they can lay claim to accuracy even in the districts where they appear to be complete. Such as they are, they make the various districts take approximately the following order as regards their con- sumption of ganja: Dharwar, Bombay, Kanara, Bijapur, Nasik, Satara, Poona, Ahmedabad, Surat, Ahmednagar, Belgaum, Broach, Sholapur, Khandesh, Panch Mahals, Kaira, and Ratnagiri. Total consumption of ganja. 390. There are no figures for Thana and Kolaba. The total of the district figures of retail sale taken out as far as practicable by five years' averages, with an allow- ance made for Thana and Kolaba, comes to about 3,800 maunds. The total consumption has been estimated in a previous chapter at maunds 3,000, and it was thought that this was a liberal calculation. Before expressing any opinion from these figures as to the incidence of consumption on the population, it will be as well to examine the evidence as to individual consumption.

CH. VIII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 147 Individual allowance of ganja. 391. Mr. Almon, Assistant Collector of Abkari in Bombay, maintains that the moderate consumer of ganja spends two annas a day on his indulgence, and consumes one tola of the drug. This represents an annual consumption of over four srs and an expenditure of Rs. 45, and only admits of ten consumers being supplied by each maund of the drug. The average sale of 258 maunds, with allowance for waste, only suffices therefore for 2,000 or 2,500 consumers. Some wit- nesses, but they are few, state that the daily allowance of a moderate consumer is above one tola. The majority of witnesses put it at less. The lowest limit is reached by the Collector of Ratnagiri, who gives one-sixteenth of a tola as the average daily allowance, and reports 8,000 consumers in the district, of which the average retailsales amount to 74 maunds148 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VIII. Collector of Dharwar, has endeavoured to ascertain the causes of this in- crease, and whether it is connected with the decline in the consumption of liquor and toddy. He reports that he can trace no connection between the two phenomena; that there has been a large increase in the consump- tion of ganja, which is to be attributed to the introduction of the railway bring- ing with it scores of ganja smokers and eaters; that there is no reason to suppose that the people of the district have generally taken to the use of the drug, though a number of individuals may have contracted the habit from foreigners; and that there is no export of the drug. He attaches a statement showing that the retail sales of 1892-93 amounted to 1,345 maunds, an increase of more than 200 maunds over the figures of 1891-92. It is impossible to suppose that this huge amount can have been consumed in the district. It is larger than the whole consumption of the Central Provinces with its Feudatory States and zamindaris. The only reasonable explanation is that the greater part of it leaves the district, and enters the surrounding foreign territory, Hyderabad, Mysore, and Goa. The Kanara district also may possibly get its supply from the Dharwar shops. The Dharwari ganja is not unknown, as the Commission found, in Mysore. This exaggeration in the Dharwar figures furnishes one more reason for distrusting those of other districts as an index of the local consumption. Increase and decrease of con- sumption. 394. On the point of general increase or decrease in the use of ganja, the re- sponsible official witnesses, excepting the Collector of Bijapur, take the view that there is no perceptible change. On the other hand, there are witnesses of other classes who observe increase, and attribute it to the same economic and social causes as have been noticed in other provinces. But it may be noted that the high price of liquor does not take a prominent place among them, and many statements will be found to the effect that the hemp drugs are giving way to liquor. It cannot be said that there is a preponderance of the evidence either way or that there is any satisfactory basis for forming an opinion. The only causes of increase which can be assumed to have operated in the direction of increase are the increase of population and de- velopment of railways. The social causes would seem to tell both ways, education, however, being rather favourable to decrease of the habit than the reverse. The fact that the lower orders are addicted to liquor in the Bombay Presidency, and that their earnings are comparatively high and enable them to indulge this pre- dilection, is a factor operating against increase of the hemp habit. Regarding bhang and charas, the tendency of the evidence is to show that the former is giving way to liquor; the use of the latter, practically confined to the City of Bombay and insignificant in extent, shows no sign of increase. Bombay States. 395. The extent of use described in the Presidency may be accepted as applicable to the Native States under the supervision of the Bombay Government. There are no materials to enable a more exact estimate to be formed. In the Deccan and Southern Maratha Country ganja must be the favourite form of the drug, and in the Gujarat States, Kathiawar, and Cutch it is to a great extent superseded by bhang. Aden. 396. The statistics show that about 40 maunds of ganja and 4 of bhang are consumed in Aden, of which the population is 42,734. This gives the high rate of ganja consumption of one maund to 1,000 of the population. The maximum price at which the contractor
CH. VIII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 149 is allowed to sell is one anna a tola, and there is no minimum. The aver- age price is probably much the same as that of the shops in the Presidency pro- per. If the Bombay rate of 30 consumers to the maund be taken, the consumers are about 3 per cent. of the population, or one man out of every 8 or 10. Con- sidering the character of the population, composed to a great extent of Indian sepoys and the followers of native regiments, the high figure is not surpris- ing. There is reason to think that service abroad induces a more liberal con- sumption of the hemp drugs among native regiments and their followers. Sind and Khairpur. Total consumption estimated of bhang. 397. The average production of bhang in Sind and Khairpur is about 4,000 maunds. The statistics give the average retail sale of the British districts as 4,539 maunds, and this does not include the consumption of Karachi, for which district no figures of retail sale are given. The population and circumstances of Karachi compared with both those of Hyderabad justify the assumption that at least 500 maunds are consumed in the former. The figure of total consumption of the province must be raised by this amount, and by 1,000 according to the statistics for the State of Khairpur. But looking to the population of Khairpur, this consumption appears excessive, and the retail sale probably includes locally produced drug sold for consumption in other districts of Sind. So also it is probable that the retail sale of the Shikarpur district, where there is a considerable area of cultivation, includes the drug which has been exported. This district has not as high a figure of population as Hyderabad, and yet is credited with double the consumption. Hyderabad has but a trifling area of cultivation, and its figures of retail sale are probably a fairly accurate index of the consumption. They give one maund to 820 of the population, or say 800, allowing a few maunds for defective registration. This rate applied to the whole population of Sind with Khairpur, about 3,000,000, gives a total consumption of 3,750 maunds, which approximates to the estimate of production based on the area of cultivation. The statistics on a six years' average show that about 650 maunds of bhang are imported, mostly into the Shikarpur district. The estimated consumption, 3,750 maunds, therefore, only falls short of the total supply, 4,650 maunds, by 900 maunds, which is not an extravagant allowance for waste. Individual allowance. Number of regular consumers of bhang. 398. The average price of bhang is about Re. 1 a sr, and the average daily allowance 1 tola or about 4 srs per annum. A maund therefore supplies about 20 regular moderate consum- ers. But the majority of the consumers take the drug only occasionally. The use in Sind150 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VIII. to be about 1/4 tola, or 1/2 sr per annum. There would then be about 2,000 charas smokers in the province, and these are all regular consumers. The cost at the above rate is Rs. 121/2 per annum, which is reasonable. The district of Shikarpur would seem to contain nearly half of the charas smokers. Number of consumers of ganja. 400. The consumption of ganja is about the same as that of charas. The former is, however, the cheaper drug; the individual consumption is probably therefore larger, and the smokers less numerous. The use is most prevalent in Karachi and Hyderabad, and may be said not to exist in Shikarpur and the Upper Sind Frontier. Thar and Parkar consumes more ganja than charas, hardly any of the latter. Increase of consumption. 401. The statistics do not furnish any reliable index of the growth or decline the use of either of the drugs. The evidence indicates increase, except in the case of ganja, but not very decidedly. The Commissioner (Mr. James) bears testimony by personal observation to the increase of the different classes of ascetics who principally are addicted to the drugs. Their number by the census of 1891 was 18,594. He isalso of opinion that the use has spread among the labouring classes, whose wages have greatly risen in recent years. The addition to the population during the last 20 years, which amounts to over 30 per cent., must in the natural course of things have caused an increase of the total consumption. Berar. 402. The memorandum of the Hyderabad Assigned Districts throws doubt on the figures of retail sale of ganja contained in column 44 of the statistical table. They show an average comsumption in the last five years of some 800 maunds. They are fairly regular, and, but for the discredit thrown on them by the memorandum, seem fit to be accepted as an index of consumption. It is true that the local production and import together amount to 1,300 maunds. But the drug in this form contains a great deal of useless material, and it is probable that when sold retail 1,300 maunds get reduced to 800. This is not so large a proportion of waste as was found in the Central Provinces. The imported drug seems to come from Khandwa, and it is not likely that the local ganja is a more finished product than that imported. If the consumption of Berar is to be compared with that of the neighbouring Central Provinces, where the figures of retail sale represented the consumption of the cleaned drug, it certainly cannot be taken to be more than 800 maunds; and probably this is a high figure. In Berar the price of the drug is one-fourth of what it is in the Central Provinces. It is probable, therefore, that the individual allowance is very much higher. The evidence puts it at 1/2 tola a day, or approximately 2 srs per annum, which would cost Rs. 5. There would thus be 20 consumers to the maund and 16,000 in the province, giving a percentage of .55 on the total population. The result is not far different from that arrived at in the Central Provinces. As regards the result and individual cost, it appears to be reasonable. The evidence regarding increase and decrease of use is of the usual contradictory character. The statistics throw no light on the point, for they are not correct as regards the retail sales, and, as regards the imports, are not in a suitable form for the purpose. The preponderance of evidence is in favour of increase, but the direct observation of a witness like (31), who says that the younger men rarely smoke, must go for something. If the evidence of the majority be accepted, it is nevertheless certain that the increase is not very marked.
CH. VIII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 151 Ajmere- Merwara. 403. The reports and evidence from Ajmere-Merwara furnish no statistics to enable an estimate to be made of the extent of use of the hemp drugs. There was an increase of revenue in 1890-91 which was explained in the annual excise report to be due to com- petition at the auction of monopoly. There is no evidence of any increase or de- crease of use. Coorg. 404. In Coorg the import of ganja amounts to 21 maunds and registered con- sumption to 14. The population is 173,055. The retail price is 14 annas to 1 rupee for a sr of 24 tolas, or approximately 2/3 anna per tola. Taking the minimum individual allowance at 1/4 tola or 1/6 anna per diem, the annual individual consumption comes to 90 tolas, and the cost to something less than Rs. 5. This is a reasonable allowance. The consumers would number about 1,000, or between .5 and .6 per cent. of the popu- lation. It is probable that the consumption tends to increase with the influx of coolies into coffee and cardamom estates. Baluchistan. 405. There is no information of the quantity of hemp drugs consumed in any part of Baluchistan. Bhang and ganja appear to come from India, and charas and chur ganja from Afghan- istan as well as India. The Deputy Commissioner of Thal Chotiali reports that the Baluchis and Pathans of that district are not addicted to the drugs; but there is information from other quarters that the Baluchis and Pathans generally do smoke. The drinking of bhang would appear to be confined to Pathans and Indians. It is said that the consumption of the drugs is decreasing as the Indian population, which was larger when military operations were going on, is being reduced. The average prices seem to be Re. 1 for bhang, Rs. 20 for charas, and Rs. 78 for ganja per sr. Burma. 406. It has been shown that the hemp drugs, or ganja at least, are smuggled into Burma in considerable quantity. But it is impossible to say to what extent the Indians manage to supply their wants, or with any accuracy the price they have to pay for the drug. There does not seem to be any use by the Burmans or people other than the natives of India. The inquiries made by the Commission tend to show that the quantity introduced into the country is increasing. Hyderabad, Mysore, Rajputana, Central India, and Baroda. 407. It is hardly worth while to examine in detail the statistics and evidence re- lating to the extent to which the hemp drugs are used in the great Native States and Agencies. These ter- ritories are surrounded and intermingled with British territories, regarding which the question has been fully discussed, with the result that the statistics were found in most cases to be far from an accurate index of con- sumption, and the evidence did not justify very precise conclusions. More definite results, or equally definite, will certainly not be obtained from the information sup- plied by Native States. The extent of use in each part of these territories may be taken to resemble that in the neighbouring British provinces. The use of ganja will be found to prevail over the States of the Central India Agency as it does in the North-Western Provinces, Bengal, and the Central Provinces. The use of bhang will be more common than that of the other drugs in Marwar and the north-western parts of Rajputana, and it will extend southwards towards the Bombay Presidency, and eastwards towards the States of Central India,
152 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VIII. gradually meeting with more competition from ganja. A moderate use of charas will be found all over the States which are within easy reach of the Punjab and the North-Western Provinces. The extent of use of ganja in Hyderabad will be fairly well indicated by the estimates of Berar, the Bombay Presidency, and Madras as regards the parts of the State contiguous to those provinces, and a similar process of examination will give the consumption of Mysore. In these two States bhang as a separate form of the raw drug has practically disappeared, but charas finds a few consumers in Hyderabad. Baroda consumption is the same as that of the northern part of Bombay Presidency. Kashmir and Nepal. 408. In Kashmir and Nepal the wild plant furnishes the whole, or a very large share, of the consumptionCH. VIII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 153 Little evidence of excessive use. 411. As regards the character of the habit, the smokers are for the most part regular smokers, and the drinkers indulge occasionally, and principally in the hot weather. In these respects the habit resembles that of the civil population. It is natural that excess should be comparatively uncommon in bodies of men living under strict discipline. It has been found that even in the police, where the men have more personal liberty, the use of hemp rarely obtrudes itself. Use of the different drugs. 412. The habit of drinking bhang is more prevalent in the corps serving in the north-western part of India, but it cannot be said that smoking is more common in one part than another. Charas is preferred in the comparatively small tract where it is cheap and easily procurable, and ganja is used elsewhere. Smoking is regarded as a protection against cold, and bhang drinking as a relief under the distress of very hot weather. The habit, therefore, varies according as regiments experience different conditions of climate, and it would seem that on service the number of smokers increases. The preparation of the drink, how- ever, takes time, and requires certain ingredients which on service may not be obtainable. It is doubtful, therefore, if bhang drinking increases on service as smoking does, but the practice of chewing or eating the drug in a simpler form may very well take its place. Use among principal castes of sepoys. 413. The Sikhs drink bhang and do not smoke; but it is reported of more than one Sikh regiment that the men do not use any of the drugs. In one regiment they have given up bhang for the good rum which the canteen supplies. The Gur- khas also prefer liquor, and rarely use the hemp drugs. The habit would seem to be more prevalent in the Gurkha regiments serving in Assam than elsewhere, but uncommon even there. The Rajputs and Purbhias seem to be more given to the drugs than other castes. There is some strictness among the Muhammadans in some of the regiments of the north of India in regard to both smoking and drinking of hemp; but in Madras they appear to have the full proportion of smokers among them. Evidence indicates decrease of use in the army. 414. The very great majority of the replies state that the use of the drugs is decreasing, and among the 38 which take the opposite view, 13 do not refer to the troops, but to the civil population. Some replies also are not very definite. There are hardly more than 20 out of the 274 which can be said to be evidence on the side of increase. The actual facts on which increase is alleged are not often stated, but the commandant of a Bengal Cavalry regiment finds that 25 years ago not a man in the regiment used the drugs, while now some do, espe- cially among the later enlisted men. The causes of increase, when they are stated, which is very rarely, are the cheapness of the drugs as compared with liquor, the speedy action and convenient form of charas, and the religious objec- tion to the use of liquor. On the other hand, there is a strong body of evid- ence on the side of decrease. The cause which appears most prominently in the replies is the greater demand which service makes in these days on the time and intelligence of the sepoy. He cannot spare the time to indulge in the drugs, which involves the laborious preparation of bhang as drink, and the period of listlessness and incapacity which follows an ill-regulated dose either 39
154 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VIII. as drink or smoke. And he is said to be conscious that the habit renders a man less fit for the things he has to do and learn. In many regiments the prohibi- tion is credited with having had a decided effect in reducing the practice. In some it is said that the older men, who have the habit, are retiring, and making room for young men, who, entering the more intellectual school of soldiering, do not readily acquire it. This is in direct contrast with the evidence from a Ben- gal Cavalry regiment quoted above, and it is for this reason the quotation was made. Both opinions are apparently based on observation, and that in favour of decrease has a great number of adherents, while the officer who holds the other stands almost alone. The point is of general interest as touching on the quality of the modern recruit apart from the hemp question. The rise in the price of drugs is alleged in some quarters as a cause of decrease, and in others the cheap- ness of liquor. It is probable that liquor is competing with drugs in the army as it is doing among the better classes of the civil population. Varieties of ganja. 415.

When it ceases to part with any colour to the water, it is ready to be smoked. The chillum is a bowl with a short neck issuing straight from the bottom of it, all made of clay; the same that is commonly used for smoking tobacco. It is laid with a foundation of a small quantity of tobacco. On this is placed the washed ganja which has been chopped up and another thin layer of tobacco. A live coal is placed on the charged pipe, a damp cloth is generally wrapped round the neck of it and folded into the palm of the left hand, while the pipe is grasped by the neck between the thumb and first finger. The right hand is pressed, fingers upwards, against the cloth and neck of the pipe, and the draught is made through the space between the thumb and first finger of this hand. A few short breaths are blown and drawn to light up the pipe, and when this is accomplished one long deep draught is taken with the lungs. The pipe is then handed on to a companion, and so goes the round of the circle. Manner of smoking charas. 417. In Bengal charas is only used by people in good circumstances. It is in the Punjab and North-Western Provinces that most is to be learnt about the ordinary method of consuming it. It varies in quality and price, and is often very much adulterated. It is almost wholly used for smoking. A quantity, not larger than is usually put into the ganja pipe, is buried or kneaded up in two or three times the quantity of tobacco in the form (gurakhu) in which it is prepared for smoking with the huka. The huka is then smoked in the ordinary way, the draught being taken into the lungs. Dry tobacco may be used instead of the prepared tobacco, and the chillum instead of the huka. Other ways of smoking. 418. Ganja also is sometimes smoked in the huka, and other implements and means of smoking are mentioned. Thus in Bombay and the Central Provinces epicures occa- sionally use a pipe made of sugarcane in preference to the chillum. There are also certain rude expedients in vogue amongst jungle people for the smoking of tobacco, which are no doubt resorted to in connection with the hemp drug, and some of which appear in the evidence. The pipe bowl may be constructed in the ground, and a reed used to communicate with the mouth. A pipe or cigarette may be made with leaves. The leaf cigarette containing a mixture of tobacco and hemp leaves is spoken of in the Madras Presidency. A green branch of the Euphorbia neriifolia can be readily fashioned into a pipe, and is commonly used on emergency in the Satpura Hills. And in connection with the smoking of charas, there appears to be a custom at religious gatherings in Upper India for religious mendicants to sling a huge chillum containing a sr or more of the drug to a tree so that all comers may partake of it. Bhang, i.e., hemp leaves, or the very inferior kinds of ganja or ganja refuse, is only smoked under the compulsion of poverty or want of the better article. Mixture of spices in smoking. 419. The above are the simplest forms in which the drugs are smoked. But the well-to-do are fond of flavouring the pipe with spices. The mixture with tobacco has the effect of making the pipe burn properly and go further, and of diluting the smoke which is inhaled; but other explanations are given of the reason for using tobacco with the drugs. Spices give fragrance and flavour to the pipe, and possibly, some of them, pungency. Those commonly used are musk, mace, saffron,
156 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VIII. cloves, cardamom, keori (the male flower of Pandamus odoratissimus), rose, leaves, attar, nutmeg, ginger, betel-nut, and betel-leaves. Mixture of potent drugs in smoking. 420. Powerful and noxious drugs are occasionally introduced into the pipe; but this practice is confined to excessive consumers, and among them to a mere proportion only, on whom hemp alone has ceased to produce the desired effect of exhilaration or stupefaction. The seeds of dhatura are by far the commonest ingredient of this class. The next place should probably be taken by opium, and then follow arsenic and nux vomica, aconite, and the root of kanher (Nerium odorum or Thevetia neriifolia, the latter of which is known among the natives as yellow kanher), and after these may be mentioned certain substances to which the consumers attribute poisonous or intoxicating properties, or at least the virtue of enhancing the potency of the hemp. Such are hemp seeds, the root of the cold-weather jawari (sorghum of the kind called ringni in the Central Provinces and shalu in Bombay), the root of rice, the juice of the madar(Callotropis gigantea), and the skins and poison of snakes; and, lastly, cantha- rides is sometimes mixed for a special purpose. It is said that the jawari root is sometimes soaked in liquor to increase its potency. In describing these ad- mixtures, distinction has not been made between charas and ganja smoking because the use of the ingredients is a matter of individual caprice, and they do not form part of any recognized preparation of the hemp drugs. Simple preparation for drinking. 421. As with smoking, so in the case of drinking, there is a common and simple form, and also various compounds more or less elaborate. The simple form is merely to pound the drug very fine with a little black pepper, add water according to the strength of the drink desired, and filter the decoction through a cloth. This beverage is sometimes made with the bhang composed almost entirely of the leaves of the plant, and sometimes, most commonly outside Bengal, the North-Western Provinces, and the Punjab, of the flower heads or mixture of flower and leaves that has come away in the course of the manufacture of ganja. It goes by different names in various parts of India. In Bengal it is commonly called bhang or siddhi; in the North-Western Provinces bhang, siddhi, or thandai;in the Punjab, Bombay, and Central Provinces bhang or ghota; and in Sind ghota and panga according to its strength. In Madras the simplest form of preparation seems to be very little used, but when it is, it is probably called bhang or subzi. The Madras preparation called ramras or ramrasamseems to correspond to the dudhia of Upper India. The common names may be taken to include all forms of beverage made from the hemp drugs, except those which have special names of their own. Spiced preparations for drinking. 422. There is next a class of beverages in which the hemp drug and pepper are supplemented by harmless perfumes and spices, the whole enriched, it may be, with sugar and milk or curds. Every bhang drinker who can afford it adds some or other of these ingredients. The spices most commonly used are anise, fennel, coriander, dill, ajwan (Ptychotis), cucumber and musk-melon seeds, almonds, rose leaves, cloves, saffron, and cardamom. But many others of the same class of innocent ingredients are mentioned, viz., hemp and poppy seeds, mace, mint cummin, endive, parsley, musk, betel-leaves, keori, attar, cinnamon, lotus seeds the seed of hollyhock, the kernels of pistachio and charoli (Buchanania

The juices of fruits and trees are also employed in the concoction, such as that of the pome- granate, grape, mango, bael, cocoanuts, and date (not toddy). Mixture of potent drugs for drinking. 423. The above ingredients are used by all moderate consumers according to their taste and means. There are others which by their potency, their uncommonness, or their quaint- ness are designed to meet the craving of consumers whom the compounds in ordinary use fail to satisfy. Here again dhatura takes the first place, and evidence is not wanting that the seeds of this plant are sometimes kept in stock by the grocers who supply the other ingredients, if not by the sellers of the drugs. Besides dhatura, opium, arsenic, strychnine, aconite, the oleander root, and seed of black henbane are mentioned as being introduced into hemp drinks. A mixture of two or three of these with the hemp drugs in one or two forms, and perhaps one or two other fanciful ingredients, goes by the cant name of panchratna (the five jewels), panchrangi, or panjtul. The name is apparently applied to this sort of compound, and sometimes even to more innocent ones, whether it is to be used for eating, drinking, or smoking. The poison of copper is sometimes utilized by making the decoction in a copper vessel, or putting copper coins into it while it is being prepared. Curious ingredients for drinking. 424. There is still another class of ingredients, which are used because they are believed to have a certain efficiency of their own, or to be instrumental in enhancing the power of the hemp drug. These are the roots of grass, of rice, and of jawar, the manna and rotten knots of bamboo, soot, cobwebs, decayed string, the juice of the ak (swallow wort), and the root of mothk. These are, of course, to be regarded as curiosities of the subject, though the mention of the jawari root is rather frequent. As in the case of smoking, cantharides is very rarely men- tioned as an ingredient. Use of hemp drugs with alcohol. 425. The hemp drugs are sometimes used to doctor alcoholic drinks. In the Punjab the name lutki is given to a concoction of this kind. In Baluchistan there is also said to be a drink called mudra, which is compounded of dhatura, bhang, alcohol, and opium. The drink is also known in the Punjab. In other quarters the hemp drugs are said to be smoked after drinking liquor to add to the intoxication. The evidence of the association of the hemp drugs with alcohol in these ways is fortunately scanty. The practice is probably rare, for it implies a recklessness in intemperance which is foreign to the Indian character. Boja. 426. There is a liquid preparation of ganja in use in the Sholapur district of the Bombay Presidency which seems to be little known elsewhere. It is called boja, and its preparation is described by Bombay witnesses 25 and 47. The consump- tion is considerable, amounting in the year 1891-92 to 138,100 srs. It appears to consist principally of a gruel made from jawari, and to contain a comparatively small proportion of hemp and a little nux vomica. After brewing, it has to be kept a day, when water is added, and it is drunk. Hemp decoctions sometimes kept ready made. 427. Bhang drink is kept for sale in Karachi. Witness 5 from Sind says tha the refreshment is prepared and kept in readi- ness to be supplied gratuitously for the use of visitors 40
158 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. VIII. and passers-by in almost all the places of worship. The same practice is indi- cated in the evidence of the manager of the dharamsala near Athari in the Punjab. Mr. Drummond describes a social custom of the same kind as prevail- ing among the Hindu Jats in the south-eastern districts of the Punjab. Simple form of eating hemp. 428. Ganja and bhang are eaten as well as drunk. Charas, if medicinal uses be excepted, is very rarely consumed in any other way but in the form of smoke. The simplest form of eating ganja and bhang is to pound them up with such spices as were mentioned in the preparation of bhang, and to swallow the paste in the form of a bolus. The mass is sometimes compounded with molasses or gur.The leaves of the green plants are even chewed on occasion. It docs not, however, appear to be a regular practice with any people in any part of India to consume the drugs in this manner. The habitual bhang drinker will do it when he has difficulty in preparing his drink. It is done on a journey. It would seem to be more common to eat the paste in the cold weather than the hot. A mass will sometimes be prepared and kept for use day by day. This paste is known in the Punjab, Berar, and Bombay as fakki or fanki, and it seems to be used by the poor not uncommonly. Hemp sweetmeats. 429. There is, however, a very considerable consumption of sweetmeats made with ganja or bhang, or even sometimes charas. They are all prepared in very much the same way, their various names and properties depending on the proportion of the hemp drugs and other ingredients that they contain. Their basis is sugar and milk, and the essence of the hemp drug is extracted by the aid of heat, and compounded with them with other drugs and spices or perfumes. The most common of them is majum, and the preparation is known by that name from one end of India to the other. It is largely used at certain Hindu feasts. It is evidently credited with aphrodisiacal qualities. Many people consume it habit- ually, either throughout the year or in the cold season, abandoning it in the hot in favour of the liquid preparations. The names of other similar preparations are yakuti (in general use from the Deccan northwards), purnathi (Madras), gul- khand (Bombay), shrikhand (Bombay), halwa (in general use), and many others. These preparations are all considered to be aphrodisiacal, some to such a degree that they should perhaps be regarded as medicinal forms rather than articles of ordinary consumption. It is stated that in preparing these mixtures copper vessels are sometimes used or copper coins immersed in the process, and doubt- less the toxic and tonic drugs mentioned in connection with the preparation of drinks sometimes enter into them. Various ways of using hemp for consumption. 430. Hemp is sometimes compounded into cakes made of gram flour. It is used as a seasoning in the cooking of various dishes, those composed of meat as well as others. More than one witness in more than one province mentions this use at parties to make fun of the guests. A witness from the Punjab describes how powdered bhang is sometimes wrapped in dhatura leaves, the whole enclosed in a covering of clay and baked. It is not clear whether the cooked substance is eaten or drunk. It might be either. Witnesses, speaking of the northern part of the Bombay Presidency, state that gram and dates are some- times charged with hemp. And in Calcutta the drug is occasionally used to flavour ice-cream.
CHAPTER IX. SOCIAL AND RELIGIOUS CUSTOMS. Scope of this Chapter. 431. In the instructions issued to the Commission by the Government of India, reference is made to the use of hemp drugs among fakirs and ascetics who are held in veneration by large classes of the people, and to the custom, which is believed to obtain to a large extent in Bengal, of offering an infusion of bhang to every guest and member of the family on the last day of the Durga Puja. The Commission were instructed to ascertain to what extent these and similar customs prevail in Bengal and other parts of India, and how far the use of hemp drugs forms a part of social, or possibly religious, ceremonial or observance. Questions 32 and 33 of the Commission's questions were intended to elicit information on these points. Bengal. 432. In Bengal there is a considerable body of evidence dealing with these customs, and more particularly with the custom of offering an infusion of bhang on the last day of the Durga Puja. Some few witnesses, it is true, state either that no social or religi- ous custom with which hemp drugs are connected exists, or that they are unaware of any such custom; but the great majority of the witnesses either give an account of them more or less full, or allude to them briefly as matters of common notoriety. Durga Puja. 433. The custom of offering an infusion of the leaves of the hemp plant to every guest and member of the family on the Bijoya Dasami, or last day of the Durga Puja, is common in Bengal, and may almost be said to be universal. It is alluded to by many of the witnesses who refer to its use on this occasion as well as on other days of the Durga Puja festival. But, while there can be no doubt as to the existence of the custom, there is considerable divergence of opinion as to the true nature of it. The custom itself is a simple one. On the last day of this great festival the male members of the family go forth to consign the image to the waters, and on their return the whole family with their guests exchange greetings and embrace one another. During this rejoicing a cup containing an infu- sion of the leaves of the hemp plant is handed round, and all are expected to partake thereof, or at least to place it to the lips in token of acceptance. Sweetmeats containing hemp are also distributed. Opinion is almost equally divided as to whether the custom is a mere social observance, or whether it is an essential part of the religious ceremonial of the festival. There is difference of opinion among the witnesses as to whether there is any injunction in the Shastras rendering obligatory the consumption of hemp; but Tantric religious works sanction the use, and the custom, whatever be its origin, may now be said from immemorial usage to be regarded by many people as part of their religious observances. From the evidence of the witnesses it would appear that there is no specific direction in the Shastras of the manner in which the drug should be used, but from the references quoted it would appear that the use alluded to is that of bhang in the form of an infusion. Witnesses who can speak with authority on the subject, such as Mahamahopadhya Mahesa Chandra Nyayaratna, C.I.E., Principal of the Government Sanskrit College, Calcutta, testify to religious sanction for the use of bhang or siddhi, while many witnesses of high social position, well
160 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. IX. acquainted with the habits of the people, as, for example, Maharaja Sir Jotindra Mohan Tagore, K.C.S.I., Maharaja Durga Charan Law, Raja Piari Mohan Mukharji, C.S.I., Rai Rajkumar Sarvadhikari Bahadur, Rai Bahadur Kanai Lall Dey, C.I.E., and others, speak to the prevalence of the custom, its intimate asso- ciation with the religious devotions of the people, and the innocent harmlessness of the practice. Other occasions on which bhang is used. 434. The custom described above, and which refers solely to bhang as distin- guished from other preparations of the hemp plant, is the most important occasion on which bhang is used as a part of social or religious ceremonies; but there is evidence to show that the drug in this form is used at other festivals. For example, at the Holi festival, which is observed more generally in Behar than in other parts of the Lower Provinces, bhang is commonly consumed; and, accord- ing to many witnesses, at such festivals as the Diwali, Chait Sankranti, Pous Sankranti, Sripanchami, Sivachaturdasi, Ramnavami, and indeed on occasions of weddings and many other family festivities. But, so far as the evidence shows, the use on those occasions is a matter of social custom observed more generally in some parts of the province than in others, and, although no doubt there may be some who consider it essential to their devotions, par- taking but little of the nature of general religious observance. In Orissa bhang is largely used by the attendants and worshippers at the temple of Jagannath at Puri; and there appears also to exist a custom, somewhat similar to that of the Durga Puja in Bengal, of offering siddhi or bhang in the form of sweetmeats to the god Ganesh, which are then eaten by the worshippers and their friends and relatives. This festival, called the Ganesh Chaturthi, occurs in the month of Bhadro (August-September). Connection of ganja with the worship of Siva. 435. It is chiefly in connection with the worship of Siva, the Mahadeo or great god of the Hindu trinity, that the hemp plant, and more especially perhaps ganja, is associated. The hemp plant is popularly believed to have been a great favourite of Siva, and there is a great deal of evidence before the Commission to show that the drug in some form or other is now extensively used in the exercise of the religious practices connected with this form of worship. Reference to the almost universal use of hemp drugs by fakirs, jogis, sanyasis, and ascetics of all classes, and more particularly of those devoted to the worship of Siva, will be found in the paragraphs of this report dealing with the classes of the people who consume the drugs. These religious ascetics, who are regarded with great veneration by the people at large, believe that the hemp plant is a special attribute of the god Siva, and this belief is largely shared by the people. Hence the origin of many fond epithets ascribing to ganja the significance of a divine pro- perty, and the common practice of invoking the deity in terms of adoration before placing the chillum or pipe of ganja to the lips. There is evidence to show that on almost all occasions of the worship of this god, the hemp drugs in some form or other are used by certain classes of the people. It is established by the evidence of Mahamahopadhya Mahesa Chandra Nyayaratna and of other witnesses that siddhi is offered to the image of Siva at Benares, Baidynath, Tarakeswar, and elsewhere. At the Shivratri festival, and on almost all occasions on which this worship is practised, there is abundant evidence before the Commission which shows not only that ganja is offered to the god and consumed
CH. IX.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 161 by these classes of the worshippers, but that these customs are so intimately con- nected with their worship that they may be considered to form in some sense an integral part of it. Trinath. 436. The special form of worship by the followers of Siva, called the Trinath or Tinnath Mela, in which the use of ganja is con- sidered to be essential, is mentioned by many wit- nesses, and deserves more than a passing notice. A full account of this religious practice given by Babu Abhilas Chandra Mukharji will be found in Vol. III Appendices of this Report. The origin of the rite, which it is said sprang up first in Eastern Bengal, appears to be of recent date, about the year 1867. It appears to be observed at all times and at all seasons by Hindus and Muhammadans alike, the latter calling it Tinlakh Pir. When an object of special desire is fulfilled, or when a person recovers from illness, or a son is born, or a marriage or other ceremony is performed, the god Trinath, representing in one the Hindu trinity, is worshipped. Originally one pice worth of ganja, one pice worth of oil, and one pice worth of betel-nut was offered to the god. But now ganja162 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. IX. to say that the custom is now a general one, and that where the Holi festival is observed, there the practice of consuming bhang during its observance is common. On other occasions, such as the Diwali festival, marriages, and family festivities, there is evidence to show that among certain classes the consumption of bhang is common. Allusion is also frequently made to the habit of using bhang, to which, for example, the Chaubes of Mathra and Brindaban are notoriously addicted, but how far the habit is connected with the religious observances at the temples the evidence does not justify the formation of an opinion. A custom is mention- ed by a Kumaon witness, Dharma Nand Joshi, who states that a class of people called Kouls, who worship spirits, meat, fish, etc., have the bhang plant as one of the objects of their worship. Punjab. 440. In the Punjab there is evidence as to the general use of hemp by some of the followers of Siva, and especially of bhang, at the Holi, Dasehra, Diwali, and other festivals, and on the occasion of marriages and other family festivities. Among the Sikhs the use of bhang as a beverage appears to be common, and to be associated with their reli- gious practices. The witnesses who refer to this use by the Sikhs appear to regard it as an essential part of their religious rites having the authority of the Granth or Sikh scripture. Witness Sodhi Iswar Singh, Extra Assistant Com- missioner, says:CH. IX.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 163 of old Sikh times, is annually permitted to collect without interference a boat load of bhang, which is afterwards distributed throughout the year to the sadhus and beggars who are supported by the dharamsala. Central Provinces. 441. The evidence as to social or religious customs in the Central Provinces is somewhat discrepant, but on the whole points to the existence of customs akin to those existing in the North-Western Provinces. The use of bhang at the Holi and Diwali festivals and at marriages and such occasions, and of ganja or bhang in connection with the worship of Siva, is frequently mentioned by the wit- nesses. A few local customs are also mentioned by some witnesses. Re- garding a custom of the Chamar caste, the Rev. Mr. Jacob says: "At Chanda, the Chamars use ganja dust in the preparation of a beverage called gulabpani, which is drunk at a ceremony called dadhi (the first shaving of the beard), when no liquor is permitted." Among the Gonds, Cowasjee Nusser- wanjee Hattidaru describes the following custom as existing: "In the funeral ceremony amongst the Gonds of these provinces, kalli or flat ganja is placed over the chest of the dead body of the Gond, and when the funeral party returns home, a little of the ganja is burnt in the house of the dead person, the smoke of which is supposed to reach the spirit of the dead." Another Satpura witness, Hosen Khan, mentions a custom of offering "a little ganja at the Chitarai Debis, or collections of stones with rags tied to some tree above. They offer either a cock or a cocoanut or some ganja. It is a custom among travellers. These Chitarai Debis are in the open, and the travellers have a smoke at the same time." One witness states that he has heard of the hemp plant being worshipped in the Berars, but this is not corroborated by any of the witnesses from these districts. Another has heard that the Gonds in their hill homes are worshippers of the plant. Madras. 442. In the Madras Presidency, where the use of hemp drugs is less common than in most other provinces, many witnesses assert that there are no customs, social or religious, with which they are connected, and the evidence as a whole fails to establish the pre- valence of any customs so general as those connected with the Durga Puja and the worship of Siva in Bengal or the Holi festival in the North-Western Prov- inces. But there is evidence as to the existence of customs of a less general or widespread nature. In Ganjam, the witnesses speak to the, common use of bhang on the Mesha Sankranti day in honour of Siva and Anjanayya, and also in the worship of Durga. Several also allude to a custom of offering a con- fection or draught containing bhang to the image at the temples of Hanuman. At the festival of Kama, the Indian cupid, bhang is freely made and drunk according to several witnesses. The Rajputs or Bondilis are particularly referred to in connection with this custom. On occasions of holidays or gala- days, and at the Mohurram, a number of witnesses say it is usual for Muhamma- dans as well as Hindus to take bhang. It is also said that various intoxicants, including ganja, are sometimes offered to the gods in worship, and then swallowed by those offering them. Witness M. Sundaram Iyer, Deputy Tahsildar (60), says: "Some of the lower orders make use of ganja as an offering, like cocoa- nut, plantains, liquor, and such other articles, for certain deities, such as Mathura- veeran, Muniappan, etc., according to the vow taken by each person. This
164 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. IX. cannot be considered as essential, but is only a practice observed in very rare cases. Such practice is not followed by many people, and it is not injurious.' Others allude to the offering of ganja to Karuppannam, Kali, Mathuraveeran, Muniappan, Karuannaswami, and Aiyaswami, more particularly in the south of the Presidency. Mr. Azizuddin, Sahib Bahadur, Deputy Collector, says: " Neither the Musalman nor the Hindu religion requires the use of these drugs on religious occasions. On the other hand, it is prohibited. Nevertheless, in the maths of bairagis, such as at Tripati, and of Muhammadan saints, such as at Nagore, Conjeveram, Arcot, and other places, the manager of the shrine distri- butes ganja to all the fakirs who assemble during the festival. In none of these places, religiously speaking, ganja should be distributed, but, according to custom among the fakirs, its distribution is essential." The Rev. Mr. Campbell says that ganja is used in connection with the funeral ceremonies observed by certain classes, but that the use is not essential. Mr. Merriman alludes to a custom of offering and consuming bhang at the funeral of bhang consumers. Bombay. 443. An interesting note, entitled " The Religion of Hemp," by Mr. J. M. Campbell, C.I.E., will be found in Vol. Ill Appen- dices. In the Bombay Presidency the use of hemp in, connection with the worship of Siva, Mahadev or Shankar appears to be very common. It is referred to by many witnesses. The following description of this custom as prevailing in part of Gujarat, Kaira, and probably Ahmedabad has been furnished to the Excise Commissioner by Mr. B. E. Modi, Deputy Collector:CH. IX.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 165 freely distributing bhang as a charity to all who care to partake is common both at temples and at other places of resort. Berar. 445. In Berar there is evidence as to the use both of ganja and bhang at the Shivratri and Holi festivals and at social gather- ings. The hemp plant itself is not worshipped, but, according to one witness, when a consumer dies, the plant is kept near his corpse during the funeral ceremony. Ajmere-Merwara. 446. At the Holi and the Shivratri and at family festivities the drugs, especially bhang, are used. Baluchistan. 447. Major Gaisford, Deputy Commissioner, states that among the Hindu sect called Bam Bargis the consumption of bhang is regarded as essential. Native States. 448. From Native States there is but little information regarding customs, either social or religious, with which these drugs are connected. No purely local or indigenous customs have been brought to the notice of the Commission, but there is sufficient infor- mation to show that practices similar to those existing in British provinces at the Holi and Shivratri festivals and on occasions of family rejoicings are observed by certain classes of the people in many Native States. Worship of the hemp plant. 449. The custom of worshipping the hemp plant, although not so prevalent as that of offering hemp to Siva and other deities of the Hindus, would nevertheless appear from the state- ments of the witnesses to exist to some extent in some provinces of India. The reason why this fact is not generally known may perhaps be gathered from such statements as that of Pandit Dharma Nand Joshi, who says that such worship is performed in secret. There may be another cause of the denial on the part of the large majority of Hindu witnesses of any knowledge of the existence of a custom of worshipping the hemp plant in that the educated Hindu will not admit that he worships the material object of his adoration, but the deity as represented by it. The custom of worshipping the hemp plant, though not confined to the Himalayan districts or the northern portions of India alone, where the use of the products of the hemp plant is more general among the people, is less known as we go south. Still even far south, in some of the hilly districts of the Madras Presi- dency and among the rural population, the hemp plant is looked upon with some sort of veneration. Mr. J. H. Merriman (witness No. 28, Madras) says: "I know of no custom of worshipping the hemp plant, but believe it is held in a certain sort of veneration by some classes." Mr. J. Sturrock, the Collector of Coimbatorc (witness No. 2, Madras), says: "In some few localities there is a tradition of sanctity attached to the plant, but no regular worship." The Chairman of the Conjeveram Municipal Board, Mr. E. Subramana Iyer (witness No. 143, Madras), says: "There is no plant to be worshipped here, but it is generally used as sacrifices to some of the minor Hindu deities." There is a passage quoted from Rudrayamal Danakand and Karmakand inthe report on the use of hemp drugs in the Baroda State, which also shows that the worship of the bhang plant is enjoined in the Shastras. It is thus stated: "The god Shiva says to Parvati166 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. IX. In Bhabishya Puran it is stated that "on the 13th moon of Chaitra (March and April) one who wishes to see the number of his sons and grandsons increased must worship Kama (Cupid) in the hemp plant, etc." General conclusions. 450. In summing up their conclusions on this chapter, the Commission would first remark that charas, which is a comparatively new article of consumption, has not been shown to be in any way connected with religious observance. As regards Northern India, the Commission are of opinion that the use of bhang is more or less common everywhere in connection with the social and religious customs of the people. As regards ganja, they find that there are certain classes in all parts, except the Punjab, who use the drug in connection with their social and religious observances. The Commission are also of opinion in regard to bhang that its use is considered essential in some religious observances by a large section of the community, and in regard to ganja that those who consider it essential are comparatively very few. The Commission have little doubt that interference with the use of hemp in connection with the customs and observances above referred to would be regard- ed by the consumers as an interference with long established usage and as an encroachment upon their religious liberty. And this feeling would, especially in the case of bhang, undoubtedly be shared to some extent by the people at large. Regarding Southern India, the same remarks apply with this reservation, that the difference between ganja and bhang as materials for smoking and drink- ing respectively is much less marked there, and the distinction between the two forms of the drug is much less clearly recognised, although by the term "bhang" is generally meant the drug as used for drinking, and by "ganja" the drug as used for smoking.
CHAPTER X. EFFECTS168 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. X. conceals the smell. On the whole, then, it is easily intelligible that respectable per- sons should have a very limited knowledge of the consumption of hemp drugs, and especially of the smoking of ganja and charas, except by dissipated or excessive consumers. As might have been anticipated from a careful consideration of the circumstances, the experience of a large number of witnesses, even of those who have seen something of the use of the drugs, is found to be confined to having seen palki-bearers or boatmen smoke in the midst of hard work, or to occasionally seeing a friend indulge. Some other witnesses have only known the habit as practised by such persons as fakirs or by dissipated persons who consume to excess. Some have only seen the drug used when they have gone in the way of duty, or, in pursuance of this inquiry, to shops or other places where smokers resort. The witnesses are very few who have any extensive and accurate acquaintance with consumption. Witnesses were specially warned to confine themselves to what they actually knew, and efforts were made, wherever the evidence seemed to require it, to ascertain whether they had done so. Bias of certain witnesses. 452. In estimating the value of the evidence as to effects, this generally very limited acquaintance with the subject on the part of the witnesses has had to be borne constantly in mind. It has been necessary to decline to accept strong or dogmatic statements on one side or the other without taking pains to ascertain on what basis of fact and actual experience they have been founded. This careful inquiry into the actual basis of statements made has been found necessary also in consideration of the different points of view from which such a question as this may be regarded. Some wit- nesses know only the medicinal use of the drugs, and are prepared to say nothing but good of them, being really ignorant of their use as intoxicants. They know only the use of the drugs as remedial agents, carefully prescribed when necessity arises, or used as a domestic remedy in certain minor ailments. This use is sometimes confounded with the use of the drugs as stimulants or intoxicants. These uses ought to be very carefully discriminated. There are also witnesses who do know the use of the drugs as intoxicants, but know only the moderate use. These have nothing stronger to say of the drugs than would be said of alcohol by the man who only had seen a glass of wine taken at his own table or at the table of a friend. He knows nothing of the effects of excess. Others again have only experience of excessive consumption. The moderate consumer has not attracted their attention. The ruin wrought in certain cases by excess has alone attracted their notice. They feel towards these drugs as that man feels towards alcohol whose experience has been mainly gained among the social wrecks of the lowest parts of a great city. In view of all this, the Commission were careful to do what they could to ascertain the basis of the opinions and closely to examine the facts laid before them. Striking statements made by some of the most careful and intelligent witnesses as to the change in their views when they became aware of the great extent of the moderate consumption of these drugs, the effects of which they had only seen in cases of deplorable excess, will be referred to later on in dealing with insanity and other effects. This ignorance of the effects of hemp drugs on the part of some able, intelligent, and benevolent men, however it may be explained with reference to the above considerations, must still be regarded as indicating that the injury caused by the drugs is com- paratively trifling. It must have attracted more attention had evil effects been at all common in comparison with the extent of consumption.
CH. X.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 169 Ganja and charas compared. 453. Before proceeding to discuss the evidence regarding the effects produced by the drugs, it will be well to notice briefly one or two preliminary questions. One of these is the different effects of the different forms of hemp drugs. Witnesses were requested to compare the effects of ganja and charas, and there is a considerable body of evidence on this subject. Inasmuch as charas is theoretically the pure resin extracted from the hemp plant, and the resin is the active principle in all varieties of the drug, it might be expected that this would be everywhere the strongest form in which the drug is found. But the evidence is not all to this effect. Charas is but little known in Bombay, Madras, Assam, and Burma; and ganja is but little known in the Punjab. In these five provinces, therefore, but few witnesses institute any comparison; and though there are some who have seen the effects of these drugs in different parts of India, yet the views of the majority of witnesses from these provinces who do institute the com- parison must of necessity have but little weight. In the North-Western Provinces, the Central Provinces, and Sind, where both drugs are more or less known, the great majority (six to one) of those who make any distinction in strength between these two forms declare that charas is the stronger. In Bengal, on the other hand, a majority (two to one) of those who discriminate regard ganja as the stronger. Even in these provinces, however, the evidence cannot be accepted with confidence, for it is not usual for ganja and charas to be smoked by the same person. The evidence shows clearly enough that there is no essential difference between charas and ganja, but that the former takes in the Punjab and in parts of the North-Western Provinces the place among intoxicants which is taken by ganja in other parts of India. The only difference in regard to their effects apparent from the evidence is that some witnesses assert one form to be stronger than the other. There are, however, differences of opi- nion among the witnesses as to which is the stronger. The importance of these differ- ences of opinion perhaps lies mainly in the necessity for explaining them. There are two general reasons why some of the witnesses might erroneously regard charas as weaker than ganja170 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94 [CH. X. from 1/100,000 to 1/5,000 part of the body weight being required to produce certain physiological effects, while in three samples of Nepal charas doses equal to 1/2,500 part of the body weight were inactive. These startling figures seem to indicate not only natural deterioration, but also extensive adulteration of charas. Flat, round, and chur ganja. 454. The evidence recorded regarding the effect of the three preparations of ganja (round, flat, and chur) shows clearly that if their effects differ (which is doubtful), the difference is not in kind, but only in degree. There is no difference whatever in kind, and the difference in degree is trifling. Round ganja is practically unknown except in Bengal. There the great majority of the witnesses say that there is no difference even of degree between round and flat ganja. Only forty-one witnesses draw any distinction, and these are pretty equally divided. Some, indeed, think that the manner in which the round ganja is rolled retards deterioration; others that the close packing of the flat ganja has the same effect. The truth seems to be that the preference for one or other of these two preparations is purely a matter of habit and varies in different districts, and that there is little real difference between the effects of these preparations. This is borne out by the experiments conducted by Dr. Prain (vide his report on the cultivation of ganja submitted to the Bengal Government in 1893) and by those of Mr. Hooper, though these two sets of experiments differ somewhat in result. Dr. Prain gave the average percentages of resin extracts from Bengal round and flat ganja for the seasons 1889 to 1893 as 22.27 and 22.13 respectively. His specimens had been reduced to the state of chur. Mr. Hooper found chur to afford 25.90 per cent. of resin extract compared with 23.8, 22.6, and 21.8 for small flat, large flat, and round ganja respectively. In respect to chur the evidence is very much divided and uncertain in tone. So far as it goes, it tends to show that Bengal is the only province where chur is regarded as at least as strong as the unbroken ganja. The explanation of this diversity of opinions is simple. Chur is broken ganja; and ganja may be broken either purposely or accidentally. In many parts and by many witnesses chur is regarded as the broken or refuse ganja which becomes separated in the process of preparation or transport, and which "even the poor will not buy." A second class of witnesses know chur as the best parts of the ganja heads, separated carefully from the woody matter or stalks, and therefore stronger, bulk for bulk, than the ordinary article. A third set of witnesses point out that before being smoked ganja must bo broken; it must become chur before being used. These insist, therefore, that there is no real difference between chur and other ganja. It may be noted, however, that there seems good ground to believe that chur as packed at present deterio- rates more rapidly than the unbroken ganja, and is therefore less popular in at least the more distant markets. Smoking and drinking or eating. 455. The question as to whether the smoking of hemp is more injurious than drinking or eating the drug is of importance mainly in connection with the difference between ganja or charas and bhang. The form in which the question was put by the Commission raised two comparisonsCH. X.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 171 this distinction. At the same time it cannot be said that the evidence is practi- cally clear and decided. Many witnesses feel themselves unable to deal with the matter. A few decline to discriminate between the effects of smoking and those of the other modes of consumption. Well over four hundred witnesses, however, institute a clear comparison. Of these there are over a hundred medi- cal men trained more or less thoroughly according to European methods, of whom four-fifths regard smoking as the most injurious form of consumption. There are over forty practitioners trained after native methods, of whom nearly three-fourths hold the same opinion. There are nearly three hundred non-medical witnesses who are similarly divided. These figures show that the decided majority of such witnesses as have given an opinion regard smoking as the most injurious form of consumption, and this is found to be the case both for all classes of witnesses and for all provinces. The majority is least in Bengal, being precisely two to one in each of the two classes of medical, and rather less than that among the non-medical, witnesses who have recognised any difference. It has also to be borne in mind that among the minority there are some who clearly state that though ganja smoking may be less deleterious than drinking or eating ganja, it is more deleterious than drinking bhang. And there are probably others who hold this view, though they have not thought of stating it. There are some witnesses whose experience is that drinking bhang is a habit which is more likely to go to excess than smoking, because more seductive and more sociable. But there are many others whose experience is precisely the reverse. There are one or two witnesses who think smoking less harmful than drinking hemp, because the latter form of consumption lends itself in their opinion more readily to deleterious mixtures. But there is a great deal of evidence to a precisely opposite effect. There are also some witnesses who emphasise the injurious effects of the excessive use of bhang on the digestive system. But the preponderance of opinion is that excessive smoking of charas or ganja has still more injurious effects on the system. Common experience then as indicated in the evidence of all classes of witnesses seems to teach that smoking ganja or charas is more injurious than taking bhang. There seems no reason to decline to accept this view. The following reasons seem to support it: (a) there is much less of the resin in what is properly known as bhang than in ganja or charas; (b) the products of the destructive distillation of the resin appear to be capable of doing injury, especially if used to excess, and to be carried to the lungs and readily absorbed by the inhalation which is the invariable method of smoking. At the same time no one can read the evidence or observe the facts without realising that the use of bhang, at all events if carried beyond moderation, may also be distinctly injurious. Admixtures. 456. In considering the effects of hemp drugs, it is necessary not to forget the admixtures used more or less frequently with them. These are discussed more fully in other parts of the report. There are certain of them, such as the spices used to render bhang a more palatable drink and also perhaps less irritating to the digestive system, or the almonds used to emulsify the resinous matter in the bhang, or the tobacco used as the most pleasant vehicle and diluent of charas or ganja when smoked, which need not be discussed here. Their effects are unimportant.
172 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. X. But there are certain admixtures which are taken with the hemp drugs, at least ostensibly, with the express purpose of intensifying their effects. Thus opium is sometimes smoked with ganja. This is probably sheer vice, a dissi- pated desire to mix intoxicants. Cantharides and nux vomica are sometimes used in bhang. The object of this is apparently to produce aphrodisiac effects. But nux vomica is also perhaps used thus as a tonic. This drug is apparently sometimes smoked, when its effect would be nullified. Arsenic is similarly used in bhang, probably from a belief in its prophylactic and tonic properties. It is also stated to be smoked with charas or ganja. In this form it would be very poisonous, but the evidence seems to show that it is smoked ostentatiously by jogis and fakirs; and probably it is not really inhaled. It is also sometimes stated that aconite is occasionally smoked. All these admixtures, as well as others of a more exceptional and extraordinary character, appear to be rarely used. More common than any of them is dhatura. It is generally the seeds, but occasionally the leaves, that are used. This drug is used by those debauchees or other excessive consumers who either cannot afford sufficient ganja or bhang, or who desire a stronger form of intoxication than either can supply. There is also some little evidence of the occasional use by those who supply the drink of an infusion of dhatura to strengthen bhang, perhaps sometimes without the knowledge of the consumers. There is a good deal of evidence both generally of the use of this drug by excessive consumers, and also in particular cases of the gradual formation of the dhatura habit when ganja or bhang has failed to satisfy. Dhatura is clearly more strongly intoxicant than the hemp drugs, and there can be little doubt that the evidence which represents it as decidedly more injurious may be accepted as in accordance with fact. There is a strong popular prejudice against this drug, and it is not used by moderate smokers at all. It does not seem likely that it would ever replace hemp drugs any more than it now sup- plements them among moderate consumers, but only among persons who deliber- ately desire intoxication and are indifferent in their choice of intoxicant. At the same time the use of Hyoscyamns muticus (or "Hill bhang of the Western frontier"), already referred to, does indicate the possibility of more general resort to dhatura if ganja were not available. The active principle of this drug is closely allied to that of dhatura in its physiological effects. There are also many witnesses who believe that consumers of the hemp drugs (especially, but not exclusively, excessive consumers) would take to dhatura if they could not obtain the drugs to which they are accustomed, and this opinion is entitled to considerable weight. Dhatura. 457. Dhatura belongs to the same natural order as hyoscyamus and bella- donna. The active principle of dhatura is hyoscya- mine with small quantities of atropine and hyoscine: the active principle of belladonna is atropine with some hyoscyaminc. These three alkaloids are all closely allied in their physiological action. The action of atropine has been fully studied. It is unnecessary, therefore, to say more of the physiological action of dhatura. The leaves, and in even higher degree the seeds, form a very powerful intoxicant; and the delirium which ensues from the use of the drug is well known. The effects of dhatura as introduced into the system through the stomach have hitherto chiefly received attention, but the effects of smoking have also been observed. There have, however, been hitherto no physiological experiments to ascertain the effects produced by the prolonged inhalation of
CH. X.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 173 dhatura smoke. The Commission requested Dr. D. D. Cunningham to conduct such experiments. His report is contained in Vol. III Appendices. The fol- lowing extract is of interest: "The subject of experiment, as in the case of that on the effects of the inhalation of the smoke of ganja, was a fair-sized specimen of Macacus rhesus. The treatment was initiated on the 1st June and continued until 11th July, so that the experiment lasted for a period of about six weeks. In its conduct the same inhalation apparatus was employed as in the first experiment. At the outset the seeds of dhatura were made use of as the source of smoke; but as they appeared to be undesirably potent, leaves were pre- sently substituted for them, and were persistently employed throughout the rest of the experiment. "The symptoms attending the treatment were not invariably quite uniform in character. On some occasions indications of a certain amount of cerebral excitement were present for some time; but, as a rule, drowsiness and gradually increasing intoxication manifested themselves from the outset, either alone or associated with symptoms of irritation of the respiratory apparatus as indicated by coughing. "The animal was killed by means of prolonged administration of chloroform on the morning of the 14th July, and a post-mortem examination conducted at once with the following results:174 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. X- only practised for a relatively brief period, is sufficient to establish serious morbid changes in the cerebral nervous centres, and that it therein differs from the habitual inhalation of the smoke of ganja extending over a much more prolonged period. This clearly indicates the necessity of distinguishing between cases in which ganja alone is employed from those in which a mixture of ganja and dhatura is substituted for it, as otherwise certain prejudicial effects which are really due to the use of the latter drug may be erroneously credited to the former one." Medicinal use. 458. Turning now to the effects of hemp drugs, it seems expedient to take up first their medicinal use. This is not confined to their use as prescribed by physicians, but extends also to their use as popular or domestic remedial agents. Out of a total of 1,193 European and Native witnesses before the Commission, little less than two-thirds refer to the use of hemp drugs by the Vedanti and Yunani schools of native physicians and native doctors generally, while the rest afford no information on the subject or reply in the negative. About one-sixth of the former refer specially to the use of ganja, one-third to bhang, and the remainder state that both forms of the drug are prescribed, several of the wit- nesses in the North-Western Provinces and Punjab particularising charas as a remedial agent. If the number of witnesses who speak of this use in each prov- ince may be taken as approximately indicating its extent, then it would appear that the medicinal use is well known throughout India. Ancient literature. 459. Before alluding to the use of hemp drugs by native physicians in the pre- sent day, the Commission consider that it will perhaps be of interest to give a brief rsum of the medicinal properties assigned to hemp by some of the ancient writers. Mr. George A. Gricr- son, I.C.S., informed the Commission that having searched through all the Sanskrit and Hindi books accessible, he found the first mention of bhanga as a medicine in the work of Suruta, written before the eighth century A.D. Bhanga is recommend- ed with a number of other drugs as an antiphlegmatic. In the same work Mr. Grierson points out that vijaya is mentioned as a remedy for catarrh accompanied by diarrhCH. X.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 175 tion, intoxication, the power of the voice, and the digestive faculty." In the Rajarallabha, a materia medica of rather later date, ganja is described as "Indra's food," is acid, produces infatuation, and destroys leprosy. It "creates energy, the mental powers, and internal heat, corrects irregularities of the phlegm- atic humour, and is an elixir vit." In the Makhzan-el-Adwiya, hemp seeds are said to be "a compound of opposite qualities, cold and dry in the third degree, i.e., stimulant and sedative, imparting at first a gentle reviving heat, and then a considerable refrigerant effect." The qualities of the plant are stimulant and sedative. "The leaves make a good snuff for deterging the brain; the juice of the leaves applied to the head as a wash removes dandruff and vermin; drops of the juice thrown into the ear allay pain and destroy worms and insects. It checks diarrh176 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. X. when ganja is used for local fumigation, the smoke from the unmixed drug is employed. These two drugs appear to be rarely used for internal administration.. Occasionally an oil prepared with ganja and other ingredients is used as a rubefacient. The expressed oil from the seeds is also used for a similar purpose. Treatment of disease. 461. In discussing the diseases treated, we may take first diseases of the ner- vous system. Witnesses refer to the use of the drugs in the treatment of "brain fever," cramps, convul- sions of children, headache, hysteria, neuralgia, sciatica, and tetanus. In certain of these diseases, e.g., convulsions of children, neuralgia, and tetanus, the use of hemp preparations has also been advocated by European practitioners. The late Sir W. B. O'Shaughnessy, of Calcutta, appears to have been the first to use hemp resin in tetanus. He found that in many cases it effectually arrested the progress of the disease, but in the hands of others equally good results were not always obtained. O 'Shaughnessy explains this by the fact that the use of hemp is so universal among the lower classes, that it is only in those patients who are not habi- tuated to it that beneficial effects are likely to ensue when the drug is administer- ed medicinally. The treatment of tetanus by the inhalation of ganja smoke has also been recommended. In the class of specific infectious diseases, hemp drugs are stated to be used in hydrophobia, ague, remittent fever, cholera,"to relieve burning symptoms in phthisis," dysentery, erysipelas, and gonorrhCH. X.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 177 from bhang and other ingredients is prescribed in white leprosy, and bhang smok- ing is stated to be used against the poisons of fish and scorpions. Therapeutics. 462. In connection with the therapeutics of hemp drugs, one of the common- est uses is for the relief of pain, the drugs being used either as local or general anodynes. Thus bhang poultices are frequently mentioned as soothing local applications to painful parts; and poultices are used for inflamed piles and over the seat of pain in liver and bowel diseases, and to check inflammation and erysipelas. Fumigation with the smoke from burning ganja or bhang is also used as a local sedative in piles. A small fragment of charas is placed in a carious tooth to relieve tooth- ache. And the use of the drugs is also referred to for the relief of protracted labour pains, dysmenorrh178 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. X. bronchial mucous membrane, leading to increased secretion, and resulting in the condition which is described as chronic bronchitis in ganja smokers. Whether true asthma can be induced by hemp drug smoking, the Commission consider open to much doubt. It appears to them highly probable that the drugs are smoked in the first instance for the relief of that disease. On the other hand, it is well known that frequent asthmatic seizures result in emphysema of the lungs and attendant bronchi- tis; and possibly most cases of hemp drug bronchitis are associated with emphyse- ma, induced partly by the strain mechanically thrown on the lungs in smoking, and partly as a result of the chronic bronchitis. So that in considering the CH. X.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 179 short the cold stage in fever. There appears to be but little doubt that when bhang is used by natives in fever, the benefit accrues on account of its diuretic action, and not because it possesses any real febrifuge properties. It is not known to possess the latter. Tonic and other effects. 465. The tonic, digestive, stimulant, antispasmodic, astringent, and alterative effects of the drugs are mentioned by some witnesses. It is probably on account of the supposed hmosta- tic effect that powdered charas is used as an application to cuts to check bleed- ing and induce healing, and possibly the use of the drugs in menorrhagia is based on similar reasoning. In this connection, however, it is interesting to note that Dr. R. L. Dey, a medical officer of the Eastern Bengal State Railway, in 1866 reported the successful treatment of a number of cases of obstinate menorrhagia with tincture of Indian hemp and liquid extract of ergot, although he could obtain no benefit from the use of ergot administered with sulphuric and gallic acids and other hmostatics. The use of the drug as an ecbolic is also mentioned. According to Still and Maisch (National Dispensatory), there is evidence to show that Cannabis appears capable, directly or indirectly, of causing uterine contraction, as in many cases of uterine hmorrhage, and it is also said to cause contraction in the pregnant uterus with as much energy as ergot, but with less persistent action. Some witnesses refer to the purgative action; it is quite possible that a chillum of ganja may act in the same way as the morning pipe does with many Europeans. Aphrodisiac action. 466. The use of the drug in cases of impotency is, no doubt, based on its supposed aphrodisiac effects. The experiments of Prof. Wood indicate that the drug does not possess any aphrodisiac power; and Lauder Brunton remarks ("Text-book of Pharmacy, Therapeutics, and Pharmacology"): "Cannabis indica has been regarded as an aphrodisiac, but the trials of it made in this country seem to show that it does not, itself at least, have any such action, and merely induces a condition of partial delirium in which Easterns may possibly have visions of a sexual nature, and indeed they try to give a sexual direction to the mental disturbance which the Can- nabis produces by mixing with it musk, ambergris, or cantharides." O'Shaugh- nessy, on the other hand, speaks of the drug acting on the "generative apparatus," and in experiments, which he tried on some of his pupils, he states that, "with scarcely any exception, great aphrodisia was experienced" from administration of the extract. Physiologically the active principle of hemp drugs has, so far as is known, no aphrodisiac power whatever; and, as a matter of fact, they are used by ascetics in this country with the ostensible object of destroying sexual appe- tite. But taken as a stimulant to assist in the execution of a specific purpose, its indirect effect is perfectly intelligible. Like alcohol it gives strength and free course to the predominant desires of the animal nature. This effect will be considered more fully later. Meanwhile it is enough to say that the alleged aphrodisiac action seems to be merely the indirect effect of the drug as a stimulant. This effect explains the use of these drugs in the houses of prostitutes, regarding which there is a good deal of evidence, just as alcohol in one form or another isused in similar houses in Europe. The following are some of the minor cases to which ganja is applied. Occa- sionally the drug is burnt as a disinfectant and used in lieu of carbolic acid. Itis also applied to sores for healing, and ganja ash is used to stop ulceration. By

Regarding the use of hemp drugs in the treatment of cattle-disease, out of a total of 1,193 witnesses, one-half give no infor- mation; and of the rest rather over one-half speak to the use of bhang alone, while the remainder speak generally of the use of both ganja and bhang. A few witnesses speak only of the use of ganja, but that is main- ly where bhang is not available. This use of the drugs is in evidence in all prov- inces, though naturally to a less extent in Bombay and Madras than elsewhere, and least of all in Burma. Among the diseases for which hemp drugs are prescribed in native veterinary practice for cattle, horses, sheep, and occasionally elephants may be mentioned colic, bowel-complaints, diarrhCH. X.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 181 consider the popular use and its effects apart from the medicinal use. A drug may be a useful medicine, but a bad thing to allow into the market freely for general consumption. The evidence regarding the popular use has now to be considered. There are only about fifty witnesses who assert that no benefit whatever can be derived by consumers from the moderate use of any form of these drugs. The vast majority assert that in some one or other of their forms they may produce at least temporarily beneficial effects. Many even of those who regard the use of the drugs as on the whole baneful admit such temporary benefits. It is to be noted, however, that, with the very rarest exceptions, the evidence points to the use of the drugs by males only. Women would therefore appear either not to require or to be denied the benefits ascribed to the drugs. Food accessory or digestive. 469. Among the beneficial effects attributed to the drugs is their effect as a food accessory or digestive. This effect is more generally attributed to bhang than to the other two forms. But there are a large number of witnesses who attribute it also to the smoking of ganja. The "cooling and refreshing" cup of bhang taken by the well-to-do, especially in the hot weather, to stimulate their energies and to create an appetite for food is frequently in evidence. There would seem to be a very general use of bhang in moderation as a stimulant and digestive by the middle classes, especially in advancing years. Some of the most intelligent and enterprising classes of the community are among those who thus use bhang. This use is generally spoken of without any marked condemnation, and often even with approval; for it is the practice of the respectable classes. But after all there seems quite equally good ground for believing that the chil- lum of ganja taken by the labouring man after his food with the object of allay- ing weariness and assisting digestion is no more harmful; and there are many witnesses whose evidence is in this sense. The use of bhang in the one case is sometimes compared to the glass of wine taken at meals by a moderate consumer of alcohol, and the use of ganja in the other case to the labour- ing man's glass of beer or even to his pipe of tobacco. It is possible also that the effects of hemp drugs in this respect may be to a certain extent comparable with those of tea. In connection with the most recent experiments on the subject, the action of tea is thus described by Dr. Edward Smith: "It increases the assimilation of food both of the flesh and heat forming kind, and with abundance of food must promote nutrition, whilst in the absence of sufficient food it increases the waste of the body." If there is any- thing in this comparison, Dr. Smith's remarks regarding tea may throw some light on the statements frequently found in the evidence regarding the necessity for sufficient or nourishing food to prevent injury to the constitution from the prolonged use of hemp drugs. To give staying-power. 470. The use of these drugs to give staying-power under severe exertion or exposure or to alleviate fatigue is very largely in evid- ence. Here it is ganja especially which is credit- ed with these beneficial effects. For ganja is far more extensively used than bhang by the labouring classes. The latter is mainly used by persons like the Chaubes of Mathra, who are very frequently referred to, and professional wrestlers. Gymnasts, wrestlers and musicians, palki-bearers and porters, divers and postal runners, are examples of the classes who use the hemp drugs on occa- sions of especially severe exertion. Fishermen and boatmen, singhara cultivators 46
182 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. X. working in tanks, dhobis and night watchmen, mendicants and pilgrims, are named as among those who use them under severe exposure. All classes of labourers, especially such as blacksmiths, miners, and coolies, are said more or less generally to use the drugs as a rule in moderation to alleviate fatigue. In this connection a reference to Dr. Cunningham's experiment described in Vol. III Appendices is interesting. Febrifuge. 471. There is also a large body of evidence showing that hemp drugs, both as smoked and as drunk, are used as a febrifuge or preventive of the diseases common in malarious tracts or arising from the use of bad water. This is the justification alleged for the habitual use of these drugs in certain localities. Here, of course, the experience of the witnesses is more limited; but the evidence is very considerable. Labourers in malarious tracts and cultivators of wet and marshy lands, jungle tribes, and those who have to work or reside in jungle tracts, are among those who are said to use the drugs for these purposes. It is impossible also to shut the eyes to the evidence which often comes up unexpectedly, showing that respectable and intelli- gent people going on duty to such tracts, and sepoys sent on foreign service or garrisoning comparatively unhealthy districts, often take to these drugs for these purposes. Other beneficial effects. 472. There are a few other effects of a beneficial character which are referred to by certain witnesses. They are, however, of a less important character and less generally contem- plated than those which have been already considered. Thus the drugs are said to be used sometimes to prevent insomnia and to relieve anxiety, as the consumer of alcohol sometimes takes a "night cap before going to bed" or a glass of wine when he is of heavy heart. The drugs are said to be cheering in their effects, and to be prized by many on this account. An interesting illustration of this may perhaps be found in the popular belief existing in many parts that these drugs protect against cholera and other epidemic diseases. One very intelligent witness, who has seen much of this use, explains it as due to the stimulating and inspiriting nature of the drugs. The drugs are said to be used to produce concentration of attention not only by fakirs, but also by such tradesmen as jewellers doing very fine work. They are said to be used by the poor and on occasion by others to alleviate hunger when suffi- cient food is not obtainable. The alleged occasional use in this way by sepoys, who for any reason cannot devote a sufficient amount of their pay to procuring food, is interesting. One witness (Mr. E. J. Ebden, Collector of Ahmednagar) thus refers to this: "I am told on good authority that native soldiers who have gambled away their pay employ the ganja pipe as a cheap substitute for food until in funds again." Want of money from other causes might lead to the same practice; and the evidence shows that the practice is not confined to sepoys. It is especially found among wandering mendicants, and no doubt exists among other classes. The practice cannot result in permanent advantage, but the temporary relief is not to be overlooked. Contrary evidence. 473. There are a few witnesses who stigmatize all such allegations of bene- ficial results as mere excuses made for a vicious indulgence. As some opium consumers attribute all manner of good effects to opium, liquor drinkers to alcohol, and tobacco smokers to tobacco, so do consumers of hemp attribute these beneficial effects to their
CH. X.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 183 favourite drug. It is, no doubt, true that there is a tendency to find excuse for an unnecessary indulgence. But the medicinal uses of these drugs lend at least some measure of support to the popular belief among consumers that some beneficial effects do follow from the moderate use. There are one or two witnesses who assert that the use of these drugs, far from being a protection against malaria, makes the consumer more liable to its influence. This may be true of the excessive use, which may injure the constitution and predispose to noxious influences. There is, however, no sufficient ground for believing that it is true of the moderate use. Other witnesses assert that the effect in alleviating fatigue is merely temporary, and results in the end in greater exhaustion. So far as the moderate use is concerned, this view would appear to be mainly theoreti- cal; for, as has been already pointed out, there are very few witnesses who even profess to have any experience of evil effects resulting from moderate consumption. There are also a number of witnesses who attribute these good effects to bhang only, while some limit them to the occasional use of the drugs. These statements may perhaps be taken for practical purposes together. The occasional use of ganja or charas must be rare compared with the occasional use of bhang; for the smoking habit is more difficult to acquire, and there are therefore few who can with comfort indulge in it only occasionally. The truth seems to be that while, no doubt, these drugs are more commonly consumed merely as stimulants than from any clearly defined idea of their bene- ficial results, yet they are popularly believed to have (if moderately used) some such beneficial results as have been above described. Moderate consumers believe this, and would feel a sense of deprivation if they were unable to obtain what they regard as a beneficial stimulant. This deprivation would be more felt among the poorer classes than among the wealthier, whose tastes lead them to more expensive luxuries. It is the poorer people and the labouring classes who as a rule use these drugs for the purposes indicated. They are admittedly as a rule moderate consumers. They do not seem to exceed in the use of hemp so frequently as in the use of liquor. Those who seem, according to the state- ments of many witnesses, really to derive no benefit but only harm from the use of these drugs are those who, leading sedentary or idle lives, take the drugs from a merely vicious desire of nervous excitement, and have a strong tendency to excess. Is moderate use harmless ? Charas. 474. The fact that certain beneficial effects result from the moderate use un- der certain circumstances is not, however, necessarily inconsistent with the view that even the moderate use is on the whole injurious. Witnesses were therefore invited to consider separately the question if the moderate use of these drugs is on the whole harmless. About eight hundred and fifty witnesses (i.e., considerably more than two-thirds of the whole) record their opinion. Of these, over sixty declare that the moderate use cannot be regarded as harmless simply on the ground that it is apt to develop into excess. The remainder (about eight hundred) answer the question clearly in the affirmative or negative for each of the forms of the drugs with which they are acquainted. Nearly three hundred witnesses deal with charas, and their opinion is as four to three against that drug. It is in the Punjab, Sind, and the North- Western Provinces that opinion is strongest in this direction. It is in these provinces that charas is best known, and elsewhere
184 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. X. the drug is probably weaker from deterioration. So that opinion in these prov- inces is probably entitled to more weight than elsewhere. On the whole, then, there is apparently a more unfavourable opinion of charas than of the other forms of hemp drugs. Ganja. 475. In regard to ganja, opinion is about seven to five in favour of the moder- ate use being harmless. In every province, except the North-Western Provinces and Sind, the majority take this view. In Sind the drug is known to but few witnesses, and a large pro- portion of these few fail to discriminate between the moderate and excessive use. In the North-Western Provinces the drug is well known, and the witnesses are divided as three to two against the drugCH. X.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 185 pany of smokers. The first effects produced in the novice by the drug, espe- cially if smoked, are also far from pleasant, and must tend to make the habit somewhat difficult to acquire. The first effects of bhang need not be un- pleasant if the consumer is careful to begin with very small doses. But it is other- wise with hemp smoking. To produce any effect, the smoke has to be taken into the lungs by strong inhalation. The effect of this is often unpleasant and dis- tressing, especially to those who are not accustomed to smoke tobacco in this particular way. It is doubtful, however, whether these first effects are ever more deterrent in character than those which European lads experience on their first acquaintance with tobacco, and it cannot be said that they present any real difficulty in the way of those who from any motive desire to consume these drugs. Once these initial difficulties are past, the habit is easily formed. As in the case of every other intoxicant, consumption tends to become habitual. Strength of habit. 479. The pretty general belief is that the habit is not easily broken off when once formed; but the difficulty is not believed to be so great as in the case of either alcohol or opium. It is apparently greater than in the case of tobacco. The experience of our jails seems clearly to confirm the general opinion that the opium habit takes a much stronger hold than the ganja habit, and that no injurious physical effects follow the compulsory cessation of the latter. But even the moderate habitual consumer looks for the effect which he associates with the drug, and finds it a considerable effort to give up the habit186 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. X. accessory, or as a stimulant in hard work, does not seem to be prone to excess. Apparently also the tendency is much less towards that occasional excess which in the case of alcohol so frequently becomes habitual. The working man, for example, does not seem to have the same temptation to a debauch with ganja as with alcohol. Hereditary tendency. 481. Another question of some interest that has arisen in connection with the hemp drug habit, whether moderate or excessive, is the question whether it is hereditary. No evid- ence of the smallest value is forthcoming to show that it is. There are, no doubt, witnesses who state this as their belief; but the basis of that belief is merely the undoubted fact that in many cases the sons of ganja smokers also themselves smoke ganja. This fact is sufficiently explained in the first instance by the universal tendency of sons to imitate their fathers. It has also to be borne in mind that it is an acknowledged fact that the neurotic diathesis which is hereditary frequently exhibits itself in a tendency to indulge in stimulants. The weakness which may have led the father to indulgence in ganja may be inherited by the son, and produce in him the same tendency to use this drug; but there is no such evidence as would justify the opinion that the indulgence is itself hereditary. Physiological action of the drugs. 482. In proceeding to deal more directly with the effects induced by the moderate use of the drugs, the Commission con- sider it desirable to preface the general analysis of information obtained from ordinary witnesses by a rsum of the known physiological action of the drugs as determined by competent observers. The earliest experiments of which we possess any record were instituted on ani- mals by Sir William B. O'Shaughnessy. Ten grains of Nepalese charas were given to a middling sized dog; in half an hour the dog was stupid and sleepy, dozing at intervals, starting up, wagging his tail as if extremely contented, and ate food greed- ily. On being called to, he staggered to and fro, and his face assumed a look of utter and helpless drunkenness. These symptoms lasted two hours and then gra- dually passed away, and in six hours the dog was perfectly well and lively. In another experiment twenty grains of alcoholic extract of ganja were given to a very small dog. In fifteen minutes he was intoxicated: in half an hour he had great difficulty of movement: in an hour he had lost all power over the hinder extremities, which were rather stiff, but flexible: sensibility did not seem to be impaired, and the circulation was natural. He readily acknowledged calls by an attempt to rise up. In four hours he was quite well. O'Shaughnessy conducted experiments on carnivorous as well as graminivorous animals, and found that the former invariably and speedily exhibited the intoxicating influence of the drug, while the latter experienced but trivial effects from any dose administered. As a result of several experiments on pupils at the Medical College, Calcutta, O'Shaughnessy ob- serves: "The result of several trials was that in as small doses as 1/4 of a grain the pulse was increased in fulness and frequency; the surface of the body glowed; the appetite became extraordinary; vivid ideas crowded the brain; unusual loquacity occurred; and, with scarcely any exception, great aphrodisia was experienced." Lauder Brunton states: "Its chief effect is on the brain, and is of a twofold nature; it excites a form of delirium and hallucinations, usually followed by deep sleep. Small doses give rise to delirium with hallucinations generally of a gay character causing much merriment, accompanied by a great inclination to mus-
CH. X.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 187 cular movement. The nature of the hallucinations depends greatly on the charac- ter of the individual, and people seem to be able to determine their nature as in the case of opium. The dreams produced by Indian hemp in inhabitants of Eastern countries are usually of a sexual character, but when taken by more civilized people of Western nations they are not sexual, and are often of a disagree- able nature. During this stage of hallucination the person may conduct himself rationally, and answer clearly any question put to him. The drug produces in some persons a curious loss of sense of space and time. This stage is generally followed by deep sleep. The sensory nerves are benumbed, and there is frequent tingling and partial ansthesia. The pupil is dilated. Respiration may be either quickened or slowed. The action on the pulse is very uncertain. Usually it is at first quickened, then slowed, sometimes vice vers. The temperature rises or sinks according as the drug produces muscular movement or sleep. The urine is increased. The processes of digestion are less altered by Cannabis indica than by opium, and the after effects of opium (nausea, headache, etc.) are not produced." Dr. Russell (Bengal witness No. 105), in his note furnished to Dr. Prain, gives the following effects of "doses pushed to produce a decided effect": "Mental effects appear in from three to five minutes; exhilaration and excitement of a pleasing nature: the subject talkative and merry; laughs and gesticulates; plays on imaginary musical instruments and sings; converses with imaginary per- sons; illusions and delusions, usually of a pleasing nature; objective of these very responsive to external impressions and suggestions; rarely quarrelsome or combative. Then ensues a condition of repose and quiet contemplation with fixed stare and immobile pupil. Then drowsiness and restless sleep in from two to three hours, lasting several hours: on waking, dulness, heaviness, profound depres- sion, and irritability lasting for many hours. Physical effects in stage of exhi- laration188 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. X. dose, if sufficiently large, could be relied on to produce sleep deep enough to mask or prevent the development of sensory-motor disturbance, with the excep- tion of the rocking movements." Dr. Bovill (Bengal witness No. 109) describes the effects of smoking ganja in cigarettes, and Assistant Surgeon J. E. Bocarro (Sind witness No. 20) gives notes in which he compares the effects of drinking bhang and smoking ganja and charas. Dr. Cunningham's experiment on ganja inhalation. 483. The following interesting account of an experiment on the effects of the systematic inhalation of the smoke of ganja conduct- ed by Dr. D. D. Cunningham at the request of the Commission is extracted from his report (Vol. III Appendices). The growth of the habit, the uneasiness arising from privation, the symptoms of the intoxication, especially the appearance of optical delusions, the absence of appre- ciable indication of cerebral excitement, and the post-mortem appearances, are most interesting features of the report. So far as one experiment can be accepted as establishing anything, and subject also to the more careful histo- logical enquiry to be conducted hereafter, this experiment gives additional evid- ence of the absence of morbid changes in the brain and of tissue changes generally under the action of hemp drugs even when used in excess. At the same time the general features of the experiment as indicated above are on the whole comparable with the effects of the hemp drugs on the human consumer as estab- lished in the evidence recorded by the Commission. The remarks of Dr. Cunningham regarding the diminution of appetite accompanied by local accumulations of fat as indicating the diminution in activity of the normal pro- cesses of tissue waste under the influence of ganja throw light on the evidence of witnesses who ascribe beneficial effects to this drug in cases of severe exertion without sufficient or suitable food. Dr. Cunningham writes:CH. X.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 189 consisted in steadily increasing drowsiness leading on to quiet sleep. During the course of exposure the conjunctiva and eyelids frequently became consider- ably congested; but this may, of course, have been merely dependent on direct irritation incident on their contact with the smoke. When removed from the chamber, ere profound sleep had supervened, the animal was evidently intoxicated. In many cases he was incapable of sitting up without supporting himself by means of grasping the bars of his cage, and, when less profoundly affected, was very unsteady on his legs. On being introduced into his cage, he not unfre- quently, either at once or after a short delay, lay down and slept quietly for some time. On awaking from such sleep, as well as in those cases where sleep did not intervene, he almost invariably showed symptoms which appeared to indicate that he was for some time the subject of optical delusions. He gazed about attentively in directions in which nothing which seemed likely to excite his curiosity was present, and carefully scrutinized the floor of his cage for objects which did not exist. Such symptoms continued to persist for a considerable time after all other indications of intoxication had disappeared, continuing to manifest themselves in greater or less degree during the entire course of the latter portion of any day on which the treatment had been administered in the morning. "On a certain number of occasions, however, the symptoms did not follow this normal course. On these the onset of signs of drowsiness was greatly delayed, and had hardly begun to show itself ere the animal was suddenly seized with violent general convulsions, and immediately thereafter became profoundly unconscious. The symptoms on the recovery of consciousness in no way differ- ed from those in cases where the earlier ones had followed the normal course. No satisfactory explanation of the occurrence of such exceptional phenomena could be arrived at, and it must remain uncertain whether they are to be regard- ed as the consequence of certain temporary subjective peculiarities on the part of the animal or of variations in the quality of the drug. "In no instance was there any appreciable indication of the development of any cerebral excitement either during the administration of the drug or after intoxication had been fully established. The normal symptoms were those of simple drowsiness and loss of will-power accompanied by optical delusions, those characterising the exceptional cases of temporary abnormal activity of the spinal cord and basal ganglia which may very probably have been dependent on dimi- nution in the inhibitory power of the higher cerebral centres. "The general health of the animal remained excellent during the entire course of the experiment, save for a period during the months of April and May, in which it suffered from dysenteric symptoms. The occurrence of these, however, can- not be in any way definitely ascribed to the use of the drug, as they are of frequent occurrence among monkeys in confinement apart from any special treatment. The only permanent appreciable effect resulting from the treatment manifested itself in the form of a very considerable diminution in appetite for food, which set in shortly after the initiation of the experiment, and thereafter remained persistent throughout its entire course. "At the desire of the Hemp Drugs Commission, the experiment was brought to a close on the day following my return to Calcutta on the 12th of July 1894. Death was induced by means of prolonged administration of chloroform, and a 48
190 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. X. post-mortem examination was conducted immediately it had occurred. The results of this were as follows, in so far as mere casual naked-eye inspection goes; for I have already pointed out the detailed histological examination of the con- dition of the various organs and tissues is a matter not of a few hours, but of many weeks' work; so that it has been impossible for me to carry it out and at the same time to meet the wish of the Commission for the immediate submission of a report. Specimens of all the more important organs have, however, been carefully preserved, and will form the subjects of detailed histological examination hereafter. "Results of post-mortem examination of the animal.CH. X.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 191 a single experiment afford any ground for inference, it would appear that the most important effect of the habitual employment of inhalations of the smoke of ganja is to give rise to diminution in the normal processes of tissue-waste to such a degree that local accumulations of fat are liable to occur even in spite of the coincident and similarly originating diminution in the ingestion of food. The diminution in activity of the normal processes of tissue waste tends, on the one hand, to give rise to decreased ingestion of food, and, on the other, to local accumulation of fat in spite of this. But if the habitual practice of inhalations of the drug really do produce such effects, it is clear that, in place of being hurtful, it may be positively beneficial to people who are obliged to undergo exertions without having the means of procuring a diet fully adapted to make good the amount of tissue waste normally associated with them. As has been already pointed out, it is necessary to exercise extreme caution in coming to any definite conclusions from the experiment, first, because it is an isolated one, and, second, because the post-mortem examination has not yet been histologically completed; but the evidence which it has afforded is, in so far as it goes, rather in favour of the use of the drug under certain conditions than adverse to it." All three forms of the drug con- sidered together. 484. In considering the effects induced by drinking bhang and smoking charas or ganja, it must be remembered that the same active principle is present in all. The effects, therefore, induced by any one of the three drugs must necessarily depend upon the content of active principle, which is smallest in the case of bhang, and, theoretically at least, largest in charas, weight for weight. Practically it is impossible to compare with anything approaching to accuracy the physiolo- gical effects of the three drugs, because at present no definite active prin- ciple has been isolated. The alcoholic or other extracts from bhang, ganja, and charas are neither chemically similar in composition nor physiologically equiva- lent, weight for weight, in the effects they induce; and it is only possible, therefore, to approximately compare the physiological effects of ganja, charas, and bhang inter se. When, in addition to these initial difficulties, the disturbing factors, racial and individual idiosyncrasy and habit, come into operation, the question of the immediate effects of the drug becomes a most complex problem to deal with scientifically, or indeed even to generalize on in the broadest sense of the term. And, moreover, though the same active principle is originally present in all three of the drugs, yet when either ganja or charas is smoked, the active principle, not being volatile, must undergo decomposition, new products being evolved. Strictly, therefore, there can be no comparison between the physiological effect of the drug when introduced into the stomach as bhang and the products of the destructive distillation of ganja or charas when smoked and inhaled. And a writer on hemp drugs aptly remarks: "The action of hemp on man is so various that when we read the several descriptions given, differing so widely, we would scarcely suppose we were considering the same agent." Immediate effects. 485. Judging from the replies of several witnesses, the immediate effect of the moderate use of any of the hemp drugs on the habitual consumer is refreshing and stimulating, and alleviates fatigue, giving rise to pleasurable sensations all over the nervous system, so that the consumer is "at peace with everybody"192 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. X. pleasure, vigour, ready wit, capacity for hard work, and sharpness for busi- ness; it has a quieting effect on the nervous system, and removes restlessness and induces forgetfulness of mental troubles; all sorts of grotesque ideas rapidly pass through the mind, with a tendency to talk; it brightens the eyes, and, like a good cigar, gives content; the man feels jolly, sings songs, and tells good stories; it causes bravery in the brave and cowardice in the timid, and, like alcohol, brings out the real character of the man. In young men it may give rise to sensual thoughts, and aphrodisiac effects are mentioned. Some witnesses, on the contrary, state that the drug is not refreshing, and that the consumer is sometimes sleepy and sometimes talkative; or there is no tendency to talk: the conjunctiva become suffused and red, and the moisture dries in the throat and lips; the man becomes peevish, stupefied, sees double; and occasionally it may |cause vomiting. Regarding the question of intoxication, witnesses speak of exhilaration and slightly dizzy sensation; a little intoxication, but no stupefaction; a feeling of "briskness" followed by sinking, but no stupefaction; a little heaviness in the eyes, slight narcotic effects, or stupor more or less complete. Others say that the first effect is exciting, then soothing; while some describe the effects as those of intoxication of varying degrees, from moderate to dead drunk. According to certain witnesses, the intoxication of hemp drugs differs from the alcoholic in that only those unaccustomed to the drug are affected, or that intoxication is not much marked in old consumers. Some witnesses state that the drugs allay hunger; others that these effects only result from excessive use; while others deny the power of the drug to allay hunger under all conditions apparently. Similar contradictory statements are made in connection with the alleged power of the drug to create appetite. On this point, however, it may be of interest to note that O'Shaughnessy, as a result of observation, records the fact that hemp drugs in small doses possess an extraordinary power of stimulating the digestive organs: "the appetite became extraordinary" is the remark he makes in describing the symptoms induced in certain of his students by the administration of 1/4 grain doses of the resin. A Sind witness, No. 16, says: "It sharpens the appetite, and in this respect the action of the drug is certain and to be depend- ed on." These are the immediate effects mentioned in the evidence. No doubt some of them would only result from an unaccustomed or excessive dose. Duration of these effects. 486. In connection with the period during which the effects last, it is very diffi- cult to arrive at any general conclusions, as so much depends on individual idiosyncrasy, on habit, dosage, and on the manner in which the drug is exhibited. According to Dr. Russell's experiments, the mental effects appear in from three to five minutes, and the drowsiness and restless sleep may last several hours in cases in which the drug was pushed to produce decided effects. Assistant Surgeon J. E. Bocarro gives fifteen minutes as the period at which intoxication commences after ganja smoking; in the case of charas, with the first pull at the chillum. In the case of ganja, the effects last from half to one hour or much longer, and in charas from fifteen to twenty minutes. With bhang the symptoms may set in from twenty to thirty minutes, or may be much delayed; and, according to Assistant Surgeon Bocarro, may last on an average two hours, or, according to a Bombay medical witness (No. 91), six to twelve hours. According to Dr. Russell's Assam experiments, the effects of two drachms of bhang drunk as goonta came on slowly and disappeared in three hours. With a solution of the resin in alcohol, thirty drops of the tincture
CH. X.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 193 are stated to have induced slight excitement within half a minute, lasting for a few seconds. In fifteen minutes a feeling something allied to the early stage of intoxi- cation came on. Three grains of extract gave rise to no symptoms for one hour (Medical Times and Gazette, 1852). Speaking generally, however, smoking produces far quicker effects than the exhibition of the drug by the stomach, as in the latter case in India the resin in bhang is associated with a large amount of inert insoluble matter, and absorption is thereby delayed; but with pure resin, administered in a finely divided state, absorption from the stomach may occur with great rapidity. After effects. 487. Various replies are given regarding the after effects induced by the drugs. A very common answer to this question is that no immediate after effects are induced. Others say that "scarcely" any after effects follow the moderate use. Dr. Crombie (Bengal witness No. 104) says: "I have not seen any after effects in these cases, and have spent days in company with native boatmen habitually using ganja in moderation." Another witness states (Sind No. 20): "With bhang none of any importance. Ganja and charas, especially the latter, give rise to a dull frontal headache, singing in the ears, weakened mental power, much thirst, impair the appetite, constipate the bowels, and concentrate the urine." Other witnesses describe the after effects as laziness and languor, stupor, drowsiness, melancholy, weakness, laxity of the body, disinclination to do anything, exhaustion, depression, pains in the body, headache, giddiness, and gnawing at the stomach, nauseous taste in the stomach, and thirst. O'Shaughnessy gives a succinct account of the after effects of bhang and charas. In the case of bhang, "the in- toxication lasts about three hours, when sleep supervenes; no nausea or sickness of stomach succeeds, nor are the bowels at all affected: next day there is slight giddiness and vascularity of the eyes, but no other symptoms worth recording." In the case of ganja, "heaviness, laziness, and agreeable reveries ensue, but the person can be easily roused, and is able to discharge routine occupations, such as pulling the punkah, waiting at table, etc." The Commission consider it very probable that in regard to the after effects of the moderate use of these drugs, the evil after effects described by some witnesses are really due to the excessive use, and that witnesses have not always discriminated between the effects of the moderate and excessive use of the drugs. Replies to the question whether the want of subsequent gratification pro- duces any longing or uneasiness are answered by some witnesses in the negative as regards moderate consumers; others say that a little longing or even uneasi- ness is experienced for want of gratification. There appear to be no valid reasons why the want of gratification of even a moderate habit should not cause "uneasi- ness" in some cases, and a "sensation of longing" in many: it is certainly the case with the majority of habitual moderate tobacco smokers, in whom the want of an accustomed smoke certainly does produce "longing," and which may even amount to "uneasiness" in some instances. In no case, however, is the longing or uneasiness experienced by users of hemp drugs for want of subsequent gratifi- cation comparable to the cravings of an opium smoker or eater. This matter has, however, already been discussed in dealing with the formation of the habit. 49
194 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. X. Classes who use the drugs as stimulants. 488. There are few, if any, classes of the community some members of which do not use hemp drugs in some form. There are reli- gious objections to the use of intoxicants by Muham- madans, and these deter such of this class as are orthodox from indulging in these drugs. Many of the Hindus who are both orthodox and respectable consider it contrary to their religion to indulge in these or any other intoxicants, though many of the same class also believe that they may, at least occasionally at feasts, take bhang. Orthodox Sikhs do not smoke, and therefore regard ganja and charas as prohibited, though they do not see the same religious objection to drink- ing bhang. These are illustrations of classes which generally abstain. Members even of these classes are, however, found among the consumers of these drugs. It may be said probably with safety that there is no class of the community that does not to some extent partake of these drugs. At the same time consumption is in the main confined to particular classes. Ganja or charas is chiefly used by (I) "religious" persons, such as fakirs and wandering mendicants, sadhus and pandahs, the followers of Trinath, and other sects; (2) the lower classes of both Hindus and Muhammadans, such as artizans and cultivators, fishermen and boat- men, palki-bearers and day labourers, sepoys and night watchmen, wrestlers and athletes, Chamars and Domes, and others of the lower orders; (3) domestic servants of all kinds, especially those who, as syces, durwans, or dhobis, have especially trying work to do; (4) aborigines of different races, such as Sonthals, Gonds, and many more; (5) tradesmen, Kayasths, and others of the lower middle classes. These are among the classes specially mentioned by witnesses as smoking hemp drugs. Among the upper classes this habit is generally regarded as exceptional and indicating a special tendency to dissipation, but not so among these lower classes. Bhang is also used to some extent by these classes, but is more generally used by the more respectable middle and upper classes. Among those who are specially mentioned as habitually using it are Marwaris, Banias, and jewellers, sharp, intelligent, and successful trades- men. Bhang is also occasionally used more or less generally by practically all classes on certain feast days and at times of social rejoicing. Like all intoxicants everywhere, the drugs are used in moderation, but more frequently to excess, by licentious and dissipated persons of all classes. Except, however, in the case of religious mendicants, the use by all the classes named above is generally moderate. Excess is exceptional. Popular opinion regarding this use. 489. From what has been said above it will be expected that there would be many witnesses whose opinion regarding the use of these drugs as stimulants would not be favourable. The very great majority of witnesses in all provinces declare that this use of the drugs is regarded with disapproval by the people generally. This disapproval rests on several grounds. It depends partly on the classes using the drugs. Many witnesses point out that ganja is the cheapest intoxicant, and that it is principally used by the lower classes, while bhang is more used by the upper classes. They state that it is on this account that ganja smoking is regarded with much more general disfavour than bhang drinking. As one witness points out, the feeling is somewhat akin to that which some Englishmen who do not gen- erally disapprove of stimulants have regarding a "vulgar taste for gin." On the other hand, the use of ganja by religious persons is not thus generally disapproved.

CH. X.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 195 Many witnesses share the view which one witness tersely expresses thus: "Sanyasis are respected by the people; low caste people are not respected." There is no doubt that by far the greater part of the community abstain from any disapproval, and in fact are even strongly in favour, of the use of these drugs by religious persons, although that use is so often excessive. Mr. Monro (Bengal witness No. 206), however, records an instance of his having persuaded the people among whom he was working to dissociate ganja and holiness, so that "a sanyasi was laughed out of the town when I convicted him of habi- tually consuming ganja." The disapproval of the use of hemp drugs by classes other than these reli- gious classes is, as has been already indicated, based also on a religious objection to intoxicants still held by many, both Hindus and Muhammadans. There can be no doubt that this orthodox objection influences the public expression of opinion by many who have ceased themselves to share this religious sentiment. It is a respectable thing to denounce intoxicants; and it sometimes requires an effort for a witness to speak favourably or apologetically of intoxicants, especially of those which are used by the lower orders. Another ground for this expression of dis- approval by so large a majority of the witnesses is the fact that so many of them have seen nothing but the excessive use. It cannot be too carefully remembered that the moderate use does not obtrude itself, and that much of the evidence given before the Commission deals in truth only with excess. Thus we find a large num- ber of witnesses illustrating the popular disapproval of the drug by pointing out that "ganjeri" or "bhangi" (the names given to the consumers of ganja or bhang) is a term of great reproach. They point out that it means "one who acts as if he had lost all sense," an unreliable and despicable character. Other witnesses explain that these terms correspond to the English word "drunkard," and that the moderate use is not, so far as their experience goes, regarded with contempt at all. Akin to this is the natural desire expressed by several witnesses to assist the young in resisting the temptations of bad companions by establishing in their minds a wholesome antipathy to intoxicants of all kinds, excessive indulgence in which is followed by disastrous results, especially to the young. Hemp drugs and alcohol. 490. In this connection it is well to notice the references made to alcohol. It is only a minority of the witnesses who compare alcohol and hemp drugs. But it is a striking fact that of these witnesses a majority of about three to one declare alcohol to be more injurious than hemp drugs. In every province the majority of the witnesses who make this comparison hold the view above expressed. This majority includes experienced officers of Government. Thus Colonel Hutchinson, Commissioner of Lahore (Punjab witness No. 4), says: "So far as effects have come to my notice, the effects of liquor are infinitely worse than those of drugs." Mr. J. B. Thom- son, Collector of Allahabad (North-Western Provinces witness No. 2), gave evidence to the following effect: "I remember no case from which I can deduce the theory that the use of the drugs is in any way connected with crime; that is to say, from my own personal experience. I cannot say the same regarding alcohol even among natives of this country." Similarly, Mr. Toynbee, Commissioner of Bhagalpur (Bengal witness No. 4), says: "I have never had persons pointed out to me as social wrecks from the effects of ganja. As far as I have seen, many more cases of evil effects from alcohol than from hemp have come before me."
196 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. X. And Colonel Bowie, Commissioner in the Central Provinces (witness No. 2), says: "I can call to mind a great many cases which I have had to deal with as a Magistrate and as a Sessions Judge, in which serious hurt and homicide have been caused by persons under the influence of alcohol, but not a single case of crime of any kind which had been committed under the influence of bhang or ganja." Representative officers from other provinces might be quoted, such as Mr. Vidal or Mr. Campbell, C.I.E., in Bombay, or Mr. H. E. M. James, Commis- sioner in Sind. The Rev. Mr. Laflamme (Madras witness No. 153), who took much pains in collecting information, gives evidence in the same sense. It is, however, in the northern provinces that there is most experience of these drugs. The only officer of standing in Upper India who holds the contrary view is Mr. T. Stoker, Excise Commissioner, North-Western Provinces (witness No. 6), who says: "I put these drugs above liquor and opium in their injurious tendencies." In saying this, he differs, however, both from his predecessor, Mr. R. Wall (witness No. 233), who held the office for eleven years, and from the Hon'ble A. Cadell (witness No. 1), who is the Member of the Board of Revenue in charge of Excise. The opinion that alcohol is more injurious than hemp drugs is also expressed by leading Native gentlemen in these provinces, such as Maharaja Bahadur Sir Jotindra Mohan Tagore, K.C.S.I. (Bengal witness No. 163), Munshi Newal Kishore (North-Western Provinces witness No. 231), Babu P. C. Chatterji, Judge, Chief Court (Punjab witness No. 76), and the Hon'ble Gangadhar Madho Chitnavis (Central Provinces witness No. 46). The first of these only need be quoted. He says: "The use of the aforesaid indigenous drugs appears to me to be preferable to the use of ardent spirits and wines now rapidly re- placing them to the great injury of the moral and material well-being of our people. Prohibition, I fear, would lead many to take to the use of ardent liquors, and this, in my humble opinion, would be replacing one evil by another of still greater magnitude." These views are held by the great majority of the native witnesses who make the comparison between hemp drugs and alcohol; and there is really no witness of authority on the other side. This is also the opinion of medical witnesses who make this comparison. It is no doubt an accepted and established opinion among medical men that the evil effects of alcohol are intensified in the tropics. This may explain the very strong opinion held regarding alcohol. Perhaps it is unnecessary to refer to more of these witnesses than to two of more than ordinary experience who take a very strong view of the deleterious character of hemp drugs if used to excess, but a still stronger view regarding alcohol. Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Crombie says: "I believe that the habit of using ganja moderately is absolutely harm- less; but I think even the moderate use of alcohol is liable to produce tissue changes in the long run. Further, I here refer entirely to the native community; and it is my observation that when a native takes to alcohol, it is extremely dif- ficult for him to remain moderate; and in life assurance work, of which I have a good deal, I always advise an extra premium in the case of any native who indulges in alcohol even in the most moderate way, and utterly refuse to accept a native life if there is evidence of the consumption of alcohol to any considerable extent which would still be considered moderate in the case of Europeans. My experi- ence leads me to hold the same views of the effects of alcohol on the lower classes.
CH. X.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 197 A native who takes to liquor is lost. As regards the excessive use, I would still place alcohol first. I regard it as most deleterious." The only other medical man who need be quoted is Dr. H. M, Clark, a well-known Medical Missionary in the Punjab (witness No. 46), who says: "As regards charas, I think there can be no such thing as moderate use, if we mean such use as will not leave any permanent bad effect on the system. In whatever quantity it is used, it is bound to be deleterious. I should say that in this country alcohol does more harm than charas." These views are supported by distinguished native medical men like Rai Bahadur Kanny Lall Dey, C.I.E. (Bengal witness No. 117), and others. It is not within the province of the Commission to come to any definite find- ing on this evidence as to the comparative effects of alcohol and hemp drugs. The effects of alcohol were not within the scope of the inquiry. As has already been stated, it is only a minority of the witnesses who make the com- parison. It was not asked for in the Commission's questions, and has only been incidentally made by certain witnesses. The Commission have not felt called on to test the correctness of the views of the witnesses on this point, as this could only have been done by a full inquiry into the effects of liquor. But it is important to observe the existence of these views. In this con- nection it is interesting to notice the existence in certain parts of the country of a belief among ignorant persons that "the attack on hemp drugs was due to a desire to foster European liquor" (see the evidence of Mr. William Almon, Assistant Collector, Abkari Department in the town of Bombay, witness No. 38); or, as another witness puts it, "the agitation is attributed to them who are anxious to encourage the spread of alcohol, i.e., the persons who import and manufacture liquor" (V. K. Joglekar, Bombay witness No. 110). The existence of such misapprehensions can only be explained by the difficulty felt in accounting for an agitation against these drugs alone. The Rev. Mr. Laflamme (Madras witness No. 153) says: "Many are surprised to hear that the Government is concerned about a practice which is confined to so small a portion of the people as is ganja and bhang, and is not concerned about the widespread, rapidly increasing, and much more injurious habit of alcoholic drink, from which much greater harm results. I have been six years in the country, and engaged in village work during four years. Before entering on these in- quiries I did not know the hemp drugs were in use among the people, and had only met with them in the temples." One witness of much experience (Khan Bahadur Kadir Dad Khan, C.I.E., Sind witness No. 4) says: "All classes of the people, from the most influential spiritual leader to the lowest beggar, will say that the British Government, while not interfering or prohibiting the use of alcohol in their own country, are stopping them here from the use of less intoxicat- ing drugs, which they have been using from time immemorial, and which is also religiously respected." Injurious effects of hemp drugs (history). 491. Among the ancient physicians the evil effects of the drug are thus referred to by the author of the Makhzan-el-Adwiya: "Afterwards the sedative effects begin to preside, the spirits sink, the vision darkens and weakens, and madness, melancholy, fearful- ness, dropsy, and such like distempers are the sequel, while the seminal secretions dry up." Alluding to its popular use, the author dwells on the eventual 50
198 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. X. evil consequences of the indulgence: "Weakness of the digestive organs first ensues, followed by flatulency, indigestion, swellings of the limbs and face, change of complexion, diminution of sexual vigour, loss of teeth, heaviness, cowardice, depraved and wicked ideas, etc." Iban Beitar was the first to record its tendeney to produce mental derangement, and he even states that it occasionally proves fatal. Taki-ed-din-Ahmad, commonly known as Makrizi, who wrote a number of treatises upon Egypt in the 14th century, states that in 780 Hijra very severe ordinances were passed in Egypt against the use of the drug; the famous garden in the valley of Dijoncina was rooted up, and all those con- victed of the use of the drugs were subjected to the extraction of their teeth; but in 799 Hijra the custom re-established itself with more than original vigour. Makrizi states: "As its consequence, general corruption of senti- ments and manners ensued, modesty disappeared, every base and evil passion was openly indulged in, and nobility of external form alone remained to these infatuated beings." Rumphius alludes doubtingly to the alleged aphro- disiac powers of the drug, and states that the kind of mental excitement it pro- duces depends upon the temperament of the consumer. O'Shaughnessy in his introduction to certain experiments with hemp drugs remarks: "As to the evil sequel so unanimously dwelt on by all writers, these did not appear to us so numerous, so immediate, or so formidable as many which may be clearly traced to over-indulgence in other powerful stimulants or narcotics, viz., alcohol, opium, or tobacco." O'Shaughnessy also refers to insanity occasioned by con- tinued hemp inebriation as follows: "Before quitting this subject, it is desirable to notice the singular form of insanity which the incautious use of hemp preparations often occasions, especially among young men who try it for the first time. Several such cases have presented themselves to our notice. They are as peculiar as the 'delirium tremens' which succeeds the prolonged abuse of spirituous liquors, but are quite distinct from any other species of madness with which we are acquainted. The state is at once recognized by the strange balancing gait of the patient, a constant rubbing of the hands, perpetual giggling, and a propensity to caress and chafe the feet of all bystanders of whatever rank. The eyes wear an expression of cunning and merriment which can scarcely be mistaken. In a few cases the patients are violent; in many highly aphrodisiac; in all that we have seen voraciously hungry. There is no increased heat or frequency of circulation or any appearance of inflammation or conges- tion, and the skin and general functions are in a natural state. A blister to the nape of the neck, leeches to the temples, and nauseating doses of tartar emetic with saline purgatives have rapidly dispelled the symptoms in all the cases we have met with, and have restored the patients to perfect health." This description of what O'Shaughnessy considered hemp drug insanity is of considerable interest. It is clear from his account that the symptoms were of short duration, almost typical, and that under treatment recovery was rapid. Such cases as those described by O'Shaughnessy are probably similar to the class of cases which have occasionally come before the Com- mission as having occurred while under observation of the certifying medical officer, and which on reaching the asylum were sane. They were probably more of the character of intoxication than of insanity. The curious point, how- ever, in connection with O'Shaughnessy's account of hemp drug insanity is the absence of all information as to cases of longer duration, such as the class of
CH. X.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 199 cases now met with in asylums and attributed to hemp drugs. And this omission is all the more striking because O'Shaughnessy had devoted special attention to the subject of hemp drugs, and indeed was the first to draw the attention of European practitioners to the value of the drug as a remedial agent; and it is hardly possible that if in his day any large number of persons insane from the alleged use of the drug had been admitted into asylums, he would have been ignorant of the fact and omitted to notice it in his account of the effects of the drug. Effects in other countries. 492. The action taken in Turkey, Egypt, Greece, and Trinidad in the direction of the prohibition of the use of hemp drugs will be noticed later (vide Chapter XIV.) The Commis- sion have not before them material to enable them to judge of the statements regarding the effects of the drugs in these countries which formed the basis of the action taken. The note drawn up in 1890 by the Sanitary Board of Greece, on which the action in that country was based, contains a statement of the effects of the drugs as alleged to have been ascertained (a) by scientific inquiry in India and other "warm countries" by experts, among whom O'Shaughnessy is specially mentioned, and (b) from statistics of the Indian (and especially the Bengal) lunatic asylums. But there is nothing given in original of the views of any of the experts named. The views of O'Shaughnessy and the Indian asylum statistics are already before the Commission. They have therefore no new material in this note. They are compelled therefore to set it aside. For the same reason they find themselves unable to arrive at any opinion in regard to the recent controversy between Dr. Ireland and "Pyramid" in the British Medical Journal regarding the effects of the drugs in Trinidad and Egypt. They pass on, therefore, to the evidence available in this country. Failure of witnesses to distinguish excessive from moderate use. 493. In order to ascertain the alleged noxious physical, mental, or moral effects which are popularly believed to be induced by use of hemp drugs, the Commission considered it de- sirable in framing the questions on these points to clearly discriminate between the moderate and excessive use. The replies show, however, that in very many instances the witnesses have failed thus to differen- tiate between the two uses of the drug. This may be partly due to the some- what inherent difficulty in discriminating or to carelessness on the part of per- sons who conducted the inquiries. The evidence, moreover, before the Commis- sion clearly demonstrates that any departures from the normal in health, if associ- ated with the mere mention of the hemp drug habit, is in most cases sufficient for "cause" and "effect". Medical witnesses. 494. In analyzing the replies given to question No. 45, which deals with the alleged noxious effects of the moderate use of the drugs, the Commission have thought it expedient to indicate first the view taken by the medical witnesses, and then to consider the tenor of the evidence given by all witnesses, including medical. In considering the medical evidence, the witnesses have been divided into three classes200 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. X. attached to the evidence tendered by each of these classes, the Commission con- sider it necessary to point out that the superior medical officers are by their training necessarily in a far better position to judge intelligently of the effects of the drugs than the other two classes; but the superior medical officer class com- prises both European doctors and assistant surgeons. The former classCH. X.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 201 effects of the excessive use is much stronger. The number of witnesses who are able to give information is indeed much smaller than might have been expected, and certainly indicates that the evil of excessive consumption is not widespread. But of those who do speak of the effects of excessive consumption, the very large majority state that they are evil. There are very few exceptional witnesses who allege that the excessive use does no harm. This is precisely what might have been expected. The excessive use of any intoxicant cannot be other than evil, and in the great majority of cases of excess the evil must be manifest. The general character of the evidence. 496. The impressions which the evidence leaves on the mind are these. The evil results from the use of the drugs, whether moderate or excessive, have not hitherto obtruded themselves on observation. The only manner in which they have really attract- ed attention is in respect to asylum statistics. Apart from this, the majority of witnesses have not seen the effects at all, and know nothing about them. Of the minority, a few witnesses only have had their attention drawn to the effects be- fore this inquiry began; the rest knew nothing of them until they began to search them out on receipt of the questions issued by the Commission. Some of these witnesses fail to remember that in going to public places, such as shops or shrines where smokers congregate, to ascertain the effects, they have taken measures to see not the moderate, but the excessive, use of the drugs. They thus fail to discriminate between the moderate and excessive use. Their evidence is as unfair a representation of the general effects of the drug as would be the evidence of men regarding the general effects of alcohol who judged of these effects solely from what they saw in public houses in England. Further, a great deal of the evidence is based upon a casual observation of very few cases of actual consumers. The number of cases seen by a witness is as a rule too few to form an adequate basis for definite opinion in respect to results. Yet there are but few witnesses who have seen and admitted this necessity for caution in the expression of opinion. Again, these cases are not only few in number, but as a rule very inadequately observed. There are very few of them indeed which have been known to the witnesses in any way intimately or for any length of time. Occasionally a case is mentioned of a relative or personal acquaintance who has been seriously injured by excess. But as a rule the cases mentioned have been cases of wandering mendicants, devotees at temples or strangers in the street, cases observed in a shop visited for the purpose, or in a collection of social wrecks brought together for the witnesses' inspection, or (in the case of medical witnesses) outdoor patients who have come casually for relief, and whose history is unknown. Clearly these are not cases on which satisfactory conclusions can be based. It must be impossible to say with anything like certainty what features from among the physical, mental, and moral features of the case are due to circumstances and causes antecedent to or independent of the hemp drug habit, and what (if any) may be reasonably ascribed, and in what degree, to that habit. The necessity for testing it. 497. The result of this has been to make much of the evidence vague and unsatisfactory. It has been deemed necessary, there fore, to make an effort to sift and test the evidence. It can hardly be considered necessary to question the view that excessive con- 51
202 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. X. sumption of these drugs indicates and intensifies mental and moral weakness, and must also be attended in all but exceptional constitutions with some visible physical injury. In regard to the moderate use, on the other hand, it would be quite wrong to accept without clear evidence the view that physical, mental, and moral injury resulted. In the absence of all physiological evidence of tissue changes being produced by these drugs, as they are produced by alcohol, it must be presumed, until the contrary appear, that the moderate use does not cause injury in any but the most exceptional cases. General experience warrants the admission that even the moderate use of such drugs may cause injury in excep- tional cases owing to idiosyncracy or peculiar diathesis. But as a rule, practi- cally without exception, the presumption must be against injury from the moder- ate use. It is necessary then to weigh the evidence carefully so as to ascertain both whether there is any ground for believing that the moderate use is attended by evil results at all, and also what the particular results are which under any circumstances follow the use of the drugs. Limitation of the issues raised. 498. Leaving out of account for the present the question of the connection of the drugs with insanity, there is no evidence of any weight regarding mental and moral injury from the moderate use of the drugs. Vague statements are made by a small minority of the witnesses regarding the stupidity or moral weakness of consumers whom they have met. But after making allowance for the fact that these observations have often been of excessive consumers, and for the lower mental and moral tone found generally among the lower orders to which the consumers, or at all events the smokers of hemp drugs, almost exclusively belong, there is little left in the evidence on which to base any opinion. The statements, too, are of results of an indefinite character and difficult to gauge or account for even with careful observa- tion of the whole history of a case which is never possible in the instances adduced. Similarly, in regard to physical injury, there are a considerable number of vague statements made regarding "impairment of constitution," debility, emaciation, and other physical results of an indefinite character. These are largely accounted for by the mere fact that it is the poorer classes who ordinarily use these drugs. The poor cultivator or day labourer, who works hard and has nothing but a bare sufficiency of the necessaries of life, cannot be expected to be sleek. Witnesses who have spoken of the use of hemp as making men thin and ill- nourished looking have admitted that their experience is based only on what they have seen of the poor, and that among the poor there is no specially marked appearance of this kind among the consumers of hemp. A similar fallacy is noticed by several witnesses. They point out that the drugs, which are more used in malarious and unhealthy tracts than elsewhere, are credited with the evil effects which result from the malarious and unhealthy conditions. As a matter of fact, the moderate consumer in such localities cannot, they say, be distinguished from the non-consumer. Then, again, a great deal of the vague evidence regarding the general injury to the constitution alleged to result from the use of hemp drugs is based on what the witnesses know of fakirs and wander- ing mendicants who consume the drugs. It is surprising to find witnesses who have had years of experience, whose work has brought them into close contact with the ordinary life of the people, testifying that they have never seen the drugs used except by religious mendicants, or known any of the effects of the
CH. X.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 203 drugs except as shown in these classes. The mendicant, if he is ascetic, is naturally of a very spare and even emaciated appearance. The use by such mendicants is better known to the community generally than the use by any other class. The mendicant pushes himself to the front wherever he goes, and he has no hesitation in asking for precisely the thing he wants at the time. His use of hemp is therefore known to all who meet him. The life he leads204 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. X the conditions observed were due to such general causes as poverty or malaria, or to such special causes as vicious or dissolute habits or even disease, quite apart from hemp drugs, has been too often forgotten. And the evidence is vague and unreliable. On the whole, then, it seems best to devote attention to clear and definite issues, and to discuss under physical effects the alleged causation of specific diseases like dysentery, bronchitis, and asthma which are frequently mentioned; under mental effects, the alleged causation of insanity; and under moral effects, the alleged connection between hemp drugs and crime.

Assistant Surgeon Devendranath Roy (witness No. 123), of over 20 years' service, and who has had service in Rajputana, the North-Western Provinces, Behar, and Ben- gal, where hemp drugs are used by a large portion of the people, is of opinion that those who smoke ganja not more than twice or thrice a day do not suffer in general health; bhang does not impair the digestion, whereas ganja does. "Those of my patients," he remarks, "who admitted having been habitual ganja smokers suffered from dysentery or diarrhCH.

In his second paper the witness states: "Ganja smokers gen- erally die of bloody dysentery, asthma and phthisis, and hmoptysis." And in his last paper he says: "It produces bloody dysentery and chest diseases, blood- spitting, bronchitis, asthma, and phthisis." Kailas Chundra Bose, L.M.S. (witness No. 135), is a private medical practitioner in Calcutta with an extensive practice. He states that no ill effects are produced by the moderate use, and that, instead of causing bronchitis, dysentery, or asthma, it relieves these affections. The witness, however, states in his oral examination: "My experience is not to any large extent what I hav e gathered in my practice, but rather what I have learnt from smokers." Assistant Surgeon Akbar Khan (witness No. 124) is another Teacher in the Patna Medical School. He states the habitual moderate use of any of the drugs does not produce noxious effects, but that charas and ganja cause dysentery, bronchitis, and asthma if the consumers are not well fed. Witnesses Nos. 126 and 138 consider that no ill effects are produced. Assistant Surgeon Upendra Nath Sen (witness No. 118) states that bronchitis and asthma are common complaints of ganja smok- ers. Madhab Krishna Dass, L.M.S. (witness No. 158), a private practitioner in Calcutta, considers that smoking may cause dysentery, bronchitis, or asthma. As- sistant Surgeon Durga Nath Chakravarti (witness No. 150) considers that "ganja causes dysentery after a long run." Annoda Prasanna Ghatak, m.b. (witness No. 148), a private medical practitioner, considers that digestive complaints are caused when good food is not procurable. Rakhal Das Ghosh, L.M.S. (witness No. 149), a private practitioner in Calcutta, had apparently seen no ill effects caused by the drug. The remaining witnesses in this class clearly failed to discriminate between the moderate and excessive use, and their evidence has not been considered. Three hospital assistants were examined. One gave no reply regarding moderate use. The other stated: "The habitual moderate use of ganja or charas does not produce any noxious effects-physical, mental, or moral; but the use of ganja impairs the constitution in some way or other............and has a tendency towards bronchitis and asthma." Witness No. 145 is a vernacular class hospital assistant, but not now in Government employ. According to this witness, moderate use of ganja leads to excessive use. "The habitual moderate consumers, as well as the excessive consumers, suffer in their lungs and become insane.........No intoxicant can be taken in moderation except when administered medicinally." Fifteen native practitioners were examined. Bijoya Ratna Sen (witness No. 151), a kabiraj practising in Calcutta, considers that the habitual moderate use of ganja or charas, but not siddhi, may in some cases cause bronchitis, dysentery, or asthma. Witness No. 152, also of Calcutta, gives the same reply couched in the same language. Witness No. 126, of Nattore, in the Rajshahi district, and witness No. 153, of Calcutta, both consider the moderate use harmless. Piyari Mohan (witness No. 154), a kabiraj, states: "I know it causes dysentery, and I be- lieve owing to its heating power it can cause bronchitis and asthma." Kedares- war Acharjya (witness No. 137) remarks: "Those ganja smokers who cannot com- mand abundant wholesome food suffer from dysentery, but it is difficult to deter- mine how far it is due to ganja or to improper food. As to asthma, I have not seen any typical case originating from ganja smoking. I know that a chronic catarrhal condition of the air passages with a certain amount of spasm is the misfortune of
208 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XI. many old ganja smokers. I know a friend who suffered from chronic bronchitis, and in whom asthmatic fits were induced by attempts to smoke ganja." The witness refers also to another case in which a habitual ganja smoker had an asth- matic attack "which subsided on breaking off the habit and reappeared on resuming it." This witness lays stress on personal idiosyncrasy as modifying the effects of the drugs, and on the importance of a diet rich in fat. Witness No. 155, another kabiraj, states that, while no ill effects are produced, occasionally it causes dysentery, bronchitis, and asthma. Witness No. 128, also a kabiraj, states that, according to the Aurveda Shastra, smoking these drugs causes bronchi- tis and asthma, and in his opinion "even the moderate use of any of these drugs, not according to the rules of Shastra, is injurious in its effects." This witness does not appear to have any personal knowledge of ill effects, but to base his views on the teachings of the Shastras. Witness No. 139 states: "Certainly they produce noxious effects on the moral and physical constitution;" but as the witness is silent as to the effects of excessive use, probably he has not discriminated between the two uses of the drugs. Witness No. 157, a vaid, considers that even the habitual moderate use of these drugs produces noxious effects. This is the pandit who was consulted by Dr. Flood Murray (witness No. 102), and who pro- duced two cases of hemp drug asthma and weakened heart for Dr. Murray's inspection. These seem to have been the only cases in any way connected with hemp drugs that he had. Witness No. 146 is a zamindar and medical practi- tioner, and does not reply as to effects. Witness No. 147 studied two and a half years at the Calcutta Medical College, but took no degree. He states that no noxious effects are produced without giving details. Assam. 501. Three commissioned and three uncovenanted medical officers were examined in Assam. Surgeon-Major Macnamara (witness No. 20) has been for thirteen years among people who make use of hemp products to a greater or less degree. He is Civil Surgeon of Tezpur, and has had opportunities of observing the effects of the drug on tea garden coolies. Regarding the effects caused by the moderate use of the drugs, the witness remarked: "I can't define moderation no more than I can in the case of alcohol. The limit is reached when any ill effects are apparent when the limit is crossed. The constitution is impaired and digestion is injured. Dysentery, bronchitis, and asthma find an easier victim." On cross-examination, the wit- ness stated: "In regard to the effects of the drugs, I mean what I have seen in people taking the drugs just as I know the effects of alcohol. I have never seen a man actually taking ganja, although I have tried to get people to do so." Surgeon- Major H. C. Banerji has had 14 years' service, out of which five years have been passed as a Civil Surgeon in Assam. This officer considers that bronchitis, asthma, and dysentery are not produced by the moderate use of the drugs. Dr. Macleod (witness No. 23) stated that bronchitis, asthma, and dysentery are caused, but fails to answer the question regarding results of excessive use; and there is every probability that he failed to discriminate between the moderate and excessive use. Surgeon-Major Mullane (witness No. 19), out of nearly 17 years' service, has spent 13 years in the plains districts of the Assam Valley. Regarding effects, he remarked: "Among natives there is a widespread belief that the mortality among ganja consumers from bowel complaints is heavy." He fails to answer the question regarding results of excessive use; and from the nature of his reply quoted it is fair to assume that he has no personal knowledge regarding
CH. XI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 209 effects of either the moderate or excessive use of the drugs. Dr. Partridge (witness No. 22) is an officer of 26 years' service, and stated that he has never seen the evil effects of the drug except in cases under observation for insanity; "the effects apart from that have never attracted my attention." Three assistant surgeons were examined. Witness No. 25 states: "Moderate use has not, I believe, much to do with bronchitis, dysentery, or asthma." Witness No. 26 considers that "ganja smoking causes asthma and bronchitis," but he does not appear to discriminate between the moderate and excessive use. Wit- ness No. 30 states that the drug "does not cause dysentery, bronchitis, or asthma; rather moderate ganja smoking allays hard breathing in asthma." Two hospital assistants were examined. Witness No. 27, after stating in his paper that in long standing cases the use of the drug is certain to cause bron- chitis, asthma, and dysentery, admitted in his cross-examination: "It is no use my making any statement, because I have no experience of the effects of ganja, and in fact know nothing about it." Witness No. 28 considers that the drug causes bronchitis, asthma, and dysentery; but he fails to answer the question re- garding results of excessive use, and it is fair to assume that he has not discrimina- ted between the moderate and excessive use. Only one native practitioner was examined (witness No. 31), who considered that bronchitis, asthma, and dysentery were caused by the moderate use; but from his written statement it is obvious that he failed to discriminate between the moderate and excessive use. North-Western Provinces. 502. In the North-Western Provinces nineteen commissioned and two uncov- enanted medical officers were examined. Surgeon- Major Tuohy (witness No. 87), of thirteen years' service, stated: "I am unable to answer these questions from personal observation. The consumers of the drugs have assured me that they cause no illeffect s of any kind when taken in moderation. One man only said that bronchitis and asthma were caused." Witnesses No. 75 and 89 stated that no ill effects are induced by the moderate use. Dr. Harding (witness No. 92) in his paper ascribed bronchitis and asthma to the moderate use, but on cross-examination admitted that "the moderate use of these drugs does not in my opinion cause any injury or lead to any baneful results." Surgeon-Captain Roberts (witness No. 91) premises his written statement by remarking that "until this enquiry I knew absolutely nothing about the hemp plant, its use or abuse, save a few grains of information acquired by any student of materia medica in a medical school." Dr. Roberts has had 51/2 years' service in India; for one year he toured through towns and villages of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, and for nearly two years he has acted as a Civil Surgeon, and for the remainder of his service he was in charge of native regiments. Dr. Roberts remarked: "So far as the foregoing opportunities served to impress my powers of observation, absolutely no question of the use, and still less of the abuse, of hemp drugs by the people of India has arisen in my mind prior to this inquiry..................Those who most strongly aver the ill effects of hemp deal (when questioned for definite facts) in general- ities, suggesting a dyscrasia, loss of functional power, impotence, chronic rheumatism, pallor, and atrophy, and all these results are precisely what I am led to expect from malarial and splenic cachexia." Surgeon-Major F. C. Chatterji (witness No. 85) has had a lifelong experience of India from Peshawar to Burma. 53
210 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XI. He stated that no ill effects from the moderate use are known to him. Surgeon- Lieutenant-Colonel B. O'Brien (witness No. 80), of over 20 years' service, stated that no impairment of the constitution is produced; "it gives great relief in dysen- tery." He added: "In both the Agra and Benares Lunatic Asylums it is thought by the officials that asthma is more prevalent amongst the insane who indulge in ganja. I could find no evidence to substantiate this idea. During my 20 years' attendance at dispensaries in these provinces, I have never met a patient who alleged that he was suffering from the effects of the use, moderate or otherwise, of hemp drugs." Surgeon-Major Cadge (witness No. 81), of over 15 years' service, stated that the habitual moderate use of bhang does not act injuriously in any way any more than the habitual moderate use of alcohol. Surgeon-Major W. Deane (witness No. 88), of 13 years' service, ten of which have been spent in the North-Western Provinces and one in Burma, has no personal observations regard- ing ill effects to offer. The greater part of his information has been derived from an assistant surgeon. Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel A.J. Wilcocks (witness No. 76), of over 20 years' service, has no personal knowledge of ill effects ensuing from moderate use. "On the contrary, it is an excellent drug in the treatment of dysen- tery." Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Moriarty (witness No. 79), of over 20 years' service, stated on cross-examination: "I have been led to understand that it was a peculiarity of charas smoking to tend to cause asthma............ I have never personally seen any case of asthma or bronchitis which I could attribute to charas." Witness No. 93 made no attempt to discriminate between the moderate and excessive use of the drugs. Brigade-Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel W. R. Hooper (witness No. 74), of 33 years' service, of which 30 years have been spent in civil employ, remarked that no ill effects are induced in a healthy subject by the moderate use of the drugs; but, on the contrary, he considers that in some cases of asthma and chronic bronchitis smoking ganja or charas may be beneficial. Cross-examined as to the basis of his remarks, Dr. Hooper stated: "My remarks about the absence of ill results from the moderate use of the drugs on a healthy subject are based on enquiry made from natives both recently and formerly. I have not seen asthma or bronchitis due to smoking ganja. I have no experience of such smoking as a remedy for these diseases." Surgeon-Captain Morwood (witness No. 90), of 61/2 years' service, who has had no opportunity of obtaining information about hemp drugs, stated that ill effects are probably not induced if good food be procurable. "May perhaps cause cough." Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel G. Hall (wintess No. 78), of over 20 years' service and large jail experience, considers that no ill effects are caused by moderate use. Surgeon-Captain Weir (witness No. 84) stated that charas and ganja weaken the constitution; bhang does not seem to do so: ganja and charas both cause difficulty in breath- ing; bhang does not. The witness does not touch upon the effects of excessive use, and may be presumed to have made no distinction between moderation and excess. Surgeon-Captain C. Mactaggart (witness No. 83) stated that in moderate doses it does not appear to have any effect in producing diseases; the witness bases his opinion on what he had learned from prisoners who had been consumers of hemp drugs before coming into jail under his charge. Surgeon-Major E. Mair (witness No. 82) has been in the Jail Department for a number of years, but has had no special opportunities for obtaining information. He stated: "It is a common opinion that smoking ganja or charas is a frequent cause of bronchitis and asthma." The witness does not deal with the results of the excessive use of
CH. XI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 211 the drugs, and may be presumed not to have discriminated. Surgeon-Lieutenant- Colonel Holmes (witness No. 77) is also a Superintendent of a central jail. He stated: "Those who habitually smoke ganja or charas suffer from chest affections; .............said also to cause dysentery, bronchitis, and asthma." The witness does not distinguish between moderate and excessive use; and the basis of his informa- tion is "from seeing effects on prisoners and others, and from enquiries made of the various officials and medical subordinates." Surgeon-Major G. Emerson (wit- ness No. 86) has had sixteen years' service, seven of which have been in civil employ. He remarked: "I have never seen dysentery caused by it, but there is no doubt that bronchitis and asthma are to a great extent due to the use of charas and ganja." On cross-examination, the witness said: "My opinion in regard to moderate use of ganja and charas is that evil effects might be pro- duced in certain cases even by moderate use, but as a rule not............I should not be prepared to attribute to the moderate use of these drugs any further evil effects than to the moderate use of tobacco. I should like to transfer my remarks now to answer No. 46, which deals with the excessive use." Twenty-four assistant surgeons were examined. Witness No. 109 stated: "I have had to treat a few cases of chronic bronchitis and asthma in which charas smoking was the alleged cause. Charas smokers cough very much." On cross-examination the witness said: "I may say that I did not make enquiry as to whether the bronchitis or asthma was really due to charas, and as a fact people suffering from these complaints often take to charas for relief." Witness No. 105 stated: "Smoking causes bronchitis and asthma, but drinking (bhang) does not, and is beneficial in dysentery." On oral examination the witness stated: "The smoking of ganja and charas caused asthma and bronchitis within my own observa- tion. I have found these diseases very prevalent among those who smoke the drugs to excess. The moderate use will bring about the same results in time, but I have no personal experience of this. It is not a fact that ganja smoking is a domestic remedy against asthma and bronchitis, but dhatura is so used." The witness then referred to two cases of asthma which he attributes to the drug. "Both these cases began with the moderate use, which developed into the excessive before the effects I have described came on. I have no experience of the moderate use causing such serious results, but I think it probable it could if long continu- ed." Witness No. 96 does not mention any diseases as resulting from the moder- ate use. S. P. Roy (witness No. 120) is an M.B. of the Calcutta Uni- versity and not in Government employ; he is Municipal Analyst, Allahabad. His evidence is to the following effect: "Cases of chronic bronchitis and bronchial asthma and dysentery are too numerous to be cited. It is a popular notion, and I believe well founded in Bengal, that the habitual ganja smokers suffer from bronchitis and die ultimately from bloody stools." On cross-examination the witness stated: "I have never seen any ganja smokers of long standing who do not suffer from bronchitis and bronchial asthma, and in making this statement I do not confine it to my professional observation. I have not noticed that dysentery is so commonly connected with the hemp drugs. I have heard of ganja being smoked for the relief of asthma, and I have tried the extract of Can- nabis indica for it without good results." Assistant Surgeon Subhan Ali (witness No. 98) is an M.R.C.S. and L.R.C.P. of London, and stated that ganja and charas cause bronchitis and asthma. Witness No. 103 states: "Ganja and charas very often produce asthma and bronchitis and sometimes dysentery, but one
212 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XI. chillum a day would not do so." Assistant Surgeon Hari Lal (witness No. 104) differentiates between the moderate use of bhang and ganja and charas. Bhang the witness considers does not cause dysentery, bronchitis, or asthma; ganja and charas impair the constitution slowly and cause bronchitis and asthma. Isan Chandar Roy, M.B. (witness No. 127), is a private practitioner. He stated: "In some per- sons moderate use does not produce noxious effects. But in certain persons, espe- cially those who are predisposed or whose particular organs are already weakened, may have their digestive organs impaired, dysentery, bronchitis, or asthma being produced." Witness No. 107 considers that, provided good food be obtainable, the moderate use does not cause asthma or bronchitis. Witness No. 101 stated that dysentery is not caused, but bronchitis and asthma may result from habitual use of ganja and charas. Witness No. 99 stated that all these diseases are produced. Witness No. 100, on the other hand, made a diametrically opposite statement, viz., that none of these diseases are produced. Manohar Pershad Tewari (wit- ness No. 130) was formerly in Government service, but is now a private practitioner for the last eight years. He considers that the use of any of these drugs, except bhang, does cause dysentery, bronchitis, and asthma. On oral examination, the witness stated: "I have had four or five, or at most ten, patients a year who came before me in my private practice who were in the habit of using intoxicants. Of these, the most, up to eight, are consumers of hemp drugs. The other consumers of hemp drugs referred to were suffering from diarrhCH. XI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 213 nourishing food seldom suffer from any ill effects. Witness No. III stated that the habitual use of ganja or charas does not cause bronchitis, asthma, or dysentery, but cures these diseases. Witness No. 106 gave no information of effects induced by the excessive use; with regard to the moderate use, he stated the effects are "not much marked," and that bronchitis and asthma might be caused after long use. Nobin Chandra Mitter (witness No. 148) is a retired assistant surgeon. He stated that during a period extending over thirty years he has treated thousands of persons habitually addicted to the use of the drugs, and has had ample oppor- tunity of observing the effects. He is of opinion that the habitual moderate use, provided good rich food be procurable, does not induce any physical effects for a long time. The ultimate effects of prolonged use of bhang, though moderate, weaken the nervous system and occasionally gives rise to palpitation of the heart. Ganja under the same conditions he has known to have caused bronchitis and dysentery. Witness No. 108 has had over 23 years' experience, and has never seen any noxious effects induced by the moderate use of any of the drugs. Assistant Surgeon Munna Lall (witness No. 123), who has had twenty years' experience, and witnesses Nos. 110 and 102 give similar evidence. Eight hospital assistants were examined. Jamal Khan, witness No. 113, is one of the old class of vernacular hospital assistants. He considers that daily use of the drugs in moderate quantity induces noxious effects. On oral examin- ation he stated: "Out of one hundred ganja smokers who come sick to the dispen- sary, I find that seventy-five have chronic bronchitis or dysentery and twenty- five have some mental disorder." Witness No. 121 is described as a pensioner, native doctor, and health officer, Aligarh, and gave evidence to the follow- ing effect: "It is not injurious to the constitution otherwise than by causing thinness..............At the time of their use the man suffers from asthma and bronchitis; after leaving their use, he suffers from diarrh214 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XI. and charas produce asthma. Witness No. 134, a private medical practitioner, considers the drugs injurious to the bowels and lungs. On cross-examination he stated: "There would be no harm to speak of if a man continued to be a moder- ate consumer of ganja or charas. But I think it difficult to keep the habit within bounds." Witness No. 136 stated: "Unless used as a digestive, causes asthma, deafness, and thinness." Witness No. 137 stated that ganja and charas (among other evils) cause "asthma to those who are weak." Bhang has no injurious effects unless taken in great excess. Witness No. 170, a native physi- cian, stated that "habitual consumers do not feel any physical, mental, or moral injury. They neither feel pain nor ever have cough." Witness No. 171 con- siders that bhang produces no noxious effects, but that ganja and charas cause dysentery, bronchitis, or asthma. Witness No. 172 states that ganja or charas may cause dysentery and asthma; bhang is less harmful. No reply is given to the question dealing with excess which is apparently not distinguished from the moderate use. Witness No. 143 considers that charas and ganja produce "various diseases." Witness No. 146 does not deal with the moder- ate use. Witness No. 147 considers that bhang and charas are both injuri- ous. "Bhang impairs the appetite in the end and charas causes bronchitis and asthma." Witness No. 173, a hakim of twenty years' experience, replied that "ganja often brings on bronchitis and asthma, and charas produces in- flammation of the stomach and liver. None of them, however, has been found to cause dysentery." Witness No. 149 considers that bronchitis and asthma are produced. Witness No. 151 stated that ganja produces bronchitis and asthma, but not dysentery. Witness No. 152 stated that the use of charas and ganja causes cough and asthma. Witness No. 153 stated that ganja and charas give rise to a number of diseases, "especially to complaints of the stomach, lungs, brain, liver, bowels, etc." Witness No. 174 considers that the use of ganja and charas causes bronchitis and asthma. Witness No. 160 stated that, in addition to bronchitis and asthma, dysentery is also caused. Witness No. 158 considers bhang to be harm- less, but that charas and ganja cause dysentery, bronchitis, and asthma. Witness No. 159, a vaid, stated that "ganja and charas weaken the heart, dry the consti- tution, and create lung diseases." Punjab. 503. In the Punjab, Surgeon-Major J. A. Cunningham, witness No. 35, of over 12 years' service, stated that charas and ganja smoked cause chest affections, but not dysentery. Surgeon-Major Dennys, witness No. 34, stated that "charas smokers, even in moderation, are generally emaciated and in poor health, and are depraved crea- tures both mentally and physically. This is not the case with moderate con- sumers of bhang as far as I have been able to gather." The witness does not mention any connection between the use of the drugs and chest affections or dysentery. Of the assistant surgeon and qualified private practitioner class eight were examined. Witness No. 48 is an L.M.S. and a private practitioner. He stated that "charas and ganja always bring on bronchitis and asthma if very large quantities are smoked. It brings on dysentery also." A perusal of this evidence indicates that the witness has mixed up the effects induced by moderate and exces- sive use of the drugs. Assistant Surgeon Jai Singh (witness No. 47) considers that the use of the drugs does not seem to cause bronchitis, asthma, or dysentery,
CH. XI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 215 but rather cures them. Witness No. 39, also an assistant surgeon, stated that the use of bhang is probably quite free from noxious effects, but abuse of charas brings on bronchitis and asthma. Assistant Surgeon Rahim Khan (witness No. 37) is Superintendent, Medical School, Lahore, and has had 33 years' residence in the Punjab, and has been connected with the out-patient department, Medical College Hospital, for that period. He stated: "There are no bad after effects from bhang, but even the moderate use of charas brings on chest affections." Cross-examined as to the meaning the witness attached to moderate, he replied: "I call ten or twelve chillums, costing one or two annas, in the 24 hours moderate use. I know of no more moderate use than that. I know of no case of a man using only one or two chillums a day. I would call a man taking one or two annas' worth a day a 'charasi'." It is clear that this witness knows nothing of the moderate use. Assistant Surgeon Mehr Chand (witness No. 40) stated that the moderate use of bhang produces no noxious effects, while charas, if even used moderately, brings on bronchitis and asthma, general irritation of the re- spiratory organs, indigestion, and dysentery. On cross-examination the witness said: "As to dysentery, I saw a case of a man who said he was a charas smoker, and took an excessive dose, and it brought on dysentery. I had doubt as to this being the cause. But I think charas may injure the digestion and predispose to diarrh216 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XI. causes asthma and bronchitis, but not dysentery. Witness No. 52 stated that "charas, of course, causes loss of appetite and bronchitis and asthma." Witness No. 53 merely stated: "The mischief is done by charas and ganja." Hakim Ghulam Nabi, of Lahore (witness No. 54), of twenty years' experience, stated: "I have not found even a single person during the last twenty years who com- plained of these drugs. There are more takias outside the Mochi Gate, Lahore, than in any other parts of the city which are reserved for the consumption of such drugs; and as the resorters to these takias generally come to me for treatment, and as none of them has during the last twenty years complained to me of having suffered from any disease in consequence of using bhang or charas, it shows that the moderate use of these drugs is harmless." Central Provinces. 504. In the Central Provinces three commissioned officers, one Honorary Sur- geon-Major, and two senior apothecaries were examin- ed. All these officers are of long service and con- siderable experience. One, an officer of forty years' service, did not discriminate between the effects induced by moderate and excessive use of the drugs, and his replies to questions dealing with the moderate use are consequently valueless. One witness stated that the moderate use of ganja and bhang does not ordinarily produce any noxious effects, but that ganja sometimes causes chronic catarrh. A second witness stated that no evil effects are induced; then added that bronchitis and asthma may be caused by ganja smoking, but not dysentery. Surgeon-Major Quayle (witness No. 37), who had resided four years in a district where the drug is extensively cultivated, and where it is easily procurable in the adjoining Native States, alleged that he had no evidence that the moderate use of the drug produces any noxious effects-physical, mental, or moral. Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel McKay (witness No. 36), after twenty years' service in the country, gives no reply to the Commission's questions dealing with the effects of moderate or excessive use of the drugs. Brigade-Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Gaffney, after 25 years' service as a Civil Surgeon in the Central Provinces, stated: "I do not think the moderate use produces any of these ill effects." One assistant surgeon was examined in the Central Provinces, a man of 22 years' service, who was of opinion that, while the moderate use of bhang would not cause bronchitis, dysentery, or asthma, these remote effects might be induced by ganja. One hospital assistant who was examined stated on cross-examination: "I have never seen an asthma, bronchitis, or dysentery case arising from ganja." Another pensioned hospital assistant was of opinion that the moderate use of ganja, charas, and bhang does produce noxious physical, mental, and moral effects; ganja causing dysentery, bronchitis, and asthma; bhang making a person unusually fat, affecting the urinary system, and causing bronchocele and hydrocele. One vaid was examined, 55 years of age, who had known hundreds of ganja smokers, and had never known a case in which it did any harm. He had himself been a steady ganja smoker for thirty years, consuming six to eight chillumsdaily. Madras. 505. In Madras twenty commissioned and uncovenanted officers, of whom eleven either failed to reply or did not discriminate between the effects of moderate and excessive use, were examined. Surgeon-Major King (witness No. 85), nineteen years' service, sixteen
CH. XI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 217 of which have been spent in civil employ, stated that in the habitual moderate smoker bronchitis is frequent. Cross-examined as to the basis of his observation of the general effects induced by the drugs, he stated: "I have known the moderate use in cases of sepoys and one private servant.......Besides the above direct ob- servations, I have derived general impressions.......My general impression is based upon the fact that persons alleged to have been ganja smokers have presented these characteristics, but I have not specially inquired into the truth of the allegation that they were ganja smokers. They were pointed out as notorious ganja smokers. I did not discriminate in these cases between the moderate and excessive use because I was not called upon to do so." Surgeon-Major O'Hara (witness No. 93) stated that apparently no ill effects are caused, and that he has no inform- ation regarding specific affections alleged to be induced by the drugs. Sur- geon-Major Sturmer (witness No. 99), of nearly nineteen years' service, said regarding effects of moderate use: "In time, I believe, it leads to mental and moral degradation." Cross-examined as to the basis of his information, the wit- ness said: "I have never been into the question of ganja. I have never seen it scarcely. My first sentence (the one quoted above) is based on what a ganja smoker said. He said: 'It is a bad thing. I should like to leave it off, but I cannot.' I have really no experience as to the effects of either moderate or excessive use." Surgeon-Major W. F. Thomas (witness No. 96), of fifteen years' service, only three of which have been passed in civil employ, stated that users of the drugs suffer from dysentery, bronchitis, and asthma. On cross-examination the witness said: "I had to treat three cases of ganja poisoning. These men drank liquor and indulged in ganja. In all these cases there was congestion of the lungs present.........These are the only three cases in which the evil effects of the drug have come directly under my notice. The symptoms in all three cases were the same, and for that reason I concluded the pulmonary affection to be the result of the drug. I have learnt from enquiry from medical subordinates and people in villages that dysentery, bronchitis, and asthma result from the drug. I have no personal experience on the point." Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Hyde (witness No. 86) stated that, so far as he knew, no ill effects were caused. Surgeon-Major Lancaster (witness No. 90), twenty years' service, nineteen of which have been passed in civil employ, in his oral examination said: "I have had no opportunity of noticing the effects of the moderate use of hemp drugs; they have not come before me." Surgeon-Major Pemberton (witness No. 98), of fifteen years' service, and in civil employ continuously since 1885, stated that evil effects are induced, but asthma is relieved, and bronchitis and dysentery are not caused. Surgeon-Major N. Chattarji (witness No. 88), of nearly seventeen years' service, nearly all in military employ, stated: "It does not produce any particular disease except a peculiar cough, the result of a kind of chronic bronchial catarrh." On cross-examination the witness said: "I cannot in the case of any sepoy attribute thinness or cough to ganja, for I cannot be certain. I have no proof............ What I have said in my written answer about thinness and cough is myimpression; but I could not assert it about any particular case." Civil Apothecary A. Wells (witness No. 105) has about nine years' service. He stated that bronchitis, asthma, and dysentery are not caused by the drugs, but relieved by them. Dr. K. J. Naidu (witness No. 106) stated that no ill effects are caused. Surgeon-Captain C. Fearnside (witness No. 97) considers that the drugs "impair the constitution, causing weakness of the limbs and other tissues, and hence the drug has 55
218 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XI. to be taken to keep up the tone of these tissues. It causes indigestion in many." No information is given about any specific affections being induced. Surgeon- Major-General DeFabeck (witness No. 83) was Surgeon-General with the Government of Madras. He had served in Madras and Burma since 1857. Onoral examination the witness stated: "My experience is that it is a very rare thing to meet with any case in which the hemp drug has caused evil effects on the health of the population. Apart from insanity, no evil effects have been brought to my notice." Seven apothecaries and private practitioners were examined. Civil Apothecary T. M. Cheriyan (witness No. 100), of nine years' service, stated: "It causes bron- chitis and asthma"; and he also referred to other evil effects. On cross-examination the witness said regarding effects: "All the statements made here are based exclusively on hearsay. I have not seen any of these ill effects myself in my practice............I do not know of any case of illness that has come before me of any kind being due to hemp drugs." Civil Apothecary K. Vasudeva Rao (witness No. 101),of six years' service, stated, under the question relating to effects, that he was once called to see a bairagi who was a habitual smoker of opium and ganja, and that he was a ghostly skeleton of bones covered with skin. No other physical effects are mentioned. On oral examination the witness said: "I did not treat the bairagi; I only saw him once; and, apart from his own statement that he was an habitual smoker of opium and ganja, I learnt nothing whatever of his history. I cannot, therefore, judge whether his condi- tion was due to other causes than the habits he confessed to." Civil Apothecary Mohammad Asadulla (witness No. 104) stated that the drugs caused bronchitis and other evil effects. Cross-examined, he said that he had "treated cases of asthma, bronchitis, and the like which have resulted from prolonged use of the drugs, but he could not recall any such cases." Civil Apothecary G. A. Vellones (witness No. 102) gave a negative reply regarding causation of specific diseases. Assistant Surgeon Saldana (witness No. 107) stated that "consumers say no noxious effects are produced so long as sufficient food is supplied." Civil Apothecary N. H. Daniel (witness No. 103) considered that evil effects were induced, including dysentery and bronchitis. Thirteen hospital assistants were examined. Witness No. 119, a pensioned hospital assistant, considers that the habitual moderate use never produces any bad effects, or causes dysentery, bronchitis, or asthma. Witnesses Nos. 108 and 109 also gave a reply in the negative regarding specific diseases. Witness No. 111, of 22 years' experience, considers that the habitual consumer generally exceeds moderation; no specific diseases are mentioned as being caused by moderate use. Witness No. 113 stated that, while bhang does not produce any noxious evil effects, smoking ganja does. Witness No. 114 stated: "It produces noxious effects." Wit- ness No. 115, of thirteen years' service, on the other hand, stated: "I have not observed any noxious effects." Witness No. 116, of fourteen years' service, con- siders that, with the exception of a "kind of hoarse cough in ganja smokers," no noxious effects are produced by the use of bhang or ganja. The remaining wit- nesses either failed to reply or were not examined on the effects induced by moderate use. Six native practitioners were examined. Witnesses Nos. 121 and 123 stated that the habitual moderate use of ganja or bhang does not produce any noxious
CH. XI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 219 effects. Witness No. 135 stated: "It impairs the constitution by making the man lean; increases digestion, and removes dysentery and cough." Witness No. 124 stated: "The use of these drugs produces moral effects, physical and mental, only to those people who are accustomed to it, and not in any way distinctive." No. 125 stated: "No doubt it produces noxious effects. In the long run they were subjected to bronchitis, and their eyes became dark gradually." This witness fails to answer the question dealing with excessive use, and has not apparently discriminated between the two uses of the drug. The remaining witnesses failed to reply. Bombay. 506. Thirteen commissioned medical officers were examined in Bombay, of whom three were examined only regarding asylum pro- cedure in relation to insanity. Of the remaining ten, Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel McConaghy (witness No. 69) is an officer of nearly 25 years' service, fifteen of which have been passed in the Civil Department. He stated that the moderate use of bhang or ganja does not impair the constitution in any way. Surgeon-Major Kirtikar (witness No. 73) has served over sixteen years, eleven of which have been in civil employ. He stated: "I have not seen nor have I heard from any reliable source of dysentery, asthma, or bronchitis being traced to the use of hemp in modera- tion. European physicians use it for the cure of dysentery." Surgeon-Major Boyd (witness No. 67), of about seventeen years' service, of which three-and- a-half years have been in military employ, stated: "Neither have I known any cases where it caused dysentery, bronchitis, and asthma." Surgeon-Major Parakh (wit- ness No. 66) does not refer to specific diseases being induced. In his paper he refers to "homicidal insanity" being due to the moderate use, but in his oral exa- mination he stated that probably he had in mind cases due to excessive use, and his reply should be taken as referring to the excessive use. Surgeon-Lieutenant- Colonel Bartholomeusz (witness No. 68), of over twenty years' service, stated: "I have not seen a sufficient number of cases to enable me to give a definite opinion;" and he does not deal with excessive use. Brigade-Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel J. Arnott (witness No. 65), of about twenty-five years' service, replies to the question dealing with effects of moderate use by entering the word "yes" four times without explanation; and he does not answer the question which treats of excessive use. Brigade-Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel G. A. Maconachie (witness No. 64), of about twenty-five years' service, stated that he knows nothing about the subject. Surgeon- Colonel D. Hughes (witness No. 74), of twenty-seven years' service, of which fourteen were in military employ, is Principal Medical Officer in Bombay, Deesa and Aden districts. He stated: "I think the smoking of charas causes asthma and bronchitis, as I well remember cases of these diseases in the 24th Bombay Infantry which were ascribed by the hospital assistant and the men's comrades to charas smoking, and which recovered in hospital quicker than cases due to ordinary causes." On cross- examination the witness said: "I remember that when the yearly inspection for pension took place...... a number of men, of service only just long enough to earn pension, came up suffering from bronchitis and asthma. They were generally weak and broken down in appearance, but this may have been caused by voluntary starva- tion...... It was explained to me that they owed this illness to charas smoking. I did not certify in any case that the illness of a man who was granted pension was due to charas. I am bound to state that an applicant's disease was not aggra- vated by vice or intemperance, but I took no notice of the use of the drug in

This evidence, reject- ed at the time, is the only basis of the opinion now expressed. Surgeon-Major- General Turnbull (witness No. 63), of 33 years' service, Surgeon-General with the Government of Bombay, stated: "I have no personal experience of the effects of the hemp drugs on the people." Surgeon-Major D. C. Davidson (witness No. 71) stated: "So far as I can learn, the moderate use of ganja in smoking does not appear to be either physically or mentally injurious, gene- rally speaking." Eleven officers belonging to the assistant surgeon and qualified private prac- titioner class were examined. Witness No. 76 stated: "I think it does not cause dysentery, bronchitis, or asthma." Witness No. 90 stated: "It does produce dry cough eventuating in bronchitis or asthma, but it does not seem to produce dysentery, so far as my experience goes." Witness No. 91 gives a negative reply to ill effects being caused by moderate use. Witness No. 79 stated: "I have not noticed any other disease to result from occasional or moderate use of ganja or bhang in any form." The disease referred to was general atrophy, and death from the use of majum. Witness No. 77 stated that no ill effects are produced. Witness No. 78 stated that he has had no opportunity for observing effects. Witness No. 82 stated that injurious effects are produced.

Witnesses Nos. 98 and 99, vaidyas, gave similar evidence to the last witness. Witness No. 100, also a vaidya, stated no ill effects are caused by the moderate use of bhang; but he does not express any opinion on the effects caused by moderate use of ganja. Witness No. 92 is described as a medical practitioner of 27 years' experience, and does not think that noxious effects are produced. Witness No. 93, also a medical practitioner, stated: "They do not cause dysen- tery, bronchitis, or asthma, but, on the contrary, do good to these diseases." Witness No. 94 does not reply. Witness No. 95, also a medical practitioner, stated: "I have not met with any cases in which the habitual moderate use of bhang has produced any noxious effects, ..................... but I believe the habitual moderate use of ganja and charas does produce some noxious effect physically, mentally, and morally." Sind. 507. Three commissioned officers were examined in Sind. Brigade-Surgeon- Lieutenant-Colonel J. F. Keith (witness No. 16) has had twenty-five years' service, of which 14 have been passed in Sind and 15 in civil employ. He stated that a general negative may be given to the questions dealing with noxious effects from moderate use. Surgeon- Major Corkery (witness No. 17) stated that the moderate use of these drugs does not produce any immediate noxious effects; but if bhang is indulged in for a considerable period, it impairs the constitution and produces emaciation. "At first it acts as a digestive, but afterwards impairs it, giving rise to asthma and bron- chitis, but not dysentery." Brigade-Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Bainbridge (witness No. 15) has acted as Civil Surgeon for 26 years. He stated: "I have no evidence, but I should say that the habitual moderate use of any of these drugs is harmful." Four officers of the assistant surgeon class and one medical officer of health were examined. Witness No. 1 stated that no ill effects are produced. Dr. S. M. Kaka (witness No. 24) is medical officer of health at Karachi, and has practised there since 1884. The witness stated: "The habitual moderate use of ganja and charas acts injuriously upon the constitution physically, mentally, and morally." In cross-examination he stated: "It is difficult to draw a definite line between moderate and excessive use. They merge into one another." Witness No. 19 stated: "I am of opinion that moderate use of subzi does not produce any noxious effects-physical, mental, or moral." And Surgeon J. E. Bocarro (witness No. 20) stated: "I cannot say this of bhang, but charas and ganja, even in moderate doses, tend to weaken the bodily frame..................... As regards causing the diseases mentioned, I have not a single case on record to warrant such a conclusion so far as bhang is concerned, but several of my cases indicate that the continued use of charas and ganja do cause dysentery and bronchitis. I have no history regarding asthma." Witness No. 21 stated that the habitual moderate use of the drugs does not cause dysentery, bronchitis, or asthma. In Sind two hospital assistants and no private practitioners were examined. Witness No. 22 stated no ill effects are caused. Witness No. 23 stated that the use "causes bronchitis and shortness of breath." Burma. 508. Eight commissioned officers were examined in Burma. Surgeon-Major Thomas (witness No. 42) stated that no ill effects were produced by moderate doses. Surgeon-Major Dantra (witness No. 40) has had 17 years' service, nearly the whole in Burma, and 56
222 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XI. stated: "It neither causes dysentery nor asthma, but it produces cough." Surgeon- Major P. W. Dalzell (witness No. 41) stated: "I am not aware that it causes either dysentery, bronchitis, or asthma." Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Mukerji (witness No. 39) has 26 years' service, and stated: "I have seen several habitual moderate smokers who did not suffer at all either physically, mentally, or morally. Others have injured their constitutions by use of ganja and charas." Surgeon- Captain Castor (witness No. 44) stated: "Not so far as I know. Causes oss of appetite." The remaining witnesses do not reply to the question. Three assistant surgeons were examined. Witness No. 46 stated: "Habitual moderate use has apparently no noxious effect." Assistant Surgeon Moonshi (witness No. 45) has 21 years' service, and stated: "I have known habitual moderate consumers of these drugs to enjoy robust health." According to the witness, the drugs do not cause bronchitis, asthma, or dysentery; "on the contrary, asthmatic people often resort to it to allay their sufferings. Immoderate use causes gastro-intestinal irritation." The third witness was not examined regarding effects of moderate use. One hospital assistant was examined (witness No. 48), who stated: "The moderate use does not cause dysentery and bronchitis." No private practitioners were examined. Berar, etc. 509.

The medical evidence which has thus been analysed very clearly indi- cates in the opinion of the Commission that when the basis of the opinions as to the alleged evil effects of the moderate use of the drugs is subjected to careful examination, the grounds on which the allegations are founded prove to be in the highest degree defective. A large number of medical witnesses of all classes ascribe dysentery, bronchitis, and asthma to the moderate use of the drugs. An equally representa- tive number give a diametrically opposite opinion. The most striking feature of the medical evidence is perhaps the large number of practitioners of long experience who have seen no evidence of any connection between hemp drugs and disease, and when witnesses who speak to these ill effects from the moderate use are cross-examined, it is found that (a) their opinions are based on popular ideas on the subject; (b) they have not discriminated between the effects of moderate and excessive use of the drugs; (c) they have accepted the diseases as being induced by hemp drugs because the patients confessed to the habit; and (d) the fact has been overlooked that the smoking of hemp drugs is recognized as a remedial agent in asthma and bronchitis. A few witnesses incidentally refer to personal idiosyncrasy as perhaps being a factor in render- ing some consumers of the drugs less tolerant and more liable to be affected by them even when used in moderate quantity. This view the Commission are pre- pared to accept; but for the vast majority of consumers, the Commission consider that the evidence shows the moderate use of ganja or charas not to be appreciably harmful, while in the case of moderate bhang drinking the evidence shows the habit to be quite harmless. As in long-continued and excessive cigarette smoking considerable bronchial irritation and chronic catarrhal laryngitis may be induced, so, too, may a similar condition be caused by excessive ganja or charas smoking; and to the 224 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XI. siddhi tipplers than among other people of the same class. What does happen is that digestion is impaired, the daily consumption of such a dose of narcotic overburdens the alimentary and eliminating systems, the man's appetite goes, and the food he takes is not properly absorbed. The symptoms mentioned are the signs of this indigestion, and the impaired vitality which renders the system unable to throw off an illness is its results." With lowered vitality due to any cause, it must be obvious that an individual is more liable to be affected by vicissitudes of weather and bad sanitary surroundings than a person in normal health; and it may be accepted that excessive consumption of any intoxicant does tend to lower vitality. Excessive consumers of the drug are therefore probably more liable to bowel-affections. As regards the indirect effects of the drug when smoked, it is likely that the excessive consumers also commit excesses of other kinds, while the excessive smoking also tends to diminish the appetite: the money which should be spent for the purpose of procuring wholesome and nutritious foodCHAPTER XII. EFFECTS226 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XII. which is seen to produce such symptoms should be readily accepted by the popu- lar mind as a cause of insanity. This popular idea has been greatly strengthened by the attitude taken up by Asylum Superintendents. They have known nothing of the effects of the drugs at all, though the consumption is so extensive, except that cases of insanity have been brought to them attributed with apparent authority to hemp drugs. They have generalised from this limited and one-sided experience. They have concluded that hemp drugs produce insanity in every case, or in the great majority of the cases, of consumption. They have had no idea that in the vast majority of cases this result does not follow the use. They have accordingly without sufficient inquiry assisted by the statistics they have supplied and by the opinions they have expressed in stereotyping the popular opinion and giving it authority and permanence. All this mass of popular and medical opinion demanded careful examination. The Commission have set themselves to take evidence from lay witnesses and to sift as far as possible the cases mentioned so as to ascertain the basis of the popular view. They have also examined medical men of all classes as to cases of the alleged connection between hemp drugs and insanity which have come before them in their practice, and have cross-examined them carefully in regard to these cases so as to see whether the grounds for the opinion formed in each case are adequate. Finally, they have very carefully considered the asylum statistics, and specially enquired into a large number of asylum cases. It has become apparent in the course of the inquiry that no satisfactory conclu- sion can be based on the individual cases reported by witnesses. As a rule, it is made manifest at once by cross-examination that the history of the patient has not formed the subject of careful inquiry; that the opinion is based on most inadequate data; and that little or no importance has been attached to the question of causation. The Commission have therefore been compelled to fall back on the asylums. This course seems clearly expedient on two groundsCH.

If we make the attempt, we shall soon find how difficult it is to get an accurate account of the health of the father or mother and grand- father and grandmother of any one patient." On the wider subject of causa- tion generally, Dr. Hack Tuke (Dictionary of Psychological Medicine; article "Statistics of Insanity") says: "As the Lunacy Commissioners adopt a classifica- tion of the causes of insanity which is fairly workable, and have collected together a large number of returns from English asylums, it is desirable to give the results here for what they are worth. As is well known, the entries made by the friends of patients in the statutory statement are extremely unreliable, and constantly confound cause and effect. The Commissioners state that they have not relied upon these, but upon statements verified by the medical officers of the asylum." Asylum statistics. 515. If this be the case in England, how much more is it necessary in India to exercise caution in receiving statistics as to the causes of insanity, to examine carefully the source from which they come, and to rely only on those which have been carefully tested. The Com- mission in examining the statistics of the lunatic asylums soon found that they could not be regarded as trustworthy. They first of all enquired into a number of cases in the Dullunda Asylum (Calcutta), and ascertained generally the practice in regard to recording the cause in the asylum registers, and the character of the inquiry on which that record was based. What they learned there led them to distrust the asylum statistics. They determined to make a careful inquiry into all cases attributed to hemp drugs in one year, and to endeavour thus to ascertain how far the statistics were reasonably correct, and, if possible, also to arrive at some conclusion as to whether hemp drugs have any real connection with insanity. They fixed on the year 1892. They considered it for obvious reasons expedient to take the same year all over India; and this was the last year for which complete statistics existed when they began their inquiry. At the same time these statistics had been completed and printed before the proposal to have any inquiry into the effects of ganja had been made. The Commission decided to take up each of these cases of 1892 separately, and to inquire as fully as possible into its history. Hitherto any opinion regarding the connection between hemp drugs and insanity which has professed to have any solid basis at all, or to be more than a vague impression, has been based on the figures contained in the annual Statement No. VII appended to the Asylum Reports. It is necessary to con- sider how far these figures supply any reasonable basis for a scientific opinion on the question. The figures contained in that statement are compiled from the entries as to cause made in the asylum registers. The great majority of the Superintend- ents of Asylums have clearly stated that these entries are based on the de- scriptive rolls sent with the lunatics. They have not considered it necessary to enquire how far the descriptive rolls are likely to give trustworthy information regarding cause, how or by what agency that information is collected, or bywhom it is supplied. It has been sufficient that it is sent to them officially, and that they have no opportunities of testing it. They have therefore accepted it. If the papers have been manifestly incomplete, they have been sent back to the Magistrate for completion. The practically universal rule has been to
228 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XII. accept the cause entered in the descriptive roll, and only to make enquiries in the asylum when no cause had been entered. It cannot be said that even this practice has been carefully and accurately observed. The copying of the entries is left to subordinates who sometimes use their own discretion. Thus Dr. McConaghy, Superintendent of the Poona Asylum, says: "The register is filled up by the assistant at the time of the lunatic's admission. According to my idea of asylum practice, the entries must be in accordance with Form C. If the cause is entered as unknown, it must be so shown in the register. No altera- tion would be made without the permission of the Magistrate." Yet of the six cases ascribed to hemp drugs in 1892, there was not one in respect to which the entry in the register corresponded with that of the descriptive roll as to cause, and there was nothing on record to explain the discrepancy in any case. Simi- larly, Dr. Macnamara, Superintendent of the Tezpur Asylum, says: "The cause is entered in the general register from the police statement, i.e., from the descriptive roll. We have nothing whatever to do with it. It is entered by the Overseer in charge of the Asylum, and ought to correspond with the entry of the descriptive roll." As a matter of fact, eleven of the thirteen cases for 1892 showed entries regarding cause which did not correspond with the descriptive rolls; and of these 11, no less than 10 were made, not by the Overseer, but by his subordinate, the jemadar. Besides such errors as these, there are errors arising from carelessness in the mere copying of the register entries from year to year. These derive their importance from the fact that they must have been discovered had any attention been really given in the asylums to this matter of causation. A striking example may be given from among the old cases in the Rangoon Asylum. Moung Min Thay was admitted on 25th June 1871. There has been no improvement in his mental state. There are no papers in his case except an order from the Magistrate to receive the man "supposed to be in- sane." The original entry in the case book shows cause as "predisposing disease of the brain, exciting drinks, and smokes opium;" and it shows the duration as "probably from birth." It also shows that the man was epileptic. There is no mention of ganja. The register for 1885 (the first to show causation) shows "alleged duration" as "congenital," and "alleged cause" as "drink and opium smoking." The entry "congenital" is continued until 1892, when it is replaced by a "Do." under the "Not given" of a previous case. In 1886 the "cause" similarly undergoes undesigned alteration. The word "drink" is replaced by "ganja;" and in 1888 the reference to "opium" is finally dropped. The case thus became a ganja case, and has been shown as such ever since. These all may be instances of exceptional carelessness, but as a general rule it cannot be said that these entries have been made with care. Superintendents have not attached much importance to them. It has been left to subordinates to do this work; and that work as a rule has not been carefully supervised. Speak- ing generally, however, Superintendents have desired that the entries in the register regarding cause should correspond with those in the descriptive rolls; and they have believed that their subordinates were making the entries on this principle. Some few Superintendents have professed a different method, and have assumed some responsibility for the entries as to the cause of insanity in their registers. There are, however, only three Superintendents who held this office in 1892 who profess to have been to any appreciable extent independent of the
CH. XII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 229 police statements or descriptive rolls. The first of these is Brigade-Surgeon- Lieutenant-Colonel Hooper, who says that his "practice has not been to enter the cause at once, but to wait until a diagnosis of the case has been made. Then, if the supposed cause, as shown in the Magistrate's statement, is not inconsistent with the diagnosis of the insanity, or with the information received from friends who may have come, or with statements made by the man himself if he recovers sufficiently, that cause is entered in the register." The part played by diagnosis in the determination of cause is, however, somewhat visionary; for Dr. Hooper says that there are no symptoms peculiar to hemp drug insanity except perhaps more speedy recovery, and that an accurate history is "absolutely essential;it is the only means by which you can arrive at a diagnosis." As to the state- ments of friends, Dr. Hooper seems to think that friends visit patients in the majority of cases. If this is so in Lucknow, his experience differs from that of Superintendents elsewhere. It is possible, however, that he may be mistaken, for it appears that enquiries from friends are "not ordinarily" made by him, but by the Deputy Superintendent. The statements of lunatics also appear from his evidence rarely to affect the entries. There is one point on which Dr. Hooper specially insists, viz., that any fact established regarding heredity would exclude the ganja theory. Turning to the cases for 1892, it is found that there was one case in which the lunatic's brother was insane, and another where a direct an- cestor was insane; but no notice was taken of these facts in determining cause, and the cases were entered as due to hemp drugs. It also appears that in 14 out of the 17 cases shown as due to hemp drugs, this cause is entered in accord- ance either with the entry in the papers regarding cause, or with that regarding the lunatic's habits. Of the remaining three cases, there is in one an alleged statement by the lunatic's brother (afterwards denied). In another the lunatic "recognizes bhang and makes contradictory statements as to its use." In the third, there is the statement of the lunatic himself while still insane. The second Superintendent who states that he adopts exceptional practice is Brigade-Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Keith of Hyderabad (Sind), who says that "the only ground, so far as I can remember, on which I would enter cause would be information of friends or the statement of the insane after he had recovered his wits." It is striking that of the 13 cases set down to hemp drugs in 1892, the cause as entered in the register corresponds in 10 cases with that entered in the papers sent with the lunatic. In the other three cases no basis for the entry of cause is given at all. In one case the Superintendent told the members of the Commission who visited the asylum that the entry was based on a statement made by the father; this the father now denies. In the other two cases, no such explanation was given by Dr. Keith to the members of the Com- mission; but that officer now says (probably on the authority of some subordinate) that these two lunatics used to ask for the drug in the asylum. No record of any such fact was found in the register. The Commission are unable in view of all that has been ascertained of these cases to attach much weight to these statements. The third exceptional case is that of Surgeon-Major Dobie of Madras. In his letter of 20th October 1893 (vide Vol. II Appendices) Dr. Dobie said: "I am responsible for the entry of the cause as ganja in the first 14 cases [of 1892]. In no case have I entered it as a cause without such evidence as led me 58
230 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XII. to a reasonable belief that it was so." But in his evidence before the Commis- sion on 22nd January 1894, this officer stated: "My reasonable belief as to cause was based on reading the papers and seeing whether they showed a probable cause of insanity, and on enquiry from the lunatic.............I feel very little confidence in the diagnosis I have made ascribing these cases to hemp drugs." Statistics are based on the de- scriptive rolls. 516. There is clearly no valid ground in the practice of these three Superintend- ents for modifying the general statement based on the frank admission of the great majority of the Superin- tendents that the entries regarding cause in the registers, and therefore the figures in annual Statement No. VII, have been based wholly on the descriptive rolls or similar papers received with the lunatics. This practice has, no doubt, become established owing to the following considerations. As already stated, many Super- intendents have recognized these papers as practically the only material they had for determining cause. They have not had adequate opportunities for making enquiries themselves. They have had a general impression that the informa- tion supplied by Magistrates or police was as good as the Government required for statistical purposes, and they have accepted it accordingly. As a rule they have regarded this question of cause as one of little or no practical import- ance. The Government prescribed Statement VII, and pressed to have the columns filled up; and as a rule the orders were carried out in this somewhat mechanical way. Surgeon-Major Carruthers, Superintendent at Calicut, per- haps puts this view in the strongest terms when he says: "My position as Superintendent of the Lunatic Asylum requires me to take charge of insanes when they are sent in, and retain them until they are fit for discharge. I am simply keeper and incidentally medical attendant, and not responsible for any statements and certificates received with the patient so long as they are in order." The same view is, however, as clearly expressed by Brigade-Surgeon- Lieutenant-Colonel Hooper when he says: "I do not consider that the ques- tion of cause is one which affects the treatment of cases. My inquiries there- fore into cause are of a statistical, not a practical, character. The result will not affect my treatment of the case." Even to an officer who sees that the know- ledge of the cause may help him in the treatment of the case, responsibility for the accuracy of the returns is a very minor matter. Surgeon-Lieutenant- Colonel Leapingwell (Vizagapatam), for example, says: "The point, of course, is chiefly one of personal interest to me in the treatment of the case. An entry was made (in the particular case under discussion) on the papers. I omitted to alter the register." It is clear then that the medical officers in charge of asylums have not felt that they have been in any way responsible for the accu- racy of the figures contained in annual Statement VII regarding causation of insanity; and that these figures derive no value from the fact that the statement bears the signature of a medical man; for their value practically depends entirely on the character of the inquiry in which the information contained in the de- scriptive roll was in each case collected. Untrustworthiness of descriptive rolls. 517. This inquiry is very unequal in its character. The lunatic, before being sent to the asylum, is for a time under the observation of the Civil Surgeon. The latter has to certify to the man's insanity and to the facts which have led to that conclusion. Sometimes the Civil Surgeon fills up the descriptive roll as well as the medical certificate. But the more general practice is that he confines his attention to
CH. XII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 231 the medical certificate, leaving the descriptive roll, which contains all that is known of the lunatic's history, to be filled up by the Magistrate or the police. Where it is the practice for the Civil Surgeon to fill up the descriptive roll, the entry regarding cause is made by him or under his orders. Even in that case, however, he is generally compelled to accept the statements of the police. The majority of the lunatics sent up are wanderers who have no friends. Friends, even when there are any, are averse to appear lest they should be called on to contribute to the support of the lunatic. The following statements may be taken as typical of the usual experience of Civil Surgeons in this respect: "As Civil Surgeon, I got the information from friends or from the police. Very often I had cases where no friends came. In such cases I trusted to the police or wherever I could get my information" (Surgeon-Major Boyd, Colaba). "The information I give in Form C is generally very incomplete, as I have only the lunatic to get it from" (Surgeon-Major Burke, Poona). "The friends very rarely attend. As a rule, then, I am left entirely to the statement or form received and to the police" (Surgeon-Major Emerson, Bareilly). Thus, even where the Civil Surgeon signs the descriptive roll, he bases his entries therein as a rule on information supplied by the police. The more general practice is therefore also the more correct, to have the descriptive roll formally filled in by the police and signed by a Police officer or Magistrate, as the police supply the information. The inquiry into the history of the case is not an inquiry conducted by a pro- fessional man from the persons likely to know most about the lunatic. The information consists often merely of the guesses of police officers as to the history and habits of a friendless and homeless wanderer; and in other cases, where a local inquiry is possible, it is generally made by a subordinate police officer. "I am aware," says the Surgeon-General of the Bombay Presidency, "that inquiries in these cases are generally conducted by a subordinate officer of police." Surgeon-Captain Walsh, of the Calcutta Asylum, says: "The de- scriptive rolls are filled up as a rule by a Native Police Inspector on the informa- tion of a native policeman." Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Bovill, of Patna, goes further. He says: "The statements in the descriptive rolls regarding cause are as a rule not very reliable. I cannot say what grade of police records them. But I think the information is often in small villages brought by chaukidars." Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Crombie, Superintendent, General Hospital, Calcutta, says: "The inquiry is made by the police. I have myself seen an inquiry going on in which a constable was filling in the papers from the statements of the lunatic himself, the man being at the time insane. This may be exceptional, but I have seen it. In any case I distrust this descriptive roll." These are some typical statements regarding the agency which, as a rule, collects the information on which the asylum statistics as to cause are based. Some- times, as at head-quarters, the inquiring police officer may be an Inspector; but, as a rule, he is very subordinate. It is impossible to share the cheerful optimism of Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel O'Brien, of Benares, who says that "when ganja is assigned, the man was probably 2 notorious ganja smoker. The inquiry may be conducted by a chaprassi, yet he might be right in that." It would be absurd to accept without great distrust the statements, especially as to the cause of insanity, compiled by such an agency as has been described.
232 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XII. This distrust of the descriptive roll is intensified when the source of the information is considered. If the police think it worth while, or find it possible and convenient, to make anything of the nature of an inquiry, they find that they have to be satisfied with the very poorest material. Sometimes, as shown above, it is the statement of the lunatic himself while still insane that is recorded, not only as to history and habits, but also even as to the cause of his insanity. Often, as in the case of garden coolies in Assam or wandering mendicants all over India, it is the statements of mere casual acquaintances who know little of the lunatic's habits and nothing of his past history or of that of his family. Even when friends are found from whom inquiry can be made, they are generally of the most ignorant and unintelligent type. It is from the classes of such a type that most of the inmates of our asylums are taken. It is very rare indeed to find one of the higher and more intelligent classes. The ignorant and unedu- cated persons who ascribe a child's epilepsy to his having accidently touched the painted stone that represents the village god while playing under the sacred tree, or a fit of insanity to the attack and possession of a bht or village ghost, who know nothing of causality, except in the most ordinary affairs of home or agricultural life, beyond the mere association of coincidence, who believe in no cause which they do not see except witchcraft, whose powers of observation are quite unexercised and undeveloped: such persons must form most unpromis- ing material even for the most patient and intelligent enquirers to work on. The information gleaned from them by such agency as has been above described must be of the most incomplete and unsatisfactory character. It is not surpris- ing that moral causes of insanity, being much less palpable than physical causes, should sometimes be overlooked. A much more surprising fact is the ignoring of many physical causes. Dr. Wise, then Superintendent of the Dacca Asylum, gave a remarkable illustration of this in his report for 1872: "It is a curious circumstance that in Bengal insanity is never traced to blows on the head, which in Europe is a not infrequent cause. This is the more surprising, as there are few races, I believe, who so commonly have marks of blows on their heads as Bengalis. Out of 190 males in the asylum on 1st January last, 57 (or 30 per cent.) had more or less extensive scars or cuts or contusions on the head. In a considerable proportion the blow must have been so severe as to have caused violent concussion of the brain. Yet in the records of this asylum there is no instance of insanity attributed to this cause." Finally, the distrust of the descriptive roll must be further intensified by the consideration of the pressure brought to bear on subordinates to supply information as to cause. An illustration of this may be found as early as 1863 in the Resolution of the Government of Bengal on the Asylum Reports for 1862. And a striking illustration of the effect of this pressure is found in the Dullunda Asylum returns for the following year (1863), in which the cause in several cases dating from the year 1857 and onwards was altered from "unknown" to "ganja smoking." The same pressure is still brought to bear on those responsible for the entries of cause. Surgeon-Major-General Turnbull, the head of the Medical Department in Bombay, says: "There is a column in Statement VII headed "Unknown" which is intended for the entry of cases in which the cause has not been ascertained with reasonable accuracy. If this column was largely used, I should think it would be a matter of censure on the person on whom the re- sponsibility for inquiry rests." This demand for much information where little
CH. XII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 233 information is available, and this insistence on ascribing a cause where reasonable presumption as to cause is so rarely possible, have had a powerful influence in rendering the statistics untrustworthy. The same tendency is seen at work in other provinces. In Madras the effect of the remark in paragraph 5 of the Government Resolution on the Lunatic Asylum Report for 1890 stigmatizing the Calicut Asylum as "the worst " in respect to the average of unknown causes and of the Surgeon-General's Circular No. 12, dated 28th September 1891 (issued in consequence), is clearly in evidence. In Bengal, Surgeon-Lieutenant- Colonel Meadows, of Berhampur, says: "We assign cause too often ourselves: it is insisted on; and we are constrained to enter cause before it has been properly ascertained." Surgeon-Major Baker, of Rangoon, says: "I think that officers are under the impression that it looks as if they were not zealous if they do not find a cause." Brigade-Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Gaffney, of Jubbul- pore, says: "I think that there is a tendency to assign causes too readily;" and he intimates his concurrence in a strong protest made by Surgeon-Major-Gen- eral Rice when Civil Surgeon of Jubbulpore in 1880 against this tendency. In Assam, Mr. Driberg, Commissioner of Excise, says: "If a man (policeman) does not enter cause, I know by experience that the District Superintendent of Police gets a slip telling him to send a more experienced man, or fine this man for carelessness." The remarks made in 1880 by Dr. Rice, now Surgeon-General with the Government of India, in reference to an unfavourable comment in the Chief Commissioner's review of the report for 1879, may be quoted: "I think it is of doubtful value," he said, "to set down everything told in this way as if it were reasonably true. If these returns are ever to be made use of, it would be better to assign only such alleged causes as have some pretensions to being correct, omitting altogether those which are nothing more than mere conjectures. Even if a great number go unclassified, it is better so than that doubtful causes should be assigned." Asylum statistics quite untrust- worthy. 518. There is one class of cases which seems at first sight to differ from the rest, the cases in which lunatics charged with crime have been acquitted on the ground of insanity. Surgeon-Major McKay, of Nagpur, says: "In criminal cases the cause is general- ly taken from the judgment of the Court." This statement is apparently too strong. The Commission have had to examine the records and papers in the cases of many criminal lunatics. In the majority of cases the Judge is found to be content with the evidence of the Civil Surgeon as to the fact of insanity, and to consider it unnecessary to make any inquiry as to cause. In such cases the information sent to the asylum authorities is precisely of the same character as that furnished in non-criminal cases. It is very rare indeed that any evidence as to cause appears in the evidence tendered in Court, and still more rare for the Judge to discuss the cause. For all practical purposes, the remarks above made regarding the untrustworthy character of the information supplied to the Superintendents, and of the asylum statistics as to cause based thereon, apply to all classes of cases. Dacca Asylum no exception. 519. Although these statistics have been discussed seriously from year to year, they have not been much used as the basis of measures of ganja administration except in the case of Burma. In this case the Commission found that the measures taken 59
234 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XII. in Burma were ostensibly based on the lunatic asylum returns which were quot- ed by more than one Chief Commissioner, special reference being made to the figures for the Dacca Asylum. This special reference to this asylum and the fact that it is situated in the most important ganja-consuming tract in India were among the reasons why the Commission summoned Surgeon- Lieutenant-Colonel Crombie (Bengal witness No. 104) as a witness; for he had been seven years Superintendent of that asylum. Before the Opium Commission also, and in an interesting discussion on opium published as a Supplement to the Indian Medical Gazette of July 1892, Dr. Crombie had incidentally spoken strongly of the evil effects of hemp drugs as seen in his asylum experience. The Commission hoped therefore that Dr. Crombie might be found to have devoted special attention to his asylum work, and to be able to speak with exceptional authority. He informed the Commission in his written evidence that "nearly thirty per cent. of the inmates of lunatic asylums in Bengal are persons who have been ganja smokers, and in a very large pro- portion of these I believe ganja to be the actual and immediate cause of their insanity. But though I am not prepared to say that the moderate use of ganja is never the cause of insanity, it is most frequently the result of long excessive use, and especially of occasional debauches with the drug. It has the same relationship to insanity in India that alcohol has in Europe, and may be the cause of fierce maniacal excitement of short duration (as in delirium tremens) or of a chronic cheerful mania which is the characteristic insanity of Indian asylums. It has not the same tendency to lead to dementia, the result of tissue changes in the brain, as alcohol has. Like alcohol, it will especially lead to in- sanity in persons of deficient self-control who take to the drug as a relief from mental trouble. Both forms of ganja insanity, the acute and chronic, are dis- tinguishable by the symptoms. (See separate memorandum.)" These views, which are stated in greater detail in a separate memorandum, are based entirely on his experience as Superintendent of the Dacca Asylum and as visitor to other asylums; for Dr. Crombie says: "In my practice outside of lunatic asylums my experience is confined to very few cases, only two or three in the whole course of my service, of ganja intoxication brought to hospital." The Commission were anxious to ascertain how far these views might be regarded as having authority. They accordingly examined the registers and case books of the Dacca Asylum for all the years during which Dr. Crombie had been Superintendent, and perused his reports. They were unable to find in these records any ground for thinking that Dr. Crombie's practice differed from that of other Asylum Superintendents, or gave him special opportunities of knowledge. They took the registers for these years and also the papers for all the hemp drug cases of 1887 (Dr. Crombie's last year at Dacca) to Calcutta to discuss them with Dr. Crombie. That discussion is contained in the record of his oral evidence. First, as to procedure, Dr. Crombie told the Commission that the de- scriptive roll is "by no means trustworthy," but that "subsequent discoveries" were made in the asylum by examination of friends or of the lunatic on recovery and by other means, and that the entries in the asylum books would be altered accordingly. "This," he said, "was my practice." The Commission had found no trace of this practice in the asylum records; and they showed Dr.
CH. XII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 235 Crombie the registers and asked him to point out any such alterations. He then withdrew his statement, and accepted as accurate the statement of Rames Chandra Sib, Overseer of the Dacca Asylum, who has made the entries in the registers and compiled Statement No. VII ever since 1880. His statement is: "The cause is entered in the register from the descriptive roll..................... Cause is never entered in the register from enquiry made after the patient's admission. I know of no case of this being done. The entry made at the top of the page would never be altered. But if any enquiry which I might make showed cause not hitherto known, this fact would be entered in the history of the case. I remember such cases, and I might be able to point them out. But that entry in the history of the case would not alter the cause as shown in Statement VII of the annual report. That statement is filled up only from the entries made in the descriptive roll as copied into our register." Dr. Crombie's procedure then differed in no respect from the most mechanical and unintelli- gent record of causation in any asylum in India, for it was left entirely as clerical work to a subordinate. And the only statistics on which Dr. Crombie bases his views regarding insanity rest on the descriptive rolls, of which he strongly declares his distrust. Secondly, in regard to Dr. Crombie's attention to the special matter of causa- tion of insanity, it appears that "there was no discussion of cause in any annual report written by him from Dacca, nor any formal discussion in writing." Like other Superintendents, he seems not to have felt that his duty required special attention to this subject. Thirdly, the Commission discussed with Dr. Crombie the cases of 1887, and the results of this discussion of them are recorded in his oral examina- tion. They afford clear proof of the fact that even a careful examination of the papers received with the lunatics on their admission would have prevented five out of the fourteen cases being recorded as hemp drug cases (viz., the first, fourth, tenth, thirteenth, and probably also the twelfth), and would have led to two more being recorded as mixed or doubtful cases (viz., the second and four- teenth). The history in the asylum should have prevented the fifth case being retained as a ganja case; for the true cause (peripheral irritation) was clearly established, and insanity was cured on removal of that cause. It should also have led to the rejection of the eighth case, or at least to its being recorded as a mixed case. Thus nine out of the fourteen hemp drug cases of 1887 at Dacca are found to have been erroneously entered as such. There remain only five true hemp drug cases. Dr. Crombie says: "Taking my whole asylum expe- rience, I think that this may probably be accepted as fairly representative of the real state of the case." The total admissions in 1887 to the Dacca Asylum were 55. Of these Dr. Crombie now accepts only 5 (or 9 per cent.) as due tohemp drugs. And he states that this may be accepted as fairly representative of the real state of the case, so far as his experience enables him to judge. Fourthly, as to Dr. Crombie's conclusions. As there were fifty-five admis- sions into the asylum in 1887, the number of cases (five) which may reasonably be attributed to ganja turns out to be only nine per cent. As Dr. Crombie says that the "chronic cheerful mania" which he describes is only found in a por- tion (or, as his separate memorandum shows, in a minority) of the admissions, and as he admits that it "may be due in part to difference of character" and not to the drug, there does not seem to be much, if any, ground for associating this chairomania with hemp. And in view of the small proportion of true hemp
236 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XII. drug cases and the large proportion (nearly 2 to 1) of error in the cases accept- ed and recorded as hemp drug cases in Dr. Crombie's time too much weight should not be attached to his views regarding the clinical features of hemp drug insanity. The results of a careful analysis and examination of his cases corresponds on the whole pretty accurately with the examination of the cases of 1892 for all India made by the Commission. Looking back at his work in Dacca from his present point of view, Dr. Crombie seems to have thought that he had had some experience of special value, but the impression appears on examination to be due to a mistake of memory. There is practically nothing that differentiates his experience or the practice of the Dacca Asylum from that of other Superintendents and other asylums in India. Explanation of the use of these worthless statistics. 520. It may well seem extraordinary that statistics based on such absolutely untrustworthy material should have been submitted year after year in the asylum reports. It is extra- ordinary, and cannot certainly be fully justified. The following considerations serve to a certain extent to explain this extraordinary fact. In the first place, as is pointed out by several Superintendents, these officers did not know what grade of police or what kind of agency was employed in the inquiry. They believed that they were bound to accept, and justified in accepting, without question what came to them with an appearance of official authority. In the second place, all the Superintendents, except those in the towns of Madras and Bombay, have their asylum work in addition to other medical duties. They have found themselves unable to devote that amount of time and care to their asylum work which would enable them to speak as experts or to supply infor- mation of any real value. Some of the best of them have stated to the members of the Commission who visited the asylums that they constantly found them- selves subordinating the asylum work to duties which appeared more pressing and more important. In the third place, as already pointed out, they have been so pressed to give statistical information that they have often done so without considering whether it could be regarded as scientifically or even reason- ably accurate. In the fourth place, most of the Superintendents, though they had long practised medicine in this country, had never seen any of the effects of hemp drugs except their alleged effects in producing insanity in the cases attributed in the papers to the drugs. Several Superintendents speak clearly of this ignorance of the effects of the drugs. The remarks of three may be quoted as being specially interesting. Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Leapingwell (Viza- gapatam) says: "I should myself have put down ganja as the cause of insanity in any case where I examined the friends if they merely said the man used ganja and I could get no other cause, as I did not discriminate between the excessive and moderate use. I should go much more carefully into the matter now, since I have in the course of the present inquiry learned so much more about the use of the drugs." Surgeon-Major Cobb, of Dacca, says: "As to the effects of ganja generally, I should say that until I began to study the question with a view to give evidence before the Commission, al- though I had a vague notion that ganja smoking was prevalent among the lower classes in Bengal, I had no idea that the practice was as common as I have since found it to be." Surgeon-Major Willcocks, of Agra, says: "Ordinarily it has been the practice to enter hemp drugs as the cause of insanity where it has been shown that the patient used these drugs. I cannot say precisely why this is the practice. It has come down as the traditional practice. As a matter of fact, until recently I looked on these drugs as very poisonous. As I
CH. XII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 237 have already said, my ordinary medical practice did not bring me into contact with them at all. I only came into contact with them in the asylum. I had no idea that they were used so extensively as I find on enquiry to be the case. I have made enquiry in connection with the attention drawn to the matter recently." These are some of the explanations which may be offered for the submis- sion by Superintendents of such statistics year by year. Further, though such evidence as that of Surgeon-Major-General DeFabeck of Madras shows most clearly how little knowledge some heads of the Medical Department have had of the untrustworthy character of the statistics, it does not show this more clearly than does the mere fact that year after year these statistics have been seriously discussed alike by these officers and by the Governments under whom they serve. Further inquiries made by the Commission. 521. The Commission were forced to the conclusion that there was no trust- worthy basis for a satisfactory and reasonably accurate opinion on the connection between hemp drugs and insanity in the asylum statistics appended to the annual reports. They felt that they must conduct for themselves as full and searching an inquiry as was possible within the time at their disposal into the history of a considerable number of cases. As already stated, they selected as the subject of their inquiry all the cases admitted into all the asylums in India in 1892 and ascribed to hemp drugs. They took up each of these cases separately in the asylum, and ascertained what information was obtainable in regard to it from perusal of the original papers and the asylum registers, and also by enquiry from the Superintendent and Asylum officials. Having recorded all such informa- tion, they asked the Superintendent of each asylum to conduct further inquiry into each case and report finally on it, and they requested Local Governments to direct the Magistrates and Civil Surgeons of districts to which the patients belong to give the Superintendent all necessary assistance. The Commission added: "In view of the importance of this branch of the inquiry, it is sug- gested that, wherever this is possible, a careful local inquiry should be con- ducted by a trustworthy and experienced Magistrate, in consultation with the Civil Surgeon, to ascertain the past personal and family history of the patient, and any circumstances likely to throw light on the cause of his insanity. The record of this inquiry should in each case be submitted to the Commission through the Superintendent of the asylum in which the patient was treated to enable him to submit the report above mentioned." All this information, both that collected in the asylums and that collected in these further inquiries, is recorded in Vol. II Appendices. Only the final report of the Superintendent is printed, unless it is inaccurate or incomplete, or unless there is anything of interest in the records which he has not noticed. In these cases notes contain- ing the points omitted or inaccurately stated, or extracts from the records, are appended to his report. Prefixed to these papers is a statement of the decision of the Commission on all of the cases, showing very briefly for each why it has been accepted or rejected. In a few cases the results of the inquiries are unsatisfactory; for it has been impossible occasionally to get any further information; and occasionally the inquiry, even though feasible, has not been conducted with sufficient care and intelligence. On the whole, how- ever, the result is the collection of a body of information about these selected cases far superior to anything heretofore available. 60
238 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XII. The result of the examination of all the cases attributed to hemp drugs in 1892 may be thus shown:CH. XII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 239 Out of 1,344 admissions to the asylums of British India during 1892, there are shown to be only 98 cases (or 7.3 per cent.) in which the use of hemp drugs may be reasonably regarded as a factor in causing the insanity. If the "mixed" cases in which the hemp drugs have only been accepted as one of several possible causes are omitted, the percentage falls to 4.5. It must be borne in mind, however, that there were 42 per cent. of the admissions for 1892 in which the cause of insanity was shown as "unknown." Among these "un- known" cases there may, no doubt, have been some in which hemp drugs may, as in the accepted cases, have played some part in causing insanity. If it had been possible to ascertain the history of these "unknown" cases, it might have been found that there was in a considerable number of them a history of the use of hemp drugs, and perhaps that in some of them these drugs had played some part at least in causing the insanity. It might appear at first sight to be more correct to take the percentage, not on the total admissions into the asylums, but on the "known" cases among these admissions. The total number of "known" cases (i. e., cases in which the cause was supposed to be known) among the admissions for 1892 was 775. This would give a percentage of hemp drug cases at 12.6. But the Commission do not see their way to accept this method of cal- culation as accurate. For they consider that both experience and the whole his- tory of this inquiry have shown that there is little difficulty in ascertaining the existence of the ganja habit among persons such as are sent to the asylums, and also that there is no hesitation in ascribing insanity to that habit. They are therefore of opinion that it is safe to presume that in the great majority of the "unknown" cases no ganja habit did exist, and that they would be further from the truth in taking the percentage at 12.6 than at 7.3. Mixed cases. 522. On the other hand, it would be far from accurate to say that it has been ascertained that the insanity was in all these 98 cases due solely to hemp drugs. In the first place, there are 37 of them (or nearly 38 per cent.) in which there is a clear history of some other cause. The causes which are shown thus to have possibly co-oper- ated with hemp drugs in inducing insanity (with the number of causes for each) are as follow:240 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XII. Hack Tuke's Dictionary of Psychological Medicine; article "Statistics of In- sanity"). The author of this article points out that "the reluctance of the relatives of patients to give information on this painful point leaves the propor- tion undoubtedly far too low." In view of this, it cannot be denied that the influence of heredity is in India practically neglected. The importance of giving due weight to this factor becomes the more manifest when it is considered that a cause which in a normally healthy brain would produce no effect is suffi- cient to overthrow the mental equilibrium of a person with hereditary predis- position. Alcohol. 524. There are eighteen of these mixed cases in which alcohol has been ascer- tained to be a possible factor. In view of the con- nection between alcohol and insanity as established in Europe, and in view of the clear evidence that brain lesions are directly caused by alcohol, there seems certainly not less reason for ascribing these cases to alcohol than to hemp drugs. The English statistics show percentages of 19.8 and 7.2 of cases as due to alcohol for males and females respectively. The Commission are of opinion that such high percentages cannot be expected in India; for, although the action of alcohol is more injurious in the tropics, the people of this country are generally much more abstemious. The percentage of cases attributed to alcohol in each province in 1892 is given below, and for purposes of comparison the percentage of the accepted hemp drug cases (in- cluding the "mixed" cases) is also shown:CH. XII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 241 Dhatura. 525. There are three "mixed" cases in which dhatura has been-ascertained to be a possible cause of insanity. In view of the facts that dhatura is a more potent intoxicant than the hemp drugs and produces furious delirium, and that Dr. Cunningham's experiments appear to indicate clearly that grave cerebral lesions are very early produced by dhatura and are not produced by ganja, it would probably be safer to accept these cases as due to dhatura and not to hemp drugs. The Commis- sion have, however, accepted them as "mixed" cases. It is unnecessary to make any special remarks on the "mixed" cases in which causes other than heredity, alcohol, and dhatura appear to contribute to the insanity. Cases due to hemp drugs. 526. Even in regard to the remaining 61 cases, it must be borne in mind that it is impossible to say that the use of hemp drugs was in all the sole cause of insanity, or indeed any part of the cause. The following considerations combine to demand caution and reserve in pronouncing an opinion on this point. Firstly, there are twelve cases in which it has been found impossible to obtain any further information by local inquiry. In these cases we are thrown back on the original papers and the asylum history. Besides these, there are ten more cases in which the patients are beggars and foreign labourers about whose past history no satisfactory information is obtainable. Thus there remain only 39 of these 61 cases about which anything like a satisfactory inquiry has been possible. Further, a great majority of these cases come from the lower orders of cultivators and labourers, from whom information of any value is very difficult to obtain as to other than the most apparent causes. The fact of the existence of the hemp habit is easy enough to ascertain, but that it is the cause, or one of the causes of the insanity, or that it even preceded the insanity, is much more difficult to establish. Secondly, the method of inquiry has not been satisfactory in regard to all the cases referred for local inquiry. In regard to the great majority, the instruc- tions issued by the Commission as to the agency by which this further inquiry should be conducted have been carried out. But in some, it will be observed, even this further inquiry has been left to the police. Then again there are cases, such as those of the Hyderabad (Sind) Asylum, in which the Superintendent has necessarily been the principal agent in the inquiry, and has, perhaps, not unnatur- ally, but certainly unfortunately, evinced a strong tendency to defend the old asylum entries regarding cause. The series of questions framed by the Civil Surgeon of Delhi for use in the further inquiry also illustrates a tendency to assume that the cases were hemp drug cases, and thus to limit the scope of the inquiry. Thirdly, it may be noted that excess in the use of hemp drugs is very fre- quently only one of several vices in which a dissipated man indulges. Further inquiry has proved this in several cases. There is strong probability that had information been complete, it would have been established in many more cases. It is impossible in such cases to say definitely to what form of excess insanity may be mainly due. Further, it is an accepted and established fact that intemperance of any kind may sometimes be not the cause of insanity, but an early manifestation of mental instability. Dr. Conolly Norman (Hack Tuke's Dictionary of Psycho- 61
242 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XII. logical Medicine; article "Mania") says: "The patient also indulges in intoxicants with very undue or unwonted freedom, and thereby precipitates the course and aggravates the symptoms of his disease." One or two cases have been rejected by the Commission on the ground that the evidence merely showed that the habit of use of hemp began at the same time as the mental aberration, or even later. There may have been other cases in which this would have been shown had the information been complete. It is possible therefore that more complete informa- tion might have shown in some cases, not only that other causes contributed to the insanity, but also that hemp drugs had nothing whatever to do with inducing it. These and similar considerations already indicated demand caution in the expression of any judgment as to the causation of insanity in this country. If in England opinion, based on inquiries such as are there possible, has to be stated with caution, this is much more necessary here. In many of the cases in which the hemp drug habit has been established, it is impossible to feel certain in view of the defective character of the information that the drugs have been the sole cause, or perhaps indeed a cause at all, of the insanity. The Com- mission have, however, felt themselves justified in accepting these 98 cases of the year 1892 as reasonably attributable, in whole or in part, to the use of hemp drugs. These are the best cases they have been able within the time at their disposal to obtain. Of these 98 cases, 97 were males and one female, 82 being Hindus and 16 Muhammadans.

The following table shows the relative liability to insanity at different ages in the hemp drugs cases. This information has been compiled solely from the "descriptive rolls," and in very many instances thea ges entered are doubtless only rough guesses. At all times it is difficult to ascertain the true age of a native of the lower classes, and in the case of wandering insanes, beggars, etc., the determination of age must necessarily be inexact and a mere approximation:244.

Regarding the cases described as "not cured," it is necessary to explain that the expression is to be taken only relatively for the period during which the patients were under observation by the Commission, and which as a general rule would be under two years. The duration of residence in asylums of the 50 patients discharged during the period mentioned may be tabulated as follows:CH.

[CH. XII. In 17 out of 98 cases only is information recorded as to the nature of the onset of the symptoms; in eight it may be described "sudden;" in six as "gradual" or "slow"; and in three as "insidious." As a rule no detailed in- formation is ascertainable regarding the nature of the premonitory symptoms or their duration. "Headache" has been mentioned, but beyond that there are no clinical symptoms. Sometimes alteration in habit is alluded to, but more frequently attention has first been drawn to the mental condition by some insane, violent, or destructive act which has led to the individual being sent to a medical officer for observation. Regarding the state of the general bodily health on admission into asylums, in 35 cases it is described as "good," in 20 "fair," in 8 "indifferent," in 6 "bad," in 3 "weak" or "very weak," and in the remaining cases no information is recorded. As a rule no records are kept of the form or measurements of the head, general physical features are not recorded, and thermometrical observations do not usually appear to be made. The facial expression is as a rule not described, and in three instances only is it referred to as "vacant." The appearance of a "ganja wart" on the palm is mentioned by one Superintendent. The gait is as a rule not described. Abnormalities or signs of disease of the sexual organs are not usually mentioned. The condition of the circulatory and respiratory systems are not as a rule recorded. Under the digestive system it may be mentioned that in fifteen cases food was refused, necessitating forcible feeding. No informa- tion as a rule is available regarding the glandular system, state of the skin, or character of the urine.

To enable me to do so clearly, it is necessary to distinguish between acute ganja intoxication due to a single debauch or to continuous excessive use of it in what might be called a bout of ganja drunkenness, and the effects of its continued immoderate use over a lengthened period of time. Acute ganja intoxication is marked by the extreme vehemence of the mania. In its mental, moral, and muscular manifestations, it bears no resemblance to alcoholic intoxication whatever. The maniac is excited in every fibre. His aspect is infuriated, his eye glares and is tense and glistening, while at the same time the conjunctiva is red and injected. He shouts, vocifer- ates, sings, walks quickly up and down or round his cell, and shakes the door out of its fastenings. If at liberty, he is violent and aggressive, and may run amok. In other cases the mental disturbance is less marked, but the demeanour is excited, and he suddenly seizes some weapon, and slays one or more of the people in his neighbourhood without apparent reason. The attack is of short duration, being limited to a few days. Then there is perfect recovery, and the patient is oblivious of things which took place during the period of intoxication............The insanity produced by the long-continued immoderate use of ganja has also features of its own. The patients are hilarious, attitudinise, and are full of the sense of well- being; they are as a rule good-natured and trustworthy, and recover in a large proportion of cases under confinement and deprivation of the drug. These cases characterize Indian asylums by the large number of happy amusing lunatics they contain. They are, however, very subject to relapses even after lengthened periods of freedom from symptoms." The alleged shorter duration of hemp drug cases is to some extent borne out by the statistics obtained by comparing the accepted and rejected cases for 1892. In the accepted cases (98), after deducting the ten patients who were not insane on admission, the percentage of recoveries has amounted to 56.8 per cent. of the total admissions, while of the rejected cases only 32.4 per cent. of the admissions have recovered. The Commission consider, however, that too much stress should not be placed upon rapidity of recovery as a diagnostic sign in attempting to differentiate between hemp drug and ordinary mania. It is well recognized that as a rule ordinary uncomplicated cases of mania rapidly recover. Moreover, bearing in mind that hitherto hemp drug cases have been accepted as such as a rule on untrustworthy evidence, and that consequently many of the cases on which Superintendents of Asylums have based an opinion as to the relative rapidity of cure of hemp drug and ordinary mania were not actually toxic cases, "rapidity of recovery" can only be accepted tentatively as a means of discrimination. It is scarcely necessary to observe that this so called "diagnostic mark" has not been used in diagnosing hemp drug insanity in the asylums, as it has been shown that diagnosis was made on the admission of the patient and not after his recovery. In connection with the alleged greater recoverability of cases of hemp drug mania, it may be of interest to quote statistics of cases in an English asylum. In the West Riding Asylum the percentage of recoveries in acute and simple mania were respectively 65.5 and 61 per cent., while 8.4 and 11.9 per cent. were relieved and 11.9 and 16 per cent. formed a chronic residue. Taking all maniacal forms in the same asylum (including the simple, acute, hysteric, chronic,

XII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 249 delusional, recurrent, and puerperal), the recoveries amounted to 53.2 per cent.: 14 per cent. were relieved, and 20.6 per cent. formed a chronic remainder. Obvi- ously, however, these figures are not strictly comparable with the statistics of the hemp drugs and rejected cases with which the Commission have been deal- ing, because the Indian cases have only been a limited period under observation250 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XII. The determination of cause depends wholly upon history. The Commission also consider it not improbable that there are no typical brain lesions peculiar to hemp drug insanity, though definite lesions are doubtless present in chronic cases, as they are in cases due to other causes. In answering the question, therefore, on what the evidence rests that hemp drugs may induce mental aberration, the Commission would offer the following remarks: The evidence may be considered under two headsCH. XII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 251 series of experiments on monkeys. A full account of the experiment with ganja is given in paragraph 483. Dr. Cunningham reports on naked-eye inspection that "the cerebro-spinal nervous centres were all apparently perfectly healthy." The results of the histological examination are not before the Commission, but it is hoped that they will be received in time to be included in the appendix. So far as the information from all sources before the Commission is concerned, there is no evidence of any brain lesions being directly caused by hemp drugs, as they have been found to be caused by alcohol and dhatura; and there is evidence that the coarse brain lesions produced by alcohol and dhatura are not produced by hemp drugs. Cerebral stimulants. 537. The precise physiological effects induced by the inhalation of the products of the destructive distillation of hemp resin and those arising from the exhibition of the resin by the stomach are probably not identical, but in both cases there is ample evidence that the use of the drug in either form may first cause cerebral stimulation, and then depress the functional activity of the brain. Franois Franck and Pitre's experiments (Arch. de Physiol., 1883), quoted by Lauder Brunton, indicate that in the case of dogs the excitability of the brain is increased by the administration of Cannabis, a purified form of hemp resin, so that the tendency to epileptic convulsions is greatly increased, and may be induced by very much slighter stimuli than usual. Alcohol is a typical cerebral stimulant, and any drug which, like alcohol, increases the functional activity of the brain, may, like alcohol, give rise to what is technically known as "an intoxication." The effect of alcohol may result in three principal sets of symptoms, which are admirably se tforth by Legrain (Dictionary of Psychological Medicine). (a) Taken in large amounts, in a short time it produces acute symptoms, which are immediate, but temporary252 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XII. (c)Cases in which the drug has been used for a considerable period, and then given rise to mania of shorter or longer duration, or cases in which the symptoms of hemp drug delirium do not completely subside, but pass on into a state of mania usually curable, and thus indicating the probable absence of anatomical lesionsCH. XII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 253 re-action of the cerebrum, which is arrested in its full and regular function, and the coming into play of the cellular elements under the influence of an external and abnormal excitation which is different from the usual stimulation. As already pointed out, this excitation may affect one part of the brain more than another; hence the apparent difference in the symptoms, which may also vary in different individuals, although they are under the influence of the same poison. The toxic substance does not add any new element to those which the normal brain possesses, and herein lies the great difference between the superadded insanity and the insanity which the brain produces itself between toxic derangement and psychosis. All or nearly all slight intoxications, from whatever cause, are characterised by certain general symptoms254 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XII. but, generally speaking, the acute stage, if recovery should follow, does not last more than a few days or weeks. In chronic voluntary intoxication the cause of the symptoms depends necessarily on the habits of the patient and the indi- vidual re-action. The chronic period does not generally establish itself from the first. There are first the acute phenomena, which may reproduce themselves a number of times, without, however, preventing chronicity from establishing itself: these acute symptoms are nothing but epiphenomena, which appear again and again in the course of this period: the two essential kinds of symptoms, how- ever, are the irresistible appetite for the poison, with periodical return of the acute and sub-acute symptoms, and the progressive decay of the mental faculties. The acute symptoms correspond to the temporary saturation of the body with the poison, while the chronic symptoms are the expression of definite anatomical lesions in the brain gradually developed under toxic influence. The prolonged use of mind poisons thus gives rise to progressive weakening of all the facul- ties passing over into dementia. Acute toxic insanity is a secondary insanity: it is polymorphous; all forms of insanity may be observed, not only in two differ- ent intoxications, but even in the course of one and the same intoxication. It is temporary, nothing but a momentary acute effervescence terminating with the elimination of the poison. Intoxication and insanity. 539. Before leaving the subject of insanity, there is one point to which it seems desirable briefly to allude. The impression left on the minds of the Commission by the perusal of a large number of records in criminal cases and by the examination of some asy- lum cases is that there is occasionally seen a tendency to confound intoxication and insanity in connection with hemp drugs. The result is that in some cases men who should have been simply punished for being intoxicated have been sent to the asylum, and, though sane when they reached that institution, have been detained there. These cases are, however, much rarer than they used to be, if one may judge from the old asylum reports. A more serious result of this con- fusion is that there are cases in which men who have committed offences, espe- cially crimes of violence, under the influence of hemp drugs have been acquitted on the ground of insanity, although the circumstances have been such that had the intoxicant been alcohol, they would have been convicted. It is undoubtedly more difficult in the case of ganja than in the case of alcohol to recognize the line drawn for social and legal purposes between intoxication and insanity. But the difficulty is not insuperable. The main reason for the confusion that has existed is probably the ignorance that has prevailed regarding hemp drugs. When they are recognised as a common intoxicant, it is to be hoped that the practice of the Courts will be freed from the occasional blemishes above indicated. It is not expedient, nor is it just, that intoxication from hemp drugs should secure immunity from punishment which is not allowed to alcohol; and, on the other hand, the Commission cannot concur with Dr. Walsh (Bengal witness No. 112) when he says: "It is not my opinion from experience that it is either dreadful in itself or possibly disastrous to a man's mind to have to herd for years with lunatics, though sane."
CHAPTER XIII. EFFECTS-MORAL: GENERAL SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS. Social effects. 540. Hitherto the effects of hemp drugs have been considered principally with reference to consumers themselves. In turning now to the discussion of their moral effects, we shall practically consider briefly their direct effects on society. Are consu- mers offensive to their neighbours, and is there any connection between hemp drugs and crime? These are the questions which it is proposed now to discuss. A considerable mass of evidence has been collected on these questions. Are consumers offensive to their neighbours? 541. As to whether moderate consumers are offensive to their neighbours the evidence can leave little doubt on the mind of any one who peruses it carefully. About seven hundred witnesses have thought it worth while to speak on this point. It may be safely presumed that of the remainder the great majority have no experience of any- thing offensive in consumers. Of those who have given their opinions, over six hundred say that moderate consumers are not offensive to their neighbours. Of the small minority, some object, not unnaturally, to the bad example they think their ganja smoking neighbour may be to their sons who are growing up. Some merely take offence at the smell of the ganja smoke, and some at the "coughing and expectorating." They are evidently not inclined to be tolerant of the indulgence which they do not care themselves to practise. On the other hand, some of the minority are clearly dealing not with moderate consumption, but with the worst type of excess. They speak vaguely of the consumers as committing the gravest crimes under the influence of these drugs. Altogether it is clear that the moderate consumer is as a rule perfectly inoffensive. There appear to be quite adequate grounds for accepting the statement of those who assert that as a rule he "cannot be distinguished from the total abstainer." Some witnesses have stated that they had difficulty in finding the moderate con- sumers, though they did find that the habit of moderate consumption is common. Indeed, there are not wanting those who say that no consumer of bhang or ganja, whether in moderation or in excess, is ever an offensive neighbour. The contrast in this respect between the excessive consumer of hemp drugs and the excessive consumer of alcohol is frequently emphasized. No doubt the excessive consumer of hemp drugs must sometimes be a disagreeable and perhaps even dangerous neighbour; but even among excessive consumers such cases seem to be very rare indeed. Connection of hemp drugs with crime. 542. In discussing the connection of hemp drugs with crime, it is necessary to discriminate between any effect which they may be supposed to produce on crime in general and the unpremeditated crimes of violence to which intoxication may give rise. Thus there are those who allege that the habitual use of alcohol, at all events if carried to excess, degrades the mind and character of the consumer and predisposes him to crime in general, or to crimes of a particular character, especially to offences against property. Drink is thus set down sometimes as one of the most efficient agencies for increasing the criminal classes. On the other hand, there are well known cases in which intoxication from alcohol has led to crimes of an occasional and exceptional character, generally to unpremeditated crimes of
256 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XIII. violence or other unpremeditated offences against the person. These two classes of cases should be carefully distinguished and treated separately. Bad characters. 543. The first question then is whether any large proportion of bad characters are habitual consumers of hemp drugs, and whether there is any general connection between such con- sumption and crime. About one-half of the witnesses have dealt with this ques- tion. Of these, a majority of two to one hold that no large proportion of bad char- acters are moderate consumers. A majority, but not quite so large, have the same opinion regarding excessive consumers. In respect to the second part of the question, a majority of eight to one hnld that moderate consumption of these drugs has no connection with crime in general or with crimes of any particular character. A majority of nearly four to one hold the same view in regard to excessive consumption. There is one witness who makes rather a suggestive observation in this connection. He says that consumers "are called badmashes for this reason only, that our children may fear them and avoid their company." This undoubtedly suggests an explanation of some part of the popular condemnation of the drugs. A very large proportion of the natives of this country have a strong aversion to the use of intoxicants, and may reasonably be expected to influence their children against them in precisely this way. This may lead some witnesses to take an exaggerated view of the number of bad characters who are consumers. But there need be no hesitation in accepting the view that this number is indeed larger in proportion than the number of consumers among the general population. Consumers of hemp drugs are found more among the lower orders, among the poor, than among the more wealthy. The former are, of course, the classes to which the badmashes or bad characters belong. This is the explanation given by many witnesses of the alleged fact that proportionately more consumers of hemp drugs, and especially ganja smokers, are to be found among bad characters than among the whole population. But the general opinion is that hemp drugs have per se no necessary connection with crime. It is true that some witnesses assert that habitual consumers sometimes spend more than their poverty renders reasonably possible, and are then tempt- ed to commit petty thefts. And there are probably many Magistrates of experience who have in "bad livelihood cases" heard the police enlarge on the amount believed to be spent on hemp drugs and other intoxicants and the appa- rent impossibility of meeting this expenditure honestly. The same is true, how- ever, of any unwise expenditure beyond what one can afford, and of any extra- vagance which intensifies poverty. Do criminals fortify themselves with these drugs? 544. Another question which arises in reference to the connection between hemp drugs and crime is whether these drugs are to any considerable extent taken by criminals to fortify themselves to commit premeditated crime of any kind. About one-half of the witnesses speak on this point. Of these a majority of nine to four answer in the negative. The truth seems to be that as hemp drugs help the consumer to endure great fatigue or exposure and stimulate him to unwonted exertion, criminals, like any other consumers of these drugs, go to them for that assistance when they feel that they require it. This is just as any man under similar circumstances might go to the intoxicant he was in the habit of using. Sometimes, no doubt, also a criminal may take his own particular
CH. XIII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 257 intoxicant to supply Dutch courage. But it seems just as common with him to desire to keep his head clear, and therefore to avoid all intoxicants. No man, of course, who was not unaccustomed to the use of hemp drugs would turn to them for any of these purposes. There would be too great a risk of the unaccustomed intoxicant disabling rather than nerving the man. There is one class frequently mentioned in some parts of the country by whom the drugs are no doubt used, viz., "lathials" or professional clubmen, who are employed occasionally as mer- cenaries in riots and assaults. These men, like many wrestlers, use the drug habitually, and no doubt indulge in it before going out on their work. Do criminals administer them totheir victims? 545. About the same number of witnesses deal with the question whether criminals use hemp drugs to stupefy their victims. By a majority of about three to two, they answer this question in the affirmative. The question arises whether complete or sufficient stupefaction can be induced by the administration of these drugs. There seems to be considerable doubt on this point. It is a very general opinion that only persons unaccustomed to the drugs could be ren- dered insensible by them, and such persons would not take the drugs. No doubt ganja might be administered in a chillum with the pretence that there was no- thing there but the tobacco with which it was mixed. But this as a rule would involve too much risk. Ganja would be too readily detected by smell and flavour. Many even of those who believe that hemp drugs could produce sufficient stupe- faction speak also to the admixture as a general rule of more potent drugs, such as dhatura. As to cases, it is far easier to get many established cases of such stu- pefaction by dhatura alone than to get one where hemp drugs were clearly the narcotic employed. There are two special instances of this kind of use of hemp drugs mentioned by some witnesses, viz., thefts of ornaments from prostitutes intoxicated with bhang, and thefts of ornaments from children stupefied by majum sweetmeats. These, however, do not appear to be common. It is difficult to get instances of any such use of these drugs. The evidence in support of the view that they are so used is largely hearsay and based on mere rumour. On the whole, it is very improbable that the drugs are much used in this way; for dhatura, a much more potent drug, is more easily available and more easily administered. Evidence that excessive consump-tion is not connected with unpre- meditated crimes, especially crimes of violence. 546. There seems, therefore, good reason for believing that the connection bet- ween hemp drugs and ordinary crime is very slight indeed. There remains for discussion their alleged connection with unpremeditated crime, especially crimes of violence. In this connection it seemed only necessary to consider the excessive use of the drugs. This, then, was the question put before the witness- es, whether excessive indulgence in any of these drugs incites to unpremeditated crime, and whether they knew cases in which it had led to temporary homicidal frenzy. This question has been discussed by nearly six hundred witnesses, of whom a majority of very nearly three to two answer in the negative. They do not believe in any such connection. Their experience has not brought before them cases in which that connection seemed to exist. Some of them have clear recollection of crime being associated by causation with alcohol, but can- not recall any case in which it was similarly associated with hemp drugs. They will not go beyond their experience, and therefore they answer in the negative. 65
258 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XIII. Some of them go further than this. They go so far as to say that these drugs not only do not incite to crime, but have the very opposite tendency. They are of opinion that the drugs "tend to make men quiet;" that "the immediate effect is stupefying; there is none of that tendency to violence which is acharacteristic of alcoholic intoxication;" and that the result of continued abuse of the drugs is to make a man "timid and unlikely to commit crime." These last statements cannot be accepted as generally true. No doubt the drugs may sometimes have these sedative effects, though a number of witnesses speak to habitual use producing irritability. Any one who has extensively visited ganja shops or places where consumers congregate must be struck with the perfect quiet which prevails in the great majority, and with the slothful, easy attitude of the consumers. These are not, however, the invariable effects of hemp drugs. Undoubtedly the excessive use does in some cases make the consumer violent. It is probably safe to say in view of all the evidence that the tendency of the drugs often seems to be to develop or bring into play the natural disposition of the consumer, to emphasize his characteristic peculiarities, or to assist him in obtaining what he sets his mind on. If he aims at ease and rest and is let alone, he will be quiet and restful; but if he is naturally excitable and ill-tempered, or if he is disturbed and crossed, he may be violent. This may be accepted perhaps as generally true if allowance be specially made for the fact that excess in the use of these drugs tends to show and to develop inherent weakness of character. At the same time the fact that so many witnesses testify to the peaceable and orderly character of the excessive con- sumers goes far to prove that in this country experience shows that as a rule these drugs do not tend to crime and violence. Evidence to the contrary. 547. This impression is intensified by the consideration of the statements made by some of the witnesses who constitute the minority. Mr. D. R. Lyall (Bengal witness No. 1), who has had thirty-two years' varied experience as a Revenue Officer and Magis- trate, says: "I have known cases of temporary homicidal frenzy;" but in his oral examination he says: "I can give no examples to illustrate my answer." This is precisely the position occupied by many of the most experienced witnesses. They have a more or less vague impression that hemp drugs and violent crime have been occasionally associated, but they cannot recall cases. A few testify to having searched the criminal records or police reports for years back in vain. As Mr. Westmacott (Bengal witness No. 2) says in his written paper: "I do not at this moment remember a case, but I have an im- pression that there are such cases." This is a witness typical of a class. There are other witnesses who speak less cautiously of "many cases," but cannot give information about any. Thus Mr. Williams (Bengal witness No. 18) speaks of "innumerable cases of homicidal frenzy." But his remark "is merely based on newspapers;" and he knows only one case which occurred atCalcutta while he was at Darbhanga, and of which his knowledge is "entirely hearsay." Similarly, Mr. W. C. Taylor (Bengal witness No. 36), an uncove- nanted officer of forty-seven years' experience, speaks of "numerous cases," but can only recall oneCH. XIII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 259 states that "running amok is always the result of excessive indulgence" in hemp drugs; but under cross-examination he says: "I have never had experience of such a case. I only state what I have heard." These witnesses also are typi- cal of a considerable class, who refer to hearsay, to rumour, and to newspapers as the basis of their opinion. Many others, like Mr. Cooke, Commissioner of Orissa (Bengal witness No. 8), base their opinion on what they have heard of the history of criminal lunatics in asylums, and really speak only of acts of violence due to mania. One witness exposes this fallacy very simply: "I have never seen any instance of unpreme- ditated crime committed by a consumer, except that mad men sometimes grow violent." Such cases are clearly irrelevant to the question immediately under discussion. But there are a good number of witnesses who thus confound cases of violence occurring in the course of established insanity with unpremeditated crime incited by drugs. Instances are thus given of acts of violence committed in the asylum where the lunatic is confined. Some witnesses are even content to quote the fact of mania characterized by violence without any particular offence being committed as establishing this alleged connection between hemp drugs and violent crime. Some witnesses again base their opinion on a purely casual connection between the use of the drugs and the commission of crime. Thus Mr. Hugh Fraser (North-Western Provinces witness No. 8) spoke in his written paper of many crimes "committed under the influence of ganja." In his oral examination he asked that the word "while" should be inserted; and added: "I do not attri- bute the crime to the consumption of the drug. I cannot recall the details of any of these cases." This is certainly very different from the impression which his written answer conveyed. A Bengal witness goes even further in this direction. He says: "I know of two cases in which two ganja smokers com- mitted murders, one for gain, and the other in heat of provocation." There is another class of witnesses who do not profess at all to require any basis of fact for their opinion. They speculate on the probabilities. They are content to reply that hemp drugs "weaken the brain and may lead to crime," or "I can imagine their doing so in the same way as excess of alcohol in an indivi- dual of a naturally violent temperament, but not in a peaceful subject." Cases referred to. 548. All this tends greatly to lessen the weight of the evidence in support of the affirmative answer to this question, and to streng- then the impression that it is but rarely that exces- sive indulgence in hemp drugs can be credited with inciting to crime or leading to homicidal frenzy. All witnesses have been asked whether they know of cases of homicidal frenzy. The cases quoted are, however, very few. They have all been carefully considered by the Commission. As already stated, a few witness- es have mentioned cases which are admittedly mere outbreaks of established insanity. These cases are excluded. Two Punjab cases mentioned by Colonel Tucker (witness No. 28) and Mr. C. Brown (witness No. 29), in which Ghazis and Kukas are stated merely to have fortified themselves by bhang for a fanati- cal attack on their enemies, have also been excluded. Finally, four cases which occurred beyond British territory in feudatory states have also been excluded. With these exceptions, all the cases mentioned by witnesses answering question 53 have been abstracted and compiled in a tabular form in Vol. III Appendices.
260 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XIII. They are divided into two classesCH.

The principal circumstances of the case and the real provocation are lost sight of by the witness. This case cannot be regarded as due to hemp drugs. This witness, second case (No. 60), is defective in a somewhat similar manner, inasmuch as he fails to point out that the man sought to murder his wife because she had given evidence against him. This is unfortunately too often found to be an adequate explanation of such a crime as this. Though the man was a ganja smoker, there is no proof that he was under the influence of the drug at the time. There is no mention of ganja in the record. The next witness is Dr. Crombie, who is a member of the Committee for advising Government about criminal lunatics. He stated that he was unable, how- ever, to give specific cases, but had one case clearly in his mind. This case he had also quoted before the Opium Commission as a case of running amok from ganja. He stated the case thus: "A Bengali babu, as the result of a single debauch, in an attack of ganja mania slew seven of his nearest relatives in bed during the night." A perusal of the records indicates that this statement of the case is wholly inaccurate. There is indeed mention of the man having used both ganja and opium. But there is no mention of a debauch, and there is mention of habit. So that the conception of "a single debauch" is quite opposed to the history contained in the records. The judicial record shows that the man had been for years peculiar in his behaviour; that about six years before he had be- come quite mad for a time on his wife's death; that on the present occasion a similar outbreak of madness had occurred on his mother's death; that he "did not take ganja during this time;" that the murders were committed on the night of his mother's Shradh, about which there had been "a commotion" during the day; and that the motive seemed to be mere insane despair as to how these members of the family could be cared for in the future. The asylum papers indeed mention "his mother's death as well as addiction to ganja and opium" as the cause of insanity. But the papers afford no clue as to the origin of Dr. Crombie's view of the case. The next five cases are three mentioned by Mr. Marindin (Collector, Bengal) and two by Mr. Dalrymple Clark (District Superintendent of Police, Assam). These witnesses did not profess a detailed knowledge of these cases, but merely suggested that the records should be consulted as the cases seemed to be such as the Commission desired to see. But the records show that no satisfactory connection between hemp drugs and crime was established in any of these cases. Dr. Mullane, a Civil Surgeon in Assam, mentions two cases in which he thinks the crime was associated with ganja. The first (No. 67) is a case in which a religious mendicant murdered a guest in the middle of the night. Under these circumstances it is impossible to say with anything like confidence what really occurred. But the evidence does point to the crime having been committed under the influence of ganja. In his second case (No. 68), however, Dr. Mullane is incorrect in his facts. The man did wound some people; he appa- rently did not kill any one. He never took ganja, though he took liquor and opium. The Judge found that he was not under the influence of any intoxicant at the time of the offence. Mr. Moran, an Assam Tea Planter, gives the next case (No. 69). It is instructive to note that though the case occurred on his own estate, and he was 66
262 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XIII. a witness at the trial, Mr. Moran's memory does not serve him well in regard to the facts. His present account of it differs most materially from that given at the time. The record is clearly against any connection between the crime and ganja, which Mr. Moran did not then mention at all. The only remaining Assam case (No. 70) seems from the papers to have been clearly a liquor case, and in no way connected with hemp drugs. The two Punjab cases seem both to illustrate the connection between hemp drugs and crime. The first (No. 71) has been already quoted as indicating the character of the fakirs to whom so many of these cases of violent crime are attributed. The second (No. 72) is a very interesting case. The records show- ing the efforts which have been made by the Punjab Government to make the Khosa tribe give up the excessive use of intoxicants well repay perusal. If these tribesmen can be persuaded to see the evil effects which have resulted from this excess and to abjure the drugs they use without turning to others, the Govern- ment will deserve congratulations on the results of a somewhat exceptional line of action. The next case (No. 73) is given by Colonel Chrystie, a Deputy Inspector- General of Police in Madras, and is referred to by several other witnesses. A peon having been fined is said in his irritation to have taken a considerable amount of ganja, and to have then rushed out with a club. He struck a boy, and then ran along the public road until he met an old man whom he beat to death, alleging afterwards that he had killed a black pig. The connection be- tween the crime and ganja was accepted by the courts at the time; but doubt is cast on this case by the fact that this man was afterwards found to be subject to recurrent insanity, several violent outbreaks of which were manifestly independent of any drug. This is one of the accepted cases for 1892 in the Madras Asylum. The next three cases (Nos. 74 to 76) were referred to by Mr. Stokes, a Madras Collector, as having been mentioned to him by a Police Inspector as ganja cases. But a perusal of the records shows that there is no adequate reason for connecting these murders with hemp drugs. The last Madras case (No. 77) is a strange one. A father first cruelly burned his child; and, when the child cried, it occurred to the father as it was a feast day to offer the child to the god. He did so, killing the child and lapping up the blood. There was evidence that the man was under the influence of ganja (bhang) which he had smoked. The High Court adopted this view and sentenced him to trans- portation for life. The next case (No. 78) is one in which certain Talavias organized a riot in the town of Broach, in the course of which Mr. Prescott, District Superintendent of Police, was killed. Mr. Cappel, the Collector, gives a full account of the details of this disturbance, and shows that it cannot be reasonably connected with hemp drugs. The next two cases were mentioned by Mr. Sinclair, Collector of Thana. The first (No. 79) is the case of a servant who is alleged to have attempted to throttle his master's wife as she was sleeping by her husband at night. He is said to have been under the influence of ganja, and the records bear out this

CH. XIII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 263 view. In the second case (No. 80), Mr. Sinclair seems to be doubly mistaken. In the first place, the Magistrate acquitted the accused because it was not proved that he had committed the acts constituting the alleged offence, and, in the second place, the man's insanity was attributed to other causes than ganja. The last case (No. 81) was given by Colonel Humfrey, Inspector-General of Police, Bombay. Colonel Humfrey was engaged in the arrest of the sepoy in this case; yet his recollection of the facts was not quite accurate, and led him to make the connection between the crime and bhang closer than it really was. He did not, however, actually attribute the crime to the drug. The judgment of the High Court is very clear, and shows that the murderous use of his rifle by this sepoy was deliberately planned, was due to revengeful feelings against the policeman, and was not due to the influence of bhang. Results of the examination of these cases. 551. Of these twenty-three cases then, the records in not less than eighteen show that the crimes cannot be connected with hemp drugs. There is one case on which doubt is thrown by subsequent discoveries. The connection between hemp drugs and crime is only established in the remaining four. It is astonishing to find how defective and misleading are the recollections which many witnesses retain even of cases with which they have had special opportunities of being well acquainted. It is instructive to see how preconceived notions based on rumour and tradition tend to preserve the impression of certain particulars, while the impressions of far more important features of the case are completely forgotten. In some cases these preconceived notions seem to prevail to distort the incident altogether and to create a picture in the mind of the witness quite different from the recorded facts. Some of the witnesses whose memories have thus failed them are men who might have been expected to be careful and accurate. Their failure must tend to increase the distrust with which similar evidence, which there has been no opportunity of testing, must be received. Summary of conclusions regard- ing effects. 552. The Commission have now examined all the evidence before them regarding the effects attributed to hemp drugs. It will be well to summarize briefly the conclusions to which they come. It has been clearly established that the occasional use of hemp in moderate doses may be beneficial; but this use may be regarded as medicinal in character. It is rather to the popular and common use of the drugs that the Commission will now confine their attention. It is convenient to consider the effects separately as affecting the physical, mental, or moral nature. In regard to the physical effects, the Commission have come to the conclusion that the moderate use of hemp drugs is practically attended by no evil results at all. There may be exceptional cases in which, owing to idiosyncracies of constitution, the drugs in even moderate use may be injurious. There is probably nothing the use of which may not possibly be injurious in cases of exceptional intolerance. There are also many cases where in tracts with a specially malarious climate, or in circumstances of hard work and exposure, the people attribute beneficial effects to the habitual moderate use of these drugs; and there is evidence to show that the popular impression may have some basis in fact. Speaking generally, the Commission are of opinion that the moderate use of hemp drugs appears to cause no appreciable physical injury of any kind. The excessive use does cause injury. As in the case of other intoxicants, excessive use tends to weaken the constitu- tion and to render the consumer more susceptible to disease. In respect to the particular diseases which according to a considerable number of witnesses
264 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XIII. should be associated directly with hemp drugs, it appears to be reasonably estab- lished that the excessive use of these drugs does not cause asthma; that it may indirectly cause dysentery by weakening the constitution as above indicated; and that it may cause bronchitis mainly through the action of the inhaled smoke on the bronchial tubes. In respect to the alleged mental effects of the drugs, the Commission have come to the conclusion that the moderate use of hemp drugs produces no inju- rious effects on the mind. It may indeed be accepted that in the case of special- ly marked neurotic diathesis, even the moderate use may produce mental injury. For the slightest mental stimulation or excitement may have that effect in such cases. But putting aside these quite exceptional cases, the moder- ate use of these drugs produces no mental injury. It is otherwise with the excessive use. Excessive use indicates and intensifies mental instability. It tends to weaken the mind. It may even lead to insanity. It has been said by Dr. Blanford that "two factors only are necessary for the causation of insanity, which are complementary, heredity, and stress. Both enter into every case: the stronger the influence of one factor, the less of the other factor is requisite to produce the result. Insanity, therefore, needs for its production a certain insta- bility of nerve tissue and the incidence of a certain disturbance." It appears that the excessive use of hemp drugs may, especially in cases where there is any weakness or hereditary predisposition, induce insanity. It has been shown that the effect of hemp drugs in this respect has hitherto been greatly exag- gerated, but that they do sometimes produce insanity seems beyond question. In regard to the moral effects of the drugs, the Commission are of opinion that their moderate use produces no moral injury whatever. There is no adequate ground for believing that it injuriously affects the character of the consumer. Excessive consumption, on the other hand, both indicates and inten- sifies moral weakness or depravity. Manifest excess leads directly to loss of self- respect, and thus to moral degradation. In respect to his relations with society, however, even the excessive consumer of hemp drugs is ordinarily inoffensive. His excesses may indeed bring him to degraded poverty which may lead him to dishonest practices; and occasionally, but apparently very rarely indeed, exces- sive indulgence in hemp drugs may lead to violent crime. But for all practical purposes it may be laid down that there is little or no connection between the use of hemp drugs and crime. Viewing the subject generally, it may be added that the moderate use of these drugs is the rule, and that the excessive use is comparatively exceptional. The moderate use practically produces no ill effects. In all but the most excep- tional cases, the injury from habitual moderate use is not appreciable. The excessive use may certainly be accepted as very injurious, though it must be admit- ted that in many excessive consumers the injury is not clearly marked. The injury done by the excessive use is, however, confined almost exclusively to the consumer himself; the effect on society is rarely appreciable. It has been the most striking feature in this inquiry to find how little the effects of hemp drugs have obtruded themselves on observation. The large number of witnesses of all classes who professed never to have seen these effects, the vague statements made by many who professed to have observed them, the very few witnesses who could so recall a case as to give any definite account of it, and the manner in which a large proportion of these cases broke down on the first attempt to examine them, are facts which combine to show most clearly how little injury society has hitherto sustained from hemp drugs.
CHAPTER XIV. THE POLICY OF HEMP DRUG ADMINISTRATION. General principles regarding sump- tuary laws and their application to India. 553. The question of prohibiting the growth of the hemp plant and the sale of ganja and allied drugs is one which stands in the forefront of the present inquiry. It has been remarked by a well known historian* that "no laws are of any service which are above the working level of public morality, and the deeper they are carried down into life, the larger become the opportunities of evasion." If these words are true as applied to England under a feudal system, they are much more true in the present day as applied to British India. The Gov- ernment of this country has not grown out of the forces contained within it, but has been superimposed upon them, and the paternal system of government which may have been suitable in England during the sixteenth century, and in the initial development of some Indian provinces during the period immediately following their annexation, becomes purely visionary when public opinion is in process of formation and the needs of the people are year by year finding more ready expression. Occasionally, no doubt, the Legislature in India has anti- cipated a standard of morality not universally accepted by the people, as in the case of laws relating to infanticide or the burning of Hindu widows; but these measures were passed under an overwhelming sense of the necessity of correct- ing popular notions of morality in matters coming well within the sphere of Government, and in the assurance that in the course of time they could not fail to secure the assent of all intelligent members of the community. In the chapter of Mill's Political Economy which treats of the non-inter- ference principle, a distinction is made between two kinds of intervention by the Government266 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XIV. as is personal only, involving no consequences, none at least of a painful or inju- rious kind, to other people, I hold that it is allowable in all, and in the more thoughtful and cultivated often a duty, to assert and promulgate with all the force they are capable of their opinion of what is good or bad, admirable or contemptible, but not to compel others to conform to that opinion, whether the force used is that of extra legal coercion, or exerts itself by means of the law. Even in those portions of conduct which do affect the interests of others, the onus of making out a case always lies on the defenders of legal prohibitions. It is not merely a constructive or presumptive injury to others which will justify the interference of law with individual freedom. To be prevented from what one is inclined to, or from acting contrary to one's own judgment of what is desirable, is not only always irksome, but always tends, pro tanto, to starve the develop- ment of some portion of the bodily or mental faculties, either sensitive or active; and, unless the conscience of the individual goes freely with the legal restraint, it partakes, either in a great or in a small degree, of the degradation of slavery. Scarcely any degree of utility short of absolute necessity will justify a prohibi- tory regulation, unless it can also be made to recommend itself to the general conscience; unless persons of ordinary good intentions either believe already, or can be induced to believe, that the thing prohibited is a thing which they ought not to wish to do." These remarks have been given at length, because the Com- mission believe that they contain a clear exposition of the principles which should guide them in deciding whether the prohibition of the hemp drugs should be authoritatively enforced by Government. The question of entirely suppress- ing all intoxicants. 554. Now, a certain number of persons (among whom may in all probability be reckoned the mover of the question in the House of Commons which led to the appointment of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission) deem it to be the duty of the British Govern- ment to suppress the trade in all intoxicants in all the countries under its sway; and there are no doubt special circumstances in India which render it less impossible than in some other countries to consider even so drastic a policy. These are notably the general sobriety of its races and the feeling, popular as well as religious, which prevails against their use among a large section of the commu- nity. Even then no appeal in support of such a measure can be made to the public morality or practice of civilised nations at large, nor, so far as the Commission are aware, to any marked success attending the experiment in parti- cular instances. In the exceptional cases in which the experiment has been attend- ed with partial success (as in some of the American States), the reformation of the habit has become an object of desire to the majority of the people, and the enactment for promoting such reformation has presented itself less as a re- strictive force than as an auxiliary agency. Not laid before the Commission. 555. But the Commission are not called upon to pronounce on so wide an issue. It was not upon the basis of this general principle that the Secretary of State for India accepted the proposal made in the House of Commons, nor do the instructions issued to the Commission by the Government of India cover so wide a field. The question of prohibiting the production and sale of the hemp drugs in India has to be considered by the Commission apart from the general question, and such prohibition must be justified, if at all, on some more special ground than the mere fact that they are intoxicants.
CH. XIV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 267 The past history of the case how far to be relied upon. 556. Again, there are a certain number of persons whose evidence before the Commission points to the assumption that the case for prohibition of the hemp drugs has already been established in the records of the Government, and that further enquiry implies a wilful blindness to what has been abundantly proved by such records. A reference to Chapter XII of this Report will show how untrustworthy these records are in regard to the production of insanity by the use of the drugs268 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XIV. arrived at: "Upon a consideration of all the opinions thus collected, it does not appear to the Governor-General in Council to be specially proved that hemp incites to crime more than other drugs or than spirits. And there is some evid- ence to show that on rare occasions this drug, usually so noxious, may be use- fully taken. There can, however, be no doubt that its habitual use does tend to produce insanity. The total number of cases of insanity is small in proportion to the population, and not large even in proportion to the number of ganja smokers; but of the cases of insanity produced by the excessive use of drugs or spirits, by far the largest number must be attributed to the abuse of hemp. In Lower Bengal the circumstances have admitted of a system under which the consumption of ganja has been reduced one-half, while the amount of duty levied on it has been doubled. It would be very desirable to control the cultivation and preparation of ganja and bhang elsewhere in the same way. But it is believed that this would not be easy; indeed, it would probably be impracticable. More- over, with the exception of the Chief Commissioners of British Burma and the Central Provinces, the Local Governments are not in favour of altering existing arrangements. His Excellency in Council, however, trusts that the various Local Governments and Administrations will endeavour, wherever it may be possible, to discourage the consumption of ganja and bhang by placing restrictions on their cultivation, preparation, and retail, and imposing on their use as high a rate of duty as can be levied without inducing illicit practices. As regards British Burma, the Chief Commissioner has already been informed that the Governor-General in Council concurs with him in thinking that the cultivation and consumption of ganja should be absolutely prohibited, and it has been prohibited from the beginning of the year 1873-74." In 1877 the Bengal Government appointed a special officer, Babu Hem Chunder Kerr, to make a full inquiry into the details of the cultivation of ganja, the sufficiency or otherwise of the present safeguards, and the reforms which it might be advisable to introduce. Sir Ashley Eden's conclusions on this officer's report in regard to the effects of ganja and policy to be followed were as follows: "The Lieutenant-Governor has himself no doubt that the use of ganja in any form is injurious to the consumer, and that it is the duty of Government to make the tax on this article as high as it can possibly bear. Unfortunately it is habitually used by large numbers of the lower classes of the population, who would, if deprived of it altogether, apparently find in the leaves of the wild hemp plant and in other drugs narcotics and stimulants of equally deleterious character. It does not seem possible, therefore, to stop the cultiva- tion altogether. The policy of Government must be to limit its production and sale by a high rate of duty without placing the drug entirely beyond the reach of those who will insist upon having it." The last important utterance on the subject previous to the appoint- ment of the Commission is contained in the letter of the Government of India, Finance Department, to Her Majesty's Secretary of State, No. 212, dated 9th August 1892, in which the following remarks occur: "We are inclined to believe that ganja is the most noxious of all intoxicants now commonly used in India. But even if the absolute prohibition of the use of the drug could be enforced, the result might be to induce the use of still more noxious drugs. India abounds with plants growing wild from which drugs can be procured which are more deleterious in their effects than ganja. One such
CH. XIV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 269 plant is the dhatura (Stramonium), the seeds of which are already used to inten- sify the narcotic effects of bhang, a liquid preparation of hemp leaves; and we apprehend that if the use of ganja were suppressed altogether, dhatura might be largely resorted to by the poorer classes as a means of satisfying their craving for stimulants. Apart, however, from the objections just mentioned, we believe that it would be impossible to enforce in India a prohibition of the use of ganja. That drug is produced in Native States, and the difficulties in the way of preventing its import from them, if the supply in British India were cut off, would be immense. It would not, moreover, be possible to suppress the supply in British India. The hemp plant grows readily in India, in many places wild without cultivation of any kind, and it would be easy for any one addicted to the use of ganja to grow a plant or two in the enclosure of his own house and in nooks and corners which would be safe from observation and from the risk of detection. The question in the House of Commons suggests that as the possession and sale of ganja has been prohibited for many years in Burma, it is desirable that the same pro- hibition should be extended to other provinces of British India. The analogy of Burma does not, however, apply to India. When the prohibition was enforced in Burma, the drug was very little used by the Native Burmese, its consumption being almost entirely confined to coolies and other immigrants from India; and the cultivation of the plant in Burma, which had never been extensive, had vir- tually ceased, the consumers being dependent on importations for their supplies. In India, on the other hand, the practice of ganja smoking has existed from time immemorial, and among certain sects of Hindus, ascetics, and religi- ous mendicants hemp intoxication is habitually indulged in; and, as explained in the preceding paragraph, it would be impossible to suppress the growth of the plant. But, although we consider it impracticable to enforce the absolute prohi- bition of the use of ganja, we fully recognise it as our duty to restrict its con- sumption as far as practicable, and we have distinctly laid down the policy to be pursued in respect of this drug in our Resolution of the 17th December 1873 already quoted. The annual reports of Excise Administration show that the sub- ject has since been continually before Local Governments, who are making every possible endeavour to minimise the evils and discourage the use of the drug wherever it is a source of danger to consumers." Thus "restraining the use and improving the revenue by the imposi- tion of suitable taxation," "discouraging the consumption by placing restric- tions on the cultivation, preparation, and retail, and imposing on their use as high a rate of duty as can be levied without inducing illicit practices," "limit- ing the production and sale by a high rate of duty without placing the drug en- tirely beyond the reach of those who will insist upon having it," "restricting consumption as far as practicable, minimising the evils, and discouraging the use of the drug wherever it is a source of danger to consumers" have from time to time been the watch-words of the Government in the matter of the hemp drugs, a policy only once definitely abandoned, viz., in the case of Burma, where total prohibition was introduced in 1873. Prohibition in other countries. 557. Allusion must be made to precedents for the prohibition of the hemp drugs in other countries in order to complete these general observations. Excepting British Burma (reference to which will be made further on), the Commission only know of four cases of pro- 68
270 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XIV. hibition, viz., in Turkey, Egypt, Greece, and Trinidad. For the first three of these, the only information at the disposal of the Commission is contained in the communications from Her Majesty's representatives addressed to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in 1892 in consequence of a requisition made on them by the Earl of Rosebery at the request of Mr. W. S. Caine, M.P. Turkey. 558. The ground of the prohibition in Turkey is thus stated in a note addressed by the Grand Vizir to the Ministry of Commerce, Constantinople, on 1st March 1292 (sic):"From the reports furnished by the Imperial Medical Council, it appeared that the use of hashish in the preparation of medicines was extremely rare, and that, being a narcotic, its use must of necessity be injurious, and that consequently the sup- pression of the cultivation of hashish could not fail to prove highly advantageous." The effect of the prohibition is thus described in an enclosure to the Ambassa- dor's reply: "The importation and sale in Turkey of hashish, though contraband, is still, I hear, largely carried on, and is used for smoking, in the composition of various sweetmeats, and as an opiate in general." Egypt. 559. In Egypt the cultivation, use, and importation of hashish were first for- bidden in 1868, but in 1874 it was allowed to be imported on payment of duty. In November 1877 an order was received from Constantinople that all hashish brought into Egypt was to be seized and destroyed, and finally, in March 1879, the importation and culti- vation of hashish were prohibited by a Khedivial decree. In March 1884 it was provided that confiscated hashish should be sold by the Customs (for delivery abroad) instead of being destroyed as formerly, and the proceeds of the sale divided amongst the informers and officers who took part in the seizure. "This measure was rendered necessary," says Mr. Caillard, the Director-General of the Customs, "by the absence of any fund from which rewards could be distributed; while, on the other hand, the profits of smuggling being very great, large sums were paid by the smugglers to insure the silence or com- plicity of the Customs officers, coastguards-men, and others. A considerable number of persons are employed in the smuggling trade, many of them having no other means of subsistence. Great ingenuity is displayed by the smugglers in this illicit trade, and no sooner has one trick been discovered than another is invented. The great obstacle, however, to the complete repression of the contra- band trade is the refusal of some of the European Governments to recognize the right of the Egyptian Government to search suspected shops or warehouses, and to punish the delinquents by fine as well as confiscation................... In view of the impossibility of suppressing the contraband trade in hashish under the circumstances described above, I suggested to the Minister of Finance the desirability of removing the prohibition against the importation of the drug, and I proposed to collect a customs duty of P T. 100 per kilogramme (9s. 3d.per lb.), besides a license-tax on the sale of the hashish. It has been abun- dantly proved that the vice of hashish smoking cannot be suppressed by legis- lation, whereas by a system of licenses it may be kept under control to some extent." Mr. Caillard estimates that the quantity of hashish consumed annual- ly in Egypt cannot be less than 50,000 okes (about lbs. 140,000) notwithstanding the prohibition. He states that the hashish appears to be manufactured chiefly in Greece.

[CH. XIV. systematically examined, the first question for the Commission to decide is whe- ther such justification is to be found in the evidence before them, and the second whether, if this is so, prohibition is feasible and advisable on other grounds. These will now be considered. Prohibition of bhang. 564 The effects of the hemp drugs have been treated in Chapters X to XIII of the Report; and as the first result of these conclu- sions, the Commission are prepared to state that the suppression of the use of bhang would be totally unjustifiable. It is established to their satisfaction that this use is very ancient, and that it has some religious sanc- tion among a large body of Hindus; that it enters into their social customs; that it is almost without exception harmless in moderation, and perhaps in some cases beneficial; that the abuse of it is not so harmful as the abuse of alcohol; that its suppression, involving the extirpation of the wild hemp plant, would in some tracts be a matter of great difficulty; that such a measure would be extremely unpopular, and would give rise to widespread discontent; and, finally, that, if successfully accomplished, it would lead to the use of more hurtful stimulants. The Com- mission deem it unnecessary to traverse the evidence further than has been done in the preceding chapters of this report in support of these propositions. It is almost unanimous in regard to them. The utmost that is necessary in regard to this product is that it should be brought under more effective control, and this matter will be dealt with further on. But absolute prohibition is, in the opinion of the Commission, entirely out of the question. Prohibition of ganja and charas. 565. Though it has been shown that as a rule ganja and charas are used in moderation, and that the moderate use ordinarily does not cause appreciable injury, yet it has been established that the excessive use of these forms of hemp drugs has been more injurious than in the case of bhang. Whether they should be prohibited or merely controlled is a question which might be settled merely with reference to their ascertained effects. The Commission consider that the effects are not such as to call for prohibition, and on the general principles discussed in the open- ing paragraphs of this chapter, such interference would be unjustifiable. Never- theless, it seems advisable to refer to the other evidence with a view to ascertaining the generally prevailing views on the subject, and considering the grounds on which prohibition is advocated or opposed. The evidence regarding prohibi- tion of ganja and charas may be considered together. 566. In reviewing the evidence on these points, it will not be necessary to draw a distinction between ganja and charas. The effects of these two drugs have been shown to be similar, though charas is cc CH. XIV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 273 North-Western Provinces and Sind relate to ganja and charas, both of which are consumed. Supply of ganja and charas in its relation to prohibition. 567. A few remarks, however, recapitulating the local conditions of ganja and charas will not be out of place. Charas is practi- cally a foreign article. Small amounts are imported from Nepal and Gwalior, but they may be left out of the account. The bulk comes from Yarkand through the Himalayan passes, or to a much smaller degree from other parts of Central Asia through the routes on the frontier of Afghanistan. It would not be a very difficult matter to stop these imports, though the co-operation of the Kashmir Darbar would be neces- sary in regard to Yarkand charas. It may, therefore, be accepted that the supply of charas might be cut off without much difficulty, though, as this article forms the principal import from Yarkand, the prohibition of charas would paralyse, if not extinguish, the trade with this country. In regard to ganja, the problem is more complex. Ganja is regularly cultivated in Bengal, the Central Prov- inces, Madras, Bombay, and Berar. In Bengal and the Central Provinces, the cultivation of the hemp plant for its production is under complete control. In Berar cultivation is only permitted under license. In the other tracts of British territory it is not directly controlled. Assuming that control is possible in these tracts, it does not follow that it would be equally possible to prevent cultivation altogether. Moreover, there still remains a considerable amount of production in many of the Native States all over India. To induce these States to prohibit cultivation would be a difficult matter, and, even if this were done, the suppres- sion of illicit cultivation would offer the most serious difficulties. For, though ganja of good quality requires some cultivation and tending, the evidence before the Commission tends to establish the fact that ganja of an inferior kind can be manufactured from the spontaneous or casual growth which is found near human habitations and amidst cultivation of other crops in many parts of India. While, therefore, it cannot be asserted that the task of preventing the manufacture of ganja is an impossible one, it would certainly at the present time be attended with considerable difficulty. Opinions of the witnesses regard- ing prohibition of ganja and charas. 568. The question addressed to the witnesses regarding the prohibition of the hemp drugs (No. 35) was so framed as to elicit in the first place opinions as to the feasibility of such a measure. The considerations bearing upon the subject were also set forth in the form of subsidiary questions. The question whether the witnesses advocated prohibition was not specifically put, but it is not difficult, comparing the answers to the questions above mentioned with those relating to other questions, to decide what the opinion of each witness is on this question. Those who hold decided views have no doubt generally stated them in some portion of their answers, and at all events ample opportunity of doing so was afforded them. A larger number of the witnesses have contented themselves with merely giving an affirmative or negative answer to the questions on the subject. It is impossible to attach much importance to such answers. The Commission have abstracted them and considered them, but they feel bound to give far more weight to the opinions of witnesses whose replies show that they have formulated an opinion on the desirability of prohibi- tion. Some account will now be given of these answers. 69

Out of the total of 1,193 witnesses, 575 have expressed a decided opinion on the question of prohibition. Of these only 99 advocate it in their answers. The remainder are against it.

The only witnesses indeed of the latter class who favour prohibition are three in the Punjab, where charas and not ganja is consumed. The most important of these opinions on either side will now be specified. The most forcible opinions in favour of prohibition will be quoted at some length in order that the argument for this view may be thoroughly appreciated. The opinions against prohibition are too numerous to be quoted, but the witnesses will be named under headings setting forth the most prominent views expressed. Bengal opinions in favour of pro- hibition of ganja. 570. The Bengal witnesses in favour of prohibition of ganja consist of a Sub- Deputy Collector, an Assistant Surgeon, two Medical Practitioners, an Honorary Magistrate, two zamin- dars, two pleaders, a delegate from the Indian Relief Society, Calcutta, the Secretary to the Band of Hope, Faridpur, the Secre- tary to the Bogra Medical Society, and two Missionaries. The Commission cannot find much to quote from these opinions, but the following are the most forcible:CH. XIV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 275 that the privation to the consumers would not be serious, and that it is difficult to suggest any drug more deleterious than ganja to which they could take. The Society contends that the alleged religious sanction to the use of the drugs is a fallacy, and refers to the opinions of several pandits in support of this view. The Society argues that to meet the deficit in the revenue, which would be about 24 lakhs per annum, the salaries of European officers should be cut down, the duties on cotton goods re-imposed, and the income-tax increased with an enhanced taxable minimum. Savings would be effected by reduction of establishment and by decreased cost of lunatic asylums. (236) Secretary, Band of Hope Temperance Society, Faridpur, Babu Purna Chandra Maitra: "This Society begs to urge upon the Commission to consider the justice and propriety of a just, benign, and Christian Government to allow cultivation and sale of a drug which has been excluded from some countries, and in England doubly protected in the poison list." The witness argues that the drug "has been unreservedly condemned by eminent doctors as one of the most dangerous poisons known, as the most potent cause of lunacy, and as the most pernicious and deleterious of all excitants ever in use in any country." He ad- mits that there are a number of jogis, sanyasis, fakirs, and mendicants addicted to ganja smoking, but states that ganja smoking forms no part of their religion, and there is not a single Hindu or Muhammadan religious book which sanctions the use of ganja. "No real disaffection can under the benign rule of the British Government be seriously apprehended, and, even in the event of there being such apprehension, the fact should not be lost sight of that the Government in this case will have the support of the bulk of the population." He alleges that ganja produces crime, and that the taxation, amounting to 22 lakhs, is a drain on the poverty-stricken and half-famished people of Bengal. He finds it difficult to suggest a substitute for ganja, but liquor may be one, and a peculiar prepara- tion of strong tobacco may also serve the purpose. (134) Secretary to Bogra Medical Society (10 members), Pyari Sanker Dass Gupta, L. M. S.: "The prohibition will give rise to no political danger. For the ganja smokers have very little influence over society. The Government has faced questions of a greater religious character, as the Suttee or the Age of Consent Act, with boldness. This is comparatively a minor question affecting only depraved men." (203) Rev. W. B. Phillips, Missionary.: "What with liquor and opium and hemp drugs of various kinds, all licensed by Government, it does seem as if the population were terribly exposed to degrading influences. It is not my prov- ince to face the difficult task of dealing with these evils; and I sincerely sympa- thize with the Government in the heavy duty of solving the grave problems involved. But I do feel it my duty to set forth as strongly as possible the assurance that very much mischief is being worked in the country by the various intoxicants so freely and largely sold. I hardly care to distinguish between opium, alcohol, and ganja. I regard them all as bad. My mind is so impressed with the evil effects of excessive use that I do not care to consider the moderate use. I would wish Government to begin with ganja, to proceed with little delay against opium, and then tackle alcohol. I prefer this as a matter of policy, as ganja is easiest dealt with. I am prepared to prohibit all three intoxicants on account of the evil which I see done by them."
276 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XIV. (81) Kali Das Mukerji, Sub-Deputy Collector: After advocating prohibi- tion of ganja on the grounds of the evil effects, and stating that there would be no danger from the discontent caused owing to the small number of the consumers, the witness proceeds: "The reasons usually put forward in favour of ganja consumption are as follows: (1) that Hindu friars and jogis cannot do without it, for it helps them in their religious contemplation, and sustains them under severe exertion and exposure; (2) that it is a safeguard against disease in malarious tracts; and (3) that it serves the labouring classes as a refreshing stimulant, alleviating fatigue. I do not think that any of these reasons is con- clusive, though plausible. In fact, none of them stands the test of close examin- ation. If any intoxicating drug is at all necessary for friars and jogis, alcohol, opium, or siddhi may serve the purpose. Eight kinds of intoxicating drugs are prescribed in the Tantras for Hindu devotees, and it is optional with them to take any if they care to do so at all................... That ganja is a safeguard against disease in malarious tracts is not necessarily true................... Even as a stimulant and remover of fatigue, ganja has very little to recommend it to the labouring classes................... A careful observation is sure to establish the fact that any ordinary labourer whose only stimulant is tobacco is on the whole a better workman than his ganja consuming brother." Opinions against prohibition of ganja in Bengal. 571. It is impossible to quote the mass of opinion against prohibition of ganja, but the following analysis of some of the most important opinions will give an idea of the strength of these opinions:CH.

The opinions in favour of prohibition of ganja in Assam are those of a Civil Surgeon, the Secretary to the Tezpur Raiyats Association, the Secretary to the Upper Assam Association, a merchant, and a pensioned Overseer, Public Works Department, and member of a Local Board. There is nothing especially to note in these opinions. Opinion against. 573. Against prohibition we have the Commissioner of the Assam Valley, the Commissioner of Excise, the Director of Land Records and Agriculture, an Officiating Deputy Commissioner, a Civil Surgeon, an Extra Assistant Commissioner, a medical practitioner, four pleaders, and four planters. Mr. Driberg, Commissioner of Excise, says: "It would be useless to prohi- bit the use of ganja in a province like Assam, surrounded as it is by independent hill people, who would cultivate it in their hills and smuggle it down with little risk of detection. Any prohibition will only lead to the increase of illicit con- sumption and to the secret use of the drug, which would be decidedly bad; of course, stop cultivation in Bengal, and the prohibition of the use of excise ganja could be enforced; but there would be serious discontent, though in this province 70
278 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XIV. it might not amount to a political danger, and the prohibition would be followed by recourse to opium, and in some cases to alcohol." The evidence of planters tends generally to show that the use of ganja by the garden coolies, who (ex- cept in the western districts of the Assam Valley and those of the Surma Valley, all of which border on Bengal) are the principal consumers, produces no serious effects. There is nothing in any of the Assam evidence to controvert these views. North-Western Provinces. Opinions in favour of prohibition of ganja and charas. 574. The advocates of prohibition of ganja and charas in the North-Western Provinces are as follows: 6 subordinate civil offi- cers, 9 subordinate medical officers and private medical practitioners, and 18 non-officials. But few of these witnesses give any reasons for their opinions. And the Com- mission are not able to quote any one of them as having any special weight. The only opinion which it appears worth while to quote is that of a Collector (Mr. Addis (4), who does not, however, specifically recommend prohibition. He says: "It probably would be feasible to prohibit the use of all these drugs. Public opinion is against their use, and the people are very obedient to authority. The prohibition would certainly lead to the increased use of opium and alcohol." Opinions against prohibition. 575. On the other hand, the opinions against prohibition are very strong. The following is an analysis of some of the most important:CH. XIV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 279 (21) Mr. Gillan, Assistant Collector.

The advocates of the prohibition of charas in the Punjab are as follows:280 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XIV. I can quite believe the moderate occasional use of the drugs may be compara- tively harmless, but I am not aware that they are commonly used occasionally and in moderation. They may, however, be so used for all I know." Mr. Wilson, Deputy Commissioner (14), says that he should like to see the experiment made in selected districts of prohibiting trade in charas (and bhang) altogether. As regards charas, he thinks the prohibition would be feasible, as it is imported, and the discontent would be insignificant. He knows of no class, such as labourers, who take the drug in moderation as an ordinary stimulant. Among fakirs and other excessive consumers, he thinks the use produces great evils, and that there is no more harmful drug which they are likely to take to. He does not know anything of the use of dhatura except its administration as a poison. He thinks sudden prohibition would be cruel. He would therefore begin by taxation and gradually raise it, leaving the question of total prohibition to be decided by experience. The evidence of Arjan Singh, Extra Assistant Commissioner (19), is much to the same effect, but he states that the use of dhatura is general among the followers of Siva at the Shivratri in the Dera Ghazi Khan district. He says it is taken in very small quantities, so that its effect is almost imperceptible. General Millet (69), formerly District Superintendent of Police, would like to see all intoxicants prohibited which cannot be proved to be actually necessary. He thinks gradual prohibition of the hemp drugs feasible, and that educated, intelligent native public opinion, which to a great extent leads that of the lower classes, would support prohibition. Discontent at first among the degraded classes would be inevitable, but there would be no political danger, though tact and discretion would be needed and calm-minded European officials at the helm. He fears that recourse to alcohol would be the result. Shekh Riaz Husain, zamindar (67), thinks that "having regard for the welfare and good of the people which the British Government has in view, the prohibition of the hemp drugs (including bhang) is imperatively necessary. Loyal and intelligent subjects and well-wishers of the country would welcome the prohibition, though the unscrupulous habitual consumers would indeed dislike it. But as it would be for the good of the people, it is not hoped that any class of persons would resent it. The enforcement of the prohibition should be effected like other new laws and regulations, exceptions being made to some extent in the case of the existing old habitual consumers, because its sudden stoppage would cause them serious privation. The discontent resulting would not amount to a political danger. If it were possible to make charas as expensive as alcohol, that would be one way of dealing with the subject." Sardar Sujan Singh, Rai Bahadur, Contractor (59), considers charas as certainly most injurious, and thinks its use should most certainly be prohibited. It does no good to anybody. There are not many kahars who take it. Those who do, go to the bad. He does not know of the use of dhatura as an intoxicant. The use of madak and chandu is more injurious than charas, and they also should be prohibited as well as liquor. He would not recommend immediate prohibition, but would put on such a tax, increasing it gradually, as to make it impossible for the majority of people to buy them at all.
CH. XIV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 281 Dr. H. M. Clark, Missionary (46), would like to see charas prohibited if it were possible. He thinks, however; that alcohol does more harm than charas. He cannot believe that a moderate use of charas is possible. Fakirs and devotees are the chief consumers. Devi Dayal, Editor of the Kaistha Mitra,* Lahore, circulation 300 copies (83), says: "If charas be called poison (fatal, killing, murdering drug), it is not an exag- geration of any kind.

The Madras witnesses in favour of prohibition are a Civil Surgeon, a subordinate civil officer, a medical practitioner, a Hindu priest, and six missionaries. Dr. King (85) says: "The restriction of the sale of ganja under condi- tions similar to those required for poisonous drugs in Great Britain would be an unqualified blessing to the country, thus contrasting with the action taken against opium, which agitation I believe to be unnecessary and mischievous. I consider special measures should be taken to restrain the use of ganja by sepoys, and especially to prevent the young sepoy from acquiring the habit." In oral examina- tion, however, Dr. King stated as follows: "My opinion of the effect of the moderate use in impairing the moral sense and inducing laziness, etc., is a general impression and not based on actual observation. My impression is based on the fact that persons alleged to have been ganja smokers have pre- sented these characteristics. They were pointed out as notorious ganja smokers. I did not discriminate in these cases between the moderate and excessive use." Syad Mahmud (122) says: "It is an unquestionable fact that ganja, bhang, and charas are poisons, and this fact is admitted by all. In my opinion their suppression would be an act of virtue deserving of future reward, but it is not advisable to suppress their use at once. Its suppression should be regulated under certain rules without any loss to the State. To the best of my knowledge and researches, alcohol cannot be safely used as a substitute for ganja, charas, and bhang." Rev. Mr. Laflamme (153), speaking on behalf of the Baptist Missionary Conferences of the Presidency, advocates prohibition in these terms: "Owing to the scarcity of shops in these parts, practical prohibition exists. Much that is consumed is consumed illicitly. The introduction of the license system seems to have had no appreciable effect on the use of the drugs. The ganja is nearly all grown by the consumers in their own yards." "The drugs should all be so safeguarded as to prevent or minimize any possible harm resulting from their abuse." "The general sense of the people is opposed to the use of the drugs." So far as the witness can gather, the members of the Mission are united in the belief that in these parts hemp drugs are far less injurious than opium and alcohol;
284 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XIV. thus far that the latter are not only much more extensively used, but much more baleful in their effects. Two other missionaries, though neutral in opinion, are worth quoting. Rev. Mr. Pittendrigh, Missionary (160), says that he would have ulti- mate prohibition in view if possible, but there is not much ground for special inter- ference in anything that he has seen. Another Missionary, the Rev. Mr. Goffin (145), cannot undertake to criticise the present or any system of excise administration. His impression is that Government would be wise to adopt a strictly "let-alone" policy, leaving it to the spread of education and enlightenment among the people to prevent and lessen all its effects. The province of Gov- ernment should be carefully to watch such effects, and wherever and whenever necessary interfere with prohibitive legislation. Such necessity, however, in his opinion would not often occur. Opinions against prohibition. 581. Among those who are opposed to prohibition, the evidence of the following witnesses may be quoted:CH. XIV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 285 relation to the hemp drugs should be one of restriction, as far as restriction is possible, and that, if absolute prohibition were possible, he thinks it would be a good thing. Owing, however, to the fact that the territories of the Bombay Presidency interlace so extensively with foreign territory, and to the feeling which would be aroused among the consumers and those who sympathize with them, it would in his opinion be impossible or undesirable. The Secretary to the Arya Samaj in Bombay (109) states that while fully sympathising with the objects of the Commission, which are apparently understood to be the restriction or prohibition of the drugs, the Arya Samaj "is of opinion that any Governmental action in the direction of further restricting the preparation and sale of the drug will be productive of very little good. The Samaj believes that education of the masses is the only proper and effective remedy for correcting such baneful habits, and fears that any compulsion in this matter is likely to drive the consumers of these comparatively innocuous drugs to the use of more injurious intoxicants that are plentifully supplied to the people like the various preparations containing alcohol." The Samaj prays that the Government will devise measures for the restriction of the sale of European liquor in India, and leave the hemp drugs to themselves. The only thorough advocate of prohibition whose opinion is worth specifying is Rao Sahib Shesho Krisna Madkavi (41), who considers such prohibition very necessary, and holds that, although there would be temporary discontent among the consumers, such discontent would not amount to a political danger, "the people in this part of the country being loyal and of mild nature, and the proportion of the persons using bhang and ganja to the general population being too small to be taken into consideration." Opinions against prohibition. 583. On the other hand, the opinions against prohibition are weighty. The following may be specially quoted:286 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH.

The statistical detail has been given in the table in paragraph 569. General conclusions in regard to total prohibition of ganja, charas, and bhang. 585. A general review of the evidence relating to the question of prohibition of ganja and charas brings the Commission to the same conclusion as that which they have framed upon a consideration of the evidence on the as- certained effects alone. The weight of the evidence above abstracted is almost entirely against prohibition. Not only is such a measure unnecessary with refer- ence to the effects, but it is abundantly proved that it is considered unnecessary or impossible by those most competent to form an opinion on general grounds of experience; that it would be strongly resented by religious mendicants, or would be regarded as an interference with religion, or would be likely to become a political danger; and that it might lead to the use of dhatura or other intoxicants worse than
CH. XIV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 287 ganja. Apart from all this, there is another consideration which has been urged in some quarters with a manifestation of strong feeling, and to which the Com- mission are disposed to attach some importance, viz., that to repress the hemp drugs in India and to leave alcohol alone would be misunderstood by a large number of persons who believe, and apparently not without reason, that more harm is done in this country by the latter than by the former. The conclusion of the Commission regarding bhang has been given in paragraph 564; under all the circumstances they now unhesitatingly give their verdict against such a violent measure as total prohibition in respect of any of the hemp drugs. Policy in regard to hemp drugs. 586. Failing prohibition, the question arises, what should be the policy of the Government in regard to the hemp drugs ? On this point some important evidence has been recorded, and the Commission deem it to be within the scope of their duty to state in general terms their own conclusions. In the first place, then, they are of opinion that in view of the harmful effects produced by the excessive use, and in exceptional cases even by the moderate use, of the drugs, the action of the Government should be directed towards restraining the former and avoiding all encouragement to the latter. The object should be to prevent the consumers, as far as may be possible, from doing harm to themselves and to lessen the inducements to the formation of the habit which might lead to such harm. In aiming at this object, however, other considerations need to be kept in view. There is in the first place the question of illicit consumption. If the restriction imposed by Government is counterbalanced by a corresponding increase in smuggling, no advantage is gained, but, on the contrary, a moral wrong is done to the community apart from the annoyance necessitated by such restrictions. Then, if there is a legitimate use of the drugs, restrictions should not be such as to make the exercise of this use impossible. The Commission have formed the opinion that there is a legitimate use of the hemp drugs, and that it exists generally among the poorest of the population. Again, if the restrictions lead to the use of more deleterious substances, or even drive the people from a habit the evil of which is known to another of which the evil may be greater, they are no longer justifiable. The policy of Government must be tempered by all these considerations, and the neglect of any one of them may lead to serious error. Objection to raising revenue from hemp drugs. 587. In this connection an objection to the present system, which has been raised by some few of the witnesses, deserves a brief notice. They have laid down the maxim that the Gov- ernment should not derive revenue from the vices of the people, and starting from this theory they condemn the taxation of the hemp drugs. Now, if the habit of using the hemp drugs were so disastrous as to call for suppression, and such sup- pression were possible, the conclusion would be just. But this is not the Commis- sion's view, and the policy which the Government has generally adopted of restricting the use by taxation is in their opinion the right one. Taxation by itself does not imply encouragement, though the methods by which it is raised may, if not guarded, tend to encouragement. And this is perhaps the tendency which the witnesses above alluded to mean to criticise. As regards the taxing of intoxicants generally, the Commission cannot do better than quote from a standard work on political economy by Professor Henry Sidgwick (Chapter VIII, paragraph 7): "Generally speaking, it is desirable to select
288 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XIV. for taxation commodities of which the consumption is not likely to be restricted to any great extent through the desire to avoid payment of the tax, as all such restriction increases the excess of the loss to the public caused by the tax over and above the gain to the Treasury, since the persons who are driven to consume commodities which they do not like so well suffer a manifest loss of utility. But there is one exceptional case very important in our own system of taxation in which this principle does not apply, viz., where the commodity taxed is largely consumed in excess of what is salutary. So far as such excess is prevented by the tax, the restriction of consumption is positively beneficial to the community; and though legislative interference with the sole object of limiting the consumption of dangerous commodities is emphatically condemned by advocates of natural liberty, they have not for the most part pushed their antagonism so far as to maintain that the selection of taxes ought not to be partly influenced by this consideration." In the opinion of the Commission, the general principle may be fearlessly asserted that it is right to tax intoxicants; and the higher they are taxed the better, provided the considera- tions mentioned in the last paragraph are not lost sight of. The primary object of such taxation should not be the enhancement of the revenue, but the control of the habit; and, if this end is kept in view, the revenue which flows into the Treasury from this source need be viewed with no more suspicion than the fines on criminals for breaches of the law. If it is necessary to put briefly in words a description of what the policy of the Government should be in regard to the hemp drugs, it would be somewhat as follows: To control their use, and especially their harmful use, in such a manner as to avoid a worse evil, and, subject to this proviso, to tax them as fully as possible. Systematic treatment necessary. 588. In order to bring about such control as will enable Government to deal thoroughly with the question, systematic treatment is necessary. The system approved for one province must not be reversed in the next. A standard of administration consistent with itself must be put before the Native States, which in many cases are interlaced with British territory, or it will be impossible for them to co-operate. On this subject the evidence of Mr. J. W. Neill, Judicial Commissioner, Central Provinces, may be quoted. He says: "I think in the case of a drug so generally consumed as ganja, the system of taxation and control should be, if not uniform for all provinces, yet on somewhat the same lines, and that the tax should fall, if not at the same rate, still at such rates that there should be no great temptation to smuggle from one part of British India into another." It is doubtless owing to the same feeling that Mr. Cadell, Member of the Board of Revenue, North- Western Provinces, records his opinion that "the present system of taxation (in those provinces) is not worthy of maintenance," and that "other Governments should not alter rates of taxation where other provinces are concerned without consulting them." This is also no doubt what underlies the opinion of the Madras Board of Revenue given in March 1892 that "restrictions will gradually have to be placed on the cultivation, possession, and transport of ganja." In this connection the opinions of Mr. Vidal, Chief Secretary to Government, and Mr. Reid, Commissioner in Bombay, may be quoted to the effect that there is no reason why the hemp drugs should be cheaper in that Presidency than in other provin- ces; and that of Mr. Rivaz, First Financial Commissioner in the Punjab, that hemp drugs in that province are insufficeintly taxed.
CH. XIV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 289 Question of introducing a Gov- ernment monopoly for hemp drugs discussed. 589. The Commission have considered the question of adopting in respect of ganja, and possibly also of charas, a system of Gov- ernment monopoly similar to the opium excise system. The Bengal Government considered this question both in 1877 and in 1887, and declined to entertain the proposal. In this province there are now several advo- cates of the system, viz.:290 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XIV. final arrangements with the Native States, which, even if ultimately practicable, would take an indefinite time to elaborate, and would probably be regarded by them with disfavour. All, therefore, that the Commission are prepared to say in favour of a Government monopoly is that after full consideration they are unable to dis- cover any well founded objection to it on the ground of public morality, and that in their opinion the Government need not be deterred from adopting it on this ground if the practical objections which have been mentioned above are in regard to any part of British India either at the present or at any future time deemed to be of less weight than the Commission have attached to them. Supervision by Government of India necessary. 590. But while opposed to this amount of interference, the Commission feel strongly that a regulating influence is necessary, and should in future be exercised by the Government of India over the various systems of administration of the excise on hemp drugs which prevail in the different provinces and in the Native States. A standard of administration and taxation is essential to the proper treatment of the whole subject. Existing differences are so great that it will take time to bring about any measure of uniformity, but the Commission, as will be shown hereafter, have found no reason for maintaining the present inequalities, and no serious obstacle to the gradual harmonizing of the different systems.
CHAPTER XV. EXISTING SYSTEMS DESCRIBED. Systems of excise in the various provinces. 591. The various systems of excise administration obtaining in the different provinces have been described in the memoranda which are published in Vol. III Appendices. A brief notice of these systems will be reproduced here, and the question how far they fulfil the conditions of the policy above noted will then be discussed. Bengal. Law in force. 592. The law in force in Bengal is contained chiefly in the Bengal Excise Act, VII of 1878, and rules passed thereunder. The principal provisions are as follows:292 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XV. or admixture of the same, manufactured in any part of British India beyond the territory to which the Act extends may be imported, and, where no duty has previously been paid on such articles, the conditions under which they may be imported and bonded within such limits (section 19-A). The Collector may, with the sanction of the Board, let in farm the duties leviable on the abovementioned drugs, or any of them, in any district or division of a district (section 20). The Board may prescribe rules for the invitation and acceptance of ten- ders for such farms, for the requisition of security for the due fulfilment of the engagements entered into by the farmers, and as to the form and conditions of the lease. The Board may regulate the form and conditions of all licenses grant- ed under the Act (section 28). The Board may frame rules for the grant of licenses or passes to persons purchasing, transporting, or storing ganja, charas, or bhang for the supply of the licensed vendors of those drugs, and may place the cultivation, preparation, and store of such drugs under such supervision as may be deemed necessary to secure the duty leviable thereon (section 35). Manufacture not defined. 593. With reference to the above provisions, the Commission observe that there is no definition in the Act of "manufacture," and that, apart from the provision relating to pos- session, the collection of bhang from the hemp plant, which hardly comes under the designation of "manufacture," does not appear to be prohibited or con- trolled. The system in Bengal: Rajshahi ganja. 594. The system which has been elaborated under these provisions of the law will now be briefly described. Though the hemp plant grows spontaneously in many districts of Bengal, this fact does not seem to affect the ganja administration to any great extent, as ganja, except of a very inferior sort, cannot be manufactured from the wild plants. Culti- vation of the hemp plant for the production of ganja is only allowed in an area of about 64 square miles in the Rajshahi Division. Every cultivator has to take out a license for which no fee is charged. Within the area above mentioned, which, for the purposes of ganja administration, is placed under the jurisdiction of the Collector of Rajshahi, though it lies in the three districts of Rajshahi, Dinajpur, and Bogra, applications for licenses are granted, unless there be any valid objection, and remain in force for one working year. The average area of ganja cultivation is 2,220 bighas, equal to 740 acres. What follows is in the words of the Hon'ble D. R. Lyall, C.S.I., Member, Board of Revenue: "The cultivation is inspected by supervisors throughout the period of growth, the areas cultivated being com- pared with the licenses. The cultivator cuts his crop not necessarily under the supervisor's eye, nor does he require to get permission, but he gives 3 days' notice of his intention to cut. The manufacture is done by the raiyat at his own option as to time and place. The supervisors move about and supervise the manufacture as far as they can. Practically the bulk of the manufacture is not completed under the supervisor's eye. When the manufacture is complete, the raiyat carries his produce to his own store under the latter part of rule 11 of section xx of the Excise Manual, page 155, there being no public godown large enough to
CH. XV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 293 receive the whole crop. A license is given to the raiyat describing the quantity and kind of ganja he is allowed to store, and authorizing him to keep it until he disposes of it to a licensed purchaser. The amount is arrived at by the super- visors by inspection of the crop after manufacture and the number of bundles into which it is manufactured. The crop is made up by the raiyat into 2-sr bundles, and by long practice the measurement is wonderfully exact, though it is done by guess. The raiyats' store is generally situated close to his manufacturing ground. The wholesale dealer comes to the mahal armed with a license from the Collector of his own district giving the amount he is authorized to export. He makes his own arrangements with the raiyats, visiting any store he likes, and, as far as I know, unaccompanied by a supervisor or any excise officer. Having made his bargain, the dealer brings the ganja to the Government gola, where it is weighed, and the sale recorded on the back of the raiyat's license as well as in the Government books. No pass is required for the removal of the ganja from the raiyats' store to the Government gola. The dealer's consignment is sealed at the Government gola, and then carried by the wholesale dealer under pass to his gola at the head-quarters or sub-division of the place of import. There it is placed under double lock, one being in the possession of the dealer, and the other in the possession of the Excise Deputy Collector. The wholesale dealer sells to the retail vendor at his own price, and the retail vendor sells to the public at his own price, except in one district, where a maximum limit is imposed under the terms of the arrangement with the monopolist. This district is Cuttack. The right of retail vend is sold by auction." Where the existing practice dif- fers from the rules. 595. The above procedure differs in one important respect from that pre- scribed in the rules issued by the Board, inasmuch as these rules contemplate the storing of the ganja in a public gola, and there is an exceptional provision permitting storage in a private gola, when a cultivator can satisfy the supervisor that he has a secure private place of his own. He is then allowed to store his ganja there subject to periodical inspection by the supervisor or his assistants. There is no public gola for the storage of the crop, hence the exception has become the rule. Garbjat ganja and illicit practices. 596. Ganja is not ordinarily imported from any other British province into Bengal, but ganja grown in the Orissa Tributary Mahals (Garhjat) is imported under passes in small quantities into the districts of the Orissa Division. The rules as to storage and levy of duty on Rajshahi ganja apply mutatis mutandis to Garhjat ganja. Any vendor licensed to retail Rajshahi ganja may sell Garhjat ganja under the same license. The Excise Commissioner states that Garhjat ganja is largely smuggled into Orissa. This subject will be again mentioned further on. With this excep- tion, the growth and trade in ganja in Bengal is fairly under control. The cases of illicit cultivation are few. They are all of a petty description, such as the growing of a few plants (very often only a single plant) in the courtyards of houses more for the purpose of using the leaves as bhang than for manufac- turing ganja. Cases of unlicensed sale of ganja, though comparatively numerous, generally represent sales of the excised drug by petty dealers who have obtained their supplies from licensed vendors, and often occur from the licensed shops being too few to supply the local demand. The system in force in the Ganja 74
294 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XV. Mahal in the Rajshahi Division gives some opportunity for illicit disposal of the ganja, partly owing to the inadequacy of the supervising staff, and partly to the storage arrangements above mentioned; but the principal authorities are of opinion that very little smuggling actually occurs. Mr. Lyall, while admitting that the facility afforded for smuggling constitutes the weak part of the Bengal system, gives the following reasons for his belief that it does not exist to any extent: "One at least is that I have never come across a case of smuggled ganja, though cases of opium smuggling are not uncommon. The safeguards against illicit practices are the concentration of the area of growth and the crop estimate made by the supervisors when the crop is on the ground. The bulkiness of ganja is an additional safeguard as compared with opium. We have never within my knowledge discovered a cultivator disposing of his crop illegally. Of course, if there were collusion between the protective establishment and the cultivators, this safeguard would be of little use; but, as a fact, I believe the establishment is trustworthy." Charas. 597. Charas is not made in Bengal. A very small amount is imported from Upper India under passes, and after paying duty is sold by licensed vendors. Bhang. 598. There is no licensed cultivation of the hemp plant for production of bhang in Bengal. Bhang is either imported from the North-Western Provinces or collected for the market from the spontaneous growth which abounds in Bhagalpur and in dis- tricts north of the Ganges, especially Monghyr and Purnea. It has been observed above that this collection of the leaves hardly comes within the term "manufacture," and no license is, therefore, legally necessary for the process. But legal possession of bhang, except by licensed persons, is limited to 1/4 sr, hence all transactions of any importance require a license. On the other hand, there is no restriction on the use of the hemp plant in its green state. It is only when prepared to be used, stored, or sold as a narcotic or stimulant that it comes under Excise rules. Passes are required for the purchase or obtaining of bhang for export to another district, or for sale, which must be accompanied by a license from the Collector of the district into which the bhang is to be conveyed, or in which it is to be stored. The rules for storage are similar to those for ganja, and a small duty is levied when the bhang is removed from the warehouse to be taken to the shop for retail sale. The extensive growth of the plant in the districts above mentioned renders control of transactions in bhang very difficult, and it is certain that the amount brought to record and dealt with under Excise rules does not by any means represent all the bhang consumed in Bengal. "The use of untaxed bhang," says the Excise Commissioner, "is general." In January 1893 orders were issued by the Excise Commissioner with the object of extirpating the spontaneous growth of the plant, and thus bringing bhang under more efficient excise control; but the orders were cancelled by the Bengal Govern- ment in the following June on the ground that the attempt was impracticable, and likely to have no result except petty oppression. There is therefore practically little control over the production and use of bhang in Bengal; and although the revenue from excise bhang has increased considerably, this is mainly owing to the fact that the duty is very low and not worth evading on the part of the licensed vendors.
CH. XV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 295 Wholesale vend. 599. The Act is almost silent on the subject of wholesale vendors. The agency by which the retail vendors are sup- plied has grown up from the exigencies of the case. Every wholesale vendor must rent one of the warehouses provided by Government for storing ganja, or must provide one to the satisfaction of the Collector who grants the license. Where warehouses are provided by Government, the Commissioner determines the number of private warehouses, if any, to be licensed. The number of wholesale dealers in any place must not exceed the number of Government and licensed warehouses. Where the number of applicants exceeds the number of Government warehouses, the leases of the latter are put up to auction. These middlemen reap large profits, and to a large extent control the market. They very often combine the functions of retail vendor with those of wholesale vendor. Mr. Price, Collector of Rajshahi, says of them that they superintend the manufacture of the ganja to suit their own tastes, and practically become the owners of the ganja without assuming the responsibilities that devolve on them. He says that their absence from the ganja tract would itself cause the decline of the cultivation. Out of this state of things another class has arisen in the ganja brokers. These men negotiate for the sale of the standing or manufactured crop to wholesale vendors. Forms of licenses to ganja brokers and wholesale vendors have been issued by the Board. Retail vend. 600. For the retail vend of ganja, charas, and bhang separate licenses are issued. There is no restriction as to the price at which the drugs are to be sold to the public. The number of shops is fixed by the Collector according to the demand for the drug. The licenses are sold by public auction for one year. Notwithstanding occa- sional fluctuations, the number of ganja shops has been reduced in the last 20 years from 4,398 to 2,672. The number of charas shops decreased largely down to 1889-90, since when there has been an increase, but not nearly to the former figure. The number of bhang shops has been more stationary. Consumption on the premises is not prohibited. There is no restriction as to the persons to whom the drugs may be sold. Local opinion is not ordinarily consulted regarding the establishment of shops, but attention is paid to any reasonable objection raised against any particular site. Taxation. 601. The revenue from hemp drugs in Bengal is realized in the form of direct duty and license fees for the right of retail vend at a fixed shop only. The duties per sr levied on the drugs warehoused are as follows:296 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XV. except in the case of charas, half the duty on which is levied at the time of taking out the pass for the importation of the drug. The importance of the ganja traffic in Bengal may be gathered from the fact that in the year 1892-93 1,510 maunds were exported to other provinces and 5,451 maunds paid duty, amounting to Rs. 12,80,631. The license fees for retail sale of ganja amounted to Rs. 11,05,435 in addition. The total revenue from charas, of which only 11 maunds 26 srs paid duty, was Rs. 9,097, and from bhang, of which 1,033 maunds paid duty, Rs. 53,558. Assam. Law in force. 602. The law in force in Assam is the same as in Bengal, and the Bengal Excise Manual is followed. Supply of the drugs. 603. There is no licensed cultivation of hemp for the production of the drugs. Excise ganja is supplied from Bengal under pass, and pays duty in the province. The vend of charas and bhang is practically forbidden, as no licenses for their sale have been taken out. Wild hemp grows spontaneously in many parts of the province, and especially in the hill tracts. The offi- ciating Excise Commissioner says: "There is nothing to show that the trade in the wild plant is sufficiently large to compete seriously with excise ganja, unless possibly in the Khasi Hills, where the continuous decrease in the consumption of the Rajshahi drug can, I think, only be attributed to the cheapness of wild hemp and the great facilities for its use. The excise administration of the district is attended by abnormal difficulties owing to the fact that the Khasi Hills are parcelled out into the territories of many semi-independent chiefs. The wild plant is used by habitual consumers only as a pis aller, and when their supply of the excise ganja runs short." This view is not shared by the Excise Commissioner, Mr. Driberg, who says: "Ithink this so-called wild hemp affects our revenue very considerably. It is used by certain consumers, and is also mixed by vendors with excise ganja and sold." Mr. Driberg states that he does not think there is any such thing as wild ganja. As a rule the plant is found in lands occupied by the owner's homestead. From this he infers that the growth is very ordinarily surreptitious. He thinks that the practice of Deputy Commissioners in treating this growth as unlicensed cultivation differs considerably. A circular issued by the Chief Commissioner in October 1882 contains a ruling which appears to be the cause of this diversity of practice. The concluding portion runs as follows: "You will observe that in rule 2, section 17, of Chapter XV, of the Board's Rules it is said that 'no restriction is imposed on the use of the hemp plant in its green state for medical or other purposes, or on its manipulation for the manufacture of fibre. But any preparation of the plant to be used, stored, and sold as a narcotic or stimulant is prohibited except under the rules framed by the administration.' This rule mentions the medicinal use of the plant only 'in its green state;' but if, as appears to be the case, the wild hemp is also used for medicine for cattle when dried, the Chief Commissioner desires that the rule may be liberally interpreted, and no penalty imposed when it is probable that the cultivation or the drying and storing of it was only for this purpose. Whether this is so or not is a question of fact." Mr. Driberg, whose experience of Assam is unique, does not believe that the plant is used to any
CH. XV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 297 extent for cattle. He thinks that it is a mere excuse made by those who really want to use it. He thinks the circular was unnecessary, and issued on insufficient information. The subject is discussed in Chapter X. System of vend and taxation. 604. The system of vend is the same as in Bengal. The amount of ganja which paid duty in 1892-93 was 620 maunds, repre- senting duty to the sum of Rs. 1,39,545. License fees amounted to Rs. 1,64,088. North-Western Provinces. Law in force. 605. The excise on hemp drugs in the North-Western Provinces is adminis- tered under Act XXII of 1881 and rules thereunder. The principal provisions of the law are as follows:298 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XV. apply to the sale of their bhang by owners of spontaneous produce. Restriction, therefore, only operates when the cultivator sells his produce, and there is prac- tically little, if any, check on the supply of the drugs produced in the province. The Excise Commissioner states that ganja of fair or good quality can be made, and is made locally. Charas is produced to some extent in Kumaon; and as the hemp plant grows abundantly in all the montane and submontane districts, bhang can be produced to any extent. Imports of the drugs. 607. The ganja consumed in the province is mainly derived from Bengal, the Central Provinces, Gwalior, Bundelkhand, and, in small quantities, from Nepal and Indore, possibly also from Rewah. Where the production of this ganja is under excise manage- ment, these imports are of course subject to such management. The importers of ganja and bhang are said to be all contractors holding licenses for the sale of the drugs. Charas is brought by Punjabi traders, who sell to the contractors. These traders take out no licenses, and the Excise Commissioner states that the legality of the arrangement is questionable. Some of these traders themselves hold district contracts. Nearly the whole of the bhang consumed is grown in the province. A certain amount is imported from the Punjab, and goes chiefly to the western districts. Notwithstanding the silence of the Act regarding import of the drugs, a rule has been passed that no ganja, charas, or bhang shall be imported into the province except under a pass. No import duty is levied. Transport and export are also made subject to a free pass. Smuggling. 608. The Excise Commissioner is of opinion that the amount of smuggling from outside the province is quite inconsiderable, and this is confirmed by the Hon'ble A. Cadell, the Member of the Board in charge of Excise, and there is no very definite evidence to the contrary. Defect in the North-Western Provinces system of supply. 609. The weak point in the North-Western Provinces system of supply is that the ganja which comes from the different provinces and States abovementioned is taxed before it reaches the frontier at widely different rates, and there is no equalization of this taxation after it has reached the province. Bengal ganja pays from Rs. 6 to Rs. 9 per sr, the Khandwa ganja pays no duty but small fees which may amount to Rs. 2 per maund, Gwalior ganja less than Rs. 5 per maund, and Bundelkhand ganja possibly as much as Rs. 2 per maund. And these different kinds of ganja are freely available under existing regulations to the licensed vendor, who has it in his power to play them off on the consumer in such a way as will best repay him without damaging his credit. In addition to this, the cultivation and manufacture of ganja locally is under no legal control. It is unnecessary to say more on this subject, as the Excise authorities have recorded their opinion that the present system needs reform, and proposals have been made which will be considered further on. System of vend. 610. The right of selling the drugs is farmed to contractors, who are at liberty to procure the drugs wherever they like, and sell them at any price they choose. No dis- tinction is drawn between the different kinds of drugs all are included in
CH. XV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 299 the same license, and are stored by the farmer on his own premises. The contracts are usually for an entire district; in some cases for tahsils or parganas. There is nothing to prevent a contractor having separate contracts for several districts. The ordinary period is for one year, but contracts are now often given for two or three years, and the longer periods always fetch proportionally higher sums. The number and locality of the retail shops is fixed by the Collector subject to the orders of the Board, and is revised from time to time. The contractor either sub-lets the shops or works them through his servants. As a rule he holds the best shops in the large towns in direct management and sub-lets the rest. The con- tracts are sold by auction. The number of capitalists engaged in the trade is not very large, and nothing is commoner among them than combinations to keep down the price. The above account is taken from the Excise Commissioner's memorandum, who adds: "It is a defect in the system that it leaves the whole of the revenue collected here to be determined by the competition of the auctions. The advantages of the system are that a large revenue is very easily and cheaply collected, and that smuggling and other evasive illegal acts are minimized, The contractor has no reason to commit them himself, and it is his interest to detect any one attempting them. This is no small advantage from an adminis- trative point of view. Retail prices are under the existing system kept at the highest possible point." Consumption of drugs on the premises is not prohibited in the shop licenses, nor is there any restriction as to the persons to whom the drugs may be sold. Local opinion is not ordinarily consulted. Mr. Cadell says: "Hitherto the objection to shops has always come from above, viz., from the Board, the Com- missioner, or the Collector." Statistics. 611. The statistics of import and export are very defective. The Excise Commissioner estimates the average imports of ganja and charas as follows:300 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XV. district where they enter the Punjab, and take it for countersignature to the Deputy Commissioner or Collector of every district in the Punjab or the North-Western Provinces which they may enter with the charas. The consignment may be opened at any head-quarters station or tahsil while on its way to its destination, and a portion of its contents may be sold to the farmer of excise for drugs, the fact being recorded on the pass and the package resealed. When a consignment is conveyed by rail, the provision requiring it to be taken to the Deputy Commissioner or Collector of every dis-trict through which it passes is dispensed with. The transport of bhang from the districts of growth to those of consumption is regulated by passes, no duty or fee of any sort being charged. Excise system. 614. Hitherto the excise income from intoxicating drugs in the Punjab has been derived solely from the monopoly of sale within tahsils or other sub-divisions of districts. In some districts the monopoly of opium and other drugs prepared from the poppy is farmed separately from that of the hemp drugs, while in others the same farm includes both. Ordinarily the farm or license is held for the year, the fee payable being determined by auction. The present rules make no provision for the issue of wholesale licenses, but the new rules are to provide for such licenses. As a matter of account the fees paid in each district in respect of the combined opium and hemp drug licenses, where these are held together, are distributed between the two heads of receipt in a proportion which is supposed to represent the actual value of each set of licenses. This proportion varies from district to district. As a result of the practice described above, the number and locality of the shops are fixed before- hand from year to year, and as a matter of fact they are seldom altered. The Punjab system of excise administration in regard to hemp drugs was described by the Excise Commissioner in his report for 1892 as "going very near to reversing the principle of a maximum of revenue with a minimum of con- sumption." In the report for 1893 the Excise Commissioner says: "Taking Rs. 1,70,854 to be approximately the real value of the licenses for the sale of hemp drugs, it represents the total taxation now levied on a consumption of up- wards of 1,000 maunds of charas and of nearly 4,000 maunds of bhang." This is "the weakest part of our excise system in the Punjab. It is hoped that we are now within measurable distance of arrangements which will give us complete control over the import trade in charas, and enable us to impose a duty which can be gradually raised. Owing to the fact that the plant grows wild in so many dis- tricts, and is to be had for the gathering, while charas comes in by a few well recognised routes and can scarcely escape us, it is much more difficult to deal with the trade in bhang efficiently. But I am in hopes that the Government will agree before very long to the introduction of some measures for the direct taxation of bhang too." In the form of license for retail vend of the drugs, there is no provision against consumption on the premises. There is a provision prohibiting the supply of the drugs to any insane person or to children. It may be noted, though the matter is of no practical moment in the Punjab, that the limit of retail sale for ganja is fixed in this form at 1/4 of a sr as for bhang, whereas under the Act it must not exceed 5 tolas. It seems to be the practice to consult the wishes of the people before new shops are opened.
CH. XV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 301 Proposal to tax charas and bhang. 615. The question of imposing a duty on charas and bhang, to which reference is made above, has been very fully dis- cussed, and an Act (X of 1893) has been passed in which power has been taken to impose on any intoxicating drug brought by land from beyond the limits of India into any territory to which Act XXII of 1881 extends, or into any specified part thereof, such duty as the Governor-General in Council thinks fit. In pursuance of the provisions of this enactment, it has been proposed to establish golas to which all charas should be taken on entering the province, and which it should be allowed to leave only under a license or pass, for which a fee should be levied at the rate of 8 annas a sr. The revision of the Excise rules so as to give effect to this proposal is under consideration. The taxation of bhang is a more difficult matter owing to the prevalence of the growth of the plant, and the consideration of proposals relating thereto made by the Excise Commissioner has been postponed until the tax on charas has been introduced. The opinion of the Punjab Government on this question is that "in regard to matters of this sort, which involve an interference with ancient and firmly rooted habits of large masses of the people, it is desirable to proceed cau- tiously, doing one thing at a time." Central Provinces. Law in force. 616. In the Central Provinces Act XXII of 1881 is in force (see North-Western Provinces). Supply of the drugs. 617. In this province, however, advantage has been taken of the provisions of the law to prohibit the cultivation of the hemp plant except under license, and licenses are now only given in the Khandwa tahsil of the Nimar district. The plant does not grow wild, and illicit cultivation has for the most part been suppressed. Charas is hardly known. If imported, it pays a duty of Rs. 10 per maund. No bhang properly speaking is produced, but the refuse ganja is used as bhang. The supply of ganja is amply sufficient for the provincial consumption. Import of ganja from other provinces or Native States is not permitted. There is a certain amount of illicit import from Hyderabad, Berar, Indore, the Bombay Presidency, Gwalior, and the Tributary States of Orissa, and this con- stitutes the principal difficulty of the ganja administration in this province. A little bhang is imported from the North-Western Provinces under passes. Khandwa ganja. 618. The harvesting of the crop in the Khandwa tahsil is supervised by a special establishment, and the cultivators are bound to bring the whole of their produce to a Government storehouse at Khandwa. The drug is purchased at the storehouse by the wholesale vendors of the province, the terms of the purchase being arranged between the cultivators and the wholesale vendors without interference on the part of Government. Wholesale vendors of other parts of British India and foreign dealers are also freely permitted to buy. No direct tax is imposed on cultivation, but the following fees are payable at the storehouse:302 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XV. (2) Permit fees at Re. 1 per maund payable by all purchasers of ganja, other than Government licensed vendors, on account of all ganja for which permission to purchase is granted. (3) Registration fees at Re. 1 per maund payable by all purchasers of ganja, other than Central Provinces licensed vendors, on account of all ganja of which the transfer by sale is registered. Wholesale vend. 619. The sole monopoly of wholesale vend in the province is granted by licenses to wholesale vendors approved by the Excise Commissioner. The licenses are given either for a district or for each tahsil. Tenders are invited annually for the licenses for whole- sale vend, and the tenders must state what fee per sr, in addition to a direct duty of Rs. 2 per sr (except in Sambalpur and the south-east part of the Raipur dis- trict, where it is Re. 1 per sr), the applicants are prepared to pay for the privilege. The wholesale vendor is required to supply the retail vendors with ganja at Rs. 3 per sr (Rs. 2 in Sambalpur and the south-east part of the Raipur district). The ganja purchased by the wholesale vendor is conveyed under a transport pass or import license to a storehouse belonging to the licensee at the district or tahsil head-quarters, one key of which is kept by the Tahsildar, by whom it is issued according to the requirements of the wholesale vendor. Duty is only charged on cleaned ganja, the refuse being destroyed both at the Government storehouse at Khandwa and at the district or tahsil storehouse. Retail vend. 620. The monopoly of retail vend is usually auctioned separately for each shop, except in large towns, where the shops are generally sold to one person. The localities of all shops are fixed by the Deputy Commissioner subject to the control of the Excise Commissioner. All retail vendors are entitled to be supplied with ganja by the wholesale vendor at Rs. 3 per sr, and may charge their own retail price to consumers. The number of shops is regulated by the demand for the drug. In those districts which are specially exposed to smuggling from foreign States, shops are licensed more freely. Every wholesale vendor of ganja is given a license for the retail vend of bhang free of charge. Licenses for retail vend of bhang are not granted to other persons, and no wholesale vendor may import without a written permit from the Deputy Commissioner. A duty of Rs. 2 per sr is levied on all foreign bhang sold, and the rate of sale to the public must not exceed Rs. 3 per sr. Stocks of bhang are kept under control in the same way as ganja. Consumption on the premises is prohibited by a clause in the retail licenses. There is no restriction as to the persons to whom ganja or bhang may be sold. Local opinion as to the opening of shops is not ordinarily taken, but objections, if raised, are considered. Statistics. 621. The average area of ganja cultivation at Khandwa during the past five years has been 785 acres; the average outturn about 8,000 maunds, of which about 5,000 have been exported and 1,000 consumed in the province, the remainder having been destroyed as unfit for sale. The revenue derived from this source has been Rs. 2,18,000, of which Rs. 1,36,500 has been from license fees, and
CH. XV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 303 the rest from fixed duty. There is no revenue from charas, and from bhang only about Rs. 1,000. Madras. Law in force. 622. The Madras Abkari Act (1 of 1886) contains extensive provisions for the control of the cultivation of hemp, and the manufacture, sale, and possession of hemp drugs. But as it has only been brought into force in the Presidency in so far as it relates to the sale of intoxicating drugs, there is no need in describing the system at present in force to refer to any of the other provisions. The principal provisions in force are as follows:304 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XV. of the Act; and generally to carry out the provision of the Act or of any other law for the time being in force and relating to abkari revenue (section 29). No rules have been framed under section 29 and no notifications issued with reference to any of the above quoted provisions of the Act relating to intoxicating drugs except such as relate to the delegation of powers and the extension to local areas of those provisions. Supply of the drugs. 623. The hemp plant does not grow wild in the plains of Madras, and even in the hills there does not seem to be much spontaneous growth. But a few plants will be found in the enclosures of houses in several parts of the province, and there is systematic cultivation of the plant for ganja in the Kistna and North Arcot districts, and to a smaller extent in some others. Accurate information re- garding the area under cultivation is not available, but the amount of regular cultivation accepted by the Commission is 350 acres. From this cultivation ganja is produced and bhang is collected, though statistics of bhang separate from those of ganja are not available, and the bhang of this province is probably in many cases only refuse ganja. Charas is not known. Ganja is said to be imported in small quantities from the Hyderabad, Bastar, and Banganapalle States, and exports made to Ceylon, Mysore, Hydera- bad, and Cochin territory. From other sources it has been ascertained that there is a considerable quantity of Madras ganja smuggled to Burma and Mysore, and that the administration of this branch of excise in the latter tract is thereby rendered difficult. Apart from smuggling, the exports of ganja from Madras to Mysore amounted to 1,829 local maunds (equal to 552 Indian maunds) in 1892- 93. This alone represents a considerable area of cultivation; and, judging from the consumption within the Presidency, it appears probable that the area of cul- tivation has been under-estimated. System of excise. 624. The only system of administration which exists in regard to the hemp drugs consists in the restriction of the sale of these drugs to licensed vendors (with the proviso contained in section 15), and no limit of retail sale having been fixed, any person may purchase any quantity of the drugs from a licensed vendor. Up to 1st April 1891 licenses for sale were granted on payment of fixed fees, and the amount realised from these fees was in the year 1890-91 Rs. 8,805 as compared with Rs. 4,890 the previous year. In 1891-92 the system of sell- ing the licenses by auction was introduced, and the amount realised was Rs. 54,989. In 1892-93 it was Rs. 47,292. The number of shops is determined by the Collector, subject to the Board's approval, and no increase can be sanctioned without the special orders of the Board obtained in each case. No form of license is to be found in the Madras Excise Manual. There are only 246 retail licenses for the whole Presidency, or one shop for 144,781 of the population. The evidence shows that a good deal of the con- sumption does not pass through the shops, and that in certain tracts the drug passes freely from the cultivator to the consumer.
CH. XV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 305 Bombay. Law in force. 625. The system of administration is based upon the Bombay Act V of 1878, and rules and notifications thereunder. The prin- cipal provisions are as follows:306 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XV. Sources of supply in Bombay. 626. The wild plant is not much found in Bombay. There is cultivation of hemp for the production of ganja in a few districts, principally in Ahmednagar and Satara. The aver- age for five years is 874 acres. The cultivator has to obtain a permit, for which no fee is levied, to enable him to dispose of his produce. The Excise Commis- sioner states that the cultivation is noted and watched by the village officers, and he cannot dispose of his crop without obtaining the necessary permit. There is not much evidence of the cultivation of plants in homesteads and enclosures for private use, but Mr. Sinclair, Collector of Thana, alludes to such cultivation as occurring in many private gardens. The amounts of imports of ganja from other provinces given in the statistics supplied by the Commis- sioner of Excise show an average for the last ten years of 1,820 maunds, and that officer in his memorandum states that the imports are chiefly from the Central Provinces. In view of the evidence the figures seem excessive, and a doubt sug- gests itself to the Commission whether imports from district to district have not been included. Charas is imported in very small quantities from the Punjab. Except in the City of Bombay, it is hardly known. Bhang is produced to a small extent in Gujarat and Palanpur. It is imported from Ujjain. The average imports for the last ten years amount to 87 maunds, but not much reliance can be placed on these figures. Probably wherever the hemp plant is grown for ganja, a certain amount of bhang is also produced. Bombay is intersected with a large number of Native States, in some of which ganja is grown. The illicit import of this ganja does not seem to be very extensive, but owing to the cheapness of the drug in these States, and to the high maximum of legal possession (40 tolas), it is inevitable that a certain amount of smuggling should take place, and this is considered to be the case by several witnesses. System of vend in Bombay. 627. The rules provide that the joint privilege of manufacture and retail sale at one or more shops shall be auctioned. The ven- dors are the only importers of the drugs, and there are no wholesale dealers acting as middlemen between the cultivators and the farmers of retail vend. The farmers pay import and transport duties as above described. As a rule the farm of the drugs for a whole district is sold to a single vendor. The retail shops are usually fixed by the Collector. The total number of retail licenses has been very constant for some years, the average for the last ten years being 373. The number of shops, however, is larger, averaging 647 for the last ten years. The form of retail license contains no provision regarding consumption on the premises, nor regarding the persons to whom the drugs may be supplied. There is no fixed rule regarding "local option." In some districts it is attended to carefully. Any representation by the inhabitants would have full consideration, but representations relating to the location of shops are seldom received. Sind. 628. The system of administration in Sind is in almost every respect the same as in Bombay, but there is some difference in the conditions. Neither ganja nor charas are produced, and the consumption of both is not large, though that of the latter
CH. XV.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 307 is nearly, if not quite, equal to that of the former, and is said to be increasing. Ganja is imported from Panvel in Bombay, and charas from the Punjab. There is cultivation of hemp for bhang chiefly in Shikarpur and Karachi, averaging about 300 acres. The annual consumption of bhang is upwards of 4,000 maunds. There is a little smuggling of bhang from the Khairpur State, where it is grown and sold cheaper than in Sind. Aden. 629. Aden is supplied with hemp drugs entirely from Bombay. Berar. 630. The Abkari rules in Berar appear to rest upon the authority of a letter of the Government of India in the Financial De- partment, No. 3541, dated 10th October 1873. Berar is not British territory, and the rules constitute a special local law issued by the Governor-General in Council in virtue of specially acquired jurisdic- tion. Cultivation is prohibited except under license, and Rs. 10 per acre or part of an acre is levied on all cultivation. The area cultivated for pro- duction of ganja is confined to the Akola, Buldana, and Amraoti districts, and amounted in 1892-93 to 85 acres. The village officials are required to destroy any plants of spontaneous growth, and this growth appears to be kept under. Ganja is imported from Khandwa, and sometimes from Khandesh. About 1,300 maunds are consumed annually. Charas is not used. No information is given regarding bhang apart from ganja, and the bhang consumed is probably that produced locally in connection with the ganja cultivation. The monopoly of vend has been hitherto sold by auction to farmers together with that of opium. This is the only taxation besides the rate on cultivation. For the future separate drug shops are to be opened. The maximum amount for retail sale is 20 tolas for ganja and bhang and 5 tolas for charas. There is no limit for legal possession. There is nothing in the nature of local option, but objections to shops are considered. The average retail price of ganja is from Rs. 2 to 2.8 per sr. Ajmere, Coorg, and Quetta- Pishin. 631. In these three small administrations Act XXII of 1881 is in force. There is a little cultivation in Ajmere, but none in Coorg or Quetta-Pishin. The contract system pre- vails, and the monopoly of vend is sold by auction or by tender. The amount realized is the only source of revenue. Shops are licensed, and the drugs are sold at the retailer's prices. Summary of systems. 632. The following is a summary of the prominent features of the excise administration of the hemp drugs in the principal provinces (except Burma):308 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XV. derived from Bengal, Central Provinces, Gwalior, and Bundelkhand. Little smuggling from Native States. Charas imported mainly from the Punjab. A little charas produced in Kumaon and Garhwal, and a small quantity imported from Nepal. Bengal ganja bears the tax imposed in that province. Other ganja and charas hardly taxed. Bhang not con- trolled. Punjab.CHAPTER XVI. PROVINCIAL SYSTEMS EXAMINED. Scope of this Chapter. 633. In Chapter XIV the Commission dealt with the general policy which, in their opinion, should regulate the excise administra- tion in respect of hemp drugs, and in Chapter XV they have described the systems at present existing in British India. They will now offer some remarks regarding the measures necessary to give effect to that policy, and will then proceed to examine the existing systems in the light of these remarks, adding their recommendations where change of any kind seems desir- able. Farm of monopoly of vend not sufficient. 634. The simplest method of dealing with the subject is to farm the mono- poly of vend, leaving the lessee to make his own arrangements for a supply of the drugs and their sale to the public. This is the system (with some slight differences) which is in force in the North-Western Provinces, the Punjab, Madras, Bombay, and the minor administrations. It has the advantage of relieving the Government of all responsi- bility or interest in the matter beyond the disposal of the farms. It secures a preventive agency of a non-official kind for dealing with illicit sale and smug- gling; and if proper care is taken to appoint respectable vendors to prevent combinations for the purpose of keeping down the price of the farms, and to license shops only when they are required by the local demand, such a system may appear to be successful and sufficient. But there are some serious objec- tions to it. In the first place, it has the disadvantage of exercising no control over the production and consumption. Large profits do not depend upon the price being raised to the pitch necessary to check excess; they are as easily real- ised by large sales at low rates. Thus consumption may very probably be un- duly stimulated. Secondly, the Government acquires no accurate information regarding the extent of the production, the sources of supply, and the increase or decrease of the habit of using the drugs. The Commission think it is the duty of the Government to acquire this information. Thirdly, the system leaves the whole revenue and consequent check on consumption at the mercy of com- petition, which is a very unsafe regulator. And, lastly, direct taxation has already been resorted to in some cases with good results, whereas in provinces where only the license system prevails control is insufficient and taxation inadequate. Combination of direct duty with auction of licenses the best sys- tem. 635. In the opinion of the Commission, the combination of a fixed duty with license fees for the privilege of vend constitutes the best system of taxation for the hemp drugs. It is the system which prevails in regard to spiritu- ous liquors produced in India, and is equally applicable to other intoxicants, in regard to which a policy of control and restriction is necessary. Unless there are special reasons to the contrary, the Commission think that the monopoly of vend should be auctioned. The special advantage of doing this lies in the fact that a method is thus secured of adjusting the total incidence of taxation to special circumstances, such as the local demand, the expense of carriage, the facilities for smuggling, the habits of the people, and the price of other intoxicants. 78
310 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XVI. The danger of relying mainly on the auction system as a check on con- sumption is that a combination, or the absence of competition, among the vendors might at any time destroy its efficiency. The fixed duty should therefore be as high as possible, due regard being paid to the considerations mentioned in Chapter XIV, paragraph 586. When this is done, the auction of licenses for vend will come in as a valuable adjustment, and, if properly worked, will indicate whether the limit of taxation has been reached. If the proceeds of the auction sales of licenses have a decided tendency to increase, this will be an indication that the fixed duty will bear an increase. Control of cultivation. 636. But besides that which results from adequate taxation, another method of restricting consumption is available to the Gov- ernment in the limitation of the sources of supply. And the most effective way of doing this, at all events in the case of ganja, is to prohibit cultivation of the hemp plant, except under license, and to grant licenses for cultivation in such a way as to secure supervision and registration of the produce. Unless this is done, it is impossible to have any idea of the extent of consumption. The opinions formed from time to time in regard to this matter in provinces where cultivation is not controlled are mere guesses doomed to be falsified. It is of the greatest importance that this control should be exercised. In regard to charas, the only way of limiting the supply is by taxa- tion, and the conditions of the trade are such that the supply can be completely regulated by the application of this method. Where the hemp plant grows spontaneously in abundance, the supply of bhang cannot be regulated, but in other places there is no reason why its cultivation should not be placed under the same restrictions as that of ganja, and a direct duty, which must be light in proportion to the facilities for importing the drug free of charge, imposed. The subject will be referred to again further on. Limitation of shops. 637. Another most effective way of reducing the sources of supply is by keep- ing the number of licensed shops to the lowest limit compatible with meeting the real demand. The increase of shops or failure to reduce them has often been pointed out as an error committed by individual district officers whose aim was too much to raise revenue. The impropriety of this and its danger cannot be too strongly insisted upon. The matter is one which should be kept constantly in view by the Local Governments and by the Government of India. Artificial checks not desirable. 638. The Commission do not, however, advocate any attempt to restrict the supply of the drugs by an artificial check, such as limiting cultivation of ganja or import of charas, with reference to an ascertained or computed average demand. It is not for the Government to determine how much of the drugs should be consumed. Its func- tion is to exert pressure, but not to fix limits; to regulate the conditions, but not the actual quantity; and it is far better that, subject to those conditions, the laws of supply and demand should not be interfered with. Prices of the drugs. 639. The incidence of taxation in different provinces ought not cCH. XVI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 311 GANJA. CHARAS. BHANG. Minimum. Maximum.

It is "the average retail price in most districts for small quantities of ganja." The maximum must, therefore, be higher. In Jubbulpore, the Commission found that in some shops ganja was selling at Rs. 12 per sr. The maximum for the province is not available. A maximum quotation of 4 annas per tola, equal to Rs. 20 per sr, is given for Ganjam in Madras: this may be Rajshahi ganja. Bhang is said to reach a maximum price of Rs. 10 per sr in the same district. In Malabar, Vellore ganja is said to reach 4 annas per tola, but the maximum price in North Arcot is 4 pies. Wynaad ganja in the same dis- trict is said to reach a maximum price of 2 annas per tola. With these excep- tions, no district shows a higher maximum price than that given in the statement. It is evident that if the systematic treatment advocated by the Commission is to be applied, some means must be taken, especially in regard to ganja, of removing the extraordinary inequalities disclosed by this comparison. Up to year 1892-93, notwithstanding the high price of Rajshahi ganja, the cost of the daily average allowance of liquor to the habitual consumer in Bengal is, according to the memorandum, much higher than in the case of ganja. Judged by this test, there is room even in Bengal for increased taxation. A fortiori is this the case in other provinces except Assam. No doubt the quality of the drug varies in different provinces, but there is nothing in the analysis of the different kinds of ganja which points to such marked discrepancies in the price. And the general conclusion which must be drawn from these figures is that in all the provinces, except Bengal and Assam, taxation is totally inadequate to the due restriction of consumption. The same may be said of charas. As regards bhang, many witnesses are of opinion that there is no need to impose the same restrictions upon its consumption as
312 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XVI. in the case of ganja and charas, and the difficulty of doing so in the Himalayan region is considerable. But the Commission concur with the majority of the witnesses in thinking that the same general principles apply, and that, so far as may be possible, this product of the hemp plant should be brought under more efficient control and taxation. Ganja administration in Bengal. 640. A historical sketch of the ganja administration in Bengal from the year 1790 will be found as an appendix to the Excise Commissioner's Memorandum. From the first the object of the measures taken was "to check immoderate consumption and at the same time to augment the public revenue." Up to the year 1853 hemp drugs were taxed by means of a daily tax on their retail sale paid monthly. From 1824 to 1847 it was usual to farm out the excise revenue of entire districts. From 1853 the daily tax was abolished, and a duty of Re. 1 per sr was imposed. The retail vendor had to pay the full amount on a specified quantity in each month whether he took it all or not. In 1860-61 a fixed fee of Rs. 4 per mensem was levied for each ganja license, in addition to the duty at the prescribed rate, on all quantities passed to the shop for retail sale, the rule regarding the quantity to be taken by each shop being withdrawn. This was the beginning of the combined fixed duty and license fees system which at present exists. In 1876 the system of selling licenses by auction was introduced, and this has continued to the present time. The following table shows the operation of the action taken by the Bengal Government since the time when the auction of license fees was introduced:CH. XVI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 313 Results obtained. 641. This table shows that up to the year 1892-93 on five occasions some increase was made in the rate of fixed duty. The revenue steadily increased, until at the end of the period it was double as much as in 1876-77; notwithstanding this, the number of retail licenses after the first period of six years steadily diminished up to the year 1891-92, though in the following year there was an increase. The result is that the number of the population per retail license increased by 38 per cent. in the whole period. The increase in the total average taxation per sr of the taxed drug increased from Rs. 4-0-2 to Rs. 10-15-1. As regards the area cultivated (column 2), it has to be remembered that these figures represent the growth of the plant for consumption in Assam, the North-Western Provinces, and some Native States as well as Bengal. The figures in column 4 represent the ganja actually consumed in Bengal, which has decreased largely since the first two years, and since then has been nearly stationary. In addition to the above facts, the evidence before the Commission tends to show that, except in Orissa, where the Garhjat ganja competes with the Rajshahi ganja, smuggling does not prevail in any part of the province; also that ganja is still the cheapest form of intoxicant, and that there is no evidence to lead to the belief that it is being displaced in Bengal by more noxious stimulants. The Bengal Government seems to have kept in view with the most successful results the principles which have been enunciated in Chapter XIV, paragraph 586, of this Report as essential to an efficient excise system, and to have intervened, when occasion demanded, to restrict the use of the Rajshahi ganja by administrative control and enhanced taxation. The effect of the enhancements which have been made since the year 1892-93 cannot be gauged, but the Commission have no hesitation in saying that this part of the excise administration in Bengal is being most carefully and ably supervised. Weak points in Bengal system. 642. The weak points in the Bengal administra- tion are314 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XVI. evidence as to extensive smuggling was mentioned as obviating the necessity for the measure. In 1892 the Board were of opinion that the objections to public golas appeared to be insuperable. Mr. Lyall in his evidence says that the storage arrangements can be improved, but that under existing circum- stances it would be impossible without enormous expenditure to have a public gola. Mr. Gupta, Excise Commissioner, says that the "difficulty of having a pub- lic warehouse is that the ganja stored in it would consist of numerous parcels, all belonging to different individuals, and this would lead to much confusion. Again, the drug has to be frequently aired, turned out, and handled in order to keep it in good condition, and it is next to impossible to secure this periodical examination when the ganja is stored in public golas situated at a distance from the houses of the cultivators." He therefore considers the scheme "im- practicable," on which Mr. Lyall notes: "Rather, I would say, too costly." Mr. Price, Collector of Rajshahi, does not recommend public golas because Govern- ment servants would not take care of the ganja as the owners would. But he does not think there would be any great difficulty if there were several Government golas situated in central places, though he does not think the cultivators would view the change with favour. He concludes by saying that he sees no great objection to the plan; and adds: "You cannot have a perfect system without Government golas." Babu Hem Chunder Kerr retains his former opinion in favour of the system, which is also advocated by Ganendra Nath Pal, Sub-divisional Officer, Naogaon, and Abhilas Chandra Mukharji, Excise Inspector. The Com- mission have formed the opinion that the objections are not insuperable, and that the system of Government storehouses should be introduced. The example of the Central Provinces system seems to prove its practicability, and they are of opinion that it would have the effect of bringing about the speedy conclusion of bargains between the cultivator and the wholesale dealer, in which case the main difficulty would be removed. The expense of erecting several godowns should not, in their opinion, operate to prevent the measure considering the very large revenue at stake and the great desirability of removing the existing tempta- tions to illicit dealing. The matter should, however, be left to the discretion of the Local Government. Smuggling in Orissa. 644. The smuggling of ganja from the Tributary States of Orissa into British territory has a long history, and more properly belongs to the general subject of excise administra- tion in Native States, which will be dealt with further on. Reduction of all ganja to chur. 645. The proposal of the Excise Commissioner to abolish flat and round ganja and have only chur is one that deserves notice. He explains rather more clearly in his evidence that what he advocates is not the compulsory production of chur, but the adoption of the chur rate of duty which is the highest for all ganja, which would result in the elimination of stick from the produce, and consequent reduction of the whole stock to chur. There are obvious advantages in having one rate of duty, but other considerations enter into this subject, such as the question as to the form in which the drug can best be packed and transported without deterioration. The experiments which are being conducted in connec- tion with this question are still incomplete. The Commission feel that the matter is one for the Local Government to decide. It is mentioned here because
CH. XVI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 315 it would materially reduce the bulk of the produce and make the introduc- tion of public golas more easy of accomplishment. The plan is also advocated by some subordinate Excise officers and Deputy Collectors. Ganja administration in the Cen- tral Provinces. 646. The present system of ganja administration in the Central Provinces has been in force since 1882-83, previous to which there were several changes, which may be briefly recapitulated. In 1871-72, the first year during which Act X of 1871 was in force, the monopoly of vend of drugs (which included madak) was put up to auction for each district as a whole, or for smaller areas, and knocked down to the highest bidder. The contractors were free to make their own arrange- ments for obtaining the drug from cultivators, and cultivation was free. In 1873-74 the Local Administration had to consider complaints by the retail con- tractors to the effect that the extensive cultivation of ganja for home con- sumption by private individuals seriously interfered with their profits, and prevented them from paying to Government as high a revenue as they other- wise might. Meanwhile the Government of India had issued instructions to all Local Governments to discourage the consumption of ganja and bhang as far as possible by placing restrictions on their cultivation, preparation, and retail, and imposing on their use as high a rate of duty as could be levied without inducing illicit practices. Accordingly, in April 1875, rules were introduced pro- hibiting cultivation except under license, for which the levy of an acreage fee was authorised, and embodying other provisions for inspection of stocks and licenses to cover the possession of the produce until its purchase by the licensed vendor. The acreage fee was fixed soon afterwards at Re. 1, and in 1876-77 a special penal fee of Rs. 10 per acre on unlicensed cultivation was introduced. These acreage fees were, however, pronounced illegal by the Judicial Commissioner in 1878, and new rules were framed providing for the storage of all ganja in Govern- ment godowns or in authorised private storehouses and for levy of duty on the drug when removed. The duty was fixed at Re. 1 per sr. Difficulties were experienced in working these rules, the cultivators not being able to dispose of their produce to the licensed vendors. The wholesale vendors held aloof, feeling uncertain of the effect which the enhanced duty might have on consumption, and the retail vendors would not purchase direct from the cultivators. The Local Administration accordingly purchased nearly the whole crop, amounting to some 6,856 maunds, at a cost of nearly Rs. 50,000. The Government of India, how- ever, objected to the creation of a Government monopoly of ganja; so in 1880-81 the monopoly of wholesale vend for the province was granted to a single indivi- dual, who agreed to pay a duty of Rs. 2 per sr on all ganja sold by him to retail vendors, and to supply them with the drug at Rs. 3 per sr. It was con- templated in the agreement that the price might be raised by increments of 4 annas to Rs. 4 per sr, and the duty by increments of 3 annas to Rs. 2.12 per sr, within the year 1880-81. At the same time the system of auctioning the monopoly of retail vend by circles was done away with, and monthly licenses were issued at fixed rates, varying according to the size of the town or village, and without limit as to the number of licenses existing in one place. This system, however, was abandoned in the following year, and the auction system was again for the most part introduced. This was the origin of the system of monopoly of wholesale which exists to the present time in the Central Provinces. Since 1882-83, by which time Act XXII of 1881 had become law; the wholesale
316 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XVI monopolist has been called upon to pay a certain amount per sCH. XVI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 317 since 1887-88. The local consumption shows a tendency to increase. The number of shops per head of population has on the whole increased; and, although the revenue has increased, this is due partly to increased consumption, and partly to keener competition in the auction sales of licenses. The basis of good administration has been laid, but progress has not been secured, and to this result it is essential that attention should now be directed. Ganja exported to other prov- inces and Native States should pay duty. 649. One important defect of the system is that exported ganja is very lightly taxed. In regard to this subject, the Excise Commissioner in 1887 remarked: "The part played by the Khandwa store as an entrept for the supply of the ganja demand of those provinces (the Central Provinces) is quite insignificant when compared with its use as a mart for the convenience of foreign purchasers. To it throng traders from Bhopal, Indore, Gwalior, Rutlam, Dhar, Jodhpur, Udaipur, Rewa, Panna, Baroda, and other States of less note; and licensed vendors from the North-Western Provinces compete with contractors from Berar for the purchase of the cultivators' stock. Between 6,000 and 7,000 maunds of ganja have on the average of the last four years been annually exported from Khandwa to other provinces and Native States." Since these words were written the permit and registration fees have been imposed, and all the exported ganja pays something before being removed for export. But besides a small fee for storage, Government licensed vendors exporting to the North-Western Provinces or other British provinces only pay Re. 1 per maund by way of registration fees, and foreign purchasers only pay Rs. 2 per maund for permit and registration fees. An instance is here afforded of the necessity of the systematic treatment ad- vocated in Chapter XIV, paragraphs 588 and 590. A large amount of ganja which leaves the Khandwa store is insufficiently taxed, and it is absolutely necessary that arrangements should be made both with British provinces and with Native States to ensure its being adequately taxed in future. Whether the duty should be levied at the place of production or at the place of consumption is a matter of detail: the main point is that it should be levied somewhere before it reaches the consumers. Duty should be raised also on ganja consumed in the province. 650. The Commission cannot regard the possible falling off in retail license fees as any reason for refusing to raise the duty on the Khandwa ganja consumed in the province unless such a falling off produces other consequences detrimental to the Administration. Caution is always necessary in raising the duty lest it should lead to illicit practices, and the circumstances of the Central Provinces require special watchfulness in this respect. The difficulties in the way of increasing the duty owing to the much lower price of the drug beyond the borders of the province are brought out clearly in the Excise Commissioner's memorandum. But making all allowances for these difficulties and for the fact that the Khandwa ganja is inferior to that produced at Rajshahi, the Commission are of opinion that the rate might safely be raised. The system of supplying ganja to retail vendors at a fixed price. 651. The question, however, is one which is intimately bound up with the whole system of monopoly existing in the Central Prov- inces, and this system demands close examination. It has arisen, as has been shown, from special circumstances. Its main features are 80
318 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XVI. that Government interferes at the point where the ganja passes from the wholesale to the retail vendor to fix the price at Rs. 3 per sr, and that the monopoly of wholesale vend is given to a small and selected number of persons who tender for payment of duty at Rs. 2 per sr plus as much of the margin between Rs. 3 and Rs. 2 as can be got from them. There can be little doubt that, apart from the difficulties above referred to, the system itself may have operated against a rise in fixed duty. The interference in the natural operation of the laws of supply and demand has rendered it more difficult for the Government to gauge for itself the necessity for increasing the direct duty. And it may be remarked that, in spite of the fact that the direct duty has not been raised, the receipts from licensed fees have not very materially increased, and therefore, while Bengal has doubled its taxation on the ganja consumed, the Central Provinces taxation has remained stationary. The cause of this may partly be found in the different cir- cumstances of the two provinces. Except in Orissa, the question of smuggling has been set at rest in Bengal. In the Central Provinces the arrangements with the Tributary States which were undertaken with this object have only just been completed, and it may have been considered advisable to postpone any increase in the duty until this should have been done. But even allowing for this, the Commission think there is reason for attributing to the different systems, at all events in part, the widely different results obtained. Advantages claimed for the sys- tem. 652. The advantages claimed for the system areCH. XVI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 319 certain that he recoups himself in many cases by taking out licenses for the retail vend. The system thus encourages a combination of interests which is not generally desirable. The subject is unfortunately not treated in the memorandum, but in Jubbulpore the Commission ascertained that out of 71 retail shops, 20 were held by the wholesale monopolist. The status of the latter is such as to give him practical command of the situation, and the inference is almost irresistible that he will make use of this power to acquire for himself some of the profits attaching to the retail business if dissatisfied with the profits of the wholesale business. Viewed in this light, the limitation of the price may be to a large extent inoperative. Its abolition recommended. 654. Upon the whole it appears to the Commission that any attempt to regu- late the price of ganja otherwise than by a combined system of fixed duty and auction vend of monopoly of retail sale in tracts differently circumstanced is a mistake. It amounts to an interference either too great or too little. A Government monopoly under which, through the agency of Government officers, the drug would be offered to the public at a maximum price would be a simple arrangement. This has been shown not to be the best system for ganja (Chapter XIV, paragraph 589). The alternative is to levy a duty which must be regulated according to experi- ence, the maximum being determined by those general considerations which have been elsewhere explained, and leave the supply unhampered, except by such check as is afforded by the auction of monopoly of retail sale. The latter affords the necessary adjustment for disadvantages pertaining to different locali- ties, such as unusual cost of carriage, facilities for smuggling, etc. If on account of such disadvantages the rate of duty needs to be reduced, there is nothing to prevent the adoption of special rates of duty for particular tracts. In recommending an increase of duty, therefore, on Khandwa ganja, the Commission are prepared also to recommend that the rule under which ganja is supplied by wholesale to retail vendors at a fixed price should be abolished, and that wholesale vendors should not be required to pay fees for their licenses. Storage of ganja and increase in number of wholesale vendors. 655. In one respect the Central Provinces system is more efficient than that of Bengal, viz., the storage of the produce. No difficulty seems to have occurred in these provinces in bringing all the ganja to a central godown at Khandwa. This is probably because the establishment of the godown has obliged the cultivators to come to early terms with the wholesale dealers or their agents. Mr. Robertson, Deputy Commissioner of Nimar, says: "The agents buy up the ganja on their own account as a speculation frequently while the crop is standing. The whole outturn thus passes into the hands of about a dozen men, who are then able to run up the price at the Khandwa storehouse to all except the wholesale vendors, by whom they have been specially retained. The existence of the 'corner' in no way affects the vend of ganja, so far as this province is concerned. The wholesale vendors have to supply the retail ven- dors at Rs. 3 per sr, so that the latter, and through them the consumers, are not affected. But wholesale vendors from other provinces undoubtedly find it difficult to make purchases at Khandwa." The Commission think that a system which leads to the speedy disposal of the crop by the cultivators to the wholesale vendors is desirable, but the monopoly of wholesale vend seems to be in this province in too few hands, whereby combination against a rise of
320 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XVI. duty is facilitated. Subject to the adoption of the measures advocated in paragraph 654, the Commission recommend that wholesale licenses should be more freely granted without charge as in other parts of India, the selection being carefully made by local officers according to requirement. Assimilation of the Bengal and Central Provinces systems. 656. If the suggestions made in paragraphs 643, 649, 650, 654, and 655 of this chapter are accepted, the systems of Bengal and the Central Provinces will be practically assimilated. And apart from the fact that the system advocated appears to possess the greatest advantages, this result is in itself most desirable. North-Western Provinces. 657. The statistics for the North-Western Provinces are regarded by the Excise Commissioner as very defective so far as regards the amount of imports and exports. In the absence of any fixed duty, and with a revenue determined solely by the license fees, no provincial record of the traffic has been kept up. Mr. Stoker is not con- fident that allowance has been made for transfers from district to district, and he thinks there is much risk that the same drugs may have been counted twice, and the provincial total thus exaggerated. Moreover, licenses for the sale of the different kinds of drugs have not been sold separately. All that can be gathered from the statements furnished is that the total amount of the license fees has in- creased by about 75 per cent. in the last 20 years and the number of retail licenses by 50 per cent., and that the imports and consumption of ganja seem to be on the increase. The excise ganja of Bengal is being displaced by the drug from the Central Provinces and Native States, which is almost wholly untaxed, and this is one of the weak points in the North-Western Provinces administration as pointed out in Chapter XV, paragraph 609. The total revenue from license fees is in 1892-93 Rs. 7,04,788, but from this would have to be deducted the amount due to licenses for the sale of charas and bhang which cannot be ascertained. At a rough guess, it may be put at one-third, leaving Rs. 4,70,000 due to ganja. To this must be added the duty on Bengal ganja levied in Bengal (about Rs. 1,12,600) and the registration fees at Re. 1 per maund levied on Central Provin- ces ganja at Khandwa, making a total of about Rs. 6,00,000, or Rs. 3-2-3 per sr on all imported ganja reckoned on an average of 4,774 maunds. On the whole this does not appear to be a very inadequate incidence of taxation, but it must be remembered that there is no control of production in the province, and that the taxation on the different kinds of ganja imported is very unequal. The number of shops is very large, nearly double in proportion to population of that which is found in Bengal. There can be no doubt that in this province more control is necessary, and some measures are urgently required for reducing the taxation of the different kinds of ganja which are brought into the province to some kind of uniformity. The need of remodelling the system has been fully recognised by the officers in charge of the excise, and the proposals of the Excise Commissioner, which have the support of the Member of the Board of Revenue in charge of Excise, include the following measures:CH. XVI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 321 It is also proposed to control the import of ganja, and to impose an import duty at first of Rs. 50 to Rs. 80 per maund on pathar ganja from the Central Provinces and Native States, to be increased by degrees. For this purpose an amendment in the law will be required. Subject to the remarks which will be found further on (paragraph 679), the Commission agree in these proposals. Madras and Bombay. 658. In Madras and Bombay the general opinion among local officers appears to prevail that no changes are necessary, though the Commission have reason to believe that these Governments recognise the impossibility of continuing the present state of affairs in view of general considerations affecting the whole of India. A seizure of 14 maunds 24 srs of Madras ganja imported by sea to Calcutta was made in January 1894. When the Madras Collector of Customs was communi- cated with and asked to enquire full particulars and take action if he considered it necessary, he replied to the Calcutta authorities asking under what law he was desired to interfere. The Madras Act contains full provisions regarding the import and export of drugs; but these provisions have not been extended to the province. In view of the illicit imports into Burma from Madras, regarding which there is ample evidence from the former province, of the complaints from Mysore which are mentioned in Chapter XVII, and of the cheapness of the drug, there can be no doubt that reforms are urgently required. The system in Bom- bay is somewhat more formulated, but in view of the large amount of ganja produced, and the still lower price of the drug in the producing districts, there is no less need of an improvement in the system of administration. The annexed table gives a comparative view of the cultivation and taxation of ganja in these provinces, and in Bengal and the Central Provinces. The only comparison which can be made is that of total taxation per acre of reported cultiva- tion, because the areas of cultivation and totals of taxation are the only figures on which any reliance can be placed in these two presidencies:322 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94 [CH. XVI. The only item which cannot be added is that portion of the North-Western Provinces license fees which is due to the sale in those provinces of Bengal ganja. If this is calculated according to the proportionate amount of such ganja, it would not materially affect the calculation. If a similar calculation is made to determine the amount of the license fees due to the sale of Khandwa ganja in the North-Western Provinces, about Rs. 1,57,000 would have to be added to columns 5 and 6 of the Central Provinces figures, and the result of this will be to raise the average revenue per acre of cultivation in column 7 from Rs. 219 to Rs. 393. Some of the Khandwa ganja also finds its way into Bombay and Berar and other tracts, and pays duty there in the form of license fees; so the average per acre of Rs. 393 is still under the mark, but in any case the taxation thus calculated is very much less than in Bengal. On the other hand, the average revenue per acre for Madras and Bombay is probably over the mark, as the amounts in column 6 represent the license fees paid for all the hemp drugs and not ganja only; and in the sales effected under these licenses is included a certain amount of ganja, at all events in Bombay, imported from other provinces. Against this, however, must be set the fact that both the presidencies export ganja,CH. XVI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 323 In view, however, of the indefinite and uncertain information obtained regard- ing the extent of the traffic in the drug and the limited nature of the consump- tion, the Madras Government came to the conclusion that in most parts of the Presidency no restriction was called for, but remarked that it was prepared to extend the provisions of the Abkari Act relating to intoxicating drugs to limited areas on adequate cause being shown. Experience, however, showed that the demand for the drugs was considerably larger than was suspected, and that the competition in certain districts for the privilege of vend was very keen. Accordingly the licenses for retail vend were sold by auction, with the result that the revenue from this source rose the first year from Rs. 8,805 to Rs. 54,989. No further measures for controlling culti- vation or restricting consumption were taken. The Board again considered the question of limiting the legal possession of the drug, which had been advo- cated by the majority of the Collectors, but came to the decision that restrictions on the cultivation of the plant should precede those on possession, and their objections to revising the idea of licensing cultivation appear to have been (a) that this would involve the taking out of a license by every person who had a plant or two in his garden; and (b) that it would have been necessary to make a large increase in the number of shops in order to meet the legitimate demands of consumers. It is not clear why the Board changed their views regarding pro- hibition of cultivation which they had previously recommended. And the num- ber of shops existing in Madras is under the existing arrangement manifestly in- adequate, being one for every 144,781 of the inhabitants. Considering that the consumption of the drugs in Madras is found to be much larger than was sus- pected, and that the propriety of introducing more control into the admin- istration has for several years been recognized, the Commission are of opinion that the needed reforms should be no longer delayed. Treatment of the subject in Bombay. 661. The system in Bombay, which was introduced in 1880, does not seem to have been brought under discussion since that time. The Commissioner of Excise states that the subject attracted little attention till the Commission was appointed. The Com- missioner of the Northern Division says that the system seems to have grown up in a haphazard way. The subject has been treated mainly from the revenue point of view, and the control exercised has not been strict. At the same time the area of regular ganja cultivation in Bombay seems to be considerably larger than in any other province; and if measures with a view to restriction in con- sumption are necessary anywhere, they certainly appear to be so in this Presi- dency. Control of cultivation for ganja. 662. The Commission on a full review of the whole circumstances con- nected with the ganja administration have framed the opinion that cultivation of the hemp plant for the production of narcotics in Madras and Bombay should be prohibited except under license, and that the licensed cultivators should be restricted to a limited area as in Bengal and the Central Provinces. They are of opinion that no greater difficulties exist in this respect than have been already overcome in these provinces. A few remarks are offered in justification of this view.

Evidence relating to control of cultivation in Madras. 667. It will be desirable to analyse the evidence on this point in both presi- dencies. Several witnesses in Madras speak of the needlessness of controlling cultivation, but on this point it cannot be expected that they should take a sufficiently wide view, as the interests at stake are larger than those of individual districts. The only wit- nesses who consider the measure impossible are326 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XVI. the Hon'ble Rai Bahadur Sabapathy Mudeliar, Raja K. C.

In Bombay, though several witnesses say that further control is un- necessary, three of whom are under the impression that licenses are already required for cultivation, there is no opinion adverse to its restriction on other grounds. The following officers see no serious objection to restriction of cultivation:CH. XVI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 327 indicate that there is room for taxation to regulate the wholesale rates of the drug." Mr. Vidal says: "In view of the higher taxation in other provinces, I see no reason why there should not be a higher direct tax in this province. The disproportion between the taxation of liquor and of hemp drugs, and the relative dearness of liquor which results from this, also points to the propriety of increasing taxation on hemp drugs." Mr. Monteath, Col- lector, says: "I think the present system of excise administration in respect of hemp drugs has worked fairly well, but that the time has come for putting these drugs on the same footing as alcoholic stimulants and opium. Hitherto the consumption of preparations of hemp has not been extensive, and so long as it was very small, the farm of the right to sell, as dispensing with the need of any preventive establishment, was perhaps more suitable. But it seems that not only in this district (Bijapur), but throughout the Presidency, the amounts bid for the right to sell have been increasing, and it may fairly be inferred that the habit of consuming these drugs is spreading. It cannot, indeed, be said yet to be prevalent; still the total consumption is, I think, sufficient to make it worth while to impose an excise duty; it is already in this district much in excess of the consumption of opium, though insignificant as compared with the consumption of alcoholic stimulants, particularly toddy. It is, I believe, generally admitted that the system of deriving a revenue by farming the right to sell is suitable only in the earliest stage, and that the levy of an excise duty is the fairest and most satisfactory method of taxing an article produced in the country. Now the levy of an excise duty on preparations of hemp will pre- sent no difficulties in this Presidency. The existing abkari establishments would probably suffice for the levy of the duty, or at least would require strengthening to but a small extent. The levy of an excise duty would not, I think, excite any opposition. An alteration in the form of duty could not reasonably be objected to." Mr. Ebden, Collector, says: "The hemp drugs are very much cheaper than liquor now. For a pice a man can get enough ganja to last him for a week if he is a moderate consumer. There is, therefore, considerable margin for heavier taxation of the drug without driving the people to liquor or other intoxicants. I consider there is a considerable margin for taxation, though the drug is con- sumed by the very poor. I have no sympathy with the excessive consumer, and the moderate consumer would not feel a moderate increase." Mr. Sinclair, Col- lector, says: "I consider there is a margin for increasing taxation, having regard to the price of other intoxicants, the fact that the drugs are mainly used by the poor, and the danger of smuggling." Mr. Almon, Assistant Collector, Bombay, says: "My impression is that the tax on the drugs is too low. I think that the ordinary liquor consumer pays twice as much for what he wants as the ordinary ganja consumer would, or three times as much as the ordinary bhang drinker. I think the rates should be equalized." Other advocates of increased taxation are three Deputy Collectors, the Administrator of the Jath State, an Assistant to the Commissioner, an inamdar, a mamlatdar, a pleader, and a drug farmer. Recommendations regarding taxation of ganja in Madras and Bombay. 671. In view of these opinions, as well as of the general considerations which have been explained above, the Commission have no hesitation in advocating the gradual assi- milation of the Madras and Bombay systems to that in force in Bengal. The process of arriving at adequate taxation must necessarily be gradual, but a commencement should be made without any further delay.
328 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XVI. The present is the time for this measure, while consumption of ganja is still believed by the authorities to be very limited. It cannot but be the case that the enormous difference between the taxation of liquor and ganja is an incen- tive to the increase in the drug habit, and such an inconsistency between the arrangements of different provinces and the administration of the excise on dif- ferent kinds of intoxicants cannot, in their opinion, be any longer maintained. Berar. 672. In Berar the foundation has already been laid for the introduction of a system of control in respect of ganja similar to that advocated by the Commission. Cultivation is already restricted and an acreage duty imposed on its growth. The Commis- sion are not aware of the conditions under which this has been found possible. The law of the province stands on a special footing, as previously explained. The Commission believe that there will be no difficulty, and there certainly will be some advantage in assimilating the system to that which exists in the Central Provinces, and which may ultimately be adopted in Bombay. Ganja is inade- quately taxed, and it is unlikely that the pitch of taxation necessary to restrict the consumption can be reached otherwise than by a direct duty, or that a much heavier acreage duty will effect the desired object. Ajmere, Coorg, and Quetta-Peshin. 673. Not much need be said of the other minor administrations. Progress in Ajmere must depend upon co-operation with the British system in surrounding States. Ultimately it is probable that the system can be assimilated to that in force in the rest of British India. In Coorg the price of ganja is very low owing to the facility of obtaining a supply from the Madras Presidency. When the system of the latter is revised, care should be taken that similar restrictions in Coorg are not wanting. Quetta-Peshin hardly requires special notice. The consumption of ganja must be very small, if it exists at all, as the sources of supply are very distant. The retail price stated to prevail is higher than anywhere else in India except Bengal and Assam. Taxation of charas. 674. As the only province which receives large imports of charas, the Pun- jab is primarily concerned with the administration of this drug. Hitherto there has been no taxation of charas in the Punjab beyond the levy of license fees for its vend. It is not used in Assam, Madras, Berar, and Coorg, and but little in Bengal, the Central Provinces, and Bombay. It is used in the Punjab, the North-Western Provinces, Sind, and Quetta-Peshin. Bengal levies a duty of Rs. 8 per sr on the small amount imported, and the Central Provinces Rs. 10 per maund. In Bengal, Mr. Gupta says that it will be necessary ere long to raise the duty. The import duty in Bombay is 8 annas per maund. In the other provinces the only tax is, as in the Punjab, that which is represented by the license fees for vend. Bengal is, therefore, the only province where the taxation is adequate. In the North-Western Provinces it is proposed to levy a duty of Rs. 80 to Rs. 100 per maund on all charas imported. In the Punjab, in pursuance of the provisions of Act X of 1893, a duty of Rs. 20 per maund has been proposed. This appears very small. The conditions under which the trade in charas from Yarkand is carried on operate to some extent against more severe taxation. But if provision is made to prevent the tax from being demanded from the actual importers, the Commission are of opinion that there is ample room for taxation without the trade
CH. XVI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 329 being seriously affected. There is a large amount of responsible evidence for taxing the drug in the Punjab and the North-Western Provinces, where the consumption is far greater than elsewhere, and the Commission think that Rs. 80 per maund is not too high to begin with. Ultimately, regard being had to the consideration above noted, the taxation might be raised considerably. Transport of charas and inter- provincial arrangements. 675. As the supply of charas is so completely within the control of Gov- ernment, it is not necessary to say much regarding its disposal. The establishment of bonded ware- houses, to which the drug can be taken on arrival, and from which it shall be issued only on payment of duty by the licensed vendors, has already been decided upon in the Punjab. This measure will relieve the importers from having to pay the tax in anticipation of sales, and consignments from these warehouses will be sent under pass to the different centres of consumption. The Commission do not think it necessary that the whole duty leviable under provincial arrangement should be demanded when these consignments are removed. The bonded ware- house system may be again resorted to by Local Governments which desire to impose further taxation locally. But as from time to time the Punjab Govern- ment will, no doubt, find it possible, with reference to political considerations, to enhance the duty, it will be desirable that there should from the first be an under- standing as to the relative claims of the importing province and the consuming province to the duty realized. A similar question has arisen regarding the Raj- shahi ganja exported to other provinces, and the procedure has not been uniform. This is one of the cases in which the intervention of the Supreme Government is needed for the settlement of inter-provincial arrangements and of arrangements between British provinces and Native States. It may be necessary to amend the Act in order to carry out the above suggestions. For although section 23-A of the Act provides for the imposition of duty on the imported drug without specifying where it should be paid, section 36 (d) lays down that the bringing of it into British India without payment of the prescribed duty is an offence. The matter is under the consideration of the Local Government. It is essential that arrangements should be made for taxing charas not at the frontier, but at the bonded warehouses. Control of bhang. 676. The difficulty of controlling bhang in Bengal, Assam, the North-Western Provinces, and the Punjab arises from the fact that there is large spontaneous growth in the mountainous and submontane tracts of these provinces. There is undoubtedly a belt of growth which precludes strict control. But in parts of these provinces away from the hills there is little or no spontaneous growth, and in these parts as well as in the other provinces control is possible. There is a little cultivation in the Punjab and the North-Western Provinces, and considerably more in proportion in Sind. None of this cultivation is in the Himalayan region, where the wild growth exists. With the exception of Bengal and the Central Provinces, the only taxa- tion is that realised by auction vend of the monopoly of sale. In Bengal a duty of 8 annas a sr is levied on all bhang brought to the storehouses under Govern- ment supervision, which represents but a small fraction of what is illicitly con- sumed. Without controlling the spontaneous growth of the plant, it has been found impossible to raise the duty, though the subject was fully considered in 1889-90. In the Central Provinces a duty of Rs. 2 per sr is levied on foreign 83
330 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XVI. bhang, which operates to prevent the imports from passing a very limited figure. The taxation of this bhang is excessive, and its sale is affected by the fact that only the wholesale dealers are allowed to sell it by retail. Recommendations for its control and taxation. 677. The Commission are in favour of taking such measures as are possible for controlling and taxing bhang. For the present they consider that in the belt of growth above re- ferred to nothing more can be done than to auction the monopoly of retail vend. In other parts they are of opinion that cultivation should be prohi- bited, except under licenses, and arrangements made for the transfer of the whole crop produced from licensed cultivation to the authorised vendors. In these tracts they are of opinion that some attempt may be made to extir- pate the spontaneous growth by rendering the occupiers of land responsible that it shall not be found on their lands. Legislation may be necessary for the purpose. They would like to see Mr. Westmacott's circular which was cancelled by the Bengal Government revived, and they would suggest a modification of the Assam circular permitting the use of green or dry hemp for the use of cattle. Now that the habitat of the spontaneous growth has been clearly defined, Local Governments will have no difficulty in deciding where, for the present at least, the existing system must be allowed to continue. The Commission think that it may be impossible to treat the bhang which is pro- duced in ganja-growing tracts in a different manner from ganja. To do so would probably be to imperil the ganja administration. But if this opinion is found to be mistaken, they would be glad to see this bhang more leniently treated than ganja. The Commission find that in the Central Provinces bhang is only per- mitted to be sold by the wholesale vendors, and the duty is the same as in the case of ganja. The reason for this is not apparent. As judged by the stand- ard of other provinces, the incidence of taxation is high compared to ganja. Distribution of the hemp drugs to retail vendors. 678. As regards the distribution of the drugs to retail vendors, the Commis- sion think that when adequate arrangements have been made for their taxation, not much interference is required. The evidence contains various suggestions on this subject. Some witnesses point to the large profits reaped by whole- sale vendors, and suggest that these middlemen should be abolished, and that the functions discharged by them should be assumed by the Government in order that these profits may be secured for the public revenues. The Commission are not in favour of this proposal. It is open to some of the objections against a Government monopoly which have been previously stated. If the profits reaped by the wholesale vendors are found to be excessive, this fact would point to a rise in the duty. If the latter is sufficient, the Government need not concern itself with the dealers' profits. Private enterprise is, moreover, better suited for the distribution of the taxed drugs than Government agency. The aim of Gov- ernment should be to dissociate itself, as far as possible, consistently with efficient control and adequate taxation from the supply of the drugs. This general policy may admit of special exceptions. The Bengal Government has made pro- vision for such exceptions, while affirming the general principle, in the following rule*:CH. XVI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 331 or drugs are supplied by the producer or wholesale dealer to the retail vendor, or by the retail vendor to the consumer," In the Central Provinces the price at which the wholesale vendor is to supply the drugs to the retail vendor has been fixed for all districts, and the subject has been already consider This is not done elsewhere in British territory, and any deviation from the ove- stated principle seems to the Commission to require special justificatio. Theprivilege of wholesale vend should not be too restricted. This will res in greatvariations of the prices paid by consumers owing to the absence of ompetition. In Assam the "effect of farming the monopoly of a whole dist to a singleperson has been found to result in very high prices even were smuggling is known to exist," and this should be obviated if possible freer competi- tion in regard to the supply. If this fails, special arrangeme may be required for keeping the price at a reasonable figure. Import, export, and transport duties. 679. In some provinces import, export, and transport duties are levied; and this practice is not unmmon in Native States. This practice arises fr the want of uniformity which exists in the systems of administration. It s attended with considerable difficulties, and serves no useful purpose in itself. If all the drugs were adequately taxed at the sources of supply, subject to such additional taxation as local circumstances demand, the amount of which is best determined by auctioning the licenses for vend, there would be no ned for such duties at all. As a supplementary means of taxation, where these requirements are not fulfilled, it may be necessary in special cases to maintain them. This must be the case, at all events for some time to come, if drugs are imported from Native States into British territory. But, if possible, such imports should be entirely prohibited, unless the State concerned has assimilated its system to that in force in British territory. Transport duties from one place to another in British territory should be entirely abolished as soon asadequate taxation of the drugs at the source of supply has been provided for. A system of free passes to licensed persons is all that is needed. Partil measures of this kind tend to obscure the real issue, viz., how far consumption needs to be checked by a rise in duty. Retail vend. (a) Separation of licenses for different kinds of drugs. 680. The system of retail vend differs largely in the different provinces. In some places the licenses for retail vend of the drugs are held by the same persons and under the same contract as licenses for the sale of opium without any attempt to discriminate the amount of fees due to each. More frequently the licenses cover the sale of all kinds of hemp drugs, and the relative demand for the different kinds is not ascertainable. Where the demand is small there may be reasons for maintaining the latter system, but the hemp drug licenses should, in the opinion of the Commission, be distinct from all others, and in most cases it is desirable that the licenses for the different kinds of hemp drugs should also be distinct; for it is not the desire of Government that a demand for any of the drugs should be created. Shop licenses should only be given where the demand exists, and there may be a demand for one kind and not for another. The demand for a bhang license, for instance, should not be responded to by licensing the sale of ganja or charas in addition, which may not be necessary. As a rule the licenses should be sold separately. As Mr. Stoker says: "This would enable us to provide for the sale of the more harmless
332 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XVI. forms of the drugs without the others, and to meet the demand for one form without allowing the sale of the other forms of the drug." (b) Separate sale of shops. 681. As to the question whether the licenses for different shops should be sold separately or collectively for any given tract, the Commission are not prepared to generalize. The latter system affords a better guarantee for the respectability of the licensee, and has the mt of simplicity. But where auction bids are affected by combina- tions, the separate system may be desirable. The matter is one that must be left to the discretion of Local Governments and Administrations. (c) Grant of retail licenses towholesale vendors. 682. The Commission are averse, as a rule, to the grant of retail licenses to wholesale vendors, and there is a good deal of evid- ence against the practice. It is not desirable to insist on the wholesale vendors becoming also the retail vendors, and diversity of practice tends to produc complications. If both functions reside in the same person, he has too extensiv a monopoly, and will command the market to an undesirable extent. It cannot be too strongly insisted upon that uniformity and simplicity of system are essential to providing the means for ascertaining whether the drugs are sufficiently xed; and when some of the shops are held by the wholesale vendors, and others by separate retail vendors, it is more difficult to gauge accurately the effect of the system. At the same time the Commission are aware that the practice of allowing wholesale vendors to hold retail licenses is very general, and they are unable to recommend that it should be authoritatively put a stop to. The subject is one which they would commend to the notice of Local Governments with reference to the above remarks. (d) Licensing of shops. 683. A separate license should be granted for each shop. This is ordinarily the practice, but there are exceptions. None should be permitted. The District Officer should watch the auction bids and refuse to renew licenses if they only amount to a nominal figure. The principle should be to supply a real demand, not to create one; and if the demand only exists to a very limited extent, the danger of stimulating it must prevail against the convenience of the very limited number of consumers. The number of the population per retail license in the different provinces in 1892-93 was as follows:[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Survey of India Offices, Calcutta, August 1894. A HEMP DRUG SHOP, BHANG, GANJA, & MAJUM DISPLAYED, KHANDESH.
CH. XVI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 333 The number of shops in Madras is only 246, and the allegation of some of the witnesses that there is no need for shops because the consumers of ganja can get ganja when they require it from the cultivators receives confirmation from these statistics. In Bombay the number of shops is stated to be nearly double the number of retail licenses, and the difference is not explained. The number of souls per shop is only 24,681. No doubt density of population is an element in the consideration, and thinly populated tracts will require more shops proportion- ally than where population is dense; but the number of shops in the North-West- ern Provinces, Punjab, Central Provinces, Sind, and Berar seem to require atten- tion with reference to these remarks. A considerable reduction of shops has been under consideration in the North-Western Provinces which was to come into force in 1893-94. (e) Consumption on the premises. 684. The hemp drug shops in British India are rarely used as smoking re- sorts. They are not unfrequently shops where other articles are also sold. If not, they are generally small and incapable of affording accommodation for a number of persons. Ganja smokers who smoke in company generally congregate in places of public resort or in their own houses. And the evils which result from consumption of liquor on the licensed premises in England may be said to be unknown in connection with ganja shops. There are a few witnesses who in answer to the Commission's question on the subject say that such shops are undesirable; but these remarks are mainly founded on theoretical objections, not on practical experience. In the Central Provinces consumption on the premises has been prohibited since 1891, but there is no information as to the origin of the prohibition. It seems probable, however, that when the prohibition was issued as regards madak and chandu, the clause was made to include the hemp drugs without special inquiry. In the City of Bombay there are two classes of shops334 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XVI. under control to prevent drunkenness. The plan is one which might be tried as regards ganja in cases where its use has any tendency to a similar result. In the Punjab and in Quetta-Pishin the licenses for retail vend have a provision binding the vendor not to sell the drugs to children or insane persons. The sale to children has been noticed by a few witnesses in other provinces, and the Commission recommend the adoption of a similar provision in all such licenses everywhere. Local option: Law regardingCH. XVI.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 335 between classes is such that there is no homogeneous public opinion, if I may use the phrase." Mr. Gupta says local "opinion is not formally consulted, but attention is paid to any reasonable objection raised against particular sites, though most of the sites being old ones, it is seldom that they are objected to. More- over, shops for the sale of hemp drugs are not considered a nuisance, and are often accommodated in the same room where other busins is carried on." In the North-Western Provinces, Mr. Cadell says: "I have never heard of any objec- tions to drug shops. I have heard such objection regarding spirit shops. The wishes of the community should be consulted. Hitherto the objection to drug shops has always come from above, viz., from the Board, the Commissioner, or the Collector." Mr. Stoker's evidence is to a similar effect. In the Punjab, Mr. Gordon Walker says: "There is nothing in the nature of 'local option.' In practice the shop sites remain as they have been established for a long time, and the necessity for a change in the way of adding new shops or closing existing ones seldom arises." It may, however, be noted that there is special provision in the Punjab for inviting the opinion of the residents of a locality regarding the opening of a new liquor shop and holding a local inquiry if necessary. Similarly in the Central Provinces, there is a modified system of local option as regards liquor shops, which are more than six times as numerous as ganja shops, but not in regard to the latter. Mr. Drake-Brockman says that the administration has all along shaped its policy on the assumption that the drug is extremely deleterious, and it is a standing order that no more should be licensed than are necessary to meet the demands of consumers, who, if a licit supply were not available, would probably supply themselves illicitly. Mr. Laurie says: "In an agricultural province like this, the people are not given to formulating their views in speech or writing; and 'public opinion' can only be arrived at by laborious research." In Madras "it has been directed that in cases of alterations in the number or sites of shops in muni- cipalities, a list of the proposed shops with their sites should be forwarded to the Council in sufficient time to admit of its remarks being received and con- sidered; and though in the rural tracts the location of shops is at the discretion of Revenue officers, representations from District or Taluk Boards or Taluk Unions would invariably be received with attention." In Bombay, Mr. Mackenzie says: "There is no fixed rule as to local option. In some districts it is attended to carefully; in others the Collector uses his discretion according to the information he possesses as to the demand; but in all any representation by the inhabitants for or against the establishment of a shop would have full consideration. Such representations, however, have seldom been made." The same is the case in Sind. Mr. James, the Commissioner, says: "No concession of local option in the matter of hemp drug shops has been made, nor is it necessary. Where there is sufficient demand, the farmer applies for a shop, and retailers are all grocers, and the drug forms an addition to their ordinary stock of groceries......A farmer does not, like a publican at home, stimulate sales by accessories calculated to make his shops attractive. He simply depends on the demand. The Collector and District Magistrate, after consulting the local officials, is able to judge whether a shop should be opened or not, and local residents other than the consumers of the drug take no more interest in the matter than a tailor in an English country town in the question whether a particular grocer down the street should have a license to sell claret or not. The subordinate officials whom the Collector would consult before
336 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XVI. deciding......no doubt ask the local zamindars or Hindu mukhi their opinion upon this as upon most matters affecting the peace and comfort of the village. But the matter is too insignificant for any formal rule to be made or to be neces- sary." Other evidence. 687. It is perhaps doubtful what might be the effect of an attempt to canvass public opinion more completely than is at present done. A missionary in Bengal and another in Assam think that local public opinion would close every ganja shop. But Mr. Cockburn, an officer of long standing in the Opium Department, North- Western Provinces, says: "If the wishes of the people were consulted, the number of liquor shops would be at once doubled, and ganja and bhang obtained at every bania's." Mr. Thorburn, Commissioner in the Punjab, takes the same view. A missionary in Madras, who is an advocate of prohibition, says: "I do not see the use of consulting local opinion on such a question. Though public opinion is decidedly against the use of hemp drugs, it is doubtful if the majority of the people would take the trouble to express any opinion on the subject, while consumers of the drug would certainly try to show that opinion was in favour of opening such shops." One witness in the Central Provinces sees serious objections to referring the question to public opinion on the ground that, "whenever public opinion is taken, it has led to many difficulties and mal-administration." There are three opinions, two in Bengal and one in Madras, for consulting district and local boards as well as municipalities regarding the opening and shutting of shops; and one witness in Bengal would ascertain local option through the panchayats which exist under the Chaukidari Act; but none of these witnesses seem to have much confidence in the plan they propose. Commission's view of local option. 688. The Commission feel that except in municipalities where the responsibi- lity of regulating the number of the shops might with advantage be shared by the District and Municipal authorities, there is not much need or opportunity for soliciting public opinion in regard to the matter; but that the leading rural notables, zamindars, or head- men should be consulted by the subordinate officer who reports the case when new shops are proposed, and that objections, if presented, should continue to receive the most careful attention. But the district officer must be wholly responsible for not allowing shops to exist where there is not a demand for them. Maximum of possession. 689. The object of limiting the amount of the drug which may be legally possessed by any one person is to place a check upon smuggling and to restrict consumption. The imposition of this limit is specially required where the proximity of Native States affords facilities for the former; and recommendations for lowering the maximum are made by several witnesses in this connection. Consumption is also thereby checked, for not only is excess fostered by the possession of a large store, but means are afforded for more extensive distribution of the drug. The maximum of legal possession is very different in different parts of India. The limit as fixed by Act XXII of 1881, which is in force in the North-Western Provinces,

[CH. XVI. to be higher than in the case of ganja. But upon the whole the Commission think that the two products, ganja and bhang, are sufficiently distinct, and that no great objection exists to allowing a higher maximum. They would therefore recommend that 5 tolas for ganja or charas and 20 tolas or 1/4 sr for bhang be regarded as the proper maxima for all provinces, and that as opportunity offers all Native States be advised to accept these limits. There is certainly some advantage, considering how British territory is interlaced with Native State territory, in having one standard in this respect for the whole of India. Taxation of hemp drugs according to strength. 691. In the case of the excise of spirits, the duty is levied on the alcoholic content of the liquid as determined by the percentage of proof spirit present, and, in view of the varying amount of resin extraction present in different qualities of hemp drugs (on which the narcotic value depends), it might be argued that the equitable mode of levying duty would be by the adoption of a sliding scale, the duty varying with the percentage of resin extraction present. But there are at present practical difficulties against the adoption of such a system. The physiological value of the resin extraction present in all samples is not similar; and, though two specimens may contain precisely the same percent- age of resin extraction, it does not follow that the narcotic power of the drugs would be equal, and also that the percentage of extraction in the drugs may vary from year to year. The Commission, therefore, make no recommendation regarding the taxation of hemp drugs according to their strength. Burma. History of prohibition. 692. The province of Burma stands on a different footing from that of any other province, inasmuch as the hemp drugs are entirely prohibited. This prohibition was put into force in the year 1873 and embodied in the Excise Act, 1881. The Chief Com- missioner has power to grant special licenses for cultivation, sale, and possession of the drugs; but the power has not been used. The prohibition arose out of the inquiry made by the Government of India in 1871. Sir Ashley Eden, then Chief Commissioner, recorded the following remarks regarding ganja in his review of the Excise Report for 1870-71: "The sale of this article is prohibited at Ram- ree, Sandoway, Tavoy, and Mergui, and the Chief Commissioner considers that no further addition should be made to the number of places for the sale of this pernicious drug, which is smoked only by the natives of India. Indeed, he would be glad to have the opinion of the Commissioners as to the possibility of with- drawing all licenses for the sale of ganja throughout the province. Its use is at present happily little known to the people of the country; at the same time there is every reason to fear that a taste for it may be spread among them by the people of India as in the case of opium. It certainly seems to the Chief Commissioner that it is very desirable to at once sacrifice the small revenue derived from this source and stop the consumption absolutely before the evil comes upon the country. The only sufferers from the cessation of the supply will be a few of the Indian labourers who come to work here during the rice season. They must learn to take the want of ganja as one of the discomforts of a sojourn in a foreign land, for which they are amply compensated by the large earnings they obtain. The Chief Commissioner observes that the percentage of persons admitted to

[CH. XVI. correct or not. But in the case of ganja there seems little or no risk of the Burmese taking to its use in contravention of the law, inasmuch as they seem to have no predisposition to do so. Under these circumstances the Commission would recom- mend that where there is a demand for the hemp drugs among natives of India in Burma, provision should be made for meeting this demand by a licit supply under the same regulations as are in force in other non-producing countries, the prohibition of cultivation being maintained as well as that of the use by the Burmans.
CHAPTER XVII. SYSTEMS OF NATIVE STATES. Systems in Native States. 696. The foregoing chapter contains the views of the Commission on the introduction throughout British India of a system of excise in regard to hemp drugs which will be ultimately uniform. But this uniformity of system must necessarily fail of its purpose unless the co-operation of the Native States which are interlaced with British territory is at the same time secured. A brief review of the systems at present in force in Native States is therefore necessary, together with some remarks as to the desirability of securing the adoption of a similar system in those States. The material at the disposal of the Commission in regard to the States is somewhat incomplete and fragmentary, but a good deal of inform- ation of a general character has been obtained which will enable the Commission to come to some decision on the subject. States in the Himalayan tract where the plant grows wild. 697. The conditions under which the wild hemp is found have been detailed in Chapter III. Generally it may be said that the wild growth only thrives in the Himalayan tract. The Native States falling within this tract are Kashmir, some of the Punjab Hill States, Garhwal Tehri and Rampur in the North-Western Provinces, Nepal, Kuch Behar, and the Assam Hill States. In all these States bhang is produced; but as the control of bhang in similarly situated tracts in British territory has been pronounced impracticable, this fact need not interfere with British excise arrangements. Kashmir apparently produces no charas properly so called, and all the charas which comes to the Punjab through Kashmir is accounted for under the Punjab system of registration. A little charas comes from Garhwal and from Nepal, but the amount is not sufficient to disturb British arrangements. The cultivation of ganja is prohibited in Kuch Behar, which receives its supplies from Rajshahi, the duty being credited to the State. Ganja to a very small extent is said to be imported from Nepal, and there is considerable smuggling of inferior ganja from the Assam Hill States which has been noticed in Chapter XV. With this last exception, it may be stated generally that the system or want of system in regard to hemp drugs in all these States is a factor which need not be taken into account in the excise system of British India. And as regards the Assam Hill States, it is probable that no further preventive measures can be taken at present than those already adopted, viz., prevention through the Assam Excise establishment when the drug is brought into British territory for sale. There is no system in force in the Hill States, and for some time to come it is not likely that any can be expected. In other States the production of ganja is the most important feature. 698. The extent to which the hemp drugs are produced in the Native States in other parts of India, and exported from them to the various British provinces, has been detailed in Chapters IV and VII of this Report, so far as can be gathered from the informa- tion received. It is mainly in respect of the production of ganja that the arrange- ments in these States have any perceptible effect on the British excise system. The conditions of the principal States or groups of States in this respect will be briefly noticed in the following paragraphs as well as the systems in force.
344 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XVII. Hyderabad. 699. The cultivation of hemp for ganja in Hyderabad is said to amount to 300 or 400 acres. Bhang is the refuse of the ganja so produced. There is no restriction of cultivation, but the right of selling the drugs is auctioned, and the cultivators are bound to dispose of their produce to the licensee. There are 270 shops for the sale of ganja and bhang and 50 for majum. In small districts the contract of sale is given with that of certain poisons (arsenic, strychnia, and aconite) and opium. For foreign import or export of ganja a duty of Rs. 10 per maund is levied, and of bhang Rs. 3-5 per maund. The imports of ganja as given in the State memorandum average for five years 79 maunds, and the exports 9 maunds only. But there are no reliable statistics. The Director of Agriculture puts the outturn at 5 to 6 maunds per acre, which would give a result of from 1,500 to 2,400 maunds per annum. Of this, only an average of 300 maunds is traceable as having been transmitted by railway. There is no record of the ganja trans- mitted by other means. The Hyderabad State marches with the Madras and Bombay Presidencies, Berar, and the Central Provinces, but only for a short distance with the last named. There are no complaints of smuggling from Hyderabad into the Central Provinces, though smuggling from Berar is mentioned. If ganja is systematically treated in Madras, Bombay, and Berar, the arrangements will be incomplete unless a similar change is made in the Hyderabad State; and as the regular cultivation in the latter appears to be confined to certain definite areas, control will probably be quite feasible should the Darbar agree to exercise it. For the present, however, the existing arrangements under which the produce must all be made over to the licensed vendors and a tax levied on all imports and exports will, if they are observed, be sufficient to check the export of ganja to British provinces. When by reason of the perfecting of the system in British territory the inducements to smuggle cheap ganja from Hyderabad are increased, it will then be advisable to suggest to the State the desirability of exercising more complete control over the cultivation of the plant and its produce. Mysore. 700. The administration of excise in Mysore in respect of hemp drugs is based upon Act XXII of 1881, which is in force in the State, and is in advance of that of both the presidencies which adjoin it. Cultivation is forbidden except under license, and the produce of all licensed cultivation must be sold to the licensed contractor or exported under a pass. But licensed cultivation has been practically abandoned; and though it is stated in the memorandum that illicit cultivation and smuggling are not carried on to any appreciable extent, there seems some doubt whether this view is correct. Mr. McDonnell, the Special Assistant Excise Commissioner, states that, "owing to the heavy dues imposed by the State (Rs. 24 per Indian maund) and the abnormally low price of ganja across the frontier, there are strong inducements to commit a fraud on the Mysore revenue." Thus, although the climate and soil of the State are well adapted for the produc- tion of the ganja plant, the regulations introduced by the State authorities for controlling its production have had the effect of stopping it altogether owing to the want of system in British territory and the facility with which it is procurable thence at a much lower rate; and a large amount of the ganja
CH. XVII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 345 imported pays no duty. In regard to this, Mr. McDonnell says: "Mysore is heavily handicapped by the extensive smuggling of ganja from Her Majesty's territory." The system of licensing sale and levying fees therefor in Mysore may be thus briefly described. A contract is given to a single person on condition that346 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XVII. State would very probably revive; and as there is now practically no cultivation, the present time would be opportune for moving the State to introduce a thorough system of control in this respect also. Central India Agency. 703. The information regarding the excise administration of the Native States in Central India in respect of hemp drugs is very in- complete. From Gwalior, where there is a considerable amount of ganja produced, no information has been received except that which has been furnished through the North-Western Provinces. Through the courtesy of the Agent to the Governor-General, a useful memorandum has been recorded by Mr. R. H. Gunion, of Indore, which puts in a compendious form all the inform- ation obtained from the other States in the Agency. The Minister to His Highness the Maharaja of Holkar has also given a full account of the adminis- tration of that State. There is cultivation of the hemp plant for the production of ganja in Indore, Baghelkhand, Dewas, Bhopawar, and Gwalior, and possibly also in Bhopal and Western Malwa. There appears to be no restriction of cultivation in the Central India Agency, and Mr. Gunion thinks that there is no system of licensing sale of the drugs except in Indore and Rewa, though the Commission have ascertained from other sources that sale is licensed in Gwalior and Bhopal. Mr. Gunion's opinion that there are no restrictions on manufacture or on import and export of the drug, but that duties are levied on it as on other merchandise, appears to be correct. Indore. 704. In Indore the average cultivation, which is said to be on the decrease, is reported by the State officials above mentioned to be about 181 bighas. or 113 acres, and the average imports and exports of ganja 153 maunds and 377 maunds respectively; but in 1892-93 the imports amounted to 84 maunds and the exports to 1,318 maunds. It is therefore clear that the exports exceed the imports. Mr. Stoker says that a little ganja is imported into the North-Western Provinces from Indore. Mr. Drake-Brockman says that ganja is largely grown in the Sanawad pargana of Indore, which separates the Kanapur Beria tract from the rest of the Nimar district in the Central Provinces, and there is thus a considerable area into which the introduction of Indore ganja is practically inevitable. Accordingly in 1879 a suggestion was made to the Agent to the Governor-General that exports from Indore territory should be taxed and only permitted under formal pass, and a duty of Rs. 7 per maund was fixed by the Darbar. This seems to have check- ed smuggling, for the evidence from the Central Provinces is against its prevalence, though some still exists. Mr. Gunion's estimate of the amount of ganja and bhang annually produced is 900 maunds. The right to sell by retail is auctioned. There were 45 licenses in 1892-93. The income from this source appears to be on the increase, and this is the case also as regards the fixed duties since 1886-87. Inthe latter year they amounted to Rs. 461. In 1892-93 they were Rs. 3,111. It is evident that the Indore State possesses considerable facilities for the production of ganja and for its distribution in British territory, and in the in- terests of the system of administration proposed for British provinces it is ex- tremely desirable that the production of the drug in this State should be brought under control.
CH. XVII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 347 Gwalior. 705. All that is known about the administration of the hemp drugs in Gwalior is that the cultivation is reported to be about 400 acres; that a duty of Rs. 5 per maund is levied on all ganja exported to British provinces, and Rs. 2-8-0 per maund on ganja trans- ported from one place to another in the State; and that the cultivator may only sell to a licensed vendor. The Commission also have information that the cultivator pays Rs. 12 per acre over and above his fixed rent; but whether this payment is made to the State is not clear. There is a fixed rate for retail sale, 4 annas per sr. Mr. Stoker is of opinion that the Gwalior ganja is gaining ground in the North-Western Provinces, and is being substituted for the Khand- wa ganja, while both together are ousting the supply of Bengal ganja. The culti- vation is said to be confined to three tahsils of the State348 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XVII. said to be cultivated to some extent, and the produce not to be distinguishable from Gwalior ganja. Mr. Stoker notes that this source of supply is capable of extension. The capital and a great part of the Chirkari State is situated in the middle of the Hamirpur district in the North-Western Provinces. The country is wild and mountainous, and prevention of smuggling is impossible. From the Panna State there is considerable smuggling into the Damoh district of the Central Provinces. It is very desirable in the interests of the excise administra- tion of the North-Western Provinces that the cultivation and production of the drug should be controlled in this Agency. Bhopawar Agency. 709. Mr. Gunion says that all over the Bhopawar Agency the hemp plant is cultivated for ganja and bhang, rarely for charas. The production is limited, and, except in the parts adjoining British Nimar, only for the personal use of the cultivators. No other information has been obtained. Mr. Robertson, Deputy Commissioner of Nimar, says that ganja smuggling from the Native States which border on Nimar, though it no doubt exists, has never been a prominent matter in Nimar. It is the general opinion, however, that a good deal of petty smuggling exists. Western Malwa Agency. 710. Mr.Gunion mentions a kind of ganja called 'gorakhi,' which is said to be made from the wild plant in the Jaora State of the Western Malwa Agency. The Commission are in possession of a statement made by Surgeon Lieutenant-Colonel Caldecott, Agency Surgeon, that there is cultivation for the production of charas, bhang, and ganja all over Malwa, but he is unable to say to what extent. The States of this Agency (Jaora and Rutlam) do not adjoin British territory. Rajputana Agency. Jeypore. 711. In the Jeypore State there is practically no system of administration of the hemp drugs. Customs duty is levied on import and export at the rate of Rs. 4 per maund for ganja, Rs. 20 per maund for charas, and Re. 1 per maund for bhang. There is also an inland customs duty of 4 annas per maund on bhang. There is no restriction in regard to cultivation, manufacture, sale, or possession of the drugs. As noticed in the chapter on cultivation, it is stated in the memorandum that 10,000 maunds of bhang are produced, indicating a large rural consumption if the figure is correct; for only 27 maunds are said to be exported. Ganja and charas are imported, not produced in the State. Jeypore does not adjoin British territory, and further control is not at present essential to the success of a system of administration in the British provinces. Jodhpur. 712. Duties are levied in the Jodhpur State as follows:CH.

The import of ganja and charas. under parwana from the Residency amounted to 1,735 maunds during the ten years 1883-84 to 1892-93. The imported ganja mostly comes from Indore. The ganja produced from the sporadic growth of the plant is called 'makuria,' and being of very inferior quality is said not to be offered for sale. A contract for sale of the drugs has been given since 1880 in the towns of Jodh- pur and Pali, which is auctioned to the highest bidder. There are 14 retail vendors in Jodhpur, all of whom are under the control of the contractor, who himself has two shops in the town. The retail vendors are ordinary shopkeepers, who sell the drugs along with other articles. There are no retail vendors in Pali. Elsewhere there is no restriction on the sale of the drugs. Jodhpur does not adjoin British territory. Udaipur. 713. No memorandum has been furnished from Udaipur. The State does not adjoin British territory. There seems to be a certain amount of production of ganja and bhang, but the use of ganja and charas seems to be very limited. Bikanir. 714. The excise of the drugs was introduced in 1893. There is no restriction on cultivation, but the cultivators may only sell their produce to the State contractors. Contracts for wholesale vend are sold by auction at the tahsils, and the contractors obtain licenses for their retail vendors, and are permitted to sell by retail themselves. The shops for retail vend are not auctioned. The contractor fixes the prices for retail sale, subject to a minimum fixed by the State officials. A customs duty on imports is levied at the rate of Rs. 20 per maund for ganja and charas and Rs. 5 per maund for bhang. Under an agreement with the British Government, the export of intoxicating drugs from the State into British territory is prohibited. (Bikanir Salt Agreement, Aitchison, No. CXXVIII, Article 5). The observ- ance of this provision will render any further action in regard to this State in the interests of the British excise administration unnecessary at present. Alwar. 715. There is no restriction on cultivation, but bhang only is produced on well lands and on the borders of fields. Ganja is unknown; a little charas and bhang is imported. The mono- poly of the import and sale of the drugs is granted to a contractor, together with that of poppy and opium, for a fixed sum. There is no duty on import, but an octroi duty of 10 annas per maund is levied on bhang. The contractor is at liberty to make his own arrangements regarding sale of the drugs. The number of retail shops in 1893 was 44. No limit has been fixed for retail sale or possession. Alwar adjoins the Delhi Division of the Punjab. Bhartpur. 716. The hemp drugs are said not to be produced in Bhartpur. A customs duty on imports is levied at the rate of Rs. 10 per maund on charas and Rs. 5 per maund on bhang. There is no further restriction apparently. The drugs are imported. There is apparently no cultivation now, though some formerly existed. Bhartpur adjoins the North-Western Provinces. The conditions existing in this State are not likely to affect British excise administration. 88
350 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XVII. Kotah. 717. The monopoly of vend in the Kotah State is auctioned to contractors. Besides the revenue thus realised, a duty of Re. 1 per maund is levied on ganja imported into the State, and the same on bhang brought into the town of Kotah. A transit duty of 8 annas per maund is also charged on ganja and bhang. Charas is not imported. There is a small local production of ganja and bhang, but no regular cultivation. It is stated that there is a "ruling" of 1881 about buying, selling, and possessing intoxicating drugs, but it is not enforced. This State does not adjoin British territory. Tonk. 718. Beyond the levy of a customs duty at the rate of Rs. 20 per cent. of value on all hemp drugs in Tonk and Aligarh, Rs. 6 per maund in Chabra, and Rs. 8 per maund in Sironj, there is no excise administration in respect of the drugs in the Tonk State. A proposal to draw up a set of rules is under consideration. Ganja and charas are imported, not produced. Bhang is produced in the State and imported from Jeypore. The State does not adjoin British territory. Jhallawar. 719. An import duty of 8 annas per maund of 35 srs on ganja and bhang and of one anna per maund on charas is levied in the Jhallawar State, and it is said that there are local dues of 2 annas per maund on ganja and bhang, while one per cent. is levied on all sales of either drug, weighment dues being also levied when they are sold by weight. There is a licensed farmer of the drugs in the cantonment. Beyond this, there is no excise system in respect of hemp drugs. The extent of cultivation is about 30 acres, producing about 155 maunds of ganja and 30 of bhang. The trade returns do not distinguish between ganja and bhang: the average import of both drugs is said to be 105 maunds, and the export 120 maunds. Charas is not used. The State does not adjoin British territory. Bundi. 720. Import and transit duties are levied in the Bundi State at the rate of 8 annas per maund on all hemp drugs imported into or passing through the State territory. Beyond this there is no system of administration in respect of hemp drugs. It is stated that the drugs are not manufactured in the State, but that cultivators grow hemp on land irrigated by wells as other crops. The drugs are imported from other States. The import of bhang is large, averaging 9,385 maunds; that of ganja and charas is small, amounting to 100 and 25 maunds respectively. The total import duties amount to Rs. 4,440 and transit duties to Rs. 610. The State does not adjoin British territory. Dholpur. 721. In Dholpur import duties are levied on ganja and bhang at Rs. 4-4-0 per maund and on charas at Rs. 1-1-0 per sr. In the Sri Mathra Estate the duties areCH.

Dholpur adjoins the North-Western Prov- inces. Banswara. 722. In Banswara no memorandum has been furnished, but the Commission have information from the officials that ganja and bhang are produced. The State adjoins the Bombay Presidency. Nothing is known of the system of excise administration. Serohi. 723. A statement has been furnished for Serohi which shows that licenses to sell ganja are given for seven places in the State, and a revenue averaging Rs. 386 per annum realised for license fees (Rs. 863 for 1892-93) and Rs. 145 for fixed duty. There are license holders, but they keep no record. Only ganja is imported, the average being 32 maunds per annum. Cultivation is unrestricted and not recorded. The Kotwal of Serohi estimates the outturn of ganja produced in the State at 8 maunds, and bhang at 300 maunds. No exports are shown. It is stated that the whole of the ganja and bhang produced in the country, averaging one maund of the former and 40 maunds of the latter, is recovered from the cultivators and given in charity and sent to the temples of Mahadeo, and some is used in liquor. The State does not adjoin British territory. Kerowli. 724. Customs duties are levied in the Kerowli State on imports at the rate of Rs. 2-8-0 per maund on ganja, Rs. 10 on charas, and Re. 1 on bhang. During the Shivratri fair in February the duties are suspended. The right of retail vend at three towns is sold by auction, and there are 8 licenses for retail vend. No further control is exercised. The plant is cultivated for bhang, and ganja is imported. The transactions shown are very small, but the license fee averages Rs. 1,157 per annum. The State does not adjoin British territory. Kishengarh. 725. The only system of control in force in the Kishengarh State consists in the levy of duties (apparently import duties) at the rate of Re. 1-8-0 per maund on ganja and charas and 4 annas on bhang. The farming system used to prevail, but has been abandoned. It is now proposed to increase the duties and to license vendors. The transactions are small. Kishengarh adjoins Ajmere. Jaisalmir. 726. In Jaisalmir there is provision for levying customs duties, but it is stated that there has been no import or export of hemp drugs for the last ten years, and that the drugs are not sold in the State. There is, however, a little cultivation for ganja and bhang, which is purchased by the consumers from the cultivators. Jaisalmir adjoins Sind, and a small amount of ganja and charas is said to be smuggled into Sind through this State. Shahpura. 727. In this small State import and export duties are charged at rates not mentioned. Transit duty at 3 pies per sr is also levied on bhang exported to foreign States in addi- tion to the export duty. There is no further control of any kind. In future it is proposed to issue licenses to a limited number of persons at a few selected places.
352 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XVII. Partabgarh and Lawa. 728. No information has been received regard- ing these small States. Hill States lying between Bengal, Central Provinces, and Madras. 729. It will be convenient next to notice together that tract which lies en- closed between Bengal, the Central Provinces, and Madras, comprising the Tributary States of the two first and the Agency tracts of the last named province. In this manner only is it possible to consider systematically and thoroughly the question of bringing the excise arrangements in respect of hemp drugs which prevail in this tract into some conformity with the general principles recommended by the Commission. This tract may be divided into four parts, viz., the Chota Nagpur Tributary Mahals and the Orissa Tributary Mahals, both under the Bengal Government; the Chhattisgarh Tributary States, under the Central Provinces; and the Agency Tracts, under the Madras Government. The following table shows the area, population, and revenue of each of these groups:CH. XVII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 353 of ganja into some of the Feudatory States from the States or Agencies in Bengal and Madras. The Political Agent says: "The States of Raigarh, Raira Khol, and Sonpur all complain bitterly of the smuggling into their territories of ganja from the adjoining Bengal States. The reports from the Patna State have been somewhat conflicting. There seems no doubt that there has been in former years considerable ground for a similar complaint here; but it seems that the evil has of late been considerably reduced by improved police arrangements. Both Kalahandi and Bastar complain of smuggling from the Jeypore State in Madras." Tributary States of Chota Nagpur. 731. In the Chota Nagpur Tributary States, Seraikela and Kharsawan, the cultivation of ganja is prohibited. Ganja is im- ported from Bengal. There is a contractor in Khar- sawan who holds at the same time the monopoly of sale of opium. There are four shops in Seraikela the licenses for which are sometimes sold by auction, and sometimes granted at fixed rates. In the other States there is no very definite system of excise administration in respect of hemp drugs. There are no shops for the sale of the drugs, though one formerly existed in Gangpur and Jashpur, which derived their supplies from the Government gola at Ranchi; and Mr. Grim- ley, Commissioner of Chota Nagpur, says that he gave a license some months ago to a vendor in the Gangpur State to import ganja, though he cannot definitely say that the shop has been opened yet. Duty on the cultivation of ganja grown by the people for their domestic use is levied in Udaipur, Gangpur, and Bonai. In Gangpur it is 4 annas per plant, and in Bonai 1 anna 6 pies per plant. The amount of the Udaipur duty is not mentioned. In 1883 the Commissioner of Excise, Central Provinces, complained that untaxed ganja from Sirguja, Gang- pur, and Udaipur was imported into Sambalpur and Bilaspur; and the Commis- sioner, Mr. Hewitt, ordered the chiefs not to allow ganja to be grown by any one without their permission, and to keep lists of those who grew ganja and see that they did not grow more than they wanted for their own use, and that no one was allowed to sell ganja. In regard to this order, Mr. Grimley, Commissioner of Chota Nagpur, says: "I am not prepared to say that the Rajas keep the lists prescribed; but I think the spirit of the order is carried out. I think the chiefs are very loyal and willing to do what they are told in regard to such matters." Tributary States of Orissa. 732. The Tributary States of Orissa have for many years constituted the principal difficulty of the Bengal Government in regard to its excise administration of the hemp drugs. It was first in 1878 that the attention of Government was seriously directed to the illicit trade from the Tributary States, and apprehensions for the safety of the excise revenue in Orissa were entertained. At this time the existing rules permitted the import into Orissa of Garhjat ganja and bhang under a system of passes and at a fixed duty of one rupee a sr. Four proposals were laid before Government354 REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. [CH. XVII. These measures proved ineffectual; and, although the consumption of Raj- shahi ganja may have increased somewhat in all three districts of Orissa, it was believed that smuggling still continued to a considerable extent. The policy of total prohibition of cultivation naturally suggested itself again, and in 1884 was carried out in Mohurbhanj, which happened to be under the direct control of the Bengal Government. Rs. 300 a year was given to Mohurbhanj as compensation, and Rajshahi ganja was imported into the State under the ordinary Excise rules. In June 1882 the importation of Garhjat ganja and bhang into British terri- tory was entirely prohibited, but it was not till 1884 that the prohibition was actually enforced. Further, from the same year (1882) the policy was adopted of levying duty in Orissa on Rajshahi ganja at rates lower than elsewhere in the province. Attempts were also made to entirely suppress cultivation in several of the States with the co-operation of the chiefs, and in 1889 the Superintendent of the Tribu- tary Mahals reported that prohibition had been enforced in eleven of the States, but that the chiefs of four other States objected to the measure. In 1889 the Bengal Government finally concluded that the experiment of entirely prohibiting cultivation must be abandoned as useless and inefficacious, and that the only way to prevent smuggling was to legalise importation under suitable regulations. Doubts were also entertained as to the real nature of Garhjat ganja. It was suggested that Garhjat ganja in a particular form was looked upon as an absolute necessary of life with certain influential classes in Puri, and that injury might be done by encouraging the use of the strong Rajshahi drug in place of the milder local article. The Government after some hesitation arrived at the distinct conclusion that Garhjat ganja was taken as a drink and not smoked, and that it was "on a different footing altogether from the well known deleterious drug imported from Rajshahi." It was accordingly proposed to legalise the im- portation of Garhjat ganja at a duty of eight annas a sr (the rate prevailing in Bengal for bhang), and at the same time the orders prohibiting cultivation, whe- ther within the three miles limit or not, were withdrawn. In 1890, after further consideration and with fuller information on the subject, the Bengal Government altered the opinion they had formed that Garhjat ganja was merely a form of bhang, and arrived at the contrary conclusion, viz., that Garhjat ganja is a true ganja like the Rajshahi article, but inferior, and that it is used for smoking exactly as that drug is. The Government of India were accordingly requested to sanction a duty of Rs. 2-8-0 a sr on Garhjat ganja, which was done. In December 1890 the orders prohibiting the possession of Garhjat ganja in Orissa were rescinded, and in March 1892 orders regulating its import were issued. From 1st April 1893 the duty on Garhjat ganja was raised to Rs. 3-8 a sr to assimilate it with a rise in the duty on Rajshahi ganja. Under existing rules, any licensed wholesale or retail vendor may import. Garhjat ganja under a pass from the Collector, for which a fee of Rs. 2 is charged.
CH. XVII.] REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. 355 The minimum amount which may be imported is one maund at a time. With a view to the prevention of smuggling, the maximum of possession of Garhjat ganja has been reduced from 20 tolas to 5 tolas since May 1892. Thus the following systems have been in force:
