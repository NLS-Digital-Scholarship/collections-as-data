A postmortem room, Hospital Surgeon's quarters, quarters for married and unmarried over- seers have been built, and the laboratory accommodation has been extended by the addition of a room for photomicrography and a dark room. 16. In Bombay, continued improvement is being made. A hostel with accommodation for 76 students was completed and occupied. Native profes- sors' quarters have been provided. The new college building is nearing com- pletion and will probably be ready for occupation this year. The pharmacy has been extended and the postmortem room improved. A new cattle opera- tion shed has been built and the dog ward reconstructed. It is proposed to add a very badly needed contagious disease ward and dissection and post- mortem rooms in the new compound of the Government Veterinary College, and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to animals is to build a new operation shed. 17. There have been a few changes in the Imperial staff at the colleges during the year. Major A. Smith has been appointed Principal and Captain W. O. Dawson, Professor of Surgery at the Punjab College. In Bengal, Mr. Brand has replaced Mr. E. Burke who did good work there and who has been transferred as a Deputy Superintendent to the Hissar Cattle Farm. Mr. Aitchison has been employed in the Madras College. Mr. Sowerby officiated as Principal and Mr. Ware as Assistant Principal at the Bombay College during Major Joslen's absence on three months' leave. We have lost by retirement the faithful services of one of the Pioneers of veterinary teaching in Khan Bahadur Dr. Amir Shah of the Punjab College. He will be greatly missed as he did exceptionally good service and was held in great respect by teachers, students and the outside public. Much remains to be done in the direction of strengthening the teaching staff in the younger institutions and this will be effected as officers become available in the Imperial staff. 18. The total number of students who completed the courses in the various classes during the year was 629. The number of students who gra- duated from the colleges was 143 against 120 last year. From the Punjab College 71 or 91.02 per cent., Bengal 37 or 88.09 per cent., Bombay 23 or 79.31 per cent., and Madras 17 or 73 91 per cent. Four passed from the Burma Veterinary School against 19 last year. 19. The reports of the Boards of Examiners were favourable in all cases and great improvement is noticed in Madras. 20. With a view to improving the method of examination and securing more uniformity, endeavours are being made to establish a more permanent Board. For the convenience of teachers, students and examiners, I am trying to fix the dates for the examinations at the different Colleges and to allot subjects to each Examiner. 21. There were 485 students remaining under instruction at the Colleges and 63 in the Burma School at the end of the collegiate year, against 530 and 40, respectively, last year. 22. With regard to students, the demand for admission to the Punjab and Bengal Colleges is still far in excess of the accommodation and a good selection can be made. In Bombay and Madras, however, this is not the case; but few candidates for the Government Scholarships were forthcoming at the former and the standard of examination for entrance had to be lowered at the latter. 23. The question of the standard of the educational qualifications of the students admitted to the Colleges during the year is one which is worthy of attention. It is very necessary for students in Madras, Bombay and Bengal to have a really good knowledge of English in which their training has to be carried out. It was noticed by the Examiners that in some cases the students did not possess a sufficiently good knowledge to express themselves in this language. These students were admitted some time ago. This subject is receiv-
5 ing attention at the various Colleges. The sanction of the Secretary of State to the formation of a Provincial and pensionable subordinate service in Bengal will materially assist in obtaining men of fair education and it is a matter for congratulation that 11 matriculates joined that College this year against 3 last year. Bombay is also devoting more attention to this subject and the proportion of matriculates who joined during the year is still good, i.e., 16 out of 49 against 17 out of 49 last year. In Madras, 20 matriculates joined out of 29 against 16 out of 23 last year. The Board of Examiners remarked that the material was distinctly good and my own experience is that the students who presented themselves at the final examinations were very intelligent. Although, therefore, Madras is still on the same footing as other Colleges in regard to the standard of education required for admission, we have pretty strong evidence that the starting pay and the general prospects of the Department are not sufficient there to attract a class of men with really good educational qualifi- cations. 24. In Burma, a good deal of difficulty is experienced in obtaining men with the required educational qualifications for local reasons. 25. In addition to the training of Veterinary Graduates, classes for trans- port drivers were held. In the Punjab, 65, in Bombay 10, and in Bengal 8 men received a three months' course of dressing and first aid during the Col- lege vacations. Nine nalbunds were trained at Lahore and 2 in Bengal. 26. A course of 48 lectures in Veterinary Hygiene and Cattle breeding and rearing were delivered to 23 agricultural students of the Civil Engineering College in Calcutta. 27. In the research laboratories attached to the Punjab and Bengal Veterinary Colleges, the sphere of work has extended in various directions. Punjab is the only one where a half time officer has been employed and he has this year, for the first time, been able to submit a report on the work which has been done. This has been:6 32. It will be seen that considerable progress continues to be made in developing the resources of all our Veterinary Colleges and placing them on a better footing in regard to buildings and equipment. The younger Colleges are steadily making progress in this direction. We cannot at present comp- lete the Imperial staff of teachers but when officers become available for the purpose this will be done. II.-TREATMENT OF DISEASE. Contagious disease amongst solipeds, Outbreaks, Mortality, etc. 33. The reported mortality from contagious diseases amongst the ani- mals named therein is shown in Table II. The Army Remount Department deals with all cases of contagious disease amongst equines occurring in the districts selected for horse breeding under their Department and we have no record of them. 34. The same remarks as were made last year in regard to their accuracy, apply equally this year. The figures relate only to cases which have been brought to the notice of the staff and do not in any way represent the total mortality from contagious diseases in our districts. 35. Glanders 7 41. Surra.8 49. The disease was reported from eight districts and caused 50 deaths in Eastern Bengal and Assam. The outbreaks at Dacca, Sylhet and Sibsagar were confirmed by microscopical examination of material submitted to the Superintendent. 50. In Bengal, 4 cases have been reported from Saran and 9 from Cham- paran, but the diagnosis was not apparently confirmed. There should not be any difficulty in arranging to obtain material for diagnostic purposes now that the graduates are trained to collect it and a laboratory is available in Calcutta. 51. There is no record of where the 15 cases in Madras occurred or whe- ther the diagnosis was confirmed. 52. Dourine.9 Orders have recently been issued to all Superintendents to exercise their judgment in fixing the dose required in the various stages of outbreaks with a view to a sufficiently large dose being employed. They are also to decide what cattle are to be inoculated. 59. Rinderpest.10 65. Upper Burma.11 applications for assistance could be met, or in Chhatisgarh where half the out- breaks were attended. In Jubbulpore, however, and in Narsingpur, Hoshanga- bad and Chindwara districts of the Nerbudda Division, where the disease was present in epidemic form and widespread, notwithstanding that all the available staff was deputed, the disease could not be dealt with effectively. In the Jubbulpore Division only 272 out of 1,311 outbreaks could be attended and in the Nerbudda Division only 86 out of 543. 72. A scheme for converting the veterinary subordinate staff into a Pro- vincial service has been under consideration and has since received the sanction of the Secretary of State and no doubt this will place the Superintendent in a better position to provide for emergencies. 73. Punjab.12 causes death in a day or two and then disappears to appear again in the same way some time later, it is very difficult to see how we are to effectively combat it by means of a serum, which is not very strong and gives very fugitive passive immunity. The serum used was tested in the laboratory against the virus as well as by Wright's method in the Punjab laboratory and the results obtained were not such as to justify its continued use in the field so I stopped the issue in December last. It had only been issued for experimental use in the field and owing to the smallness of the staff and the nature and course of the disease it was very difficult to ascertain whether good results were being obtained or not. Captain Walker, who has taken great interest in this subject, states that in some places the people had confidence in it. Altogether 82,849 incontact animals were inoculated up to December. In the Punjab 44,236, United Provinces 32,206, Eastern Bengal and Assam 2,129, North-West Frontier Province 1,793, Central Provinces 1,207, and Madras 1,179. The disease is now being studied in the Punjab Veterinary College laboratory and work with a view to obtaining either a stronger serum or a safe and effective vaccine is being done at the Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory. 81. Anthrax.13 84. With regard to the method of dealing with the disease by the serum alone method, I am well aware that it is not an ideal or very effective one; but in the presence of infection or suspected infection, when cure of the animal is sought, it is useful. It may also be used at the commencement of an epizooty with benefit, as it undoubtedly does confer a certain amount of passive im- munity to the disease. We are in possession of serum which is capable of giving a passive immunity to the disease and this has been more or less freely used in various reputed outbreaks. Knowing as we do that the immunity is passive and lasts a comparatively short time, whilst the causal agent of Anthrax remains living in the form of spores in infected zones for a very long time and that no rigorous hygienic measures can be adopted in this country, it does not seem likely that much good would result from the use of the serum in the field, because the animals if kept under the same conditions would take the disease again if exposed to the infection a short time afterwards. My opinion, therefore, is that attempts to deal with outbreaks of reputed but undiagnosed Anthrax should be stopped and steps be taken to obtain more accurate information. In outbreaks where the diagnosis is confirmed we may use serum at first and later the simultaneous method, when we have men sufficiently highly trained to apply it safely. 85. I do not advocate the use of any known vaccine by the present sub- ordinate staff as I am of opinion that it would be likely to do far more harm than good. We cannot, at the present stage, afford to make use of any method which is liable to be followed by inoculation mortality as the people are only yet being educated in the use of prophylactics and deaths from inoculation would most undoubtedly shake their confidence and hinder the expansion of Rinderpest inoculation. This is a point of very great importance in this country. We must be very sure of our ground and firmly established before we can venture on the use of methods which do undoubtedly give greater and more lasting im- munity than serum alone does, but which may be followed by inoculation mor- tality. In new localities such deaths in previously apparently healthy cattle would probably put a stop to inoculation for any disease. In order to be pre- pared with a known reliable method of conferring more lasting immunity which will be available for use in outbreaks where skilled assistance can be obtained and the necessity is proved, we are examining various methods and are so far in favour of the simultaneous method. 86. Recent observations which have been communicated by Professor Dr. Sobernheim on the combined inoculation against Anthrax of serum and culture by the simultaneous method which has been carried out on great number of animals during 1904-05 in the Argentine Republic and Uruguay, furnish a proof of the great value of anti-anthrax inoculation when it can be properly applied. They further confirm the favourable results which have previously been communicated and show that the method is an effective obstacle to infection in a region where contagion is severe and persistent. In 500,000 animals inoculated not a single death due to inoculation is recorded in South America and the statistics show that it led to total suppression or a considerable reduction of the number of cases of the disease. This result is particularly good in a country where, as in India, hygienic measures are applied with difficulty and where other epidemics are prevalent. Whilst Pasteur's methods have not been followed by favourable results, the simultaneous method has frequently met with success. This is in accord with the view of Marai who does not consider Pasteur's inoculation to be certain in its action, and who considers that the defective method of culture of attenuated virus in Paris is responsible for this. The advantage this method possesses over all other inoculations with culture products is that the protection it gives lasts over a year, and it may be carried out at once and immunity be obtained in 12 days. This is the method employed in Germany and in other parts of Europe and according to the obser- vations published up to date, both the preventive and curative inoculations.
14 have given excellent results. As a curative, serum alone is employed in large doses (50 to 100 c. c.). The intravenous method with 30 to 50 c. c., of serum is especially recommended. The serum kept in a cool place, away from light, is said to remain good for years. If the inoculation is carried out at the beginning of the attack especially when administered intravenously, we may be practically certain of a favourable result. 87. We may, in addition, at the commencement of the epidemic immedia- tely carry out a serum alone inoculation with 10 to 15 c. c., which confers a certain amount of immunity. It is true that this immunity does not persist for long and after a few weeks the simultaneous method should be carried out. 88. Experiments are being made in the Muktesar Laboratory by this method and the results obtained in cattle are very encouraging. I think, so far as can at present be seen, that this will be the most suitable method for use in India; but we must know far more about the prevalence of the disease in our districts, be able to obtain early information of outbreaks which must be confirmed by microscopical and bacteriological examination, and ascertain where the disease is enzootic and justifies the simultaneous method being adopted, before any steps are taken to use it for general use in the field. Moreover, should it be found advisable to carry it out, we shall require local provincial laboratories with well trained Bacteriologists in charge of them and a more highly trained subordinate native establishment. 89. It is evident that we cannot afford to entrust the materials in the hands of inexperienced men nor can we afford to inoculate unless the diagnosis is confirmed. Before a decision is come to, therefore, we must have the reputed enzootic zones carefully examined, the disease correctly diagnosed and the losses to which it gives rise recorded. This will take some time to carry out. Full reports will be required dealing with the question from all points of view. I have asked Superintendents to map out this disease gradually, especially noting outbreaks where the diagnosis has been confirmed and have advised in the meantime that serum be only used in undoubted outbreaks and the results be carefully watched. 90. The serum has been adopted this year in 123 outbreaks and 6,327 cattle and 6 horses have been inoculated in the United Provinces, 8,461 in Madras and 10,148 bovines and 105 horses in Eastern Bengal and Assam, the results being reported to have been good. 91. Black Quarter.15 Madras 3,544, and Bengal 2,976. We can do nothing so far to cope with the spread of this disease and have to confine ourselves to treating the worst cases. 93. Surra.16 98. Other diseases said to be contagious have also been observed:17 total number of cases treated of about 85,000 which may be regarded as satis- factory, especially as it represents in many cases work carried out for only a part, in some cases only a few months of the year. Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries. 108. The number of these institutions, the Veterinary Assistants employed and the cases treated is given in Table V. There has been an increase of 21 dispensaries during the year and the number of Veterinary Assistants employed was, 342 against 317 last year. 109. In the United Provinces, 6 new dispensaries have been opened, i.e., one each at Aligarti, Mainpuri, Etah, Basti, Banda and Bijnor. In Eastern Bengal and Assam18 Government being 30 against 20 and of Local Boards 458 against 386. The increase is nearly entirely confined to the Punjab 87 and United Provinces 32. In Madras 13 were added. In the North-West Frontier Province 4, in Rajputana 2 and in the Central Provinces 1. 114. The progress in the Punjab and United Provinces is satisfactory and as a definite scheme has been adopted in the former province we may look for a steady increase annually. The year has not been a very favourable one for turning bulls out and only 69 out of 95 the sanctioned number were requisitioned from Hissar as it was not advisable to turn them out in the districts, when great scarcity prevailed. The Dajil breed will be supplied in future to the Muzaffargarh district. 115. In Bombay, the scheme initiated for providing stock bulls for villages in the Ahmednagar district by giving conjoint &quot;tagai&quot; for the purpose of purchasing them proved a success and 39 more Khillari bulls were obtained at the Maswad Fair. This scheme, which appears a good one, might perhaps be extended with benefit. These bulls are not shown in the return. 116. In the United Provinces, in addition to the 32 bulls obtained, there was a considerable demand which could not be met. 117. In Bengal, requests were received from many District Boards, Government estates, etc., and Eastern Bengal and Assam to provide them with bulls for improving the breed of cart bullocks, but the serious shortage of suitable animals for the purpose has prevented the Superintendent from complying with them, except in the case of Ranchi, Midnapur, Angul and Belgachia to which 10, 8, 2 and 4 were supplied. 118. It is noted that Brahmini bulls are being taken away by butchers from Eastern Bengal and Assam and the lower districts of Bengal. If they only took the useless ones perhaps complaints would not arise, but it is reported that the evil is assuming such proportions that it is likely to have a serious effect on cattle breeding. Branding with a Government brand and taking over by Government would put a stop to this, as I believe at present the bulls are no ones property. In Madras, 8 young bulls of the Ongole breed were purchased by Government and turned loose in the herds. 119. The maintenance of small herds of really good representative animals of the best local breeds and the distribution of bulls to their villages would do a great deal towards improving cattle breeding in India and is worthy of the consideration of the landed gentry. Good cattle cost no more to keep than bad ones and are of infinitely more service. Bull rearing and breeding Farms and Depots. 120. Table IX gives the main results of the working of the Provincial Cattle Farms which were working at Chharodi in Ahmedabad district, Pusa and Sripur (Hathwa Raj) in Bengal, Tilankheri (Nagpur.) Powar Kheri (Hoshangabad) in the Central Provinces, and Upper Shillong in Eastern. Bengal and Assam. Besides these, two others have been at work in the Court of Wards Estates at Jetpur on the borders of Nagpur and the Chhindwara district and another at Kindri started by the Deputy Commissioner in the Mandla district. Another is working at Kalimpong in Bengal but no details are available in regard to it. 121. Bengal.19 Hathwa Raj estate alone. The cattle are of the local breed and the young stock are most promising. No bulls have so far been distributed but seven will be available next year. 122. Bombay.20 Sheep breeding. 131. A considerable amount of information has been collected in this office regarding the attempts which have already been made in different parts of India to improve the breed of sheep for both mutton, and wool. 132 North-West Frontier Province.21 for ponies against 50 and 39.45 respectively last year. The services of the horse stallions were in great demand in the United Provinces 53.9, Punjab 56, and North-West Frontier Province 57.25, whilst in Bombay 43.39 was the average per stallion employed. The average for pony stallions was also good in the first three Provinces, 52.2, 52 and 48.2, respectively. But in Bombay it only reached 30.61, Burma 23.2, Madras 21, whilst the stallion in Bengal did not cover a single mare. Of the 99 donkeys on the register, 62 were employed at stud during the year and covered 3,435 mares or an average of 55.4 per stallion against 50.5 last year. 139. Mule breeding is a most important industry and it is hoped that the addition of the new Jacks to the registers will result in an increase of useful mules in Northern India. There has been an all round improvement in horse, pony and mule breeding which may be taken as an indication that the industry is in a satisfactory condition. 140. The average cost of feed, keep, attendance, etc., of horse, pony and donkey stallions is given in Table XII. There has been an all round increase, except in Bengal and Madras, which is attributed to the rise in price of forage during the year. Fairs and Shows. 141. Table XIII gives the abstract particulars regarding Horse fairs and Shows held in the non-selected districts. It has been a particularly bad year for the success of these gatherings owing to the dearness of forage and, in some cases, the prevalence of plague. It has consequently only been possible to hold 14 Fairs; those at Karnal, Ludhiana and Muzafargarh in the Punjab, and Ahmedabad in Bombay had to be abandoned. There were no Fairs held in the United Provinces, Sind, Bombay, Madras, Central Provinces or Burma. 142. The attendance was comparatively small, only 11,629 animals being present. The greatest falling off appears to have occurred in Bengal where, although only one Fair less was held, the attendance fell from 28,035 to 6,402. There was a considerable fall in the number attending the two Fairs in the North-West Frontier Province, viz., 593 against 1,159. In the Punjab and Rajputana, the attendance was about normal. The number competing for prizes was 1,907 and 7 medals and Rs. 4,692 out of Rs. 7,267 actually avail- able, were awarded as prizes. 143. Table XIV gives the abstract particulars regarding Cattle Fairs and Shows. 72 were held against 73 last year. The amount actually awarded in prizes was Rs. 30,385-11-6 out of the available Rs. 33,801-13-0 Fifty three medals were also distributed. The number of animals competing for prizes was 14,731 against 11,077 last year. The total number of stock present is reported to have been 763,835 against 836,067 last year. The amount realized in fees was Rs. 1,19,670-14-5 against Rs. 1,36,989-11-6 last year. 144. As a rule the Shows are held in connection with Fairs at which large numbers of animals are brought for sale by breeders and dealers. In Madras, however, a number of real Cattle Shows are held by the Agricultural Associ- ations of Madura, Coimbatore, Ganjam, Godaveri, Vizagapatam and Guntur. These Shows were held this year in Madura, Tiruppur, Behrampur, Coconada, Kottavalsa and Ongole. They appear to have proved a success and to be worthy of substantial encouragement. From the breeders point of view, the Ongole and Tiruppur shows were a very great success and great interest appears to be taken in them. The exhibits were good and there is no doubt that the gatherings are of considerable benefit in exciting emulation amongst local breeders and tending towards the production of better stock. 145. The Ongole breed is decidedly a good one and the large purchases of the best young stock for foreign countries cannot be overlooked. If a good market is created and prices rule high, as they do, the effect on the breeding of superior stock should be good. With the object of providing the best avail- able Ongole bulls for the breeders in the district, it is satisfactory to note that Government have recognised the advisability of purchasing some of the best male stock exhibited each year, and eight young bulls were purchased and turned loose this year. The highest price paid for a young bull was Rs. 350.
22 IV.-SUBORDINATE ESTABLISHMENT. Numbers, supervision and work peform- ed. 146. Table VII gives the strength of the subordinate establishments as they stood at the end of the year. Very important progress has been made in the reorganization of the subordinate Civil Veterinary Department during the year. It has been made provincial and pensionable in Madras, Bengal and Eastern Bengal, and a scheme for placing it on the same footing in the Central Provinces is under consideration. The old system was found in these provin- ces, now that the importance of dealing with epidemics has been recognised, to be too slow in developing and to be too inelastic to allow of proper concent- ration of forces being made. It is obvious that to cope with an epidemic of rinderpest for instance, extensive preventive inoculations must be made as soon as possible otherwise it will go on spreading. If we cannot concentrate a sufficient number of Veterinary Assistants to inoculate the incontact animals it is not likely that we shall limit spread. The difficulties previously experien- ced will now to a great extent be obviated. The Department will develop more rapidly and owing to the establishment being more mobile, the necessary concentration of forces will, when a sufficient number of Assistants is forth- coming, be more easily made. In the United Provinces too sanction to the expansion of the Department has been accorded and the pay of Veterinary Assistants has been improved. The pay of the establishment has been improved in the North-West Frontier Province, bringing it into line with the Punjab. 147. The following table will show at a glance the sanctioned establish- ment of the various Provinces, the numbers added and the strength at the end of the year :23 148. It will be seen that some Provinces are practically at full strength whilst others are only just making a beginning and progress is slow in them. Doubtless, now that the services have been placed on a more solid basis, im- provement in recruiting in Bengal and Eastern Bengal and Assam will take place. In Bombay it is very slow at present and it is possible that the starting pay of veterinary Assistants will need revision. The progress made in recruiting has been satisfactory, excepting in Bombay. It is stated that the graduates of all other colleges have obtained employment. There are therefore no more graduates obtainable until the Colleges can turn them out. The supply is at present very limited and it will take many years before the sanctioned strength can be reached. The demand for graduates trained in the vernacular College is out of all proportion to the supply and it has been ascertained that Lahore will be unable to supply more than half the requirements to replace vacancies when the civil establishments are at their full strength. 149. In order to assist Burma, sanction has been obtained to the training of Inspectors and Deputy Suprintendents for that Province at the Bengal Veterinary College where a few United Provinces students are also trained. To promote education in veterinary science in Coorg, scholarships have been granted to students natives of the province at the Madras College. PART B24 157. The insufficiency of the superior staff for the purpose of research in addition to the very heavy work entailed by the preparation of serum, has already been brought to notice. It has been found impossible to undertake very necessary research work in the field on account of the lack of trained officers on the laboratory staff. Such research work as it has been found possible to carry out in the laboratory has been small, but no opportunity has been missed to do what was possible. 158. Some revision of the subordinate establishment maintained at the Laboratory has been carried out. An important and very necessary matter which has received attention during the year is the improvement of the library. The Government of India have sanctioned the sum of Rs. 20,000 for the purchase of books and sets of journals and a library allowance of Rs. 2,500 per annum. 159. Preparation of Sera. Rinderpest Anti-Serum.25 favourable circumstances a maximum of more than 5 lacs doses cannot be ex- ceeded at present. This amount represents the maximum output that the staff and machinery can cope with, and it is further confirmed by the limi- tation of fodder and water supply and also by the available supply of Hill Bulls. 163. During the months of January, February and early part of March it was found that Hill Bulls were lost owing to severe weather on the road, also experience has proved that the serum prepared at this time is of very inferior quantity. For these reasons, the serum preparation work will be reduced as far as possible during this period. The question, therefore, of establishing another laboratory for the manufacture of serum in Southern India is under consideration, 164. Anthrax Anti-Serum.26 169.

It is satisfactory to note, however, that notwithstanding all the difficulties we have been able to carry on and maintain the stock in excellent condition during the year and have 59,000 maunds of dry fodder in hand. 198. Foot and mouth disease was very troublesome and two outbreaks occurred during the year. It was very mild but caused some deaths in calves. Blackleg was also prevalent causing considerable loss, and arrangements have now been made to inoculate all the young stock with vaccine as a preventive. The disease has been enzootic on the farm for many years and as the virus is so tenacious of life, is a constant danger and source of loss. It is hoped that by means of inoculation we shall be able to reduce the mortality very consider- ably. 299. Breeding herd32 206. Cultivation bullocks.33 ment was discontinued and the mares either transferred or sold. The zebra stallion will be sold. 216. Pony mares for mule-breeding.34 may be exercised and efficiency maintained. The want of a few more officers is therefore now becoming acutely felt. In the circumstances, the work has fallen very heavily on the staff and I consider that they deserve great credit for the manner in which they have attempted to cope with it during the year. 225. We have been unable for want of officers to appoint Pathologists to the College laboratories although we fully recognise the necessity for doing so. Research work has been much hindered for want of properly qualified officers especially for field work, as the Laboratory staff has its hands full with the preparation of serum at present. 226. The reorganization of the various subordinate establishments will render progress as rapid as is possible in filling up the sanctioned posts. We can only employ Assistants as they graduate from the Colleges and as the number available is limited, it will take a good many years before the sanc- tioned strength can be reached in many provinces. 227. The appointment of Inspectors is reported to have resulted in con- siderable improvement in the work in districts. Wherever it has been possible, officers have visited more outbreaks of disease in districts, but in some cases little has been done in this most important matter. 228. The time has now arrived when every effort should be made to check the inoculation work reported by the subordinate staff in the field and to obtain more reliable information regarding the results in the field. 229. With reference to the remark made in the review of last year's An- nual Administration Report regarding the training of an indigenous staff quali- fied not only for administrative work but also for research, there can be no doubt whatever that in the future, when we begin to attempt to control diseases by means of living vaccines, we shall require a far more highly trained native agency for the purpose than we at present possess, and it will be necessary for us to train them in this country. But, in the meantime, the Department being a young and growing one, the demand for the services of such an agency does not justify the establishment of a special College for this purpose. I should be very glad indeed to see such a College started if sanction to a staff of well qualified teachers were obtained and if the graduates could be given work when they qualified. But I do not see how this could possibly be done at present, as the total strength of our cadre of Imperial officers is only 31 and the number of Deputy Superintendents sanctioned only 26. The demand for men to replace casualties would therefore be very small indeed and would certainly not justify the establishment of a properly equipped college for the purpose. The only method of obtaining men for research work would be to train them at home which would take 5 or 6 years and be a very costly process, besides which, it would be impossible to decide beforehand whether they would have the particu- lar bent and ability required in a research officer. 230. A Veterinary Conference composed of the senior &quot;Veterinary officers, the Inspector General of Agriculture, and the various Directors of Agriculture, was held in Calcutta in February last to discuss various questions connected with the establishment of a Board of Veterinary Science. Research, veteri- nary education, publications, cattle export, etc., were discussed and the Pro- ceedings duly submitted. The Conference was productive indirectly of much good as it gave Directors and Veterinary officers an opportunity of meeting together and discussing various questions in which we are all vitally concerned. 231. There can be no doubt that the important work performed by the Department is being daily more recognised, both by Provincial Governments and by the people. A number of new hospitals and dispensaries have been opened, horse and mule breeding continues to improve, the work done in the laboratory has been very satisfactory, more outbreaks of disease have been dealt with and incontact animals inoculated and the serum treatment of Rin- derpest is making steady headway. Considerable progress has been made in the study of camel diseases during the short time Mr. Leese has been employed
35 on the work. Moreover, our methods are appealing to Native States in the following of which small Veterinary Departments exist or are being started:36 TABLE I.
