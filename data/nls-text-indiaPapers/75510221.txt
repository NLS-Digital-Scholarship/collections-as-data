ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1910-1911. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. Preface Colonel H. T. Pease, C.I.E., was in charge of the Department from 1st April to 4th June 1910 when he pro- ceeded on furlough to Europe and was relieved by Lieut.-Colonel G. H. Evans, who officiated as Inspector-General from 5th June to the end of the year under report. 2. As usual, a coloured Map and the prescribed Tables are appended. The following alterations have been made in the map as compared with last year:2 Appointments. 1st April 1910. 31st March 1911. Remarks. Principal, Bombay Veterinary College M. H. Sowerby, Esq. . K.

A new ambulance was urgently needed and Babu Govindram Singhonia presented Rs. 1,000 for the purchase of a conveyance.

Lyperosia appear to have only once before on good grounds been suspected as a transmitter of Surra, i.e., amongst cattle in Rhodesia (King- horn and Montgomery). It is clear that this outbreak occurred in the absence of Tabanus, Stomoxys or other biting flies. Mr. Leese will no doubt avail himself of any opportunity afforded in endeavouring to establish his suspi- cions regarding Lyperosia. 27. Treatment of Surra.7 32. Towards the close of the year the buildings at Sohawa were reported to be approaching completion. It is anticipated they will be ready for occu- pation during the early part of the next official year. 33. Mr. Leese has been most energetic and unremitting in his labours to advance our knowledge of the diseases of the camel. Considering his work has been carried out often in trying circumstances, the success achieved is highly commendable. I consider we are greatly indebted to him not only for the zealous manner in which he has carried on his work but also for the pro- gress made. Other diseases. 34. Table IV shows the number of animals treated and castrated by Veterinary Assistants while on tour. The number of Veterinary Assistants employed has increased by nearly a hundred, viz., from 517 to 614. With the exception of Rajputana, additions have been made in every Province. Mad- ras shows 38 Veterinary Assistants now employed. In last year's report none were recorded. The work performed by Veterinary Assistants indicates general progress. Over 11,000 more villages were visited and the number of cases treated (excluding castrations) exceeded those of last year by 63,741. Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. 35. A reference to Table V will show that there were 327 Veterinary Dispensaries in working order during the year under report, against 408 in the previous year. Burma shows a decrease of 107 Dispensaries and Madras of 2. An explanation on this point will be given later. In Rajputana and Bengal the numbers remain the same as last year; in all other Provinces there is an increase shown. There is nothing special worthy of note under this head. Madras ex- plains that the reduction of two Veterinary Dispensaries is due to those at Ongole and Ellore having been transferred from Government administration to that of the District Boards of Guntur. Burma explains as follows in regard to the reduction of 107 Dispensaries:of the farm at Bettiah is declared unsuitable owing to its being subject to inundation, and the condition of the cattle is also reported to be 'not good.' 39. In the Bombay Presidency the results of the Northcote Cattle Farm at Chharodi continue to prove satisfactory. There is an increase in the number of live-stock at the Farm; several bulls were sold to the people of neighbouring villages. The number of calves dropped was nearly double that of the previous year. Mortality among the stock has been less than usual. Several improvements with regard to water supply, fencing of stock yards, repairs to buildings, closing of roads running through the farm, etc., have been carried out. An increased quantity of fodder is now maintained as a reserve. 40. Punjab reports that the requirements of nine districts amounting to 43 bulls, were fully met from the Government Cattle Farm at Hissar. Nine- teen bulls of the 'Dhanni' breed were purchased from Chakwal to meet the requirements of four districts. 41. Twenty-five (25) bulls were purchased by Local Boards in Eastern Bengal and Assam. It is reported that several indents were received from Local and District Boards for the supply of stud bulls, which could not be complied with as suitable animals were difficult to obtain. The Superintend- ent states that &quot;A scheme for the breeding of bulls has been drawn up and is now under consideration.&quot; 42. Owing to the increasing demand, the United Provinces also experi- ence the same difficulty regarding the insufficient supply of suitable stud bulls. Arrangements have been made for the supply of a certain number from the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, to meet immediate demands. It is expected that next year some 20 Hissar bulls will be available for issue to selected districts. As an experiment, a farm for rearing bulls has been started at Kheri. 43. The number of bulls in the North-West Frontier Province is reported to be quite inadequate. 44. In the Central Provinces, suggestions have been brought forward by the Superintendent regarding the establishment of a Demonstration Farm in Raipur, also the establishment of Farms on the Raigarh plateau and at Machurda in the Balaghat district. The farms at Kindri and Telinkheri are reported as being capable of considerable improvement, i.e., with regard to the class of animal bred, and general condition of the stock maintained. Bull rearing and breeding farms and depôts. 45. The main results of the working of Provincial Cattle Farms are shown in Table IX. The details fur- nished in the Valuation Statements which accompany Table IX, indicate the financial position of each farm. The total receipts amount to Rs. 20,181 against Rs. 23,919 last year; the expenditure is set down at Rs. 52,884 against Rs. 46,986 in the previous year, and the value of stock, grain and fodder at the close of the year is estimated at Rs 67,980 against Rs. 52,970 in the previous report. Punjab has fur- nished no particulars. Bengal states that the report on the Kalimpong. Farm was not received. Camel breeding. 46. The scheme for the encouragement of camel breeding by the award of prizes at Camel Fairs not meeting with the success hoped for, the question of its discontinuance is now before Government. 47. The subject dealt with in paragraph 181 of last year's report, regard- ing making available certain Surra free grazing areas with the view of en- couraging camel breeding in the Punjab, is also under consideration of the authorities concerned. Sheep breeding. 48. North-West Frontier Province and North Punjab.9 type by in-breeding, and hopes are entertained that the experiment, if care is taken in the selection of the ewes, will succeed. As regards mortality among the cross-bred sheep, it is stated that except when very young, i.e., the first few days after birth, they are constitutionally as strong as the indigenous sheep. The annual losses, however, in flocks generally, from such contagious diseases as Black Quarter, Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, Sheep scab and Foot and mouth disease, are stated to be very heavy. Twenty Merino rams are expected to arrive from New Zealand this year and will be entrusted to the care of influential Jagirdars and Zemindars. 49. Kangra and Kulu.10 IV.11 61.

As a result of the prompt action taken by the Superintendent, the outbreak of Rinderpest was rapidly checked and only one death was reported. An outbreak of Sheep pox gave considerable trouble. The Merino sheep and half-breds suffered from a severe form of the disease; a number of animals succumbed and several of those which recovered were useless and had to be destroyed. 75. The difficulty in obtaining adequate labour to work the Farm seems to be increasing every year. Some reasons which may be tending towards bringing about this state of affairs are as follows, viz., two lines of railway under construction, three cotton mills at work in Hissar, higher wages paid by the Public Works Department and Zemindars, the ravages of plague and malaria, especially among the Mali class, and the visits of recruiting parties. A number of the hands now employed on the Farm are mere lads 10 to 14 years of age, hence the work of supervision is greatly increased. It is quite probable that at any time it may be necessary for Government to consider the question of granting a general rise in the scale of wages. The Superin tendent is at times very hard pressed to procure sufficient hands to carry on the farm work. It was hoped that providing quarters for a certain number of men might induce them to accept permanent employ; so far, however, the scheme has not proved a great success. 76. The excellent work performed last year in the matter of raising the level of roads, repairing and erecting walls, clearing and remodelling water- courses, extending cultivation and planting trees has been continued during the year under report, and the success attained in spite of the difficulty in the matter of labour reflects credit on all concerned. As might be expected, pigs and other wild animals continue to do damage in the cultivated areas. In the Bir a large area which was barren or overrun with useless grasses has been ploughed and Anjan grass seed sown. Machinery and rolling-stock are kept in excellent order. The buildings are old and require overhauling. A Committee will assemble next year to report on them. A post-mortem house has been erected during the year. 77. As the present state of the stock as well as all increases and decreases is clearly indicated in Table XVI, it would appear superfluous to enter into details regarding the several classes of animals maintained on the Farm. It may perhaps be sufficient to state that there is a continued improvement in the stock bred there. Sheep breeding is doing fairly well. The Merinos and half-breds suffer considerably from the heat and attacks of flies. The results of donkey and mule breeding are shown in Table XVII. 78. The annual expenditure connected with the working of the Farm as shown in Table XVIII will be seen to have been Rs. 1,06,366-7-8; receipts Rs. 86,857-14-3 and the valuation of stock, fodder, machinery, etc., Rs. 3,87,652-12-1, against expenditure Rs. 1,13,639-1-0, receipts Rs. 1,02,027-13-7 and valuation of stock, etc., Rs. 3,65,690-7-1 for the previous year. The decrease in expenditure is roughly Rs. 7,000. The receipts show a falling off of Rs. 15,000 mainly due to the less number of animals sold; the valuation of stock, etc., has however increased by nearly Rs. 22,000. If the fact that a large amount of the stock bred at Hissar is issued to Government Departments at prices very far below that obtainable from pri- vate purchasers or in the open market is taken into consideration, the Farm may be said to be practically self-supporting. 79. Lieut.-Colonel Farmer has as usual worked hard and afforded ample proof of his being particularly well suited to fill the appointment of Superin- tendent. Any success attained is mainly due to his zeal and untiring super- vision. He records his appreciation of the good work performed by his staff more particularly Lieut. R. Morris, Farm Overseer, and Mr. E. MacCutchan, the Farm Bailiff.
14 80. There is little doubt that the work has increased to an extent that the Superintendent is much overworked. If in the interests of the Farm alone, it would seem expedient that a second officer be appointed permanently to be trained under Lieut.-Colonel Farmer who stands alone in his knowledge and experience of the Hissar Farm. Should any circumstance arise necessi- tating Colonel Farmer relinquishing charge of the farm, unless there is an officer thoroughly conversant with the various duties connected with this special charge ready to immediately take up the work, I fear it would not be long before neglect of this precaution was very forcibly impressed upon us. Expenditure of the Department. PART C.15 It certainly cannot be done by writing from head-quarters. It is rarely in Colleges that opportunity occurs of affording pupils practical instruction in that all-important work dealing with epidemics, and the same remark applies equally to the local hospitals. It can only be imparted in the villages, graz- ing grounds, etc., while epidemics are prevailing and as soon as possible after the outbreak has occurred. To carry out such work a Superintendent must be willing and free to leave his head-quarters at any time, and himself super- vise and help in as many outbreaks as possible. When there are no epidemics Superintendents can find plenty to do in looking after the work of Assistants and instructing them how to deal with outbreaks at the onset, before their superiors can arrive, and when they must necessarily act on their own initia- tive.
