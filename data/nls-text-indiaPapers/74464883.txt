REPORT ON THE TREATMENT OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA BY JOHN MURRAY, M. D., INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF HOSPITALS, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. Cholera is a specific disease marked by characteristic symptoms which run a defined course, varying according to the intensity of the attack and the stage of the disease. It spreads and multiplies. It is reproduced, and therefore it belongs to the vital or animated kingdom; but whether vegetable or animal is uncertain. It has recently been reported as having been detected as a fungus, by the microscope, and again this fungus has been considered as merely one of the signs of decomposition on which the germ, of the disease flourishes. Practically the most important point, viz., the circumstances which promote or restrict the propagation of the germ, apply equally to specimens from either kingdom. The object of this investigation is to discover what facilitates its dissemi- nation, and increases its reproductive power, and what practical means have proved useful to enable the human body to avoid or resist the action of the poison, and remedy its injurious effects. The action of the choleraic poison on the system will be most clearly defined by tracing the disease from its most intense form, through milder forms and various stages, where there has been time for the development of secondary symptoms. It is only from a clear understanding on this point that a rational system of treatment can be founded, and the action of the remedies explained. In no disease has there been such diversity of opinion as of cholera, and in none has such a multiplicity of op- posite remedies been so strongly urged. The urgency of the danger, the calls of the patient and friends for the remedies usually useful in exhaustion in other diseases, combined with the desire to rescue the patient from imminent danger, naturally leads the inex- perienced physician to employ increased doses or stronger remedies, or even in despair, to the use of any violent remedies which may have a chance of success. This is a natural impulse, but liable to lead to danger in this peculiar disease. This is one of the most important points in the treatment of cholera, in which the accumulated opinions of so large a number of independent witnesses, as are collected in the present investigation, are peculiarly valuable. The great and sudden changes which follow the different stages of the disease, have led to the conclusion that the remedies simultaneously employed caused the changes; whilst possibly they were merely insufficient to prevent their taking place. In ague, alcoholic stimuli do not materially shorten the cold, and they are unquestionably injurious in the subsequent hot stage. In cholera alcoholic stimuli in large quantities often prevent re-action taking place; or should it arise they cause violent or dangerous symptoms to supervene. Cholera in its most intense form is rarely seen. I have heard it called ground or earth cholera in the European barracks, and kalla murees (black death) by the natives. The patient is suddenly struck down with extreme prostration or collapse, without pain or prominent symptom, only an uneasy sink- ing or heat in the stomach, with thirst or a desire for water,-the countenance is livid,-the eyes congested and sunken,-the voice broken,-the skin cold, blue and covered with clammy perspiration,-the pulse feeble or imperceptible,-the breathing slow labored and intermitting,-the intervals gradually become longer, till breathing at last ceases and death ensues. Sometimes these cases prove fatal within two or three hours of the attack. In less intense attacks the feeling of prostration is followed by one or more watery congee-like discharges, with burning pain in the epigastrium, cramps of the extremities, and profuse cold perspiration. This congee vomiting and purging often ceases whilst restlessness comes on. The heart flutters feebly, the breathing becomes slower, with longer intervals, and at last ceases.
2                                                                                      SYMPTOMS. In many instances there is an ineffective effort at re-action, when the congee vomitting or purging returns with increased animation ; but only for a short time. When the disease continues and re-action progresses favorably, the restlessness subsides, the breathing becomes easier and more regular, the burning pain in the stomach disappears, the pulse becomes stronger, the color improves, the evacuations become colored and less frequent, and sleep ensues. Bile and urine are secreted, the bowels become regular, the appetite returns, and only slight debility remains. This is the regular uncomplicated course of the disease. In some cases the urine does not appear,-the bile is dark green,-the vomitting or looseness continues,-the skin becomes hot and dry, and the head painful, with tendency to delirium, or coma. As these sequel do not form an essential part of the natural course of the disease, it is important, in regulat- ing the treatment, to ascertain the cause of the complications, whether arising from the retention of the effete portion of the blood during protracted collapse,-from the partial retention of the poison,-from its injurious action on the organs,-or from the action of the remedies employed during the previous course of the disease. In ordinary cases there is painless light colored diarrha for several hours, or sometimes for several days, before the characteristic congee-like stools appear, with suppression of urine; and the disease then progresses as previ- ously described. When the collapse rapidly subsides, or when it does not supervene, weakness alone remains, and the natural secretions of the liver and kidneys are soon restored. In the mildest form of the attack, there is a dull feeling of depression or malaise with sinking in the epigastrium and want of appetite,-torpor of the bowels, with a desire for stimulants. These symptoms are felt by almost all who are in contact with cholera patients in severe epidemics. During this period if the person be subjected to great exhaustion, from a long march, from exposure, from watching or fear, or if a strong purgative be given, the usual symptoms of cholera with collapse will generally supervene. Many such instances have corne under my observation, and many more have been reported. The poison was in the system, and brought into activity by the depressing or exhausting influence superadded; instead of being quietly thrown off, as in general, by the healthy natural secretions. The action of the poison on the body is the same in character in all these forms of the disease. The symptoms are merely modified by the intensity of the poison, which induces diminished action of the sympathetic or involun- tary nerves : amounting in the most intense form to total paralysis. The voluntary nerves and mental energy remain unaffected in the earlier stages. Whether the sudden accession of collapse which supervenes or the diarrha arises from the natural development of the germ of the poison, or whether the power of resistance being diminished, its action becomes more powerful, or both these circumstances combine to produce it, is uncertain. The disease may be cut short or arrested in the first or second stage this has led to calling the second stage a distinct disease. Cases of diarrha abound during cholera epidemics. When the evacuations become more watery or congee-like, with cramps, the disease gets the name of choleraic diarrha. These symptoms generally precede the congee stools with collapse, which are considered to constitute cholera. The concealment of the real nature of the disease, for fear of alarming the patient, is followed by hopeless despair when collapse supervenes. There are numerous instances recorded, by the highest and most reliable authorities, of intense attacks of epidemic cholera appearing immediately after the arrival of people who were suffering from diarrha, who came from places where cholera was raging. The symptoms in the original cases sometimes subsided without advancing to collapse, though they more generally proceeded to that stage. Choleraic diarrha is a stage of cholera as much as collapse. The name should be discontinued, as liable to lead to the neglect of the precautions required to prevent the spread of the disease. A knowledge of the circumstances which predispose to the action, or development of the disease, and the means by which it is disseminated, is essential to its comprehensive treatment. In the reports submitted, some
SANITARY MEASURES.                                                                            3 of the writers state that medicine has no power in cholera. Others say that the attention should be devoted to the prevention of the disease, as medicine can do little in its cure. Though strong medicines have little power to do good during one stage, they may, if improperly used, do much injury. The disease may he prevented reaching that stage, and when that has passed, much may often he clone to remove its effects and to restore health. All the resources of medical science may he brought to bear on the treatment of this terrible disease. The observations of European and American authors have not been overlooked in forming the practical conclusions which I now with diffidence beg to submit. SANITARY MEASURES. It is allowed by all that defects in the purity of the air and water,-over- crowding,-improper food or clothing,-bad conservancy, and all sanitary defects which act prejudicially on the general health, predispose to the action of the cholera poison. These defects have existed, and still exist, in many parts of the world without the appearance of cholera : still experience shows that in this contaminated soil or atmosphere, the choleraic poison when imported flourishes and spreads; whilst its progress or development is stunted or limited where these sanitary defects do not exist. Overcrowding and imperfect ventila- tion appear to be peculiarly favorable to the spread of the disease. There have been numerous illustrations on this point on boardship,-in jails and cantonments,-at holy places and fairs, where large crowds collect, and at marriage and funeral feasts in India. In proportion as the conservancy arrangements were defective, the attack was generally more violent and ex- tensive ; but the most efficient arrangements will not always avert an attack. The human body appears to be the chief medium of reproduction, or mul- tiplication and dissemination of the poison. This is fully proved by the history of the progress of the epidemic attacks in India, Europe, and America. It is the opinion arrived at in the report of the International Congress at Constantinople in 1866. The history of the Hurdwar epidemic in 1867 showed that the disease radiated with the pilgrims from one focus in all directions from 300 to 700 miles, advancing in strict conformity to their rate of travelling, and being accelerated by the railway to Mooltan. There are numerous well authenticated cases of the poison having been mixed with the water of wells and tanks, those using the water being attacked by the disease. It appears to be propagated in and near drains or sewers. Decomposition facilitates the dissemination and probably aids in the reproduction or ger- mination of the poison. There is abundant concurrent evidence that contact with the evacuations from cholera patients, or with articles of clothing, &c., contaminated by them, and using public latrines, have been followed by attacks of the disease. In some instances the poison appears to have been inhaled from the atmosphere into the lungs, from close approximation to the sick, or from residence in close ill ventilated rooms, or barracks where many cholera patients were confined. Visiting places recently occupied by choiera cases, as buildings and camping grounds, has in many instances been followed by attacks of the disease. The period during which the locality remains dangerous varies according to circumstances. The shorter the interval, and the more confined the space, the greater the danger. I am not aware of any instance in which it has remained attached to the open ground so long as one year. Cholera camping grounds, which had in the meantime been cultivated, were occupied at ?gra the following year without injury. In several instances which have come under my observation, the disease re-appeared, or was aggravated in hospitals or buildings occupied by cholera patients the previous year at the same season.* * The following report from Dr. Rice, Assistant Surgeon of  Jubbulpore, illustrales this point :-Three fatal cases I cholera appeared in a gang of coolies working on the road 29 miles from Jubbulpore. They \ill\ to a place two \ill\ where four more cases occurred within the next two days, also fatal. They then dispersed. Some ten days after, a party of pilgrims, en route from Nagpore to the Ganges, encamped for a few hours at the latter spot to cook and can their mid-day meal, and then came on to Jubbulpore. Two days after resting there, and just after their arrival, it appeared amongst them and within the next 48 hours nine cases occurred, of which three proved fatal. 2

This is established by the personal experience of many medical officers. It is seldom possible to obtain reliable statistical information on this point, as the intervals between the epidemics have generally been long, and the survivors have been scattered before another attack. The most authentic information on this subject is to be obtained from the Indian jails. There were seven severe epidemics in the central prison at Agra in the years 1851, 1856, 1860, 1861, 1862, 1863, and 1865. The details of the two attacks in 1851 and 1856 were destroyed in the mutiny.  Those of the five subsequent attacks have been carefully abstracted from the jail re- cords. It is highly probable that many of the cases entered as Re-admitted during the first year had been discharged before the poison was completely thrown off, as they were only one or two days out of hospital ; but this objection cannot apply to those re-admitted in subsequent years. Table No. I shows that the proportion attacked is greater, but the mortality slightly less, in those who had previously been attacked than in those exposed for the first time.* The period of incubation varies according to the intensity of the poison and the state of the recipient. In a small quantity it produces malaise, which may pass off without active symptoms in two or three days ; but violent symptoms with collapse may be induced by fatigue or purgative medicine. It is generally during this stage that cholera is disseminated over the world, particularly during pilgrimages in India. In some instances the recipient is suddenly attacked whilst in contact with the affected. But in general there is an interval of 12 or 24 hours after imbibing the poison before active symp- toms appear. Two days are not generally exceeded ; but it is sometimes four days before the disease shows active signs. There is a marked coincidence, if no stronger connection, between the season of the year and the appearance of the disease in most countries ; but individual cases appear and the disease sometimes spreads at unusual seasons, 'It generally prevails in the warm and damp months ; but it has very frequently raged during the hot dry winds of India, with a temperature of 120 or 130 F., and also in the cold frost of Russia with a temperature below zero. It prevails most in level low lands ; but I have seen it at Landour and Simla, upwards of 7,000 feet above the level of the sea. During the rainy season in India, cholera occasionally assumes an inter- mittent type, probably from the combined action of the cholera and miasmatic poisons. The hour of attack is about 3 in the morning, and about the same hour in the afternoon a change for the better or worse takes place. Profuse cold clammy perspiration, like the sweating sickness of the dark ages, is the characteristic of this form of the disease. Cholera epidemics have been, most severe in cities, and in the parts of onntonnients which are devoid of trees. There are several instances on record where moving cholera camps into topes of trees was followed by marked benefit- The subject is worthy of more attention ; but trees alone do not prevent the dissemination of the disease, as it continued to prevail at Simla (which is covered with trees) for several months in 1867. I have observed the immediate cessation of attacks among the troops at Agra from crossing the river Jumna, and several similar instances are recorded. The severe attacks at Kurrachee in 1856, and at Peshawur in 1867, were preceded by severe dust-storms with thunder. At Hurdwar, in 1867, and in numerous other instances, the attacks have been preceded by thunder and rain ; whilst in other instances the disease has subsided after severe storms ; but these are not sanitary agents under our control. PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES. There are two or three advocates of the theory of the spontaneous gen- eration of this specific poison from defective sanitary arrangements. This may originate from observations limited to local outbreaks ; but it fails to explain    The   table  shows  the  number  of oases admitted under the  separate heads of cholera and diarrha  and also  as combined  under one heading,   which  I   consider conveys the   most clear   indication of the relative  sickness induced and 304, or 2.752 per cent. Out of a strength of 11,046 during the five epidenies, 1.598, or 14.467 per cent., were attached and 304, or 2.752 per cent. died. Out of 2,026 survivors of attacks, subjected to the influence of the disease during the first and three  subsequent attacks, 296, or 14.610 per cent., were attacked, of whom 44, or 2.172 per cent., died
PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES.                                                                       5 the course of the disease over the world. A specific germ is required for the production of a specific poison, though peculiar circumstances may render it more or less prolific. In theory, protection from this specific disease is simple, viz., to destroy, isolate, or exclude the generating source, and thus prevent its spreading ; but in practice this cannot he carried out ; at least the means hitherto employed have not been successful. The rigid discipline available in jails and military cantonments has, doubt- less, warded off attacks in many instances ; so also have precautions been taken under quarantine rules in open countries ; but they have generally failed. The experience of the world has proved that the cunning of individuals, or the corruption of the guards, will always leave a weak point through which, like the heel of Achilles, the fatal poison may enter. It will remain to be considered how far present quarantine regulations could be extended to afford reason- able hope of protection without intolerable restraint. Though perfect immunity cannot be secured, much good may be done by measures which ought not to be neglected, and which bear especially on the subject of this report, of which one of the most important is the accommoda- tion and comfort of the sick. They are a source of danger to those near them, and it is not prudent to collect them in ordinary hospital wards with other patients. Even special wards in ordinary hospitals would bring the disease in dangerous proximity to the other sick. Special hospitals are very desirable, and, as a general rule, tents are the most suitable. They can contain but few inmates in each, and the ground can be left when vitiated. Wooden sheds or straw huts may be made more comfortable for wet cold weather. Communica- tion between the outside world and the inmates should be restricted to near relations. The attendants should limit their intercourse outside as much as possible. Perfect isolation is impracticable, but that should indicate the course to be followed. Having observed the injurious effects of neglected or defective sanitary rules, the first object on the approach or appearance of cholera is to ascertain if these have been efficiently carried out, and, if not, so far as practicable, to have the defects or omissions rectified ; special attention being paid to those points where the communicable peculiarity of the disease may come into action. The water supply requires the most careful supervision to prevent its contamination from the evacuations or emanations from cholera subjects. The wells or springs from which drinking water is supplied should be protected from contamination from the surface and from infiltration from cesspools or sewers. In India the tanks in which the people bathe and procure drinking water should be guarded, and travellers or pilgrims watched during epidemic seasons. There were two remarkable instances during the "Hurdwar epidemic" of the inhabitants being attacked by cholera on the second day after the poison had been communicated to the village tanks : in one instance from a pilgrim suffering from cholera having bathed in it, and remained on the banks during                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  O the day ; and in the other after the clothes of a man who had died from cholera were washed in it. The effect of boiling contaminated water is questionable. The trouble and expense of the process is considerable. It concentrates the salts and renders the water unpalatable, so that, on the whole, boiling is not advisable. Public latrines are a source of great danger, unless most carefully super- vised with strict attention to the reception and the speedy removal of the contents and the free use of disinfectants. The dry-earth system is the best. 'The contents should be buried in trenches at some distance from the station. Burning would more effectually destroy the poison ; but it requires more complicated means and the process is less convenient (especially in camp) than burying, and the latter has proved efficacious. Overcrowding, assembling large numbers of men in the sanie room, and imperfect ventilations are sources of the greatest danger, and require to be re- medied by every practicable means ; more especially as the place or building may form an active agent in disseminating the disease. The first indication is to diminish the number of the occupants of the building, and to provide accommodation for those removed, without endangering unaffected localities
6                                                           PRECAUTIONARY  MEASURES-REMOVAL. or people. In India this is practicable for troops and prisoners, and it has been frequently effected with the most marked advantage. It has also been carried out in small villages by the inhabitants deserting their houses, and living in the open air in the surrounding country. They prefer living under trees. This is less practicable in large towns; but much may be done, besides conservancy arrangements, in removing the sick from their houses to special hospitals, and providing cover for some of the inhabitants of crowded places. In India means of carrying out the removal of the troops are available. The importance of this subject has attracted much attention of late years, and its interest will be increased by the extension of the disease to Europe and America, where it is to be expected cholera will continue a permanent resi- dent  as  in India.    Removal from  barracks into tents has been occasionally practised for many years.  It was systematically carried out by me during seven severe epidemics at Agra in 1851, 1856, 1860, 1861, 1862, 1863, and at Umballa in 1867.    It was not recognized as an imperative measure till the report of the Cholera Commission in 1862.   Since that date removal has been carried out with decided advantage as shown by the  accompanying Table No.   II, where  the admissions among the European Troops of the Bengal Presidency in the two quinquennial periods before removal amounted, respectively, to 25.58 and 21.05 per mille, and only to 7.04 since 1863.    The admissions in 20 stations attacked in the three epidemics of 1856, 1860, and 1861 amounted to 123.17 per mille, whilst in the three epidemics of 1862, 1863, and 1867 in 31 stations it only amounted to 47.34 per mille.    Table No. II shows a similar diminution since 1863 in the admissions among the Native Troops from 7.50 per mille to 4.57, and among the Native prisoners from 31.16 to 22.38 per mille.    Table No. III shows the result of seven epidemic attacks in the central prison at Agra, where I introduced removal in 1851, and gained experience  in  subsequent  attacks. During the first three attacks, the admissions were 392.29 per mille, and the deaths 60.53 per mille.    In the four subsequent attacks the admissions were 68.99 per mille, and the deaths 17.02 per mille after removal was fully organized. As extensive sanitary improvements have been going on since 1862, the diminution of the numbers attacked in each epidemic may be attributed to these in part ; but there was clearly some other power in force to produce the sudden improvement shown in the last period. The diminished sickness from fevers, which doubtless depended on sanitary reforms, was steady and continu- ous during the three periods, whilst in cholera there was but slight change during the first two, and there was a sudden diminution to less than one-third during the last period subsequent to the regulated use of Removal. Table No. IV shows the immediate beneficial result of removal in averting the attack in more than half of the instances in which it was carried out in 1867. This measure has clearly not aggravated the number of attacks of other diseases, as was anticipated.    On the contrary, in several instances,  the troops that moved into camp had less subsequent   sickness than those who remained in cantonments.    This is shown in Table No. V.    The  instances of injurious effects from removal that have come to my knowledge have arisen from  de- fective arrangements, irregular habits, exposure to the sun, too long marches, or the camp having been pitched in low marshy ground.    There is much  dis- comfort and considerable expense to the Officers and Government; but to the men in all the cases that have come under my observation it has been a  relief, and in some instances a source of much enjoyment.    The want  of dry ground in the vicinity of the station during the rainy season will soon be obviated by the extension  of railways.    The absence of fatigue and the facility of trans- port by rail strongly advocate its use, when available.    There is  no  point in the treatment of the disease on which the opinions expressed in the reports is more decided, or so unanimous.    Removal is considered one of the most efficacious  means available for   saving life during   cholera   epidemics.    The following are the practical measures best calculated to carry it into effect in India.    They are an extension of the valuable regulations laid down in the report of the Sanitary Commission in 1861. When epidemic cholera is prevailing in the neighbouring town or dis- trict, or if the station be in the line of the progressing wave, moro especially if cholera has prevailed at the same season in former years, special attention should be paid to the sanitary and dietary regulations in cantonments; and.
INDICATIONS OF TREATMENT.                                                                                                                    7                                                                  communication be restricted with the affected city or district. The appearance of a single case of cholera, or the unusual prevalence of diarrha, should be reported by the Regimental Surgeon to the Deputy Inspector General of Hospitals, who should at once examine the case, and if he considers it to be decidedly cholera, or merely suspicious, bring the subject to the notice of the Military Authorities. On the appearance of a second case within the week, or an increase of diarrha, the preliminary camp should be pitched, and carriage held in readiness to move all the troops m the station. The preliminary camp should consist of tents, with 8 cots each, for 15 per cent. of the European Troops at the station. It should not be more than a miles from the station, on raised ground, previously selected and carefully prepared, and if practicable across a river. It should be surrounded with a double row of trees, with trees planted on both sides of the streets of the camp, having a range of covered latrine trenches to the leeward, outside the outer line of trees. The ground on which the tents are pitched should be ploughed at the end of the season. The responsibility of recommending the removal of the troops, or delaying the removal till the appearance of the third or fourth case, will rest with the Deputy Inspector General, or the principal Medical Officer of the station; after the appearance of the fourth case the removal should be compulsory. The men should be moved progressively from each barrack as the disease appears in it, and they may return in a week after they have been free from the disease, if there has been no fresh case in the cantonment. The severity of most epidemics comes to a climax in about a fortnight, and. when the disease is subsiding, it may be worthy of consideration whether the men may not return to their barracks (after they have been thoroughly disin- fected) a few days earlier, when the intensity of the heat (as in the Punjab) is such as to induce fatal sunstroke. Should the premature return be followed by a revival of the disease the men should again be moved out; as this would clearly show that the locality was not yet free from the danger. The presence of the infected men is a source of danger to the rest of the station. The sooner they are removed the safer for the station, and the better for themselves. If the preliminary camp be ready the men should leave the infected barracks before sunset of the day on which the presence of the epidemic is declared. This detachment should march from the preliminary camp on the second day, to render it available for future use. Should cholera attack a Regiment on the line of the march, it should be separated into two or more parties, and keep making short marches every day, diverging slightly from the ordinary line of march, till the disease disappears MEDICAL TREATMENT. The course of the disease is generally divided into three stages, in each of which a distinct line of treatment is indicated, viz., Diarrha, Collapse, and Re- action. Previous to this there is generally a stage Malaise in which there is depression of spirits, with want of appetite and torpor of the bowels, which are induced by the presence of the poison in the system. The indications of treatment in the earlier stages are to assist nature by supporting the strength, counteracting the depressing action of the poison, promoting its elimination, and defending the parts through which it is dis- charged from the irritating action of the poison or vitiated contents of the bowels. The poison depresses or diminishes the action of all the organs by which nature purifies the blood. The first symptom of rallying from the most intenso attack is the discharge of the contents of the stomach and bowels, followed by the peculiar congee-like fluid ; this likewise forms the last sign of vital energy, when the symptoms progress from diarrha, which is the ordinary preliminary to collapse. In both instances this congee-like evacuation is a most exhausting process. As the poison is contained in these evacuations, it would appear theoreti- cally that purgative medicines were the best means indicated for assisting nature; but experience teaches that there are other and safer channels through which the poison may be eliminated, and that purgatives are most dangerous. Their action is very liable to be followed by congee stools and collapse, during 3

The ex- planations appear to be that the poison or the secretion caused by it is of an irritating nature to the mucous surface of the intestines, and that opiates soothe or lull the irritation during the period the poison is passing; whilst purgatives add to the irritation, and thus increase the power of the poison in producing collapse. It is therefore of vital importance to ward off this stage, even should the process detain the poison-a most dangerous inmate, but in a controllable state. One of the first points of treatment is therefore to soothe the irritation which causes the diarrha, and avoid or remove any extraneous matter which ordinarily induces irritation of the bowels. The next point is to promote the secretions of the eliminating organs, which have been diminished or suspended by the presence of the poison, viz., the liver, kidneys, skin, and lungs. In all these excretions the evidence is strong that the poison is contained, and it is apparently through them that the poison is quietly eliminated in mild cases, without exciting violent symptoms, The action on these organs of the remedies employed to check the diarrha must be borne in mind. Those medicines found by experience to diminish the secretions of the liver or kidneys should be avoided, The elimination theory has only a few advocates. They appear to consi- der purgation and elimination as synonymous terms, and recommend such remedies as increase the discharge from the bowels, as castor oil, rhubarb and tartar emetic. The result has not been such as to recommend its adoption by others who have had practical experience of the danger of exhibiting purgatives during cholera epidemics. The removal of irritating contents from the intes- tines, such as improper or undigested food, is essential, and is best done by a combination of castor oil and laudanum; but increased action of the intestines is not the only, or the safest method employed by nature to eliminate the poison This is clearly shown by the natural cure of the disease when no purgation ap- pears, as in the stage of malaise. There is no known antidote for the cholera poison, though there are few substances that have not been tried. Those which prevent fermentation or putrefaction have been strongly recommended; but hitherto tried without success. The depression of spirits naturally calls for the ordinary remedy, viz., brandy or wine which, in moderation, is not injurious ; but moderation is rare when panic is present. Excess should be guarded against with special care, and this will be aided by considering malaise as the first stage of the disease. The action of the poison is depressing on the nervous system and the indications of treatment are to support the strength by gentle stimulants and tonics, till the poison is changed by running its course, being digested, or simply passed off with other extraneous admixtures with the blood. The precautionary measures consist of carefully avoiding exhaustion and purgatives. The medi- cines required are anodynes or opiates, carminatives and tonics, especially quinine in the rainy season, wine in moderation and nourishing diet with little change from routine, TREATMENT IN SECOND STAGE :-DIARRHOEA OR CHOLERAIC DIARRHA, This is generally considered the first stage of cholera. It is marked by copious, light-coloured, painless purging ; the stools gradually become more watery, and at length colourless like rice or congee water. There is often un- easiness in the stomach, like heart burn, with occasional vomitting and cramps. The signs of malaise continue, the pulse is feeble, and the breath cold, the countenance dark and eyes congested. This stage lasts from a few hours to a week or ten days. The watery stools are sometimes preceded by billions vomitting and purging, with headache and febrile symptoms. The secretion of urine is scanty and wandering cramps are occasionally felt in the extremities. There is here in addition to the diminished action of the sympathetic nerves, the supervention of irritation of the mucous membrane of the intestines, with disturbance of the nervous system generally. The indications of cure are to remove or dilute any extraneous or specific irritant, to soothe the irritation of
TREATMENT IN SECOND STAGE OR DIARRHA.                                                  9 the mucous surface of the intestines, support the strength, and promote the secretions of the liver, kidneys, and skin. The nervous system, though en- feebled, is still sensible and amenable to the ordinary action of medicines. The variety of remedies recommended on theoretical and empirical grounds, in the various reports, is very considerable. Adds are strongly recommended by some. Several report favourably of diluted sulphuric acid, particularly in ordinary diarrha. There is no explan- ation of its modus operandi and many have tried it without benefit. Those who advocate its use combine it with opium, or spirits, and others alternate its exhibition with alkalies, as soda and ammonia. The alcoholic combination of hallier has been much used in the Bombay Presidency. Its use appears to be cooling and astringent, and less dangerous than some other more active remedies. Astringents, as catechu, kino, &c., are recommended by some; but if they retain irritating matter in the intestines they are injurious; and when this has been removed, they are not required. Antacids, as soda, and chalk mixture have often been employed without injury, and in many cases with advantage. The combination of Gregory's powder, with a little opium, is one of the best remedies for removing irritating matter from the intestines ; castor oil with a few drops of laudanum is equally valuable. Carminatives, as peppermint, spices, essential oils, and assaftida, are very agreeable to the feelings of the patient, and valuable in stimulating the sympathetic nerves and thereby promoting the restoration of the secretions, after the irritation of the bowels has been removed. Opiates are of the utmost value in this stage in checking inordinate action of the bowels, soothing irritation, and calming the system. Opium in various forms is the chief remedy. Its favourable action appears to be increased by combination with chloroform as in chlorodyne. The objections to its use are that it is apt to retain irritating matter in the bowels, and diminish or suppress the action of the liver and kidneys ; but by keeping these points in view, and counteracting them by calomel when necessary, opium is a most valuable remedy in this stage. There is danger of its being continued into the follow- ing stage, when it would be most injurious. This constitutes the chief difficulty in combining it with other medicines for general distribution over the country in cholera epidemics. Enemata.-This form of exhibiting remedies has occasionally been tried in this stage, when there was great irritability of stomach. Anodyne and hot saline enemata have proved beneficial. The form of administration is incon- venient, and not applicable for general use in extensive epidemics. Counter irritation.-Sinapisms or hot applications to the epigastrium are valuable, and when there is pain or irritability of the stomach, should not be neglected. Hot Water or Ain Baths, Wet sheets, Cold douche have been tried, and by some are highly recommended ; but, even if available, their employment is not generally to be advocated, and they are not essential in this stage. A watery infusion of Chillies, or Cayenne Pepper, has been very strongly recommended by some, as inducing re-action without being followed by danger- ous sequelae. It is more likely to be useful than many of the nostrums which have obtained ephemeral popularity, though the Surgeon who brought it to notice died from cholera. To guard against sudden changes of temperature, Flannel Belts are approved of both as precautionary and curative in affections of the bowels. In India they are also valuable in guarding the abdomen from intense heat. Belts are better suited for India than flannel shirts during the hot and rainy seasons. The symptoms in the earlier stages often subside after the use of many different, or even antagonistic, remedies. It is therefore very important, in determining the value of a remedy, to consider its influence in the subsequent stages; more particularly, as in wide-spread epidemics, the exhibition of remedies must be intrusted to people unaccustomed to professional work.
10                                              TREATMENT  IN  THIRD  STAGE  OR  COLLAPSE. It is the opinion of every one, professional and unprofessional, that  early treatment is of vital importance.    For this purpose it is essential that the medicine should be distributed all over the barracks, city,  or district in which the epidemic prevails.    It should be simple in form, not likely to deteriorate by keeping, nor to prove injurious if given needlessly, and requiring simple instructions as to its use.   It is of advantage that the remedy be easily procured, and that it should be in a dry form in India in consequence of caste prejudices. Numerous specific cholera medicines  have  been  vaunted.    They  are chiefly composed of  brandy with opium, chloroform, aromatic spices, and essential oils.    The looseness is often checked for a time by any of these remedies ; but when the disease proceeds to collapse, in cases where much opium or alcohol has been used, it generally terminates fatally.    The most common form used in. the Bengal Presidency is the cholera pill, composed of carminatives, spices, and opium.    What I have used since 1838, is composed of one part of opium, two parts of black pepper, and three of assaftida.    Its power in the earlier stages is decidedly great,  and no injury follows its needless exhibition.    In collapse it is powerless, and as it contains opium, its use is contra-indicated. In addition to these ingredients, red pepper, camphor,   soda or calomel are sometimes added.    The reports of the efficacy of these pills are highly satisfac- tory.    I believe no other remedy is more efficacious or less dangerous.   Cholera pills should be distributed in the barracks in phials, under charge of the N on- Commissioned Officers, to be  given to every man  who  applies,  or  who  is observed to visit the latrine more than once.    In the cities and villages in the country, they should be distributed in charge of the Police.    I have seen very satisfactory results from giving a pill with the grog,  on the evening of the removal of   troops from cantonments to cholera camps.    It secures a good night's sleep and calms anxiety, and I have seen its repetition the following night eagerly requested. TREATMENT  IN  THIRD  STAGE :-COLLAPSE. The symptoms are extreme prostration, livid countenance, cold clammy perspiration, feeble pulse, broken voice and oppressed breathing, burning pain in the epigastrium generally accompanied by evacuations of a watery or congee- like appearance (with a mawkish smell), and cramps of the extremities. There are some cases where human skill is powerless, and there is a similar advanced stage in all fatal cases ; but these are rarely met with without other stages having been passed through, in which the course of the disease might have been arrested, and this stage warded off. Even in the most hopeless cases, though life may not be preserved, much distress or agony may be alleviated! In less intense cases, many lives are saved by judicious treatment, where a fatal result would have followed neglect or improper treatment. When the poison has been removed from the body, or probably completed its course of development, re-action takes place. The burning pain subsides, the pulse returns, and the organs resume their ordinary functions. There are few instances in which nature succumbs before an effort at re-action has shown itself. It is at this critical period that exhausted nature again becomes sensible to the action of remedies, which a few minutes or hours before were inert. These are often accumulated in quantities which prove fatal by depressing, or over-exciting, the system. The congee-like discharges are evidently very exhaus- ting ; but they continue to remove the poison after the other less exhausting processes have ceased. They are of an acrid or  irritating character to the mucous membranes, and are rejected with violence by the stomach and bowels Their discharge gives relief, though followed by exhaustion, and their sudden cessation is alarming. The indications of treatment in collapse are- 1st.-To relieve prominent symptoms, and restore warmth. 2nd.-To support the strength and avoid exhaustion. 1st.- To relieve prominent symptoms. Thirst-Burning thirst is the most frequent and distressing symptom. It arises from the presence in the stomach of the poison, or the secretions induced by it. The constant calls of the patients for water indicate the natural course of treatment, There is no remedy
TREATMENT IN THIRD STAGE OR COLLAPSE.                                               11 more efficacious than cold or iced water, or soda-water. It palliates the agonizing burning thirst, and should be given in small quantities, frequently repeated, vis., from an ounce to two ounces every 10 or 15 minutes. It is generally vomitted after the third or fourth dose ; but it is brought up easily, and the exertion frequently strengthens the pulse, and brightens the countenance. This vomitting is certainly less distressing and exhausting than dry retching ; and some of the poison is probably eliminated in the fluid discharged. Vomitting of a congee-like., mawkish fluid is one of the most constant symptoms of this stage. It is concomitant with the burning pain in the epigastrium, and probably depends on the irritating contents of the stomach. In some cases the dry retching would appear to indicate irritation or inflam- mation of the stomach, and in other instances reflux of bile. The most useful treatment is the same as that required for thirst, viz., cold water or a small piece of ice placed in the mouth. Sinapisms to the epigastrium are valuables chloroform gives temporary relief, opium does no good, and alcohol often aggravates it. Hydrocyanic acid and chloroform act rapidly, and often succeed in allaying the vomitting and cramps, but only for a short time. These remedies lead to danger when re-action takes place. Ice to the spine is spoken of favorably by a few, and no injurious effects have been attributed to it. Cramps of the voluntary muscles are very constant and distressing. They appear to be connected with the irritation of the mucous membrane of the bowels, appearing on the side of the body where there are griping pains in the abdomen. The universal remedy for this symptom is friction, or champooing  of the parts affected, with the occasional addition of oil, turpentine, opium or chloroform, or rubbing with dry mustard and pepper. Chloroform by inhala- tion is strongly recommended ; the immediate effects are pleasing, but the relief is temporary, and the after effects uncertain, if not suspicious. Hot saline enemata remove the cramps in a large proportion of cases; and in some instances, the most marked benefit has followed their use, not only in checking the cramps, but also in restoring the pulse and colour, in relieving the other symptoms, and in being followed by mild re-action. The chief objection to them arises from the trouble and inconvenience of their exhibition in extensive epidemics; besides, in many advanced cases they are powerless, and it is dis- heartening to toil in vain. Cramps often cease long before death, and they are often absent entirely in the worst cases. Extreme depression with feeble action of the heart shows defective nervous energy. Some of the symptoms may be removed without the fatal course of the disease being materially delayed. The pulse which was imper- ceptible at the wrist may be restored, and a florid colour return to the livid countenance, and plumpness to the shrivelled fingers, by the transfusion into the veins of a saline fluid; but the voice remains broken, the secretions of the liver and kidneys are not restored, and death ensues in a few hours. A similar temporary re-action sometimes follows sub-cutaneous injection of quassia and chlorate of potash, and the use of the cold douche. There are several advo- cates of the sub-cutaneous exhibition of opium, chloroform, &c. ; but as these remedies cannot be retained on the stomach, there is danger of the punctures being followed by sloughing sores, should re-action take place. It is sad to desert so hopeful a line of treatment; but the most ardent advocates at last lose heart from the transitory influence of these measures. The cold livid skin arises from the suspension of the natural vital combus- tion of the carbon in the lungs. Artificial heat gives relief to the local pains, stimulates the heart, and assists re-action. It is a powerful auxiliary. Although it does not remove the impurities from the blood, it stimulates the voluntary nervous system, promotes the circulation on the surface of the body, and relieves the internal organs. It is universally recommended in the reports. It is ap- plied by hot bricks or bottles, or by means of hot air passed under the blankets. Hot baths are also recommended by some; but they are objectionable in consequence of the fatigue incurred in using them. The general application of heat does not imply that the local application of cold would be injurious. Experience proves that it is most agreeable and beneficial. Powerful remedies are recommended which are applicable to similar symp- toms in other diseases; but in the collapse of cholera they are powerless, 4
12                                                         TREATMENT IN THIRD STAGE OR COLLAPSE. though given in quantities that would prove injurious in health. Whilst they are inert they may be accumulated in the system to a fatal extent, as they resume their ordinary power on re-action. Opium is universally and justly condemned in this stage, as having little power, and as leading to coma and the suppression of the secretions of the liver and kidneys, on re-action taking place. Alcohol, in the various forms of brandy, wines, or beer, is the ordinary stimulant for exhaustion or depression. Many consider it to be essential, and some think it useful in proportion to the quantity given. Many think it neces- sary in small, but dangerous in large quantities. Others again of great experi- ence doubt its aiding re-action, and think it may even prevent its coming on ; and consider that when re-action does take place, where stimulants have been freely used, it is generally followed by dangerous sequel, such as fever and delirium. Any remedies likely to induce this state, more especially if they have no decided influence in removing collapse, should be avoided. In small quantities, combined with soups or arrowroot, they appear useful; but in large quantities they materially diminish the hope of recovery at the critical moment of re-action, when life is flickering, and when the wavering balance may be turned by influences which may be unconsidered or overlooked in this anoma- lous disease. Brandy in large quantities aggravates the vomitting; yet it is sometimes recklessly continued even though the patient complains of its doing no good A very small quantity in effervescing draughts is often given with relief, and is not likely to be injurious as it is soon vomitted, but it should not be given if retained. Champagne when, iced, is often given with relief to the thirst and vomitting, and sometimes it is retained when other medicines are rejected. This is a very agreeable form, but iced soda water or effervescing draughts are safer, less ex- pensive, and not less efficacious. The use of Stimulants has much increased of late years, and so has the rate of mortality. In former years life was considered safe when re-action appeared, but now a large proportion sink after re-action. This is most marked amongst the European troops. The great expenditure of spirits and wines, and the high rate of mortality during the epidemic of 1867, is shown in Table No. V. The quantity issued in excess of the maximum allowance may be fairly set down as expended 011 the cholera cases. There were (including men, women and children) 557 cases, and the expenditure above the maximum was 1,954 bottles. This would give an average expenditure of three and a half bottles to each case; but the expenditure varied in practice from no excess, to seven and a half bottles. The mortality in the latter instance amounted to 92.913 per cent. out of 127 cases. In this instance, the disease was very intense, but there was no advantage gained by the excessive use of spirits. This practice is condemned by the most experienced medical authorities. Though it be objectionable to interfere with the private judgment of executive officers, yet this excessive use of stimulants should be controlled by the administrative authorities. Chloroform is one of the most prominent of the remedies recommended as valuable in collapse. It is sometimes given in effervescing draughts, or in combination with opium in the form of chlorodyne, or as a local application externally; but the best form appears to be by inhalation. It relieves the cramps and vomitting for a time, and in some cases appears to induce re-action, with a return of pulse and colour, but without the appearance of bile or urine. These cases are often followed by excessive re-action and fever, with fatal deter- mination to the head. It has been recommended to combine other remedies with the chloroform used for inhalation, but the vehicle is dangerous. Sulphuric Acid has been extensively used, and it is strongly recommended by some as being very agreeable to take, and, when combined with opium, useful in restraining the vomitting and purging. Those cases in which it is used to the exclusion of spirits show a more favorable return than when the latter are freely used. A combination with alcohol in Hallier's mixture, and with aromatic spices has been used extensively in the Bombay Presidency, without apparent bad effects. It sometimes aggravates the burning pain in the
TREATMENT IN THIRD STAGE OR COLLAPSE.                                 13 stomach; but it is generally a cooling and innocent remedy, without any special, influence on the poison of cholera. Castor Oil, or medicines to increase the action of the bowels, are strongly recommended by some, on the theory of eliminating the poison through the bowels ; but the use of purgatives is acknowledged by all of experience in India to be most dangerous during the prevalence of cholera. The ordinary laxatives are combined with carminatives or opiates, otherwise they are often followed by congee-stools and collapse. The bowels form one channel for elimination, but the purging is most exhausting and dangerous, as it is apt to lead to collapse, when the system is little under our control. A prudent man. will avoid such danger, though it does not follow that benefit would arise from shutting up the evacuation by plugging the rectum, as has been recommended. In many instances, irritating matter, such as indigested food, must be removed from the stomach and bowels. Mustard appears to be the safest emetic, and castor oil or rhubarb the safest laxative; but these must be cautiously used, and the action of the bowels checked when the irritating matter has been evacuated. Bleeding was an old remedy, and it is still occasionally tried amongst des- perate remedies, but not with results sufficiently satisfactory to encourage persistence in its use. It is generally very severely condemned. Calomel.-This old idol of the Indian Doctors has still a few advocates. In scruple doses it is said to be a sedative, and in small doses, frequently re- peated, to promote the action of the liver and kidneys. The action of calomel in this stage is not more active than that of diffusible stimuli, which are inert. After re-action, it is not generally required, and it is injurious if mercurial action supervene. It is safer than violent remedies in the hands of those who think strong medicines required, but less powerful to alleviate dis- tressing symptoms than other and safer remedies, and it is generally inert. Belladonna has a few zealous advocates, but it has not been found useful by many who have tried it. It is not recommended. Acetate of Lead combined with opium or dissolved with excess of acetic acid is much relied on by some, and it is useful in many kinds of diarrha in diminishing the frequency of the evacuations. It has occasionally a similar effect in cholera; but that this is beneficial is questionable when the poison is passing off painlessly, and while the evacuations are not very profuse, Carbolic Acid is generally considered as worthy of trial. It is doubtless a powerful antiseptic and restrainer of fermentation or the development of the yeast fungi; but it has not been proved valuable in arresting the progress of the cholera germ in its earlier stages, and it is questionable if this germ be a fungus subject to similar laws of vitality. The same remark applies to the sulphites, sulphur, carbon, chlorine and many other remedies that have been recommended on theoretical grounds. They have been tried, and they do not stop the disease. Quinine is one of the most valuable remedies, especially during the rainy season, in India. Not that it is supposed to have any specific action on the Cholera poison, but it is employed as a prophylactic, or general tonic, in strengthening the action of the enfeebled organs, and warding off diseases which would render the body more open to the action of the cholera poison. It counteracts the influence of the miasma which prevails at that season in all tropical climates and predisposes to the attack. It should be used in small doses of about two grains daily, alternated or combined with chiretta, or some other bitter tonic. It should be given three times a day during the stage of malaise. In collapse, it is most beneficial when given two or three hours before the period of exacerbation, dissolved with a few drops of sulphuric acid in the small quantities of cold water given to allay the thirst. The hour of exacerbation, as a general rule, is about three o'clock; but a crisis twelve hours after the attack should be guarded against by precautionary doses of quinine. It has no apparent action and is powerless in many cases; but when re-action follows this mode of treatment, it is mild, and the restoration, of the secretions occurs early. In my experience, it has favorably turned the wavering scale in many critical cases. Some of the surgeons combine strychnine with the quinine, and some give the strychnine alone, with much.
41                                           TREATMENT IX FOURTH STAGE OR RE-ACTION. confidence, and  apparently  with  some  advantage.    But  care  must be taken that this most potent medicine does not accumulate in the stomach. Quassia and Chlorate of Potash have been lauded as inducing re-action when employed by subcutaneous transfusion, and chlorate of potash has been often used internally, but permanent good has too rarely followed these remedies to encourage their being generally used. Diffusible Stimulants are much used, and occasionally with some benefit, such as ammonia, camphor, peppermint, cajuputi oil, &c. Cold Affusion or Cold Douche employed during this stage is highly praised by some as restoring the action of the heart, which, they say, may be kept up by brandy. The great necessity for maintaining a recumbent position, and the danger from fatigue or exhaustion, must be borne in mind in the use of all remedies. I have met with several cases, and many more have been reported, in which simply getting up to stool, or rising in the bed, has been followed by fainting from which the patient never rallied. It is probable that the extensive coagula formed in the heart in many fatal cases may have formed during these fainting fits. It is possible that such coagula are occasionally the cause of subsequent secondary symptoms. To support the strength during collapse is of the greatest importance. Little reliance can be placed on the assimilation of food through digestion, as this process is in abeyance, as well as the other functions of the ganglionic system. Still it is important that the watery parts of the blood, which are expended in the profuse perspiration and congee-stools, should be replenished. The cold, acid, watery extract of meat recommended by Liebig appears to be more efficacious than any other form, particularly in cases of protracted col- lapse. Many apparently hopeless cases have rallied favourably under its use. Liquid food in the shape of arrowroot or soups well spiced and salted are most generally recommended. In these cases absorption without previous digestion takes place. Small quantities of brandy or wine are often added with apparent advantage ; but in the cases which rally without this addition, convalescence is more satisfactory. Some speak highly of milk, and some Native baids have great faith in "ghee" (melted butter) or sweet oil, which they give to the extent of six or eight pounds. Solid food should not be given. It is not digested, and if retained, it decomposes and does mischief. Little suspecting that the means employed extinguishes the last hope of the patient's recovery, it has been in these protracted and apparently hopeless eases, that the fatal practice of increasing the quantity of brandy and wine, and the use of violent remedies, has been resorted to, in the anxious desire of rescuing a hopeless case by desperate means. TREATMENT IN THE FOURTH STAGE:-RE-ACTION. Re-action is a natural stage in the course of the disease. The restlessness subsides, the burning thirst disappears, the pulse with warmth returns, the congee evacuations subside and become colored, bile appears in the stools, the urine flows, and sleep ensues and nothing but debility remains, which rapidly disappears. The functions of the involuntary system of nerves return, in manner similar to those of the voluntary system after insensibility induced by suffoca- tion from drowning, or fire damp, or from intoxication from alcohol,  or from breathing chloroform. Where the suspension of action is short, there are no sequel; but where the suspension has been prolonged, it is followed by fever of a low type. This is frequently complicated in cholera by local derange- nients caused by the action of the poison, or the remedies employed, or by the partial retention of the poison in the system. The re-action which follows copious congee evacuations is generally free from dangerous sequel. As the poison is contained in these discharges, their suppression, before it is completely eliminated, will leave a residuum which will continue to act injuriously. But the congee discharges are most exhausting, and life may succumb before the poison can be removed by them; therefore, they must if possible be restrained,
TREATMENT IN FOURTH STAGE OR RE-ACTION.                                                  15 even at the risk of entailing future complications. They sometimes suddenly stop from the poison having passed off, without subsequent ill effects ; but if this stoppage has followed the use of remedies which have merely paralysed or shut up the channel through which they were passing, a similar favorable recovery cannot be expected, and sequel should be anticipated. The action of the latent remedies may be traced in the symptoms super- added to those found in ordinary re-action. A knowledge of the remedies employed in collapse will facilitate the diagnosis of the cause of those sequel which follow re-action. When re-action takes place early and is uncomplicated, no active treatment is required. Rest is essential and sleep necessary, with mild nourishing diet and a little wine, and careful nursing. When collapse has continued for many hours, on re-action the stools are dark or green, the urine clouded, and the skin hot and dry; with low fever in severe cases. Tonics, especially quinine in the rainy season, are here required, and change of air during convalescence is beneficial. Irritability of Stomach is one of the common sequel of severe attacks. It may be the effect of imperfect elimination of the poison, or the result of its action on the stomach, or a consequence of the remedies employed. The diagnosis on this point will indicate the nature of the treatment, either to restore the secretions and eliminate the poison, or to subdue the inflammation. Tonics and anodynes are required in the first case; and ipecacuanha and calomel with anodynes in the second. Counter-irritation is valuable. Where there is great irritability of stomach, nourishment is best supplied by means of enemata of soup or arrowroot. I have seen exhausted cases safely supported by this means alone for several days, where the smallest quantity of nourish- ment was immediately rejected by the stomach. The Diarrha is often very difficult to cure. It has sometimes the character of the preliminary diarrha, arising probably from the same cause and requir- ing similar treatment. In other cases it depends on an excessive discharge of vitiated bile, or on irritation of the mucous membrane of the intestines, caused by the previous presence of the cholera poison having denuded the villous surface of its outer covering or epithelium, or again it may arise from inflammation, induced, like the vomiting, by the remedies, and requires similar treatment. The most obstinate form is attended with light colored, frothy, and copious stools passed with little pain. These cases often arise from disease of the kidneys. It is easy to check the number of stools by astrin- gents or opiates; but this does not cure the disease. In fact, it frequently causes mischief, and is followed by fever or other dangerous complications. Calomel, ipecacuanha, and diuretics are more valuable. They are laxative in their action, and so far follow the line of cure indicated by nature. The appearance of the stools is sometimes improved by the use of turpentine, or the application of blisters. Change of air is generally required to complete the cure. Sea bathing and drinking mineral waters are often useful in restoring health. Suppression of Urine, followed by urmia, is one of the most dangerous sequel. This paralysis of the kidneys may arise from the imperfect elimi- nation of the poison, or from the torpor caused by the action of narcotics or alcohol exhibited in the previous stages. The history of the previous treatment will facilitate the diagnosis. Tonics and diuretics will prove useful in the first case; but in the latter, the prospect of success has been rendered almost hopeless by the previous treatment. The battle between disease and life was lost ere re-action was established. Many of the cases in which alcohol or chloroform are said to have produced relief, or in which the evacuations have been restrained by the use of opium or acetate of lead, are followed by these intractable sequel. A lingering hope of success is sometimes reward- ed by a favorable result from the cautious use of blisters, or from dry cupping to the loins; or from the employment of calomel, chlorate or nitrate of potash, nitric ther, digitalis, and diluents, aided by nature, hope, good spirits, and a strong constitution. There is here full scope for the employ- ment of all the resources of medical science, and though they may be used in vain in some instances, yet the general safety of the sick rests on the intelli- gence with which they are used. Uraemia is rarely met with in natives, and with them alcohol is not freely used. 5
16                                                TREATMENT IN FOURTH STAGE OR RE-ACTION. Mild nourishing food is necessary. It should be easy of digestion, and given in small quantities, at short intervals, with a little wine. Careful nursing is of vital importance in severe cases, more especially at the commencement of re-action, when the strength must be husbanded with extreme care ; since merely assuming the erect posture, has, in many instances, been followed by instant death. The employment of convalescents who have recovered from the attack, as attendants on the sick, has been proposed under the idea that one attack affords immunity from subsequent attacks. This is a mistake, as is shown in Table No. VI. It would therefore be wrong to detain convalescents in hospital longer than is absolutely necessary for their recovery. In India, where efficient native substitutes can be obtained as champooers, the practice of allowing or requiring their comrades to attend on the sick is highly objectionable. These men are, as the rule, changed every six hours. The number attacked within two days of being on duty in the hospital is considerable; and the men sometimes have an exaggerated view of the danger of the duty. It is a needless exposure of the individual, in addition to the danger incurred of carrying the disease into barracks. The practice should be discontinued in all situations where substitutes can be procured. Those in at- tendance in cholera hospitals should be distinct from the regular hospital servants. There should be a separate convalescent ward, or tent, as it is very depressing for convalescents to see their comrades dying in agony by their side, and removal diminishes the danger of relapse. Appendix No. II is a mosaic of opinions and facts grouped symmetrically. It is culled from reports of shrewd practical men, which have been collected during the present and a previous investigation at Simla in 1867. The points selected for illustration are those on which practical experience bears strongest, and regarding which there is most obscurity or diversity of opinion in Europe and India. It would have needlessly lengthened the report to have illustrated the other important points on which the opinions expressed in the body of the report are nearly unanimous. These are shown in Table VII, which is an abstract of the replies from upwards of 500 Medical Officers of the British and Indian Medical Services, who have had personal experience in treating the disease. The general opinion is nearly unanimous on the sanitary and precau- tionary measures, and there is a very general concurrence in the indications of treatment, and regarding many of the individual remedies. The divergence increases as old practice and recent theoretical remedies pass through this prac- tical ordeal. Bleeding is repudiated, and faith in calomel gone. Opium is condemned, and so is the excessive use of alcohol. Acetate of lead is regarded with suspicion, and sulphuric acid with little confidence; and the danger from purgatives is acknowledged. There are a few apathetic or hopeless despondents; there are some who lag in the rear and will not be convinced; and a few strongly advocate individual remedies which do not prove successful in other hands. The general impression is, that much good may be done in limiting the ravages of the disease, both in extent and intensity, and many lives saved by recognising and treating the disease in its earlier stages, and much distress relieved, even when life cannot be saved. I have carefully examined these and other sources of information with the aid of thirty-six years of practical ex- perience, and I trust that the conclusions that have been arrived at will prove useful in saving life, and in imparting confidence till more certain information of the nature of the disease be discovered.

(    31    ) APPENDIX No. I. QUERIES ON THE TREATMENT OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA. I.-SANITARY MEASURES. Indications.-To remove impurities of air and water.-Obviate crowding. 1.    The influence of pure air and free ventilation, and of elevation of residence. 2.    The effect of malarious or vitiated air. 3.    The effects of crowding in buildings, and of assembling in large numbers at fairs, &c. 4.    The influence of pure water; of the soil in which wells  are  dug;   of the construction of wells;  and of boiling of water. 5.    The effects of admixture in water of natural salts, or of vegetable or animal adulteration. 6.    The effects of admixture of evacuations from affected individuals, from sewers, &c. 7.    The influence of latrines on the spread of the disease. 8.    The influence of trees in checking the dissemination of cholera. II.-PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES. 1.    Indications.-To preserve health, to avoid exhaustion, to guard against the dissemination of the disease, and the imbibing of the poison. 2.    Diet-Moderate use of wholesome food and wine. 3.    Avoiding unripe fruit, indigestible or tainted food. 4.    To remedy any disease, especially diarrha, and avoid exhaustion and exposure. 5.    The action of purgatives, especially saline, is dangerous. 6.    As to the use of quinine, particularly during the rainy season, and in malarious situations 7.    To prevent the dissemination of the disease through the evacuations of those affected. 8.    To remove, and bury, or burn evacuations. 9.    To disinfect utensils and contaminated buildings, and burn soiled clothing. 10.    To isolate the affected-Special attendants-Cholera hospitals should be moveable. 11.    Removal from the affected locality. 12.    To exclude affected individuals, or fomites. 13.     Disinfectants.-Special advantage of sulphur, chlorine, carbolic acid, iron, charcoal. 14.    House to house visitation, and distribution of medicine.    Early treatment. 15.     Discourage funeral or marriage feasts. III.-THE TREATMENT. 1.     General indications.-To remove the poison of cholera from the body. 2.    To strengthen or support the individual organs affected by the poison. 3.    To restore the secretions suspended by the presence of the poison in the body, as the liver, kidneys, lungs. 4.    To remove the effete constituents of the body retained by the suspension of the secretions and excretions. 5.    To support the strength. 6.    To guard against violent re-action. 7.    To remove local complications. 8.    The different stages of the disease requiring different remedies. 9.    The primary action of the poison depresses or paralyses the   sympathetic  and  ganglionic nerves, and diminishes or suppresses the secretions of the organs supplied by them. IV.-FIRST STAGE, OR MALAISE. 1.    Indications.-To eliminate the poison through the  secretions of the liver, kidneys and skin.-To avoid exhaustion or exposure. 9

Exposure to the sun or rain, and to great changes of temperature is dangerous. 3.    Warm clothing, especially a flannel belt, is useful. 4.    Remedies-There is no known antidote or specific remedy. 5.    Spices and carminatives are useful, 6.    Wine and spirits are useful to those habiuated to their use. 7.    Calomel is valuable when the stools are light-coloured. 8.    Quinine and bitter tonics are useful, especially in the rainy season. 9.    Purgatives, especially saline, are dangerous, and are apt to induce congee stools and collapse. 10.    Change of air useful.    Long marches or fatigue to be avoided. V.-SECOND STAGE, DIARRHA-CHOLERAIC DIARRHA. 1.    Indications-To check the looseness, remove irritating ingesta, soothe irritation, and pro- mote the secretions. 2.    Remedies-Opiates remove pain and check looseness,  but retain  irritating  ingesta and diminish the action of the liver. 3.    Chlorodyne is more energetic than opium with analogous action on the secretions-it sti- mulates the brain. 4.    Brandy and wine remove depression of spirits, but do not check looseness, and the re-action is dangerous. 5.    Spirits with opium check the looseness, but do not restore the secretions of liver, &c., and the re-action is dangerous. 6.    Astringents check the looseness, but retain the cause of the irritation, and do not restore the secretions. 7.    Spices and carminatives remove the depression and restore the secretions, but alone do not check the looseness or remove pain. 8.    The combination of carminatives and opiates removes the pain and checks the looseness without suspending the action of the liver or affecting the brain. 9.    Cholera pills are very valuable, and convenient in form; they are composed of assaftida and opium with black and red pepper, and sometimes camphor. 10.    Calomel is powerful, and valuable in restoring the secretions of the liver and kidneys when the looseness is checked, given in one large or repeated small doses. 11.    Sulphuric acid in some cases appears to act beneficially; vinegar and acid drinks are useful. 12.    Acetate of lead with opium checks the looseness and retains ingesta;   it does not restore the action of the liver. 13.    Sinapisms to the epigastrium are valuable, especially when vomiting appears. 14.    Enemata-Hot saline, are sometimes most beneficial, but occasionally powerless. 15.    Bleeding is not generally followed by benefit, and sometimes by collapse. 16.    Warm baths and wet sheets are sometimes useful, and not likely to be injurious.    Cold affusion is sometimes useful. 17.    Purgatives and antimonial medicines are apt to induce congee stools and collapse. 18.    Over fatigue, exhaustion mental or bodily, and depression or fear, lead to congee stools and collapse. VI.-THIRD STAGE-COLLAPSE. 1.    Indications-To relieve urgent symptoms, supply warmth, and avoid strong remedies, and watch for re-action. 2.    Remedies-For burning thirst-Cold or iced water frequently  repeated, with occasional addition of ammonia and soda. 3.     Vomiting-Sinapisms or blisters to  the  epigastrium-hot turpentine fomentation-iced water.    Large  doses   of calomel; of  hydrocyanic  acid.    Vomiting  gives  relief and acts as a stimulant in the most intense forms of cholera. 4.     Congee stools-These give relief till re-action comes on and the colour of the evacuations changes; hot saline enemata are sometimes useful. 5.    Cramps-Frictions with turpentine  or dry ginger-hot  bottles-hot saline enemata- chloroform. 6.    Feeble action of heart-- Transfusion of saline fluid restores   the  action of the  heart  and colour ; but only for a short time.    Hot saline enemata are sometimes useful.    Alcohol is powerless as a stimulant during this stage and injurious in the following. 7.    Sinking or dead feeling in the epigastrium (paralysis of the sympathetic nerve?)-Infusion of chillies or red pepper, camphor, am monia, aromatic spices useful in   small quantities, brandy, chlorodyne, ther, have little action in collapse and are dangerous on  re-action.

Quinine in small closes before the hour of exacerbation is often useful in aiding re-action and warding off the recurrence of sinking. 9.    Belladonna, quassia, chlorate of potash, sulphuric acid, strychnine, acetate of lead and opium, hot water, air baths, and small bleedings are said by some to be useful.    Hy- podermic injections, tartar emetic, mustard emetics have been used. 10.    Opium is injurious, preventing re-action, and causing coma should re-action come on. 11.     Chloroform or chlorodyne gives temporary relief, but re-action is often followed by head symptoms or delirium. 12.    Brandy, alcohol, or wine do not restore the action of the heart, or assist re-action; and when re-action does take place, it is often violent and dangerous. 13.    Active or powerful remedies should not be used, as in this stage their action is in abeyance; this returns on re-action, and these remedies are often accumulated in the stomach. 14.    Carbolic acid, sulphite of soda, charcoal, have been recommended. 15.     To support the strength-Small quantities of soup, arrowroot or sago with a little brandy- Liebig's extract of raw meat is useful in very protracted cases. 16.     Fatigue must be avoided, especially getting up to stool or assuming the erect position, which is often followed by fatal syncope.    On a march, bad cases to be left in hospital. 17.    Supply warmth to the body by hot bottles, &c.; cold affusion is said to induce re-action. 18.     Support the spirits of the patients by the hope that the favourable re-action may soon come, and cheer them when the first symptoms appear. VII.-FOURTH STAGE-RE-ACTION. 1. This is a natural stage of the disease, taking place in all but extremely severe cases ; it is little accelerated by remedies, though the subsequent symptoms often are. The rest- lessness subsides, the burning thirst disappears, the pulse with warmth returns, and bile appears in the stools. At this period brandy and opium are powerful poisons. 2. The indications are now to induce sleep, relieve distressing symptoms, restore the secre- tions of the liver and kidneys, and support the strength. 3.     For sleep, rest and surrounding quiet-carefully avoid raising the body-iced water. 4.     Quinine in small doses is very valuable in restoring the secretions and preventing recur- rence of collapse, especially in the rainy season. 5.    After sleep the prominent symptoms must be relieved, and the secretions restored. 6.     Suppression of urine calls for immediate treatment by turpentine fomentations and blisters to the loins, nitrate of potash, ther, tincture of cantharides, chlorate of potash, dry cupping, hot baths. 7.    Deficiency of bile-Calomel and ipecacuanha, with opium if looseness continues. 8.    Purging-Anodynes, calomel and ipecacuanha, enemata. 9.    Vomiting-Effervescing draughts-counter irritation.    Nourishing enemata are valuable when food is vomited. 10.    Nourishing food at short intervals with a little wine. 11.    Change of air in convalescence. 12.    One attack does not prevent a recurrence during the same season or in subsequent epidemics. Note.-The object of the accompanying queries is to elicit the opinion of the medical profession in India with regard to the treatment of cholera. With a view to conciseness, the questions are generally put in a suggestive, rather than in a directly interrogative form, and the replies founded on the personal experience of the Medical Officer answering, are requested. In several instances, the value of the particular line of treatment is indicated, and the good or had effects of in- dividual remedies in the different stages of the disease are noted. On these points the result of extended personal experi- ence will be very valuable. Should there be any other remedies, or opinions of practical importance, which are not alluded to in these queries, on which Medical Officers are able to afford personal experience, they are requested to add them in the final remarks.
(   34   ) APPENDIX No. IL EXTRACTS FROM REPLIES BY MEDICAL OFFICERS TO QUERIES ON THE TREATMENT OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA. I.-SANITARY   MEASURES. Query No. 1.-The influence of pure air and free ventilation, and of elevation of residence. Arnott, F. S., Inspr. Genl., Bom. I.*-Previous to the outbreak of cholera at Kurrachee in June 1846, as detailed in the transactions of the Medical and Physical Society of Bombay for 1853, p. p. 180-181, the weather on the 14th June was in every respect similar to what it had been for several days till between 5 and 6 P. M. About that time and during Divine Service, a singular state of atmosphere was observed. The wind veered round from W. and S. W. to N. E., and although there was scarcely any breeze, it was raw, chilly and unpleasant, and a thick lurid cloud, apparently of dust, hung low and almost stagnant over the camp; some people observed, or fancied they observed, at the same time, an offensive suffocating putrid odour, and that a sudden nausea was produced. Bryden, J. L., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-The 32nd Regiment, on the march from Kussow- lie to Luckuow, left the former station on the 31st October 1856, and immediately afterwards contracted cholera between Kalka and Umballa, which it carried for 15 days. This cholera was a portion of the great invading epidemic geographically distributed during July and August 1856, revitalised at the end of October, but localised, as is generally the case with the cholera of this season in the North-West. This cholera lay dormant during the months from December 1856 to April 1857, and when, on the 13th May 1857, the Fusiliers and 75th Regi- ment descended from the hill stations, they marched at once into this very same cholera field which the experience of the 32nd showed to exist more than six months previous. Had any regiment marched over this ground in the interval, no harm would have ensued, for cholera has the power of affecting the human race only during those portions of the year for which it is vitalised. I consider that cholera is never diffused as an air-borne epidemic without the coincidence of a humid atmosphere. As regards the question of re-development, I believe it to occur, sooner or later, strictly in relation to the natural seasons of humidity of the province within which cholera is dormant. As in the case of malaria, I believe that excess of moisture in its breeding grounds prevents the reproduction of cholera. Furnell, M. C., Surgeon, Mad. I.-As to the influence of pure air and ventilation I am unable to offer any authoritative remarks. Elevation of residence would seem to be most inimical to the spread of cholera. This disease was imported into Ootacamund, Neilgherry Hills in October 1866 (vide Madras Quarterly Journal of Medical Science, No. XXI, January 1867), but it soon died out, only two persons seemingly being infected by the importers of the malady, who arrived in numbers from the low country. I am informed that this has several times occurred, and that cholera has been imported by people who have been to the low country to attend fairs or religious festivals, amongst whom, on returning, it has spread itself. "Madras Times" 10th August 1868.-THE "CANDIA" STEAMER.-It seems that as this vessel was coming down the Hooghly, she experienced a blast of a peculiarly hot wind blowing across the Sunderbunds, and the lascars (native seamen) at once declared that cholera would break out on board. Before many hours their prediction was verified, the third mate falling a victim within two hours of the seizure, and the chief officer almost as rapidly. Two European seamen also died of it. As soon, however, as the vessel had got well out to sea, the other persons who had been attacked rapidly mended, and were nearly convalescent on their arrival off Madras. Raddock, C. E., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-Whatever is the nature of malaria, I believe it to be the most fertile source of cholera in Bengal. At Dum-Dum, (a clamp climate) where the lines of the 1st Regiment Native Infantry are damp, and situated near swampy ground, and before the men became in a manner acclimatized, eases of cholera occurred every now and then, chiefly among weakly men. When intermittent fever, diarrha and dysentery were most prevalent, it was observed in a few cases, in a sufficiently marked manner, that fever, diarrha and dysentery cases got cholera, and that the other disease returned when the cholera was cured. Sutherland, J., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-The cholera poison, whatever may be its nature, has a remarkable affinity for impurities derived from the decomposition of animal or vegetable matter ; the features of the poison are such wherever they are to be found. It does not follow that these impurities are visible to the sight, or cognizable to the sense of smell; but that such exist and become potent means for the spread of the disease, I have no doubt, from facts that have come under my own observation. * NOTE.-Abbreviations:-Ben.

Appendix No. II. ]                            I.-SANITARY MEASURES.                                                             35 Query No. 3.-The effects of crowding in buildings, and assembling in large numbers at fairs, &c. Clarke, J. J., Surgeon, Ben. I.-In all severe visitations of epidemic cholera, one prominent feature is invariably present, namely, the excessive prevalence and severity of the disease among those who have been living in ill-ventilated crowded apartments, or massed together in large numbers, as at fairs and in large camps, where overcrowding in tents and other places of shelter, is frequently beyond all conception. Fnrnett, M. C., Surgeon, Mad, I.-As to whether impurities of air or water have anything to do with causing cholera, I wish to put on record the following singular circumstances. When I was Civil Surgeon of Cochin in 1864 and 1865, I was in medical charge of two jails, one in British Cochin, and the other at Gonacollum (Native Cochin) belonging to the Rajah. The places are widely separated, a large breakwater, some miles across, running between the two. The British jail was a singularly clean one, very well ventilated, and containing ample accommo- dation for 30 or 40 prisoners located there. The jail at Gonacollum, on the contrary, was a very dirty place, and had not been whitewashed for a long time ; the rooms were small, much too small for the number of prisoners put into them, and moreover the cholera was raging all round about, whilst in British Cochin there was none. I made some representations to the native authorities about having their jail cleaned, and whilst the correspondence was going on, the cholera made its appearance in my clean English jail (although, as I said before, there was no cholera in the town round about,) and simply decimated the prisoners, whilst the native dirty jail, with cholera raging all about it, escaped altogether. On this occasion, at the earn- est request of the Magistrate, who was in charge of the jail, I gave chlorodyne a full and fail- trial. Earl Russel's letters to the papers had just then been published and created a great feeling in favour of chlorodyne as a cure for cholera. I found no benefit whatever from its use. Kidd, ?. ?., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-In the end of February 1860, I was in charge of the ship Appleton, with a batch of 436 coolie emigrants, bound to the West Indies. Cholera appeared the morning after we left Calcutta. My report to the Governor of Trinidad ran thus : "PARA 2.-At the time we left Calcutta, cholera was raging not only in town but in the coolie depot, where the mortality was five or six per day. It is very injudicious to send a ship away with coolies when cholera is among them; from my long experience I knew what would be the result, namely, great mortality, especially due to the confined space of a ship, I looked forward to the chance of quickly getting out to sea, where, with a stiff breeze, the disease may be warded off. I was unfortunate, as cholera broke out on the same evening, and 17 fatal cases occurred. Whilst in the river, in five days I had 69 cases. When we got out to sea the breeze proved exceedingly light and the sun hot, and cholera continued. The type was formidable, in a few hours carrying off a patient, and those who rallied, died from coma." Whitton, G. E., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-My own personal experience leads me to believe that the use of brackish water contaminated with animal and vegetable impurities, excessive overcrowding, the immediate proximity of filthy latrines, the want of ventilation, and the constant presence of vile odours, are not in themselves necessarily sufficient to generate cholera, provided that the individuals exposed to these influences are well and suitably fed, and that their occupations are of such a nature as not to produce any great physical exhaustion. I would refer to the absence of cholera in the "Circar" jail at Gonacollum in the native state of Cochin as bearing out these remarks. For 28 years the prisoners in that jail have been subject to the above insanitary conditions, and yet not a single epidemic of cholera has broken out, although frequently epidemics have occurred in the immediate vicinity of the jail. A more detailed account of the extraordinary immunity from epidemic cholera on the part of the prisoners in this jail was given in the Administration Report of Cochin for the year 1865-66. It was shown in that report that no alteration was made in the food of the prisoners after admission, each being allowed to make use, in sufficient quantities, of such food as he was accustomed to, and the hard labour of the prisoners was shown to be moderate and not such as to tax the strength. The sanitary condition of the jail was shown to be bad in the extreme. My opinion is, that whatever part an insanitary state may play in the spread of epidemic cholera (and doubtless it is great), it has not the power in itself of generating the disease amongst a class of people who are properly fed, and who do not suffer from physical exhaustion. Query No. 4.-The influence of pure water and the soil in which wells are dug; the con- struction of wells ; the boiling of water. De Tatham, H., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-I knew of three cases occurring in the same house, in a mews, in London. I informed the Sanitary Officer and he inspected the house and reported that the soil pipe leading from a privy leaked and contaminated the contents of a butt from which the people of the house obtained their drinking water. No other cases occurred in that mews. Murray, T., Surgeon Major, Bom. I.-An instance of the advantage of filtering water was related to me by Mr. W. G. Pedder, c. s., Superintendent of the Khandeish Survey. When his camp was pitched at Chukla in Surat in the hot weather, and when cholera was raging, he found that the people got their drinking water from stagnant pools in the channel of the river, which was then dried up, and in which they washed their clothes. He at once had a number of 10
36                       REPLIES TO QUERIES ON THE TREATMENT OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.     [ Appendix Query No. 4,-continued. "kucha" wells or "jurah" dug in the sand, and made the people use the water thus obtained, and the disease from that time began to abate. It is believed in this province (Malligaum) that water from deep wells is less likely to occasion sickness than water from streams or "nullahs." Peterkin, J., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-The chlorides and carbonates in small quantities produce little really deleterious effects; sulphates may be more or less laxative ; the nitrates per se are no more injurious, but their presence indicates the existence of animal organic matters, which have a prejudicial effect encouraging to dysentery, typhoid, &c. Impregnation with vegetable matters is in this country supposed often to lead to intermittent and remittent fevers. In 1843 I was travelling through the "Kirwal Jungles" in the month of October, and arriving at my halting place one morning a considerable time before my servants, I was tempted to drink rather copiously of a beautiful limpid clear stream in the middle of the jungle. I had been watched by a native guard stationed a short distance below, and in the course of the day the native officer in command informed me that I should certainly get jungle fever, as no one used that water without doing so. I was so attacked about 12 days after, whether owing to that or the journey through the jungle I cannot tell; but I am inclined to think the draughts of that water were not the cause, for it was clear, limpid, cool, and void of smell, taste or colour. Thom, W., Deputy Inspector General, Bom. I.-When serving as Assistant Surgeon at the Warley depot some years ago, I had in two cases what to my mind showed most forcibly the analogy between typhus and cholera. These men were brought into hospital from the same barrack room, both having been as it were suddenly struck down by some powerful poison; they presented all the appearance of cholera in its worst form. There was no vomitting or purging, the poison having been too powerful for this. They both proved rapidly fatal, and it was only within a few minutes of death in the one case and about half an hour in the other, that the petechial spots appeared. These cases made a forcible impression on my mind, and I perfectly well recollect remarking at the time to the apothecary, that in India they would be yet down as cases of cholera, but occurring in England they are called typhus. Wilson, R., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-The influence of pure water I believe can hardly be overrated in the prevention of zymotic disease generally. Wells should be so constructed as to prevent all surface drainage from being mixed with the drinking water. The people of the district, however, prefer the river water, or that from channels which convey the river water to the rice fields, for drinking purposes, and this water is much polluted along its course before it reaches Tinnevelly or Palamcottah. The filthy clothes of all the villages along its course are washed in the river ; the people use the river and channel banks as a place of convenience every morning, and then they bathe and wash in the river ; a slight shower of rain washes all this bank filth into the river, and yet the people use this water in preference. For the last nine years, I have observed that a visitation of cholera occurs annually in this and the Madura district in the mouths of November and December, and breaks out immediately after the rains of the north-east monsoon; whether this depends upon people drinking impure water I can- not of course with certainty say, yet I believe so long as this custom of drinking defiled water prevails, the annual visitation of cholera will also continue to appear in this part of India. Query No. 7.-The influence of latrines on the spread of the disease. Brown, J. B. S., Surgeon, Ben. I.-From my own experience, I have never had reason to believe that cholera is communicable from the evacuations in consequence of any cholera poison they may contain. Believing, as I do, that cholera is caused by a poison in the air which acts primarily on the blood, I cannot understand how the poison of cholera can be in the eva- cuations. But granting that the cholera poison is in the discharges, is there any real evidence to prove that the disease is diffused by means of air and water? Suppose we take 20 ounces of a cholera evacuation (by this I mean genuine "congee water" evacuation, free from any bilious or fcal matter), and thoroughly evaporate it, what amount of solid residuum, which doubtless will contain the cholera poison if present, may we expect to obtain? And granting that this residuum contained the most virulent cholera poison, is it according to common sense to believe that a poison so disintegrated and so thoroughly divided and sub-divided into the smallest quantities by the action of the wind, &c., could have the slightest influence for evil, and could causo cholera to break out on a sudden amongst a population spread over a large expanse of country. Besides would not the cholera evacuations follow the rule of other animal matters (fluid and solid) when separated from the body, i. e., would they not putrefy, and would not the process of putrefaction thoroughly destroy any cholera poison they might contain. Again, if a poison was generated by the putrefactive process, would this poison be the poison of cholera? It is somewhere mentioned in "Copland's Practice of Medicine" I think, that during an outbreak of cholera in Warsaw, some medical men drank cholera vomit without experiencing the slightest bad effects; this proves that cholera poison is either not present in the matter ejected from the stomach, or if it is present, that it cannot be absorbed by mucous membrane. Kennedy, J., Deputy Inspector  General, Mad. I.-Increases the spread. All evacuations from cholera patients should be disinfected, removed, and buried.

McRae, D., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-I am clearly of opinion that cholera is not communicable in any of its stages, neither is it reproduced by evacuations. I look upon cholera as a disease of the nervous system, produced by a malaria arising in and from an unknown state of the atmosphere. Ross, J. T. C., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-In my opinion, unhealthy latrines will produce diarrha. In a cholera season such discharges, bearing the germ of the disease, will affect persons brought in contact with them, and predispose them to be affected. The history of all epidemics proves how the cholera discharges themselves affect those brought in contact with them, unless the most stringent sanitary measures be adopted. Stewart, L. W., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-Latrines, unless kept quite clean or unless dry- earth be used, render the air more vitiated, and consequently form nuclei for the generation of cholera, or at least intensify the poison of the surrounding air. Query No. 8.-The influence of trees in checking the dissemination of Cholera. Banister, G., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-It seems reasonable to believe that trees act on the cholera germ as they do on marsh poisons, not only by entangling the matter, but also perhaps by some oxidizing power connected with the generation of ozone. I think it was in the rainy season of 1852 that the late "Kumaon Battalion" suffered at Deyrah from severe epidemic cholera. Rain was so heavy and incessant, that it was impossible to move the regiment far away, and so I recommended that they should be encamped on the parade ground, certainly not more than 150 yards from their lines; seizures took place during the three following days, but after that not a single case occurred. There is an umbrageous belt of magnificent trees (Ficus Indica and Religiosa,) separating the lines from the parade ground. Bateson, R. S., Surgeon, Sen. I.-No experience. But I am disinclined to believe in such an influence; trees help to spread people, as they occupy ground and space. Village popula- tion go to tree shelter when they leave their homes when cholera-stricken. Beatson, J. F., Offg. Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-Of this fact, I apprehend, there is a general belief, and very strong evidence of their value was not long ago adduced by the Deputy Commissioner of Chutteesgurh, in the Central Provinces. In the very widely diffused epidemic of cholera at Allahabad in 1859, those portions of the force whose barracks had the benefit of trees hard by, had undoubted exemption, and just in proportion to the closeness and nearness of the screen. Thus the European Cavalry in the Wellington Barracks, situated between four rows of stately mangoe trees, yet still in some measure open, suffered far less than the 4th Europeans, whose quarters were on a hill upon which the winds spent their full force ; while the Bengal Horse Artillery, located in a tope of mangoe trees, had not a single case of the disease ; nor could this exemption be viewed as accidental, since in the following year the comparative immunity was precisely the same. Carter, H. V., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-Strong opinions have been expressed, that trees check the spread of cholera; and the physiology of vegetation is not unfavourable to this view. Chalmers, C. B., Deputy Inspector General of Hospitals, Ben. I.-The influence of trees in purifying the air is undoubted, and hence it assists in checking the spread of cholera. Daly, G, IL, Surgeon, Ben. I.-I am not aware of any instance in which trees have had any influence in checking the dissemination of cholera, but as a general sanitary measure, the planting of trees is highly to be recommended. Duckworth, F., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-Experience points to the fact that trees and forests oppose a barrier to the dissemination of cholera, to a greater or less extent. This they may do mechanically, and also because their natural processes of absorption, nutrition and secretion are perpetually going on and effecting salutary changes in the air. Farquhar, T., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-From the records of the Central Provinces, their good effect seems unquestionable. Gane, H. J., Surgeon, Bom. I.-A belt of trees has been known to stay disease. Griffith, H., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-The presence of trees acts beneficially, and I think some classes of trees act more beneficially than others. A village of the name of Bhudoogaum in this district, has (it is said) never been visited by cholera. It is surrounded by "neem trees." Some months ago, I asked Captain Doveton, Conservator of Forests, to give me a description of the place. It is as follows :-In 1865, when cholera was raging in the Hoshungabad district, I visited the town of Bhudoogaum, when, to my surprise, I found there had not been a single case, notwithstanding that numbers of people were dying from it in the surrounding villages. From all I could ascertain from the inhabitants, this town had never been visited by cholera. The village of Bhudoogaum is situated on a high bank on the Sungul River, and on the east and west sides there are belts of jungle running north and south ; but the general level of these is below that of the village, and in this respect, all the surrounding villages are equally well situated. One remarkable feature connected with the vegetation exists, viz., the immense number of neem trees that surround the place, and to
38                      REPLIES TO QUERIES ON THE TREATMENT OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.      [ Appendix Query No. 8,-continued. this my attention was drawn as soon as I arrived. From the observations I have been able to make during the past nine years, I have come to the conclusion that cholera is less likely to visit a jungle village than one without any trees about it, but in cases where it breaks out in jungle villages, the effects are considerably worse, inasmuch as a larger proportion of the people take the disease. Guise, J. A., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-This year a wing of the 77th Regiment was again sent into camp in consequence of the occurrence of some cases of cholera on the 17th September. The rains had ceased. Ground, with a good watershed, in an extensive tope of mangoe trees, was obtained. The men were in the open air under the shelter of the trees all day long, and the effect, not only in checking all symptoms of cholera, but on the health and spirits of the men, was most satisfactory. Kendall, H., Surgeon Major, Ben. B.-Most effective. The places where I have seen the disease most fatal have been open, or comparatively open, plains. Lowe, T., Surgeon, Mad. I.-Trees having great powers of absorbing mephitic exhalations tend to check the progress of air laden with choleraic exhalations, or with those other elements which tend primarily to induce the disease. MacLeod, A. C., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-As fever malaria is clearly capable of being transported by winds, it is quite conceivable that it may be intercepted by trees, and the notion is also strongly countenanced by authentic facts. But I imagine cholera to be of tellural (probably mineral) origin, and that the earth itself is a chief medium of conducting such a disease. Whatever the hypothesis may be worth, one thing is certain, that cholera poison will travel contrary to, and in the teeth of, the strongest trade winds; and such a property seems to me incompatible with the supposition that trees will intercept it. That trees, however, do act most beneficially in freeing the air of impurities I am persuaded, and for that reason alone would counsel their culture and preservation. Macpherson, H. M., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-A thick belt of trees may prevent the epidemic spreading to the locality immediately beyond. Mee, J., Surgeon Major, Bom. B.-A belt of trees might check the progress of an epidemic, Miles, H. C., Surgeon, Bom. B.-The influence of trees in checking dissemination is, it is thought, undoubted. Miller, A. H., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-Favorable as tending to the oxygenation of the poison. Munro, W., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. B.-Trees are most influential in protecting from all malarious exhalations. I here give extracts from my cholera report of 1862 :-"As long" "as the regiment (93rd Highlanders) remained in Peshawur, the officers, shut up in their well- "wooded compounds, escaped entirely (from both cholera and diarrha), but almost imme- "diately after going into camp, five officers (all within a few hours of each other) were seized "with cholera ; again, on the 28th October, previous to which we were suffering severely, the "regiment moved ground to a wooded plateau about three miles distant, but rather higher "than our last camp, and there our feelings of relief from choleraic sensations were remarkable. "Whether from the excitement of the move, or the protection of the trees, I know not, but "certainly both did good in as far as both afforded us pleasure." For four days we had no more cases of cholera, and the few cases that occurred after that, were mild. From the day we moved to this wooded ground, the disease began to subside. O'Brien, T. M., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. B.-A site under trees sometimes checks cholera, but brushwood is to be avoided. O'Leary, T. C., Surgeon Major, Mad. B.-Trees are useful as the leaves act as mechanical obstacles to currents of air impregnated with deleterious particles; an excessive growth of timber is, however, likely to interfere with perflation. Perkins, R. H, Surgeon, Ben. I.-In Lower Bengal, the disease seems quite isolated in certain houses, or groups of houses, surrounded by bamboo and other jungle. Reade, W., Surgeon, Mad. B.-Trees have a great influence in checking the spread of cholera. Advantage should always be taken of belts of trees, with the view of arresting the progress of the disease.                                                                                                                 Rennick, R. H., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. I.-I have had no opportunities of forming un opinion in regard to the influence of trees in checking the dissemination of cholera; but I have a perfect recollection that, when marching with regiments suffering from the disease, it appeared to become more virulent on entering jungles, and to abate in severity when a more open country was reached. Simpson, D., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-Trees and rivers are said to check the disease, In many epidemics, they, in no way, modify the progress of cholera. Trees in a cholera camp are injurious by obstructing currents of wind. The ground near trees is often dirty. Smith, C. M., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Beneficial in preventing the spread of the virus.

Genl. of Hospitals, Ben. B.-The trees at Peshawur have apparently protected the compounds of the officers to a considerable extent. Only one officer was attacked at the close of the epidemic at this station, when resident in cantonment. Bar- rack yards have no trees nor shade at Peshawur. The men having suffered severely from cholera epidemics on two occasions. Thom, W., Deputy Inspr. Genl. of Hospitals, Bom. I.-They are useful for this purpose. Turton, F. A., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. B.-Large umbrageous trees are good in checking dissemination in cholera. Williams, H. F., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Trees are considered desirable, the disease being occa- sionally partially or wholly checked by belts of trees. Williams, W., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-I cannot, from experience, adduce any instance in which trees have had any influence in checking the spread of cholera; but instances have been known, where trees have been cut down, of cholera making its appearance, where, before this, the locality had enjoyed immunity from it. Wright, A., Deputy Inspr. Genl., Bom. I.-I consider that large tracts of trees will check the cholera waves. II.-PRECAUTIONARY   MEASURES. Query No. 1.-Indications-To preserve health, to avoid exhaustion, to guard against the dissemination of the disease, and the imbibing of the poison. Clementson, F. L., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-Most true. I have found it so in my own experience. Gardner, E. B., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-There was a good deal of diarrha, the effects of errors of diet. A great deal occurred during September 1867. And it is remark- able, as connected with the recent theory with regard to the origin of cholera, that "mukka," a very coarse, cheap rice, was being much used as bread. The natives themselves attribute to it, when first cut, deleterious properties, and it undoubtedly often produces symptoms similar to that of cholera. Kennedy, J., Deputy Inspr. Genl., Mad. I.-In my experience most dangerous. Maclean, A., Surgeon, Bom. B.-Like other epidemic ailments, cholera has, I believe, its own special course, and if this disease can be excluded, the disease can be prevented. The- treatment of this fearful disease is undoubtedly unsatisfactory, but our attempts at prevention, if prompt and rational, need not be so, I think. Penny, J. C., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-In my opinion, much more of importance lies in this direction than in the amount of sanitary measures that can be carried out at the time cholera is prevalent. Above all things to be avoided is physical exhaustion, such as is pro- duced by privation of sleep, walking to excess, or profuse perspiration. Flight is the greatest remedy in cholera. Van Someren, W. J., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-These suggestions are good. But are all ?f them practicable? I put the question with reference to guarding against "imbibing of poison." If the "potential poison" be in the air, how can any help imbibing it. Maintain- ing personal and public hygiene is the best means of preventing dissemination of the disease : while early separation of the infected from the healthy, and a cordon sanitaire, will contribute to the same end. Walker, W., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Let any medical man cast up in his memory the fatal cases of cholera which have occurred in his own practice amongst all classes of patients, and he will have it at once impressed upon him how many fell victims to a temporary lowering of their vital powers. In one case, it was the depression following the use of stimulants to excess; in another, the fatigue of a long journey, or of a shooting excursion ; in a third, exposure to cold and wet ; in a fourth, confinement and watching by a sick bed ; in a fifth, mental depression from grief or fear of the disease itself; in a sixth (and perhaps from this more than any other cause), from temporary weakness caused by slight diarrha, the result of indiscretion in diet. Query No. 6.-As to the use of quinine, particularly during the rainy season, and in malarious situations. Ailkin, W., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-Quinine I believe to be one of the best prophylac- tics when used merely as a tonic in daily small doses of two grains, without reference to season or situation. Barclay, A., Deputy Inspr. Genl., Mad. B.-I have great faith in quinine as a prophy- lactic against malarious fever. Where it does not prevent the disease, it almost invariably,  believe., renders the attack mild. My experience of it, and such has been somewhat extensive, 11
40                       REPLIES TO QUERIES ON ?H? TREATMENT OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.    [ Appendix Query No. 6,-continued. is that it affords protection against disease of every kind. On the line of march, I believe it would, be useful as a prophylactic against cholera. If diarrha were prevalent, I would com- bine it with a little opium. The treatment by hypodermic injection of quinine deserves, I think further trial. If a remedy having a specific effect on the cholera poison in the system is ever discovered, it will have, I believe, to be introduced by that method. Bruce, L. S., Surgeon, Bom. I.-Very useful in preventing or moderating attacks of fever, and thus tending to prevent the lowering of the system, should an epidemic of cholera be raging. Burn, W. H. S., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-The use of quinine, perhaps always, certainly during the rainy season, and especially in malarious situations, appears useful. Farguhar, T., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Quinine does seem to check the return of cholera at the end of its twelve hours' attack. French, J. G., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-I never knew a person who took quinine as u tonic get the disease while an epidemic was raging. Gane, II. J., Surgeon, Bom. I.-Quinine is valuable. Hooper, W. R., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-Quinine in four or five grain doses, night and morning, might be given to all in camp, and in the neighbourhood of an infected position. Although quinine may not have the power of counteracting the poison of cholera, its tonic properties would undoubtedly aid the system to resist its influence. Murray, J., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-As malaria lowers and depresses the vital powers, it is certain to render the system more susceptible to the action of cholera poison. Quinine should, therefore, be administered in malarious situations. It may also be useful under other conditions from its tonic and invigorating action. Naismith, J., Deputy Inspr. Genl., Ben. I.-Natives generally suffer from cholera in the hot season, and Europeans during the rainy season. They are not, as a rule, simultaneously attacked. Plank, C., Surgeon, Ben. I.-I have administered quinine, as a prophylactic, on a large scale. Out of 2, 600 men in my charge at that time, 127 were attacked with cholera, and 37 died. I thought at the time the daily doses of two grains of quinine strengthened the re- maining men to resist the course of the disease abroad amongst them. Price, A. G., Apothecary, Ben. I.-As a prophylactic remedy, quinine possesses great virtue. During several epidemics where my services were required in hospital, at all hours of the day and night, I always took a few grains every day, and recommended its free use to others similarly situated, and I do not remember that any of those who took the drug ever suffered from cholera. Reade, W., Surgeon, Mad. B.-Quinine and arrack, or rum, is an excellent prophylactic, I have seen the best results from its use. Sanitar, J. D., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. B.-Most beneficial as a prophylactic. Shelton, A., Surgeon Major, Mad. B.-Highly beneficial as a prophylactic, as it strengthens the system, favors vigorous circulation, and consequently the better oxidation of the blood. Simpson, D., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-At the same time, quinine should be adminis- tered, not as a curative, bat as a prophylactic agent. It may either ward off, or mitigate the severity of the attack, should the disease proceed, and the second stage be declared. Ticehurst, W, D. T., Surgeon, Bom. I.-Very beneficial. Turton, F. A., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-Quinine, in small doses, administered every morning in the rainy season, does an immensity of good. The practico was fully carried out in the 23rd R. W. Fusiliers, while I was serving with the regiment, with the best results. Wakefield, H., Surgeon, Bom. I.-No doubt beneficial, as tending to preserve a healthy state of the digestive and other organs. Williamson, W., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-Quinine should be given in the rainy season and especially in malarious districts, as it is a fact that the choleraic poison and malaria may act together. Query No. 9.-To disinfect utensils and contaminated buildings, and burn, soiled clothing, Clark, J. J., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Disinfectants have a most beneficial effect on the patient as well as on the attendants, and their use in hospitals and sick rooms cannot be too strongly urged. The most useful are carbolic acid simply diluted with water, or in combination with other substances, such as McDougall's powder and sulphate of iron, which has been found to possess powerful disinfecting properties. The latter substance is procurable in almost every bazaar, and should be freely used in and about the beds of cholera patients. De Renzy, A. C. C., Surgeon, Ben. I.-The action of disinfectants on the poison is uncer- tain. In my opinion, the only sale one is a temperature of not less than 200 F.

I.-Most beneficial in preventing the spread of the disease. Penny, J. C., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-Fumigation by manganese and salt the most certain disinfectant. In the city (Delhi) we burn fresh green wood, and regularly smoke out the houses in which cholera may have occurred. " Leepoing" also is a good means of cleans- ing vessels. Too often it happens that the clothing of those who die is claimed by the " maithers" or "mohullas," and it is difficult to make them understand the danger of keeping them. The municipality offers compensation in order to get them burned. Query No. 10.-To isolate the affected-Special attendants-Cholera hospitals should be moveable. Ailkin, W., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-The subjects of the disease should, as much as possi- ble, be isolated, and have special attendants. Cholera hospitals should be frequently changed if in tents, but fixed hospitals are in no way objectionable if properly constructed, and if due attention be paid to sanitary considerations in their management, specially as regards ventila- tion, cleanliness, and the free and constant use of disinfectants. Cullen, P., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-Of the communicability of cholera by personal contact, I have been fully impressed since 1861, when I saw many cases of it in the 1st Nagpore Irregulars, and I was myself affected in this way. It repeatedly happened that, when a party of four or five men went to the funeral of a comrade, one or two were attacked with the disease soon afterwards, and in several this happened before they returned to their lines. In my own case, I withstood the disease until a case happened that was marked by some peculiar symptoms, and being very much interested in it, I not only handled the patient but some of the soiled clothes, and was almost immediately attacked. Fasson, S. H., Surgeon Major, Mad. B.-The presence of cholera patients with other sick is objectionable ; the sight of the disease, by its depressing effects upon the other patients, pre- disposes them to become attacked. Gibbons, J., Surgeon, Mad. B.-Would be almost always impracticable and useless unless the fact is established that the disease is propagated and communicable by direct contact. At Varna, during the height of the epidemic, where many hundreds of cases were congregated in one building, under every circumstance most opposed to sanitary influence, a medical officer and a fatigue party of men from each regiment were sent down daily for a twelve hours' spell of duty in the cholera hospitals. These medical men and attendants, exposed, as it were, to concentrated contagion, did not suffer themselves, nor did they disseminate the disease on return to their respective regiments. The cases furnished by the regiments nearly all came from the fatigue parties employed about the ravines and hill sides in cutting wood for facines and gabions. o Hadaway, S. M., Inspr. Genl., Mad. B.-The affected and their special attendants should be isolated. In an outbreak in barracks, a good plan is to remove all ordinary cases from the hospital, and admit only cholera cases into it. Kennedy, J., Deputy Inspr. Genl., Mad. I.-Isolation and moveable hospitals very desirable. Lidderdale, R., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-This is a necessary measure, as it is unfair to other sick men to subject them to the sight of comrades suffering from such a painful disease as cholera, or unnecessarily to risk contagion. I have not observed the necessity of special attendants beyond what is generally forthcoming from the lines in native regiments. Nothing- could be better than to have cholera hospitals moveable for the purpose of avoiding old poisoned localities. Martin, W. T., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. B.-Isolation necessary. Tents convenient, as ground can easily be shifted. In some seasons, buildings preferable. Naismith. J., Deputy Inspr. Genl., Ben. I.-I have seen a soldier seized with cholera while counting out before me the articles of clothing from the kit of a comrade who had just died. Moore, W. J., Surgeon, Bom. I.-I would insist on effectual segregation of the sick. When cholera appears, I believe that, instead of endeavouring to conceal the fact, the men should be talked with, and encouraged to take remedies on. first feeling unwell. A convenient and efficacious form is the pill recommended by Dr. Murray, containing one part of opium, two of black pepper, and three of assaftida. Murray, T., Surgeon Major, Bom. I.-As far as possible ; and to have recourse to moveable cholera hospitals when cholera localizes itself, as at Meean Meer. The regimental hospital requires to be vacated, and thoroughly purified. Murphy, M. W., Deputy Inspr. Genl., Bom. B.-I may add that, after witnessing many epidemics of cholera in India, I have never seen a case traceable to contagion, nor have any of the orderlies, or medical officers, or attendants, been attacked in the epidemics I have seen.
42                      KEPLIES TO QUERIES ON THE TREATMENT OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.      [Appendix Query No. 10,-continued. Naismith, J., Deputy Inspr. Genl., Ben. I.-I never admitted a case of cholera into an European hospital, but into tents previously pitched at some distance oft for their reception ; trenches were dug to the leeward of the tents for receiving the alvine evacuations, which were immediately covered over with earth. Orr, J. H., Deputy Inspr. Genl., Mad. I.-The affected, together with the attendants, should be isolated as far as practicable; I cannot speak from personal experience of the advantage to be derived from a moveable hospital. Peterkin, J., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-This I think highly desirable. It has happened in my experience to find, after the admission of one case, that one or more patients previously in hospital have been attacked, and in these cases I believe the operation of the mind to have been the chief agent. In those days, we knew nothing about the fungus origin of cholera, or of its dissemination. Reade, W., Surgeon, Mad. B.-Should be at once isolated. Sick should be placed in tents, or under the shade of trees. Special servants. Moveable cholera hospitals very desirable. Rennick, R. H., Deputy Inspr. Genl., Mad. I.-A very necessary measure, and one now almost universally adopted. Old European tents make very good cholera hospitals. Roberts, W. H., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-Certainly the affected should be kept apart with special attendants, and it is unquestionably advantageous to have a moveable cholera hospital. I think, Indian experience has satisfactorily proved this point. Stewart, L. W., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-The affected should be isolated from the non- uffected, with due regard to comfort, ventilation, and the absence of overcrowding. I am not in favor of cholera hospitals being moveable, though an advocate for the removal of the patients. Sylvester, J. H., Surgeon, Bom. I.-I would certainly advocate this, and keep them as much as possible out of the sight of other people. Van Someren, W. J., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-This measure I have found useful in connec- tion with the emigration depots, in staying the progress of the disease among assemblages of proposed emigrants. Query No. 11.-Removal from the affected locality. Ailkin, W., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-All who can conveniently do so, or who are not pre- vented by necessity or duty, should remove to beyond the range of the disease ; and the removal of persons from insalubrious localities within its range should be enfored by authority, Andrews, C. A., Surgeon, Mad. I.-Should invariably be done as early as possible. In three epidemics, I removed the whole of the prisoners to higher ground, two miles from the jail, and the disease at once ceased. Ball, T., Staff Surgeon, Ben. B.-One fact stands prominently forward in the above me- lancholy history, namely, that the head quarters of the 36th Regiment were comparatively exempt from the disease, and the mortality correspondingly trivial. In the detachment, the disease was virulent, and the mortality excessive. The two bodies of men had been exposed to precisely the same influences in the same locality with the same sanitary conditions, and had been placed under circumstances not only similar and analogous, but nearly absolutely identical. [ failed to discover any local causes in the encampments selected, or in the general hygienic arrangements, to account for so remarkable a difference ; nor it is probable that foci of disease- should have been repeatedly pitched upon in the one case, and avoided in the other. But there was one important difference in the condition to which these parties were subject. One (the head quarter party) marched out of the infected locality on the first appearance of the disease, and it suffered little ; the other from unavoidable causes was detained in it for nearly a week, and suffered severely. Beat son, J. F., 0ffg. Deputy Inspire. Gel., Ben. I.-A measure of first-rate importance, but- depending for its success most materially on the manner of its execution. When disappoint- ment has attended change of locality, as in the case of the 31st Foot in 1845 at Umballa, it will generally be found to have been the result of hurry, excitement, and other avoidable causes. The season of the year may often be most unsuitable, and yet the beneficial effect may be most striking. This I have personally witnessed more than once. In illustration, I again quote from my report for 1859 the following :- "Notwithstanding the oppressive and stifling heat of the season (May), the recommendation to move the troops under canvas and to have their quarters thoroughly overhauled and disinfected was made, yet with serious anxiety and some sore misgivings, since it was considered but too probable that, if by going into camp, the 'Scylla' of cholera might be weathered, the alternative would be but to perish in the Charybdis' of fever and apoplexy." Happily, it turned out quite otherwise ; cholera was dissipated, the morale of the men restored, and a sure foundation for future confidence in the step secured. Buckle, H.. B.,  Surgeon Major, Ben.  I.-The troops should be moved at the very earliest date,  that is, as soon as the medical officer has satishfied himself of the presence of the disease,

I.-I have always been an advocate for an immediate move into camp, not only in view of avoiding local influences, but, what is of equal importance, of occupying the men and relieving their minds of the alarm and excitement which too frequently takes place on the first appearance of the epidemic. The ground to be selected should, of course, be high and dry, away from villages, exposed to a free current of air, and having a supply of good water. Distance and direction should be regulated with due regard to the course in which the disease is moving ; and, whenever practicable, a river should be crossed. Chalmers, C. B., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-Early removal from the affected locality, in an easterly direction. Cowen, H. L., Surgeon Major, Mad. B.-I have on two occasions known this to stop an epidemic. In 1853, cholera broke out in the jail at Jaffra (Ceylon). I had the prisoners at once moved out to several places, and this measure at once stopped the disease. In 1864, an epidemic of cholera appeared at Colombo (Ceylon) in the Ceylon Rifle Regiment, and on this occasion, I had the regiment broken up into several detachments, partly camped out, and partly housed at a distance from the cantonments. Cox, L. C., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-The 94th Regiment was out in camp when the thermometer stood at 112 in their tents. There was a terrible outcry that the after-results of this exposure would prove more disastrous than cholera could possibly do. And yet the actual result was that there was not a single case of sun-stroke, ardent fever, or dysentery, and the regiment is now notoriously the healthiest in the station. With proper care in the selection of a site, and with due attention to the comfort of the men, I feel certain that no danger need be apprehended in moving into camp in the hottest weather, so long as the men are protected from direct solar exposure ; I mean, so long as they get into their tents from off a march before the sun has become high. The necessity of this measure, when cholera has gained a footing in a station, is too well established a fact to need any further proofs. I should hold myself highly culpable if I neglected, for a single day, this all-important measure. Crawford, J. W., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Removal from the affected locality, at right angles to the prevailing winds, to an encampment on the highest dry open ground within easy distance, so as not to fatigue the men, has, in my experience, a most marked and decided effect in arresting the disease. I have found the distance of a mile even sufficient for this purpose. Callen, P., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-The natives believe in the contagiousness of the disease. It was no uncommon thing in Wurdah, in 1865, to enter a village and find no one but the dead and the dying ; every one that was able to leave had left, and in some cases, the inhabitants actually set fire to their villages to prevent the spread of the disease. Daly, G. H., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Removal from the affected locality has always been attended by unquestionably good results, and might always be resorted to except under very unfavour- able and special circumstances, such as the want of proper accommodation, of the presence of very yet weather, when the removal will be necessarily attended by fatigue, exhaustion and exposure. The distance to be travelled over ought always to be short, and the locality chosen ought to be high, dry, shady, and distant from sheets of water and villages. The direction of the march should be at an angle to the then prevailing winds. Daun, H. T., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-The vessel Elphinstone was anchored in Bombay harbour off the Cotton Bunder, and one night we had five cases of cholera among the sailors. The sick were sent on shore, the wood of the deck where the ejecta had fallen, was scraped and disinfected, the vessel went out to sea, and not a single case of cholera occurred on board afterwards. DeFabeek, F. W. ?., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-The force was marched out into an open piece of ground previously selected, about three miles to the south-west, and to windward of the station. The move proved to be a judicious one, for not a single case occurred in the force thus encamped, and the only sufferers were among those left behind for guard duty. Elliot, R. C., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. B.-Removal from the affected locality is the first thing to be attempted, and, as a rule, has always proved beneficial. Fogo, J. M. S., Surgeon Major, Ben. B.-If cholera is prevailing in a large native community in India, it is better to get away from it as far as possible ; and the further the removal, the less is the chance of communication. The most rigid quarantine is liable to be broken. In the case of troops, the circumstances in which they are placed being so different, it is believed that, when cholera appears among them, it is best to consider only the building in which cholera has appeared to be affected, and to move the men out of it to a properly selected quarantine ground. The step is likely to be quite effective with them, and the removal need not be to a great distance. Gibbons, J., Surgeon, Mad. B.-My experience leads me to believe, that during the prevalence of an epidemic, the influence or action of the cholera poison is localized, it may be in a single establishment, as a jail or in one barrack in a cantonment, or again in a town, in a district, or in a tract of country. I consider that removal is the first and greatest precautionary measure, provided such movement be to beyond or outside of the choleraic influence. In 1850, the infected companies of the 44th Regiment were moved from Valetta to Gozo Island, about three hours' steaming, A case died on board between the two islands, and 12
44                     REPLIES TO QUERIES ON THE TREATMENT OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.     [Appendix Query No. 11,-continued. some cases occurred during the 36 hours subsequent to removal from Valetta ; but the plague was stayed, and those fresh cases did not prove fresh sources of contamination. At Neemuch, in 1860, when cholera was in the regimental hospital of the 95th Regiment, three cases originated amongst the patients, following each other in succession, in a space of 16 hours. The patients, 60 in number, and the establishment, were at once removed into tents on an elevated ridge two miles to windward of the cantonments, and no further cases originated amongst the hospital patients, although cases were received from the barracks, and treated in a row of tents contiguous. Guise, J. A., Deputy Inspector General. Ben. I.-The benefit resulting from this step is un- questionable, and it is greatly to be regretted that so useful a measure should be rendered liable to miscarriage, by not leaving more discretion to the local authorities, as to the circumstances and manner in which it should be carried out. Holloway, J., Surgeon Major, Ben. B.-I consider that troops occupying old cantonments or fortresses, should move out sooner on the appearance of cholera among them than those quartered on new sites, the air of the former being more or less impure, and the soil generally infiltrated with animal and vegetable matters. The cantonments may possibly be less tainted with the disease than the surrounding district, and by affording ample room in barracks, by putting half of the occupants in tents, many of the disadvantages of a move to a cholera camp in bad weather will be avoided. These are, bad cooking, wet bedding and clothing, and great personal discomfort ; and even with the most liberal allowance of tents and carriage, men in camp must be closely packed, or else the labor of pitching and striking camp will be excessive. Yet massing men in any degree in such times is much to be avoided, as favouring the spread of the disease, and the greatest purity and free play of air in tents seems necessary to afford security. At native fairs and pilgrimages, where the people in masses occupy light tents or newly-erected shelters, the disease often originates and spreads rapidly, in spite of the structural advantages of such tenements, and, latterly, of good sanitation as well. We cannot but reflect how often the troops left in an affected cantonment remain comparatively free from the disease, while it pursues relentlessly those who have left it for camp. Hastings, T., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-I consider an early removal from the affect- ed locality of great importance. I will mention one instance of the good to be derived from it, which occurred under my observation. In 1865, in July, cholera broke out in the jail at Agra, at night, first among the female prisoners. Next morning, these women and several hundred men were moved into camp, and on the following morning more were sent out ; in all 900 still remained whom we could not move for want of tents. Among those so moved but another case occurred, while among those who remained in the jail, cases continued to occur almost daily for nearly one month. Hendley, J., Surgeon, Ben. B.-A most important measure ; and, in the case of soldiers, frequent change of encamping ground seems advantageous. Holmes, A. W., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-Epidemic cholera appeared in Kohat on the 11th July 1867, but the first case in the regiment (1st Sikh Infantry) was on the 29th of the month ; another man was seized on the 7th August, and two more on the 10th. The regi- ment moved into camp on the 11th, and afterwards not a single case occurred in camp. Machan, ?., Surgeon, Bom. ? -I am of opinion that epidemic cholera is preventible, and that it can be excluded from any community by the adoption of proper sanitary measures, such as the complete isolation of the affected and of those who have had communication with them, the prevention of all intercommunication between the sick and healthy, and between the latter and affected localities, and people coming from the localities and also by a pure water supply, the greatest care being taken that none of this supply comes from impure or cholera-poisoned sources. Boiling the water is an additional security. A pure atmosphere and plenty of breathing space, especially at night, when people are less likely to enjoy these means of security, is necessary. Macpherson, H. M., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-Early removal from an affected bar- rack is most important, and should that not suffice, the troops ought to be sent into camp in a direction other than that in which the epidemic is travelling. If a river could be placed between them and the locality they have quitted, it would be a great additional advantage. The camp should be changed frequently until the epidemic disappears. McRae, D., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-I entirely approve of the removal of troops and prisoners into camp on the appearance of epidemic cholera. When the heat of the weather vises to 120 in tents as it often does in the Punjab in June and July, I am of opinion that troops should not be sent into camp, except as the very last resource. I do not think that specific rules can be laid down, or that the measure necessary for one epidemic will be found equally useful in another, or even at different periods of the same outbreak. Moir, R., Surgeon, Ben. I.-On the 25th July 1867, measures were at once taken for removing all the women, (except 10) without the walls, and for sending them to Secundra. This was effected early on the following morning, and with this good result that only one woman was attacked on the road, and she recovered. A few cases of choleraic diarrha, which showed themselves after arrival, did not prove serious. The male prisoners already at Secuudra were sent into tents at the further corner of the garden, to make room for the women, and

Martin, W. T., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. B.-This is, in my opinion, the best measure to be adopted. Removal of the individuals amongst whom cholera has appeared is generally sufficient. Mee, J., Surgeon Major, Bom. B.-Recommended, when cholera is near or approaching a military station, that every precaution be made, tents pitched and carts loaded with cots, so that the troops may be marched off on the sound of the bugle ; and on the occurrence of the first case of cholera, or of some cases of choleraic diarrha, that the room or barrack in which they appear be vacated, and that it be lime-washed, cleaned, and well ventilated previous to re-occupation. Mercer, Major, Deputy Commr., Ben. C. S.-A pilgrim arrived at Wadala suffering from cholera. The hakeem who attended him lost his son and daughter from the infection, and the disease spread rapidly. Between the 7th and 14th May, 29 persons were attacked, of whom 6 died. Mills, J:, Surgeon Major, Bom. I.-Removal from affected locality advantageous, even at risk of some exposure to weather and other unfavourable conditions. Morice, J. C., Surgeon, Ben. I.-A sweeper, who had been in attendance on a gunner (European) in the artillery hospital who had died of cholera, was attacked the next day, and died in a few hours. A dresser belonging to the artillery hospital was attacked and died, and his brother, who attended on him during his illness, also took the disease and died. The bheesty employed in the cholera hospital was also attacked. Morton, G. E., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-The hill station of Murree (7,000 feet above the level of the sea) suffered from the cholera epidemic of 1867. Several deaths took place among the European community, and natives suffered still more severely. At one time a sort of panic occurred among the hill-men and native servants, many of whom deserted the place. Munro, W., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. B.-As far as our present knowledge and experience extends, removal from affected localities is the only safeguard. I have seen this proved both in the West and East Indies, during epidemics of yellow fever and cholera. Munro, W., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. B.-In the outbreak at Peshawur of October 1862, immediately after crossing the Indus, the feelings of nausea, cramps and griping pains left us ; there was no return of cholera, no diarrha, and very few cases of remittent fever and intermittent fever of the quotidian type, became the prevailing disease. Murphy, M. W., Deputy Inspector General, Bom. B.-Removal under certain circumstances is advisable, but it is not, according to my experience, the very essential object generally supposed. Murray, J., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-During an outbreak of cholera, to remove the healthy from the locality where the epidemic exists, is the most certain and effectual precaution that can be taken. Naismith, J., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-As far as my experience extends, I have never known any subsequent bad effects from the men going into camp, even during the rains. On the contrary, the change is favourable to their health and spirits, the open air recreations of camp life support their mental and physical energies, and divert their thoughts from the gloomy apprehension which an invasion of cholera is sure to awaken. Orr, J. H., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. I.-Removal from the affected locality, when it can be carried out, is very desirable. Prosunno Coomar Dass, Native Doctor, Ben. I.-On the 30th April, three days after the arrival of the Hard war pilgrims, the cholera broke out in the fort. Three persons were taken ill the same day. About four miles to the west of Khetree is a small hamlet situated in a vast bed of sand, surrounded on all sides with hills. Here the death rate was about 50 per cent. A family consisting of four members were all taken ill in the night, and died in the morning. The inhabitants fled away, and thus saved themselves. Reynolds, J. A., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. I.-Removal from a cantonment to a distant camp has always proved beneficial in my experience. Rennick, R. H., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. I.-Not always attended with the desired results in hot weather, or during the monsoons. Cholera broke out about a year ago in H. M/s 3rd Regiment stationed at Meerut. The regiment was immediately moved into camp and made short marches daily, but notwithstanding, the mortality was frightful. A son of mine serving in the corps had to bury upwards of 30 corpses together on one occasion. Roberts, W. H., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-Certainly, leave the spot by all means if possible. Our best endeavours should be directed to the accomplishment of this object. Sannders, G., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I. -Whatever may be the cause or causes which induce cholera, there can, I think, be no doubt that its origin is intimately associated with the habitation of man : 1 must, therefore, consider it an act of prudence to at once remove large bodies of men from their habitations, when once epidemic cholera has assailed them,

I.-I recommend removal from affected locality. Sutherland, J, Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-In the event of an epidemic outbreak, the sooner the troops are moved away from an impure locality the better. The distance need not be great, as the poison is only potent in the immediate vicinity. I do not think that moving troops into camp, provided the arrangements are carefully attended to, would of necessity be attended with very great danger, either in the hot or rainy season. It is also, m my opinion, a most desirable arrangement to have a preliminary camp for 200 men ready, as proposed, m epidemic seasons, when the disease is approaching. Sylvester, J. H., Surgeon, Bom. I.-Above all things necessary. Thom, W., Deputy Inspector General, Bom. I.-Desirable for the mental effect on the soldiers, if for no other purpose. Van Someren, W. J., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-In one or two instances, in my experience, this step has been necessary, and it was followed by the early disappearance of the disease. Ward, T. W., Deputy Inspector General, Bom. I.-A most important measure. Williams, H. T., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Often puts a stop to further spreading, as I have fre- quently found by experience. In one instance, the removal of the prisoners from the Burdwan jail to the guard shed immediately outside the Avails, checked the disease, and 110 more cases appeared. Williams, H. T., Surgeon, Ben. I.-On the 24th April, the first case of cholera occurred in the city (Ferozepore), in the person of Gunga Dass, who had not been to Hurdwar, but had returned from Jullundur, via Loodiana, on the evening of the 23rd, in a dk garry, in com- pany  with pilgrims. The first and only fatal case was contracted by a sepoy who visited his village (where the disease had been introduced by returned pilgrims) in the morning, and re- turned in the evening : soon afterwards he was attacked, and died the same night. The other four cases recovered. The whole of the men were moved into camp, and no cases occurred afterwards, Williams, W., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-Removal from an infected locality is a measure to be recommended in every outbreak, as the disease can be introduced by men and by the stools. It should be a rule that any men coming from an infected district should be kept by themselves, and should use separate latrines for some days. Whittall, R., Retired Surgeon, Ben. I.-An old woman, running away from Deyrah for fear of the cholera, was taken ill with cholera at our gate at Mussoorie, and was carried into the hut of one of the artizans. Four in that house were attacked, three died, one recovered, and the original old woman recovered. Wright, T., Surgeon, Ben. B.-Immediately, and to a considerable distance, and at right angles to the prevailing winds. Query No. 12.-To exclude affected individuals, or fomites. Blyth, W. E., Deputy Commissioner, Ben. G. S.-A pilgrim was taken ill of cholera at noon on the 28th April 1867, at a well in the village of Jhooghkullan, and he died next day. His soiled clothes were washed in an adjacent pond. Other parties, who afterwards visited the well and the pond for water and ablution, caught the infection. The disease broke out on the 30th, and up to the 15th May, 53 were attacked, of whom 27 died. Bow, J. C., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Of the three cases, one might, by some, be quoted on the side of contagion. He had been in hospital for several months with secondary syphilis ; he attended all night on an old comrade brought in with cholera, was seized with the disease, and died first. Bow, J. C., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-When cholera was prevalent in Allahabad in the European regiments, by far the greater number of cholera cases occurred among the patients in hospital. At a time when there was no cholera in Allahabad, 75 prisoners from Jubbulpore, affected with cholera, arrived ; they had met on the road a cholera-stricken Madras regiment and a cartman, and one prisoner had died previous to arrival. Collins, J., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-Not a single case occurred in the Moradabad jail during the year, though both the European and Native troops suffered from it, as well as the police and natives of the city. This was, I am iuclind to think, owing to the fact of all the prisoners being thoroughly examined and questioned before being allowed inside the jail. The servants of the jail were similarly questioned and examined, and if found suffering from diarrha, or if their friends were found to be suffering from cholera, they were allowed leave for ton days ; and if, at the end of that time, no further sickness had occurred in their houses, they were allowed to return to duty. Corbyn, J. C., Surgeon, Ben. I.-On the 2nd May 1867, cholera first broke out in the Bareilly District among the pilgrims on their way home from the great fair at Hurdwar. These persons carried the contagion wherever they went,

I.-The Nusseeree Battalion, of which I had medical charge, marched from Jutog on the 24th of May 1857, and halted the first night at Subathoo. Cholera was then very prevalent in the depot of the European regiment at that station, and also among the coolies. We passed six dead bodies of the latter on the road from Subathoo to the plains. One of our men was attacked with suspicious symptoms near Kalka, but no real, or rather fully developed, cases of cholera occurred till we had gone as far as the second or third march from Umballa on the road to Seharunpore. The epidemic then commenced and continued in the regiment for some three weeks. There was no cholera in the Seharunpore District when we arrived, and none occurred in consequence of our arrival. The disease \vas exclusively confined to the Goorkbas. DeRenzy, A. C. C., Surgeon, Ben. I-The number of deaths in the city and suburbs from this disease was about 500 ; there was not a single case in the jail. This fortunate result is due, there can be no doubt, to the high standard of health of the prisoners, and to the efforts made to prevent the introduction of the germ of cholera through the agency of new prisoners, or of the jail establishment. Durant, J. J., Assistant Surgeon, Sen. I.-It has often occurred to me that the disease in Lower Bengal is chiefly propagated in this way, the water consumed by the people being generally out of tanks and ponds, or very shallow wells entirely surrounded by habitations of all kinds, and into which sewers and drains of every description empty themselves. What greater facilities could exist for the contamination of water by the poison of cholera in a country where the disease is known to be endemic at all times ? Elton, H. N., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Of 48 pilgrims who reached Pashroor, 6 got the disease ; of these 3 died, and the rest recovered. The shopkeeper who supplied them with all the articles of diet took the disease and died on the next day. At Seeramwallee (a town nearly 22 miles south of Sealkote), a pilgrim by stealth returned home while he was suffering from, this disease (cholera), and died within a short time after his arrival. The son and daughter of the hakeem who treated him got the disease three days after the return of the above pilgrim, and died within 24 hours. Fasson, S. H., Surgeon Major, Mad. B.-To exclude affected individuals as far as prac- ticable is very desirable : affected clothes should invariably be excluded. Gardener, E. B., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-At the village of Besabat, two men who had returned from the Hurdwar fair died of cholera on the 30th April 1867, and their clothes were not burned according to orders given, but were washed in a pond which was inside the village, the water of which was used for domestic purposes. On the 1st and 2nd of May, in the same village, 16 attacks occurred. Harris, W. P., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I,-The disease first appeared (at Budaon) with the Hurdwar pilgrims in April 1867. For nearly two months the disease was scarcely felt, and then all of a sudden it broke out, assuming a virulent form, and caused dreadful havoc among the population. It appears to be very evident that the cholera poison lay dormant for the period for want of some favourable circumstance for its growth, and that when this was sup- plied, either by the changes of the atmosphere or habits of the people (probably the former), the poison became fully developed, gained strength, and spread in different directions. Jackson, J. R., Surgeon, Ben, I.-Not one case occurred in the Meerut jail. From the known fact of its transmissibility from individual to individual, we may reasonably come to the conclusion that the separation of the prisoners and the system of quarantine may have had something to say to this favourable result. MacLeod, A. C., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-There can be no doubt that large bodies will carry the disease along with them, infecting the towns and villages through which they pass. No regiment, therefore, or other concourse of human beings affected with cholera, should be allowed to approach within some miles of a town. It should be made to halt, or to make a detour. To exclude the entry of solitary individuals, especially at night, would be almost im- possible. I should not, however, be apprehensive of much danger on that score. It is by masses of humanity, as I have before observed, that the integrity of the cholera poison is pre- served. Break up the mass and disperse the fragments, and the disease is at once at an end ; or in the same way, detach from the mass solitary individuals still unaffected, and they will themselves escape having the disease and lose the power of infecting others. The only danger would be in the conceivable case of an individual who, having taken the infection outside, should be seized, after entering the town. With a view to adopt every possible precaution, such a case should be isolated, if practicable. McRae, D., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-The first case of cholera in this circle occurred on the 23rd April 1867, at the ferry over the Beas river, on the grand trunk road ; a hospi- tal had been established at this place under the charge of a sub-assistant surgeon. On the 24th, two cases were reported in the town of Umritsur, and on the 26th, Dr. Smith reported a case in the city of Lahore in a child. Ten thousand pilgrims had in the meantime reached the city. The disease continued to follow the course of the pilgrims, and was carried by them far and wide into every province of the Punjab Government. 13

Among the prisoners in jail, there have been 44 admissions from cholera, 24 of which were fatal. The cases occurred in four jails only out of 12, viz., at Umritsur, Dhurmsalla, Goojranwalla, and in the female jail at Lahore. Taking into consideration the general features of the disease of 1867, as it occurred in the Punjab, and also of individual instances, of which an indefinite number might be adduced, it appears impossible to arrive at any other conclusion regarding cholera than that it is a conta- gious and infectious disease. Norgate, Captain, Cantonment Magistrate, Sealkote.-Whatever may have been the course of the disease in other years, in this year (1867), its track was easily discoverable; wherever it occurred it was traced either to some pilgrims having stayed at the villages, or to some one who had come from an infected village. Nowhere did it seem to appear sooner than a human being could move from one place to another. O'Donel, F. H., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Cholera first broke out in a village close to the regi- mental hospital. Green wood fires were burnt between the village and hospital ; a guard was stationed to prevent communication, and the men were directed to remain in their lines. No person was attacked with that dire disease within the cantonments. Peterkin, J., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-When I first went to Cuddapah, the disease appeared to have an almost endemic character there. The people of the town, or inmates of the jail, seemed never entirely free from attacks. During my residence there of seven years, great attention was paid to the introduction of improved sanitary measures generally, apparently with the best results ; especially it was considered advisable to prevent pilgrims from Iriputty and Kurnool from entering the town, as they always seemed to bring with them some cases of cholera, and to leave the seed of it behind. Preventing these pilgrims from entering the town greatly lessened the attacks, and during the last two years of my residence, attacks by cholera were rare, and hardly even to be heard of, either in the town or jail. The clothes of the pri- soners were always taken from them on incarceration. Rajkissen Mookerjee, Sub-Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I,-No indigenous case arose except from contact with a pilgrim. Tulloch, J., Surgeon, Ben. B.-I would observe that a considerable number of the medical profession, and a large proportion of those out of it, still hold to the opinion that cholera is not contagious, infectious, or in any way communicable from one person to another, or of being- conveyed by means of clothing, &c. I may be allowed here to relate one or two of the circumstances which led me to believe in the communicability of the disease. In 1857, the year of the mutiny, I was stationed with a detachment of my regiment, the 10th Foot, at Benares. We arrived there 011 the 29th May. On 4th June, the mutiny occurred there ; and after this the troops and inhabitants were confined to such limited space and accommodation as could be best defended by a small body of troops. A small staff barrack was set apart as a hospital, and it soon became crowded from various sources. Towards the end of June (I cannot now give precise dates), a man of the detachment was seized with cholera, and was brought into the hospital verandah ; further isolation was, under the circumstances, impossible. Two of the patients nearest to the cholera patient were seized with cholera and died. This of itself made no great impression at the time ; but after six weeks, there being no cholera in the station during that time, when men were being hurried up the country by bullock train, some of them happened to be attacked with the disease when near Benares, and were sent into our small hospital, and again the disease broke out among the patients in hospital. These facts were noted as remarkable, but were attributed to local causes. In course of time greater security was felt at the station, and other buildings were occu- pied. A large airy bungalow was given over as another hospital, so as to relieve the small barrack of all but the sick of our own detachment. Into this new hospital, where no cholera patient had ever been, men passing up country affected with the disease were received, and here also it spread among the patients in hospital. These accumulated facts afforded to my mind convincing evidence that the disease is communicable. I will now refer briefly to an outbreak of cholera on board ship at sea 24 days after leaving port, which I conceive to be illustrative of the opinion that cholera poison may be conveyed otherwise than by personal communication. On 21st May 1859, I embarked at Calcutta on the ship Gertrude in medical charge of a party of wounded and other invalid soldiers for England. Cholera was then universally prevalent in Calcutta, and in several troop ships that had sailed earlier in the season the disease broke out when they were in the river- a circumstance which caused serious apprehension for our safety at this advanced season, and, I may add, led to our using every available sanitary precaution. Having reached the equator without any signs of cholera, we congratulated ourselves on what we believed to be our escape. But it was not so : for, on the 15th of June, when in the 4th degree of south latitude, and 24 days from all communication with the shore, hundreds of miles from land, the weather hot and steamy, but not unusual for that latitude, a soldier, invalided for ophthalmia (then convalescent from dysentery contracted on board), was seized in the morning and died next day. On the same morning, the chief officer of the ship, perhaps the strongest aud healthiest man on board, was seized and died in 31/2 hours. In the afternoon, a soldier's child, a boy 6 years of

On the 20th, a soldier, recovering from dysentery, was attacked and died on the 21st ; and on the 25th, a strong healthy sailor was seized and died next day. If we admit that the cholera poison is of a specific nature, we must admit, reasoning from the above instance, that it was brought in the ship from Calcutta. It could neither have been generated in the ship, nor wafted in the air from a mephitic shore. How and why it exerted its influence at this particular time, and not before or after it, it is unnecessary here to enquire. The Creole population, and many of the English residents of the Mauritius, are strongly impressed with the opinion, that in all the severe attacks of cholera which have visited that island, the disease was brought from India in coolie ships. I visited the colony in 1854, shortly after a most fatal outbreak had just passed over, and heard several circumstantial statements of how the disease had been brought down by the "dirty Malabars." Some four years ago, I met with a small book, descriptive of Mauritius and the manners and customs of the inhabitants, entitled "Creoles and Coolies'' by the Revd. Patrick Beaton, a Presbyterian minister who had resided several years in the island, and during the time of two outbreaks of cholera. The author enters into the question of the infectious nature of the disease, and records the results of his own observation, as well as that of several of the resident members of the medical profession. The conclusion arrived at by a non-medical observer, having no theory to support, may be received as at least unbiassed, and I will here transcribe one of the extracts I made from his book at the time :-" In November cholera broke out at Flag. The circumstances connected with "its appearance in that district are curious and seem to prove beyond a doubt what few in "Mauritius would now deny, that cholera is infections, and that places infected may retain the "seeds of infection for a considerable period after the disease has disappeared from a locality. "In Flag, there was a shop where two persons had died during the time of the first epidemic, "and since that time the shop had remained shut. On the 13th November, a woman of the "name of Alfred, the sister-in-law of the proprietor of the shop, took it into her head to look "whether a shawl which she had left in the shop was still there. She caused a shutter to be "opened, and on putting only her head inside, she was repelled by the offensive odour exhaled from "the room, and immediately withdrew ; the same night she was taken ill and next day she "died. Her adopted child, two years of age, was attacked the same day, and died after an "illness of 24 hours. From her house, the epidemic spread in a gradually increasing circle, "and no less than 78 cases of cholera presented themselves after it had ceased for more than "three months in every other part of the island, with the exception of the solitary case of "this family and those around." Verchere, A. M., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-There were 21 fighting-men, 4 camp followers, and one native doctor on duty at the cholera camp, Jullunder, 1867; 4 men were admitted, and two died. All of these men were perfectly well before they left the lines ; and not a case of cholera, or even of diarrha, occurred in the lines, while these four cases occurred among the 26 men who came in contact with the pilgrims. Query No. 14.-House to house visitation, and distribution of medicine.   Early treatment. Brown, J. C., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-Prompt treatment in the barracks is of the first importance. The old cholera pill and brandy and laudanum is very useful. I believe internal treatment beneficial only in the early stages. Carter, H. V., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I-The baids consider early treatment essential, and opiates are almost entirely ignored. The "Marwarrees" of Sattara trust entirely to "ghee," and it is said that even four or five seers are occasionally given. Clark, S., Surgeon, Ben. I.-The most that can be said on this point is, that the first stage of the disease is, to a certain extent, if not quite, as amenable to treatment as any of the other epidemic diseases of a virulent character, but unfortunately medical aid is very rarely called in at this stage. Ringer, T., Surgeon, Ken. I.-In our present state of ignorance, both as to the nature of the choleraic poison, and of any specific remedy for the disease, prophyloctic and precautionary treatment during an outbreak of the disease should be vigorously carried out. The advantages of both have been so clearly and ably laid down by Dr. J. Murray, Inspector General of Hospitals, in his report on the pathology and treatment of cholera, that I can only add that I thoroughly concur in all he has written, and I anticipate that much good may be effected if his excellent suggestions are carried out. Simpson, D., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-The disease to be successfully combatted must be attacked at its earliest manifestations, or even before it has assumed its characteristic form. In great or in complete collapse, it is likely to remain unaffected by remedies, because the circulation and the functions of the absorbents are then in abeyance. But then it is possible to fortify the system in the first stage, so that the attack shall be withstood altogether, modified in type, or moderated in virulence.

Query No. 1.-General Indications-To remove the poison of the cholera from the body. Bateson, R. S., Surgeon, Ben. I.-The poison manifestation is such that it requires sub- duing rather than assisting by use of purgatives and so called poison-eliminating agents. Donaldson, J., Surgeon, Mad. I.-We cannot eliminate the poison, I am convinced, by any evacuatory processes which we can employ. Nature will do the work, and save life where it is possible to do so, if we aid her and support the strength. Duckworth,  F., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-As there is very little doubt that cholera is caused by the absorption of some subtle but material poison, which is rapidly circulated and quickly pervades every part and tissue of the body, the first indication points  to the necessity of assisting nature  in  its  effort  to eliminate this poison through the natural channels of the human frame. Gibbons, J., Surgeon, Mad. B.-I look on the prominent symptoms of a choleraic seizure, vomitting and purging, as already fulfilling the indication of ridding the body of the poison. These being in excess may prove fatally exhaustive ; but from a large and sad experience, I think I have observed that in the cases where vomitting and purging have both been present, there was active and violent re-action, and recovery often ensued. On the contrary, cases marked by the absence of the effort of nature at elimination are most surely and rapidly fatal. This leads one to speculate in the first instance whether a small dose of the poison or one insufficient to prove fatal to the individual has been imbibed, and whether the effort of nature ejected the poison ; or whether in the second instance, the dose has been an overwhelming one, or the power of resistance in the individual less. Such a theory sufficiently accounts for the fatality of the disease and its proved intractability to remedial measures. But although the indications of treatment have been carried out with all the resources of science and skill, no impression has as yet been made on the death-rate of the disease. Gordon, A., Inspector General, Bom. B.-So far as my opinion is concerned, I believe that we are as ignorant of the pathology of cholera as when the disease first occupied the attention of medical practitioners in 1817, and that a successful or rational mode of treatment has yet to be discovered. The remedies which have hitherto been proposed for the cure of cholera I believe to be utterly valueless, and I am inclined to think that patients treated without medicine have as good a chance of recovery as those who are drugged. Irving, J., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Of only one thing do I feel certain; and that is that it is only in the premonitory and first stage that medicine is of any use at all, and that much, if not all, of the physic given in the latter stages of the malady might, with equal advantage, be thrown into the close stool at once, rather than allowed to pass there by the more tedious route of the intestines ; for where there is no power of absorption, medicine must and does pass unaltered. Lord, R. G., Surgeon Major, Bom. I.-The treatment by eliminants in the earlier stages of the disease is not one that would seem to be supported either by reason or results. In the third or re-actionary stage if the vomitting and purging have ceased, and the urinary excretion has not been re-established and the escape of the urea thus effected, then what may be called the elimination treatment may be appropriately resorted to ; the object being not to eliminate the cholera poison from the system, but to produce such a discharge as shall afford a means of escape for the agency which is producing the coma. The accumulation of urea in the blood is provided against by the watery evacuations, and when these cease, its poisonous effects become manifest by a tendency to coma ; the blood is rendered unfit for the proper support of the large nervous centres, and so death results from the failure of their influence. McDowall, C., Surgeon, Bom. I.-The watery purging in cholera does not void the "poison," but only the "germ" of the poison of cholera ; it is only after this has been for some time out of the body, and after fermentation or decomposition has taken place, that the stools become an irritant poison. Pettenkoffer, the Cholera Conference, and almost all physicians unanimously recognize the fact that, as harmless fresh grape juice contains the germ of the poison alcohol, so the recent cholera evacuations contain the germ of the poison of cholera. This is proved by the success of stopping preliminary diarrha. Seeing that, according to the above theory, the stools are not properly poisonous till after they have been some time out of the body and decomposed, and that stopping of preliminary diarrha has universally been acknowledged to be the most successful mode of treatment ; and seeing also that the watery and saline purging renders the blood thick, poisonous, and in- capable of circulating, and brings the secreting and absorbing organs to a dead stand still, and almost infallibly causes death either in collapse or by urmic after-poisoning ; seeing all this, it is advisable to moderate the watery purging both in preliminary diarrha and even in collapse. Astringents, opium, &c., properly guarded by cholagogues and diuretics are of great use when cautiously given. In cholera especially, medicines should be injected under the skin. The cold douche (first tried by the Surgeon of the 72nd Regiment) is a grateful remedy and a powerful stimulant. The moderating of the rice-water purging of choleraic diarrha and cholera is a powerful mode also of preventing the spread of infection.

C., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-Restoration of function is impossible so long as the poison remains in the blood unneutralised. When once eliminated into the bowels, thence to be dejected by stool, the poison may be said to be out of the blood, and in some sense out of the system. Simultaneously with this purification of the blood, and if sufficient vital- ity remains after such an exhaustive process, the hitherto suspended secretions will begin to flow spontaneously. We may assist firstly, and indirectly, by artificially augmenting the vitality of the system ; secondly, and more directly, by the use of remedies calcu- lated to act on the organs whose secretions more particularly it is important to res- tore. Whenever I use the term "neutralisation," I would wish it to be understood that I simply mean that unknown process by which the cholera poison is rendered innocuous ; it may be neutralisation, or disorganization, or decomposition, or even simple dilution. By an excess of stimulants during the active stage of the disease, or by their protracted use when no longer needed, I fear that many have been lost. A still more violent form of re-action, however, is that which succeeds the use of opium, or of other astringents. It is as if a strong tide had been temporarily restrained by a dam, to burst forth with redoubled and fatal force. Simpson, D., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-The treatment of cholera by emetics and pur- gatives is contra-indicated, as its only tendency is to depress the already overtaxed nervous system ; and besides, such treatment has not the power of eliminating the materies morbi. Stewart, L. C., Deputy Inspector General, Bom. I.-I have seen every mode of treatment adopted, in numerous cholera outbreaks, great and small, and I have come to the unsatisfactory conclusion that success in the treatment of the disease is not greater now-a-days than in my first experience in 1842. I believe that very many seizures are averted by sanitary precautions and prompt treatment of the premonitory symptoms, but a confirmed attack is not more likely to recover under one mode of treatment than another. Sutherland, J., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-I regard the doctrine of elimination, when applied to cases of cholera, to be one of the fallacies of the faculty, and the practice to which it leads, most dangerous. In the case of a person who is under the influence of a poisonous dose of opium, or who has been bitten by a venomous snake, do we attempt to eliminate the poison ; does not experience show that all our efforts should be confined to support the system for a while, knowing, if we can do this, that nature will rid the system of the poison. I regard the vomitting and purging of cholera to be the morbid action of the poison, and in no way connected with its elimination. Would any one say that the action of antimony in causing vomitting and purging was the result of an effort of nature to eliminate the drug from the system. Townsend, S. C., Surgeon, Ben. I.-The cholera poison may be received into the body and eliminated from it without producing the violent effects that constitute true cholera. Whether it does so or not appears to depend very much upon the state of the individual when the poison is imbibed. Any circumstance that depresses the nervous system, such as fatigue of body, anxiety of mind, previous excess in wine, or a dose of aperient medicine, apparently renders a person exposed to the morbid influence more amenable to its effects. In fact, the nervous system in one individual resists the action of the poison, and it passes out of the body without any or after but slightly injurious effects ; while in another, or in the same individual under different circumstances, the nervous system succumbs to the morbid influence, and the symptoms of cholera are fully produced. Trestrail, J. C., Surgeon Major, Bom. I.-I have had very considerable experience in the treatment of cholera, for which I have tried calomel, bichlorid of mercury, opium, Condy's fluid, acid halleri, bleeding from the arm and foot, friction, heat applied to the body and extremities, salines (soda, chlorate of potash, and salt), and stimulants of all kinds. Finding all of these fail, I have ceased to have faith in any. Heat, frictions, and stimulants I should rely on more than on any other treatment. Walker, W., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Honest investigation will prove that the physician who discards all attempts to cure the disease itself, but waits expectant on nature, aiding her efforts and using those auxiliaries which are found useful in relieving individual symptoms, will have a larger percentage of recoveries amongst his patients than the man who prescribes specific remedies to cure the sufferers. Query No. 8.-The different stages of the disease require different remedies. Banister, G., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-This axiom should never be lost sight of. I have witnessed irretrievable mischief from the plan of treatment by calomel and opium, and stimu- lants being continued in collapse. I have to confess that in my own practice I have lost many patients from enteritis and meningitis who might have escaped these evils had I with- held calomel and opium when the circulation failed. Query No. 9.-The primary action of the poison depresses or paralyses the sympathetic and ganglionic nerves, and diminishes or suppresses the secretions of the organs supplied by them. Banister, G., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Arrest of capillary circulation, which is presided over by the vaso-motor system of nerves, is certainly the first obvious and palpable effect of 14

[Appendix Query No. 9,-continued. the cholera poison ; for vomitting and purging seldom come on before the circulation is some- what impeded. Barnard, G., Surgeon, Ben. I.-It produces, or in its essence it is an inflammation, specific or non-specific, no matter which, of the mucous membrane of the stomach and small intestines. Blackclock, A., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-It excites the ganglia at first. The excite- ment endures during the cold stage. Ganglionic debility may be paralysis following the over-excitement, Chalmers, C. B., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-I am inclined to this opinion. Cases are constantly seen where a patient vomits a meal which he has eaten, say, on the day before the morning of the seizure, without any trace of assimilation having taken place ; and all the symptoms of the disease point to this. Clementson, F. L., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-Very probably there is depression or paralysis of the sympathetic and ganglionic system ; but whether the secretions are dimi- nished, suppressed, or only suspended, remains an open question. Daly, G. H, Surgeon, Ben. I.-My belief is that the primary action, or direct action of the cholera poison, is on the blood, after being introduced either by the respiratory, digestive, or integumentary apparatus ; and secondarily only on the sympathetic or gang- lionic system, which it depresses or paralyses, causing diminution or suppression of the secretions of the organs supplied by it. Davis, W. F., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-I believe it must be so, as there seems no other way of accounting for the intense depression. DeFabeck, F. W. A., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-Pathological indications do not appear to me to support this view :- 1st.-There is no proof that secretion is suppressed from want of nervous force, but much to show that this condition is due to the deficiency of the circulating fluid from which that secretion is derived. 2nd.-Post mortem examination shows, that the larger blood-vessels supplying the lungs, the liver, and generally all parts of the system, are distended with accumulated blood, while the capillaries are almost empty ; there, therefore, appears to be reason to conclude that there exists a spasmic condition of the muscular fibres of the minor arteries and veins, which form the connexion between the main trunks and the capillaries, and that hence arises an exalted, rather than a diminished, activity of the vascular branches of the ganglionic nerves. 3rd.-It is more probable that the excited condition of the sensory-motor nerves, which produces the cramps usually complained of by cholera patients, should be reciprocated by the sympathetic system, than that this latter should assume a state of paralysis. This view seems to be strengthened by the following considerations- (a).-Vomitting is one of the urgent symptoms of cholera. A necessary condition for the production of vomitting is obstruction at the pylorus. In this disease there can be no other cause for such obstruction, than spasmodic contraction of the muscular fibres of the lower third of the stomach. (b).-The pain and uneasiness felt in the epigastric and pericordial regions can only, as far as I know, be satisfactorily accounted for by this increased contraction of the stomach, and probably also of the diaphragm. (c).-The intestinal canal is almost entirely dependent, for its nervous supply, on the sympathetic. If this supply were arrested, as it would be in paralysis, we should have this depression and the interrupted discharge of bile into the intestines operating as powerful causes to produce constipation. Thus there is nothing to show that the peristaltic action of the intestines is any way impaired, and if it be granted that there is no positive proof to indicate that action is exalted, there is none to establish that it is not as free as at any period during health. 4th.-If cholera were associated with a paralysed condition of the sympathetic system of nerves, injury, or impairment of function of this system under other conditions, would produce results similar to those observed in cholera ; but this, it is well known, is very far from being the case. I should, therefore, rather say that the primary action of the choleraic influence is to exalt the action of the whole or portions of the sympathetic system of nerves (notably their ganglionic branches distributed throughout the vascular system), producing a condition of spasm of the muscular fibres of the smaller arterial branches, of the ductus communis chole- dochus and of the ureters, and that in consequence of this, circulation is impeded and secre- tion and excretion impaired. Donaldson, J., Surgeon, Mad. I.--The suppression is owing, I think, also to failure of the supply of healthy blood, the circulation partaking of the depression, and labouring on in a much impeded or almost suspended state.

Duckworth, F., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-There can be no doubt that the shock to the nervous system is very great, and that the depression exerts a paralyzing effect on the sym- pathetic and ganglionic nerves, which may have a decided influence in diminishing or suppress- ing glandular secretions ; but the state of inertia of the secreting organs can also  be satis- factorily accounted for by the stagnation and engorgement of the glands, and perhaps, also, by the peculiarity of the action of the poison on the constituents of the blood and secreting cells. Eteson, A., Surgeon, Ben. I.-I apprehend there is great obscurity, not only as regards the precise functions of the sympathetic nerves, but chiefly because, admitting the suspension of the sensitive powers, it is not yet shown whether such an effect is due to loss of nervous power, primarily or coincidently. Undoubtedly, the organs chiefly affected are those supplied by the sympathetic nerves, but who can say that these results are due to "paralysis" or "depression," except in so far as it may be surmised that the chemical balance of the blood being deranged, the nerve centres are not susceptible to its influence. Farquhar, T., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Or what is perhaps more likely, causes a state of tonic spasm of the nervous system in part ; at least, this is the most likely action. Fraser, A. H, Surgeon, Ben. B.-I am inclined to believe that it is the secondary in- fluence, such as urmic poisoning, and the mal-nutrition of nerve centres from change in the blood, which paralyses by the morbid action set up by the primary effect. Furnell, M. C., Surgeon, Mad. I.-It would seem so. One often sees a man, looking as if about to be attacked by cholera when cholera is prevalent, shake off his malaise by drinking a good stiff tumbler of any stimulant, such as brandy and water. Gibbons, J., Surgeon, Mad. B.-Yes, and also the great nervous centre. Greenhow, H. ?., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Primarily, the poison depresses the ganglionic nervous system, and suppresses the action of organs supplied by it. Jackson, J. R., Surgeon, Ben. I.-The action of cholera poison is of the nature of a ferment in the blood, and if the blood or the fermentable material of the blood can be charged with the sulphites,, it is to be reasonably expected that the poison may be counteract- ed in its lethal effects. Jardine, J., Surgeon, Ben. B.-These are very early symptoms of the poison, but I suspect that the poison of the blood is as early, if not antecedent, to the shock of the nervous system. This possibility should not be omitted in future experiments and enquiry. Lidderdale, R., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-The poison in its primary action seems to depress the organic nervous system, in some cases proving fatal with little vomitting and purging, acting so powerfully through the sympathetic as to destroy the action of the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys, and so to cause death. Lowe, T., Surgeon, Mad. I.-My opinion is that the primary action of the poison is upon the blood ; then, that paralysis of the great ganglia and sympathetic ensues, and that this paralysis causes the suppression of the various glandular secretions. McDowall, C., Surgeon, Bom. I.-It remains to be discovered whether or not the cholera poison being absorbed into the blood and acting on the sympathetic (chiefly vaso-motor nerves), primarily causes embarrassment (by spasm?) in the circulation, and arrest of secre- tion, absorption, and depuration, and then, only as a consequence to this, exudation of water, &c., through the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane, which exudation by thickening the blood also further prevents the heart, kidneys, liver, &c., from acting, and helps collapse. The alternative lies in considering whether this, the cholera poison, acts primarily (by simple contact, or most probably after circulating in the blood) on the mucous membrane of the stomach and bowels as an irritant, and by simply draining the watery and saline portions of the blood, thus and thus only prevents circulation, secretion, depuration and absorption. 2.     In accordance with the first view, the true remedy  to   he sought is  one  which  will counteract the depression  and spasm (?) of the circulating and depurating organs, and enable absorption to take place, without our caring too much for the loss by the  bowels.    It is easy to propose many  such   remedies :   subcutaneous   injection of morphia as a stimulant  and re- mover of spasm, atropine, calabar been, hyoscyamus, &c., &c., with diuretics and chologogues. Until a remedy suited to the  case  be found,  we  are logical in  cautiously moderating the almost certainly fatal loss of fluid, and thus, and more directly by stimulating chologogues, diuretics  and aromatics enabling the circulating and depurating organs   to   act.     I have often wished to give an  extended trial to turpentine  as being an astringent to the bowels, and at the same time a diuretic. 3.     As our knowledge of the poison, its mode of absorption, its situation, whether in the general circulation or merely on  the  surface of the mucous membrane of the stomach and bowels, its peculiar field of action, whether the cardiac pulmonary on solar plexuses, or merely the periphery of these last, the surface of mucous membranes, or  any particular organs, as our knowledge of this, and   of the   different states  of the poison in its germ-stage  or fully developed stage, increases, the above conclusions may have to be modified ; but these are the true subjects for long and careful study.
54                       REPLIES TO QUERIES ON THE TREATMENT OP EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.      [Appendix Query No. 9,-continued. Mackenzie, M. M., Surgeon, Bom. I.-Although feeling well at the time, while stooping over the death bed of a poor European woman suffering from cholera at Sattara, I was suddenly seized with abdominal pains and desire to go to stool. Before I got home (300 yards), these symptoms had increased and vomitting had set in, but by judicious measures the symptoms were arrested. MacLeod, A. C., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-I cannot concur in the opinion that this is a primary action of the cholera poison. A remarkable depression of the whole nervous system does indeed take place, by which the vitality of the secreting organs h proportionately lowered ; but I conceive that this depression of the nervous system is itself a secondary effect, consequent on the blood poisoning which precedes. The secreting powers of the liver and kidneys are thus influenced by the state of the nervous system. But the blood is at the same time poisoned, no longer furnishing that pabulum on which the secreting powers can he exerted with advantage. This may well be another cause, co-operating with that of diminished nerve stimulus, in producing arrest of secretion. I believe that in cholera the blood is poisoned (only through the medium of the lungs), much in the same way that it is poisoned by the venom of a serpent. Indeed, if we consider one of those rarer and worst cases of cholera, in which the victim is suddenly stricken and as rapidly sinks, without either purging or cramps, the analogy is not a little striking, and may be instructive. There is the same sudden prostration of the powers of life, with faintness, sickness, giddiness ; the same stupor (without delirium, lethargy, and indifference), vomiting, coldness of surface, clammy perspiration, livid hue, faltering pulse, and viscid tarry blood correspond- ing to the surface coldness, there is the same sense of internal heat indicative of that uni- versal visceral congestion which, in both cases alike, death reveals ; lastly, the same suspen- sion of the hepatic and renal functions. The pathological phenomena then of an attack of cholera (according to my views), may be summarized as follows, in their order of succession : - In the first place, when the lungs have no longer the power of restoring, presumably by neutralization, the poison of cholera, that poison produces, through the lungs, a three-fold and simultaneous effect, namely, insufficient oxygnation, loss of temperature, and great nervous depression. The patient feels suddenly faint and giddy ; the skin becomes deadly cold, clammy, and wrinkled ; with an universal leaden tinge, especially of the lips and conjunctiva ; the breath issues cold from the mouth : the tongue too is cold, and of the same general leaden hue. If a vein or artery be opened, even at this early stage, the blood trickles slowly, thick and dark, and the pulse is scarcely to be felt. The shock to the whole nervous system is visibly of the most intense character. Next in order succeed the proper or pathognomonic symptoms, in consequence of the presence of venous blood in the arteries, and of loss of power in the nervous, and especially the ganglionic system ; the secreting powers of all the glandular organs, including the liver, kidneys, and salivary glands are arrested, and there is no bile and no urine ; and the tongue "cleaves to the roof of the mouth."                                                                                               Whilst the surface and extremities are cold and bloodless, the viscera become hot and gorged with blood, and all the heat remaining and all the blood are rallied to the strongholds of the body ; they are wanted there for present life, for the death struggle at hand, and for re- action. The patient, whilst his very nails are blue with cold, complains of intolerable heat, especially about the epigastrium. With a failing circulation, irregular muscular action is a familiar physiological effect ; hence cramps are excited. By another familiar law of the econo- my, the suppression of one or more secretions is compensated for by an increase of others ; accordingly, there are, lastly, frequent and copious dejections of a thin serous fluid, partly by stool, and partly from the stomach by vomitting, and at the same time the skin is bedewed with a cold sweat. Morton, G. ?., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-The effect of the poison is certainly to diminish or suppress the secretions, probably through the ganglionic nerves. Muuro, W., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. ?.-I have thought so since 1862. The fol- lowing is an extract from my report of cholera in the 93rd Highlanders :-" How heat, or dif- ferent degrees of heat, and moisture act so as to produce disease, I do not know ; whether by the production of malaria poisonous to human life, or by direct influence on the nervous system, I cannot understand."

I.-The only point which has occurred to me is, whether the paralysis of the ganglionic system, caused by the action of the choleraic poison, is not of itself sufficient to affect the life of the blood, and cause changes in its constitution without supposing that the poison actually enters the blood. In cases of death from light- ning, the life of the blood is at once destroyed, and its constitution altered by the deadly

Orr, J. H., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. I.-The entire train of the symptoms of cholera sufficiently proves the correctness of these views. Peterkin, J., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-The primary action of the poison seems to be on the blood, and secondly on the sympathetic and ganglionic nerves ; by their paralysis re-action is stopped in the various secreting organs. Probably the copious sweat and cold surface are due to this condition of the minute twigs of this system ramifying on the coats of the vessels, failing to maintain their tonic power, and thus admitting of the transmission of the serous fluid by exosmosis, which, in health, is kept in control by this part of the nervous system. Reade, W., Surgeon, Mad. B.-Generally admitted. In some cases the intensity of the poison is such as to destroy life in a very short space of time. Rennick, H. H., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. I.-Unquestionably the worst forms of the disease I have met with were those in which the sufferers, without any warning whatever, were struck down as if asphyxiated. Ross, J. T. C., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-This theory in the present state of the knowledge on the subject is as good as any other. Sainter, J. D., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. B.-I have seen cases in the jungly districts of Bengal, in which there were no stages of the disease at all. Collapse set in at once, and a fatal result ensued within two hours in cases of this kind. Of course all treatment is hope- less, as the system is in a state of paralysis. I have tried the hot baths in such cases, but I am sorry to say with only partial success. Saunders, G., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-This question again presupposes the operation of a poison, and of this there is no proof whatever. The most important and the most constant symptom in cholera is the arrest of secretion, which would lead one to imagine an arrest of all healthy nervous vitality-but might not this state be induced in other ways than the one supposed ? Since diarrha, not choleraic, will either induce rapid death or cause a complete pros- tration of the vital powers, is it not, therefore, as philosophic to assume that a great and sudden development of the proximate causes which end in diarrha, may of itself induce all the symptoms collectively which we call cholera, as to rely on the existence of a specific and a special agent of which we know nothing. I by no means wish it to be inferred, that I believe cholera and diarrha to be identica), I simply wish to point out that as much may be gained by enquiry in the direction of common causes acting concurrently, as in the more vague, but always more attractive, one of special and specific influence. Again, will nothing but paraly- sis of the sympathetic arrest secretions ? Is it impossible that sudden and severe internal con- gestions (even of the ganglionic system), may be induced by ordinary or perhaps extraordinary climatic or mtorologie changes, and would it not be possible for these to lead to that state of the system which implies the advent of cholera ? Sexton, E., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-May not the separation of the fluid from the solid constituents of the blood be also owing to paralysis of the sympathetic system; and may not the arrest of the secretion be also attributed to this impaired enervation ? Simpson, D.,  Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-To counteract the poison no antidote is known. We must, therefore, modify its influences on the organic nerve-centre by nervine stimulants, and keep the skin and kidney acting as the principal emunctories, as diminution of ervo force retards elimination and favors the accumulation of the poison. Shelton, A., Suryeon Major, Mad. B.-The primary action of the poison is, I apprehend, displayed on the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines, thence on the blood ; and the blood being disorganized, no longer has power to fill the organs which are supplied by it for the performance of their respective normal functions. Smith, H. S., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-Recent French experiments tend to show that deprivation of nerve power causes immense serous secretion into a selected portion of the in- testines, whilst the system is under the influence of certain poisons such as strychnia. Stewart, L. W., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-This is, and has been, my theory for the last fifteen years. Style, M., Officiating Deputy Inspector General, Bom. I.-I think the theory good, Spencer, R., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. B.-I think the poison is as a preliminary absorbed into the blood, and acts secondly on the nervous system, causing depression and diminishing or suppressing the secretions of organs. Summers, J., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. B.-This I believe to be the truest theory ; and it explains the absence of the secretions generally, and the failing of the circulation. - Sylvester, J. H., Surgeon, Bom, I,-I believe that cholera is entirely an affection of the sympathetie system. 15
56                       REPLIES TO QUERIES ON THE TREATMENT OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.     [Appendix Query No. 9,-continued. Thorp, E. C., Surgeon, Ben. I.-I believe the origin of cholera to be a loss of the energy and temporary vitality of the sympathetic nervous system, or a morbid and exhausting irrita- bility of the same system. I have seen amongst natives two or more cases where the patient has been brought to the hospital in a state of syncope, not coma. The cases had neither diarrha nor vomitting or cramps, but the sunken hollow eyes and cheeks, and signs of im- perfect, if not suspended, aeration of blood were present, as in the most severe cases of ab- dominal cholera. Nothing removed the intensity of these manifestations, and the patients died. Thring, G. B., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I-This may be so, but it is not an esta- blished fact. If it is so, I do not think the poison could be eliminated by the secretions from the particular organs under the control of the sympathetic and ganglionic nerves. Tousdell, W. G., Surgeon Major, Bom. B.-Such is the correct idea. Tarner, J., Surgeon Major, Bom. I-Most certainly, nervous depression is primary. Van Someren, W. J., Surgeon Major, Mad: I.-When, in correspondence with this patho- logical observation, we strike upon some medicine specially operative, and perhaps stimulant, on these nerves, we may find treatment less empirical and more successful. Wilson, R., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-The primary action of cholera poison is to para- tyze the sympathetic and ganglionic nerves ; and as these preside over secretions, the secretory functions are suspended until this nervous system recovers its suspended action. Wood, D., Surgeon, Ben. B.-The diminution or suppression of the secretions is an evident fact ; but as to whether or not it be caused by the special action of the poison on the ganglionic and sympathetic system, I am not prepared to offer an opinion. I think the poison is swallowed. In certain states of the mucous membrane the germs increase rapidly ; in others, this is not the case, and the poison is thrown off after the primary action, which is eccentric and local. Young, H., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-I entirely concur in this opinion. IV.-FIRST   STAGE   OR   MALAISE. Query No. 1-Indications.-To eliminate the poison through the secretions of the liver, kidneys, and skin.-To avoid exhaustion or exposure. Ellis, W. J., Civil Surgeon, Humeerpore, Ben. I.-A convict, young, hale and hearty, came up to me one morning during an epidemic of cholera at Maunbhoom ; his countenance spoke alarm and anxiety, and he wished to be removed or transferred during the crisis. I tried to reassure him by telling him not to think of the matter and to attend to his task. Within 12 hours that man was no more. This no doubt was a case of fright or fear, and I Have known of other cases ; but this struck me at the time most forcibly. DcFabeck, F. W. A., Assistant Burgeon, Ben. I.-The disorder here introduced as the first stage of cholera, I cannot recognise as being cholera at all. There is a combination of two symptoms without which I consider there is no cholera, viz. (1st) rice-water evacuations, with (2nd) suppression of urine. All the other symptoms may, and do, occur under other conditions ; and conversely, were they all absent in a case presenting the combination of symptoms above mentioned, I should regard such a case as one of true cholera. That diarrha frequently merges into cholera, I cannot but admit ; but diarrha is no more cholera than a combination of one equivalent of chlorine with one of mercury is corrosive sublimate. Under this view, I treat cases of diarrha during cholera time very nearly as I would treat them at another ; combining of course such precautions as may be indicated to prevent their running on into cholera. But when once rice-water evacuations and suppression of urine occur, I change my treatment entirely, just as, to pursue the above simile, a chemist would change his treatment of a preparation of calomel to which another equivalent of chlorine had acci- dentally been added. Eteson,  A., Surgeon, Ben. I.-I have not seen any marked line which could divide this the first stage of cholera. During the occurrence of an epidemic I believe that every living soul within its influence must be infected : and all experienced medical men are familiar with a premonitory train of symptoms, which assumes greater or less severity according as the individual has in his system that which favors the development of the contagion or otherwise.                                                                                                                                   Fayrer, J., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Allay irritation, check purging, give calomel, grs. 10, opium gr. 1 ; some mild astringent for relaxation ; counter-irritation to the abdomen. Hunter, W, G., Surgeon, Bom. I.-I have not recognised this stage. I should call what is here described as the second "stage or the stage of choleraic diarrha the first stage ; though at the same time, I would observe that, the diarrha, though generally present, is not invari- ably so. McDermott, P. A., Surgeon, Bom. B.--None that I know of. I have given calomel, Dover's powder, and capsicum, with some success ; and phosphite of soda in good beef-tea at short intervals ; also a mixture of ale and gin to allay thirst, and promote the action of the kidneys.

Oldham, C. F., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-Good if possible. If the poison can be elimi- nated, the stomach and bowels appear to be the channels indicated by nature. But little success has followed any attempts to remove the poison through them ; and in the early stages, at all events, the disease appears often to be arrested by remedies which tend to check elimi- nation and to diminish the secretions such as the cholera pill. Anything tending to depress the vital powers is to be avoided. Playfair, G. R., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Since 1862, I have made the removal of con- gestion of the kidneys the very earliest part of my treatment of the first stage of cholera. J. think the results have been very good. Smith, C. M., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-I believe there is a period of incubation lasting from a few hours to three or four days. The first symptom of cholera is a kind of " malaise," with lassitude and depression of spirits, slight feverishness, and headache. This is followed by uncomfortable sensations in the epigastric region and bowels, and a tendency to diarrha; the stools become light-colored and watery, and the urine is high-colored and scanty. If these symptoms are neglected, or are not checked by medicine, they are soon followed by the congee-water stools of cholera. Thom, W., Deputy Inspector General, Bom. I.-Having seen a great deal of cholera during my service, I have long been of opinion that the proper mode of treatment is to support the strength of the patient, and not to check the vomitting and purging, which I believe to be the method adopted by nature for eliminating the poison from the body. In the few cases I have treated of late years, I have relied, upon external applications, with the use of cham- pagne, beef and chicken tea, with an occasional dose of aromatic spirits of ammonia, the patient being strictly watched day and night. The cases were not many, but 1 did not lose one of them. Walker, W., Surgeon., Ben. I.-I believe the poison of cholera, like that of typhus, will be eliminated by nature without our aid, and that we want some mode of treatment that will moderate the exodus and support the patient during the struggle. Williams, H. F., Surgeon, Ben. I.-These indications are, I consider, of the utmost importance in preventing the second stage. Query No. 5,-Spices and Carminatives are useful. Adley, W. H., Surgeon, Ben. I.-A combination of stimulants, astringents, and aromatics with opium, Gardner, E. B., Assistant Surgeon, Ben, I.-Opium also was never given, as I have known only evil follow its use. In former "epidemics, the treatment followed was always a stimula- ,ting and cumulative one ; warm stomachics, pills containing essential oil, assaftida, capsi- cum, and copious draughts of hot water. The body was enveloped in a large poultice of meal and mustard, and a fire was placed under the bed of each patient. Grant, W., Surgeon, Bom. B.-A circumstance came under my notice at Nusseerabad in 867, which, I think, deserves notice. Several men came to the camp hospital, complaining of looseness of the bowels, having to some extent a choleraic appearance, and a "crampy" feeling of the legs. It was observed, that when these men sat or lay down, this " crampy" feeling became more intense; and there seemed to be more general depression when they talked about the " crampy" feeling of the legs'. The depression seemed gradually to wear off. A system was adopted in such cases of giving small doses of brandy with opium and capsi cum at short intervals, making the men at the same time walk, backwards and forwards at a lively pace. In most of these instances the choleraic symptoms gradually disappeared. There seems to be some resemblance between this mode of treatment and that adopted some- times successfully in cases of blood poisoning caused by snake bite. McDermott, P. A., Surgeon, Bom. B.-Some stimulants must be given, and some anodynes and astringents also. Penny,  J. C., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-Native Hakeems have long used them : they say ginger will cure cholera, when used both locally and internally. Capsicum, nutmeg, &c., arc all useful adjuncts ; and camphor is good as a prophylactic, according to their ideas. Peterkin, J., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-I used to think so till I tried the system pro- posed by Dr. Ayre, of Hull, of giving small doses of calomel repeated at short intervals. I have a comparatively small experience of it. I view it, however, very much in the light of a specific, but unless his directions are most carefully and implicitly carried out, it is no better than any other remedy. In those cases under my supervision in which it failed, I felt inclined to attribute this, not to the remedy, but to want of due attention on the part of those who were charged with the duty of administering it. I do not think it applicable to the early stages, or to those cases in fact that in all probability would never end in cholera under any ordinary judicious treatment. I have never given it till the case assumed the " algide'' form, or possessed unmistakeably the features of true cholera.
58                      REPLIES TO QUERIES ON THE TREATMENT OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.     [Appendix Query No. 7.-Calomel is valuable when the stools are light-colored. Odoy Chund Dutt, Ben. I.-Calomel and opium, a glass of brandy, and covering up in bed. Payne, A., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-A dose of 5 grains of calomel. Query No. 8.-Quinine and bitter tonics are useful, especially in the rainy season. Cox, C, L., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I. -In wet damp weather I believe that quinine given as a prophylactic is of much value ; it is also very useful in cases of cholera which have assumed a remittent form. Hastings, T., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I--I am quite of opinion, that every- thing which improves the general health produces an increased power of resistance. When in 1S63, I had charge of the Artillery Division at Allahabad, the 77th Kegiment which was also at that station, in the months of June and July lost about 70 men, women, and children from cholera. At this time I made it a practice to give one dose of quinine daily to the Artillerymen, and caused the men to come to hospital on the least appearance of diarrha, and not one case of cholera occurred amongst them. Murray, T., Surgeon Major, Bom. I.-Quinine and bitter tonics are useful, especially in the rainy season. Roberts, E. J., Surgeon, Ben. I.-I have given quinine pills freely in 2 grain doses to a large number of coolies without any beneficial effect. The number of attacks was not diminished. Simpson, D., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-Quinine and bitter tonics of similar consti- tution, and strychnine, protect against malaria, and should be given morning and evening as prophylactics. It is very desirable also to check the diarrha. This is of paramount Im- portance towards the treatment and cure of the disease, in order to fortify the system so as to enable it to combat and overcome the morbific influence which is being exerted on the nervous centres and ganglia. The treatment of cholera by potent nervine tonics, I would submit, is not only a rational treatment of the disease, but it is in accordance with all that is known of the physiology and pathology of cholera. The remedy must be active, and should be administered in a soluble form, so that it may be rapidly incorporated with the system. A remedy of sufficient potency will be found, I believe, in the alkaloids, strychnia, and quina combined, and prescribed in solution. This should be administered as soon as the disease is ascertained to be cholera, and it should be repeated until a sensible effect upon the disease has been produced. If the remedy has been retained by the stomach, an in- terval of three hours should elapse before it is repeated. If the stomach is irritable and rejects it, it should be administered hypodermically.  Ward, T. W., Deputy Inspector General, Bom. I.-I have  seen quinine do much harm by inducing cerebral excitement and congestion. Query No. 9.-Purgatives, especially saline, are dangerous, and are apt to induce congee stools and collapse. Blacklock, A., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-No more dangerous at a cholera time than any other depressants. Clementson, F. L., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-Most dangerous. I have known them to cause fatal cholera when cholera was prevalent. Cooke, A. T. L., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-Dangerous, and frequently induce congee stools and collapse.                                                                                                                      Hadow, G. B., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Yes. Except castor-oil as exhibited by Dr. John>on of King's College Hospital. Query No. 10.-Change of air useful. Andrews, C. A., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-If there is a salubrious situation in the vicinity ; but a fatiguing journey would develope the disease, and increase the probability of a fatal issue, Griffith, H., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-Removal to even a very small distance from the spot at which the disease had been contracted, has, to my knowledge, changed the cha- raceter of the symptoms, and secured complete immunity from the epidemic. Rennick, R. H., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. I.-I cannot say I have found it so I recollect once when with a regiment  on the line of march sending away an officer whose child had died of cholera. He as well as his wife, and another child who  accompanied him, were all dead from the disease in 48 hours.

Ross, J., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-I believe the usefulness of this measure will be made more and more evident by further experience. Not only is the individual removed from the locality of the disease and thus given a chance of getting rid of it altogether, but the moral effect at such a time is immense. I am disposed to think that change of air at this stage might probably mitigate the seventy of the attack, or might possibly in some cases prevent it altogether. V.-SECOND  STAGE,  DIARRHA- CHOLERAIG  DIARRHA. Query No. 1.-Indications.   To check the looseness, remove irritating ingesta, soothe the irritation, and promote the secretions. Beatson, J. F., Officiating Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-Certainly check the loose- ness. My experience makes me prefer for this purpose gallic acid in combination with ginger and laudanum, or any carminative. As regards the removal of irritating ingesta, though the indication of vomitting is not without danger, I am convinced, from actual experience, that where there is good cause to suspect the presence in the stomach of undigested food, a mustard emetic is an excellent remedy to administer. It unloads the stomach, rouses the system, and favors the action of remedies. All of these are not accomplished by the vomit- ting of the rice-water fluid, however abundantly that may be taking place. This I have over and over again seen. I quote the following from my report of 1859 :-" The mere act of vomitting the rice-water, no matter in what quantity, does not empty the stomach of solid contents. Repeatedly, men who had vomitted copiously the characteristic fluid and nothing else, upon having a mustard emetic administered, threw up large squares of . meat, literally, just as they had swallowed it hours before, showing that this treatment, which at first was simply experimental, was both rational and useful." Bell, A., Surgeon, Ben. B.-This is most important. Nothing is more so, for if we succeed in checking the purging, the formidable after-symptoms seldom appear. Chalmers, G. B., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-Unquestionably in some cases a mild purgative with some carminative is found useful. Colles, J. A. P., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-The peculiar smell of choleraic discharges is a very valuable pathognomonic sign, and this is not enough dwelt on in books. I expect that the pathognomonic "choleraic smell" will be found in all cases of true choleraic diarrha, and not in the hill diarrha, or in that which occurs early in the cold season in the plains. In the spring of 1860, I observed this smell in cases of what at other times would have been regarded as diarrha. Within 24 hours such patients were, as I antici- pated, attacked with cholera. The epidemic kept possession of the station (Gonda in Oudh) for nearly a month. At Peshawur, in October and November, the occurrence of cold sweats, vomitting, purging, cold tongue and cramps, in the cold stage of malarious fevers, is not uncommon. As a rule, these choleroid symptoms attend the first attack of ague only, the subsequent paroxysms presenting nothing peculiar , nor is there any necessary connection between the occurrence of these symptoms and the severity of the hot stage. Some of the cases, which on the first occurrence of ague can hardly be distinguished from cholera, run a very mild course afterwards, and yield readily to treatment. Cullen, P., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-When I find the ailment is owing to an irregularity in diet, I try to get rid of the irritating ingesta by a rhubarb draught guarded by some carminative tincture. In such a case the patient is most likely cured without further treatment. But if I find that the person has become affected without any appreci- able cause, I at once commence with astringents and stimulants and more especially the latter. For knowing the course the disease will take if not checked, I try to ward off its debilitat- ing effects by using stimulants from the first, and by raising and keeping my patient up I endeavour to cut it short before it has a strong hold on him. For instance, if a man were just seized with purging and vomitting, I would give him an ounce of brandy in as much water, hot or cold ; and the effect of this in the early stage is generally to allay the vomitting for a time. I then give him some astringent mixture in small closes, such as 10 grains of gallic acid with an ordinary dose of dilute sulphuric acid, or an equal quantity of the aromatic sulphuric acid, in an ounce of plain or cinnamon water. Fleming, A., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Check the purging by cholera pills or tincture. Stop opium when vomitting and purging are arrested. Fogo, J. M. S., Surgeon Major, Ben. B.-In the first indication of the looseness, the remedy found most useful is acetate of lead and opium, either in the form of a pill or mixture. It will arrest many a case of cholera. When the looseness has been stopped by the one or two or three doses that may be required, the intestines should be cleansed by a dose of castor-oil with a few drops of Battley's solution of opium. Rest in the recumbent posture should be enjoined. Gibbons, J., Surgeon, Mad. B.-During every cholera epidemic, diarrha and looseness is more or less prevalent ; and it varies in degree from slight increase of the natural excretion to what is characterized as " choleraic diarrha." I believe this diarrha is often an actual manifestation, that the individual has been subjected to the cholera poison, or that 16

It is amenable to treatment, and we should endeavour to moderate it, with a view to prevent its becoming exhaustive, and by inducing debility, rendering the subject more liable to true choleraic seizure. This is the period in which carminatives, astringents, and various " cholera pills" prove useful, and during which " house to house visitation" should be undertaken. Macpherson, H. M., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-The indications are to check the looseness, soothe the irritation, and promote the secretions. When cholera prevails epidemically it is dangerous to administer castor-oil or other purgatives. Pilsher, J. G., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-To check the looseness is doubtless the indication. And this is often accomplished by a mild purgative combined with carmina- tives, which has the effect of clearing out the bowels. Many cases of undoubted cholera are apparently saved by this timely purgative. The passing of thin feculent discharges contain- ing semi-digested matter, specially calls for the use of gentle purgatives with stimulants or carminatives. Turton, F. A., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. B.-To check the looseness is the first step, and I believe it to be most readily attained by the use of iced cold water, as recommended by me. Query No. 2.-Remedies.-Opiates remove pain and check looseness, tout retain irritating ingesta and diminish the action of the liver. Adley, W. H., Surgeon, Ben. I.-A combination of nitrate of silver and calomel, with  1/4 grain of opium. McDowall, C., Surgeon, Bom. I.-Opium also checks the function of the kidneys, which is much more dangerous than stopping the bile flow; indeed, we see cases of jaundice last for weeks without coma following. The liver, however, in cholera may be induced, perhaps, to eliminate more than bile, and calomel also, I think, tends to eliminate urea, &c., in more ways than one. Opium, if given (and some miraculous cures sometimes follow a single dose), must be combined with or followed by calomel. Murphy, M. W., Deputy Inspector General, Bom. B.-Opiates are most essential. When combined with quinine or small quantities of blue pill they are unobjectionable. Spencer, R., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. B.-Of all remedies I consider opium the most useful for this stage ; and when the diarrha is checked, one or two small doses of calomel will probably restore the secretions of the liver. Townsend, 8. C., Surgeon, Ben. I.-It is by its stimulating effects on the nervous system that opium given in the early stage, so often proves efficacious in arresting the progress of the disease. But opium often fails to do this ; and on the other hand, it acts injuriously by its action on the secreting organs, preventing the elimination of the poison and aggravating the secondary fever. Query No. 3.-Chlorodyne is more energetic than opium with analogous action on the secretions-it stimulates the brain. Chapple, R. A., Surgeon, Bom. B.-I endeavour to check the diarrha which usually ushers in an attack of cholera. With this object, I have tried at different times all the vegetable and mineral astringents in use, and I have found that all yield in efficacy to chlorodyne. It possesses over other remedies of the class of astringents, either alone or when combined with opium, two great advantages ; these are, that it produces immediate effect on the system, and is tolerated by the most delicate stomach. It is only of value in the first stage. Barker, Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-Rum, 2 ounces, or brandy, with 20 drops of chlorodyne. Brougham, J. P., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Chloroform inhalation ; chloroform with sulphuric acid mixture ; chalk with Chloroform and ammonia. Browne, J., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Chalk mixture, with aromatic spirits of ammonia and chlorodyne ; a rhubarb draught if undigested food is passed. Chuckerbutty, S. C. G., Surgeon, Ben.

I.-Below is given a formula which I have found most safe and effectual in the preliminary treatment of cholera, for cutting short the disease, or at least making it apparently milder and more manageable in all its stages, and for warding off extreme collapse, and so obviating violent reaction.

Formula. Chloric ether, minims twenty to thirty. Aromatic spirit of ammonia, minims twenty to sixty. Dilute hydrocyanic acid, minims two. The usual vehicle for this dose was a little of the ordinary chalk mixture, which relieved the acidity and burning. If excessive looseness went on, a few doses of the solution of the muriate of morphia were added (minims 7 to 10 in each dose), and also tincture of catechu. These latter were added only to control and not to stop the purging. See Edinburgh Medical Journal for December 1868, or my pamphlet reprinted from this paper. Elliot, J., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Chlorodyne, or an astringent with laudanum ; mustard to the abdomen ; diluted sulphuric acid with laudanum or morphia ; soda and ginger. Finnemore, J. H., Surgeon, Mad. B.-A very much over-praised drug. It stupifies the patient, deranges the stomach, and masks the symptoms. Lowe, T., Surgeon, Mad. I.-I have had much experience of the action of chlorodyne, and I believe it to be a very valuable remedy. It stimulates the gauglionic system, and the glands under its influence begin to act in a normal manner. The secondary effect of chlorodyne is to act as an anodyne on the spinal system. Moore, W. J., Surgeon, Bom. I.-In the earlier stages, chlorodyne is, I think, invalua- ble. Chloroform administered as a vapour is, I think, deleterious, because its effect must be to produce cranial congestion. By the mouth it is beneficial, and I have frequently used it with marked success. I believe that chloroform acts as a general stimulant, and more- over exerts a local sedative action on the stomach and bowels. When cramps or griping are severe the external application of lint wetted with chloroform has appeared to afford relief. Price, A. G., Apothecary, Ben. I.-As cholera is in most cases preceded by an attack of diarrha, the treatment usually adopted is to check this symptom, and for this purpose a dose of chlorodyne often acts magically. Stewart, L. C., Deputy Inspector General, Bom. B.-I think chlorodyne most valuable, and would strongly advice its adoption in the British Pharmacopia, and that it should be supplied to all European Hospitals. Webber, Mr., Civil Surgeon, Dinagepore, Ben. I.-Grive a mixture as follows, in weak brandy and water, every quarter of an hour till purging is arrested; then lengthen the inter- vals : Tinet. cantharidis, 1 oz. ; ol. terebinth., liquor. ammon. a. a. 1/2 oz. ; spt. ammon. aromatic., drs. 2 ; chloroform., spirit. ther, nitr. a. a. drs. 3 ; spt. ther. sulph., ol. cajuput., ol. juniper., a. a. drs. 3 ; ol. anisi, dr. 1 ; brandy, oz. 8.

I.-Chlorodyne for Europeans. For Natives calomel and opium ; or, cholera pill of camphor, opium, assaftida, and long pepper. Query No. 6.__Astringents cheek the looseness, but retain the cause of the irritation, and do not restore the secretions. Cameron, J. M., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-Astringents, such as acetate of lead, chalk, catechu, and opium. DeRenzy, A. C. C., Surgeon, Ben. I.-In my opinion, the hypodermic method of ad- ministering drugs offers the only hope of success ; and I am disposed to think that a solu- tion of quinine In. tartaric acid, administered in this way, will be found useful. French, J. G., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. L-Astringents, opium, gr. 1 ; acet. plumb., grs. 2 ; sulph. zinc., grs. 2 ; camphor., grs. 2. Mix. To be taken every second hour. Gayer, E. J., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Zinc. sulph., grs. 15, in water; 1 oz. champagne; sinapisms ; stimulants in small quantities. Hendley, J., Surgeon, Ben. B.-True, but I think the looseness should be stopped if possible for some hours, and the cause of irritation afterwards removed by gentle enemata. Illingworth, J. A., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. B.-When persisted in after the charac- teristic stools and vomitting have been established, I have found them hurtful ; and patients treated with them were greatly distressed by jactitation, cramps, lasting collapse, and tedi- ous convalescence.
62                        REPLIES TO QUERIES ON THE TREATMENT OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.      [Appendix Query No. 6,-continued. Maclean, A., Surgeon, Bom. B.-I hardly know what to say about checking the looseness. Should this be attempted by astringents or by tonics? I should say the latter, at any  rate, at the commencement of the diarrha. By tonics I mean the remedies most powerful in maintaining and restoring strength, such as brandy, wine, extractum carnis, and warmth. MacLeod, A. C., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-Evidently contra-indicated. Like opium, they tend to lock up secretions, on the restoration of which life itself depends. Munro, W., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. B.-Yes, I am not at all convinced that in choleraic diarrha there is any visible cause of irritation, or at least that there is any irritating substance in the intestines. I have seen cases of choleraic diarrha in which there was no fear whatever. Summers, J., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. B.-Astringents have but very little power in choleraic diarrha ; frequently none in restraining discharge in true cholera. Wood, D., Surgeon, Ben. B.-They protract the symptoms and fail to cure. In some cases I have attributed hepatic abscess, which followed, in part to their administration. Acetate of lead and opium is perhaps an exception ; but it has failed to do after weeks what a succession of aperients has effected in a few days. Query No. 8.-The combination of carminatives and opiates removes the pain and checks the looseness without suspending the action of the liver, or affecting the brain. Clark, S., Surgeon, Ben. I.-The exact time during which the incubation of cholera takes place, is, as in many other diseases, a difficult question ; but according to my experience, the first dawn of the disease occurs between 2 and 3 A. M. I have almost invariably found that persons suffering from cholera state, that they felt restless sometime during the previous night, and had a copious evacuation in the early morning, after which they felt better, and slept quietly till about their usual time of getting up, when they were suddenly seized with uneasiness and an urgent desire to go to stool. Gray, R., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-Even combined with carminatives, opium to some extent interferes, in my opinion, with the action of the liver. Query No. 9.-Cholera pills are very valuable, convenient in form; they are composed of assaftida and opium with black and red pepper, and sometimes camphor. Baillie, N. B., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Ordinary cholera pill, acidulated drinks, abstinence from food and alcoholic drinks, frictions, sinapisms, hot bottles, bricks. Banister, G., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-I have always added camphor, believing it to be of great use. These pills are very convenient for distribution, and judging from the quantities I have known to be indented for by Native officials and Heads of villages, I conclude that the people have great confidence in them, and that they do a vast amount of good in the early stages of the disease. Barnett, 0., Surgeon, Bom. B.-Are very good, and most valuable, I believe, in arrest- ing premonitory diarrha. Beatson, J. F., Officiating Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-Perhaps so, as calcu- lated to give a feeling of confidence to many, and as being besides by their constitution suited to arrest the earlier symptoms of looseness. They cannot fail to be in some degree useful. I have seen chlorodyne cut short as by magic a diarrha which was unquestionably the first stage of cholera, and I entertain a high respect for its influence for good. If taken early, it seems to act as a highly restorative cordial, checking diarrha, diffusing warmth over the surface, and in a marked manner augmenting the force of the pulse. Chappell, J. J., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. B.-I have never known an European who could take more than one or two doses of the cholera pill. Natives of Bengal will take any number, and put great faith in them. I believe them to be only useful for natives at the commencement of the disease. Chalmers, C. B., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-Cholera pills are valuable, but they should be fresh and soft. As often seen they are as hard as shot, and if not masticated, prove inert, or, at all events, do not check the disease. Cockburn, R., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-These are very useful for general distribution during the prevalence of cholera, as they can be entrusted to non-professional persons for administration where medical aid cannot be readily obtained. Cooke, A. L. T., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-Cholera pills are valuable and convenient in form. Dr. Paterson's pills, with and without opium, are the best of the kind I have seen used. The former contain opium, calomel, acetate of lead, camphor, aromatic powder, and acetic acid. In the latter red pepper and canthurides powder are substituted for the opium.

I.-I have further tried what is commonly called the cholera pills, composed of camphor, black pepper, and asaftida, of each 1 grain, and of opium a quarter of a grain, made into pills with oil of peppermint. I have found them beneficial. They are stimulant and antispasmodic, and these actions are aided by the carminative and pungent properties of the peppermint and black pepper. When sending medicines to a distance, to be administered by non-professional hands, I prefer giving these pills, to giving those containing calomel and opium. Delpratt, S., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Pills of camphor, asaftida, and black pepper, with a small quantity of opium or nitrate of silver, camphor, and opium. Durant, J. J., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-I have employed them for years among natives, and they seem to answer well. I would add 2 grains of calomel to each pill as making them more certain in their action. Mliot, R. C., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. I.-Very convenient in form, and useful early in the disease. Furnell, M. C., Surgeon, Mad. I.-They seem very valuable when distributed in a district amongst poor people and are eagerly sought for. When Civil Surgeon of Cochin, thousands of pills were distributed in the district during a cholera epidemic, and they were eagerly asked for. Guise, J. A., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-These pills are perhaps the most useful, particularly where medicine has to be distributed amongst people at a distance from any medical officer. Hastings, T., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-I have often given these pills for circu- lation among the people during a cholera epidemic, and always with benefit. If taken early they arrest the flux in the majority of cases. Hendley, J., Surgeon, Ben. B.-They appear to be especially serviceable in the case of natives. I prefer the combination of asaftida, black pepper, and camphor, as a rule, without opium. Jackson, C. J., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Aromatic and astringent draught with opium ; or cholera pill of opium, asaftida, and long pepper. Joseph, J. M., Surgeon, Mad. I.-Pills composed of the drugs here mentioned are very useful, and should always be distributed in different localities where the outbreak of cholera is expected, or where cholera is existing. Kellie, J., Surgeon Major, Bom. B.-These pills, in combination with calomel, I have seen of great service. Kennedy, J., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. I.-The form is convenient, but the propor- tion of opium should be small. MacLeod, A. C., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-Cholera pills are very valuable and con- venient in form. They are composed of asaftida and opium, with black and red pepper, and sometimes camphor. Macpherson, H. M., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-Cholera pills containing asa- ftida, opium, black pepper, and camphor are most valuable and convenient in form ; their administration has, I believe, prevented many, and cured very many more cases of cholera. Menzies, E., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. B.-Cholera pills are decidedly useful, and camphor should always, in my opinion, form one ingredient. Morton, G. E., Deputy Inspector General, Ben, I.-I think so. Munro, W., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. B.-They are. Murray, J., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-Cholera pills are very useful and convenient, and should be composed of the substances here enumerated with the addition of acetate of lead. Murray, T., Surgeon Major, Bom. B.-This is found to be a very useful combination, and the pills were distributed freely during the last rains. Penny, J. C., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-Often produce the very best effects, and not the least so by the confidence which they inspire. Price, A. G., Apothecary, Ben. I.-The cholera pills, composed of camphor, opium, and asaftida, act much better on the native constitution than on the European. Every police station and tehseel ought to be provided with a liberal supply of cholera pills, and some stimulating astringent mixture, with plain instructions how to use them. Ross, J. T. C., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-I believe the best prophylactic medicine to be the old sedative, stimulant, and antispasmodic pill, of opium, black pepper, and asaftida. 17
64                      REPLIES TO QUERIES ON THE TREATMENT OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.      [ Appendix Query No. 9,-continued. Russell, C. M., Civil Surgeon, Gya, Ben. I.-One dose of chlorodyne, or ordinary cholera pills, opiate and ethereal effervescing draughts. I treat nearly every case with the follow- ing :-acid sulph. dilut., m. 20 ; spirit, ther. chlorici, m. 10; tinet. opii, m. 5; mist. camphor., 1 oz. Mix. Sainter, J. D., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. B.-I have seen them produce very beneficial results. Style, M., Offg. Deputy Inspector General, Bom. I.-Very valuable for indiscriminate distribution. Summers, J., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. B.-Are useful to be placed in a barrack room, to save time during removal of patients to hospital. Thring, R. S. 0., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Remedies administered with marked effect during an epidemic of one season appear inert in another, or are not attended with quite; the same beneficial results ; but in the case of asaftida a good result is always obtainable, provided the patient applies early for treatment. Turnbull, G. ?., Surgeon, Ben. ?.-In early stages of diarrha and exhaustion, useful. The pills should always contain camphor, and they should be kept in glass-stoppered bottles, Williams, H. F., Surgeon, Ben. I.-This is, I believe, Dr. Murray's formula, and I have found the pills very useful ; but the substitution of the extract of Indian hemp for opium is valuable, particularly in the first stage. The tendency, from the addition of this drug, is to the elevation of the spirits and the removal of depression. Williamson, W., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-I have used these pills, with calomel as one of the ingredients, and consider them valuable and convenient in form. Wilson, R., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-Cholera pills are portable, and can be sent with facility to a distance ; they do not deteriorate by keeping for a few months, and the combination is a valuable remedy in the early stage of cholera. Wise, J. F. N., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Astringents with diffusible stimulants ; cholera pill of asaftida, camphor, black pepper and opium. Chlorodyne is also useful. Query No. 10.-Calomel is powerful and valuable in restoring the secretions of the liver and kidneys when the looseness is checked. Aitken, W., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-When calomel has been given, as before indicated, 1 have seldom seen any benefit from its continuance. When a mercurial has been necessary subsequently, I have generally used blue pill or grey powder. I have generally found the secretions return with little or no further interference, except regulation of diet. Baillie, H., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Calomel grs. 10 alone or with 1 gr. opium, according to character of disease ; sinapisms to epigastrium and extremities. Barker, Civil Surgeon, Ben. I.-Calomel, grs. 3 ; opium, gr. 1/2 ; creosote, 1 drop ; to be given every 2 or 3 hours. Or acetic acid, drops 20; plumbi acet. gr. 4; camphor grs. 3 : rum 1 oz. ; water 1 oz. ; to be given every hour. Frictions, sinapisms, effervescing draughts. Bird, R., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Calomel and bicarbonate of soda, carbonate of ammonia, arrowroot with port-wine, small quantities of water frequently. Bose, Dr., Civil Surgeon, Ben. I.-Check the serous flux by calomel and opium, chalk and opium, lead or nitrate of silver and opium ; gin, iced water or soda water ; use frictions. The calomel treatment is best for the young and robust. Delpratt, S. Surgeon, Ben. I.-Calomel in large doses followed by nitrate of silver : diffusible stimuli ; solution of camphor and chloroform to nostrils ; chloroform 40 drops when vomitting is excessive. Donaldson, J., Surgeon, Mad. I.-I look upon calomel during the disease simply as " poison ; and it is seldom if ever required to restore the secretions after the disease is overcome. Duckworth, F., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-Calomel is unquestionably a valuable remedy in re-establishing the processes of secretion and excretion. But the extent to which it should be given, both as regards each single dose and its quantity collectively, in any particular case, should be well considered, and its immediate effect carefully watched, in order that its use may not be prolonged so as to render the patient liable to any evil effects during the period of re-action, when he begins to rally and when the absorption becomes active and rapid. In my experience of this remedy given alone, I have seen the best effects produced in many cases ; but in some, the remedy unfortunately remained inert or showed its effects only in its cumulative action on the system so soon as the patient began to rally, and caused much mischief. All the symptoms of mercurialism were produced, attended with profuse salivation and sloughing of the palate, cheeks, and gums, and even causing the loss of one or more of the teeth. A few cases also proved fatal from this cause. The ulte- rior effects of calomel on the system ought always to be borne in mind.

I.-Calomel ten grains ; and two or three doses each of five grains at intervals of an hour. Iced acetic acid and water. Chloroform and oil for cramps. Jackson, J. R., Surgeon, Ben. I.-I have tried a variety of remedies, but I may briefly state that I have most faith in one or two large sedative doses of calomel, with a very small proportion of opium. Irving, J., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-It must, however, be honestly confessed, that when the remedy has been freely given and absorbed, I have seen patients who seem to be the worse for it after a time ; and when they died, it was a question whether they had died of the disease or the remedy. I am still inclined, however, to continue to use calomel and opium, or calomel with bicarbonate of soda at first, because I know of no better plan of treatment. I give ice and iced water freely. Kirkpatrick, J., Surgeon Major, Mad, I.-It is difficult to summarize the experience which one may have had in the treatment of cholera. What seemed to have done good in one case or in one epidemic, has been useless in another. On the whole, I have as much faith in calomel and opium in large doses at first, and smaller ones with aromatics and camphor afterwards, as in any other treatment. During the purging and collapse stages, I also think the employment of sulphuric acid with aromatics deserves some reliance ; but on the whole, the result of treatment has been so unsatisfactory that I would be ready to try any other proposed line of treatment that offered a prospect of better success. Judging from the remarkable effect of tea enemata in one case, I mean to try it again on the next oppor- tunity. McDowall, C., Surgeon, Bom. I.-Yes, and even in earlier stages. Mantell, A.  A., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Calomel and opium every 2 or 3 hours; calomel 3 to 1 gr., opium 1/4 to 1/2  gr. Rennick, R. H., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. I.-At one time I had a high opinion of calomel, but subsequent experience lessened my faith in it. During the late epidemic at Kamptee a medical officer used it in small repeated doses, accompanied by diffusible stimuli with success, only 15 out of 70 thus treated having died. Smith, D. B., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Ipecacuanha in large doses is sometimes worthy of a trial. Opium with caution. Calomel. Wise, J. F. N., Surgeon, Ben. I.-In sporadic cases. Stevens' saline treatment; when epidemic, calomel grs. 40, followed by 10 or 20 grain doses, with or without soda, every hour or two. Acetic acid and chlorodyne are of use in certain cases. Query No. 11.-Sulphuric acid in some cases appears to act beneficially ; vinegar and acid drinks are useful. Andrews, C. A., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-This I regard as the most useful remedy known in choleraic diarrha. Baillie, N. B., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Diluted sulphuric acid and opium, abstinence from solid food, recumbent position. Brake, J., Surgeon, Ben. I.-The acid, however, I believe to be chiefly useful in the diarrha so often prevalent at the same time. Persons with irritation of the intestinal canal are prone to contract the more serious disease, and this is one great reason amongst others for "topping the so-called diarrha. At the onset it is often exceedingly difficult, if not impos- sible, to say whether a particular case is one of simple diarrha only, or cholera in its first stage. Coates, J. M., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Sulphuric acid, lead, and opium, brandy and chloro- dyne, no drinks. Grant, W., Surgeon, Bom. B.-It does, especially in combination with quinine and opium. Greene, A., Civil Surgeon, Ben. I.-Acetic acid m. 10, in water 1 oz. ; to be taken every 1/2 hour. Blisters to the epigastrium, and hot bottles to extremities. Hunter, G. Y., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-Sulphuric acid combined with rectified spirits in form of elixir helleri, and given with ether, has appeared beneficial, and especi- ally where burning thirst is complained of. Hutchinson, R. F., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Has much confidence in the vinegar treatment 1/2 oz. every 1/2 hour. Miles, H. C., Surgeon, Bom. B.-Sulphuric acid, and dilute sulphuric acid in conjunction with opium in solution, is in the widest sense beneficial.
66                      REPLIES  TO QUERIES ON THE TREATMENT OF  EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.     [ Appendix Query No. 11,-continued. Murphy, M. W., Deputy Inspector General, Bom. B-Sulphuric acid and opium I have found most useful in checking the diarrha in cholera epidemics. I prefer it to any other form of medicine at that period. Russell, C. M., Civil Surgeon, Ben. I.-Sulphuric acid mixture, cold water at short intervals, frictions with warm flannel, ice internally, mustard plaster to epigastrium. Stewart, L. W., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-Sulphuric acid does in some cases act very beneficially, both in this stage and collapse. I give it in large doses after the emetic has acted, Turton, F. A., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. B.-Acts beneficially after purging and vomitting, more especially with quinine dissolved in it. Query No. 12.-Acetate of lead with, opium checks the looseness and retains ingesta : it does not restore the action of the liver. Allen, J. B., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Acetate of lead, 5 grs. ; dilute acetic acid, 5 drops ; tinc- ture of opium, 20 drops; water, 11/2 oz. To be repeated after each motion. Baillie, H., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Calomel gr. 1, sugar of lead grs. 4, opium gr. 1, after every second large loose motion. Hot arrowroot, with a little brandy or port wine. Chalmers, C. B., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-G am not sure of this effect of lead and opium in cholera ; and I have often observed, that where the purging was at first frequent and copious, recovery was more frequent, and I would not prescribe these remedies early in the disease. Chevers, N., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Tannic acid grs. 5 to 10 after each stool ; sinap- isms, or liquor lytt to scrobiculus cordis for vomitting; chloric ether m. 20. To be given from every 1/2 of an hour to 2 hours, according to pulse and heat of skin. Frictions with mustard. Chuckerbutty, S. G. G., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Mustard plaster. Acetate of lead, grains 5 ; dilute acetic acid, drops 5 ; distilled water, one ounce. Mix. To be taken every hour. Or chalk mixture, or tannic acid grs. 10 every hour; ice or cold water; arrowroot or sago. Guise, J. A., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-I have often seen these medicines given in combination, but have never seen any decided benefit result from their use. The real pro- gress of the disease is unchecked by the sugar of lead and opium. Martin, W. T., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. B.-Much used by me both by mouth und rectum. The most successful means of checking obstinate diarrha. Query No. 13.-Sinapisms to the epigastrium are valuable, especially when vomitting appears. Playfair, G. R., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-I may here add, that amongst large bodies of men, when the patients are numerous, instead of mustard and red pepper, I use, first, equal parts of atta and red pepper, a mixture much more economical and equally efficacious ; and second, a stimulant with opium and red pepper in a tumblerful (10 or 12 ok) of as hot water as the patient can swallow. Query No. 14.-Enemata, hot saline, are sometimes most beneficial, but occasionally powerless. Banister, G., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-My opinion regarding hot saline enemata is, that their beneficial effect is wholly dependent on the amount of warmth they impart. Miles, N. L,, Surgeon, Bom. B.-Occasionally powerless, but always worthy of pro- longed trial.                                                                                                                              O'Kearny F. R., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-In the algide stages, I have found it beneficial, but the enemata are not readily retained. Orr, J. H., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. I.-I have tried the remedy but have always found that the re-action established, when any re-action did occur, was only temporary. Simpson, D., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-The use of hot saline enemata has not been attended with great success. Saline injections into the veins should accomplish the same object more expeditiously and more certainly. Sinclair, E. M., Surgeon Mad. B. -Very useful during cholera. Here (Kamptee), in this year, enemata of salt and water have been very successful.     Stewart, L.   C., Deputy Inspector General, Bom. B.-Most true, as may be said of all remedial measures.   I have used the saline enemata frequently, but without decided results.

Hot saline enemata frequently produce tem- porary relief and re-action in the collapse stage ; but I do not know that they are particularly valuable. Query No. 15. Bleeding is not generally followed by benefit, and sometimes by collapse. Browne, J., Surgeon, Ben. I.- I do not approve of bleeding, generally speaking, in any stage. I have seen patients bled in the third stage (collapse) ; and I consider that in this stage bleeding is to be considered as a test of the severity of the disease, rather than as a therapeutic agent. That is to say, in those cases where a vein was opened and the blood came freely, recovery generally resulted ; but in those cases where the blood was so thick ( owing to the loss of its watery portion), that none would come from the opened vein, death generally took place. In the stage of re-action, blood is frequently required to be taken by cupping, or leeching, in order to subdue inflammation, or local congestion. Gray, R., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-Small bleeding in two or three cases seemed to be beneficial ; and for a short time, the circulation was, or seemed to be, carried on more vigorously. Griffith, H., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-I have applied leeches to the loins in eight cases, with a view to relieve existing congestion of the kidney, but there was nothing which I could perceive afterwards to show that it acted in any way beneficially, as all of these cases terminated fatally. Plank, C., Surgeon, Ben. I.-I have practised the method of small bleeding with a view to re-establish the circulation, and have seen it practised by Dr. Playfair, who intro- duced it. The result was not encouraging. Reynolds, J. A., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. I.-I have seen bleeding tried in this country many years ago, in some cases repeatedly. All terminated fatally. Sinclair, E. M., Surgeon, Mad. B.-I have tried this plan when the right side of the heart seemed much oppressed, by taking one or two ounces of blood. No success followed. Style, M., Offg. Deputy Inspector General, Bom. I.-The benefit of bleeding is very doubt- ful. I once bled in succession four cases all of which died. This was at Baroda. Three months after, at Bombay, I bled in three cases, and all of these proved fatal. I believe that bleed- ing is only of use to obviate congestion on the setting in of re-action. Trestrail, J. C., Surgeon Major, Bom. I.-I bled at one time very largely, and I have seen wonderful recoveries after it. Diffusible stimulants must be given immediately after, and must be continued. Ward, T. W., Deputy Inspector General, Bom. I.-I have seen bleeding cure a patient when there was evidence of congestion of the lungs. Young, H., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-Bleeding I have seen adopted in many cases without benefit. Query No. 16."Warm baths and wet sheets are sometimes useful, and not likely to be injurious.   Cold affusion is sometimes useful. Fasson, T. H., Surgeon Major, Mad. B.-To supply warmth to the body is the direction in which, I think, we can, in the stage of collapse, do most good ; and the most effectual means of doing this I have found to be to envelop the patient up to his neck in a hot wet blanket, wrung out as dry as practicable, and then to cover him over with hot dry blankets. Griffith, H., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-I have found most marked benefit following after a warm air bath, and it is far superior in its effects to the warm water bath. It seems to have all the stimulating effects of the latter without its relaxing qualities. Jackson, J. M., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. I.-Warm salt baths always restore the circulation. Whilst the patient is in the bath colour returns in the lips, and the patient converses sensibly, but he falls back into the collapse when taken out. Joynt, F. G., Surgeon, Bom. I.-The cases were generally brought in the state of collapse, and the cold affusion was tried with great success. A mussuck of cold water poured rapidly over the face and trunk of the patient as he lay on the ground, usually roused him to sit up and endeavor to resist the operation. He was now quickly dried and rolled in a blanket with a view to induce diaphoresis. If he asked for water to drink he was allowed to have some. In a large proportion of cases (about 80 per cent.), sound sleep was induced, the desired re-action established, and recovery took place. 18
68                       REPLIES TO QUERIES ON THE TREATMENT OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.      [ Appendix Query No. 17.-Purgatives and antimonial medicines are apt to induce congee stools and collapse. Brake, J., Surgeon, Ben. I.-The castor-oil, or eliminative treatment, I have seen tried in many cases in India, but without sufficiently favorable results to satisfy me as to its superiority ; and the same may be said of the saline treatment. Cullen, J., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-Dr. Johnson's plan of treatment by castor-oil is on the principle of similia similibus curantur. I have generally found that the oil could not be retained, and only served to increase the sickness, which it is the practitioner s first and chief object to allay. MacLeod, A. C., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-From this I dissent. In the choleraic diarrha I regard the deficiency of the biliary function as the proximate cause of the diarrha. The irritation (inflammation) of the intestines is due to a two-fold cause ; firstly, to the absence of bile in the duodenum, and secondly, to the presence of the uncombined elements of bile in the blood ; as there is urmic poisoning in cases of anuria so there is cholmic poisoning in cases of acholea. Choleraic diarrha is a result of cholmic poison- ing. Cholera itself is a result of cholmic and urmic poisoning together, a combination unparalleled in any other disease, and to which unparalleled combination as a proximate cause the intensity of the objective symptoms of cholera are due. Moreover, though, for the sake of perspicuity, I speak of the presence of a "cholera poison" in the blood, and of the necessity for its elimination, it would probably be more correct to speak of the results of that poisoning, namely, of bile and urine retained in the blood and of the necessity for their elimination. Should it be objected that there is no trace of bile or urine in the cholera evacuations, it is sufficient to observe, that it is the uncombined elements of bile and urine that are thus eliminated, and that these bear no necessary resemblance to bile and urine respectively. Choleraic diarrha then being due to cholmic poisoning, it is to be regarded as an effort on the part of nature to eliminate that poison from the blood. By the administra- tion of a purgative we favor that intention. All purgatives are chologogues, some more than others. By the selection therefore of a suitable purgative we fulfil two indications together,-the purification of the blood, and the renewal of the biliary function. I say " renewal," but in choleraic diarrha, it may be simply diminished, or only altered. In cholera it is wholly suspended. I have always found a purgative, oil, or rhubarb with magnesia, or the ordinary senna draught, an unfailing remedy. Those who combine opium with such medicines, with some vague idea of moderating their effects, will sometimes achieve success, in spite of the combi- nations. For an intelligent patient who does not consider calomel poison, and in the absence of special idiosyncrasy, I prefer in India, ten grains of this drug given alone. It acts firstly- and almost instantaneously, as a direct sedative, as is shown by the subsidence of griping pains, and the enjoyment by the patient of a sound sleep. The diarrha is at the same time checked. Supposing the calomel taken at bed-time towards morning we may expect two or three copious feculent stools passed with scarcely any pain or uneasiness. The first stool is generally dark olive, almost black, owing to the presence of cystic bile, or bile that has been for some time retained in the gall bladder; passing through shades of green and bright yellow, the stools will at length arrive at the natural color of health. At the same time the artificial diarrha that has superseded that of the disease, will gradually cease and recovery will be complete. Shelton, A., Surgeon Major, Mad. B.-I have witnessed instances of rapidly fatal cholera when the disease already existed around, arising from over-fatigue, exhaustion, with perhaps drink, and exposure to the sun or to heavy rain. The first case of cholera in Her Majesty's 48th Regiment at Lucknow in 1861 occurred in a man who had been lying out at night in wet clothes, who had been drinking, and who had been much exhausted by walking from the city to his barracks, some four miles distant. VI.-THIRD STAGE-COLLAPSE. Query No. 1.-Indications.   To relieve urgent symptoms, supply warmth, and avoid strong remedies, and watch for re-action. Beatson, J. F., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-I entirely concur. And I cannot imagine experience having two voices here, though the means employed may he as various us the opinions of men regarding their relative value. Coates, J. M., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Calomel, soda, and ginger combined to be given, or muriatic and hy drocyanic acid with tinet hyoseyami ; injections of lead and. opium. Egg beaten up with an aromatic water ; mustard to epigastrium ; hot sand to body and extremities ; avoid fric- tions and much opium. Delpratt, S., Surgeon, Ben.

B.-Medicines or internal remedies are of no avail now. Warmth should be supplied in some artificial way. French, J. G., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I. -Frictions, embrocations, no medicines. Haward, H., Surgeon, Ben. B.-The great object is to maintain warmth of the surface and the action of the heart. Joynt, F. G., Surgeon, Bom. I-During an epidemic I found the cold douche most useful in inducing re-action ; taking care afterwards to dry the surface, and to use friction, and warm blankets. Kidd, ?. ?., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-The symptoms in these cases were, vomitting and one or two rice-water evacuations, speedily followed by sunken eyes, cold and bluish tongue, cold perspiration, husky voice, cold breath, slow respiration, great prostration of strength, and restlessness followed by death. Some died in one hour from the attack, others in 5 or 6 hours, a few in 24 hours. Those who got over 36 hours generally recovered, but a few died as many as 20 days after from exhaustion. Maclean, A., Surgeon, Bom. I.-I have found castor-oil inunctions all over the body ; using some degree of smart friction, flannel bandages to hands and feet, hot water bottles to hands, feet and sides, and English blankets useful. In the case in particular of a man of the 72nd before Sebastopol, apparently hopeless, Surgeon Major Mackinnon, C. B., adopted this castor-oil inunction treatment, at my suggestion, and he can speak as to its effect in this case. Any of the ordinary oils or grease might have answered, but I prefer the castor- oil as being the most consistent and adhesive. The principles of this treatment are these ;-there being a fearful loss of temperature, this, if possible, ought to be increased without delay, but as this cannot be done by any internal remedies, absorption being at a stand still, or nearly so, the only other plan is by the application to the dried general surface of some slow conducting matter to cause the retention and accumulation of what- ever amount of heat is being produced in the system. And as castor-oil, flannels, and English blankets are good slow conductors, these are used, and have been found often and often to lead to a rapid increase of temperature and pulse and always to remove the cramps. Martin, T. E. P., Surgeon, Bom. I.-I think, until the disease is better understood and the nature of the poison and its mode of action demonstrated, the treatment must necessarily be usually empirical. People have recovered after all modes of treatment, and. have escaped without any treatment at all. But still, small as is the scientific hold we have upon the disease, the cry of society for help is sharp and imperative, and something must be done. Experience teaches that it is consistent with our present knowledge to follow the line of treatment generally indicated in these questions. It also teaches, that a patient and enlightened use of means is often followed by signal benefit in many cases of cholera. Menzies, R., Surgeon, Ben. B.-This is a stage in which little can be safely done beyond endeavoring to restore the heat of the body, and to wait patiently for re-action. Munro, W., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. B.-Yes. Cases in which collapse took place without premonitory diarrha and vomitting were generally of short duration and always ended fatally. The sufferers became blue before death. Murphy, M. W., Deputy Inspector General, Bom. B.-I would endeavor to support the strength of the patient as much as possible by nutrients ; and T would attend to cleanliness, ventilation of the apartment, and careful and proper nursing. The recovery of the patient from the collapsed stage depends, according to my views of the disease, on the power of the patient himself to throw off the poison, or in other words, on the amount of the cholera poison in his system. Orr, J. H., Deputy Inspector General. Mad. I.-The indications here enumerated are most useful. Rice, W. R., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Here I have no faith in remedies. I should endeavor to treat the symptoms ; namely, to rouse the depressed vital energies, to allay the distress- ing vomitting, and to alleviate the painful and exhausting cramps. The watery purging I should let alone. I should put the patient into bed, cover him up well, apply a strong liniment to the abdomen, composed of capsicum pods steeped in mustard oil, with liquor ammoni, and oil of turpentine ; and I should have the extremities rubbed with the same. in the meantime I should give occasionally small saline effervescing draughts with aromatic spirits of ammonia or a little brandy, as cold as they can be made. If ice were at hand, I should have a small piece kept in the mouth, and allowed gradually to dissolve. I should hope by these means to allay the distressing and exhausting vomitting, and to contribute something of help to the attempts at re-action which nature makes. Mild nourishment should be continued. Large draughts of liquids should not be allowed. Smith, C. M., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Yes, I believe this ; support strength, avoid all strong remedies, and leave the rest to nature. Wright, T. P., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Nothing to be done but to give stimulants, and to use hot fomentations, and turpentine stupes.
70                      REPLIES TO QUERIES ON THE TREATMENT OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.     [ Appendix Query No. 2.-Remedies for burning thirst are cold or iced water frequently repeated, with the occasional addition of ammonia and soda. Banister, G., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-The piteous cries of sufferers for liquids to appease their burning thirst, and the sense of heat at the epigastrium, have naturally suggested the use of ice, and it has to my knowledge been most indiscriminately prescribed. I do not, however, despite the transient relief it affords, think that the practice is theoreti- cally rational or suitable to the stage of collapse ; nay more, I am of opinion that, by lowering animal heat, it is mischievous if not absolutely injurious. That it is temporarily refreshing there is no question, but as it can be shown to have an evil tendency, it would be wise to withhold it, or to give it most sparingly. I would do no more than moisten the mouth, and would prefer bland fluids such as linseed tea, gum and water, barley water, &c., given as hot as could be tolerated. Barclay, A., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. B.-Give lumps of ice frequently, or small draughts of iced water. I have found small draughts of iced water, with  tincture of lavender and aromatic spirits of ammonia, most grateful to the patient ; or chloric ether may also be added with benefit. Barker, Civil Surgeon, Ben. I.-Carb, ammonia, 3 grs., rum, 1/2 oz., water, 1/2 oz., every hour ; sometimes chloroform, ether, and aromatic spirit of ammonia ; frictions ; hot bottles to feet. Beatson, J. F., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-Iced water is perhaps of all the most grateful ; and when weakly acidulated it is much to be commended. Also infusion of tamarinds with small doses of the nitrate or supernitrate of potash added. Browne, J., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Relieve thirst with iced water, solid ice in mouth,  cold water with ammonia or soda, and effervescing draughts.    I do not think the patient relishes acid draughts.     I consider sodawater, with 10 or 15 grains of bicarbonate of soda to each bottle, to be a most beneficial and grateful drink.    Considering that  the collapse is due to the loss of   the watery portion of the blood, I have always allowed patients to drink water or sodawater.   as mentioned above, freely, in the hopes that the water might be taken up by the blood by the non-vital process of endosmose.    I have never seen that water (the patient as a rule always asks for cold water), given thus freely, has increased the vomitting, or has made the patient worse in any way.    In 1866, in the Fort at Allahabad,   during a short but pretty sharp outbreak of cholera, I have given fluid as I have described.     And in one case of cholera, an apparently hopeless case, and in some cases of choleraic diarrha, I measured the quantity of  fluid given as drink with the quantity vomitted afterwards (a proceeding which can be carried out with fair accuracy), and I found, that in the cases of  choleraic diarrha  (all of  these recovered), some quantity of fluid was absorbed between the time of drinking,   and   the  act  of   vomitting,   and   re-action gradually   set   in,   while the thirst became very much  diminished.     In  the   case  of  cholera,   the   patient  was  in  profound collapse for some   five   hours,   during   which   time   in   addition   to   a   bottle of   cham- pagne,    he   drank either 31  or  33   bottles  of sodawater ;   and the first  cause  we  had to   hope   for   improvement   in   this   case was, when the quantity of fluid  vomitted was less than that given as a drink, thus proving that absorption was going on.    This man recover- ed.    Another fact I observed during this cholera  outbreak  in 1866 was, that the severity of the stage of re-action is in the inverse ratio to the severity of the stage of  collapse, or of the cold stage, and this rule is found to hold good, I believe, with regard to fevers generally.    On the  day on which this apparently hopeless   case of  cholera   was   admitted,   there were some three or four men admitted suffering from choleraic diarrha.    In the case   of the man   with cholera, and who was most severely collapsed, the re-action was exceedingly  slight, while  in the cases of choleraic diarrha, the stage of re-action was excessive, and mostly complicated with hepatic congestion ;   the  man   who  recovered  from   cholera  was   at   his  duty  for   a considerable   time  before the  men who   were admitted   into   the   hospital   with  choleraic diarrha. Browne, J., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Dry cup over the loins. Sinapisms. Diffusible stimulants given in effervescence ; citrate of potash draught. Cameron, J. M., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-Small quantities of stimulants well diluted. Drinks acidulated with acetic acid. Warmth and frictions. Chalmers, C. B., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-Pounded ice in small quanities ; avoid overloading the stomach with cold drinks. Chappell, J. J., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. B.-Very good. Also a small lump of ice given to suck. Dilute sulphuric acid and water forms a grateful beverage.                                                                                                                       Chevers, N., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Continue the treatment. ; rub with ginger and flan- nels, apply hot bottles, shampoo the loins, do not rub them. Give chloroform mixture fre- quently, ice constantly, or iced water in tablespoonsful. Dwsarkanuth, C., Sub-Asst. Surgeon, Ben. I.-Diffusible stimulants, ether and ammonia, weak brandy and water with care, plenty of iced water ; use friction ; sago, port-wine and broths for food.

I.-Diffusible stimuli ; champagne, ether, ammonia, brandy; frictions ; extractive matters of flesh in solution ; rouse the heart's action ; prevent pulmonary and renal congestion. Fleming, A., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Discontinue opiates ; give weak hot spirits with hoc sago, or arrowroot, or beef tea. Fogo, J. M. S., Surgeon Major, Ben. B.-Iced water is most grateful, it should be given in very small quantities and often. A small piece of American or solid ice put into the mouth has been found to relieve the pain of the intense thirst, as well as to relieve vomit- ting, and there is the advantage, that as the water melts it finds its way into the stomach in only small quantities. Gayer, E. J., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Ice or iced water, inhalation of vapour of carbonate of ammonia. Greene, A. J., Civil Surgeon, Ben. I.-Same as in the fully developed stage. Acetic acid m. 10, in Avater 1 oz. every 1/2 hour ; blisters to the epigastrium ; hot bottles to extremities. Griffith, H., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-At this period of the disease, iced water in my hands proved invaluable as a remedy in relieving the intense heat felt at the epigas- trium, and in partially stopping the incessant thirst. It arrests vomitting so long as it con- tinues cold in the stomach, and the frequent repetition of it in combination with aromatic spirit of ammonia contributes greatly to excite re-action. Hadaway, J. M., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. B.-Pieces of ice, when to be had, put into the mouth. Coolest common or soda-water ad libitum. Avoid stimulants, Hastings, T., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-I think the use of iced water alone an admirable remedy for the intense thirst. If retained and absorbed it serves also to restore the lost water from the blood. IIulchinson, R. F., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Continue the vinegar ; give arrowroot with brandy. Jackson, C. J., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Ice or cold water, concentrated soups, ammonia and brandy in small quantities ; chloroform or sulphuric ether for cramps ; frictions. Never allow the patient to be raised. Jardine, J., Staff Surgeon, Ben. B.-Morsels of ice sucked and swallowed are always very grateful to the patient. Beef or chicken tea, weak infusion of tea, &c., and water acidulated with dilute sulphuric acid. Keals, W., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-I think small pieces of ice frequently placed in the mouth arc of most benefit in urgent thirst ; a mustard poultice to th epigas- trium and effervescing fluids in small quantities, and champagne iced, I have seen useful. Kendall, H., Surgeon Major, Ben, B.-Most beneficial and grateful to the patient. Kennedy, J., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. I.-I believe the means stated to be those best suited to allay burning thirst. Kirkpatrick, J., Surgeon Major, Bom. I.-Cold water seems the most relished of all drinks. It should be given very frequently, but not in unstinted quantities, otherwise it sometimes re-excites the vomitting. McDowall, C, Surgeon, Bom. I.-Yes ; and cold douche gives great feeling of refreshment. Macpherson, H. M., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-Cold iced water may be freely sup- plied at all stages, with the occasional addition of ammonia and soda. Mantell,  ?. ?., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Stimulants every 1/2 hour; champagne; frictions, with mustard oil or stimulating liniments; water freely. Morion, E. G., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-Yes. Munro, W., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. B.-Iced or soda-water with carbonato of ammonia. Murray, J., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-Cold or iced water, or soda-water or lemonade allay the thirst better than anything else. Whatever liquid is used, it should be given in small quantities at a time. O'Kearny, F. R., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-Very much so. Fresh lime-juice or diluted acetic acid added to cold iced water and sweetened has been found useful, and this is greatly raved for by patients. Payne, A., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Iced water ; stimulant of brandy or spaikling wine, if the pulse fail. For cramps, frictions with oil and chloroform, and hypodermic injections of morphia. 19
72                        REPLIES TO QUERIES ON THE TREATMENT OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.     [ Appendix Query No. 2,-continued. Plank, C., Surgeon, Ben. I.-In collapse, the cry of the patient in most cases is for water. ? have given it without stint, and I have seen many cases where this great thirst, assuaged by copious draughts of water vomitted again and again till the floor about the bed was wet with water, was the precursor to a favorable termination of the disease. Reade, J. B. C., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Most satisfactory remedies. Roberts, W. H., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-To relieve the terrible burning thirst noth- ing is so grateful as little pieces of ice put into the mouth, or small sips of iced water with ammonia and soda may be given ; but ice or iced water supersedes everything. Russell, C. M., Civil Surgeon, Ben. I.-Stimulating mixtures of ether, ammonia and brandy ; mustard plaster over the heart ; hot animal broth, salted and peppered, and containing chlorate of potash. Simpson, D., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-Cold or iced water supplies to the blood its watery constituents which have been removed by the diarrha, and favours the elimination of urea and of other morbid products by the kidneys. I think it should be given often and not in too large quantities. I have seen shock and collapse rapidly supervene on a large draught of champagne and iced soda water. Spencer, R.. Assistant Surgeon, Bom. B.-Water pure and cold ad libitum, and pieces of ice in the mouth to suck are I think sufficient. Stewart, S. C., Deputy Inspector General of Hospitals, Bom. B.-Small pieces of ice to be given to allay the awful thirst. I have found no benefit from forbidding indulgence in copious graughts of cold water. Ice or iced water is always grateful, and it is usually craved for. I give it ad libitum. I have taken it myself with unspeakable relief. The burning thirst is the most agonizing of all the symptoms. Turton, F. ?., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. B.-Nothing by the mouth. Van Someren, W. J., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-I would add, let these cold drinks be given in small quantities. Iced champagne is often well borne, and is very grateful. Wakefield, H., Surgeon, Bom. I.-Yes ; effervescing draughts with carbonate of ammonia are drunk at times with avidity. Ward, T. W., Deputy Inspector General, Bom. I.-Most useful. Waters, J. M., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. B.-Pure water, ice to suck, and soda water should be allowed ad libitum. Query No. 3.- Vomitting. Sinapisms or blisters to the epigastrium-hot turpentine fomenta- tion-iced water.   Large doses of calomel; of hydrocyanic acid.   Vomitting gives relief and acts as a stimulant in the most intense forms of cholera. Allen, J. B., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Hyposulphite of soda and rum mixture every hour or half hour ; hypodermic injections ; or hyposulphite of soda 25 grs. to 1 oz. of water. Barnard, G., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Granting that cholera is an inflammation, so far as we are practically concerned, of the mucous membrane lining these viscera, and that there is great need of a remedy which shall act speedily and efficaciously upon the inflamed tissue, no remedy is so likely to suit our purpose as antimony. Antimony is the remedy always relied upon, and most justly so, for other acute inflammations, specially of mucous membranes, in which calomel is not considered so fit, or rapid enough in its action. I met with one case of cholera last month. I found a syce lying on the floor of his stable, at 4 P. M., vomitting and purging incessantly a thin, watery, colourless fluid, with cold extre- mities, cramps, minute pulse, &c. He had one grain of tartarized antimony given him every quarter of an hour, three times ; ho vomitted after the first and after the second dose, but not after the third. Thus, in half an hour the vomitting was completely checked. About three hours after this, he was taken to hospital in a very great state of prostration, but perspiring freely, and there was no purging. He had ammonia and brandy and water given him at intervals, and he gradually recovered. Ho passed urine at 5 P. M. on the next day for the first time for six and thirty hours. He had no other medicine, and was discharged well on the third day. Antimony should not be given in the preliminary stage of diarrha, if there is such a stage ; I do not propose it as a remedy for diarrha,-we have one, a sufficient and thoroughly good and reliant one, namely, opium. Cooke. A. L. T., Surgeon, Mad. I.-Sinapisms are excellent remedial agents. A sheet wrung out in cold water and applied to the epigastrium gives great relief, and this often checks the vomitting. Give iced water ad lilitum. Francis, C. R., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-No opium ; water freely ; calomel  drachm 1/2 every hour, at intervals of 2 or 3 hours till bile appears-if necessary, up to grs. 300 ; tinct. cantharidis m. 5, with a warm stimulant mixture to be given at intervals with the calomel- if required up to 2 drachms of the tincture, Mortality in this stage, under this treatment, less than 30 per cent.

W., Surgeon Major, Bom. I.-Neither, in my opinion, relieves vomitting. The application of ice to the pit of the stomach is useful to allay vomitting. Joseph, J. M., Surgeon, Mad. I.-Suck has been my experience of these remedies. Louce, T., Surgeon, Mad. I.-I believe sinapisms are good, but not blisters. Turpentine fomentations I believe are also very good, especially to the loins and liver. Mustard emetics I have found beneficial in this stage. MacLeod, A. C., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-The results obtained by rubbing with cajeput oil, not only in relieving the dreadful cramps, but in rousing the powers of life, are truly astonishing. It is rapidly absorbed, and its odour appears in the breath, the urine,, and, presumably, in all the fluids, as I have observed in colic, rheumatism, neuralgia, &c. I have seen an infant suffering from cholera, and seemingly moribund, rapidly revive, and micturate (to my great surprise) under its use. I must here content myself with the expression of my opinion, that hand rubbing, as I have described it, is the most important part of the treatment of cholera, and one that should never be omitted, whatever other medicines may or may not be employed. Morton, E. G., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-T consider that the absorbents have lost all power in the stage of complete collapse, and that any thing short of a corrosive poison re- mains inert in the stomach and bowels until reaction takes place. When this does take place, stimulants begin to act, and are of course injurious. Sainter, J. D., Assialant. Surgeon, Bom. B.-Most valuable remedies, in fact indispensable. Saunders, G., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-The treatment which I have for years adopted consists of warm clothing and stimulants, with calomel in large stimulating doses. Slewart, L. C., Deputy Inspector General, Bom. B.-I have seen them do good; but too often in this stage they are powerless, and you might as well apply them to a dead body. I have found hot meal and water remain in the stomach when nothing else was retained. Van Someren, W. J., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-To these means, all of which are good, I would add chloroform, as sometimes efficient in controlling vomitting. Wakefield, H., Surgeon, Bom. I.-Are very beneficial and are relished by the patient. Query No. 4.-Congee-stools.-These give relief till reaction comes on and the colour of the evacuations changes ; hot saline enemata are sometimes useful. Andrews, C. A., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. T.-In favourable cases, the congee-stools con- tinue till reaction sets in. They are an indication of remaining vital power. If they cease early in the stage of collapse the prognosis is unfavorable. I think they must be useful. Chevers, N., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-I do not think that abundant congee-stools give relief. I believe that all needful evacuation has occurred previous to the setting in of rice- water purging and vomitting, which I always endeavour to check by tannic acid. Clementson, F. L., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-The passing of the stools gives relief from the sense of distension ; but whether any other effect is produced I cannot say. This I can answer for from my personal experience. I have had no experience in the use of hot saline enemata. Fogo, J. M. S., Surgeon Major, Ben. B.-It is remarkable how much relief these seem to give. I have had no experience of saline enemata. Illingworth, J. A., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. B.-Patients with free purging I noticed were much less distressed and made much better recoveries than where it was scanty. I have never used saline injections ; I have used largely starch and warm water, and found it most effectual. McDermott, P. A., Surgeon, Bom. B.-Hot saline enemata with turpentine and tincture of assaftida are very beneficial. McDowall, C., Surgeon, Bom. I.-Congee-stools only relieve the feeling of distension ; they fatally thicken the blood by draining it and rendering it unfit to circulate. If long continued purging voided largely the poison, then stopping the preliminaiy diarrha would universally prove fatal. But this is not the case. Rapidly fatal cases without purging and vomitting would only show the enormous quantity or extra violence of the poison. In congee stools the poison is in the state of germ, as starch is the germ of alcohol. It is only after fermentation out of the body that the stools become poison. Menzies, R., Surgeon, Ben. B.-I believe that the stools are the result of an effort on the part of nature to eliminate the poison, and that they do give relief. I have never tried saline enemata. Morton, E., Surgeon, Bom. I-The most serious cases are those where there is little vomitting and purging. I have not used hot saline enemata.

H., Deputy Inspector General, Had. I.-They give relief by assisting to eliminate the poison from the system. I have always accounted it an unfavorable sign when the purging entirely ceases. During the stage of collapse saline enemata have only a temporary effect. Pelly, S. M., Deputy Inspector General, Bom. I.-Judging from my own sensations while suffering from an attack, the relief is very temporary. Wakefield, H., Surgeon, Bom. I.-The congee stools are not so much the cause of uneasi- ness as the poison itself. They certainly do give relief, and it is at this time that my reme- dies would be directed towards causing a healthy action of the organs. The evacuation of alvine discharges is one of the most prominent symptoms of cholera, but I am inclined to think that the great prostration in collapse is due more to the poison itself than to the loss of fluid. In common diarrha it is the reverse. Query No. 5.-Cramps. Frictions with turpentine or dry ginger-hot bottles-hot  saline enemata-chloroform. Banister, G., Surgeon Major, Ben. I,-The cramps are theoretically attributed to the stoppage of the capillary circulation, by which the muscles are deprived of recently oxidized blood and therefore contract. But as the rigidity is usually confined to the lower extremities, and even to particular muscles, it is difficult to believe that a general cause should affect only one locality ; and moreover, it might be fairly inferred, if this were the true and only explana- tion, that spasm would pass progressively into persistent rigidity in proportion to the degree of collapse, which however is not the case. I have observed in many patients, not subjects of cholera, that cramps of a violent character have been induced by irritation of the mucous membrane of the bowels, from the presence of tapeworm or of masses of undigested matter ; and in one instance a patient of mine invariably suffered in this way just before the natural relief of the bowels. I inclino therefore to the opinion that in cholera the accumulated fluid is the source of the irritation, and that the connection between the sympathetic and spinal nerves indicates the cours through which the reflex nervous action travels. It is familiar to all that there is a marked cessation of spasms after a terrible expulsion of the accumulated fluid. Blacklock, ?., Surgeon, Major, Mad. I.--All bad. It is better to apply diachylon bandage to the feet, legs, hands and fore-arms, splints and tourniquets to the thighs, and pressure with the hands on other parts. Brown, J. C., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-Native champooers should be employed under an European who should not himself champoo ; he should have a glass of grog when coming on duty. Culder, W. M, Surgeon, Bom. B.-I was however led to believe, during a slight epidemic which occurred at Secundra, that strychnine, which I employed for the first time in cholera in the cases which occurred at that time, seemed in some to exercise an undoubted influence in controling the cramps which form so painful a feature in the disease, although the relief afforded was not permanent in all the cases. The drug was administered at first in doses of 1/10th to 1/8th of a grain, and repeated every half hour until 1/2 grain was taken. It was afterwards given more frequently and until one grain was administered, beyond which it as not pushed. If called upon again to deal with cholera I would not hesitate to exhibit this drug. Daly, G. II., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Cramps arc relieved by frictions with turpentine and dry ginger, hot bottles or bricks, and the inhalation of chloroform. I have often seen a single inhalation followed by perfect relief from cramps, and good refreshing sleep ; and I cannot record a single instance where the inhalation of the drug was attended with any dangerous symptoms. Joynt, F. G., Surgeon, Bom. I.-In a few cases extract of Indian hemp and calomel gave marked and speedy relief. Irving, J, Surgeon Major, Ben I.-All through the course of the disease it seems very desirable to administer the juice of raw beef, or iced beef-tea in small quantities, and at fre- quent intervals. In the stage of collapse, I am inclined to throw aside physic and trust to \ill\-tea or other kinds of nourishment, with stimulants in small quantities. Query No 6.-Feeble action of heart. Transfusion of saline fluid restores the action of the heart and colour, but only for a short time. Hot saline enemata are sometimos useful. Alcohol is powerless as a stimulant during this stage, and it is injurious in the following. Banister, G., Surgeon. Major, Ben. I.- Aleohol is useless. The remarkably encouraging effect of the transfusion of warm fluid into the veins suggests the belief that if it could be continued, recovery from collapse would be certain. The explanation appears to be, that the temporary improvement is due to the temperature of the fluids restoring for a brief period

Under circumstances of great difficulty, for there was no suitable apparatus at hand, I have injected into the circulation large quantities of weak saline fluids heated to 100 F., with no other than a transient improvement, and often not even that. Again, before profound collapse, I have injected from four to six ounces of spirits of wine and water heated to 100 F., and I have repeated it several times at short intervals without any appre- ciable effects. In one instance, however, the patient, a native woman, became at once maniacally delirious; she started up in bed with glittering eyes, and after violent struggles, sank down exhausted. She ultimately recovered but was attacked during re-action with double pneumonia, and after this warning I made no further trial. I remarked that the effects were hardly noticeable in Europeans, while all the natives were excited to a greater or less degree. Perhaps the brain tissue of the one was less accus- tomed to such a stimulus than that of the other class, and responded to it in the case I have alluded to, with wild exaltation of function. I did not attempt the injection of alcohol during deep collapse, believing that its oxidation could not possibly take place while the capillary circulation was entirely arrested. Carter, II. V.., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-Despite the transient effects of transfusion, there are grounds for more fully trying the operation in a complete manner. Do not give alcohol. Callen, P., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-For a short time I followed Dr. Honigberger's suggestion on his theory of a cholera mite in the blood, and I cut my patients and rubbed them with quassia, but only to see them die without the least apparent benefit. Fasson, S. IL, Surgeon Major, Mad. B.-I have found the functions of the kidney restored to action best by counter-irritation over the loins in the form of mustard sinapisms or blisters. When relieved from its state of congestion, the organ returns to its duty. Greenhow, H. M., Surgeon, Ben. I.-For feeble action of the heart, the best remedy is bleeding, repeated several times. Spirits are worse than useless in this as well as in the following stages. Hadaway, J. M., Inspector General, Mad. B.-The effect of transfusion is quite evanes- cent. I have seen camphor in powder given with the same object. The action of the heart and the color in the face were restored, but only for a few seconds, leaving the patient if anything more debilitated. Hunter, W. G., Surgeon, Bom. I.-I never saw any benefit from saline transfusion. Alcohol is, I believe, powerless. Joseph, J. M., Surgeon, Mad. I.-In thirty-one cases where transfusion of saline fluid into the veins was practised by me in the year 1848, the action of the heart was immediately restored in a very remarkable manner. The pulse returned to the extremities after the third or fourth stroke of the piston ; the cholera voice began in a short time to change into a more natural tone ; the body hegan to get warm, and the whole aspect of the patient soon changed for the better. But these improvements were of short duration, and the effects lasted only for a period varying from 30 to 50 minutes. Twenty-nine cases proved fatal and two recovered. I did not attribute these recoveries to the transfusion. MacLeod, A. C., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-I regret that my experience does not afford any information respecting the effects of transfusion. I cannot agree that alcohol is powerless as a stimulant. Used at intervals, I think it a valuable remedy, especially in extreme collapse. Even when discharged by vomitting, a little is probably retained, which finds its way into the fluids and acts as a stimulant. The spontaneous rising of the action of the heart is indeed the most welcome of all indications ; at the same time, I hope I shall not be thought paradoxical in asserting that even this might, by artificial means, be brought about too soon. On this point I venture to quote from my work on Acholie Diseases, page 178 :-" It only remains to be noted in addition that even the stagnation of the circulation, whilst the work of elimination is going on, is another indispensable element of the defensive process. So long as any of that subtle poison pervades the blood, this cannot flow too slowly ; the more quickly it passes through the parts it supplies, the more, it is evident, must they be subjected to the injurious influence it contains. The machinery of life cannot go on beneficially till this be expelled. It is therefore all but suspended, and carried on at the lowest possible rate compatible with life." The "stagnation of circulation;"  the universal congestion of the viscera ; the heat and blood of the body all drawn from the surface to the interior ; the suspension of all glandular secretions, hepatic, renal, pancreatic and salivary ; the subsequent watery evacuations ; these and all the "symptoms" of cholera I regard as but parts of a great functional convulsion for the ejectment of a poison whose presence is incompatible with life, and by this view of the pathology of the disease I am influenced in the. treatment. Miles, H. L., Surgeon, Bom. B.-Alcohol is not only powerless, but pernicious, in this stage. Mills, J., Surgeon Major, Bom. I.-The only stimulants I have found of much use in this stage are ammonia and ether, and specially the formula 10 grains, of the sesquicarbonate repeated every 15 or 20 minutes with camphor. 20
76                      REPLIES TO QUERIES ON THE TREATMENT OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.     [ Appendix Query No. 6,-continued. Morton, E., Surgeon, Bom. I.-I am not in a position to offer an opinion. Alcohol is all but powerless as a stimulant. Young, H., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-I have seen temporary benefit from transfusion of saline fluids, as well as from enemata. DeTatham, H., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-I have seen the most marked effects from transfusion of saline fluid, the pulse at the wrist returning, and in one instance the patient turning round on his bed and speaking, although he had previously been quite collapsed. But although these effects were very striking, in one case that I saw injected at the London Hospital and in two that I injected myself at St. Mary's, the patients all afterwards relapsed and died. I believe alcohol to be powerless in this stage. Wilson, R., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-I have no personal experience of transfusion of saline fluid into the veins in cholera. Hot saline enemata have the same temporary action. Alcohol I believe to be almost powerless, and if administered in any quantity it may produce grave complications when re-action becomes established. Query No. 7.-Sinking or dead feeling in the epigastrium (due to paralysis of the sympathe- tic nerve?).   Infusion of chillies or red pepper, camphor, ammonia, aromatic spices useful in small quantities.   Brandy, chlorddyne, ether have little action in collapse and are dangerous on re-action. Kennedy, J., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. I.-Probably paralysis of the sympathetic nerve. These remedies are likely to be useful, and cannot be injurious. Stewart, L. W., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-All the symptoms of this disease I consider may be traced to paralysis of the sympathetic and ganglionic nerves. In some cases very strong spiced tinctures (chillies and brandy) have brought about re-action. Query No. 8.-Quinine in small doses before the hour of exacerbation is often useful in aiding re-action and warding off the recurrence of sinking. Blacklock, A., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-Yes; where cholera and the miasm of intermittent fever are mixed in a subject who has previously experienced malarious poisoning. Felly, S. M., Deputy Inspector General, Bom. I.-I have sometimes given quinine in large doses (10 grains to a scruple), repeated a second time at an interval of one hour, with benefit. Smith, C. M., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-I witnessed a remarkable epidemic of this kind in 1845 at Chinsurah in the European barracks. Ticehurst, W. D. T., Surgeon, Bom. I.-I found this treatment beneficial during the pre- valence of cholera in the monsoon, while serving in the Mhow Jungles in 1858. Williams, H. F., Surgeon, Ben. I.-I have always combined it with strychnine, with ap- parent benefit, but mostly so after re-action, and in convalescence. I am led to attribute most "benefit to the strychnine.                             _________ Query No. 9.-Belladonna, quassia, chlorate of potash, sulphuric acid, strychnine, acetate of lead and opium, hot water, air baths, and small bleeding are said by some to be useful. Hypodermic injections, tartar emetic, mustard emetic, have been used. Bustead, W. J., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-I have tried chlorate of potash, Condy's fluid, and quinine in large doses, but the effect has been doubtful. Harrison, J. B., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-In 1861, at Meean Meer, I tried as a last resource, with an European female, subcutaneous injection of quassia; and certainly the effect was won- derful. To use her own words, she felt she was dying. But a short time after the injection, she felt a glow through her. She gradually recovered. No other remedy was used, ex- cepting support to the system. I afterwards tried it with success in other cases ; but in 1862, during another epidemic, I failed. It was tried in Guy's Hospital, at my suggestion, by Doctor Owen Rees in two cases ; one patient rallied, but after two or three days, he had a relapse and died. I have not seen any success from the other remedies. Hunter, G. Y., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-I have seen frequent draughts of common salt and water employed with apparent benefit. Packing in cold sheets I have also seen useful; the patient being afterwards covered by large quantities of clothing, profuse perspiration followed. McDermott, P. A., Surgeon, Bom. B.-Chlorate of potash and sulphuric acid is useful, but the strychnine, belladonna, quassia, and lead I would not give ; as for bleeding, it is, I think, certain death. Martin, ?. E. P., Surgeon, Bom. I.-The advantage of remedies in this stage depends very much upon the intensity of the collapse, In many cases all are useless. But I have seen

Miles, H. L., Surgeon, Bom, B.-With the exception of hot air baths, the whole of these agents are not now Considered worthy of trial. Morton, J. S., Surgeon, Mad. I.-I have tried only sulphuric acid, acetate of lead, opium, hot water and vapour baths ; sometimes these seem useful, but at other times they are power- less or of doubtful value. Ross, J., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-I have tried quassia as an infusion, and Dr. Honigberger's tincture of quassia prepared by himself and used according to his directions. The first Case, and a Very bad one it was, in which I used the tincture, recovered. In every other instance it was useless. I think I have found chlorate of potash, sulphuric acid, acetate of lead opium, hot water baths, simple and with mustard or salt added, all occasionally useful. Spenser, R., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. B.-Not one of these remedies is of the slightest use. In one epidemic of cholera in Bengal, I recollect being ordered to inject all cases with in- fusion of quassia beneath the skin, and the result was sloughing sores and speedy death. Stewart, L. C., Deputy Inspector General, Bom. B.-No, I do not think any of these re- medies likely to be of use in the collapse of cholera, except chlorate of potash in solution. I have seen the endermic use of quassia prove utterly useless. DeTatham, H. D., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-I have injected atropine under the skin, and although the pupils became dilated, no effect on the disease followed. I gave strych- nine in one case, but it was not until many other remedies had been tried, and so the drug can hardly be said to have had a fair trial. Townsend, S. C., Surgeon, Ben. I.-I believe that in belladonna we have a therapeutic agent which in its action on the nervous system is better calculated to do good in the treat- ment of cholera than opium. It is a powerful excitant, its action on the circulation is more decided and more persistent than that of opium, and it does not check secretion. Of 213 cases treated at one branch dispensary with belladonna, 54 died, or 25.3 per cent., and out of 205 cases treated at another branch dispensary, there were only 18 deaths. In the neighbour- hood of this last dispensary, however, the disease did not appear until it was declining else- where, and it was of a much milder type ; but of six cases in a state of collapse thus treated with belladonna by hypodermic injection, four recovered. In these cases the action of the remedy was more rapid, and the increased warmth of the skin very marked. Turner, J., Surgeon Major, Bom. I.-Every one has his hobby. Query No. 10.-Opium is injurious, preventing re-action, and causing coma should re-action come on. Atkin, H., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-I have not seen opium, if properly administered, have any injurious effects or induce comatose symptoms. Coma comes on sometimes whether opium is given or not. Brown, J. C., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I-I do not approve of opium or internal stimulants in the late stages. I recommend external warmth, with cold drinks and frictions. Cardew, G. S., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-Opium in the advanced stage should be forbidden, or if given at all, it must be in small doses as a stimulant, and not as a sedative. Cox, C. L., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-Except as an ingredient in cholera pills, to be used in the first and second stages, I would banish this drug from all cholera hospitals ; for in all the other stages it acts as a poison, suppressing the secretions and accumulating in the system, ready to cause fatal coma when re-action sets in. The first case of cholera I ever saw was at Calcutta in 1842. The patient was treated with large doses of calomel and opium. The cholera symptoms were subdued, but he died of opium poisoning. Moir, R, Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-In this stage, opiates and large quantities of sti- mulants are to be avoided with equal care, as the administration of either seems to hasten the termination of life. Naismith, J., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-I believe opium, alcohol, and chloroform, in every form and combination, to be most hurtful in the latter stages of cholera, as encouraging the tendency to cerebral congestion and effusion which proves so frequently fatal after re-ac- tion has fairly set in. Pitman, H., Surgeon Major, Bom. I.-In my earlier career, I often saw the ill effects of repeated doses of opium, not only in preventing re-action, but also in causing the tendency to death from opium poisoning after re-action, and after the powers of digestion had set in. Saunders, G., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-Opium I considered absolutely perni- cious in every stage of cholera.
73                       REPLIES TO QUERIES OX THE TREATMENT OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.     [Appendix Query No. 10,-continued. Smith, D, B., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Calomel is the sheet anchor.    A drachm at first followed by smaller doses repeated until improvement takes place. While, J., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-I have not found anything do good.    Opiates do much harm. Query 11.-Chloroform or chlorodyne gives temporary relief, but re-action is often followed by head symptoms or delirium. Colles, J. P. C., Assistant, Surgeon, Ben. I.-No medicine that I have tried in the stage of collapse has more thoroughly removed, the signs of obstructed circulation for the time than chloroform given by inhalation. Under its use, cramps cease, and the pulse, warmth, and the color in the face return. These effects are caused by its primary stimulant action; but as this use of chloroform does not promote the elimination of the poison, and as by interfering with respiration it causes the retention of effete matter in the system, it may be doubted whether, except as a palliative, its employment is justifiable in severe cases. My experience leads me to think that it does not prolong (if it does not shorten) life in bad cases, though it certainly relieves distress. Slight cases, which only require stimulation, are benefited by it. Farquhar, T., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Chloroform is readily absorbed during all stages of the disease. Medicines that will relieve the spasms in the lungs, or of the vessels on the surface of the body and mucous membrane of the lungs, may prolong life till the poison works off. Subcutaneous injections may act in the same way. Griffin, M. J., Surgeon, Ben. B.-Yes, if excessively administered; but much good can- not be expected by their employment in this stage of the disease. Hayward, H., Surgeon, Ben. B.-Chloroform in small closes relieves the cramps and stimu- lates the action of the heart, but it increases the danger of congestion of the brain. Chloro- dyue in this stage cannot be relied on, as it tends to check secretions; in fact, it appears to be detrimental. MacRae, D., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-In the case of the 10th Cavalry, neither medicines nor stimulating drinks produced any good results ; but chloroform afforded complete relief from spasms for a short time, although it in no way arrested the progress of the disease. Moor, H. J., Surgeon, Bom. I.-I believe large closes of opium or alcohol will be injurious, as tending to increase the morbid condition already present. I believe the same of chloroclyne, but to a less extent, as the soporific effect of this preparation is not so marked as that of opium. Munro, W., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. B.-I did not find chloroform given internally of any use ; but by inhalation it is very useful. One case (a woman) who suffered terribly from cramps inhaled chloroform at intervals of an hour. She was much relieved. Re-action set in, and she recovered. Roe, S. B., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. B.-I have never observed that the action of chloro- form, used by itself, tends to produce head symptoms, but I have never seen it have any effect in promoting re-action. Ross, J. T. C., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-On chloroform I place much reliance. In cramps it affords the greatest possible relief and benefit to the patient. It saves pain, muscular fatigue, and consequent depression. Given mildly so as to reach its first stimulant effect only, it is very useful in collapse, and with wine to regulate and guide its effects, it continues useful throughout all the stages. Summers, J., Deputy Inspector General, of Hospitals, Ben. B.-No permanent benefit is derived from either. But I never saw much harm in consequence of the use of these remedies. Wood, D., Surgeon, Ben. B.-I have never seen them do permanent good, and in some cases, I think, they shorten the duration of the disease by producing head symptoms, dyspna, und death. Query No. 12.-Brandy, alcohol or wine does not restore the action of the heart or assist re-action, and when re-action does take place it is often violent and dangerous. Atkin, W., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-Brandy, alcohol or wine is of service if care is taken n the administration to avoid the risk of exciting vomittiug. I have seen nothing to lead me to suppose that their use has exercised any injurious influence on the course of events during re-action. Baillie, H., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-A mixture as follows :-Five grains of carbonate of ammenia, one ounce of camphor mixture, one drachm of brandy, one grain of musk. To be given every quarter or half hour, alternately with nourishment.

I.-Drugs are useless, and alcohol worse. I recommend fluids in small quantities, ice, gentle frictions. Banister, G., Surgeon Mayor, Ben. I.-In my experience, alcohol has proved utterly use- less in restoring the action of the heart, and were it not that it is generally vomitted, evil would undoubtedly arise. Its oxidation in the system is absolutely impossible when the capillary circulation is almost arrested. Beatson, J. F., Offg. Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-Nevertheless, the use of either brandy, gin or whiskey is often advisable, given always, in moderation and judiciously administered, and not in mere routine after certain portions of time, the effects being closely watched and the administration duly regulated. Some one stimulant of these named is not out of place usually in the treatment of cases in Europeans, who are, as a rule, more or less in the habit of taking- alcohol in some shape. Burn, W. H S., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-Brandy, alcohol and wine, appear occasionally to assist in restoring the action of the heart, but re-action is apt to be violent and dangerous. It is always a nice point to gauge the moment when stimulants should be withheld. In collapse, the diffusible stimulants are preferable to brandy. Cox, C. L., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-Alcohol next to opium does more harm than any remedy I know of. In moderate doses it effects no permanent good, while it is followed by depression and a craving for more, and this frequently leads to excess followed by re-action, and the case but too often terminates fatally after the disease cholera has passed away. There is, moreover, during cholera epidemics a very general tendency to fly to the brandy bottle for solace, and this tendency is encouraged if the stimulant is known to be in general use in the hospital. I was once at a station with an European cavalry regiment and a troop of horse artillery when cholera became epidemic. Both were as nearly as possible similarly circum- stanced as regards barracks, hospitals, &c. A panic seized the troop, and the men took to exces- sive drinking, while the regiment remained sober. I witnessed man after man of the artillery brought into hospital drunk and blaspheming, and death followed within three or four hours. No such cases were to be seen in the cavalry, and the result was (for the medical treatment was the same in both), that of 18 seizures in the troop, 17 died, whilst out of 32 seizures in the regiment there were only 12 deaths. I could multiply instances of the fatal results that too often follow the use of brandy in cholera without being able to quote anything in its favor, and if I had to-morrow the charge of a cholera hospital, my very first act would be to carefully lock up all brandy, wine, and similar stimulants. Davis, W. T., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-Yes, in some cases I think that they do, but in large doses, they no doubt greatly increase the dangers of over-reaction. Fogo, J. M. S., Surgeon Major, Ben. B.-Stimulants have not been found to exert any in- fluence on the action of the heart. Fraser, A. H., Surgeon, Ben. B.-Are, I think, useless and dangerous. Griffin, M. J., Staff Surgeon, Ben. B.-They do not; and if inordinately employed, the re-action is most decidedly violent and dangerous. Guise, J. A., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-During the stage of collapse you might give prussic acid without effect. But it should be remembered that, when re-action takes place, the system is under the effect, not of the comparatively small quantities which have been given separately, but of the whole collectively. I would not prohibit the use of small quantities of brandy, if the effect be carefully watched, but I have never seen any benefit from it, or from champagne either. I believe salt to be far more useful as a stimulant, and it might be used in the form of a wet sheet. Hastings, T., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-I have seen great mischief caused by an im- moderate use of stimulants, and I would advocate their use in small quantities only ; and more especially after re-action and convalesence have commenced than at any other period of the attack. Hendley, J., Surgeon, Ben. B.-I do not think these stimulants are of any use in this stage, and I have no doubt that they increase the violence of the re-action, when it occurs. Jardine, J., Staff Surgeon, Ben. B.-In moderation they do not do harm. I should think the moderate use of them the preferable course. Pushed beyond moderation, they will do harm in cases where the stomach can absorb them. Joynt, F. G., Surgeon, Bom, I.-They are frequently worse than useless. Kean, W. H,, Surgeon, Mad. I.-Spirits do not appear to have much effect. They do not seem to be rapidly absorbed. Keates, W., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I. -I think diffusible stimulants are preferable to brandy and wine. If brandy is given in excess, no doubt it must have an injurious effect when re-action fairly sets in ; and it is not a good stimulant at any time. Kennedy, J., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. I.-They very often fail in restoring the action of the heart and in inducing re-action ; but I have seen a good many exceptions, and would 21

[Appendix Query No. 12,-continued. therefore advocate the use of brandy properly diluted, and given cautiously so as to avoid violent re-action. Kirkpatrick, J., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-They sometimes also do good. The result may be predicated by the predilection which the patient may show for them. Macpherson, H. M., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-I think brandy, &c., are frequently of the utmost use in assisting- re-action ; and I believe that if given cautiously and stopped when re-action has commenced, the action is most beneficial. Dangerous re-action may set in and too often does, when no such stimulants have been used. Menzies, R., Surgeon, Ben. B.-I think that the less brandy or wine we give, the better; like opium, they are dangerous. Moore, W. J., Surgeon, Bom. I.-I may remark that the effect of alcohol in limiting the waste of tissue, or in other words in retarding metamorphosis of tissue, is admitted by all. When retained by the stomach, there can be little doubt that exhibited in moderate quantities it acts beneficially in all stages of cholera. It is the abuse, and not the use of alcohol which should be deprecated. If administered in too large quantities, it remains undecomposed, attacks the nervous system, and, in the same manner as it would do in health, induces a congested condition of the brain. Norton, J. S., Surgeon, Mad. I.-These do to a certain extent stimulate the vascular and nervous systems. But they do so to a comparatively limited extent, and they require to be used with great caution, and the effects must be carefully watched. The best of these is good brandy. Munro, W., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. B.-Yes; true. Oldham, C. F., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-If anything will restore the action of the heart, stimulants with sinapisms and warmth will do it; but since no known remedy will produce immediate re-action, there is no object in giving' such large quantities as would accumu- late in the stomach. Food, it is generally admitted, should not be withheld at this stage, but surely this is as little likely to be absorbed and as likely to accumulate in the stomach as stimulants in any moderate quantity. I have never seen stimulants given at this stage cause excessive re-action. Rennik, R. H., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. I.-I have always observed that the re-action was violent when brandy had been given too freely. Ruttonjee Hormusjee, Sub-Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-It may be unhesitatingly stated that it cannot be denied that the undue use of opium and stimulants given during the first and second stage of the disease produces these symptoms. Exposure to the sun before the attack strongly predisposes the individual to head symptoms. In the year 1865, cholera broke out twice in the city of Ahmedabad; it was brought in by certain pilgrims who had gone to Palitan and Dacore. Head symptoms were frequently attributed to exposure to the sun during the journey. Ross, J. T. C., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-I place no reliance on alcohol or opium in the advanced stages of the disease, or during collapse ; they would not be absorbed into the system, and in the subsequent re-action their effect would then be to mask symptoms, and to increase the intensity of secondary affections. Summers, J., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. B.-Wine seems powerless, but may be of use nevertheless. I have never seen troublesome re-action to occur in five epidemics I have witnessed, by simply imperfect functions of the various organs. Thom, W., Deputy Inspector General, Bom. I.-To be avoided altogether, except champagne in small quantities. Thomson, W. A., Surgeon, Mad. I.-I am not prepared, from my experience, to join in the sweeping condemnation of brandy, alcohol or wine. I believe the injury attributed to their use has resulted from their having been given rashly and indiscriminately, in fact, poured down the throats of patients who were helpless to resist, until alcoholic poisoning was added to choleraic poisoning. Given judiciously such evil results will not follow. Van Someren, W. J., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-If retained, these stimuli appear to facili- tate re-action, but this is apt then to be turbulent and dangerous. Waters, J. M., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. B.-Brandy and wine are injurious; they induce violent and dangerous re-action. Wood, D., Surgeon, Ben. B.-They prevent restoration of the secretions, produce coma, and complicate re-action. Query No. 13.-Active or powerful remedies should not be used, as in this stage their action is in abeyance. This returns on re-action, and these remedies are often accumulated in the stomach. Banister; G., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-I agree with the proposition. During one epidemic after the recommendation of Dr. Searle, all my cases were treated with scruple doses of
?No. II.] VI.-?HIRD STAGE-COLLAPSE. 81 Query No. 13,-continued. calomel, mixed with a little salt and rubbed on the tongue and buccal mucous surface every quarter or half hour until some evidences of re-action were apparent. Dr. Searle was a Madras medical officer. He stated in his pamphlet on cholera, which was widely circulated by Government, that a professional man who neglected to treat his cholera patient in this way should be indicted for homicide. The result was, over and over again, that numbers of those who recovered from collapse died from consecutive fever in conjunction with enteritis. As much as three ounces of calomel have thus been given to one patient. I do not remember, however, that salivation ever took place. Cox, C. L., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. I.-In this stage all powerful remedies are dangerous. They remain inert in the system until re-action takes place. After re-action their accumulated action is often more than the enfeebled patient can bear, and I have seen fatal ptyalism induced in this way. Elliot, R. C., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. I.-Medicines are apparently useless in this stage, however powerful they may be, and there is danger from their action when re-action has set in. Grantt, W., Surgeon, Bom. B.-I can only say that during complete collapse I have no faith whatever in alcohol or drugs, as it appears to me that the assimilative powers of the body are, for the time being, completely suspended. It is not improbable, however, that the injudicious use of these may sometimes lead to unfavorable results after the setting in of re-action, when the organs have resumed their natural functions; but I have not been much impressed with this result in the course of my experience. Williamson, W., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-Nothing, in my opinion, is more pernicious than the system of pouring quantities of medicines or stimulants into a pulseless patient. The best thing in the stage of full collapse is to gratify pretty freely the instinctive desire of the patient for cold water. Query No. 15.-To support the strength-small quantities of soup, arrowroot or sago with a little brandy. Liebig's extract of raw meat is useful in very protracted cases. Kean, W.H, Surgeon, Mad. I.-These are, in my opinion, the most useful means, and will be retained when the drugs and spirits above referred to are rejected. Maclean, A., Surgeon, Bom. B.-Liebig's extract would be invaluable; what seems to be wanted is a powerfully stimulating and rapidly nutritious dietary. Moore, W. J., Surgeon, Bom. I.-Leibig's meat soup used cold will sometimes be retained when nothing else can be taken. During collapse, medicines are useless; nourishment and some stimulant is required. Ross, J., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-It was this plan of dealing with collapse to which I refer- red in my answer to the first query in this section. If in such cases we leave nature and the disease to fight the battle out without assisting the former by nourishment, we fail to give the patient the only chance in our power. By a judicious use of soup, arrowroot, and such like, with, in some cases, perhaps a little brandy or wine, we give our patient the benefit of this last chance, and by doing so we may be instrumental in saving his life. Query No. 16.-Fatigue must be avoided, especially getting up to stool or assuming the erect position, which is often followed by fatal syncope. On a march, bad cases to be left in hospital. Banister, G., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Most important. I have witnessed many instan- taneously fatal results from muscular exertion and mental emotion. One poor fellow on being awakened from sleep by the shrieks of a comrade started up in bed and fell down dead. Cowen, H. L., Surgeon Major, Mad. B.-I have seen death ensue suddenly from syncope. A patient got out of bed to go to stool against orders, and fell down m a fatal fit of fainting on assuming the erect posture. Fogo, J. M. S., Surgeon Major, Ben. B.-A patient with cholera should never be allowed to raise his head from the horizontal position, as all his strength should be husbanded. It is a curious fact noticed in this disease that a patient may be able to move about on his legs, with a pulseless wrist, and yet not have syncope. Illingworth, J. A., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. B.-I agree entirely with this opinion. A pa- tient of mine, far in canvalescence, was allowed to get up to stool, against my directions, and he died before he could be assisted back into his bed. Jackson, J. M., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. I.-Yes; all medicines should be given with the feeding bottle, the patient being kept perfectly quiet. I have known patients die when raised to take medicine, and also when taken up to stool. Morgan, W. H., Surgeon, Mad. I.-My predecessor in this regiment (23rd Native Infan- try), in one of his annual reports, says :-"The fatal termination in many cases could be directly

[Appendix Query No. 16,-continued. and positively attributed to the fact of the patient having been raised up by the orderly into a sitting posture, after re-action had set in, but while the heart was too weak to bear the change of position." My patients have their nourishment administered from a feeding bottle. Munro, W., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. B.-The patient should never be allowed to sit up. Great restlessness of a patient is, in my experience, a bad, nay fatal symptom. Leave all bad cases in hospital on the occasion of a move taking place. Rennick, R. II, Deputy Inspector General, Mad. I.-Anything that tends further to exhaust the waning vital powers should be avoided as much as possible. On the line of march I have seen many a case which gave promise of overcoming the disease terminate fatally from the fatigue undergone in removal from the hospital tent to the dooly. I have seen evil consequences follow also from exposure to cold. Smith, H. S., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-Yes, many patients both in cholera and fever have died of cardiac syncope, who would, I am convinced, have recovered if they had avoided exer- tion and the attempt to sit or stand up. VII.-FOURTH STAGE, R?-AC????. Query No. 1.-This is a natural stage of the disease taking place in all but extremely severe cases, and little accelerated by remedies, though the subsequent symptoms often are exaggerated by their use. The restlessness subsides, the burning thirst disappears, the pulse with warmth returns, and bile appears in the stools. At this period brandy and opium are powerful poisons. Banister, G., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-I have considered it advisable in some instances to cup at the nape of the neck for cerebral excitement, and to apply leeches to the right hypochon- drium for hepatic congestion. In many such cases, the collapse had not been profound, and the cases of these patients had hardly awakened anxiety amidst the surrounding horrors; and yet over and over again, some of these apparently mild attacks ended fatally from rapidly developed visceral complications, owing perhaps to the previous indiscriminate exhibition of stimulants. Chevers, N., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Discontinue medicine, give ice, use counter-irritation to the epigastrium if the stomach is irritable, and small effervescing draughts with hydrocyanic acid, iced milk; fomentations, dry cupping, sinapisms to loins to solicit renal action. DeFabeck, F. W. A., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-Yes, but it is also the stage which requires more than any other the careful attention of the physician. Durant, J. J., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-The return to health is a natural process, and so should not be impeded or hastened in any way by remedies. The manner of its onset is much the same as here depicted; besides the bile, the urine also at times is passed, though scantily. These are two very important symptoms. Brandy and opium are strongly contra- indicated in this stage. Fogo, J. M. S., Surgeon Major, Ben. B.-As soon as re-action is established, the eliminative treatment, so called, by castor-oil should be commenced. Brandy and opium should be looked upon as poisons. Griffin, J., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. B.-Yes, but I cannot concur with the opinion that it is a natural stage of the disease taking place in all but extremely serious cases, as death in several instances has occurred prior to the supervention of re-action. At this period brandy and opium are directly powerful poisons. Hooper, W. R., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-Re-action naturally takes place, and is propor- tionate to the amount of materies morbi left in the system, and to the congestion of important- organs, particularly the kidneys. The greater the amount of poison in the system, the higher the fever, and the more severe are the subsequent symptoms. Jackson, J. N., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. I.-To my mind, this is the most critical period, and the patient requires constant and unceasing attention. Opium. I would not give, but very weak brandy and water I would not object to. Kendall, H., Surgeon Major, Ben. B.-Yes, the re-action should be watched and especially the return of the secretions. Avoid opium. Kennedy, J., Deputy Inspector General, Mad. I.-Brandy and opium should never be used in this stage. Lownds, T. M., Surgeon, Bom. J.-Re-action I consider to be the recovery from the weaken- ed state left by collapse, with the complication caused by the effete material remaining in the system. McLean, A., Surgeon, Ben. B.-One important indication is to assist the efforts of nature in establishing re-action, care being taken not to overdo it. Under these circumstances brandy and opium are objectionable and dangerous.
?No. II. ] VII.-FOURTH STAGE-RE-ACTION. 83 Query No. 1,-continued. McDowall, C., Surgeon, Bom. I.-The injection of solution of morphia under the skin was always followed by re-action in fifteen cases, all of which were collapsed when brought for treat- ment. Where re-action is weak and the patient is in danger of failing into the typhoid state from urmic poisoning, stimulation may be required. Menzies, R., Surgeon, Ben. B.-Yes, they are powerful poisons. Miles, H. L., Surgeon, Bom. B.-A natural stage of the disease. The less this stage is ex- perimented on the better for the sufferec. Brandy and opium are alike pernicious. Mills, J., Surgeon Major, Bom. I.-Opium is to be avoided now, as in the former stages, as much as possible, on account of its tendency to promote cerebral disturbance and to check the restoration of the secretion of urine, to effect which is now one of the most important indi- cations. Hyoscyamus may be used to induce sleep without fear of affecting the brain. I have found greater tendency to cerebral congestion in the more robust patients. Munro, W., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. B.-Yes. Murray, T., Surgeon Major, Bom. I.-This is the natural stage of the disease which is anxiously looked for, and when developed, brandy and opium are contra-indicated and would be highly injurious. O'Leary, T. C., Surgeon Major, Mad. B.-To which may be added the secretion of urine, mostly, if not always, a very favorable sign. Brandy and opium if now given will kill the patient. Rice, W. R., Sure/eon, Ben. I.-The period of convalescence requires much care, which should not he hastily discontinued. I have met with several cases where chronic organic disease of the digestive organs was set down to an attack of cholera, and with fairness, when the details furnished by the patient were fully weighed. Amongst these, I have met with a case of chronic gastritis with most troublesome enlargement and ulcration of the tonsils, another of chronic and incurable dirraha, a third of chronic inflammation of the capsule and areolar tissue of the liver, resulting in cirrhosis, and in a fourth Bright's disease of the kid- neys appeared. In all of these, the patients stated that the symptoms arose out of an attack of cholera which they had one or more years before. Any unfavorable symptoms which may arise should be treated on general principles. Roberts, W. H., Assistant Surgeon, Mad. I.-This is a natural stage of the disease, and its occurrence is hoped and prayed for by the physician, the patient, and his friends. I do not believe that it is in our power to accelerate its advent; it is much better that we should be specially careful that we do not retard it. The after-effects of previous treatment will now manifest themselves for good or for evil. Brandy and opium combined would be a poison. Nourishment and time to allow the system to rally and the secretions to resume their opera- tions is what is chiefly required. Roe, S. B., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. B.-Re-action has taken place (as nearly as I can ascer- tain) in three-fourths of the cases that have come under my observation. The stage is, I think, a short one, and most of the symptoms alluded to in the folio wing queries might be re- ferred to a fifth stage or one of subsequent fever. Sainte, J. D., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. B.-A natural stage of the disease. Yes, brandy and opium are positively injurious. Simpson, D., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-Busy interference as re-action is beginning can- not be too strongly reprehended. The secreting organs must be allowed time to recover their functions and the blood time to regain at least its watery constituents before absorption and secretion can be established. Smith, C. M., Surgeon Major, Bom. I.-Though certainly a stage of the disease in a medical point of view, the existing condition arises not from the disease itself, but rather from the effects of the previous changes and alterations that have taken place in the blood and secreting organs, generally aggravated by the remedies and stimulants that have been employed in the first stage. Smith, D. B., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Discontinue calomel, or give it at longer intervals. Diuretics and quinine, castor oil. Nourishment. Query No. 4.-Quinine in small doses is very valuable in restoring the secretions and pre- venting the recurrence of collapse, especially in the rainy season. Eteson, A., Surgeon, Ben I.-Although many, indeed most cases are so violent that the disease proceeds unchecked to the end, yet I have seen a great number especially among natives, where almost when the patient was at the last gasp, the disease could be clearly seen to have expended itself, and in such a case if strong nourishing soup, warmth, quiet, and, in short, all the details of good nursing are provided, the little spark of life may once more be fanned alight. The smallest dose of quinine, the warmth of a succession of flannels, and even of persons, may then be of far more value than the unceasing doses of the collapse 22

Lucky is the physician who at this encouraging moment has not his hopes dashed by the remembrance of half a dozen or more opium pills, belladonna, strychnine, brandy, nitrate of silver, &c., to be still accounted for under the head of re-actionary fever. Martin, T. E. P., Surgeon, Bom I.-Quinine is valuable in all sorts of ways in this country as a tonic and antiperiodic, but it is of particular use in commencing re-action after collapse. Young, II., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-I have frequently used quinine in small doses in this stage, added to small quantities of nourishment, with benefit. Query No. 6.-Suppression of urine calls for immediate treatment; fomentations and blisters to the loins, nitrate of potash, ether, tincture of cantharides. Allen, M., Assistant Surgeon Ben. I.-Hyposulphite of soda mixture every 3 hours. Mustard plasters, dry cupping for congestion of the head. Blisters to temples. Bell, A., Surgeon, Ben. B.-I have never seen this symptom benefited by any treatment. Blacklock, A., Surgeon, Major, Mad. I.-Turning the patient on his abdomen and keep- ing him in that position as much as possible is best of all. Enemata (cold) containing sweet spirit of nitre are good. Frequent sponging of face and hands with very cold water is also good. Brougham, J. P., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Diuretics, calomel in small doses, citric acid, benzoate of ammonia, iced milk. Chevers, N., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-I avoid cantharides and turpentine, even externally. I apply dry cupping, sinapisms, simple fomentation and large poultices to the loins. I give no diuretic, except the most natural of all, i. e., diluents in considerable quantities. Where there is urmia I use small doses of castor oil or seidlitz powder, with saline enemata. In ordinary cases where the stools are deficient, the tongue coated, the eyes injected, or the brain torpid, I use congee-water or saline enemata. Durant, J. J., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-All very useful, and should be tried in turn. Counter-irritation to the loins, and tincture of cantharides with large doses of calomel, seems to claim a foremost place in restoring the secretions. Faucs, J., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-Purging to ensure at least six full motions daily. Francis, C. R., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-Attend to existing symptoms. For urmia use diluents and diuretics, sinapisms, and dry cupping. Castor oil, repeated at intervals, should be given to relieve congestion, and to remove the superfluous calomel. Fayrer, J., Surgeon, Ben. I.-Restore secretion to the kidneys and bowels. Diuretics, laxatives and salines may be needed. Look out for pneumonia or other low forms of inflam- mation. Fogo, J. M. S., Surgeon Major, Ben. B.-But suppression of urine may still exist, and small doses of oil of turpentine given with castor oil, if this is still indicated, have been found most beneficial, or these may be given (always watching the effect of the medicine) without the castor oil, in mucilage or with beaten yolk of egg. Fuller, S., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. B.-The suppression of urine is the result of all the watery portion of the blood having passed off by the bowels, and is not due to the impaired function of the kidneys. Greene, J. A., Civil Surgeon, Ben. I.-Potas, chlorat. grs. 5, liquor. ammon. acet. 1 dram, water 1 oz., every 2 hours; vinegar and water to the head, and also sponging the body. Jardine, J., Staff Surgeon, Ben. B.-Blisters to the loins might prove very distressing to the patient and should be avoided. Nothing need be dune till re-action begins, for nothing will be of any avail. The turpentine fomentations, dry heat to the loins (for the intolerable sense of internal heat is by this time subsiding, and warmth to the loins can now be borne), with mild diureties, e. g., acetate of potash, sweet spirit of nitre, and barley water, will generally be found sufficient. Cantharides should be used sparingly if used at all.  MacLeod, A. C., Surgeon Major, Mad. I.-With the restoration of the renal function, the patient may be considered comparatively safe. As long as it is absent, he is in imminent danger. There is no such certain diuretic under these circumstances, in my opinion, as a large. square blister covering the whole of the loins. I have known the kidneys act within a very short time after its application. In such cases, it may be immediately removed. Once fairly set a going, the kidneys will continue to act without further stimulation. I am opposed equally to the administration of internal remedies in this stage, as the stomach is still in an irritable state, and needs rest. I should not resort to other diureties till the blister had first been tried. In very young children cajuput oil rubbed over the loins and abdomen will be found the best diuretic.
?No. II.] VII.-FOURTH STAGE-RE-ACTION. 85 Query No. 6,-continued. Menzies, R., Surgeon, Ben. B.-In the cases I have treated, both Europeans and Natives, I have used a combination of chloroform and tinct. scillas with marked good effects; water being passed after d or 6 hours. Dry cupping has likewise proved useful. Moir, IV., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-Sinapisms, dry cupping, turpentine, and poultices or even blisters, may be applied over the hepatic and renal regions to remove congestion by their derivative effect, and thus to induce the natural functions of the organs. After a free application of these external remedies, acetate or chlorate of potash, sweet spirit of nitre, and possibly tincture of cantharides even may be administered internally. Munro, IV., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. B.-Warm fomentation or with turpentine added, dry cupping, and if there is pain in the loins, leeching. Blisters over the kidneys I object to, and also to the use of cantharides. Nitrate of potash, acetate of potash, liquor potass, &c., I would use internally. Pitman, H., Surgeon Major, Bom. I.-I should avoid all of these. If any thing can be done, the powers of the body will do it. I would rather trust to demulcent liquids. Playfair, G. R., Surgeon Major, Ben. I.-This is a matter about which there can be no doubt. The congestion of the kidneys is always present, and the best pathologists in Europe have said so. Congestion causes suppression of urine; about this also there can be no ques- tion, and I have shown that suppression of urine per se, without any cholera complication, is dangerous and often fatal. Roe, A. B., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. B.-The external treatment would, I believe, be neces- sary; but unless there were some urgent symptoms present, such as a tendency to coma, I would not be inclined to use the tincture of cantharides. Simpson, D., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-If the kidneys do not act, symptoms of urmia appear and the patient dies comatose, or else the thoracic and abdominal organs become in- flamed. To obviate this, an attempt must be made to restore the renal secretion. Potash salts with broom tops, squill and nitric ether may be prescribed, and the loins dry cupped;  and if it be necessary, an ounce or two of blood may be abstracted. A tendency to diarrha at times exists; it generally yields to simple astringents, compound rhubarb pill, or Dover's powder. Vegetable bitters are required to promote digestion and to strengthen the system. In the majority of fatal cases after reaction, death has been caused by urmia. The kidney secretion has been partially restored in some cases, but in others diuretics have failed. Smith, H. S., Assistant Surgeon, Ben. I.-This symptom is the most alarming. I have seen cases, where there would otherwise have been much reason for hope, often hold out even for a week, and this would lead you to suppose from a merely cursory examination that they were doing well. A negative reply to the query as to whether or not the patient has yet passed water must always excite alarm. It is in cases of this sort, when the patient would otherwise have every chance of recovery, that I should be inclined to use salines in every way, by mouth, by euemata, by hypodermic injection, and by the bath. Spencer, R., Assistant Surgeon, Bom. B.-For suppression of urine use hot fomentation of infusion of digitalis and dry cupping to the loins, and give plenty of pure cold water to drink. I have seen this sufficient. Sexton, E , Assistant Surgeon, Bom. I.-One of the earliest and most encouraging symptoms of re-action is the restoration of the renal secretion. Suppression of urine is always an untoward symptom, and immediate measures must be taken for its relief. Summers, /., Deputy Inspector General, Ben. B.-Urmia is a very alarming symptom, since fatal coma soon follows. It is the most frequent cause of death in cholera after re-action. Additional Illustration to Section III, Query No. 9. Macnamara, F. N., Surgeon, Ben. I.-I have very frequently seen the Calla Murrees among the coolies of the Dhanghur caste. In 1864-65, we had upwards of 1,500 cases of cholera in the Assam and Cachar coolie depots, and it was then a most common thing for these unfor- tunate people to die, two or three at a time, as if they had been killed by some poison paraly- sino- suddenly all the vital energies. The native doctors used to report to me thus-"one man of the gang had cholera and died, and the rest fell about like dead men, and they also died." The men died in an hour or so without vomiting or purging, as if in a deadly faint. Others might vomit once or twice, or might be purged once or twice with the characteristic discharges.
