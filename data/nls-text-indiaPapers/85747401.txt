Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Liéutenant-Governor of the Panjab, in the Home (Medical and Sanitary) Department, No. 877, S., dated Simla, the 27th July 1897. READ( 2 ) the total number of operations by the District and Special Staff fell from 38,192 to 26,959, it does not appear possible to associate this with any such evidences of failure in the operations as might be expected to produce distrust in the efficacy of the process. In Gujranwala, in 1895-96, the percentage of successful vaccinations by the District Staff was 87.63 (primary) and 44.19 (re-vaccinations) against provincial averages of 93.36 and 56.66 respectively ; the corresponding figures for the district in 1896-97 being 85.48 and 28.06, showing a further deterioration. In Jullundur, where however there was a distinct increase in operations, if the work of the Special Staff be counted, the percentages of success were bad in both years (75 71 and 27 21 in 1895-96, and 83.08 and 32.12 in 1896-97). The unfavourable percentages in both these districts and the diminution in the operations in the former appear to His Honor to call for enquiry. 7. The percentages of success attained by the Special Staff when compared with the figures for 1895 show a falling-off of 3.36 in the case of primary operations, but a most satisfactory increase of 10.62 in the case of re-vaccinations. With reference, however, to the very large increase in the number of these operations performed by the Special Staff and to the remarks on the subject of re-vaccination in previous reviews, it is to be hoped that operations of the kind were not unnecessarily resorted to, and that the interval of seven years between vaccination and re-vaccination, to which reference is made in paragraph 4 of the review on the Vaccination Report for the year 1892-93, was duly observed. A peculiar feature of the figures, and one of which some explanation should have been attempted, is the lower percentage of success attained in primary operations by the Special Staff in comparison with the other agencies, and its steady diminution since 1893-94. In that year the Special Staff, with the high percentage of 95.14, was more successful than any other agency. The percentage fell in 1894-95 to 93.49, in 1895-96 to 90.29, and in the year under review to 86.93, 7 per cent. below the percentage for the District Staff. It appears from the figures given in Appendix A to the Report that this percentage would be considerably improved if cases of which the results are unknown were excluded from computation, but the Lieutenant-Governor does not understand under what circumstances so large a proportion of the results remain unknown, and will be glad to have this explained when the report referred to in paragraph 10 of this review is submitted. Paragraph 13. 8. It is satisfactory to hear that the work of the Divisional Inspectors continues to be good. The question of making their appointments sub. pro tem. has been very properly made the subject of a separate letter by the Sanitary Commissioner, and His Honor's orders will be passed on that letter in due course. Paragraph 14 and Appendix A. 9. As regards the efficacy of the vaseline lymph, it is not possible to accept the statement in Appendix A. of the Report that the results obtained with this medium by the Special Staff were only slightly inferior to those obtained with buffalo lymph. In primary vaccinations with vaseline there were 855 admitted failures against 18,844 successful cases, a percentage of 4.3 ; in primary vaccinations with buffalo lymph there were 675 admitted failures against 38,443 successful cases, a percentage of only 1.7. In the case of re-vaccinations if cases of which the results are unknown be excluded the percentage of failures was 33.9 with vaseline lymph and only 20.7 with buffalo lymph. The results of the use of the different kinds of lymph in the Province as a whole, which probably do not furnish so satisfactory a basis for comparison, are given in paragraph 14 of the Report. These results are favourable to vaseline lymph under the head of re-vaccinations, but distinctly unfavourable under the head of primary vaccinations. 10. The Lieutenant-Governor is quite prepared to accept the view that the difficulties in the preparation of the vaseline lymph and in the performance of vaccination by its means can only gradually be overcome, and he does not desire the foregoing remarks to be taken as in any way prejudging
( 3 ) this new, and, in some respects at all events, evidently promising experiment. The report which has been asked for in this office letter No. 587, dated 21st December 1896, is awaited before any final opinion is formed on the subject, and it is not improbable that the materials for such an opinion will take some years to collect. Paragraph 18 and Appendix A. 11. The Lieutenant-Governor concurs with the Sanitary Commissioner's commendation of Surgeon-Captain C. H. James, and desires that his thanks may be conveyed to that officer for his good work during the nine months that he performed the duties of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner. His Honor also desires to convey to Brigade- Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Roe his personal acknowledgments of his continued energy and zeal in the supervision of the Vaccination Department.

No.71/1409. FROM BDE.-SURG.-LT.-COL. W. A. CRAWFORD ROE, F.R.C.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, To H. J. MAYNARD, ESQUIRE, Junior Secretury to the Government of Punjab. Dated LAHORE, the 1st July 1897. SIR, I have the honor to forward the Annual Vaccination Returns for the year 1896-97 with the following remarks. Administration of the Department. 2. Surgeon-Captain C. H. James held charge of the office of Deputy- Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, from the 1st of April 1896 to the 5th of January 1897. He proceeded on three months' privilege leave on the 6th of January 1897, and during his absence Surgeon-Captain G. Y. C. Hunter officiated for him. The strength of the Vac- cination establishment. 3. The strength of the Vaccination Staff consisted, on an average, of 6 Divisional Inspectors, 34 Native Supervisors and 303 Vac- cinators. The number of Divisional Inspectors and Native Supervisors remained the same as last year, but there was an increase of 3 Vaccinators over the number employed during the previous year, viz., 2 in Bannu, 1 in Pesháwar, 1 in Ludhiána, while the staff in Hoshiárpur was reduced by one. Cost of the Department. 4. The total expenditure of the Vaccination Department amounted to Rs. 1,02,179 against Rs. 1,00,502 during the previous year, showing a net increase of Rs. 1,677. The cost under different heads, compared with the previous year, is shown in the sub- joined table 2 Cost of each successful case. 5. The cost for each successful vaccination was 2 annas and 2 pies, against 2 annas and 1 pie during the previous year. Vaccinations performed by different establishments. 6. The following statement shows the number of primary vaccinations and re-vaccinations performed by different establishments in 1896-97, as contrasted with the figures for 1895-96 : 3 Cause of decrease. 8. The cause of decrease in the number of primary vaccinations per- formed by the District Staff is generally attributed by the Civil Surgeons, to the prevailing scarcity in the Pro- vince, emigration, and excessive prevalence of small-pox, and from my personal knowledge I am inclined to agree with this opinion. Re-vaccination by the District Staff. 9. The number of re-vaccinations done by the District Staff was 188,777 against 204,832 during the previous year, a decrease of 16,055. The largest number of secondary vaccina- tions, 59,029, were done in the district of Hoshiárpur. In Rohtak, Gurgáon, Umballa, Pesháwar, Kohát and Muzaffargarh the District Staff did very little re-vaccination work. Work done by the Special Staff. 10. The Special Staff under the supervision of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner performed 67,780 primary vaccinations as compared with 61,708 last year, showing an increase of 6,072. Under the head of re-vaccinations the increase was most marked, the number of operations amounting to 34,113 or almost double the number done in the previous year. The percentages of successful primary vaccinations and re-vaccinations were 86.93 and 61.84 against 90.29 and 51.22, respectively, dur- ing the previous year. Cantonment vaccination. 11. The cantonments which entertain their own Vaccinators show 4,875 primary and 4,218 secondary operations, or 91.92 and 66.00 per cent. successful, the percentages of success- ful cases during the previous year being 94.77 and 75.58, respectively. Dispensary vaccination. 12. The work done at the dispensaries was satisfactory, the number of primary and secondary vaccinations being 3,737 and 2,227 as compared with only 2,282 and 987 last year, the per- centages of success being 89.11 and 64.53 against 93.38 and 51.57. Inspection work. 13. The subjoined table shows the inspection work of the officers of the Vaccination Department during the year4 operations but in the registration of vital statistics also.&quot; I strongly recommend that these appointments be made sub. pro-tem so as to enable these officials to enjoy all the privileges of permanent incumbents in respect to privilege and other leave. The details of the inspection work by the different officers are shown in Statement No. V. Results of different kinds of lymph. 14. The results of the different kinds of lymph with which vaccinations were performed during the year are shown in the following statement:Diagram showing the Death-rates from Small-pox per 10,000 of Population during the year 1896-97, the average rate of mortality from Small-pox per 10,000 of Population for the five years ending 1895-96, and the proportion of successful Vaccinations during the years 1881-82 to 1896-97, per 10,000 of Population in each District of the Punjab. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] NOTE.5 18. The report of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner for 1896-97 is Deputy Sanitary Com- given as an appendix. Much credit is due to Dr. James misioner's report. for his efficient supervision of the Special Staff; and for his work in connection with the. introduction of vaseline lymph, the results of which are most favourable. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, W. A. CRAWFORD ROE, F.R.C.S., BDE.-SURG.-LIEUT.-COL., Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab.

The Annual Vaccination Report of the Special Staff, Punjab, for the year 1896-97, by Surgeon-Captain G. Y. C. HUNTER, I. M. S., Officiating Deputy Sanitary Com- missioner, Punjab. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner. The office of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner was held by Surgeon-Captain C. H.. James, I. M. S., from the beginning of the vaccination year (April 1st, 1896) to January 5th, 1897. I have held charge from January 6th to the end of the year. Work done by Special Staff Vaccinators. 2. The Special Staff Vaccinators performed 101,893 vaccinations during the year 1896-97. Of these 67,780 were primary operations and 34,113 re- vaccinations. There is an increase of 22,588 on the total number of vaccinations performed in the previous year when 79,305 persons were vaccinated by the Special Staff. The increase is in both primary operations and re- vaccinations. The primary vaccinations have risen from 61,708 last year to 67,780 this year showing a gain of 6,072 and the re-vaccinations from 17,597 to 34,113, giving an in- crease of 16,516. The numbers vaccinated according to their classes or sects is shewn in an Appendix to this report. This, viz., 101,893, is the largest number of vaccinations that has ever been perform- ed by the Special Staff, and the fact may be looked upon as very satisfactory. This result is greatly due to the fact of vaseline lymph being used for the first time to any great extent, and this of itself constitutes a strong argument in favor of Dr. Bamber's vaseline lymph being introduced in the place of buffalo calf lymph, as the Vaccinators being provided with a supply of ready made lymph can naturally get over a much larger area and consequently perform many more operations in a given time than if they had the delay of obtaining and vaccinating.calves to contend with at each village. A glance at the table below will shew the number of vaccinations performed by the Special Staff since the year 1889-90xi Vaseline lymph. It will be seen by reference to the above table that the percentage of success given by vaseline lymph is slightly below that shewn by the buffalo calf lymph. There are, however, several reasons to account for this :xii The percentage of successes in the Special Staff work found by us was 95.04 for primary and 68.53 for re-vaccinations. I found as a rule that the returns of the Vaccinators were fairly accurate. This fact being undoubtedly due to the greater supervision in recent years. Only in one case were false returns discovered and the Vaccinator was promptly punished. In the accompanying statement is shewn the number of inspections done by us in the various districts. Average cost of a suc- cessful vaccination. 5. The average cost of a successful vaccination this year has been 3 annas 11 pies. This is a decrease of 11 pies on the preceding year, which is satisfactory. The decrease is chiefly due to the greater number of vaccinations done. Changes in Special Staff. 6. The only change which has taken place in the Special Staff is that 3rd Class Vaccinator Hari Rám was transferred to the Rohtak District Staff at his own request exchanging with 3rd Class Vaccinator Devi Ditta from that district who was entertained in his place. Punishmeuts. 7. The following punishments have been inflicted during the year:xiii In compliance with the instructions of the Punjab Government conveyed in their letter No. 587 of the 21st December last regular weekly supplies of vaseline lymph were sent out from the depôt at Amritsar to the Civil Surgeons of Umballa, Ludhiána, Jullundur, Hoshiárpur, Lahore and Gurdáspur, while the Civil Surgeon of Karnál was supplied with lymph on four different occasions as was desired by him. Civil Surgeons of these selected districts are expected to submit their opinions on the use of vaseline lymph and its advantages and disadvantages direct to the Sani- tary Commissioner in their Annual Vaccination Reports for 1896-97. In addition to this numerous indents were received from Civil Surgeons of other districts as well as from Medical Officers of Cantonments and Regiments, and the results seem to have given satisfaction. Notes on Dr. Bamber's vaseline lymph. 10. This is the first year in which vaseline lymph has been used on any extensive scale, and the results fully justify the hopes entertained of it. I have explained in paragraph 3 the reasons why the percentage of successes is slightly below that of ordinary buffalo calf lymph. There is one point I should like to allude to. It has been objected that the scars after vaccination with vaseline lymph do not usually present that pitted appearance which some people maintain as the test of a good scar and efficient protection. As regards the pitting of scars Dr. Bamber maintains, and I have noticed, the same fact that pitting or the absence of it is simply dependent on the degree of attendant inflammation and consequent destruction of tissue. If in a given vesicle the inflammation is limited in extent the resultant scar will present a pitted appearance ; if, on the other hand, however, there is much suppuration as is common in this country owing to dirt and neglect or by using too much lymph, and the skin is involved and destroyed to a greater extent, the scar will not be pitted. Granting this to be true the pitting would have no reference to the kind of lymph used, but would simply depend on the degree of attendant inflammation ; and, as a matter of fact, I have noticed that scars, due to vaccination by vaseline lymph when the inflamma- tion has been moderate and the vesicle carefully protected, present the same pitted appearance as those done by any other form of lymph. I need not here enter into the advantages and arguments in favor of vaseline lymph, as this has already been treated of fully in the Annual Vaccination Report of last year and also in Dr. James' letter No. 756, dated 21st December 1896, to the Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, which has been laid before the Punjab Government ? and in which he also advocated the extension and improvement of the present depôt. With regard to this latter point I feel I cannot urge it too strongly as it is evident if the lymph is to give good results we must have the depôt on a proper basis and the necessary means at our disposal. I have seconded Dr. James' scheme for a new depôt with a few modifications in a letter to the Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, dated 31st March 1897.

Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Lieutenant-Governer of the Punjab in the Home (Medical and Sanitary) Department, No. 702 S., dated the 29th of July 1898. READ2 The Lieutenant-Governor has recently addressed the Sanitary Commis- sioner with reference to that officer's proposals for the establishment of suitable depôts for the preparation of this lymph, observing that though he is open to conviction of the fact that its partial failure is due to unfavourable conditions in its preparation and use, he is unable at present to regard this as proved, but inviting such suggestions as will render it possible to give the lymph a fairer trial without committing Government to any large outlay on what must still be regard- ed in the light of an experiment, 5. The Lieutenant-Governor desires to convey to the Sanitary Commis- sioner his recognition of the manner in which he has supervised the Department during the year under review under the difficult circumstances created by the prolonged absence of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner.

No. 23/2303 FROM BDE.-SURG.-LT.-COL. W. A. CRAWFORD ROE, F,R.C.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, To H. J. MAYNARD, ESQUIRE, Junior Secretary to the Government of Punjab. Dated LAHORE, the 1st July 1898. SIR, I have the honor to submit the Annual Vaccination Statements for the year 1897-98, with the following brief remarks. Administration of the Department. 2. On return from privilege leave Surgeon-Captain C. H. James took over charge of the office of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner from Dr. Hunter on the 3rd April. From the 6th April to 6th June Dr. James was on plague duty at Bombay, and during his absence Dr. Hunter acted for him. Dr. James resumed his duties on the 7th June. From 21st October up to the end of the official year Dr. James worked as special Plague Medical Officer in the Jullundur district under the orders of the Inspector-General, Civil Hospitals, Punjab. Strength of the Vaccina- tion Establishment 3. In the following table the strength of the Vaccination Establishment is contrasted with the previous year: 2 The total cost of the Department was Rs. 98,508, or Rs. 3,671 less than in the previous year. There was a considerable decrease under the head of &quot; Travelling allowance,&quot; owing to the deputation of Dr. James to the plague- infected district of Jullundur for upwards of five months. Cost of each successful vaccine operation. 5. The cost of each successful operation was exactly the same as last year, viz., 2 annas and 2 pies. Vaccinations performed by different establishments. 6. The subjoined table gives the vaccination operations performed by different establishments during the years 1896-97 and 1897-98:3 of working by bodies beginning from one centre followed and directly controlled by the Native Supervisors who were held responsible for the entire, manage- ment of the operations. Stringent orders were issued to Civil Surgeons in the beginning of the year to punish the vaccination staff in cases where they failed to work on the new system. Re-vaccinations perform- ed by District Staff. 12. The District Staff performed a total of 180,564 re-vaccinations; of these 59.21 per cent. were successful. Last year the percentage of success was 59.19 and the total number of re-vaccinations performed was 188,777. The largest number of re-vaccinations was done in Kángra (59,583) and in Hoshiárpur (45,095). Thus more than half the total re-vaccinations were performed in these two districts alone. This is due entirely to the influence and exertions of Pandit Bal Kishen, the Divisional Inspector of these two districts. Work of the Special Staff. 13. There was again an increase this year in the primary vaccinations performed by the Special Staff, the number being 72,031 against 67,780 in 1896-97, showing an increase of 4,251. Under the head of re-vaccinations there was a decrease of 3,009 as compared with the figures for the preceding year, the number performed being 31,104 against 34,113. The percentage of success in primary operations was 88.73 against 86.93 in 1896-97 and in re-vaccinations 69.07 against 61.84. Work of Cantonment Staff 14. In the large cantonments, which pay for their own Vaccinators, the number of primary operations amounted to 5,185 and re-vaccinations to 1,482 : the corresponding figures for the previous year being 4,875 and 4,218, the percentage of primary successful cases was 95.08 and re-vaccinations 80.70. In 1896-97 the percentages were 91.92 and 66.00, respectively. Work performed by the Dispensary Staff. 15. The number of primary operations performed by the Dispensary Staff, which rose from 2,282 in 1895-96 to 3,737 in 1896-97, fell to 1,241 during the year under report. In re-vaccinations also there was a considerable decrease, the number operated upon being only 567 against 2,227 in 1896-97. The percentage of successful primary operations was 80.50 against 89.11 and of re-vaccination 52.91 against 64.53. Inspection work. 16. The inspection work of the officers of the Vaccination Department during 1897-98 as compared with the previous year is shown in the following table:4 The Native Supervisors inspected almost the same number of primary operations as in last year; in their inspection of re-vaccinations, however, there was a decrease of 20,402. The inspection work of the Divisional Inspectors was again very satisfactory, the number of primary vaccinations inspected by them rose from 104,719 in 1896-97 to 113,309 in 1897-98 and re-vaccinations from 21,323 to 55,251. Results of different kinds of lymph. 17. In the following table the results of the different kinds of lymph used during the year are contrasted with those obtained in 1896-97: Diagram showing the Death-rates from Small-pox per 10,000 of Population during the year 1897-98, the average rate of mortality from Small-pox per 10,000 of Population for the five years ending 1896-97, and the proportion of successful Vaccinations during the years 1881-82 to 1897-98, per 10,000 of Population in each District of the Punjab.

xii APPENDIX D. Annual Vaccination Report of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, for 1897-98. The office of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner. 1. The office of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner was held by Surgeon-Captain G. Y C. Hunter, with the exception of two days, from April 1st to June 6th. He officiated while Surgeon Captain James was on leave and on special plague duty at Bombay. The latter took over charge on April 3rd, and gave over charge on April 6th to proceed to Bombay. He again took over charge on June 7th, and remained in office for the rest of the year. Since October 21st he has been on special plague duty in the Jullundur district. Vaccinations performed by the special staff. 2. The Special Staff Vaccinators show, by their returns, that they have performed 103,135 vaccinations during the year, of which 72,031 were primary and 31,104 re-vaccinations. This is an increase on previous years, the increase being wholly in primary operations. There has been a decrease of 3,009 in re-vaccinations. The total results, if reliable, are satisfactory. But this year, owing to the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner being unavoidably so largely engaged on plague duty, there has not been the same supervision of the work as in previous years, and during the winter months, when most of the work is done, no inspections were made and con- sequently there has been little check on the returns sent in. There are reasons for believing that in many cases exaggerated returns have been submitted. For instance up till January the Vaccinators were using vaseline lymph as well as fresh calf lymph. In February the supply for reasons, which will be given later, entirely ceased. This, instead of causing a, diminution in the number of vaccinations performed, had the effect of producing an increase. That is to say, the Vaccinators were able to do more work with one source of lymph than with two sources. Again the largest number of vaccinations have been performed in out-of- the-way places which are difficult to inspect. The 23,617 operations in Chamba State by two Vaccinators raised suspicions. But on enquiry from the State Medical Officer, we were assured that the number was correct as vaccination had been made compulsory in the State, and State officials accompanied the Vaccinators in their work from village to village. However, we have not the same assurance from places like Bashahir and Sirmoor States, where the population is small, but a large number of operations were performed. The quality of the work seems to have improved. In primary operations 88.75 were successful as against 86.93 last year, and in re-vaccinations 69.07 as against 61.84 in the previous year. &quot; Unknown&quot; cases have, as usual, been reckoned with the &quot;unsuccessful&quot; ones. Kinds of lymph. 3. Three kinds of lymph have been used in the Provincexiii A total of 44,613 cases were vaccinated with vaseline lymph, 37,998 with animal lymph, and 20,525 with human lymph. The largest number of vaccinations were performed with stored lymph Fresh buffalo lymph appears to have given the best results in primary cases and human lymph in re-vaccinations. The stored lymph takes a lower position in pri- mary vaccinations giving 2.2 per cent. less successful results than human lymph and 3.5 less than fresh animal lymph, and in re-vaccination it gives 10 per cent. better results than fresh buffalo lymph which has a low rate of successes, and 3.5 percent. less successful results than human lymph. The differences are not very great, considering the fact that the vaseline lymph has often been kept some time before it is used. The power of the lymph at various times of year. 4. The following table (Table No. 2) gives the percentages of successful cases during each month of the year :xiv Inspections. 5. A very small number of inspections were made by the Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioner.This was due to the fact that he was on plague duty during seven months of the year under reference. The months in which he was able to do inspections happened to be the rainy season, and consequently he was unable to get to a large number of villages in the hills. September, as usual, was spent at Murree, preparing and sending out the annual supply of lymph to the plains. Table No. 4 gives the details of the inspections made. Table No. 4. Names of places.

The average cost of each successful vaccination was 3 annas 2 pies, being a decrease of 9 pies on the previous year. This decrease is mainly due to the saving in expenditure as well as the larger number of vaccinations performed. Changes. 7. There has been no change in the subordinate staff during the year. Punishments. 8. The punishments inflicted have been a little in excess of last year. The details are as follows :-xv The Amritsar Depôt. 11.

READ2 criminately and often within short periods of a successful primary operation having been effected, the result being an undue inflation of the returns and a false impression of the actual value of the work done by the Department. The increase of expenditure in recent years has been mainly due to the cost of the Civil Surgeons clerks being added to the outlay and to the entertainment of Divisional Inspectors of Vaccination and Registrars of Births and Deaths. In other respects the fluctuations in expenditure from year to year have been of the ordinary kind. Paragraphs 6 to 10.

In paragraphs 6 to 9 of his report the Officiating Sanitary Commis- sioner gives a summary of the work during the triennial period 1896-97 to 1898-99 The average results attained are noted above. Taking the figures for all the staffs year by year, a small but perceptible increase is observable in the percentages of success- ful results in primary vaccinations, while the same percentages for re-vaccinations fluctuated with a fall from 60.77 in 18-7-98 to 58.80 in 1898-99, Comparing: the year 1898-99 with the year 1897-98, which is the more immediate object of this review, it is found that in regard to primary operations which may be regarded as the chief work of the Vaccination staff there was an increase of 41,117 primary operations by the District staff, but in the other staffs there was a decrease which is specially noticeable in the case of the Special staff. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to observe the in- crease of operations performed by the District staff, but hopes with the Officiating Sanitary Commissioner (paragraph 24) for better results in future, and more especially in the districts mentioned in the margin of paragraph 12 of the report. In his report (Appendix E) on the working of the special staff during the year 1898-99 the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner gives various reasons for the falling-off in primary operations by that staff, and also for the decrease of re-vac- cinations which amounted to 16,362 as compared with 1897-98. Doubtless the absence of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner on plague duty, and the consequent want of supervision over the vaccinators, had much to do with this falling-off: perhaps also the partial change of system to working in bodies, to be referred to presently, instead of in pairs had something to do with it. Improvement, however, is clearly required, and the Lieutenant-Governor trusts that no efforts will be spared to attain this. Another point calling for notice and explanation is the decrease in the percentage of secondary successful cases which fell considerably in the cases of the Special and Cantonment staffs. The District staff fairly maintained the precentage of previous years, while the Dispensary staff showed an improvement amounting to 10.08. Paragraphs 11, 21 and 22. 3. In paragraph 2 of the review on the Vaccination Report for the year 1897-98 the very large falling-off in vaccinations was commented upon. Two causes put forward for the decrease were carelessness of the staff and inefficacy of the lymph prepared at the Vaccine Lymph Depôt. The Sanitary Commissioner was accordingly requested to submit a detailed report showing in what districts the carelessness occurred, in what it consisted, and to what circumstances the failure of the lymph was attributed, and how it affected the number of operations as opposed to the percentage of success attained in them. The end of the enquiry was unsatis- factory, as it failed to show the precise causes which had led to the decrease in work. It, however, pointed to a suspicion that a change in method might have had something to do with it. With regard to this, viz, a change in the system of work by the vaccinators, it may be briefly noted that in the year 1895 Brigade-Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel W. A. C. Roe, the Sanitary Commissioner of the day, in view to checking certain irregularities of the vaccinators, such as absenting themselves from their posts without leave, fudging returns to appear as though they had been on duty, and bad work, issued instructions for a change of system by which the men were to work in bodies under the immediate control of their native supervisors instead of
3 No. 145, dated 21st January 1898. No. 417, dated 18th October 1898. independently in pairs as hitherto. From this change of system Dr. Roe anticipated an increase in the number of operations, but it can hardly be said that his expectations have been realised. In its letters noted on the margin the Government of India observed that the &quot;new system introduced into the Province to secure more systematic work on the part of the operators would lead to a considerable increase in the number of operations has not been realised,&quot; and &quot;it would be instructive to know the reasons which have prevented it from succeeding. &quot; Reports as noted above were obtained from the Sanitary Department, but these not being conclusive, the Sanitary Commissioner was directed (letter No. 516, dated 14th April 1899) to supply information in his Report on Vaccination for the year 1898-99 showing how the system of working in bodies is pursued, and he was to give the Civil Surgeons' account of the actual method of working the system in each district, and consider what further instructions, if any, were required to put it on a proper footing. The information which the Sanitary Commissioner has collected is given in para- graph 2 of the Report. In paragraph 22 he observes that 22 Civil Surgeons are in favour of the vaccinators working together in bodies ; 5 are against it ; and 2 have not yet tried it. The Lieutenant-Governor, however, observes that a careful scrutiny gives the following results : 4 It was remarked by the Army Sanitary Commission in paragraph 7 of their Memorandum on the Sanitary Commissioner's Report for 1896 with reference to the objection that the vaseline lymph does not produce the foveated scar hitherto considered to be characteristic of genuine vaccination, that a few persons vaccinated with it should be subjected to the test of a subsequent operation performed with fresh calf or human lymph. The result of the experi- ments to be made on this suggestion is to be incorporated in the Vaccination Report for the current year. 5. Other causes assigned for the decrease in the number of operations call for little comment. Doubtless there is difficulty in procuring buffalo calves for purposes of direct vaccination : carelessness on the part of vaccinators, supervision by the Divisional inspectors which prevents trickery in the fudging of returns, an antagonism to vaccination by the people and excessive sickness from fever may also be accepted as being more or less causes of a decrease real or nominal in the returns ; but, as previously stated, the prevalence of small-pox cannot be admitted as a deterrent influence. Paragraph 14 (2), (4 and 5), (6 and 7) and (8) Paragraph 15. 6. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to observe that vaccination continues to meet with a fair measure of attention in the large Native States which employ their own vaccination establishment. In the frontier district of Kurram, under British management, there was a falling-off on the figures for 1897-98, amount ing to 816 in the case of primary vaccinations, but an increase of 315 in re-vaccinations. 7. During the year 1898-99 inspection work was carried out energetically. The amount of inspection work done by Civil Surgeons varied greatly in different districts. In Simla, Muzaffargarh, Gurdaspur and Jullundur more than 20 per cent. of primary vaccinations were inspected by the Civil Surgeons. The Civil Surgeons of Hoshiárpur and Lahore do not appear to have inspected a single case. Paragraph 19. Paragraph 20. 8. At the end of the triennial period ending with the year 1895-96 the Vaccination Act (XIII of 1889) was in force in 10 Municipal towns in the Punjab. At the close of the further triennial period ending with the 31st of March last this number had increased to 19. The Act is also in force in 10 cantonments. ORDER.TABLE OF CONTENTS. Para. Subject.

Dated LAHORE, the 1st July 1899. SIR, This being the triennial year, a full report on the working of the Vac- cination Department, Punjab, during the three years 1896-97, 1897-98 and 1898-99 is submitted in accordance with the order conveyed in Government of India letter No. 28-1529, dated 15th July 1887. Officers in charge of the Department. 2. From the commencement of the triennial period under report up to the 25th August 1897 Lieutenant-Colonel W. A. Crawford Roe was in charge of the Department; when he proceeded or three months' privilege leave, Lieutenant-Colonel C. J.

4 From the above statement it will be seen that taking the aggregate work performed by the four different agencies there was a satisfactory increase of 30,163 primary operations in 1898-99 over the figures of the previous year, but compared with those of 1896-97 there was a decrease of 11,141. Under the head of secondary operations there was a decrease of 34,786 as contrasted with the figures of 1897-98 and 50,404 with those of 1896-97. In the percentages of success both for primary and secondary operations there is very little varia- tion, although in primary vaccinations the percentage of successful cases has slightly increased during the past two years. Working of the District Staff during the triennial period. 8. I have nothing to add to the remarks made in previous reports regarding the work performed by the Special, Cantonment and Dispensary Staffs, but with regard to the working of the District Staff, I give a statement showing the total number of primary and secondary operations performed during the past three years in each district of the Province, and also the percentage of success :5 Special, Cantonment and Dispensary Staffs. 9. I give a similar statement showing the working of the Special Staff, the Cantonment Vaccination Staff and the Dispensary Staff: 6 Reasons (6) and (7), viz., carelessness on the part of the Vaccinators Greater efficiency in supervision by the Divisional Inspectors are good reasons also to account for the great diminution. A Vaccinator may now perform his work carelessly, but be very seldom fudges his returns as he used to do. It was an easy matter for a Vaccinator to increase his work by 50 or even 100 per cent. without being detected. Now, under the supervision of the Divisional Inspector they cannot do so, as they report all irregularities to the Sanitary Commissioner in their weekly diaries, and in several instances the Vaccinators have been very severely punished and degraded. The last reason, (8) antagonism to vaccination, is one which may be said to be general to a greater or less extent in every district of the Province, but which is gradually disappearing. Work of the District Staff in 1898-99. Rohtak. Ráwalpindi. Ferozepore. Bannu. Mooltan. Dera Ismail Khan. Shahpur. Dera Ghazi Khan. Jhelum. Muzaffargarh. 12. In 1898-99 the total Primary operations performed by the District Staff is 41,117 in excess of the past year and only 2,252 less than those performed in 1896-97. Taking the Province as a whole it may be said that the work performed in 1898-99 is satisfactory for, with few exceptions, every district in the Province shows an increase of work as compared with the past year, particularly the districts of Kángra, Umballa, Hoshiárpur, Hissár, Lndhiána, Dera Ismail Khan, Montgomery, Lahore, Gujrán- wála, Gujrát and Pesháwar. However, on comparing the figures of 1898-99 with the two previous years, it will be seen that there has been a very noticeable decrease in vaccination work in the marginally noted districts, while the districts of Hoshiárpur, Jhang, Lahore, Gujránwála and Peshawar show a marked increase. In the 16 remaining districts the number varies so slightly as to need no comment. Vaccination according to sex 13.

8 The degree of protection afforded from small-pox by the District Staff to infants under one year of age is, on an average, about 76 per cent., one year and under six, about 18, and above six, about one per cent. Vaccination in Native States. 15. The following statement shows the work performed during the three years in the large Native States which entertain their own vaccination establishments:9 I have very little to say about the Vaccination work performed in the Native States noted above as I exercise no control or supervision over the work of their Vaccination establishments, but a glance at this statement shows the relative amount of work done during these three years in each of these States. In Patiala State, while there is a decrease in Primary Vaccinations in 1897-98 and 1898-99 as compared with 1896-97, there is an increase in re- vaccinations ; so also in the States of Bahawalpur, Nabha, Jhind, Faridkot and Maler Kotla so far as Primary Vaccinations are concerned, but in Kapurthala there has been a slight increase in the Primary operations in 1898-99 and 1897-98 as compared with 1896-97. Establishment of Vac- cine Depôts. 16. There has been a great deal of correspondence on the subject of the establishment of suitable lymph depôts. With regard to the use of animal lymph preserved in vaseline, His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor observes (Punjab Government letter No. 731, dated 22nd April 1898), that &quot; in primary vaccinations the vaseline lymph has, on the whole, been less successful than either animal or human lymph, both in the hands of the ordinary and of the Special Staff, and though His Honor is open to conviction of the fact that this partial failure is due to unfavourable conditions in the preparation and use of the vaseline lymph, he is unable at present to regard this as proved. Under these circumstances His Honor observes that it will not be possible for him at present to consider proposals of the character put forward in letter No 3/109, dated the 8th of January 1897, from the Sanitary Commissioner to the address of the Punjab Government, involving considerable expenditure on buildings, apparatus, furniture and establishment, for the preparation of the new lymph; but invites such suggestions as to render it possible to give the lymph a fairer trial without committing Government to any large outlay on what must still be regarded in the light of an experiment.&quot; Action taken on order of Government. 17. On receipt of this letter the plans and estimate for the construction of two permanent depôts10 with the lymph ; and this fact may be taken as a proof that the system is sound, and that if properly managed the results would be as good as those obtained in England, Germany and many other countries on the continent of Europe. It has to be remembered that almost every Vaccinator in the province hates this system. It simply cuts away his profits when out in the villages, as if it is good he has only to take out his tubes, vaccinate there and then, and when finished go on to the next village. This, of course, is entirely against his principle, he cannot sit down, in a village, wait for calves to be brought, be fed free by the villages all this time, and also while the vaccine is maturing ; nor has he opportunities of fighting with lambardárs and others, and making complaints of obstruction to cover his failure to do work. Naturally, therefore, it is altogether to his interests to make the stored vaccine a failure as much as he possibly can, and it must be admitted that he has succeeded in many instances, and thus enabled those who oppose the system to call it &quot; only a partial success,&quot; and to wait for more favourable results before any pecuniary aid is given to perfect it. It is therefore of the highest importance to see that the vaccine is prepared under the best conditions, that it goes out in the tubes in a pure state, and if this is done, those vaccinators in whose hands it fails can then be marked down and REMOVED. For all these reasons, I consider the depôt should be located at Lahore in the cold season, under the immediate supervision of the superior officers of the Vaccination Depart- ment, when they are at head-quarters. The actual preparation of the lymph should be under the personal supervision of either a Military Assistant Surgeon or a VERY FIRST CLASS Native Assistant Surgeon. I again repeat that if success-is to be ensured, the vaccine must not be left to the Vaccinators to prepare. They are one and all against it for the reasons I have given, and because double the number of vaccinations can be performed with it in the same time. Consequently more work can be get out of the District Staff, and this they object to. With regard to the amount of money which the districts may be fairly supposed to contribute, I think the best way is, in the first instance, to ascertain what it has cost each district for calves, &c., during the last five years, and then to strike a fair average, and agree to supply each district with stored lymph for the same amount of money which it cost to procure calves in the villages. This could be tried as an experiment for two or three years, and as soon as the vaccinators began to understand that they must work with stored vaccine only, they would see how useless it was for them to go on opposing it; for any cases of marked failure should be carefully enquired into, and the delinquents prompt- ly dismissed if they did not explain fully, or amend their conduct. Proposed Scheme for supplying lymph to all districts. 18. On this note I worked out a scheme, for supplying lymph to all the districts in the Province, but as I could do nothing without the co-operation of the civil and medical authorities I drafted my proposals to them in the following terms :11 *1. Hissár. 11. Shahpur. 2. Rohtak. 12. Jhelum. 3. Gurgáon. 13. Hazára. 4. Karnál. 14. Kohát. 5. Simla. 15. Bannu. 6. Ludhiána. 16. D. I. Khan. 7. Jhang. 17. D. G. Khan. 8. Montgomery. 18.

What I propose to do is to ask for a fixed contribution from each district of the Province towards the maintenance of the depôt at Lahore, fixing Rs. 100 for the large districts of Gurdáspur, Amritsar, Lahore, Hoshiár- pur, Delhi, Ráwalpindi, Siálkot, Umballa, Jullun- dur, Mooltan, Ferozepore, Pesháwar and Kángra, and for the 18 smaller* districts Rs. 30 only. In other words Rs. 8-5-4 per mensem from the large districts and Rs. 2-8-0 from the smaller districts; the saving effected would be about Rs. 1,165 in the year, which is by no means a small amount.

12 I dropped taking further action in the matter and did not circulate the above letter after receipt of Punjab Government letter No. 410, dated 29th March 1899, directing: &quot;that some special officer should be appointed to still further report upon the success of animal lymph preserved in vaseline &quot; Captain E. Wilkinson, the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, in his Annual Report for 1898-99 (para. 16) has dwelt on this subject at some length, and has given a table showing the number of vaccinations performed in the different kinds of lymph, and the percentages of successes, and he finds, taking primary and re-vaccina- tions together that, buffalo lymph gives a percentage of 93.99 successful cases and vaseline vaccine of 92.22. I have, however, directed the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner to make further experiments during the next vaccinating season, and to submit a very full and clear report for the orders of Government. If Captain Wilkinson's report and experiments prove satisfactory, I think the plan I propose to make each district contribute a small sum annually towards the maintenance of the Depôts will be worth consideration. This subject will be dealt with separately. Extent of supervision exercised by the Officers of the Department. 19. The following statement shows the extent of supervision exercised by the Sanitary Commissioner and the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Civil Surgeons, Divisional Inspectors and Native Supervisors on the Vaccination Staff :13 Hissar.14 on tahsíl by tahsíl strictly in accordance with the instructions conveyed in Sanitary Commissioner's Office Circular No. II, dated 9th September 1895. The Karnál tahsíl was taken first, next Pánipat, and finally the Kaithal tahsíl. The villages allotted to each Vaccinator were in parallel lines irrespective of the Police stations or thánás in close proximity to one another, with such an arrangement that the Native Supervisor might have every facility to supervise and keep control on the working of his staff.&quot; Umballa 15 Vaccination done by the men in a body in this sense is the only way which will give good results.&quot; Ludhiana.16 instance, while one writes the names down, the other vaccinates. If each Vaccinator worked separately it is probable that a greater amount of work would be done, but the difficulty of supervision is increased.&quot; Jhang.17 office. Each pair of Vaccinators submits copy of his diary weekly, as also a statement showing the probable whereabouts and work for the following week. The Vaccinators work in pairs, but not much apart from each other, or in isolated parts of the district.&quot; Sialkot.18 my experience, means that one will do the work, while the other treats himself to French leave, or he wanders about on some other profitable excursion, and so vice versâ by which system they straggle all over, having shared certain portion of the district between themselves : so by this system they could not be under the supervision of the Native Supervisor, or Civil Surgeon, whereas the new system of working together had this advantage. (1) Portions of the district for working in were allotted from the Civil Surgeon's Office twice a month, by written orders, and Vaccinators were directed which way to travel, working one tahsíl at a time, guided by the map given to Native Supervisor for his guide. By these means the Civil Surgeon knows exactly where to find his men to check their work. (2) They being together were without excuse under control of the Native Supervisor, who could check their work without difficulty, and their weekly returns kept me informed how they were getting on, as these reports came through the Native Supervisor to Civil Surgeon's Office duly checked and signed, and certain fixed stations were told off, where the post would meet them with orders, and the post marked envelopes were kept by Native Superintendent to check dates of delivery of orders contained when any doubt was raised as to late delivery. (3) Of course, some slight directions were found necessary in the case of small villages of a few huts only. The directions in such instances were that the Vaccinators and the Native Supervisor move on to a central position where the village was larger than the others, and from these in two parties worked the small villages around, the Native Supervisor being helped in his responsibility by the next senior man to him. But in large towns and villages they worked together. The advantage of this was fixed responsi- bility with less chance of their meandering about, as their whereabouts were known to the Civil Surgeon, which they were aware of: then there was better work and with least risk for making false entries.&quot; Jhelum.19 Vaccinators who used to be dispersed in the whole district. Under the present system of working the Civil Surgeon can see what the Vaccinators are doing at any time when he likes. By the method of working in bodies is understood that the Vaccinators should commence work in a body at one part of the district usually from head-quarters, and go on working under the immediate Supervision of the Native Supervisor till they finish the whole district, while by working in pairs is understood that the Vaccinators be distributed in pairs at one time throughout the whole district, and go on working till each pair has finished the work of the part of the district alloted to them.&quot; D. I. Khan.20 on their conduct and work, the vaccine operations will be more efficiently done and in a large number, and the results better scrutinised than if they work in batches. I hope next year if I (Lalla Bhugwan Das) remain in charge of the district the vaccine operations will be done by zails, one after another, by Vaccinators going in a body in a zail, and each having a certain number of villages allotted to him in the zail for Vaccination with the Native Super- visor keeping his head-quarters in the centre of the zail to keep them under control and scrutinize the results and the returns will show the real success of the operations.&quot; Opinion of Sanitary Com- missioner. 22. It appears to me after perusal of Colonel Roe's Circular No. 11, dated 9th September 1895, ordering Vaccinators to work in bodies, that he did not mean all the Vaccinators to go to one or two villages, but that all the Vaccinators should work in one or two zails within a reasonable distance of each other so that the Native Supervisor could inspect their work. This has not been understood by all Civil Surgeons. Twenty-two Civil Surgeons are in favour of the Vaccinators working together in bodies, five are against it, and two have not yet tried it. In my opinion work- ing together systematically in bodies is the best way, and I propose that the work be carried out in this way for the future. Vaccination diagram. 23. The usual prescribed vaccination diagram is attached to this report, it shows clearly that in those districts, for instance Kangra, Simla, Dera Ghazi Khan, Hoshiarpur, Sialkote, where vaccination is fairly efficient and successfully performed, the mortality from small-pox has been very small compared with those districts where such is not the case. Cooclusion. 24. In conclusion I would remark that though there is some increase in the amount of primary vaccinations this year, still it is to be hoped that there will be a greater increase next year and that the number of re-vaccinations will be much increased. The importance of re-vaccination is often forgotten. Primary vaccination protects infants and young children but leaves the older generation unprotected or only partially protected. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, C. J. BAMBER, LT.-COL., I.M.S., Offg. Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab.

WILKINSON, I. M. S., Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, for the year 1898-99. 1. HAVE the honor to submit the Annual Vaccination Report of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, for the year 1898-99. The vaccination returns for this year have already been furnished you with my letter No. 247 of 15th April 1899. 2. In conformity with the established custom the returns furnished are for the twelve months ending on 31st March, when the vaccination season ends in the plains. 3. During the month of April, however, I inspected the work done by the Vaccina- tors in March, it will therefore be convenient if I refer to such work in this report. I shall do so in such a manner as not to complicate the returns. 4. The office of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, was held from the com- mencement of the year under report until 13th November by Captain C. H. James, I.M.S., and from that date onwards by Captain E. Wilkinson, I.M.S. Captain James was employed on plague duty until 7th September 1898, and Captain Wilkinson was similarly employed when he took over the duties of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, and continued so until 15th January 1899. The latter officer was absent on fifteen days' privilege leave from 24th January to 7th February 1899. 5. The work of the Vaccinators of the Special Staff for the year under report has been fairly satisfactory, though the number of vaccinations performed is less than in the previous year, and the percentage of successful vaccinations is not quite as high. It should be remarked, however, that in 1897-98 the number of vaccination was larger than in any previous year, and that in his report Captain James showed that there were reasons for believing that the Vaccinators had exaggerated their returns. The following table gives the number of vaccinations performed by the Special Staff for the last ten years:xiv 6. There has been a marked decrease in re-vaccinations, only 14,742 operations having been performed as compared with 31,104 in 1897-98, and 34,113 in 1896-97. With regard to re-vaccination I would draw attention to the remarks made on the subject by Captain James in his report for the year 1895-96. It had been found that a large number of unnecessary re-vaccinations had been performed in order to swell the returns, and stringent orders had been issued against indiscriminate re-vaccinations. This led to a marked fall in the number of re-vaccinations performed from 24,657 in 1894-95 to 17,597 in 1895-96. During the latter year further instructions were issued directing the Vaccinators to re-vaccinate wherever it was necessary, and reminding them of the Lieutenant-Governor's orders that a second vaccination was permitted seven years after the first. These instructions were followed by a very marked increase in the number of re-vaccinations returned, the number being 34,113 in 1896-97, nearly double of the previous year, and 31,104 in 1897-98. The number of re-vaccinations recorded this year, 14,742, is less than half the number returned last year. But it should be noted that during the year 1897-98 the Vaccinators of the Special Staff worked in the large Native Hill States where re-vaccination is more readily submitted to, and that in Chamba alone they performed, according to their returns, 17,444 re-vaccinations. I am inclined to believe, however, that even the figures returned for this year (14,742) are in excess of the actual number of operations performed. For there are considerable difficulties in the way of re-vaccination. Children of an age suitable for re-vaccination are largely em- ployed in agricultural work, tending cattle, and similar occupations which keep them in the fields and jungle often at some distance from their villages. They are thus difficult to reach, and may be safely trusted to place every obstacle they can in the way of the Vaccinators in addition to those offered by their parents. During the two and-a-half months that I have been inspecting vaccinations I have only been able to see 21, re- vaccinated children, though I saw over 5,000 vaccinated babies, while, it will be noticed, that the number of re-vaccinations returned for the year under report is nearly a quarter of that given for primary vaccination. The names of large numbers of children were entered in the Vaccinators' returns as having been re-vaccinated, but the children were almost invariably absent at my inspection, and I cannot avoid the suspicion that if these children could not be produced for the inspection of the &quot; Sáhib &quot; they were less likely to have been presented to the Vaccinators. It should be noted, however, that the large majority of re-vaccinations were performed in Native Hill States which I have not visited. 7. Several causes have been in operation during the year under report tending to diminish the work of the Special Staff. In the first place owing to the employment of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner on plague duty for the greater portion of the year, the Vaccinators were deprived of the incentive to the proper discharge of their duties afforded by periodical inspections of their work. There was considerable delay, also due to the- same cause, in dealing with certain cases of misconduct among the members of the Special Staff, and the services of a Native Supervisor and two Vaccinators were thus lost to the State for some months. The most marked decrease in the work of the Special Staff occurred during the hot weather when the Vaccinators were working in the small Hill States under the superintendence of the Deputy Commissioner of Simla. This decrease is largely attributable to a lack of assistance on the part of the authorities concerned, which has already been reported to you. (This office letter No. 2588 of 9th October 1898). The decrease of work during the month of October is attributable to the quarrels and misconduct of the Native Supervisor and Vaccinators working in the Bhera tahsíl of the Shahpur district. A further reference will be made to this matter under the head- ing, of &quot; punishments.&quot; During the month of November to February inclusive, there was an increase in, the number of vaccinations performed as compared with the corresponding months of last. year. In March there was a decrease, but this was due to a group of' Vaccinators having been sent from the plains to Sirmoor State, several days haying been occupied in this journey. 8. In accordance with your Circular No. 3, dated 20th April 1899, I subjoin some details on the subject of the working of the Vaccinators in bodies and in pairs. I would point out, however, that as there are only two Native Supervisors in the Special Staff while the 21 Vaccinators are divided into three groups a just comparison of the two methods cannot be made, as the advantage claimed for the method of the Vaccinators working in bodies is that the,Native Supervisors are better able to supervise the work of-the Vaccinators than if the latter were scattered in pairs. Moreover, the present year is, particularly unfavorable for instituting such a comparison, for one of the Native Super- visors was under suspension for five months, and the other was frequently sick and unable to perform his duties. For the purpose of making a comparison between the two methods the details of work done in the tahsíls of Bhera in the Shahpur District and of Chakwál in the Jhelum District, by the same group of Vaccinators is given below. These two tahsils are chosen, because of their similarity as regards the density of population. In the former tahsíl the, Vaccinators worked in a body as at first they had a Native Supervisor with them. In the Chakwál tahsíl the Native Supervisor having been suspended the Vaccinators worked in pairs. The results, as will be seen below, are that, on the average each Vaccinator did 10 vaccinations per day while they were working
xv in a body in the Bhera tahsíl, while when the Vaccinators worked in pairs in the Chakwál tahsíl each man did about 18 vaccinations daily:xvi only 17,289 vaccinations during the year, but one of these Native Supervisors, Ishar Dás, was under suspension for some months, and only made 4,475 inspections. The other Native Supervisor Behari Láll, reports that he inspected 12,814 operations. But in Thanesar tahsíl out of 75 villages, of which I have notes, the Native Supervisor had failed to inspect 41, probably more than this, and in the Jullundur tahsíl out of 51 villages I visited he had only inspected 12. This small amount of work on the part of Native Supervisor Behari Lál, is attributable to his age and infirmity. 10. The Special Staff has worked in the following 33 localities during the year under report, having been employed as usual in the hills during the hot months, and in the plains in the cold weather:xvii In addition to the above I inspected during the month of April the work done by the Special Staff in Jullundur city and tahsíl during the month of March with the following results :xviii chart. The result of human lymph have been excluded from this table, as this medium was only used during August 1898 and March 1899 : xix It is interesting to note in comparing this chart with a similar one given in last year's report that the vaseline vaccine paste gives the best results in January, reaching the same figure, 94.5 per cent., in both yearsxx Medical Officer, 24th Gurkha Rifles ... ... ... ... ...

Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in the Home (Medical and Sanitary) Department, No. 707 S., dated 30th July 1900. READ2 being afforded to the Vaccinators by the collection of families at the relief camps. In the Districts of Umballa, Hoshiárpur and Gujrát the decrease in work amounted in each case to over 5,000 vaccinations. The great decrease of 9,070 in the Umballa District was due to a falling-off of 9,020 in re-vaccinations, which shows that attention is being paid to orders it was found necessary to issue in past years prohibiting indiscriminate re-vaccination. In other cases also the falling-off was due to the same cause : also to famine-stricken persons leaving their homes in search of a livelihood. Paragraph 9. 5. The increase of work in the Cantonment Staff in both primary and re-vaccinations was also satisfactory. Paragraph 10. 6. The Special Staff performed 75,273 primary vaccinations, this being the highest number yet recorded to its credit in any one year. Its work was also good on the whole. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to observe that the returns submitted by the Vaccinators are believed to be more reliable than in previous years. Paragraph 11. Paragraph z6. 7. Kángra, which is the best vaccinated district in the Province, enjoyed complete immunity from small-pox throughout the year 1899-1900. Pesháwar, the least vaccinated district, had a severe attack, 2,288 deaths having been registered from the disease. In this district the people are averse to vaccination, and the re- prehensible practice of inoculation is common. In Gurgaon, which stands about midway with the other districts of the Province in respect to the proportion of suc- cessfully vaccinated population, small-pox is attributed to opposition to vaccination in the town of Rewári. His Honor observes with regret that the members of the Municipal Committee are among the obstructionists, and trusts that the active measures being taken to overcome this opposition may bear good fruit. He quite thinks that the appointment of a man of good caste and tact, such as Rái Bahádur Bál Kishen, might be productive of much good, if opposition is really strong. The statistics, however, of operations on children for the past year in the Gurgaon District are not unsatisfactory. Paragraph 13. 8. Inspection work taken as a whole was carried out vigorously. It is satisfactory to note that the efforts of the Divi- sional Inspectors in this direction have largely prevented the falsifying of returns by the Vaccinators. Paragraphs 14 and 15. 9. Owing to his deputation on plague duty, Captain Wilkinson, Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, was unable to complete a series of experiments he had received orders to undertake with a view to ascertain the degree of protection conferred by vaccin- ation with vaseline vaccine paste. The result of what little he was able to do is, however, encouraging. The further experiments suggested by the Sanitary Commissioner should be carried out. 10. Vaccination continued to receive attention in those Native States which keep up their own Vaccination Staff. In Baháwalpur and Máler Kotla the perhaps unprece- dented result of 100.00 per cent. of success in re-vaccinations was attained. The 'numbers, however, re-vaccinated were small. In the British District of Kurram the percentage of successful results fell off as compared with the year 1898-99 from 98.09 to 93.69 in primary cases, and from 84.67 to 62.39 in re-vaccinations. Paragraph 18. 11. In accordance with orders received from the Government of India, the Sanitary Commissioner furnishes statistics of the incidence of vaccination on children in towns. The figures as might be expected go to show that as a general rule vaccination is
3 not so much resorted to in towns where the Act is not in force as it is in towns where the Act is in force. It may, however, be said that the Municipal Com- mittees of the larger towns in the Punjab are gradually realizing the desirability of the provisions of Act XIII of 1880 (The Vaccination Act) being extended to their Municipalities. In regard to the smaller towns a certain discretion has to be exercised, as a suitable staff is not always at hand to ensure the provisions of the Act (being carried out with sympathetic and appreciative regard to the feelings of the people. It is not desirable that the Act should be administered with severity. ORDER.TABLE OF CONTENTS. Para. Subject. Page. 2 Administration ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

No. FROM LIEUTENANT-COLONEL C. J. BAMBER, I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, To H. A. CASSON, ESQUIRE, C. S., Judicial and General Secretary to the Government, Punjab. Dated LAHORE, 30th June 1900. SIR, I have the honour to submit, for the information of His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, the Returns of Vaccination in the Punjab for the year 1899-1900, with the following remarks. Administration. 2. I was in charge of the Department throughout the year. Captain E. Wilkinson, I.M.S., held the office of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner. He was on plague duty from the 19th July to the 18th August at Malot Satian in the Ráwalpindi district. From the 4th November 1899 he proceeded on three months privilege leave, and I carried on his duties in addition to my own. Strength of the vaccina- tion establishtment. 3. The strength of the vaccination establishment was as follows : 2 The total expenditure in 1899-1900 was Rs. 1,00,224 as compared with Rs. 1,00,345 in 1898-99, or a decrease of Rs. 121 only. The variations under each head are so small that they call for no explanation. The number of vaccina- tions performed by different establishments. 5. The general results of vaccination as compared with the previous year are shown in the following statement: 3 The Staff performed 68,618 more primary and 17,697 more secondary opera- tions than in the previous year, and the percentage of success was slightly better. Vaccination work. 7. There was a most notable increase in the Vaccination work in the Hissár district, the increase being 31,959. This increase is due to the people being collected in famine camps. The districts of Kángra, Delhi, Mooltan, Jhang, Gurdáspur, Shahpur, Ráwal- pindi and Dera Ismail Khan, also show a very satisfactory increase. In only eight districts, viz., Umballa, Karnál, Hoshiárpur, Montgomery, Amritsar Gujrát, Gujránwála and Muzaffargarh was there a decrease, as will be seen from the following statement: 4 With regard to the cause of decrease in these districts the Civil Surgeons of four districts only, viz., Umballa, Montgomery, Karnál and Muzaffargarh, report as follows:5 are under the impression that Vaccination work does not form part of their legitimate duties as there is a a separate Department for the purpose, and like most persons they do not care to perform work for which they are not paid. Work of the Canton- ment Staff. 9. The work performed by the Cantonment Staff during the year is very satisfactory, 6,248 primary and 3,603 re-vaccinations against 4,419 and 1,373 in the previous year. 1899-1900. 1898-1899. 1899-1900. 1898-1890 Number of primary vacinations. Percentage of success. Number of primary vaccinations. Percentage of success. Number of re-vaccina- tion. Percentage of success. Number of re-vaccina- tion. Percentage of success. 6,248 95.52 4,419 93.51 3,603 76.41 1,373 73.93 The Annual Returns show that there are ten cantonments with a population of 196,058 and a Staff of seven Vaccinators. The work in the Pesháwar Cantonment is done by the District Staff. The average num- ber of operations performed by each Vaccinator was 1,407 as compared with 3,066, the average number performed by a District Staff Vaccinator. This small outturn of work is doubtless due to the shifting nature of the canton- ment population and to the preponderance of the male over the female popula- tion, 2,739 births only were registered in the cantonments during the year 1899- 1900 giving a birth-rate of 13.98. Work of the Special Staff. 10. The work of the Special staff in primary vaccination has been satisfactory 6 The quality of the work of the Special Staff, as judged by the percentages of suc- cessful cases, has slightly improved, the total percentage of success being 8264 as com- pared with 82.58 of last year. This improvement is, however, confined to re-vaccinations, of which the percentage of success has risen from 56.83 to 62.38, while the percentage of successful primary vaccination has fallen from 88.68 to 86.40. The variations in these figures have been due more to differences in the number of operations whose results are returned as unknown than to any real alteration in the quality of the work. Small-pox map. 11. I attach a map to this report showing the death-rates from small-pox in the different districts of the Province. The death-rates by districts are noted in the margin of the map and the shades of brown color indicate the districts which have a low or a high death-rate. Kángra and Simla, it will be seen, show complete immunity from the disease, while 26 districts give a rate varying from 0.05 to 0.50. Gurgáon and Kohát give roughly a death-rate of 1.00, while Pesháwar gives a rate of 3.50. The Civil Surgeons of Pesháwar, Kohat and Gurgáon report as follows regarding the high mortality from this disease in their respective districts:Diagram showing the death-rates from Small-pox per 10,000 of population during the year 1899-1900, the average rate of mortality from Small-pox per 10,000 of population for the five years ending 1898-99 and the proportion of successful Vaccinations during the years 1881-82 to 1899-1900 per 10,000 of population in each District of the Punjab.

The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner inspected 2,205 and the percentage of successes was 95.74. The Civil Surgeons of the 31 districts in the Province inspected 67,760 primary and 12,372 re-vaccinations as compared with 42,876 and 6,050 in the previous year, or nearly double the number inspected in 1898-99. The greatest number of inspections were made by the Civil Surgeons of Gurdáspur, Mooltan, Siálkot, Ferozepore, Jullundur, Hoshiárpur and Jhang. Statement No. V gives in detail the amount of inspections done by the different supervising officers and the per- centages of success. The inspection work of the Divisional Inspectors and the 34 Native Supervisors is very satisfactory. I would remark here that owing to such thorough inspection the fudging of returns by Vaccinators has been reduced to such a minimum that only two reports of irregular work were brought to my notice this year. Different kinds of lymph. 14. The following statement compares the results of the different kinds of lymph used with those in 1898-99:8 pitted appearance which some people maintain as the test of a good scar and efficient protection. In compliance with the instructions contained in your letter No. 720 R., of April 19th, 1899, I commenced some experiments in September last year with a view to ascertain the degree of protection conferred by vaccination with vaseline vaccine paste. I had intended to complete these experiments during the past cold weather, but my having been ordered on plague duty almost immediately on return from leave has prevented my doing so. I should have preferred to complete the investigation before making any report on them ; but in compliance with the directions of His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, forward- ed with your letter above quoted, I am including in this report the results of such experi- ments as I have made. Taking the production of unmodified vesicles by a second vaccina- tion in children primarily vaccinated one year previously as a test of the efficacy of the primary vaccination, I re-vaccinated on September 12th, 1899, 25 children who had been previously vaccinated with vaseline vaccine paste on September 16th, 1898, using for dif- ferent children human and buffalo lymph and vaseline vaccine paste. Three insertions were made in each case. I inspected the children on 17th and 18th September 1899 when three were absent, and are excluded from consideration. The results are shown in the subjoined table and may be thus epitomised. Of the 22 children inspected 13 showed no results whatever, two showed doubtful marks, three showed modified marks, and four unmodified marks. All the children were carefully examined before being re-vaccinated and the results of the primary vaccination noted. Of the four children in whom re-vac- cination produced unmodified marks, two had well pitted primary scars and two had scars only slightly pitted. The percentage of success judging by the ordinary vaccination standard amounted to 17.39. The insertion success was only 14.49. Three of the 9 Captain Wilkinson's results as to the foveation of the scars from vaseline vaccine are what I have always found in my own inspections. Non-foveation shows that excessive scarring has been caused by the application of too much vaccine or lymph, and may occur when vaseline vaccine or fresh lymph is used. With regard to the experiments to prove that vaseline vaccine is pro- tective, Captain Wilkinson was unable to do more than make so few experiments as to prove nothing. These experiments should be carried out again this year, and the inter- val between the two periods of vaccination should be much less than a year, say four months. The experiments might with advantage be made on animals too. It is known that there are persons who can be re-vaccinated after a year with a successful result. If the supposition is true that vaseline vaccine is not pro- tective then re-vaccination with fresh lymph should be successful immediately. Control experiments should be made by vaccinating with fresh lymph, and then re-vaccinating with the same, this would show in what percentage of cases a successful re-vaccination takes place even in the case of fresh lymph.

Only the Civil Surgeons- of Hoshiárpur and Kohát did not carry out the instructions conveyed in this office Circular No. 5 of 1899 for making the Vaccinators work in bodies. In the Hoshiárpur District the instructions as to working in bodies were only partly carried out. In Kohát the prevalence of small-pox kept the Vaccinators scattered, Hoshiarpur.14 Kohat.A.ii A.iii DEPARTMENT. in the Punjab Province during the year 1899-1900. 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 2 PRIMARY VACCINATION.

Statement No. IIIvii Comparative Statement No. IV.vii Statement No. V.APPENDIX A. Annual Vaccination Report by CAPTAIN E. WILKINSON, I.M.S., Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, for the year 1899-1900. The appointment of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner has been held by Captain E. Wilkinson, I.M.S., throughout the year, but this officer was on three months' privilege leave from November 4th. 1899, to February 4th, 1900, while his duties were carried on by Lieutenant-Colonel C. J. Bamber, I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, in addition to his own. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner was employed on plague duty from July 19th to August 18th, 1899, inclusive, and again from February 13th to the end of the year under report. The work of the Special Staff has been more satisfactory this year than it was last, a larger number of vaccinations having been performed and a higher proportion of per- centages of success attained. The increase in number of operations performed is confined to primary vaccination, there having been a slight falling off in re-vaccinations as compar- ed with the last year. The number of primary vaccinations performed during the year was 75,273, the highest number yet recorded by the Special Staff. This is over 12,000 in excess of the number of primary vaccinations performed in 1898-99. It also exceeds by more than 3,000 the number of primary operations performed during 1897-98, when the number of operations recorded exceeded by nearly 5,000 those of any previous years, and when, as has been mentioned in previous reports, there were reasons for believing that the vaccinators had exaggerated their returns. This year, however, I think, the returns are fairly accurate. The decrease in re-vaccinations is but small, the number of operations performed, 13,969, being only 773 less than that of last year. The subject of re-vaccina- tion having been noticed at some length in my last year's report calls for no special remark here. I attribute the increase in the amount of work done partly to the distribu- tion of the vaccinators into two groups instead of into three as formerly. There are only two Native Supervisors in the special staff, and consequently in for- mer years one group of vaccinators was without direct supervision ; while now all the vaccinators work directly under Native Supervisors. Besides this the large amount of vaseline vaccine paste issued to the Special Staff has enabled the vaccinators to work more quickly, and I think that a system I recently introduced requiring the vaccinators to sub- mit their naqshas alif to me monthly has had beneficial results. The vaccinators have worked in groups of pairs, i.e., all the vaccinators of a group work in a zail, thus being in touch with their Native Supervisor, and in the zail two vaccinators have worked together, this having been found the most economical way. The quality of the work of the Special Staff, as judged by the percentages of suc- cessful cases, has slightly improved, the total percentage of success being 82.64 as com- pared with 82.58 of last year. This improvement is, however, confined to re-vaccinations, of which the percentage of success has risen from 56.83 to 62.38, while the percentage of successful primary vaccination has fallen from 88.68 to 86.40. The variations in these figures have been due more to differences in the number of Operations whose results are returned as unknown than to any real alteration in the quality of the work. The Native Supervisors of the Special Staff have done much more work this year than last, having made 32,884 inspections or 36.85 per cent. of the vaccinations performed as compared with 17,289 inspections or 22.47 per cent. last year. The improvement is due to the change in the staff. The vaccinators of the Special Staff have worked during the year in the following localities having been employed as usual in the hills in the hot weather and in the plains during the cold months : -Zafarwal, Nowshera, Abbottabad, Jullundur, Phillour, Murree, Pesháwar, Mardán, Wazírabad, Fázilka, Thánesar, Dasúya, Gurgáon, Rewári, Alipur and Jagádhri tahsils, and Kálka town and Mandi, Suket, Bushá- hir Sirmoor, Ghomarsain and Keonthal States. The average cost of each successful vaccination performed this year amounted to annas three and pies ten, i.e., nine pies less than last year. The decrease in cost is prin- cipally due to the larger number of operations performed. There has also been a slight decrease in expenditure from Rs. 18,043 to Rs. 17,750-3-2, which is mainly due to the pay of the present Deputy Sanitary Commissioner being less than that of his predecessor.
ii The following changes have occurred in the Spècial Staff during the year:iii It would appear from this table that the work of the Special Staff compared un- favourably with that of the District and Cantonment Staffs. It will be noticed, however, that I only inspected primary vaccinations performed by the District Staff, and that the number of inspections I made of the work of the Cantonment Staff is too small to be of any use for comparison. I explained in my last year's report the causes of the apparent discrepancy between the result of my inspections and those reported by the vaccinators. The results of the different kinds of lymph used by (the Special Staff vaccinators during the year are shown in the subjoined table, from which those operations whose re- sults are unknown are excluded :iv Table shewing the results of vaseline vaccine paste month by month for the past three years :v obtained by human and one by buffalo lymph. In the absence of similar experiments with human, buffalo or other lymphs the experiment here described furnishes no definite conclusion as to the value of vaseline vaccine paste compared with these lymphs. Table showing results of re-vaccination of children one year after they had been vaccinated with vaseline vaccine paste. The children were vaccinated with vaseline vaccine paste on September 16th 1898, and were re-vaccinated, each with three insertions, with the different lymphs shown below on September 12th 1899, and were inspected by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner on September 17th and 18th 1899&quot; : vi The annual supply of lymph of three ten grain tubes was despatched on 23rd Sep- tember, 1899, from Murree to all Civil Surgeons in the Punjab. All gave successful results, except two sent to the Civil Surgeon, Hoshiárpur, which were broken in transit. In addition to casual indents a regular supply of vaseline vaccine paste was sent to the vaccinators of the special staff throughout the year, and, during the winter months, to the Civil Surgeons of the following districts : vii Superintendent, Mung Rasúl Jail ... ... ... ... ...

FROM LIEUTENANT-COLONEL C. J. BAMBER, I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, To H. A. CASSON, ESQUIRE, C.S., Judicial and General Secretary to Government, Punjab, Dated LAHORE, 1st July 1901. SIR, I have the honor to submit the prescribed vaccination statements for the year 1900-01 with the following brief remarks. Number of vaccinations performed by different es- tablishments. 2. In Statement No. 1 are given the vaccinations performed by the District Vaccination Staff, the Special Staff, the Cantonment Staff, and the Dispensary Staff. The aggregate number of operations performed by all establishments. 3. The results for the year show that the aggregate number of operations performed by all establishments was 782,496, being a decrease of 160,578 as compared with the number vaccinated in the previous year. This is accounted for by the decrease of 150,031 births this year and also by the fact that in the previous year very many more vaccinations were performed than the average of the years 1898-1899. Of the total operations performed 627,754 were primary and 154,742 re-vaccinations. Of the primary vaccinations 592,824 were successful and 97,544 of re-vaccinations. The percentage of success for primary vaccinations was 94.44 and for re-vaccinations 63.04. Total number of opera- tions performed by sex and Age. 4. Among males and females 430,945 and 351,551 respectively were vac- cinated. Of the total successful primary vaccinations, 462,392 were performed upon infants under one year of age, 118,918 upon those over one and under six years, and 11,514 upon children of the age of six years and over. The number successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population was 33.27 against 39.96 in the preceding year, or a decrease of 6.69. Strength of the vaccina- tion establishment. 5. The strength of the vaccination staff of the year was nearly the same as that employed in the previous year, viz., 6 Divisional Inspectors, 34 Native Supervisors, 40 1st class Vaccinators, 78 second class Vaccinators, and 184 third class Vaccinators, or a total of 302 Vaccinators as compared with 303 last year. Cost of department. 6. The aggregate cost of the Department amounted to Rs. 1,01,539 as compared with 1,00,224 in 1899-1900, an increase of Rs. 1,315 only, which was chiefly under the head of travelling allowance of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner and the Special Staff. Work of the district staff. 7. The Vaccinators of the District Staff performed .692,666 vaccina- tions, i.e., 555,031 primary, 137,635 re-vaccinations; of the primary vaccinations 95.49 per cent. were successful and of re-vaccinations 64.02 per cent. The decrease in the number of vaccina- tions performed by this staff, as compared with the previous year, was 150,564, and is most noticeable in the districts of Hissár, Rohtak, Karnál, Umballa, Ferozepore, Lahore, Gurdáspur, and Siálkot. This decrease is ascribed to the following causes and was to be expected. In Hissár, Rohtak, and Karnál, it is ascribed (1) to the high mortality and sickness amongst children and to a small birth-rate, (2) to the return to the Native States of all poor families who were working in the famine camps, and (3) to the difficulty of procuring buffalo calves in the villages for vaccination purposes, owing to the great mortality among the cattle.
2 With regard to the decrease in the Umballa District, Captain James, I. M. S., says &quot; that the number of operations performed this year (1900-1901) is less than half of that for the previous year but the decrease is due to the causes over which we had no control. The vaccinations performed in the pre- vious two years (1898-1899 and 1899-1900) were abnormally large compared with the former years and were represented by figures much larger than the registered births in the district for those years and therefore probably repre- sented, in a large measure, work left undone in former years. I mean by this that; many vaccinations must have been performed on children over one year, who ought therefore to have been vaccinated in the previous years. It was therefore not to be expected that such high figures as 51,617 and 42,547 vaccinations in those years could be expected to continue. I think therefore those figures must represent arrears of work, especially as the births registered for those years were only 36,952 and 29,821.&quot; The reports of the majority of the Civil Surgeons who have remarked on the cause of decrease of vaccination work in their respective districts may be summed briefly as due to (1) the excessive scarcity at the beginning of last year rendering children unfit for vaccination and (2) the excessive rainfall and the consequent increase in malarial fever towards the end of the year, (3) the low birth-rate. This latter cause in itself would tend to materially diminish the number of children available for vaccination. The mortality during the year under review was much greater than any year since 1892, the season was so unhealthy that the vaccinators were often obliged to refrain from vaccinating children brought to them, as they were found to be suffering from fever, enlarged spleen, malarial cachexia, which rendered the operation of vaccination inadvisable. Work of the Special Staff. 8. Special Staff.3 the table given in Appendix C. It will be noticed that both in primary and re- vaccination the results of glycerine lymph compare unfavourably with those of vaseline vaccine paste. It should be noticed however that the Vaccinator who prepared the glycerine lymph had no previous experience in its manufacture or the Vaccinators who used it in its application. Further the lymph was manufactured under the most unfavourable conditions and without any of the appliances or convenience in use for its manufacture in Europe. These latter, in accordance with the sanction accorded by Punjab Government in November 1900, have been indented from England, and it is hoped that they will be available for use at the beginning of the next cold weather.&quot; Protective efficiency of the vaseline vaccine paste. 14. Captain Wilkinson was unable to continue and complete the investigation into the protection afforded by vaseline vaccine paste (the commencement of which he described in his last year's report) owing to his employment on plague duty. I did not carry on these experiments as they were proposed to test the vaseline paste which had been first made and introduced by me. Unless Captain Wilkinson is relieved of his duties as Chief Plague Medical Officer this winter or another officer is appointed as Deputy Sanitary Commissioner the investigation will have to be again postponed. Extension of the Vac- cination Act. 15. During the year under report the Compulsory Vaccination Act was extended to the following towns:Diagram showing the death-rates from Small-pox per 10,000 of population during the year 1900-1901, the average rate of mortality from Small-pox per 10,000 of population for the five years ending 1899-1300 and the proportion of successful Vaccinations during the year 1900-1901 and the preceding six years in each District of the Punjab.

Proceedings of the Hon'ble the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in the Home (Medical and Sanitary) Department, No. 1103 S., dated 30th July 1902. READ2 6. The causes of the decrease in vaccination operations have already been stated in paragraph 2 of the Review by the Lieutenant-Governor on the Vaccina- tion Report for the year 1900-01. Briefly, they have been a decrease in the number of births, scarcity, malarial fever, mortality among cattle which has made it difficult to get buffalo-calves, return of persons to the Native States who had sought refuge in our famine camps, and the employment of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner and of Vaccinators on plague duty, to which in the case of the year 1901-02 may be specially added unusual sickness, which rendered a number of children unfit for vaccination, and the continued existence and disastrous spread of plague in the Province, and in the principal Native States, which caused a suspension of vaccination operations in certain badly- infected tracts, where, the people being in a disturbed frame of mind, it was thought the presence of Vaccinators might lead to trouble. The Lieutenant- Governor, however, agrees with the Sanitary Commissioner that the plague- infected parts of the Province cannot be left unprotected against small-pox, and he desires that an effort should be made to carry on vaccination in the infected places during the coming cold weather. The disability that the Department has suffered under from the employment of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner on plague duty having now been removed by the appointment of Lieutenant W. F. Harvey, M.B., as a whole-time officer to that post, the Lieutenant-Governor hopes to see an improvement in vaccination results generally. 7. The Vaccination Act was not extended to any town during the year 1900-01. With reference to the remarks in paragraph 3 of the letter from the Government of India in the Home Department, No. 1926, dated the 18th of October 1901, to the effect that strenuous efforts should be made towards the improvement of vaccination in towns, the Lieutenant-Governor observes from paragraph 28 of the present Report that the matter is engaging the attention of the Sanitary Commissioner. It should not be lost sight of. 8. With reference to the remarks in paragraph 39 of the Report as to the relative merits of vaccination performed with vaseline vaccine paste and animal lymph, the Lieutenant-Governor will be glad to receive the further remarks of the Sanitary Commissioner after the paste has been tried under more favour- able circumstances than seem to have presented themselves in the trial in the Miánwáli District. 9. As regards the remarks in paragraph 29, the Lieutenant-Governor regrets that it has not yet been found possible to carry out the instructions of the Government of India in regard to a trial of glycerinated lymph. The remarks in paragraph 15 as to the failure of this lymph in the Ráwalpindi Dis- trict are not very encouraging, but now that the Department has again a whole- time Deputy Sanitary Commissioner and the necessary apparatus at its disposal, the trial ordered by the Government of India should be undertaken without further delay. 10. Consequent on the employment of Captain Wilkinson, I.M.S., on plague work, Lieutenant-Colonel C. J. Bamber, I.M.S., was almost without assistance in supervising the work of the Department throughout the year. The inspection work performed by himself and by such of the Civil Surgeons as were not prevented from attending to the duty from causes beyond their control and by other officers of the Department appears to have been satisfactory. The Vaccination Department has sustained a severe loss in the death of the late Rái Bahádur Pandit Bál Kishen, who had been connected with it from the time of its formation. He possessed great personal influence, and it may be safely said that his success in Kángra has practically stamped small-pox out of that district.

FROM LIEUTENANT-COLONEL C. J. BAMBER, I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, To C. J, HALLIFAX, ESQUIRE, C. S., Judicial and General Secretary to the Government, Punjab. Dated LAHORE, the 1st July 1902. SIR, I have the honor to submit, for the information of His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, the following triennial Report on Vaccination in the Punjab for the year 1901-02. Administration. 2. I was in charge of the Vaccination Department throughout the year. Captain E. Wilkinson, I.M.S., the Deputy Sanitary Com- missioner, was employed as Chief Plague Medical Officer during the year, and had, therefore, very little time to devote to the supervision of vaccination work. Exclusion of the Statis- tics of frontier districts from the returns. 3. In compliance with the instructions conveyed in your letter No. 1717, dated the 20th December 1901, the figures for the districts and tahsils transferred to the North-West Frontier Pro- vince are excluded from the prescribed Statements attached to this report, and those for the newly formed district of Miánwáli incor- porated in them. The population given in the returns is according to the census of 1901. Revision of Vaccination Establishment. 4. During the year 1901-02 the District Vaccination Staff was regraded. Instead of the two classes of Native Supervisors on Rs. 40 and Rs. 30 per mensem, three grades at Rs. 55, Rs. 35 and Rs. 25 per month were substituted. With regard to Vaccinators, the three grades of Rs. 15, Rs. 12 and Rs. 10 were redistributed in four grades of Rs. 20, Rs. 15, Rs. 12, and Rs. 10 per mensem. The new scheme was sanctioned by the Punjab Government in their Resolution No. 885, dated 26th June 1901, and brought into force on the 1st September 1901. Strength of the Vacci- nation Establishment. 5. The strength of the Vaccination Establishment till the 1st Septem- ber 1901 consisted of 5 Divisional Inspectors, 35 Native Supervisors, including one Inspector in the Kangra district, and 302 Vaccinators. From that date there were 5 Divisional Inspectors, 33 Native Supervisors and 283 Vaccinators. After the 9th November 1901, when the North-West Frontier Province was formed, there remained 3 Divisional Inspectors, 27 Native Supervisors, and 258 Vaccinators, the remaining 2 Divisional Inspectors, 6 Native Supervisors and 25 Vaccinators were handed over to form the Vaccination Establishment of the new province. Rái Bahádur Pandit Bálkishen, who for many years did excellent work as Inspector of Vaccination in the Kángra District, died in September 1901. His death has been a great loss to the Department. Cost of Establishment, Statement No. IT. 6. In 1900-01 the cost of the vaccination establishment amounted to Rs. 101,539 or Rs. 1,315 more than in the previous year. In 1901-02, owing to the changes in the staff referred to in the preceding paragraph, the expenditure amounted to Rs. 92,045. The details of the cost under principal heads were as follows: 2 Average cost per success- ful case. Statement No. II. 7. During the year 1901-02, the average cost per successful case was annas two and pies seven. Aggregate number of operations performed by all establishments. State- ment No. I. 8. There was a considerable falling off in the aggregate number of vaccine operations in 1900-01, as compared with the previous year. In 1901-02, the year under immediate notice, there was a further decrease. Excluding, for the purpose of comparison, the figures for the newly constituted district of Miánwáli from the returns for 1901-02, and those of the frontier districts transferred to the new Province from the statements of the previous two years, the total vaccinations of the triennial period amounted in 1899-00 to 869,831, in 1900-01 to 713,951, and in 1901-02 to 658,950. The corresponding figures in the previous three year period, 1896-97 to 1898-99, were 833,211, 790,055, and 781,651, respectively. There was thus a decrease of 162,185 operations during the triennial period under notice, of which about one-third was in primary vaccinations and two- thirds in re vaccinations. The figures for 1900-01 and 1901-02, however, do not compare so unfavourably with those of 1897-98 and 1898-99 as they do with the number vaccinated in 1899-00. The decrease in the last two years was due mostly, as will be presently noticed, to causes over which the department had no control. Total vaccinations ac- cording to sexes. 9. Of the total of 668,144 vaccinations in 1901-02, there were 369,550 among males and 298,594 among females. Kángra is the only district in which more operations were performed on the female than on the male population. The reason for this is, I believe, that the people of Kángra do not object to young girls being revaccinated so much as in other parts of the Province. Decrease in the work of the District Staff in 1900- 01 and 1901-02. 10. The District Staff.3 Districts with the largest increase in the work of the District Staff. 11. The districts with the largest increase in the work done by the District Staff in 1901-02 as compared with the previous year, were Ráwalpindi, Simla, Hissár and Muzaffargarh. Excluding the last named district, the increase was in revaccinations. Decrease in primary vaccinations by the Dis- trict Staff. 12. There was a total of 442,598 primary vaccinations (excluding Miánwáli) performed by the District Staff in 1901-02 against 490,357, the corresponding figure in 1900-01, showing a decrease of 47,759. Of this decrease, nine thousand each, in round numbers, took place in Gurdáspur and Lahore, six thousand each in Ludhiána and Umballa and five thousand in Jullundur. So that about three-fourth of the total decrease took place in these five plague infected districts. Revaccinations by the District Staff. 13. Of the total vaccinations done by the District Staff in 1901-02 there were 139,098 secondary operations. In the district of Kángra as many as 51,940 revaccinations were done. In the district of Mooltan the number revaccinated was 16,279 ; in Ráwalpindi 11,536, and in Gurdáspur 9,090. In the districts of Rohtak, Gurgáon, Umballa, Ferozepore and Miánwáli, the District Staff did very little revaccination work. Successful cases accord- ing to ages. 14. Out of a total of 451,689 primary cases in 1901-02, the number of successful cases was 430,958, of which 351,945 were among infants under one year, 73,344 among children between one and under six years, and 5,669 among those of the ages of 6 and over 6 years. The proportion of successful operations among infants under one year to total number of successful cases was 82 per cent. Amount of success in primary vaccinations by the District Staff. 15. Among the primary vaccinations done in 1901-02 by the District Establishment 95.41 per cent. were successful, or almost the same as in the previous two years. Excepting Ráwalpindi the percentage of success in different districts varied between 93 and 99. In Ráwalpindi only 76.06 per cent. of the operations were successful. This low percentage was due to the use of glycerine lymph, which the Civil Surgeon states in his report was found generally a failure, and was therefore discontinued. Percentage of success among revaccinations. 16. The percentage among successful cases of revaccinations was 59.1 in 1901-02. This is slightly less than in the pre- vious two years. Persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population. 17. The rate of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population was 25.52 in 1901-02. It was 5.39 below the average rate of the previous five years. The deficiency was most marked in many of the plague infected districts. Thus in Umballa the proportion in 1901-02 was only 12 per 1,000 against the average rate of 32; in Hoshiárpur 21 against 45 ; in Ludhiána 16 against 28 ; in Feroze- pore 14 against 26, and in Gurdáspur 25 against 39. The districts with the highest rates of successful operations. 18. With the exception of Simla, in which, owing to the prevalence of small-pox, an unusually large number of revaccinations were done, the highest rates of persons successfully vac- cinated per 1,000 of population both in 1901-02 and in the preceding quinquennial period, were in the district of Kángra, viz., 61.24 and 60.7, respectively. And as the result of the exceptionally good work done in this district, it had the smallest death rate from small-pox. The average annual number of deaths from this disease registered in Kángra during the five years ending in 1900-01 was only 17, equal to a death rate of 0.02 per 1,000 against the average provincial rate of 0.61 for the same period. Appendix to Statement No. I. 19. The Special Staff. -The vaccinators of the Special Staff performed a total of 71,266 operations against 80,825 in 1900-01 and 89,242 in 1899-00. These figures show a steady decline in the work of the Special Staff during the last two years. The decrease in 1900-01 was attributed to the same causes which interfered with the work of the District Staff. The principal cause of the diminution in the number of
4 vaccinations in 1901-02, as stated by Captain Wilkinson in his report, was that &quot; a group of the vaccinators was employed during the last cold weather in the Simla district partly in accordance with the desire expressed by the Rájas of some of the Hill States, and partly on account of an epidemic of small-pox in sme of these States, where the vaccinators met with considerable opposition, and were not able to do much work.&quot; Primary vaccinations by the Special Staff. 20. The total number of primary vaccinations done by the Special Staff in 1901-02 was 55,557. This number is 11,867 less than in 1900-01, and 19,716 smaller as compared with the year 1899-00. Re-vaccinations by the Special Staff. 21. Under the head of re-vaccinations, however, the work of the Special Staff was more satisfactory than in the previous two years, the number in 1901-02 being 15,709 as com- pared with 13,401 in 1900-01 and 13,969 in 1899-00. Percentage of success in primary and secondary vaccinations by the Special Staff. 22. The percentage of success among primary vaccinations was 81.89 against 85.73 and 86.4 in the preceding two years. The amount of success under re-vaccinations was 51.5 per cent. as compared with 48.68 in 1900-01 and 62.38 in 1899-00. Appendix to Statement No. I. 23. The Cantonment Staff.5 Umballa, Simla, Kángra and Lahore, the Civil Surgeons found little or no time to inspect a sufficient number of cases. On the whole, the inspection work of the Department was satisfactory. Vaccination in Native States. 27. Complete returns for the triennial period have been received from the Native States of Patiála, Kapurthala, and Farídkot. In Patiála and Kapurthala there has been a considerable decrease in vaccinations during the last two years in consequence of the pre- valence of plague. Vaccination Act. 28. During the year 1901-02, there was no addition to the number of municipal towns that have adopted the Compulsory Vac- cination Act, It will be seen on reference to Appendix A to this report that in some of these towns, as for instance in Delhi, there was a large number of children remaining unvaccinated at the end of the year 1901-02. This shows that though these towns have adopted the provisions of the Act, they are not enforced as they should be, but these towns, as a whole, have a smaller proportion of children unvaccinated than those in which the Act is not in force. With reference to the remarks made in Government of India letter No. 1926, dated the 18th October 1901, and in Punjab Government letter No. 1343, dated the 11th November 1901, on the subject of improvement of vaccinations in towns, I have in my tours of inspection urged on Civil and Medical Officers and Municipal Committees the necessity of persuasion being brought to bear both in respect to the introduction of the Vaccination Act and the vaccination of children where the Act is not in force. Success of the vaseline vaccine paste and animal lymph. 29. An estimate of the amount of success attained by vaccination done with either vaseline vaccine paste or animal lymph can be made by taking the figures of the vaccination operations done in the Miánwáli District with both varieties. Of the 8,848 primary vaccinations performed by the District Staff with animal lymph, 8,747 or 99.7 per cent. were successful. Of the 7,131 primary operations performed mostly by the Special Staff with vaseline vaccine paste, 5,824 or 91.9 per cent. were successful, the reason for the vaseline vaccine being less successful than the fresh animal lymph is that the vaseline vaccine was used in the warmer months when the percentage of success is always less with all kinds of vaccine lymph. Another reason is that the vaccine used is prepared at the Animal Lymph Depôt without the direct supervision of a Deputy Sanitary Commissioner. Taking all this into consideration the percentage of success is very fairly good. Glycerine lymph. 30. The instructions of the Government of India for a trial on a large scale of glycerinated lymph could not be carried out for want of a whole time Deputy Sanitary Commissioner. The apparatus for the manufacture of glycerine lymph referred to in paragraph 13 of the notes on vaccination for 1900-01 was received from England in May 1901, but Captain Wilkinson had no time to spare from his plague work for the preparation of this lymph. His continued employ- ment on plague duty also prevented his carrying on the experi- ments with regard to the protection afforded by vaseline vaccine paste. These facts as well as the falling off in the work of the Special Staff all point to the absolute necessity for a Deputy Sanitary Commissioner who can devote the whole of his time to the duties of vaccination. Expensive apparatus has been obtained from England for the preparation of vaccine, but it must remain idle while there is no officer to use it. In my report for the year 1898-99 I pointed out the necessity for the careful preparation of vaccine in a Central Depôt for the whole province, this matter which is of the very greatest import- ance cannot be proceeded with until an officer is provided who can carry out the experiments ordered by the Government of India in their letter No. 63, dated 8th January 1900. As pointed out last year, I could not carry out these
6 experiments which were intended to prove the efficacy of vaseline vaccine introduced originally by me. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, C. J. BAMBER, LIEUT-COL., I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab.

I found 97.29 per cent. of primary and 52.59 per cent. of re-vaccinations successful, the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner found 90.63 and 25, the Civil Surgeons 98.43 and 75.29, the Divisional Inspectors 96.89 and 64.86, and the Native Supervisors 96.88 and 72.23. Vaccination in Native States. 17. The number of primary operations and re-vaccinations performed in the Native State of Patiala were 45,088 and 9,707, in Kapurthala 6,207 and 39, in Faridkot 4,289 and 1,632 and in Nábha 866 and 1. The percentages of success in primary and secondary cases were 98.63 and 43.96 in Patiála, 96.21 and 53.85 in Kapurthala, 97.58 and 89.58 in Farídkot and 88.68 and 100 in Nábha. Vaccination in towns. Appendix A, 18. The Vaccination Act was not extended to any new town during the year. On comparing the statistics of the large towns in which the Vaccination Act is in force, it appears that there was a greater proportion of infants remaining unvaccinated during the year in Delhi and Jullundur than in Lahore, Amritsar, Gujránwála, Ráwalpindi and Dera Gházi Khan. With regard to Delhi, the Civil Surgeon states that 1,030 notices were issued under the provisions of the Act, in 442 of these the children had left the city and in 588 they could not be found anywhere. The prevalence of plague in many of the towns has doubtless interfered with the work, but the principal causes of the slow progress of vaccination in towns are the apathy of the people and the want of interest on the part of members of Municipal Committees. Experiments on vaselina- ted and glycerinated pulp. 19. Captain Harvey, Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, carried out ex- periments on vaselinated and glycerinated vaccine pulp asked for by the Government of India. His report giving the results of his experiments, with my remarks, has been submitted to Government. As there is more to be done with regard to the bactereology of vaccine, I have asked him to carry out further investigations, especially as to the effect of chloroform and heat in purifying vaccine of extraneous germs. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, C. J. BAMBER, LT.-COL., I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab.
