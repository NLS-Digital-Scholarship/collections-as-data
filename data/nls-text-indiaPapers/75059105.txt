If a colony reacted, it was sub-cultured on agar. From agar, tubes of glucose agar and litmus milk were inoculated in the first place, and if no gas was produced in the former, and in the latter the production of alkali, after a preliminary acid formation, without clotting, occurred, then it was grown in, the various sugars. The indol reaction, and the effect of inoculation into the rabbit was also determined. The morphological characters of the bacillus, motility, etc., as well as its behaviour towards Gram's stain, were noted in each case. In this way it was possible to determine exactly the variety of dysentery bacillus under observation. Each case of dysentery was examined a number of times for the Bacillus dysenteri7 be observed, also, that the excretion of the bacilli in some cases is intermittent. The full details of the results of the examination of each case of bacillary dysentery are given in Table I, Appendix. The Widal reaction in bacillary dysentery was tested in a number of cases. It was not possible to separate an infection with B. dysenteri8 d'avoir cree cette fausse conception d'Amibe non pathogene.'
