I attended the Show and acted as a joint Secretary. During the Show I inspected the stallions noted in the margin and found them, with the exception of "Comet", in good condition.

I inspected the stallions noted in the margin and found them in excellent condition, with the exception of " Sepoy," who had been sick and was then in poor condition. I examined the horse and recommended him to be sent to the Veterinary School, Poona, for treatment; but he became worse and died on the 11th of November, vide Government Resolution No. 8373 in the Revenue Department, dated 8th December 1887. No mares were brought forward for branding. Cottonham ... T. B. E. Sepoy ... ... N. T. E. Lachin ... ... Arab. Harvester ... Do. 32. On my way back I visited Vánkáner and inspected the paddock and found many improvements had been made. New paddocks having been built and everything looked after by Mr. Laud in a most efficient manner. 33. From Vánkáner I went to Bhávnagar and inspected the paddock there. From Bhávnagar I returned to Bombay and remained there some days to inspect the Persian horse importations. Sátára District. Khandála, 24th November. Bhuinj, 25th November. 34. I commenced my tour in this district at Khandála on the 24th of November, where 16 mares were collected for my inspection. I branded 2 for horse and 11 for pony.

At Sátára I inspected 41 mares, branded 2 for horse and 29 for pony : the mares were small. Karád, 2nd December. 36.

Sind Province. Shikárpur, 5th to 13th January 1888. 46. I assisted at the Horse Show, which lasted from 5th to 12th January. During the Show I B 4026 Horse Stallions. Sobersides... T. B. E. Planet...

I took this opportu- nity of having all the stallions in the district, as per margin, brought in for my inspection. The horse stallions had not been sufficiently employed, therefore I ruturned two to Jacobabad where there is plenty of work for them. Madeji, 19th January. 47. I then went to Madeji in the same district where only 15 mares were collected though timely notice was given. I branded 1 for horse and 10 for donkey. Sukkur, 20th January. 48. At Sukkur I branded 10 mares for horse and 7 for donkey. Rohri, 21st January. 49. Here I branded 3 mares for horse and 8 for donkey. Radhan, 23rd January. 50. I proceeded here on the 22nd January. 155 mares were collected, out of which I branded 38 for horse and 77 for donkey, rejecting 40. The mares were a good lot and the owners of small mares were eager to accept the donkey brand. Lárkhána 24th January. 51. My next visit was to Lárkhána where 538 mares were collected, out of which 91 were branded for horse and 35 for donkey. Many more mares would have been branded for donkey, but it began to rain heavily and the owners would not remain. Jacobabad, 25th January to 2nd February. 52. Here 486 mares were inspected and I branded 171 for horse, 92 for pony, 23 for donkey, and rejected 200. I also inspect- ed the stable and stallions noted in the margin and found them in good health and condition, with the ex- ception of " Ramghat", " Ka- marputta", "Jack" and " Cu- pid ", who were suffering from Bursáti, and I recommended treatment, &c. This year there was a Horse Show and over 1,000 animals were enter- ed. Most of the exhibits were from the district proper and very few from the Shikárpur or Sibi districts. The Show was a great success both in number and quality, and I am of opinion that it was the best Show I have attended ; and from the interest the breeders take in horse-breeding it is likely to improve and become a good market for the purchase of remounts. Most of the prize-winners were the produce of Government stallions. Two prizes were given to the best remounts purchased by the Remount Committee. In the Remount classes there were 117 exhibits.

My next visit was to Mirpur in the Shikárpur District, where I branded 21 mares for horse, 5 for pony and 54 for donkey, rejecting 40. The mares were small and mostly suited for mule-breeding. Hyderabad, 15th to 17th February. 54. I arrived here on the 15th and assisted at the Horse Show. The Show was not a success ; but I think this was partially owing to untimely rain. There were about 200 exhibits. Many of the classes had no entries. The breeders here were not willing to accept the brand. Horse Stallions. Dwarka ... Arab. Eureka .. Do. Donkey Stallions. Pindi ...

7 Bhuj in Cutch, 20th to 25th February. 55. I arrived here on the 20th of February. The Horse Show was held here at Kharsara near Bhúj. I cannot compare this year's Show with the last, as I did not attend it: but there was a falling off in the number of exhibits from that of 1885-86. This can be accounted for by the fact that none were exhi- bited by the Darbár. Here I branded 20 mares for horse. I also inspected the stallions noted in the margin and found them in good health and condition, except " Torna ", who was too fat and was suffering from 8 Besides these, one Arab horse was presented to Government by Mr. Alfred Keyser, the then Collector of Kolába, for stud purposes (vide Government Resolution No. 3161 in the Revenue Department, dated 21st May 1887) and was sent to Ahmedabad for service. Decrease : Casualties. 61. The number of deaths among stallions was 5, as shown in Appendix I. The causes of deaths, &c, are shown in Appendix II. From fever one ; the stallion " Pickle " from laringitis ; " Sir Robert" from Kumri; "Sepoy " from the bursting of a blood vessel, and Bluelight from inflammation of bowels9 Provinces. 1878-79. 1879-80. 1880-81. 1881-82. 1882-83. 1883-84. 1884-85. 1885-86. 1886-87. 1887-88.

Horse-breeding continues developing in Deccan, Sind and Cutch, and it remains steady in Gujarát and Beluchistan. The stallions in Káthiáwár have done very little work and I would recommend that they be withdrawn from that province. The Native Chiefs are inclined to keep their own stallions and they should be encouraged in this. Strength of stallions. 68. The strength of stallions was 117, including Beluchistan, of which 110 were employed in the districts during the year. The remainder stood at the Depôt during the covering season for acclimatization. Future supply of stallions. 69. I expect to receive 2 thorough-bred English and 2 Norfolk Trotter stallions next trooping season from England, and, if necessary, I shall purchase a few more stallions locally. Cost of keep, &c 70. The total cost of feeding and attendants, including road expenses, construction of stallion stables and cost of stable gear, will be found in Appendix VI. 71. The general average per stallion during the last ten years has been as follows :10 besides this his transit charges from Poona to Umarkot were debited during 1887-88. Shikárpur. The reason for the excess in the expenditure is owing to the transit charges of four animals sent to Meerut from Shikárpur. Rs. 432-1-0 were spent under this head. If this be deducted the average will be about the same as reported last year. Jacobabad. The increase here is due to the addition of stal- lions, which is also accounted for as follows :11 Horse.

On the 31st March 1888 the total number of branded mares on the registers, as shown in Appendix X., was as follows :12 Cast mares sold to bonâ- fide breeders. 85. During the year under report three cast mares from British Artillery and Cavalry have been sold by public auction to bonâ fide breeders for horse-breeding. They are sold by the Military Department. The list of mares sold and prices realized will be found in Appendix XIII. The highest price was Rs. 76 and the lowest Rs. 6, and the average Rs. 29-10-8. Number of country-bred remounts purchased. 86. The number of remounts purchased, as shown in Appendix XIV, is given below :13 Increase during the year. 93. During the year under report the undermen- tioned donkey stallions were received :14 101. Appendix XXI. shows the several Horse Shows held in this Presidency and Beluchistan during the year 1887-88. I attended all these Horse Shows, with the exception of Ahmednagar and Sibi Horse Shows (For reasons see paragraphs 31 and 65 of this report). The cost of the Bhúj Horse Show was as usual defrayed by His Highness the Ráo of Cutch. This year Rs. 9,900 were contributed by Government towards these Shows. Of these Rs. 1,000 were paid by the Government of India towards the Sibi Horse Show. The number ex- hibited at these Shows was 4,352 against 3,263 last year. 102. Appendix XXII. is a general statement of expenditure incurred during the year under report. 103. The expenses incurred for the Superintendent and his office establish- ment are Rs. 9,862-11-0. This shows an increase of Rs. 1,306-15-10 over previous year. This is owing to my having drawn full staff pay throughout the year ; also to my visiting Sind. 104. The total Rs. 77,961-9-4 which shows a decrease of Rs. 5,112-8-4 from that of the last year and which is divided as follows :15 109.

Annual Administration Report of the Department of Horse-Breeding Operations for 1887-88. No. 7705. REVENUE DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 19th November 1888. Letter from the Superintendent of Horse-Breeding Operations, No. 793, dated 14th July 18882 very good reason to expect much improved results in the future. The early removal, as suggested, of the Government Stallions from Káthiáwár seems in the circumstances desirable, and should be carried out. A question has been separately raised and is now under consideration as regards the normal number of stallions required in this Presidency. 4. The only other point connected with horse-breeding which seems to call for notice is the extremely poor results as regards castration which con- tinue to be reported. The work of the salutris, the cost of whom in salaries and travelling allowances amounted to Rs. 1,525, appears to have consisted in the year under review of castrating 76 colts, or in other words each castration cost Government over twenty rupees. However desirable a general extension of gelding may be, such wasteful expenditure can no longer be permitted, and Mr. Grainger should be asked to report at once whether the salutris should not be forthwith discharged. It is assumed that the only work on which they are employed is that referred to above. 5. In mule-breeding which is almost confined to Sind some improvement is noticeable but the number of mules foaled in 1887-88 was small in proportion to the number of donkey stallions employed in the previous year. 819 mares were covered by donkey stallions in the year under review as compared with 616 in the previous year. The number of such stallions on the register was reduced from 32 to 23 during the year, a result chiefly of transfers to Bengal. 6. The expenditure incurred in the year under review, excluding payments from Local Fund and by the Government of India, amounted to Rs. 49,645-10-0 consisting ofDEPARTMENT OF HORSE-BREEDING OPERATIONS.

I inspected the stallions noted in the margin and found them in good condition, with the exception of " Nirghor ", who was lame from spavin, and I recom- mended him to be cast and sold. Sansár, 18th April 1888. 7. On my way to Indápur I halted here and branded 3 mares for pony. Indápur, 19th April 1888. 8. I was disappointed in finding a very small number of mares collected for my inspection, and only branded 4 for pony. The stallions " Kumayat" and " Siváji" were in good condition. 9. From 21st April to 1st May 1888 I was engaged in assisting in the examination of the students of the Bombay Veterinary College. Poona. 10. Thence I went to Poona and remained there till the 15th of May for office work, and then proceeded to Ahmednagar. Ahmednagar, 14th May 1888. 11. Here I branded 5 mares, and rejected 9. I also inspected the. marginally noted stallions and found them in good condition, with the exception of "Tomtit" and "Glen- dale " : the former was suffering from diseased hock and the latter from skin disease.

I arrived here on the 16th of May, and inspected 143 mares, out of which I branded 5 for horse and 135 for pony. The mares were a good lot. The Mámlatdár gave every assistance in collecting the mares. I inspected the Government stallion " Allan Bane ", and found him in excellent condition. The stable was not at all in good condition, and I solicited Government sanction for the erection of a new stable, which was accorded in Government Resolution No. 4154 in the Revenue Depart- ment, dated 25th June 1888.
4 Kopargaon, 18th May 1888. 13. On the 18th of May I arrived at Kopargaon, and branded 2 mares for horse and 38 for pony. The mares were a middling lot. The Arab stallion " Clipper " was in good condition. Yeola, 20th May 1888. 14. From Kopargaon I proceeded to Yeola in the Násik District, and branded 46 mares for pony and rejected 10. The stallion " Pilgrim" was in excellent condition, but reported to be very vicious. The stable was under construction. Málegaon, 22nd May 1888. 15. I arrived here on the 22nd May, branded 17 mares for pony, and rejected 27. The stallion " Cruiser " was standing in a chappar near the old fort, and the new stable was under construction. Nándgaon, 23rd May 1888. 16. From Málegaon I proceeded viâ Manmád to Nándgaon, where I brand- ed 35 mares for pony, and rejected 13. The stallion " Cyclone " was in good condition. The mares here are very small. Chálisgaon, 25th May 1888. 17. I visited Chálisgaon, in Khándesh, on the 25th May, and was much disappointed on seeing the poor number presented for my inspection. The stallion " Pinto" was in fair condition. Dhulia, 27th May 1888. 18. From Chálisgaon I marched to Dhulia, the chief town of the Khán- desh District. Here the Mámlatdár of the place brought 67 mares for my inspection, and I branded 47 for pony, and rejected 20. The stallion " Lieutenant" standing here was suffer- ing from liver disease, and his sheath was in a filthy state. I recommended treatment, &c. Násik, 2nd June 1888. 19. Here only 4 mares were brought forward, and as they were a poor lot I branded 1. I am afraid due notice of my com- ing there was not given to the breeders of the sur- rounding villages. The stallion " Multum " is considered to be vicious ; but I consider it due to insufficient exercise, and orders have been given that he should get more. 20. From Násik I returned to Poona, and remained there till the 27th of October. During this time I branded 19 mares for horse and 7 for pony. While here I was engaged in office work. I was on leave from 15th August to 20th September 1888. Punch, bad stock-getter. Siváji, do. Hyder, bad constitution. 21. On the 25th of September I assisted at the Horse Show in Poona. The Show was a success. I took this opportunity of having all the stallions in the district brought in for my inspection. The margin- ally noted stallions were found useless for stud pur- poses, for reasons given against each of them, and were recommended to be cast and sold. Deesa, 30th October 1888. 22. I started on my tour in Gujarát on the 27th of October, due notice of my coming having been given to the breeders by the Political Superintendent of Pálanpur. I reached Deesa on the 30th, inspected 18 mares, and branded 14 for pony, and rejected 4. The pony stallion " Majeeb " was in fair condition. Ahmedabad, 1st to 6th November 1888. 23. From Deesa I returned to Ahmedabad. Here I inspected the Government stallions noted in the margin, and found them in good condition, with the exception of the following three:5 Mehmdabad, 7thNovember 1888. Nadiád, 9th November 1883. 24. I next proceeded to Mehmadabad, where I inspected 17 mares, branded 1 for horse and 13 for pony. Thence I went to Nadiád, where I branded 6 mares for pony. A'nand, 11th November 1888. 25. At A'nand, 5 mares were branded for pony. Dákor, 13th November 1888. 26. At Dákor I inspected 7 mares and branded 5 for pony. Kaira, 15th November 1888. 27. Out of the 7 mares presented for my in- spection I branded 6 for pony. Wásad, 16th November 1888. 28. At Wásad 2 mares were collected for my inspection, and I rejected them, as they were in poor condition. 29. I visited all the places mentioned by the Collector of Kaira, but was disappointed in not getting sufficient number of mares for my inspection. Ahmednagar, 20th Novem- ber 1888. 30. I proceeded here on the 20th November and inspected the stallions at the Depôt. I found " Bahádur" suffering from disease of sheath and penis, and " Tomtit " from in- curable strained hock ; both were recommended to be cast and sold. The other stallions were in good condition. Alligaon,25th November1888. 31. I visited this place for the purpose of inspecting the old stables, with a view to placing two Government stallions there, so as to put them within easy reach of the mares of the surrounding villages. The stables are well suited. The chief Commissariat officer had agreed to provide the accommodation asked for,provided the arrange- ments as regards feed, &c., could be made by this Department. I then asked the Collector of Poona whether he would take the responsibility of the well-being of the stallions if placed at Alligaon and arrange for their keep, &c. In reply he stated that it was quite impossible for the Police to undertake the responsi- bility of looking after the stallions, for the chief constable of the táluka has his head-quarters at Ghodnadi, a distance of some 16 or 18 miles. I therefore gave up the idea of making it a stallion stand. Here I branded 4 mares for horse and 14 for pony. Sirúr, 29th November 1888. 32. I next went to Sirúr and branded 8 mares for pony. Most of the mares brought forward were in poor condition. 33. On my return to Poona on the 3rd of December I branded 3 mares for pony. Rájkot, 9th to 17th Decem- ber 1888. 34. I attended the Horse Show held here. The total number of horses exhibited was 355. Last year the number was 470. The falling off is possibly due to the scarcity of forage and to the absence of the Political Agent and Pránt officers. As regards numbers, the Show compared favourably with that held in 1885 and former years. The mares belonging to Girássiás and cultivators exhibited in brood mares' classes were a fair lot. I inspected the marginally noted stallions, and distributed them as follows :6 Government Resolution No. 6607, dated 30th October 1888. 36. It was decided to hold alternate Shows at Jacobabad and Shikárpur, and this was the first Show of the kind. The Show was a decided success as regards the number and qua- lity of the exhibits. About 37 remounts were pur- chased by Major Chalmers, the Punjáb Remount Agent, and the Officers Commanding the Cavalry Regiment at Jacobabad ; also 9 mules were purchased by Captain Picot, Assistant Commissary General. Thull, 14th January 1889. 37. On the recommendation of Mr. Giles I visited this place for the pur- pose of inspecting and branding mares ; 6 were brand- ed for horse and 18 for donkey, and 60 rejected. The mares were a poor lot, as will be seen from the number rejected. Radhan, 20th January 1889. 38. I arrived here on the 20th, but only 14 mares were brought forward ; and as they were a very poor lot, I only branded 1 for horse and 10 for donkey. Lárkhána, 22nd January 1889. 39. Here 500 mares were collected for my inspection, and I branded 34 for horse, rejecting the rest. Madeji, 24th January 1889. 40. I arrived at Madeji on the 24th January. Inspected 51 mares, branded 5 for horse, and rejected 46. The mares were a wretched lot. Shikárpur, 26th January 1888. 41. On the 26th January I proceeded to Shikárpur and inspect- ed the stallions noted in the margin, and found them in good condition; only 3 mares were branded for horse, rejecting 40. Trustee ... N. T.

My next visit was to Ghotki, where I brand- ed 3 mares for horse and 1 for donkey. Sibi, 9th to 16th February 1889. 45. I arrived here on the 9th and assisted at the Horse Show.

On my way to Bhúj, in Cutch, I visited Hyderabad and inspected the stallions, as per margin. They were in fair condition. The stal- lion " Paradox" was brought in for my inspection from Thar and Párkar, and I transferred him to Hyderabad. Bhúj in Cutch, 2nd to 7th March. 49. The day selected for the Horse Show was in conjunction with the marriage festivities of Prince Kaluba, the brother of His Highness the Ráo. Many exhibits were expected to come, but only 250 were classified. The Show was an improvement on that held last year. The exhibits in the Remount class were a very middling lot. There were some good youngsters, all the produce of Government sires " Despatch " and " Gáikwár ", both Norfolk Trotter stallions. I inspected the marginally noted stallions and found them in good condition, with the exception of " Torna ", who was suffering from chronic disease of the testicles. I recommended him to be castrated and sold as useless for stud purposes. Only 4 mares were branded for horse. Despatch ... N. T. E. Elzevier ... T. B. E. Torna ... Arab. Glencoe ... Do.

7 Bombay, 12th to 17th Feb- ruary 1889. 50. On my way to Ahmedabad I halted here, and inspected the stables for the purpose of selecting a horse for the Rájpipla State, but did not succeed in getting one. On the 11th of March I attended the meeting of the Veteri- nary College. Ahmedabad, 20th to 26th February 1889. 51. The Show here was held on the 20th February and following days. The number of exhibits this year showed an increase of 19 compared with those of last year, and it is satisfactory to note that most of the exhibitors were cultivators and bonâ-fide breeders. Many owners had parted with their stock, owing to the dearness of forage. There were 56 entries in the Remount class. Notification was given to the effect that officers of several cavalry regiments and police corps would attend the Show with a view to purchasing remounts; also the fact that Government was prepared to buy young stock over one year suitable for remounts. But it appears that dealers did not give any credit to this, having been disappointed in previous years. However, 14 remounts were procured for cavalry and police, and 3 yearlings were purchased by Captain Webb, the Remount Agent, and sent to Hapur. Hampton ... ... T. B. E. January ... ... Arab.

The conclusion that must be arrived at from a comprehensive examina- tion of horse-breeding operations in the Bombay Presidency during the past year is that the progress is satisfactory in Sind, but there is no marked progress either in Gujarát or the Deccan. The reasons for this latter are in many cases, however, of a temporary character; especially the scarcity of forage in many districts has been unfavourable in various ways. In bad years the owners of mares show a most disheartening amount of apathy, and they sadly neglect their stock, which falls off very much in condition. The young stock is stunted in growth and frequently dies, or else it is prematurely sold off for a mere song, so that the owner finds no profits in breeding, and does not care to trouble himself in future years. Fortunately many of these youngsters are bought up by enterprising " Daláls ", who take them to places where grazing is to be had. I have not yet succeeded in thoroughly establishing that point, or in ascertaining whether there are any particular places where the bought-up foals from the different districts are accumulated. I think it probable that these places vary according to the local rainfall, and have noted this matter for careful investi- gation during the coming year. 54. With regard to the mares. The low condition brought about by scarcity of food is an extremely serious matter; for it not only prevents many of them from coming into season, holding or carrying their foals to the proper time and developing them properly before birth, but also affects their fitness for breeding purposes in coming years. As every horseman knows, once an animal thoroughly gets below par, a considerable length of time, care and good feeding are essential to bring the animal into good condition again. But, unfortunately, these mares never get the requisite care, and seldom the good feeding necessary ; hence we cannot be surprised at many of them turning out barren. Expensive- ness of fodder in any district not only renders my tour more costly to Govern- ment, but also renders it less valuable in results, because at such times the owners of mares will not travel far from home, and if they do, their mares are found in such a wretched state that it would be injudicious to give the brand, or allow them to have the services of the stallions. These reasons will fully ex- plain why fewer mares have been branded in this than in some previous years. They will also fully explain why I was not so constantly on the move touring, as might appear advisable to any one not fully aware of the emergencies under which horse-breeding operations have to be carried on in some parts of the
8 Bombay Presidency. The Government grant in the past year for travelling ex- penses in the Department was almost finished. It seems to me that very few suitable mares remain unbranded in the districts, but in future years as the fillies out of the mares originally branded become old enough they will be brought forward for the brand. It is to be feared, from certain evidence which I have to hand, that the orders of Government on the subject of the purchase of branded mares as remounts by purchasing officers of cavalry regiments have not been fully attended to, and it would be interesting and instructive if Government would obtain through the proper channel a return of the number of country-bred mares and of mares carrying the Government brand (with the age of each at the time of purchase) now actually in the Bombay Cavalry re- giments ; and should the number of branded troopers prove to be numerous, a statement as to what precautions have been taken to ensure that all branded mares purchased as remounts have been found to be barren. Such a return would be specially valuable at the present time, as this Department has in hand, as part of its work for the coming year, the subject of revision of the register of branded mares, with a view to determination of how many of these which have received the brand at any time cannot now be considered as at all likely to contribute to the future horse wealth of the country. The coverings of mares would certainly have been much more numerous but for the extremely poor con- dition of the mares and for the unwillingness of the owners to bring them to the stand in such poor condition. 55. As regards the results of coverings, although they will undoubtedly admit of considerable improvement, it may be observed from the returns that the percentage in 1887-88 was higher in this Presidency than in Bengal or in the Punjáb. It is probable that the returns for the year under report will give a like result. 56. I have to remark that Bijápur and Dhárwár districts are somewhat backward in making full use of Government stallions. I am not yet prepared to explain the reason of this, but will make the matter a subject of investigation. 57. This year the Government stallions were withdrawn from Káthiáwár, which increases the stallion power available for other places. The measure was adopted after careful consideration, and for reasons which I need not enter into here. 58. Mule breeding is now practically confined to Sind, there only being 1 donkey stallion in the Presidency proper. It will be observed from the returns that several mules were purchased for Government purposes at Jacob- abad, and I look forward hopefully to the prospects of mule-breeding in Sind. 59. During the year, Horse Shows were held at Poona, Rájkot, Bhúj, Jacobabad and Sibi, and proved successful in the main and popular; a number of Shows were held in Native States; and as these have been contrasted with the Government Shows, rather to the detriment of the latter, I think it would be well that I visit some of them during 1889-90, so as to see whether the compa- risons are well founded. 60. Remounts.9 63. Castration is decreasing in frequency, probably because the classes for geldings have to an extent been done away with, and the money prizes for them withdrawn or reduced. The salutris find great difficulty in inducing owners of colts to have them operated on. 64. Finally, I must remark that throughout the Presidency the local officers have, in the majority of cases, carefully advanced horse-breeding interests. I may be permitted to specially draw the attention of Government to the valuable aid which I have received from Mr. Giles, the Deputy Commissioner of Jacobabad, Colonel Hogg, Commandant Poona Horse, and Mr. Adams, the District Superin- tendent of Police, Ahmedabad. STATISTICAL REPORT. Horse-breeding Operations. Stallions, number of. 65. At the commencement of the year under report the number and classes of horse stallions present are shown below :10 H. P. Total. Thorough-bred English ... ... ... ... 11 0=11 Half-bred English, Norfolk Trotters ... ... 12 0=12 Arabs ... ... ... ... ... 35 37=72 Pegu ... ... ... ... ... 0 1= 1 Total ... 58 3811 Thus there is a decrease of Rs. 18-8-11 in the general average as compared with the previous year. Only 3 donkey stallions were sent to Sind, and very few horses were transferred within the Presidency Proper : hence the decrease in the expenditure. I will have to make several changes in the stands during the current year. Accordingly the expenditures under this head will be considerably increased. Map of horse-breeding opera- tions. 76. The names of stallion stands in the districts are shown in the map (vide Appendix V) of horse and mule-breeding oper- ations. Horse stands are marked in red, and donkey stands in green. 77. The number, names of stallion stands, the number of branded mares in each district and the number of mares covered at each stand are given in Appendices VI and VII. Information as to where the horses and pony stallions are respectively stationed is given in Appendix VI. 78.

Annual Administration Report of the Department of Horse-Breeding Operations for 1888-89. No. 6640. REVENUE DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 6th September 1889. Letter from the Superintendent, Horse-Breeding Operations, No. 860, dated 8th July 18892 The question of the purchase of branded mares by officers commanding mounted corps is one which has already been dealt with by Government in Resolution No. 2513, dated the 28th March 1883. The Military Department should be asked to furnish a return shewing the number of country-bred mares and of mares carrying the Government brand (with the age of each at the time of pur- chase) now in the Bombay Cavalry Regiments. It is presumed that the reason why none of the young stock purchased by Captain Webb was sent to the newly-established depôt at Ahmednagar was that arrangements had not then been made for the reception of the selected animals. Bijápur. Násik. Dhánwár. Shirpur. Dahivadi. Chopda. Koregaon. Mirpur. 3. The number of stallions serving at the end of the year 1887-88 was 103, of whom 59 were horses and 44 ponies. During the year under review five horses were added to this number, three died from various causes, one was destroyed and eight were sold as having become unfit for stud purposes. The number on the register at the end of the year was 96 and Mr. Grainger remarks that there will be no need for the present to make any addition to it. With reference to this Mr. Grainger's attention should be drawn to Government Resolution No. 8318, dated the 13th December 1888, by which the number of horse and pony stallions required for the Presidency was fixed at 95. It is satis- factory to notice that 62 of the 96 stallions now standing are classed as "very good." In accordance with the instructions given in paragraph 2 of the review of last year's report Mr. Grainger has submitted a statement showing the distribution of the horse and pony stallions throughout the Pre- sidency. From this it appears that the services of the stallions at many places, notably those given in the margin, were not availed of to anything like the full extent desirable. In view of the very small number of mares covered by each stallion at Dhárwár it seems open to question whether some of those stand- ing there might not be transferred to other places where their services would be more frequently availed of. Mr. Grainger should favour Government with his opinion on this point. 4. The total number of mares covered during the year was 3,282 as against 3,578 in 1887-88, the decrease being partly due to a reduction in the number of stallions. The average number covered per stallion was 35.53 as compared with 35.10 in the previous year. The services of the stallions were therefore more frequently availed of in the year under review than in 1887-88. Mr. Grainger has not however explained why the stallions at the places mentioned in the last paragraph did not cover a proper complement of mares. In future an explanation should be given in every case when the number is below what Mr. Grainger considers satisfactory. The results of the coverings of mares in 1887-88 were ascertained in 2,762 cases and the percentage of foals to mares covered was 37.32 as against 37.42 in the previous year. His Excellency in Council regrets to notice that these figures still continue to remain unsatisfactory. 5. As regards castration the Governor in Council is glad to observe that some improvement is noticeable. The number of salutris has been reduced from 4 to 3, but notwithstanding this 98 colts were castrated during the year under review as against 76 in 1887-88. The increase was most marked in Poona, Ahmednagar and Ahmedabad. The cost of these operations to Govern- ment amounted to Rs. 1,494-4-0 as against Rs. 1,525 in 1887-88. The number of country-bred horses purchased during 1888-89 for use in this Presidency as remounts was 390, the majority being for the Bombay Native Cavalry. Some were also bought for other Presidencies. 6. There is nothing that calls for remark as regards the donkey-stallions. The number now standing is 23, being two less than the number which Govern- ment have fixed as required for the Presidency. With the exception of one which is at Sirur all of them are stationed in Sind. The general results of their coverings during the year under review can hardly be regarded as adequate,
3 seeing that although they covered 890 mares as against 819 in 1887-88 the increase in the number of foals produced was only 27 and apparently only about one in every nine mares covered produced a foal.

Yeola, 11th April 1889. 3. From Ráhuri I went to Yeola in the Násik District. Here I branded 10 mares for pony and rejected 15. Many of the mares were in poor condition. 4. I inspected the stallion "Pilgrim" and found him vicious and dangerous to the mares and syce and therefore recommended him to be castrated and sold on recovery. The new stable was nearly completed. Málegaon, 13th April 1889. 5. I visited Málegaon on the 13th April 1889 and branded 8 mares for pony and rejected 6. The mares were a poor lot. I found the stallion "Cruiser" in good condition. He was removed to the new stable near the old fort. Náudgaon, 15th April 1889. 6. At Nándgaon 50 mares were collected for my inspection and I branded 1 mare for horse and 8 for pony, rejecting 41. Most of the mares were in poor condition. The stallion "Cyclone" was in excellent condition. Chálisgaon, 16th April 1889. 7. Here I branded 2 mares for horse and 13 for pony.

The stallion "Lieutenant" was suffering from disease of sheath and cord and I recommended treatment, &c., but he became worse and it was then ascertained that the disease was incurable and I therefore recommended him to be cast and sold. Násik, 20th April 1889. 9. I proceeded here on the 20th April. Only 5 mares were collected for my inspection, although timely notice of my coming was given to the Mámlatdár of the táluka. I was disappointed on seeing the poor number presented. I only branded 3 mares for pony. The stallion "Multum'' was in good condition. Igatpuri, 22nd April 1889. 10. I next went to Jgatpuri where I branded 10 mares for pony and rejected 8. Bombay, 24th April to 5th May 1889. 11.

I visited Indápur on the 30th May for the purpose of inspecting and branding mares, but very few were sent though timely notice had been given. I inspected 15 mares, and branded 3 for horse and 9 for pony. Kumayat ... ... Arab. Ormonde ... ... Do. Teelwell... ... N. T. E. 19. I inspected the mar- ginally noted stallions and found them in excellent condition, 20. "Teelwell" was reported a slow coverer and was therefore transferred to Ahmednagar; there also he could not be induced to cover a mare and was subsequently sent to Babugarh. Poona. 21. From Indápur I returned to Poona and remained there till the 1st July and then proceeded to Bombay to attend the meeting of the Board of Managers of the Veterinary College and returned to Poona on the 4th and remained there till the 11th. On the 12th I proceeded to Ahmednagar for the purpose of inspecting depôt stal- lions and found "Wisechild" and "Adonis" suffering from sores and "Glendale" was suffering from skin disease and I recommended treatment, &c. The other stallions were in good condition. I returned to Poona on the 18th and remained there till 28th for office work and then proceeded to Bársi in the Sholápur District. Bársi, 28th August 1889. 22. Here I branded 29 mares for pony and re- jected 15. The mares were small and only suited for pony-breeding. Shetphul, 30th August 1889. 23. I marched here on the 30th and inspected 81 mares; branded 1 for horse and 40 for pony and rejected 40. This place is on the way to Pandharpur and I recommended that a stallion be placed here if stabling and the necessary supervision could be given. Pandharpur, 31st August 1889. 24. Here the Mámlatdár of the place had col- lected 75 mares for my inspection and I branded 9 for horse and 36 for pony. Sángola, 2nd September 1889. 25. Out of 145 mares collected for my inspec- tion, I branded 16 mares for horse and 90 for pony rejecting 39. 26. The stallion "Phantom" was suffering from chronic disease of sheath and debility and was ordered to be sent to Veterinary School, Poona, for treat- ment. It was afterwards found that the disease was incurable, so he was cas- trated and sold by order of Government.
5 27. Thence I returned to Poona and remained there till the 10th of Sep- tember for office work. On the 11th I proceeded to Ahmednagar to see Colonel Deane, Director of Army Remount Department, and to confer with him on the arrangement regarding the establishment of Rearing Depôt6 43. On ray way from Hyderabad to Málegaon I inspected the Nizám's paddock, stallions and young stock at Sangar-Hati, and I recommended Mr. Ali Abdula to cast some stallions suffering from hereditary unsoundness. The grasses here are excellent for young stock. The farm and the grazing is very good. 44. The Rájkot Horse Show was held from 9th to 14th of December 1889, but I was unable to attend this as I had to go to Málegaon7 Sukkur, 18th to 24th Janu- ary 1890. 52. I next went to Sukkur and remained there for office work. Rádhan,25th January 1890. 53.Here I branded 7 mares for horse. The stallions of the Hyderabad District were brought here for my inspection and I found them in good condition. Mirpur, 28th to 31st Janu- ary 1890. 54.Out of 55 mares presented for my inspection I branded 5 for horse and 25 for donkey. Lárkhána, 15th February 1890. 55.I proceeded here on the 15th and branded 25 mares for horse and 16 for donkey, rejecting 149. The mares were a poor lot as will be seen from the number rejected. Rádhan, 16th February. 76.I again visited this place in order to give the breeders a second chance, and branded 5 mares for horse and 14 for donkey, rejecting 60. Jacobabad, 17th February. 57.Here 542 mares were collected for my inspection, and I branded 27 for horse and 24 for donkey and rejected 491. The stable management was excellent. Thul,18th February. 58.My next visit was to Thul, where I branded 19 mares for horse, 10 for pony and 48 for donkey. Sibi, 24th to 27th February. 59. The Sibi Horse-Show was held on the 24th February and following days. I note that 97 remounts and young stock were purchased by Major Chalmers, besides those bought for local cavalry; this proves the value of Beluchistan as a field for remount operations. I also note the need for competent sálutris, and hope to make arrangements to meet it. Songster ... T. B. E. Duncan ... Do. Sir Francis ... Do. Sir James ... N. T. E. Brunno ... Do. Midnight ... Do.

I transferred the following stallions to Ahmedabad, as they were more than five years in this district:8 67.I should have liked to attend the Bombay Show, where I understand some of the young stock and many of the brood-mares and stallions of the Darbárs were exhibited, and an opportunity afforded of contrasting stock from several distinct portions of Western India. I note that a brood-mare from the Poona District took first prize and so also did her foal. 68.I inspected 135 mares and branded 18 for horse, 67 for pony and rejected 50. The mares were a good lot.

Deesa, 29th March 1890. 70.Here I inspected the Government stallions "Majeeb" and "Cottonham" and found them in excellent condition. I found "Majeeb's" services were fully utilized, but "Cotton- ham" got a small number of mares to cover, being considered too big. I trans- ferred him to Ahmedabad and sent "Lord Napier" in his place. General Remarks. 71.This year as last it is evident that Gujarát and the Deccan have not made satisfactory progress in horse-breeding operations. Scarcity of forage has continued, and so long as this is the case results will be indifferent. It is a matter which doubtless is receiving adequate attention from the Agricultural Department, but it is much to be hoped that in the coming year the rainfall will be such as to secure the stock of all kinds in abundance, or at any rate a sufficient supply of good natural fodder. 72.I have tried by personal enquiry to ascertain what special grazing grounds are resorted to by daláls in bad seasons, for the purpose of feeding young horse stock purchased by them. I find however that there is a consider- able amount of secrecy in connection with this matter, so have set the Inspec- tors of this Department to work to collect information on the subject indirectly. Should they collect material worth report I will specially inform Government in the matter for the information and guidance of the Remount Department. In Ahmednagar and Poona Districts the best places for grazing are as given by the Inspectors:9 officials, especially by the Central and Southern Divisions of the Presidency, for pony sires. It was shown that it was necessary to resort to special measures with a view to restoring the number and quality of pony stock, which had experi- enced exhausting drains through supplies of baggage ponies for active service. Government passed a special grant of Rs. 12,000 for the purchase of pony stallions. The Horse-breeding Department posted the stallions, branded a sufficiency of mares and inspected the districts. Thus all measures necessary to support these districts in their efforts to restore the breed of ponies were taken, and it is unfortunate that as yet the owners of mares have not shown themselves willing to take advantage of the facilities for breeding thrown in their way. 75.At Bijápur it seems the galloway "Motiram" was considered too large, so I have now replaced him by a 13-2 pony. With regard to Sholápur and Sátára, the number of stallions for the present has been reduced; but if in future the number of coverings indicate a larger demand it can be at once met, as suitable stallions are easily procurable. The district officials of Government are, I believe, fully impressed with the importance in every way of promoting the work of the Department, and I trust that their effort will prove successful in obtaining marked results when the present bad times cease. 76.It is interesting that under the influence of the Collector of Kaira a collection of pony mares was made in connection with the Nadiád Agricultural Show held in February last. A fair number of animals were brought together, and the exhibits were reported as satisfactory evidence of the work done in this district. I was not myself able to attend this Show, but I hope to be able to do so at the next exhibition if it is decided to again collect horse stock there. 77.A considerable reduction has been made in the register of branded mares by striking out those that have become useless or have been lost sight of or have died, and those that have been branded in Káthiáwár, from which place all Government stallions have been withdrawn; also those mares branded for donkey stallions in Cutch, Poona and Ahmednagar Districts, since the Government brand is no longer required for the donkey stallions. Retention of mares unnecessarily on the list is a mistake, as it is a sort of trap into which the critics of the department, who judge purely from the statistics, are spe- cially apt to be caught. It seems unnecessary to lower the percentage of produce and remounts purchased in proportion to the number of coverings and mares branded. 78.In the current year the Remount Department has started its rearing dep6t at Ahmednagar. Hitherto my work in connection with this department has been in purchasing young stock, a considerable number of which have gone to Karnaul and the remainder sent to Ahmednagar, where if well fed and brought up on the liberty system they ought to develop into animals valuable for Government. 79.A considerable part of my tour was occupied in the expedition to Málegaon Fair, for the purchase of remounts10 80.I have received a request to purchase remounts for the remount nur- sery in the coming year in Káthiáwár. But it seems to me that if I am to make a tour for the collection of young stock throughout Káthiáwár, I shall have very little time left for the performance of my special duties as Superintendent of Horse-breeding Operations. I have therefore to suggest that it would be as well if a Remount officer did the tour through Káthiáwár, and if he felt the need for my professional services, collected his young stock at such accessible place such as Porbandar or Bhávnagar, which I could attend at a special time in the course of annual tour. 81.In Sind remount work was done at the Fairs by Major Chalmers who availed himself fully of my professional services. In order that the work of the two departments may be done effectually at these Shows, it is necessary that an officer from each department should attend. This is the more necessary because the Superintendent of Horse-breeding Operations is from the very nature of the post obliged to obtain for the breeders the highest possible price, whereas a Remount officer should spend no more Government money than is absolutely necessary for remounts. It is therefore rather difficult to satisfactorily con- tinue the two duties. Certainly the Remount Department and Transport Depart- ment should always be represented at the shows and fairs of the country, as herein lies one of the secrets of obtaining country-bred stock for military pur- poses. The number of young stock purchased in Sind was considerable. The number of mares brought forward for the brand was considerable and conse- quently there were many rejections. Civil officers in Sind, especially Colonel Mayhew, Mr. Giles, Colonel Trevor, Mr. Steele, Mr. Mules, &c., &c, deserve notice here as valuable to the department, and altogether the prospects of horse- breeding operations are excellent. 82.I have not yet succeeded in attending the Chinchli Show, as it is held when I am on tour in Sind. Castration. 83. The number of castrations is quite insufficient; on carefully consider- ing this matter I have concluded that a change of system is necessary, and I hope to introduce gradually in the coming years a system of employment by the department of such Gra- duates of the Bombay Veterinary College as are posted in the districts on the system to be adjusted on each case in consultation with the District Local Boards. STATISTICAL REPORT. Stallions: Number of. 84. The opening balance of the number and classes of horse stallions was as follows:11 Sales, &c. 88. In all seven stallions were cast and sold as useless for stud purposes. The detailed particulars regarding these will be found in Appendix II. Three were sold for impotence. One was found to be vicious and dangerous to the syce and mares and therefore was cast and sold. The remaining three were suffering from incurable disease and were sold in consequence. Number of stallions present. 89. The number of stallions present on the 31st March 1890 is as follows:12 Cost of keep, &c., &c. 98. Appendix IV gives the total cost per annum of feeding, &c., of stallions. The general average per stallion during the last twelve years has been as follows:13 103. On the 31st March 1890 the number of branded mares remaining on the registers is shown in Appendix X as noted below:14 112. Many remounts were purchased at Shikárpur and Sibi Horse Shows, also at Jacobabad. Major Chalmers purchased in Sind 106 for Bengal Cavalry, 114 for Army Remount Department: but they are not included in this, as they were sent to other Presidencies. However there is an increase of 32 in the number purchased this year if compared with the figures of the last year. Castration of colts. 113. The number of colts castrated during 1889-90 by Government sálutris will be found in detail in Appendix XIV. The number operated on during the last nine years is given below:15 Demand for donkey stal- lions. 121. The demand for the services of donkey stallions continues. Mule- breeding is now confined to Sind. Since the close of the year under report I have transferred the one donkey stallion serving at Sirur in the Poona District to Jacobabad. It is hoped that in course of time about 20 donkey stallions will be required for Shikárpur alone. I expect to receive seven donkey stal- lions next trooping season. Several good mules were purchased here for Trans- port and I have no doubt but in a few years there will be a large market for mules in Sind. Cost of keep, &c., of donkey stallions. 122. The cost of feed, keep, attendants, &c., &c., of donkey stallions is given in Appendix XVII. The general average of the past seven years has been noted below:16 128. The number exhibited at these Shows was 3,017 against 3,624 last year, showing a decrease of 607, the reasons for which are given in my remarks on these Horse Shows. Cost of the Department during 1889-90. 129. The total expenditure incurred during the year 1889-90 is shown in Appendix XX. 130. The expenses incurred for the Superintendent and his office estab- lishment are Rs. 9,545-1-1 against Rs. 9,434-15-1, showing a difference of Rs. 110-2-0. The increase is attributed to the extensive travelling of the Superintendent during the year under report. 131. The total cost amounts to Rs. 65,606-9-4, showing a decrease of Rs. 2,283-6-5 over last year's expenditure. During the year no stallions were purchased and the Government contribution towards the Horse Shows was considerably reduced. 132. The expenses have as usual been divided into two sub-heads as follows:[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]

Annual Administration Report of the Department of Horse-Breeding Operations for 1889-90. No. 7961. REVENUE DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 8th November 1890. Letter from the Superintendent of Horse-Breeding Operations, No. 860, dated 5th July 18902 factory. The number of the former class of mares branded in Gujarát and the Deccan is particularly small, and it is explained that this result is due to a succession of indifferent seasons and consequent scarcity of fodder, Bijápur. Dhárwár. Dhulia. Shirpur. Chopda. Mirpur. Lárkhána. Beluchistán... Zál. Duki. Khakan. 4.Of the aggregate total number (103) of horse stallions on the register 93 were more or less actively employed during the year, the rest being either stationed at the depôt for acclimatization or temporarily unfit for service. The average number employed at stud work during the year is stated to have been 85.66 as compared with 92.35 during 1888-89. The number (3,113) of branded mares covered by the stallions during the year under review was less by 169 than the number (3,282) covered in 1888-89. The decrease is accounted for by the reduction in the number of stallions and the rejection of many of the mares brought to the stands to be covered owing to their poor condition. The average number of mares covered by horse and pony sires is stated to have been 36.34 in 1889-90 as compared with 35.55 in 1888-89. It is noticed that the average was parti- cularly and unsatisfactorily low at the stations noted on the margin. Mr. Grainger should have furnished an explanation in each of these cases as directed in paragraph 4 of Government Resolution No. 6640, dated 6th Sep- tember 1889. 5.The produce foaled in the year under review as the result of the coverings of 1888-89 is given as 419 colts and 350 fillies or a total of 769. The proportion which this figure bears to the number of mares covered in 1888-89 is 33.61 per cent, as compared with 37.32, the percentage returned in 1888-89. This falling-off is reported to be due to the weak state of a large number of the covered mares and their consequent incapacity to hold. The average number of produce foaled during 1889-90 per stallion employed at stud work in 1888-89 amounts to 11.83. 6.The number of remounts purchased for the Army and the Police during the year was 423, of which 104 were the produce of Government stallions. Of the remounts bought 28 were purchased for the Ahmednagar remount rearing depôt by Mr. Grainger who was directed to visit the Horse-show held at Málegaon in the Hyderabad State for this purpose. The Superintendent has also been requested to make similar purchases during the current year in Káthiáwár, but he points out now that compliance with this order will interfere with the performance of the ordinary duties of his appointment, as Káthiáwár is no longer included within the sphere of his operations, and suggests that the work should be entrusted to a Remount officer specially appointed for the purpose. Mr. Grainger should be requested to furnish Government with a copy of the instructions received by him directing him to proceed to Káthiáwár to purchase remounts, in order that if necessary the attention of the Government of India from whom presumably the instructions were received may be invited to the suggestion made by Mr. Grainger with a view to such orders being passed as may be deemed proper. The opinion of the Military Department should be requested on the suggestion made in paragraph 81 of the report regarding the advisability of deputing officers of the Remount and Transport Departments to attend Horse-shows for the purchase of young stock. 7.The number (72) of colts castrated during the year was less by 26 than the number (98) operated on in 1888-89 and by 16 than the average of the three preceding years. On the other hand, there was an increase in the expenditure on account of the castrators' establishment which rose from Rs. 1,494-4-0 in 1888-89 to Rs. 1,530-10-0 in 1889-90. It appears from paragraph 83 of the report that the present system has not proved successful and that Mr. Grainger hopes to secure more satisfactory results when the new Civil Veterinary Department is organized and Veterinary graduates are employed to perform the duty.
3 8.Of the 25 donkey stallions on the roll on 1st April 1889 two were des- troyed, leaving 23, of which one was stationed in the Deccan and 22 in Sind and Cutch. To this number must be added one in Beluchistán, thus making a total of 24 in charge of the Superintendent of Horse-Breeding Operations during the year under review. Of the donkey stallions 13 are classed as very good, 8 as good and 3 as fair. Since the close of the year the only donkey stallion serving in the Presidency proper has been transferred to Sind to which Province mule- breeding is now entirely confined. The demand for good mules is steadily rising in Sind and the Superintendent expects to receive from Europe 7 more donkey stallions during the current trooping season. 9.The total number of mares covered by the donkey stallions in 1889-90 was 821 as compared with 890 in 1888, thus showing a decrease of 69, which is explained to be due to the reduction in the number of stallions and the in- ability of 4 of the stallions to cover owing to sickness or other causes. The average number of donkey stallions employed was 20.20 and the average number of mares covered by each stallion was 40.64 in the year under review. 10.The produce of Government donkey stallions foaled in the year under review is shown as 40 colt and 33 filly mules as compared with 62 and 41 re- spectively in the previous year. The proportion of produce foaled during 1889-90 to the number of mares covered in 1888-89 is given as 18.38 per cent., which is much lower than the percentage (27.24) returned for 1888-89. 11.Horse-shows were held during the year at Poona, Ahmedabad, Rájkot, Shikárpur and Sibi. The reports on all the shows held within the Presidency have been reviewed separately by Government. The total expenditure on these shows amounted to Rs. 20,520-1-3, of which Rs. 6,600 were contributed from Provincial Revenues, Rs. 1,000 by the Government of India, and the rest from Local Funds and other sources. 12.The total expenditure of the year under review amounted to Rs. 65,606-9-4 or Rs. 2,283-6-5 less than that (Rs. 67,889-15-9) of the previous year. It is stated that out of the total expenditure Rs. 17,443-0-3 were met from Local Funds, Rs. 5,949-0-11 were paid by the Government of India on account of the expenses incurred in Beluchistán, while the remainder (Rs. 42,214-8-2) is chargeable to Provincial Revenues. The latter amount, however, includes Rs. 1,000 on account of the contribution of the Government of India to the Sibi Horse-show and should therefore be reduced by that sum. The actual expen- diture from Provincial Revenues thus amounts to Rs. 41,214-8-2 against Rs. 45,795-11-11 in 1888-89. 13.The total cost on account of supervision amounted to Rs. 13,613-8-7. Under the head "keep of stallions" the expenditure was Rs. 44,393-0-9, or, excluding Beluchistán, Rs. 38,443-15-10. The average cost of maintenance per horse stallion was Rs. 363, being higher than the cost incurred (Rs. 344) in 1888-89 and the average (Rs. 340) of the three preceding years taken together. The Superintendent of Horse-Breeding Operations attributes this increase to the "increased prices of gram and fodder during the year." Excluding Beluchistán, the average was highest in Sind and Cutch (Rs. 398) and lowest in Gujarát (Rs. 286). The average cost of maintenance of each donkey stallion amounted to Rs. 270 as compared with Rs. 260 in the previous year. There was thus an increase in cost during the year under review and not "a satisfactory decrease" as erroneously assumed by the Superintendent in paragraph 123 of his report. 14.In their review of the Administration Reports of the Horse-Breeding Department in the Bengal and Bombay Presidencies for the year 1888-89 the Government of India have remarked on the meagre results achieved in this Presidency in comparison with the expenditure incurred, and the Superintendent of Horse-Breeding Operations has been requested to furnish an explanation of the circumstances as to which the Government of India have found reason to
4 complain. The present report is equally unsatisfactory, and His Excellency the Governor in Council trusts that the District officers and the Superintendent will co-operate to extend the popularity and usefulness of the Department and thus bring about better results.

DEPARTMENT OF HORSE-BREEDING OPERATIONS. ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1890-91.
Annual Administration Report for the year 1890-91. No. 992 OF 1891. FROM J. K. GRAINGER, ESQUIRE, Superintendent, Horse-breeding Operations; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, REVENUE DEPARTMENT, Bombay. Office of the Superintendent, Department of Horse-breeding Operations, Bombay Presidency, Ahmednagar, dated 31st July 1891. SIR, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council, the Annual Administration Report of the Department of Horse-breeding Operations in the Bombay Presidency and Beluchistán for the official year 1890-91. I beg to state that the delay in submitting this is owing to several of the reports from the District officers being sent in late. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, J. K. GRAINGER, Superintendent, Horse-Breeding Operations, Bombay Presidency.
GOVERNMENT OF BOMBAY. DEPARTMENT OF HORSE-BREEDING OPERATIONS. ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1890-91. My tours in the Horse-Breeding Districts. 1.At the close of the last year I was at Deesa, thence I returned to my Head-quarters at Ahmednagar and remained there till the 20th of April 1890. I then went to Bombay for the purpose of assisting in the examination of the students of the Veterinary College. The examination lasted till the 1st of May, and after making a couple of days' halt at Poona, I returned to Ahmednagar. 2.Owing to a case of glanders in the Remount Rearing Depôt here and there being no other Veterinary Surgeon, I was obliged to remain the whole of May at Ahmednagar. 1st June to 15th July 1890. 3. From 1st June to 15th July I remained at Ahmednagar to do my office work. During this time I branded 17 mares for horse and 31 for pony. 4. From 14th of July to 15th of September I went on two months' privilege leave (vide Government Resolution No. 4688 in the Revenue Depart- ment, dated 5th July 1890) and Captain Williamson, the officer in charge of Remount Rearing Depôt, Ahmednagar, acted for me. Poona, 29th September to 7th October 1890. 5. On my return from leave I remained at Ahmednagar till 28th of September and then pro- ceeded to Poona to attend the Horse Show. 6.In point of number the show was the largest ever held in Poona. The quality of the exhibits in some classes was good, and in others the prizes were withheld owing to the incompetency of the exhibits. 7.During the show I branded 10 mares for horse, 8 for pony and rejected 15.

The marginally noted stallions were brought in for my inspection and I found them in good con- dition with the exception of "Kumayat," who had de- veloped ringbone. He was recommended to be castrat- ed and sold on recovery (vide Government Reso- lution No. 7688 in the Revenue Department, dated 29th October 1890). Koregaon, 8th October 1890. 9. My next journey was to Koregaon in the Sátára District where 95 mares were collected for my inspection. I branded 2 mares for horse and 6 for pony. Most of the mares were a wretched lot in poor condition. Karád, 29th October 1890. 10. At Karád on the 9th, 325 mares were collected, out of which I branded 1 for horse, 54 for pony and rejected the rest. I think all the mares in the táluka were collected. Here I inspected the Government stallion "Kingcraft" and found him in good health. Athni, 11th October 1890. 11. I then went to Athni in the Belgaum District where I branded 35 mares for pony and rejected 118. This was the first time the brand was introduced in this district. I
4 found the breeders willingly accepting the brand. The pony stallion "Rizak" was in good condition. Belgaum, 13th and 14th October 1890. 12. I remained at Belgaum on the 13th and 14th of October for the purpose of inspecting and branding mares, but I was disappointed, though timely intimation was given to the Collector of the District, and the Mámlatdar of Belgaum Táluka. Three mares from the city were sent to me, but they were a poor lot. Dhárwár, 15th October 1890. 13. I next went to Dhárwár and branded 23 mares for pony and rejected 112. Many of the rejected ones were small and in poor condition. 14. The pony stallion "February" and the Pegu pony "Diamond" were in good condition. The Arab pony "Moochel" was suffering from partial paralysis of the hind extremities and I recommended him to be cast and sold (vide Government Memorandum in the Revenue Department, No. 7689, dated 29th October 1890). Hubli, 16th October 1890. 15. Here I came on the 16th of October and inspected 70 mares and branded 5 for pony. The rejected were a wretched lot. Gadag, 17th October 1890. 16. I branded 10 mares for pony and rejected 52. I also inspected the pony stallion "Tippoo" and found him in good condition. 17. In accordance with the orders contained in Government Resolution in the Revenue Department, No. 6963, dated 2nd October last, the number of stallions was reduced to two. One was cast and sold and the other has been transferred to Pandharpur in the Sholápur District. Bijápur, 19th October 1890. 18, At Bijápur 39 mares were collected for my inspection and I branded 5 for horse, 14 for pony and rejected the rest. I inspected the Arab pony "March" and found him in excellent condition. Sholápur, 20th October 1890. 19. I next proceeded to Sholápur where 75 mares were collected for my inspection and I branded 1 for horse and 26 for pony. Bársi Road, 21st October 1890. 20. After giving due notice of my expected visit to this place to the Col- lector of Sholápur and the Mámlatdár of Mádha, I visited the place on the appointed date. I saw the Chief Constable of the táluka, when I asked him about mares. He showed me about 5. These were misshapen and unsound, so I had to reject them. Shetfal, 22nd October 1890. 21. From here I marched to Shetfal in the same táluka where the above- mentioned Chief Constable had collected 15 mares for my inspection, and I branded 10 for pony. I told him that about 50 to 60 mares were collected at this place when I visited it last time, and asked why such a small number was collected now. He replied it was owing to the Dasra holiday (on the 23rd there was Dasara holiday). I told him that I would visit the place on my way back from Pandharpur on the 27th and to try and collect mares for my inspection, but none were forthcoming. Pandharpur, 24th October 1890. 22. Here 150 mares were collected for my inspection and I branded 10 for horse and 34 for pony. The Mémlatdár appeared to me to be energetic, and there being a sufficient number of branded mares, I transferred one pony stallion from Dhárwár to this place. Sángola, 26th October 1890. 23. From Pandharpur I marched to Sángola where I branded 7 mares for horse and 23 for pony. 24. I inspected the stallion "Mootrib" stationed here and found him in good condition. The Mámlatdar of this place rendered me good assistance.
5 Shetfal, 27th October 1890. 25. On my way back to Bársi Road I again made a halt at this place as stated in paragraph 21 of this report. This time I branded 2 mares for horse and 8 for pony. Ahmednagar, 31 st October to 4th November 1890. 26. I came here for the purpose of attending the Ahmednagar Horse Show, which was to be held on the 3rd, 4th and 5th of November, but on arrival I found no signs of Horse Show and therefore I fixed the dates of my tour in Gujarát. 27. On the 14th of November the Honorary Secretary of the Ahmednagar Horse Show informed me that the show was to be held on the 30th, 31st of December 1890 and 1st January 1891. 28. I was not informed of the change of the dates, nor was I consulted as to whether the dates would suit me as is required to be done in accordance with the orders contained in the Government Resolution in the Revenue Department, No. 7298, dated 14th October 1886. The prospectus was already published and it was too late for me to suggest any other date. 29. Had not the date of the Jacobabad Horse Show been changed from 5th to 12th January, I should have been unable to attend this show. 30. I hope Government will be pleased to renew the orders contained in the abovementioned Government Resolution and draw the attention of the district officers to them. Ahmedabad, 6th November 1890. 31. I commenced my tour in Gujarát here on the 6th. I branded 1 mare for horse and 3 for pony. Cottenham ... T. B. E. Elzevier ... Do. Dispatch ... ... N. T. E. Harvester ... Arab. January ... ... Do. Augrya ... ... Do. 32. I also inspected the stallions noted in the margin and found them in good condition. I noticed that the stallions did not get sufficient exercise and I requested the District officers to give them more. 33. It was reported to me that the T. B. E. stallion "Elzevier" was not in favour with the breeders, being a little too big; I transferred him to Deesa. Sánand, 7th November 1890. 34. Here I branded 1 mare for horse and 7 for pony. Viramgám, 9th November 1890. 35. At Viramgám only 9 marcs were collected. I branded 1 for horse, 6 for pony and rejected 2. Pátri, 10th November 1890. 36. I next went to Pátri and branded 5 mares for horse and 4 for pony. Rájkot, 12th to 20th Nov- ember 1890. 37. My next duty was to assist at the Rájkot Horse Show. 38. The total number of exhibits was 1,190 as compared with 610 of the year before. As this show was held during the time of His Excellency the Gov- ernor's visit, all the Chiefs had assembled and they brought their horses with them. I think this is the cause of the great swelling in the number of exhibits. Ránpur, 23rd November. 39. From here I went to Ránpur in the Ahmeda- bad district and branded 12 mares for horse and re- jected 40. Uehadi, 24th November. 40. I then marched to Uehadi and branded 9 mares for horse and 2 for pony. Dhandhuka, 26th November. 41. Here I branded 5 mares for horse and 1 for pony. I intended to remain here for a couple of days in order to give breeders a chance of getting their mares branded; but I could not do so as I received orders to attend the Civil Veterinary Conference held at Poona on the 29th November and following days, under the authority of B 6866 Government Resolution in the Revenue Department, No. 8083A., dated 15th November 1890. Poona, 29th November to 2nd December. 42. The conference was held from 29th November to the 2nd of December. The proceedings are reviewed by Government in Reso- lution No. 2110 in the Revenue Department, dated 23rd March 1891. Bárejdi, 4th December. 43. From Poona I returned to Bárejdi in the Ahmedabad district and branded 1 mare for horse and 3 for pony. Ráipur, 5th December. 44. I then proceeded to Ráipur and branded 1 mare for horse and 8 for pony. Harsol, 8th December. 45. At Harsol on the 8th, only 8 mares were branded for pony. Parántíj, 12th December. 46. I arrived here on the 12th December and branded 9 mares for horse and 18 for pony. I inspected the stallion "Hassan" and found him in good condition. Sádra, 13th December 1890. 47. I visited Sádra in Mahi Kántha and branded 1 mare for horse and 3 for pony. Dángarva, 14th December 1890. 48. Here I branded only 2 mares for pony. Messána, 15th December 1890. 49. Thence I marched to Messána and branded 4 mares for pony. Deesa, 17th December 1890. 50. I inspected 29 mares and branded 2 for horse, 17 for pony and reject- ed 10. Out of the mares selected for horse brand, Major Elliot bought a very nice mare as a remount. 51. I inspected the Government stallions "Cottenham" and "Majeeb" and found them in excellent condition. "Cottenham" was transferred to Ahmedabad in place of "Elzevier," and "Majeeb" was transferred to Kaira in place of "Melton." Palánpur, 19th December. 52. Here 53 mares were collected for my inspection and I branded 41 for horse and 9 for pony. The mares were a good lot. Mehmadabad, 21st December. 53. From here I went to Mehmadabad in the Kaira District and branded 2 mares for horse and 12 for pony. Kaira, 22nd December. 54. At Kaira I inspected the Government stallion "Melton" and found him in good health. I transferred him to Deesa. Here 17 mares were brought in and 1 was branded for horse, 14 for pony and rejected 2. Ahmednagar, 29th December 1890 to 1st January 1891. 55. My next duty was to assist at the Ahmednagar Horse Show held in the last week in December. The show compares very favourably with that of Poona: though the number of exhibits was small, the quality was good. I think the decrease in the number was owing to the uncertainty of having the show till the last moment. A good many of the young stock of the district had been bought by the Remount Depôt. 56. During the show I branded 16 mares for horse and 19 for pony. Mainstay ... ... Arab. Friendship ... do. Mystic ... do. Deshmookh ... do. Glendale ... ... Arab. Orator ... ... do. Sirdar ... ... do. Zamindar ... do. 57. I inspected the stallions noted in the margin and found them in good condition. The pony stallion "Sailor Boy" was trans- ferred to Shevgaon and the pony stallion "Mystic" retained at Ahmednagar. Jacobabad, 9th to 17th January 1891. 58. I attended the Horse Show held here in the second week of January 1891. In all 1,404 animals were exhibited. Many of the exhibits belonged to the Beluchis of the Upper Sind Frontier District.
7 59. In the Remount Class 182 animals were exhibited. The following number of animals were purchased for remount purposes. By Army Remount Department ... ... ... 57 By Police ... ... ... ... 68 By Sind Regiments ... ... ... ... 22 Total ... 147 60. This year Lieutenant Hamilton had come from Multan to purchase mules, which was a step in the right direction. 61. The show was a success both in number and quality. 62. During the show I branded 48 mares for horse, 38 for pony and 80 for donkey. Sobersides ... ... T. B. E. Shrewsbury ... ... do. Sir Peter ... ... N. T. E. Cupid ... ... ... do.

I next went to Shikárpur and branded 4 mares for horse and 3 for pony. The Mukhtiárkar of the place seems to have taken very little trouble to collect the mares. Rádhan, 22nd January 1891. 66. Here I branded 1 mare for horse and 2 for pony. No pains were taken to collect the mares. I did not see the Mukh- tiárkar of the táluka nor any of his subordinates. Lárkhána, 24th January 1891. 67. Here 13 mares were branded for horse and 13 for pony. Rohri, 28th January 1891. 68. I proceeded here on the 28th, and out of the wretched lot presented for my inspection, I branded 9 for pony and 3 for donkey. Mirpur, 29th January 1891. 69. At Mirpur 55 mares were brought in for my inspection and I brand- ed 4 for horse and 41 for donkey. Many of the mares were fit for mule-breeding. Karáchi, 1st to 6th Feb- ruary 1891. 70. From here I went to Karáchi and remained there till the 7th of February, on which date I sailed for Mándvi. On my way to Karáchi, I inspected the stallion "Sham- mer" standing at Shewan in the Karáchi District and found him in fair condition, but not well groomed. While at Karáchi, I was engaged in my office work. Mándvi, 8th and 9th Feb- ruary 1891. 71. I arrived at Cutch Mándvi on the 8th and inspected 23 mares and branded 8 for horse. Bhúj, 10th to 14th February 1891. 72. There was a Horse Show at this time at Bhúj. About 151 animals were exhibited at this show. The quality was superior to that of last year. His Highness the Ráo of Cutch takes great interest in horse-breeding operations; but I should like to see the young stock by Government sires out of good mares grow into larger and more suitable animals for remount purposes.
8 73. I purchased 10 young stock for the Ahmednagar Remount Rearing Depôt. Hampton ... T. B. E. Scindia ... ... Arab. Tahlim ... ... Do. Glennore ... Do. 74. I inspected the marginally noted stallions and found them in good health. I found the Govern- ment stallion "Tahlim" very slow coverer, and as he was old and nearly worn out, I recommended him to be cast and sold. Here I branded 12 mares for horse and rejected 20. Sibi, 20th to 27th February 1891. 75. I arrived here on the morning of the 28th. 76. This year the show was held on the 23rd February 1891 and following days. About 837 horses competed for prizes as compared with 706 in last year. The show was a greater success than that of any previous year, both in number and quality. 77. The following is the detail of the number of remounts and young stock purchased for Government:9 General Remarks. 84. Stabling.10 Horses. Ponies. Total.

The increase in the number of stallions during the year has been as shown below :11 Of the total strength 104 (including Beluchistán) on the register, the number actually employed at stud work during the year was 90. The remainder were at Depôt either for acclimatization, or temporarily unfit for service. Map of horse- breeding operations. 101. Appendix IV is the map of horse-breeding operations, on which are noted the names of stands where stallions are located in the breeding districts of Bombay Presidency and Beluchistán. Horse stands are shown in red and donkey stands in green type. 102. Appendices V and VI show the number and classes of horse and donkey stallions, the number of branded mares and the number of coverings at each stand. 103. Appendices VII and VIII show the number of days and the stand at which each horse and donkey stallion was employed; also the total number of mares covered during the year. 104.

The results of the coverings of 1889-90 are given in Appendix XI. Undoubtedly the produce must be more than what has been shown in this state- ment; but owing to the reasons given in paragraph 84 of the Annual Report of this Department for 1888-89, no more information is forthcoming.

The demand for the services of the donkey stallions for mule-breeding is increasing. The four donkeys received during this year are much appreciated. I have indented for two donkey stallions. Cost of keep, &c., of the donkey stallions. 128. The cost of feed, keep and attendants, including transit charges of the donkey stallions, is shown in Appendix XVII. The figures noted below give the general annual average during the past nine years:16 133. This shows an increase of 2,729 if compared with the figures of the last year. This year the figures of Quetta and Ahmednagar Shows are added to this. Besides there was an increase in the number of exhibits at all the other shows. Cost of the Department. 134. The expenses incurred for the Superintendent and his office establish- ment are Rs. 9,922-1-5 against Rs. 9,545-1-1. This shows an increase of Rs. 377-0-4, which is due to the travelling expenses of the establishment from Jacobabad to Cutch and back to Sibi. 135. The total expenses of Rs. 68,502-0-7 have been divided into the fol- lowing sub-heads :[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]

36 No. 1986 OF 1891. Poona, 15th August 1891. Forwarded with compliments. The following points are noted as im- portant :Annual Administration Report of the Department of Horse-Breeding Operations for 1890-91. No. 1259. REVENUE DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 19th February 1892. Letter from the Under Secretary to the Government of India in the Revenue and Agri- cultural Department (Horse-Breeding and Agricultural Department), No. 16382 *Year. Number. 1887-88..................... 835 1888-89.................... 465 1889-90................ 706 the report that Mr. Grainger's long-deferred tour in the Belgaum, Dhárwár and Bijápur Districts was not attended with any satisfactory results. As compared with the figures* for the preceding three years, the number of mares (388) branded during the year in the Deccan and Southern Marátha Country shows a considerable falling off, which is attributed partly to the wretched condition of the animals brought up and partly to the want of co-opera- tion on the part of some of the Táluka officers in collecting mares. The District officers should be requested to issue strict instructions to the Táluka officials in their respective charges to render every possible assistance to the Superintend- ent during his annual inspection tours. The question of making some change in the branding system now in force and of generally improving the present system of Horse-Breeding Operations is under the consideration of Government, and separate orders on the subject will be passed in due course on receipt of the report called for from the Director of Land Records and Agriculture in Government reference No. 6082, dated 5th September 1891. 4. Out of the 104 stallions in charge of the Superintendent the average number employed at stud work throughout the year is reported to have been 87.1 as against 85.66 in the preceding year. The total number of mares covered by the horse stallions during the year was 3,270 and the average number per stallion was 37.5, while the corresponding figures for 1889-90 were 3,143 and 36.34. The results of the coverings of 1889-90 ascertained during the year under review also show a slight improvement over those recorded in the preceding year, the total number of foals being 813 (430 colts and 383 fillies) as compared with 769 (419 colts and 350 fillies) in 1889-90. 5. The number of remounts purchased for this Presidency during the year under review was 435, of which 178 were for the Army, 90 for the Police and 167 for the Ahmednagar Remount Depôt. Of the remounts bought, 168 were the produce of Government stallions. Mr. Grainger reports that at the com- mencement of the year there was an outbreak of glanders in the Remount Depôt at Ahmednagar, which compelled him to remain at that place for nearly a month and which was successfully checked. 6. In addition to 146 colts gelded at the Ahmednagar Remount Depôt by the Salutri in charge of the depôt, 127 horses were castrated during- the year in different parts of this Presidency. This latter number exceeds by 55 the number operated on in 1889-90 and by 45 the average number of the preced- ing three years. 7. There were 23 donkey stallions on the Superintendent's books on 1st April 1890. To these 4 new stallions imported from Italy were added during the year, while 2 were transferred to the Bengal register and one was sold, thus leaving 24 in charge of the Superintendent at the close of the year. The total number of mares covered by the donkey stallions was 868 as against 821 in the previous year but the resulting number of mules fell from 73 in 18-89-90 to 61, figures which cannot be regarded as even approximately accurate. 8. The total expenditure was Rs. 68,502-0-7, of which Rs. 13,964-9-7 were debited to Local Funds and Rs. 8,418 were paid by the Government of India. The cost to Provincial Revenues of the year's operations was thus Rs. 46,119-7-0. 9. Although the percentage of foals dropped to coverings of the previous years compares not unfavourably with the results in such other provinces as Government can compare them with, this percentage cannot be regarded as a satisfactory return for the cost of the operations, if the figures given are to be relied on. Either the registers are quite untrustworthy, or improvement in the percentage of foals dropped to mares covered is possible. If the former is the
3 case, the Director of Land Records and Agriculture should consider if improve- ment cannot be secured. If the latter, the Superintendent of Horse-Breeding Operations should pay especial attention to the results of each stallion's work. It will be of convenience to Government if columns can be added to Appendix VII, showing against each horse his coverings of the previous year, and the foals attributed to him in the year of report. 10. This report does not relate to the period in which the Department has been supervised by the Director of Land Records and Agriculture, and that may account for the baldness of Mr. Cappel's review. The Director's next review should contain a comprehensive examination and discussion of the opera- tions of the Department and of their results. 11. It appears from a report submitted by the Superintendent of Horse- Breeding Operations that the annual district returns required for his report were not received from some of the District officers till late in July last, and the report could not therefore be submitted to the Government of India by the prescribed date. To ensure the punctual submission of the report to the Gov- ernment of India in future, the Collectors and Political Agents concerned should be requested to transmit their returns to the Superintendent by the 1st of May in each year.

Annual Administration Report for the year 1891-92. No. 987 OF 1892. FROM J. W. A. MORGAN, ESQUARE Superintendent, Horse-breeding Operations: To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, REVENUE DEPARTMENT Bombay. Office of the Superintendent, Department of Horse-breeding Operations, Bombay Presidency, Ahmednagar, 27th June 1892. SIR, I have the honour to submit, for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council, the detailed report of the working of this Department, to- gether with statistical returns for the year 1891-92. 2. I took over charge of this Department on the 20th of May last, and consequently this report alludes to a period prior to my assuming charge. 3. As this is a continuation of my predecessor's report, I have attached copy of it to this. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, J. W. A. MORGAN, Superintendent, Horse-breeding Operations, Bombay Presidency.
GOVERNMENT OF BOMBAY. DEPARTMENT OF HORSE-BREEDING OPERATIONS. ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1891-92. My tours in the Horse-breeding Districts. 1st April to 2nd May 1891. At the beginning of the year under report I was at Ahmednagar and re- mained there till the 19th of April, and then proceeded to Bombay to assist in the examination of the students of the Bombay Veterinary College, which lasted till the 2nd of May. Ahmednagar. 2. I then returned to Ahmednagar and remained there till the 4th of August, with the exception of a visit to Poona. 3. This year also there was an outbreak of glanders in the Remount Rear- ing Depôt, Ahmednagar, and as there was no other Veterinary Officer, I was obliged to remain at the head-quarters. I had to make a bi-weekly inspection of all the horses in the Depôt; therefore it was quite impossible for me to go on tour. Besides these inspections, precautionary measures had to be adopted, and I am glad to state that they were successful. 4. Here I would again urge the desirability of a Veterinary Surgeon being specially appointed to the Remount Depôt, as this prevented me from attending my immediate duties as Superintendent, Horse-breeding Department. I can only render veterinary aid or supervision during my short visits to Ahmednagar. 5. I am glad to say that my services have been fully acknowledged by the Director of Army Remount Department. Copy of his letter, No. 816, dated 30th June 1891, to General Superintendent, Horse-breeding Operations, is given below for perusal:4 Rahata, 20th August 1891. 12. At Rahata on the 20th of August I branded 4 mares for horse and 14 for pony. Kopargaon, 21st August 1891. 13. I next went to Kopargaon and branded 16 mares for pony. I in- spected the pony stallion "Glendale" and found him suffering from skin disease, and I recommended treat- ment, &c., and the pony was cured. Málegaon, 30th August 1891. 14. Thence I proceeded to Málegaon in the Násik District and branded 58 mares for pony and rejected 100. The mares were a poor lot. 15. I inspected the Government stallion "Cruiser" and found him in excellent condition. Nándgaon. 31st August 1891. 16. From here I marched to Nándgaon in the same district and branded 51 mares for pony and rejected 310. The mares were a poor lot. The pony stallion "Cyclone" was in good condition. Chálisgaon. 1st September 1891. 17. My next visit was to Chálisgaon in the Khándesh District where I branded 66 mares for pony. Here I inspected the Government stallion "Pinto" and found him in good condition. Dhulia, 2nd September 1891. 18. From here I went to Dhulia and branded 33 mares for pony and rejected 47. I found the stallion "Torpedo" in good condition. Poona, 16th to 22nd Sep- tember 1891. 19. My next duty was to assist at the Poona Horse Show. The show was not so successful as in former years. This may be accounted for by the scarcity of forage and disinclina- tion of breeders to bring their animals to the show owing to expense. Adonis ... ... T. B. E. Merry Logs ... N. T. E. Model ... ...

During the show 20 mares were branded for horse and 3 for pony. I inspected the stallions noted in the mar- gin and found them in excellent condition. Quetta, 29th September to 4th October 1891. 21.I attended the Horse Show held here on the 2nd and 3rd of Octo- ber 1891. This was the second show. The show was a better one, and I am of opinion that with a little encouragement from the Government of India it would be a decided success, and its stability assured. The prizes for the next show must be increased. 22.A large number of horses and young stock was purchased by the Officers Commanding 7th Bombay Lancers, the 2nd Bengal Lancers, the Zhob Levies and the Remount Agent, Punjab. 23.During the show I branded 15 mares for horse and rejected 20. I also inspected the stallions in Beluchistán and found them in good condition. 24.Thence I returned to Ahmednagar. On my way here I inspected the stallions at Ahmedabad and found the English horse "Cottenham" in very poor condition, and recommended the man in charge to subject him to a course of tonic medicine and a total change of diet. 25.On the 9th, 10th and 11th there was a Horse Show at Ahmednagar, but I was unable to attend it owing to sickness, and Veterinary Surgeon Sharp acted for me. I learn from him that the show was a successful one. Mystic ... ... Arab Friendship ... ... Do. Sailor Boy ... ... Do. Glendale ... ... Do. Mainstay ... Arab. Deshmukh ... Do. Orator ... Do.

At this time I transferred "Clipper" to Karjat. 27. Rajkot Horse Show was fixed to be held on the 20th of November, but it was postponed on account of scarcity of fodder, &c., in Káthiáwár.

I inspected the stallions noted in the margin, and found them in good condition. Rádhan, 10th December 1891. 29. From Lárkhána I proceeded to Rádhan and branded 5 mares for horse, 27 for pony, 7 for donkey, and rejected 75. Jacobabad, 4th January 1892. 30. At Jacobabad on the 4th of January 1892 I branded 33 mares for horse, 29 for pony, 15 for don- key, and rejected 60. Thul, 6th January 1892. 31. From here I marched to Thul in the same district and brand- ed 8 mares for horse, 32 for donkey and rejected 40. Shikárpur, 8th to 14th January 1892. 32. My next duty was to attend the Shikárpur Horse Show, which was held on the second Monday in January 1892. 33.Although the number of exhibits was not as large as the last year, yet the quality was superior. The decrease in the number was attributed to the scarcity of fodder in two tálukas of the Upper Sind Frontier District. 34.The Remount Class was well attended. The quality was superior to that of the last two years. Only 52 purchases have been made against 162 in 1890 and 147 in 1891. Many purchases were made some time before the show by the local regiments and Remount Department, and therefore the number of purchases made in the show must be smaller. One mule was purchased during the show, but it is believed 29 were purchased after the show was over. Shikárpur Stallions. Royal Visit ... ... Arab. Waverly ... ... Do. Latchkey ... ... Do.

I transferred him to Bábugarh in consultation with the General Superintendent, Horse-breeding Operations. 36. During the show I branded 15 mares for horse, 1 for pony, and rejected 12. Mirpur, 16th January 1892. 37. I arrived here on the 16th of January and branded 6 mares for horse, none for pony, and 25 for donkey. Phulji, 18th January 1892. 38.

Here many mares were collected for my in- spection, but they were a poor lot and in bad condition, and I had to reject them. Bhúj, 29th January 1892. 41. I then marched to Bhúj in Cutch and branded 5 mares for horse and 1 for pony. The Horse Show here was postponed owing to the scarcity of fodder and water. I inspect- ed the marginally noted stallions and found them in good condition. I was not able to procure young stock for the Ahmednagar Remount Depôt, as both the Political Agent and His Highness the Ráo of Cutch had gone to Bombay, and what was brought for my inspection were much below the standard.

There was an increase of 108 animals attending the Ahmedabad Horse Show if compared with the figures of the year before. It is to be regretted that the quality of the exhibits showed no improvement, and I believe it is due to the scarcity and dearness of fodder. Many of the animals were half starved. Harvester ... ...

From Ahmedabad I went to Deesa and inspected the Government stal- lions "Melton" and "Eleavier" and found them in bad condition, and the latter horse suffering from a severe strained hock. I recommended him to be sent to the Royal Artillery sick lines, and Veterinary Surgeon Peacocke reports that he is improving. Sibi, 26th February to 6th March 1892. 46. My next duty was to attend the Sibi Horse Show. There was a slight increase in the number of exhibits compared with the figures of the last year. 47.

29 REVIEW BY THE DIRECTOR, LAND RECORDS AND AGRICULTURE. No. 3548 OF 1892. Poona, 10th December 1892. Forwarded with compliments. 2. Veterinary Captain Grainger was in charge of the Department during the year under report; he was succeeded, on the 20th May, 1892, by Veterinary Captain Morgan, who has added to the report, written by his predecessor, notes on the statistics appended. * This office No. 3513, dated 10th December 1892. 3. It is desirable that the form of these reports, which is extremely faulty, both in respect of the arrangement of the text and of the appended statistical information, should be amended. On this subject full proposals have been made separately* on a reference received from the Government of India. Poona. Karachi. Ahmadnagar. Hyderabad. Násik. Shikárpur. Khándesh. Upper Sind Ahmadabad. Frontier. 4. Veterinary Captain Grainger visited the districts noted in the margin and also the following places on duty:30 9. The number of mares branded was 809, which, compared with last year's figure (1,046), is a decrease of 22.66 per cent. This is stated by the Superintendent to be also mainly due to the low condition of the mares, the district stock returns showing, further, that a good many animals were sold by their owners owing to seasonal causes. But the chief fall is in Gujarát, and there is a fall of 40 per cent. in Beluchistán; in both these tracts the scarcity of fodder was less marked than elsewhere, so that branding operations might apparently have been more extensive. In view of the under-working of the stallions, pointed out in the preceding paragraph, this is a matter which calls for immediate attention. 10. The total number of horse and pony stallions (99), including 5 addi- tions during the year, has decreased by 5, six horses having died and four being sold as incompetent. The distribution of the horses was as follows:31 15. The average annual cost per horse-stallion (Rs. 385-12-2) is the high- est of 13 years past, with the exception of 1878-79. The high price of food and fodder consequent on a bad season sufficiently accounts for this. The donkey stallions, stationed in Sind almost exclusively, were kept at a lower cost than last year (Rs. 254-6-7 against Rs. 272-5-10). 16. The total expenditure on horse-breeding amounted to Rs. 66,767 against Rs. 68,502 in 1890-91. The amount defrayed from Provincial Revenues was Rs. 42,844. Local Funds contributed Rs. 13,873, and the balance of Rs. 10,049 was paid out of Imperial Revenues for the cost of stallions in Beluchis- tán and for prizes at the Sibi and Quetta shows. 17. The report is forwarded later than usual, as it has been necessary to consider with it the other matters of reference alluded to, and also questions relating to the general improvement of horse-breeding operations (report pre- paring for press for submission to Government through the Revenue Commis- sioners), all of which have called for careful and laborious consideration.

Annual Report of the Department of Horse-Breeding Operations for 1891-92. No. 2451. REVENUE DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 8th April 1893. Letter from Mr. J. K. Grainger, Superintendent, Horse-Breeding Operations, No. 491, dated 15th April 18922 memorandum that the services of stallions have not been fully utilized for years past deserves the special notice of the Superintendent, who should use every endeavour to show better results in future. 3. The total number of remounts purchased during the year at the several horse-shows held in the Presidency proper, Sind and Beluehistán was 251 for this Presidency and 184 for other Provinces as compared with 435 and 137 respectively purchased in the preceding year. Of the 251 remounts purchased for this Presidency, only 34 or 13 per cent. were ascertained to have been the produce of Government stallions. The attention of the Superintendent should be drawn to the remarks made on the subject in paragraph 7 of the Director's memorandum, and that officer should be requested to furnish the information required by the Director in future reports. 4. The results of the mule-breeding operations of the year under review show a slight improvement over those of the previous year. The total number of mares covered by the donkey-stallions and the average number per stallion rose from 868 and 413 in 1890-91 to 1,019 and 43.32 in 1891-92. There was also an increase of 27 in the number of mules (88) ascertained during the year to have been the produce of Government stallions as compared with the cor- responding figure (61) of the preceding year. 5. The total expenditure of the Department during the year amounted to Rs. 66,767 against Rs. 68,502 in 1890-91. Of this sum, Rs. 13,873 were con- tributed by the Local Funds and Rs. 10,050 by the Government of India, and the balance of Rs. 42,844 was defrayed from the Provincial Revenues. W. L.
