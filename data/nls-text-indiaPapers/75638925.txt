His tour ranged in by districts, viz., Bijnor and Garhwal where he surveyed the sheep-breeding industry carried out by the people of these two places. 12. Mr. T. S. Davies, officiating 1st Deputy Superintendent, was leave twice in the year, from the 2nd May to the 1st September, 1925 and again from the 18th September, 1922 to the 1st February, 1923, c account of illness.

He was deputed to the Gorakhpur district enquire into an outbreak of surra which was badly prevalent in the Chat paran and Saran districts adjoining Gorakhpur. He attended outbres of rinderpest and haemorrhagic septicaemia, which appeared in a virul form in the districts of Ballia and Azamgarh, where he personally conduct inoculation. I.( 3 ) 17. Demonstrations and lectures on veterinary subjects were given members of the staff in some of the important fairs and shows. II.( 4 ) 27. Foot and mouth disease..( 5 ) I study of methods of research in obscure cases, which cannot be treated veniently by the district veterinary staff. Forty cases were received treated with satisfactory results. 35. Cases of cattle poisoning were reported from four districts where district authorities have investigated them and dealt with the persons cerned. See table V. 36. Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries.( 6 ) (3) POULTRY-BREEDING. 44. The small demonstration poultry run at the Badshahbagh Resear Station is continuing to do good work. (4) EQUINE (UNDER LOCAL BODIES.) (i) Horse and pony stallions. See table X. 45. At the beginning of the year there were 73 horse and p stallions at stud belonging to this department. 46. Six stallions were purchased during the year, two were castra and sold, being unfit for stud work, two died and eight destroyed, thus le ing a balance of 67 at the end of the year. See table XI. 47. Fifty-six sires were employed at stud work, during the year a the number of mares covered by these stallions amounted to 2,964, bei a decrease of 203 as compared with last year's figures. The decrease due to the employment of fewer stallions owing to the closing of the star in the districts of Moradabad, Pilibhit, Jaunpur and Gonda. 48. The functions of this department, in so far as horse-breeding concerned, are confined to the improvement of the indigenous horse pony for general utility purposes in those tracts other than the selected districts of Aligarh, Muzaffarnagar, Bulandshahr and Meerut, it is noticeable that these tracts which were primarily considered uns able for horse-breeding are now proving themselves capable of produci a type of animal which may be confidently expected to still furth improve. (ii) Donkey stallions. See tables X & XI. 49. At the commencement of the year there were 18 provin donkeys on the register. Three died and three destroyed being old and us for stud work, thus leaving a balance of 12 at the close of the year Twelve were at stud work and covered 626 mares, being a decrease 129. The decrease is due to the following causes, (1) most of the donkeys are old and (require replacement, (2) fewer number employed stud work. 50. There appears to be still an increasing demand for the services donkey stallions for mule-breeding, but the limited number availa renders it difficult to meet the demand. It is practically impossible obtain good jacks in India and it will, therefore, be absolutely necess to make some arrangements for importing them in the future if we w to foster the mule-breeding industry. Correspondence is going on w the Army Remount departments to purchase some good American j donkeys for us during the present year. Fairs and shows. 51. Wherever possible, fairs and shows were attended by the offic of the Civil Veterinary department. In most of these fairs and she veterinary instruments and remedies were exhibited, and magic lant demonstrations on animal subjects were displayed to the cultivat attending the fairs. See table XIV. 52. Rupees three thousand and twenty-six ware distributed in pri at Saharanpur, Bulandshahr, Agra, Budaun, Moradabad, Shahjahanp Cawnpore, Ballia and Bara Banki,
( 7 ) IV.( 8 ) This is a matter to be deeply regretted as, at the present time, veterinary staff in moat districts is the lowest possible to run the dist with any amount of efficiency. If the boards persist It will mean there will be an increase of deaths from contagious diseases, and the an appalling loss to the agriculturists for whom the Veterinary departn is primarily intended. 62. My thanks are due to Captain W. H. Priston, and Khan Salt S. Niaz Mohammad for the energetic and able way they carried out the duties in their respective circles. I am also indebted to the Dep Superintendents, Mr. T. S. Davies, S. M. Raza Husain, and Pandit Chand for the assistance and help they have rendered me during the year The subordinate staff, both veterinary and clerical, have continued to w most satisfactorily during the year. I wish to bring to the notice Government the valuable help rendered to me by my head assist Babu Srish Chandra Bhuttacharjya. S. G. M. HICKEY, CAPTAIN, M.R.C.V.S., Offg.

The small demonstration poultry run at Badshahbagh Reseai Station is continuing to do good work and research of diseases among for are being investigated in the laboratory. (4) EQUINE (UNDER LOCAL BODIES). (i) Horse and pony stallions. See Table X. 46. At the commencement of the year there were 67 horse and por stallions belonging to this department. 47. No stallions were purchased during the year. One was castrai and sold, being unfit for stud work and three died, thus leaving a balance of 63 at the end of the year. SeeTable XI. 48. Fifty-three sires were employed at stud work during the year and the number of mares covered by them amounted to 2,780,. being decrease of 184 as compared with last year's figures. The decrease is due the fact of the closing of two stands in the districts of Shahjahanpur a Farrukhabad respectively and want of new stallions to replace the old on which are being proved unfit for stud purposes, 49. As mentioned last year, the functions of this department, as far horse breeding is concerned, are confined to the improvement of the ing genous horse and pony from a point of general utility in those trae other than the four selected districts. The past years have seen a very considerable improvement in the quality of the animals in these unselected districts which fully justifies the small expenditure incurred in the direction. 50. During my tour in the breeding tracts of the unselected districts I was shown some young stock, the progeny of the provincial stallions which showed a continued improvement in the blood of these animals. (ii) Donkey Stallions. See Tables X and XI. 51. At the beginning of the year there were 12 provincial donkeys on the register, two were purchased from the Army Remount department at cost of Rs. 4,189 and one died, thus leaving a balance of 13. Of these, 10 were stud work and the number of mares covered by them amounted to 500 as against 626 of last year, being a decrease of 126. The decrease is due to many of these becoming old and unfit for stud purposes. They will bo replaced gradually as funds are available. Fairs and Shows. See Table XIV, 52. I personally attended the Saharanpur Fair and Show and where- ever possible, officers of this department attended these in their respective circles and sub-divisions. Temporary veterinary dispensaries were opened in several fairs. Interesting specimens and veterinary instruments and drugs, etc., dealing with the treatment of agricultural stock were on View at Batesar, Etawah. Moradabad, and Saharanpur.
( 7 ) Rupees one thousand and four hundred were contributed towards prize rds and this amount was distributed at Saharanpur, Bulandshahr, asar, Budaun, Moradabad, Shahjahanpur, Dadri, Unao, and Bara Banki.

I am to ask, therefore, for a further description of the work done at your station and the cost of it, how the work differs from that done by the United Provinces Poultry Association, and for your opinion as to the need of continuing the work done by you. 4. Government have no further remarks to offer. The report is a record of satisfactory work, and they have read it with interest.

I.( 3 ) 15 One veterinary assistant surgeon attached to the laboratory of the Veterinary Adviser's office was sent for training at the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research at Muktesar and returned after having attended a two months' course, qualifying himself in different subjects. This man will be of great assistance in the laboratory. It is proposed to send three more veterinary assistant surgeons there during the current financial year. 16. Leaflets in Urdu and Hindi dealing with cattle disease in India were freely distributed to villagers and cultivates through the agency of the department and at the different fairs and shows.

Prompt action for the segregation of the affected cases was taken and inoculations were organized with a satisfactory result. Wherever the district staff was considered insufficient to cope with the disease, additional men were sent from the headquarters staff to help the district men. In- oculations were carried out in 43 districts against 36 last year. See Table III. 25. Foot-and-mouth disease.( 5 ) being paid to sanitation and hygiene as well as care in feeding and general management. Had there been no suspension of the supply of serum, the number of inoculations would have been something like one lac. See Table IV. 32. During the year under review there were 32 itinerating and 113 stationary veterinary assistant surgeons placed in charge of dispensaries who toured in districts at the time of emergency or to attend outbreaks. They visited 12,396 villages and treated 19,683 animals for diseases other than those already reported on. In addition to this, they castrated 368 animals and attended 42,944 cases of contagious diseases exclusive of those treated in hospitals and dispensaries. 33. Investigation of disease.( 6 ) The total number of cases treated at these institutions was :( 7 ) request, it is hoped that this system will revive the interest of the owners to a greater extent than at present to keep a good number of mares for the improvement of horse-breeding and incidentally benefiting them- selves by the sale of the foals at a higher price in the open markets, at fairs and shows. Good young stock the progeny of provincial stallions were seen in the horse-breeding districts in the course of inspection tours of officers of this department. (ii) Donkey-stallions. See Tables X and XI. 47. At the commencement of the year there were 13 provincial donkeys on the register. As there was neither any casualty nor purchase, the balance remained the same at the end of the year. Of these 12 were at stud work and covered 440 mares as against 500 of last year, being a decrease of 60. This decrease is due to many of them requiring replacement, being old and unfit for stud purposes. Arrangements are being made to replace them by new ones. See Table XIV. 48. Fairs and shows.( 8 ) is often found necessary to depute these men at the shortest notice regardless of time or season, to any part of the province on urgent duty connected with inoculation and investigation. They also relieved the district board veterinary staff as leave reserves. 52. As remarked last year, certain veterinary assistant surgeons who appeared incorrigible have shown improvement in their work. 53. I regret to have again to report that certain district boards have still objected to the transfer of veterinary assistant surgeons for their bad work. Such objections heavily handicap improvement of the veterinary work in the districts. 54. I regret to report the death of one Veterinary Inspector and five veterinary assistant surgeons during the year. One veterinary assistant surgeon retired from January last, having reached 55 years of age. 55. A new set of draft rules concerning the veterinary staff employed by the. district boards is under the consideration of Government and will replace the present Manual of the Civil Veterinary department. 56. The following Veterinary Inspectors and veterinary assistant surgeons are commended for good work :( 9 ) suppression of cattle disease owing to the tremendously large number of animals concerned and the small staff to cope with it. Six veterinary assistant surgeons were employed during the migrating season and deputed to inspect and inoculate when necessary at certain halting stages fre- quented by animals "en route." With this small staff and so many animals to deal with it is impossible to admit that much progress was made. The question is to be discussed by a Cattle Committee some time in June. 60. From time to time the question of dealing with rabies in dogs has been put forward and recommendations made thereon by Government on the suggestion of the first sectional meeting of veterinary officers held at Lahore on 24th March, 1919, but up to the present it is regretted that little or no action has been taken, with the result that the disease is rapidly on the increase. This is noticeable chiefly amongst ownerless and pariah dogs which are allowed to roam, more especially at such places as railway stations and bazars. Last year in one district alone no fewer than eighty suspected cases were dealt with, resulting in many people being bitten and having to proceed to the Pasteur Institute, Kasauli, for treatment. A scheme might be considered allowing these wretched ownerless animals to bo collected and detained for a short space of time, then if not claimed within a given period they may be destroyed. This would un- doubtedly be a step in the right direction, taking into consideration the great source of danger, rabid animals are to the public. 61. Too many thanks cannot be extended to Raja Sripal Singh Sahib for his assistance and extreme kindness in presenting to the department for stud purposes two stallions which will be highly appreciated by the horse-breeders of the province. One is "Rainbow," a handsome Arab of substance and good tempera- ment, ridden by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales when in Lucknow, the other a most useful animal of good type called "Bally Apple." These stallions will greatly add to the improvement of horse- breeding. 62. There is still much slackness in reporting contagious disease out- breaks ; this has been complained of in previous annual reports (vide paragraph 60 of last year's report). Measures are being considered for its improvement and proposals are already before the Government. 63. On the whole there is a distinct improvement in the working of the veterinary subordinate staff and many veterinary assistant surgeons are displaying keenness and enthusiasm in their work. The Officiating Superintendents, viz., Khan Sahib Shaikh Niaz Muham- mad, in charge Allahabad circle, and Mr. T. S. Davies, in charge Agra circle, have many thanks due to them for the good work they have done. They have both been a great help to the department and have carried out their work in a thorough and conscientious manner ; also many thanks are due to Deputy Superintendent Saiyid Raza Husain, in charge Jhansi circle, for his good work and the way he has personally attended epidemics in his circle is worthy of note. With the above names should be included Officiating Deputy Superintendent Muhammad Shah, in charge Moradabad
( 10 ) circle, who has also displayed much interest and thoroughness in his work. 64. The work of the clerical staff has been quite satisfactory, the staff at present being the minimum that could be expected to cope with the heavy amount of work to be done. As far as can be seen, each mem- ber has carried out his duties satisfactorily. As in previous years, the name of the Head Assistant, Babu Srish Chandra Bhattacharya cannot be too strongly mentioned for the good work he has done ; through his perseverance and thoroughness he has been a great help ; also a word of appreciation is due to the Head Clerk Babu Satya Kumar Mukerjee for the painstaking way he has carried out his duties.

No. 2768/III-6 (Maximum limit of report( ii ) LIST OF APPENDICES. Pages. Table no. II.Annual Report on the Civil Veterinary Department, United Provinces, 192S-26. 1. The administration report on the department for the year ending March 31, 1926, is herewith submitted. 2. I was on leave up to November 1, 1925, and on my return I held charge of the department throughout the rest of the year. 3. Captain W. H. Priston, Superintendent, Agra circle, officiated as Veterinary Adviser to Government, United Provinces, during my absence on leave and reverted to his substantive appointment on my return. 4. Khan Sahib Shaikh Niaz Mohammed officiated as Superintendent, Allahabad circle, throughout the year. 5. Mr. T. S. Davies held charge of the office of the Superintendent, Agra circle, in my leave arrangement and on my return reverted to Moradabad and took over charge of his substantive appointment as Deputy Superintendent, Moradabad sub-division, from November 2, 1925. 6. Tours of officers.( 2 ) Magistrates, chairmen, district boards, and other general public inter- ested in the welfare of the department. He attended the Dewa fair, district Bara Banki, where he acted as a member of the judging com- mittee and personally delivered lectures on cattle disease, management, feed and keep of animals generally. He inspected the stallion stands at Azamgarh and Gonda. He supervised the operation made on a case of rinderpest for the supply of virulent blood to the Muktesar Laboratory. He attended district board meeting at Benares and addressed the mem- bers present in connexion with a resolution on the subject of the proposed transfer of the sadr veterinary hospital from the district to the municipal board. He attended the outbreaks of surra in the districts of Gonda and Basti. 9. Mr. T. S. Davies was on tour for 146 days and travelled 5,696 miles by rail and 886 miles by road. He visited thirteen districts in connexion with the inspection of veterinary hospitals, dispensaries and stallion stands. He attended seats of outbreaks of surra in the districts of Cawnpore, Etawah, Mainpuri and Saharanpur. He personally attended places of outbreaks of contagious cattle diseases where they were in viru- lent form. He attended the horse and cattle show organized by the Moradabad Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition held in January last and acted as a judge and secretary. He proceeded on eight months' leave out of India from March 27, 1926, and has been succeeded by Mr. Ghulam Qadir, veterinary inspector. 10. Saiyid Mohammed Raza Husain, Deputy Superintendent, Jhansi, whose services have been transferred to the Agricultural department in the cattle-breeding operations from November 1, 1925, was on tour for 113 days and travelled 3,172 miles by rail and 463 miles by road. His tour ranged in 68 villages and inspected all the dispensaries and the work of veterinary inspectors, touring veterinary assistant surgeons and stallion stands of his sub-division( 3 ) year under report up to October 1925 and subsequent to the arrangement of the transfer of Saiyid Mohammed Raza Husain to the Agricultural de- partment from November 1, 1925, up to January 17, 1926, the date on which he was superannuated, he was in charge of the Jhansi circle. He travelled 3,247 miles by rail and 1,195 miles by road and was on tour for 153 days. He inspected all the veterinary hospitals and dispen- saries and stallion stands of the Moradabad and Jhansi sub-divisions. He personally attended several outbreaks of diseases and supervised inoculations. He investigated into the outbreak of surra in the district of Moradabad and attended the Makanpur fair. 13. Consequent on Mr. T. S. Davies proceeding on eight months' leave with effect from March 27, 1926, M. Ghulam Qadir has been appoint- ed as officiating Deputy Superintendent, Moradabad sub-division. I.( 4 ) but surra amongst horses also broke out in an epidemic form in many districts. 21. Equine. ( 5 ) numerically absolutely inadequate to deal successfully with the out- break extending as it did over such a large area of mountainous tracts although the inspector was all through helping them and a temporary veterinary assistant surgeon was entertained by the board for the purpose. The ordinary dose of protective serum required for hill cattle being eighteen times that for plains animals, the demand for the material became so large that we were unable to supply it in time until fresh grant for the cost was received from Government. 28. Foot-and-mouth disease.( 6 ) out in the province was 145,956 against 65,108. This work was seriously handicapped owing to the temporary suspension of serum supply from the Muktesar Laboratory in time of urgency and need due to the delay in getting funds from Government sanctioned by instalments for the purchase of sera when the demand from the districts was very heavy, A sum of Rs. 96,669 was spent for the purchase of sera out of a total grant of Rs. 1,01,875, including the usual budget grant of Rs, 25,000. Had there been no suspension in the supply the number of inoculations would have at least reached three lakhs. It is very pleasing to note that inoculation is now looked upon by the cattle owner as the only method of getting their cattle free from diseases and in several cases applications were received from the zamindars and agriculturists to depute staff to have their animals inoculated so much so that one district board was prepared to pay the charges of rinderpest serum. 34. Inoculations against rinderpest were performed in 42 districts, the total number of cattle protected by the " serum alone " method was 115,488 in 915 outbreaks as against 44,855 in 354 outbreaks last year. The largest number, 17,788, were protected in Jhansi, while 10,559, 9,774 and 8,165 were done respectively in the districts of Muzaffarnagar, Garhwal and Gorakhpur. 35. Inoculations against haemorrhagic septicaemia were carried out in 31 districts. The total number of cattle inoculated was 30.007 in 233 outbreaks as against 19,692 in 177 outbreaks last year. 36. The total number of cattle inoculated against blackquarter by pillules and serum method was 260 and 201 in three and two outbreaks respectively. See table IV. 37. There were 28 itinerating and 124 veterinary assistant surgeons placed in charge of dispensaries who toured in the interior when required to do so. 38. During the past year there has been a considerable increase in the number of villages visited and animals treated individually by the veterinary assistant surgeons other than the epidemics which have already been dealt with. Sixteen thousand seven hundred and eighty-six villages were visited and 24,632 cases treated as against 12,396 villages visited and 19,683 cases treated in the previous year. Apart from this they castrated 430 animals and attended 74,963 cases of contagious diseases. 39. Investigation of disease.( 7 ) Besides the above, a good number of pathological specimens, parasites etc, were received, examined and stocked in the laboratory. At the request of the Dean, Faculty of Medicine, King George's Medical College, Lucknow, a large number of pathological specimens were collected through the subordinate staff, examined, diagnosed at the laboratory and supplied to the college for the purpose of comparative pathology. As regards the outbreak of surra it exceeds all the previous records. During the year the small laboratories attached to the offices of the Agra and Allahabad circles have also done a lot of work. 40. One hundred and forty-two cases of obscure nature were kept under observation at the Research and experimental station and treated with marked success. A sum of Rs. 403 was realized from the owners as treatment charges. This institution has gained much popularity and the number will greatly increase next year on construction of extra accommo- dation for which funds are sanctioned. 41. Experiment and treatment of canker, chicken pox and roup in. fowls were carried out on a very small scale owing to want of accommoda- tion. The results gained were very satisfactory. 42. As reported last year, live ticks of all sorts were collected and sent in two lots to Dr. Andrew Balfour of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which were accepted with appreciation. 43. Cattle-poisoning.( 8 ) increasing in number and from this no further proof is wanting of their utility and importance. III.( 9 ) Arrangements are required to be made for importing them from abroad, provided sufficient funds be available for the cost. A very good class of jacks can be obtained from South Africa at a moderate figure. See table XIV. 59. Fairs and shows. ( 10 ) surgeons by one each and some of the boards are desirous to increase the number of staff during the current year, but at the same time I cannot refrain to mention that the district board of Azamgarh were thinking of reducing their veterinary assistant surgeons by two and if this was allowed the animal population in the district would have been left entirely with- out provision of veterinary help during the course of epidemic. The matter has been postponed for six months after which a final declaration would be made by the board. 65. During the year under report three veterinary inspectors retired and one veterinary assistant surgeon died. V.( 11 ) Even with these averse conditions, small staff, inadequate supply of serum and faulty segregation it is pleasing to see that from year to year the department is gaining the appreciation and good will of the general public and the agricultural classes who are yearly more willing to come forward and have their animals treated both for contagious as well as non-contagious diseases. But there is heaps of room for expansion of the department if anything like a lasting benefit is to be done. 70. The question of the control of contagious diseases imported from Nepal and other Indian States bordering on the United Provinces was to be discussed along with the question in general as it affects the whole of British India at the last Agricultural Conference held at Pusa in December 1925, but it was printed too late for a general discussion and had to be postponed until a future date. 71. Although Government from time to time have issued orders on the subject of rabies to district and municipal boards but very little attention has been paid by these bodies and the Government are there- fore requested to issue strict orders to them on the matter in question. This is an important disease which should be adequately controlled at an early date by legislation as it is not only a contagious disease of the cannine race but is contracted by men and other animals through bites from rabid animals. An ever-increasing number of people have to go yearly to the Pasteur Institutes in different parts of India for treatment. 72. Every municipal board and notified area should be ordered to collect all homeless and stray dogs at certain intervals and if not claimed within a short time they should be painlessly destroyed as they are the source to a great extent for carrying the disease. It is a crying disgrace and an eyesore to visit any large Indian railway stations see the hungry, mangey, homeless pariah dogs prowling about. I know it will be con- tended that if these were destroyed you have the jackals and other wild animals who can become rabid and also the cost of destruction. In answer, I would say by destroying your pariah population you do away with a large incident towards the spread of the disease. On the point of money, a tax of, say, Rs. 2 per year per dog should be levied on all dog- owners in the large towns and notified areas and they would be given in exchange a brass disc with a number which has to be attached to a collar worn round the dogs' necks. Any dog found without such a disc should be impounded and the owner should pay a fine before the dog was released as it is done in many countries of Europe and elsewhere. 73. I should like to bring to the notice of Government the inade- quate provision for veterinary work in the two districts of Almora and Garhwal. These vast tracts of mountainous countries have only two veteri- nary assistant surgeons in each district, where it is impossible for even a very energetic man to do more than an average of 10 miles daily and where everything is transported by pack animals of various breeds and classes of animals. Almora has got two veterinary dispensaries, whereas in Garhwal there is not even one. 74. The Superintendent of the Agra circle, who toured in the Garhwal district last year, reports to me that there is an urgent and crying need for immediate adequate staff, both for the control of contagious diseases as well as veterinary dispensaries where the people can have their animals treated for non-contagious diseases. Dispensaries should be opened at, 3
( 12 ) say four recognized centres where pack animals frequently congregate, He personally inspected a large number of animals, chiefly pack mules, at Banghat and amongst which he found many cases of lameness, wounds, etc., which required immediate treatment and attention with no hospital facilities to deal with them. Besides the ordinary non-contagious diseases, such as wounds, lameness etc., there flourish nearly all the contagious diseases in an epidemic form amongst all classes of animals. These diseases being in an epidemic form are no doubt due to the smallness of the veterinary staff which work as hard as they like can only skim the surface. Also annually large numbers of pack goats succumb to contagious diseases unknown for want of investigation. The actual figures cannot be given due to the vastness of the district and primitive methods of communication. 75. Reporting of contagious diseases still continues to be bad and will be, in my opinion, until we can educate the villagers to report for themselves and the first step in the direction is that if a villager reports an outbreak of contagious disease in his village the veterinary assistant surgeon concerned should treat it as on patwari's outbreak report and proceed immediately to the seat of the outbreak. 76. There has been an all-round improvement in the working of the veterinary subordinate staff this year. Especially there has been display- ed a keenness and enthusiasm by many of the veterinary assistant sur- geons qualified in recent years. 77. I must record my thanks due to Captain W. H. Priston and Khan Sahib S. Niaz Mohammed for the energetic and able way they have carried out their duties in their respective circles. I am also indebted to my Deputy Superintendents, Mr. T. S. Davies, Pandit Tekchand and M. Mohammed Shah, for their help and assistance they have rendered me throughout the year. Also I record with deep regret the death of Pandit Tekchand. 78. As in former years the subordinate staff, both veterinary and clerical, have continued to work satisfactorily during the year. Here I should like to mention the good work carried out by my Head Clerk, Babu Satya Kumar Mukerjee. 79. Also once again I should like to bring to the notice of Govern- ment the name of my Head Assistant, Babu Srish Chandra Bhattacharya, for his valuable help and assistance to me during the year. S. G.

[Maximum limit of report( ii ) LIST OF APPENDICES. PAGES Table no. II.Annual Report on the Civil Veterinary department, United Provinces, 1926-27. 1. The administration report on the department for the year ending March 31, 1927, is herewith submitted. 2. I held charge of the department throughout the year and in addition, I was in charge of the office of the Allahabad circle from December 12, 1926 to January 2, 1927, when the Officiating Superinten- dent, Khan Sahib Shaikh Niaz Mohammad was on leave. 3. Captain W. H. Priston, Superintendent, was in charge of the Agra circle during the year. 4. Khan Sahib Shaikh Niaz Mohammad, officiated as Superinten- dent, Allahabad circle, throughout the year, with the exception of the period between December 12, 1926 and January 2,1927, while he wa3 on leave. 5. Tours of officers :( 2 ) he went to Lahore to examine students of the final year class of the Punjab Veterinary College. 7. Khan Sahib Shaikh Niaz Mohammad was on tour for 115 days and travelled 5,826 miles by rail and 1,451 miles by road. He inspected 33 hospitals and dispensaries of his circle. He checked the work of 10 itinerating veterinary assistant surgeons in six districts and in this connexion some of the inoculations performed by the subordinate staff were verified by him. While travelling in the districts most of the Commissioners of divisions, District Magistrates and the Chairmen of district boards together with other gentlemen likely interested in the activities of the department were interviewed. He inspected the stallion stands at Azamgarh, Gonda and Ramnagar (Bara Banki). He also attended the Dewa fair (Bara Banki) and Jaunpur district exhibition. 8. Mr. T. S. Davies, Deputy Superintendent, Moradabad, took over charge of his duties on February 4, 1927, after the expiry of his leave. He was on tour for 12 days and travelled 68 miles by rail and 28 miles by road. He inspected the veterinary dispensaries at Amroha, Hasanpur and Moradabad and the stallion stand at Joya. 9. M. Gulam Qadir officiated as Deputy Superintendent of the Mora- dabad sub-division while Mr. Davies was on leave. He was on tour for 154 days and travelled 2,730 miles by rail and 1,036 miles by road. He inspected all the veterinary dispensaries and hospitals of his sub- division and all the stallion stands located in the districts of Moradabad, Bijnor, Budaun and Bareilly. He attended the cattle fair at Kakora, district Budaun, and the Agricultural and Industrial exhibition at Moradabad. He attended the surra cases that broke out in the districts of Bareilly, Moradabad and Naini Tal. 10. M. Moin Khan, Officiating Deputy Superintendent, Basti sub- division, travelled 7,299 miles by rail and 1,251 miles by road and was on tour for 169 days during which time he inspected all the hospitals and dispensaries and the stallion stands of his sub-division. He checked and supervised the work of the itinerating veterinary- assistant surgeons and personally attended many outbreaks. He attended a few meetings of the Ballia district board to discuss the question of opening a new dispensary at Belthra road. He attended cattle fairs and shows held in the districts of Ballia and Gorakhpur. He attended the outbreaks of glanders that appeared in the district of Gorakhpur. 11. M. Nazir Husain, Officiating Deputy Superintendent, Jhansi subdivision, travelled 5,035 miles by rail and 677 miles by road and was 189 days on tour. He inspected 18 veterinary hospitals and dis- pensaries of his sub-division and the work of touring men. He inspected the stallion stands located in the districts of Cawnpore and Banda. He personally attended some outbreaks and carried out inoculations. In course of his tour he often demonstrated to the general public the working of the department and its importance for the welfare of live-stock. I.( 3 ) 13. The veterinary assistant surgeon attached to the laboratory of the office of the Veterinary Adviser was again deputed to the Muktesar laboratory to attend a " Refresher Course" for two months. This man after return from there proved himself of great assistance in helping the Veterinary Adviser in research work. 14. It was proposed to depute the men attached to the laboratory of the offices of the circle superintendents to the Muktesar laboratory to undergo a course of bacteriological technique, but the same could not be brought into effect as their services were required in. the province on other more important duties. 15. During his study leave, Mr. Davies attended a post-graduate course of instruction in Veterinary Helminthology, Protozoology and Entomology in the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. 16 Demonstrative lectures were arranged at cattle fairs and shows at which a large number of agriculturists attended and took a keen interest. Instructions with regard to infectious diseases, means of sup- pression, care of animals, etc., were given at many places by the subordinate staff deputed to the different fairs and shows. These efforts of propaganda work were further supplemented by broadcast distribution of pamphlets and hand-bills written in a simple language on the various common diseases of animals in India and other useful veterinary informations, II.( 4 ) 20. Surra.( 5 ) of Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Bulandshahr. Muttra, Banda, Naini Tal, Kheri. and Gonda. In these districts the disease appeared in a very malignant form, the death-rate being specially severe in the young stock. Amongst adults also the disease was of unusual severity, serious mortality occurring in many villages. 26. Haemorrhagic Septicaemia.( 6 ) 33. Two veterinary assistant surgeons in the district of Garhwal having been found much too inadequate, another two men from the headquarters staff have had to be specially deputed to cope with the heavy work. See table IV. 34. During the year under report there were 23 itinerating and 133 veterinary assistant surgeons placed in charge of hospitals and dispensaries who toured in the interior when required to do so. They visited 14,175 villages and treated and castrated 57,946 animals as against 1,00,025. The decrease of 42,079 is mainly attributable to the satisfactory climatic conditions, good health of animals, and a smaller number of foot and mouth disease outbreaks. 35. Investigation of disease.( 7 ) a sum of Rs. 255 was realized from the owners as treatment charges and credited into the treasury. 41. Four contagious stables and wards for small animals have lately been constructed and it is hoped that a good number of animals would come in. Since the construction of these wards, six cases of rabies in dogs were kept under observation and their brains either after destruction or their succumbing to the disease were taken out and sent to the Pathological section of the King George's Medical College, Luckuow, for examination and report, on receipt of which the owners were informed. 42. Two cases of cattle poisoning were reported from the two dis- tricts where the district authorities investigated into them and dealt with the persons concerned. See table V. 43. Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries.( 8 ) 48. The dire necessity of opening at least two veterinary dispen- saries in the district of Garhwal is very keenly felt and as soon as funds would be available steps would be taken in providing the district board with necessary funds for the purpose. III. BREEDING OPERATIONS. (1) BOVINE. Stud bulls. 49. Report under the above head is blank. (2) SHEEP-BREEDING. 50. Report under the above head is blank. (3) POULTRY-BREEDING. 51. The small demonstration poultry run at Badshahbagh Research station is doing good work and research of various diseases in fowls is being carried out in the laboratory. (4) EQUINE. (i) Horse and pony stallions. See table X. 52. At the beginning of the year there were 51 horse and pony stallions at stud belonging to this department. 53. Ten stallions were purchased during the year and one died, thus leaving a balance of 60 at the end of the. year. Sec table XI. 54. Fifty-four were employed at stud work during the year and the number of mares covered by these stallions was 2.120 as against 2,108, being a small increase of 12. The increase would have been larger had not the coverings been stopped during the surra season as a precautionary measure and if some of the stallions had not become unserviceable for stud work due to old age. It is decided to cast them and replace them by new ones. 55. New stands have been opened during the year at the following districts :( 9 ) blood of these animals. Captain Priston, while judging classes of animals at various fairs and shows in the province, made the following remarks about horse-breeding :( 10 ) 65. The veterinary assistant surgeons attached to the headquarters staff have been found to be of great assistance and in many cases they were the only means of relieving the district staff when they proceeded on leave, and thus preventing a locality from being left entirely without veterinary help. The work of the subordinate staff during the year has been very satisfactory with the exception of a few men who had either been warned or otherwise punished. 66. I am glad to bring to the notice of Government that the district board of Fatehpur who reduced their number of veterinary assistant surgeons in 1924, by two out of four have now, after a great endeavour, re-engaged them. It is further pleasing to note that the boards of Saharanpur, Agra, Etah, and Cawnpore have increased the number of veterinary assistant surgeons by one each. 67. I regret to report the death of Babu Hira Chandra, veterinary inspector, who was a hard and conscientious worker. 68. The following veterinary inspectors and assistants are commend- ed for their good work: ( 11 ) 71. Another point I should like to bring to the notice of Government. is the in adequate staff-both superior and subordinate. This is shown every Lime, when epidemic diseases appear in a district in a virulent form and the veterinary assistant surgeon on the spot finds his hands full of outbreak reports and is perplexed to know where to start. We usually have no provincial men who can be posted as a help as most of their time is taken up in leave vacancies when men in districts proceed on leave so that their work may not suffer. 72. In December, 1926, Captain H. Cooper of the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, visited Lucknow and discussed with me the feasibility of carrying out the new treatment for surra as applied to field work and it was arranged that if a natural infected case could be obtained in or near Lucknow, I would have it at once isolated with all proper precautious in my horse isolation wards and that he or somebody else from Muktesar would at once come down and carry out tests and note the results of the new treatment for surra in natural infected cases, as up to date it has been tried with success in only artificial infected cases. I am sorry to say that no case could be found last year but it is hoped during the present year to be able to procure one or more cases. If it be proved a satisfactory treatment for such cases, steps will then be taken to approach Government with a scheme whereby it may be carried out on a large scale in the districts most commonly affected by surra and to see whether or not it is more practicable and satisfactory than our present method of stamping out the disease which is destruction. 73. I regret to bring to the notice of Government the general apathy shown by the district boards to anything pertaining to the Veterinary department but more especially to correspondence dealing with accounts in spite of repeated issue of circulars and reminders on the matter, entailing extra work, loss of time, and unnecessary expenditure. 74. One veterinary inspector and two veterinary assistant surgeons were deputed to the Kumbh Mela at Hardwar to look after the welfare of live stock brought to the mela. This having been proved satisfactory, steps will be taken in future to depute an adequate staff to all large melas which are not connected with cattle shows and fairs. 75. Ten sanads were awarded for rendering genuine assistance and furthering the work of inoculation. 76. My thanks are due to Captain W. H. Priston and Khan Sahib Shaikh Niaz Muhammad for the energetic and painstaking way they have carried out their duties in their circles during the year under report. I am also indebted to my deputy superintendents for the assistance and help they rendered me. 77. The subordinate staff, both veterinary and clerical, have satisfac- torily discharged their duties. Here, again, I should like to mention the name of my head clerk, Babu Satya Kumar Mukerjee, who has carried out his work satisfactorily. Also I wish to bring to the notice of Government the valuable help rendered to me by my head assistant, Babu Srish Chandra Bhattacharjya. S. G. M.

II.Annual Report on the Civil Veterinary department United Provinces, 1927-28. 1. The administration report on the department for the year ending March 31, 1928, is herewith submitted. 2. I held charge of the department during the whole of the year. 3. Captain W. H. Priston, Superintendent, held charge of the Agra circle up to December 1, 1927, when he proceeded on leave out of India for ten months and Mr. T. S. Davies, Deputy Superintendent, Moradabad, took over charge of the office from him. 4. Khan Sahib Shaikh Niaz Mohammad officiated as Superin- tendent, Allahabad circle, throughout the year. 5. Tours of officers.( 2 ) visits. Six important horse shows and cattle fairs were attended by Captain Priston and Mr. Davies, judging at most of them was conducted by the superintendent and the temporary dispensaries set up at the fairs were inspected. Live-stock in many outlying villages were inspected on the spot, investigation into the prevalence of cattle diseases were carried out, and inoculations checked. Several unreported cases were discovered, and immediate action was taken. Steps were also taken to prevail over the orthodox villagers, and counsels were given in favour of scientific methods of inoculation. A deal of the Lower Garhwal was again explored and the results of inoculations in the district were found to be good. Although veterinary improvements in the district are urgently called for, the district board does not appear to be quite alive to the situation, also there is a lack of funds. In June, Captain Priston went to Lahore to examine final year students of the Punjab Veterinary College. 7. Khan Sahib Shaikh Niaz Mohammad travelled 5,617 miles by rail and 2,524 miles by road, and was 129 days on tour. He inspected 40 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries in 15 districts (most of which were twice visited) and checked the work of 7 itinerating veterinary assistant surgeons in 5 districts in connexion with which he per- sonally verified some of the inoculations performed by the sub- ordinate staff. Some outbreaks of cattle diseases were also personally attended by him. In the course of his travels, he interviewed the commissioners of divisions, district magistrates and the chairmen, district boards, and a few other gentlemen interested in the welfare of the department. He also inspected the Municipal Veterinary Hospital, Mirzapur, at the request of the chair- man, municipal board, and issued necessary instructions for their guid- ance. He attended the Dewa Pair (Bara Banki) and the Dadri Fair (Ballia) and acted as a member of the judging committee where demon- strations and lectures on various useful veterinary subjects by the sub- ordinate veterinary staff were supervised. He attended the first meeting of the executive body of the Dadri Pair and District Agricultural Asso- ciation, Ballia, organized under the presidentship of the district magis- trate. He inspected stallion stands in the districts of Allahabad, Gorakhpur, Azamgarh, Gonda and Bara Banki. He also interviewed the Special Manager of the Balrampur Estate during the year, and discussed with him on veterinary matters concerning his estate. 8. Mr. T. S. Davies, Deputy Superintendent, Moradabad, held charge of the sub-division up to the end of November, 1927, prior to his transfer to Agra, and toured for 56 days, travelling 1,116 miles by rail and 306 miles by road. He inspected 11 dispensaries and 4 stalltion stands. 9. M. Ghulam Qadir officiated as Deputy Superintendent, Morad- abad, from December 1, 1927, to the end of the year. His tour ranged
( 3 ) for 65 days, during which he travelled 1,972 miles by rail and 464 miles by road. He inspected 21 veterinary dispensaries and 7 stallion stands in his sub-division. He attended the horse and cattle fairs at Deorania, district Bareilly, and the Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition at Moradabad. He checked the inoculations performed by the subordinate veterinary staff and personally attended seats of outbreaks, wherever necessary. 10. M. Moin Khan, Officiating Deputy Superintendent, held charge of the Basti sub-division from April 1 to October 15, 1927, sub- sequent to which date he was transferred to the Jhansi sub-division, which he held under his charge to the end of the year. During the year he toured for 153 days and travelled 5,553 miles by rail, and 656 miles by road. While in Basti, he inspected 13 veterinary dispensaries, 3 stallion stands and checked the work of 7 itinerating veterinary assistant surgeons. In the district of Bahraich he dealt with the outbreak of rinderpest, and a number of inoculations were performed under his supervision. He attended the Debi Patan Fair in the Gonda district and made necessary arrangements. In the Jhansi sub-division he in- spected 15 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries, 4 stallion stands, and scrutinized the work of 2 itinerating veterinary assistant surgeons. He attended a meeting of the district board, Jhansi, in the interest of the department. In both the circles of Basti and Jhansi he called upon the district officers to have their sympathy and co-operation in the smooth working of the department. He also interviewed the chairmen, district boards, in the interest of veterinary work in general. While on tour he endeavoured to impress upon the general public the advantages of this department, and explained to them by demonstrations and lectures that the proper care of cattle lives was so important as those of human beings, and that the prosperity of the country depended on the welfare of the cattle-wealth for which the services of the Veterinary department should best be utilized in the right direction. He also drew special attention to the horse-breeding scheme. 11. M. Nazir Husain, Officiating Deputy Superintendent, held charge of the Jhansi sub-division from April 1 to October 25, 1927, when he was transferred to Basti sub-division. He toured for 214 days in the year, travelling 6,445 miles by rail and 898 miles by road. While in Jhansi he inspected 19 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries, and the work of one itinerating veterinary assistant surgeon and 3 stallion stands. His proposal for the building of stallion stands at Jhansi and Mauranipur has been accepted, and the stands have been built. He also caused a Government stallion to be sent to Bath, district Hamirpur. He attended outbreaks of cattle diseases in the district of Cawnpore where it was violent in June and July, 1927, and got about 5,000 cattle inoculated under his supervision and checked inoculation work at different places. On his proposal, Banda district board built a stallion stand at Banda. A vernacular pamphlet about cattle
( 4 ) epidemics was compiled by him with the approvals of the District Magistrate and Chairman, District Board, Cawnpore, and the Super- intendent, Civil Veterinary department, Agra, which were distributed among villagers and patwaris for guidance. In the Basti sub-division he inspected 14 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries and checked the work of 3 itinerating veterinary assistant surgeons. He inspected the stallion stands of Gorakhpur, Gonda and Azamgarh. He also visited the bull stand at Gonda, and also 2 cattle pounds in the Gorakhpur district. He attended the Dadri Pair in Ballia district, and the horse and cattle exhibition at Gorakhpur. At both the places he worked as a member of the judging committee and supervised the veterinary staff under his control. While on tour he tried to induce the people to take up horse-breeding. I.(5) attended by the agriculturist community who took a keen interest in them, and it was strengthened by the free distribution of pamphlets in simple vernacular dealing with the causes and means of suppression of cattle diseases containing valuable information. II.(6) 24. Other contagious diseases.(7) disease suddenly appears and generally runs a rapid fatal course, giving little time for proper diagnosis. 30. Other contagious diseases.(8) 36. Investigation of disease.(9) 38. A limited number of fowls suffering from fowl cholera were experimented upon with different antiseptic drugs, but no satisfactory results were obtained. Fowl cholera serum received from abroad was tried with success, but it is too expensive to be used generally. An outbreak of "Spirochætosis" was dealt with by intramuscular injection of "Soamin" at different stages of the disease, and 50 per cent. of the vases treated at the proper stage got cured by a single injection and the rest either required a repetition or had no effect by it. Fifty birds affected with "Scabies Deplumance" were treated by a dip composed of various drugs, but sulphurated potash was found most effective and in a course of 3 weeks they were freed from the disease. Experiments on Piroplasmosis were carried on in the circle labora- tory at Agra, and "Chemo-therapeutic" treatment was tried as curative which yielded satisfactory results. 39. Good work has been done at the Research and Experimental station where 214 cases of obscure diseases were satisfactorily treated and Rs. 295-5-0 was realized from the owners as treatment charges. The institution is gradually earning a good name for itself. 40. The new isolation wards have begun to attract cases, and 28 cases found admission. Eight cases of rabies were kept under observ- ation and their brains taken out and sent to the Pasteur Institute, Kasauli, or the Pathological Section, King George's Medical College, Lucknow, for examination and report. The persons bitten were advised to undergo anti-rabic treatment at Kasauli. Twenty cases of such con- tagious diseases as are not allowable in general hospitals were kept as indoor patients and treated with successful results. It is expected that in the near future when water-pipe, electric connexion and servants quarters are arranged for in the new institution, it will earn extensive popularity. 41. Experiments on treatment of kumri on horse with Bayer 205 (Naganol) have been undertaken. 42. Cattle-poisoning.(10) making a total of 252,609 as against a total of 215,257, showing an increase of 37,352 over the last year's figures. Medicines were also given to 33,881 cases not brought to hospitals, and 2,935 animals were castrated as against 26,900 and 2,905 respectively of the previous year. 45. A sum of Rs. 30,000 was provided in the budget of this year for contribution to district boards for construction of veterinary dis- pensary buildings, of which Rs. 20,008 were actually contributed to the district boards of Lucknow, Moradabad, Budaun, Farrukhabad, Fyz- abad, Ghazipur, Mirzapur, Pilibhit, Ballia and Gorakhpur as a Gov- ernment moiety for construction of new buildings or improvements in the existing buildings as necessity demanded. 46. It is regretted that the district board of Benares finally decided to close the sadr veterinary dispensary and transferred it to the munici- pal board. This means that it is taken out of the hands of the Civil Veterinary Department for inspection and other purposes. 47. The necessity for veterinary hospitals in the district of Garh- wal is becoming more and more acute, and the earliest opportunity will be seized for such an institution for which arrangements are in progress. III.(11) 54. Six new stallion stands have been opened in the following 4 districts :(12) pamphlets on various common ailments of domesticated animals were arranged by the department. IV.(13) or no further progress can be expected. With our present inadequate staff, it is impossible to quickly suppress contagious diseases or keep them controlled within certain areas; also Government granting insuffi- cient funds for sera, we are confronted with a period each year when our grant runs out and have to approach Government for additional funds. During this period no inoculation can be carried out for want of sera and in outbreaks visited by the veterinary assistant surgeons nothing can be done excepting explaining to villagers the benefit of isolation which, in the great majority of cases, is not carried out by them with the result that the disease spreads. Another factor for the spread- ing of diseases is the journeying through these provinces of cattle dealers from the Punjab. I do not say that they are totally responsible for bringing the disease, but by journeying from village to village they spread it. During last June I made a circular tour through the dis- tricts of Cawnpore, Etah, Aligarh, Bulandshahr, Meerut and Saharan- pur and it was easily seen that the route taken by the cattle dealers from the Punjab was marked by outbreaks of contagious diseases. Nothing can prevent this except legislation and co-operation of province with province. I agree that it might not be possible to put it into force for some years, but having once passed a set of rules on the lines of the Contagious Diseases Animals Act of England, it would always be at hand to enforce. 66. The District Remount Officer, Babugarh, in his annual report of the working of the provincial stallions in the selected districts has remarked that, in his opinion, our present method of destruction against the stamping of surra cannot possibly effect any check, as it only touches the fringe, and that Government should start a treatment centre either free or on payment of fees where animals affected should be treated by the latest methods. I quite agree with his remarks that we at the present time touch only the fringe of the disease, but I should like to point out, as quoted above, that due to want of funds and inade- quate staff we only touch the fringe of any of the contagious diseases which occur amongst the domesticated animals. One centre would be of little use, it would mean a centre in each of the yearly infected dis- tricts and a large staff of highly trained technical men. Also treat- ment would, in the cases of country tats, cost more than the value of the animal, and nothing definite has as yet been proved that it is an actual cure in the field. But I am given to understand that in Java it has been used as a prophylactic in army animals. 67. I regret to again have to bring to the notice of Government the general apathy shown by the district boards in answering corres- pondence, etc., with this department. This has been brought to my notice by both my circle officers and I have personally experienced it
(14) also and more especially to circular instructions issued from time to time with regard to statements of accounts, etc., which involves loss of time, unnecessary correspondence and extra heavy office work. 68. The Mobile Squad sanctioned by Government in last year's budget could not be got together clue to no veterinary assistant surgeons being available to fill the posts because other provinces were also in- creasing their veterinary staff and offering better rates of pay, etc. We have to recuit our men for the most part from the Punjab. This is also done by the Central Provinces. All men not taken by the Punjab Government after qualifying go to the Central Provinces, and we are left with what is not wanted by them. 69. Two students were sent to England during the last financial year on a four-year course to qualify for their M.R.C.V.S., and we are sending again one this year. It is hoped that when qualified, they will be added to the cadre of this department. 70. One horse suffering from kumri was treated by the Bayer (205) method with very favourable results, and further investigation will be made as cases from time to time come to the notice of the department, 71. With profound regret I have to record the sudden death on April 17, 1928, of my head assistant Babu Srish Chandra Bhattacharjya. I have lost a valuable helper, and the department, a willing worker. 72. Thirteen sanads were awarded during the year for rendering genuine assistance in furthering the work of inoculation. 73. My thanks are due to Captain W. H. Priston, Khan Sahib Shaikh Niaz Mohammad and Mr. T. S. Davies for the energetic way they have carried out their duties in their respective circles during the year, also 1 am indebted to my deputy superintendents for the help they have rendered me. 74. On the whole, the subordinate staff, both veterinary and cleri- cal, have worked satisfactorily. I should also like to bring to the notice of Government the name of my head clerk, now my head assistant, Babu Satya Kumar Mukerjee for the way he has performed the duties entrusted to him. S. G. M.

IN submitting the report for the year ending March 31, 1929, on the work done in the United Provinces by the Civil Veterinary department, atttention is drawn to the amount of work performed by the department with the small personnel at its disposal, The following report deals with the work in detail under various heads. Examination has been made of the recommendations put forward by the Royal Commission on Agriculture. Most of these are agreed with in the department and should be brought into effect as soon as financial and other circumstances permit. It is not expected that they can be carried out in the very near future, but there is no reason why they should not be given effect to in the course of time. There are many difficulties to be overcome in order to bring the departmental cadre up to anything like the strength recommended. The main obstacles appear to beReport on the Civil Veterinary department, United Provinces, for the year 1928-29, by Captain W. H. Priston, F. R. C. V. S., I. V. S., Officiating Director. CHAPTER I. Administration. 1. The Veterinary Adviser to Government, United Provinces, and the Superintendents and Deputy Superintendents toured in their respec- tive circles, inspecting veterinary institutions and stallion stands. They also carried out investigations of contagious diseases where necessary.

There were 21 cases of cattle poisoning reported during the year. Cattle poisoning. CHAPTER IV. VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES.

( 7 ) 23. It has been decibed to take up anti-rabic treatment of animals in cases where the owners are prepared to meet the necessary charges. Tin laboratory at Lucknow has been equipped with a Violet Ray apparatus with which experiments in the treatment of special cases were carried out with favourable results. Treatment at head- quarters. 24. Two hundred and fifty cases were treated at headquarters with satisfactory results and a sum of Rs. 541-12-0 was realized as fees, CHAPTER VI, BREEDING. Breeding.( 8 ) CHAPTER VIII. PROPAGANDA. Propaganda. 28. Satisfactory progress was made. During the year under report lectures were delivered by the subordinate staff at all the important fairs and shows in the province. At the same time hand-bills and pamphlets dealing with contagious diseases of animals were distributed. Lectures were also given in schools and in villages by members of the department during their tours, The Directors of Public Instruction and Land Records asked for lectures to be given to the students of their Vernacular Middle and Patwari schools. This request was acceded to as far as possible. In some cases arrange- ments were made for lectures to patwaris when they visited headquarters to receive their pay. By this means the patwaris are being educated to report cattle diseases when they occur immediately and correctly. There is room for much improvement throughout the province in reporting cattle epidemics and if patwaris would only take the trouble to report outbreaks immediately a large number of cattle could be saved, thereby reducing the loss to the cultivators which otherwise might be severe. 29. Exhibits are sent to all the important fairs and shows throughout the province showing the veterinary instruments most commonly used, and also diagrams, charts and interesting zoological specimens. Arrangements are made for these to be displayed at a stall in the charge of a member of the department who lectures at frequent intervals and answers any ques- tions asked. This form of propaganda appears to be doing much to educate the poorer classes in the importance of veterinary aid. It is satisfactory to note the interest taken by the villagers. Although progress has been made in this way during the year there is very great scope for further advance on the lines of practical addresses and demonstrations. These could be carried out with advantage by the aid of magic lantern slides or cinematograph films. CHAPTER IX. ESTABLISHMENT. Establishment. 30. The strength of the subordinate establishment as it stood at the end of the year under report was as follows:( 9 ) Stipendiary students. 32. Three stipendiary students were again sent to the Bengal Veter- inary College, Calcutta. Out of the three sent in the previous year only two have been successful in passing the first annual examination. It is considered necessary that the number of students sent for training should be increased with as much rapidity as possible year by year, in order to bring the cadre up bo strength. According bo the recommenda- tions on this subject put forward by the Royal Commission on Agriculture in India the cadre of veterinary assistant surgeons in these provinces should be 1,242. This would mean a very large increase in the present cadre of 209. CHAPTER X. EXPENDITURE. Expenditure.( 10 ) 39. On the recommendation of departmental officers and others in authority eight Sanads were presented to certain Mukhias and Zamindars of villages in the districts of Cawnpore, Aligarh, Mainpuri, Benares, Allahabad and Ballia, who had rendered special help to the department during the year. Some of the names are given below:( 11 ) TABLE II. Showing number of deaths from contagious diseases amongst animals during the year 1928-2,9. District. Equines. Bovines. Others. Glanders. Anthrax.

( iii ) PARAGRAPHS LIST OF APPENDICES. PAGES. Table no. II.Annual Report on the Civil Veterinary department, United Provinces, for the year 1929-30. CHAPTER I. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. 1. Captain W. H. Priston acted in my place as Director, Civil Veterinary department, United Provinces, from the beginning of the year till August 10, 1929, when he reverted to his substantive appoint- ment as Superintendent, Agra Circle, consequent on my return from leave out of India. 2. I held charge of the department from August 10, 1929, to the end of tile year. 3. Mr. T. S. Davies, Deputy Superintendent, held charge of the Agra Circle from the beginning of the year up to August 21, 1929, when Captain Priston took over charge of the circle from him. Mr. Davies again took over charge of the Agra Circle on March 13, 1930, when Captain Priston proceeded to the Central Provinces to officiate as Director of Veterinary Services of that province. 4. Khan Bahadur Sheikh Niaz Mohammad officiated as Superin- tendent, Allahabad Circle, throughout the year. 5. During the period that Captain W. H. Priston officiated as Director, Civil Veterinary department, United Provinces, he was on tour for 75 days and travelled 3,752 miles by rail and 988 miles by road. He visited 9 districts and made several inspections of the stallion dépôt at Moradabad. He inspected 10 veterinary hospitals and dis- pensaries and the stallion stand at Joya, district Moradabad. He attended the Nauchandi fair at Meerut, visited the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute at Muktesar, district Naini Tal, attended the first meeting of Agricultural Research Council at Simla and was a member of the examining board of the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore. After my return from leave L toured for 42 days and travelled 1,696 miles by rail and 373 by road, 1 visited 8 districts, some of which were visited more than once. I inspected 11 veterinary hospitals and dis- pensaries and also the itinerary work of veterinary assistant surgeons during the course of my tours. The stallion stands in the districts of Bara Banki and Hardoi were inspeced. The stallion depot at Moradabad was frequently inspected for allocation of stallions to different district stands and on other administrative grounds. I attended the district exhibition at Moradabad and acted as the President of the judging committee at the Horse and Cattle fair held in connection
(2) therewith. I also attended a Cattle fair at Dahla in the district of Bara Banki which, although started only recently, but is growing in popularity. I attended the All-India Poultry Exhibition held at Luck- now and took an active part in its organization with the valuable assis- tance of the Secretary, United Provinces Poultry Association. I appeared before the Hide Cess Enquiry Committee at Cawnpore and submitted suggestions for the protection of hides at economical points of trade in that line. G. Mr. T. S. Davies held charge of the Agra Circle until August 21, 1929, when he handed over charge to Captain W. H. Priston on his return to his substantive appointment as Superintendent after offi- ciating as the Director. On March P2, 1930 (A. N.), Mr. Davies again took over charge from Captain Priston when he proceeded to the Central Provinces to act as the Director of Veterinary Services of that province. During the time that Mr. Davies held charge of the Agra Circle he toured for 71 days, travelling 1,309 miles by rail and 1,582 miles by road. Captain Priston was 75 days on tour and he travelled 945 miles by rail and 2,254 miles by road. During the year 40 veterinary hos- pitals and dispensaries and 16 stallion stands were inspected as also the work of one itinerating veterinary assistant surgeon in the circle. Some of the institutions were inspected more than once. Five Horse shows and Cattle fairs were attended to where animals were judged and prizes awarded. 7. Khan Bahadur Sheikh Niaz Mohammad toured for 128 days and travelled 3,023 miles by road and 3,620 miles by rail. He visited 15 districts of his circle and inspected 42 hospitals and dispensaries and also checked the work of four itinerating veterinary assistant surgeons attached to the districts of Mirzapur, Gorakhpur, Gonda and Bahraich. He inspected 7 stallion stands and attended 3 Cattle fairs and shows. He personally attended some scats of outbreaks of cattle diseases in the districts of Gonda, Jaunpur and Azamgarh and persuaded the owners of cattle for getting their animals protected by inoculation. In certain districts he supervised the treatment of rinderpest by iodine solution injection method introduced during the year as an experimental measure and examined the results. In this connection he also verified some of the inoculations performed by the subordinate staff. During his tours he interviewed most of the Commissioners and District Officers and also the Chairmen and some members of District Boards with whom he discussed matters relating to the growing need of veterinary aid in their districts, and also laid stress on the necessity of providing suitable veterinary hospital buildings on the half-and-half basis. Government contributing half the cost and the Board meeting the other half, but stringency of District Board funds was the common excuse. He paid several visits to the Allahabad Agricultural Institute at Naini to carry out investigations and tests among the herds for tuberculosis and Johne's disease and gave necessary instructions to the Farm authorities.
(3) 8. M. Ghulam Qadir (now Khan Sahib) officiated as Deputy Superintendent, Moradabad sub-division, from the beginning of the year to August 28, 1929, when Mr. Davies returned from the Agra Circle. He again took over charge of the sub-division on March 8, 1930, when Mr. Davies was relieved for duties in the Agra Circle consequent on Captain Priston proceeding on temporary transfer to the Central Prov- inces. 9. During the period that he officiated as Deputy Superintendent, Moradabad, Khan Sahib Ghulam Qadir inspected 13 veterinary dis- pensaries and 3 stallion stands, some of which were visited twice. He was on tour for 66 days and travelled 459 miles by road and 2,438 miles by rail. He travelled into the interior of the Almora district to make investigations into the contagious diseases of cattle and also to make the people acquainted with the benefits of veterinary science. 10. Mr. Davies toured for 23 days, travelling 570 miles by road and 307 miles by rail. He inspected 9 veterinary hospitals and dis- pensaries and 3 stallion stands in the Moradabad sub-division. He also attended the Horse and Cattle show at Moradabad in company with the Director, Civil Veterinary department, United Provinces. 11. M. Moin Khan, Deputy Superintendent, held charge of the Jhansi sub-division throughout the year, except for two months, from October 7, 1929, that he went on leave, when Khan Sahib Ghulam Qadir officiated for him. They remained on tour for 129 days, having travelled 412 miles by road and 5,402 miles by rail. Twenty-one veteri- nary hospitals and dispensaries and 4 stallion stands were inspected. M. Moin Khan attended the Makanpur Cattle fair in the Cawnpore district, where he was a member of the judging committee. He also attended the District Board meetings at Fatehpur and Jhansi and also inspected several cattle pounds in the course of his tours. He also interviewed sonic of the District Magistrates and Chairmen, District Boards, of his sub-division in connection with the activities of this department. 12. M. Nazir Husain, Officiating Deputy Superintendent, Basti, held charge of the sub-division up to March 4, 1930, on the afternoon of which date he proceeded on leave. During this period he spent 151 days on tour, travelling 2,436 miles by rail and 1,162 miles by road. He inspected 10 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries and checked the work of the itinerating veterinary assistant surgeon at Balrampur, dis- trict Gonda.

March 4, 1930, and toured for 17 days dining the remaining part of the year. He travelled 1.01.3 miles by rail and 151 miles by road, visiting 9 veterinary dispensaries and one stallion stand.
(4) CHAPTER II. TREATMENT OF DISEASES. Contagious diseases. Mortality. Table II. 14. During the year under report cattle epidemics were of a virulent type in a number of districts in the prov- ince, the total death roll being 48,331 agoinst 26,093 in the previous year. (a) Equine. Table II. 15. The total number of deaths under the head was 61 compared with 90 in the previous year. Glanders and Farcy. 16. It is pleasing to note that no case of glanders was reported during the year. Anthrax. 17. No case of this disease was reported. Surra. 18. Three cases of this disease were microscopically confirmed and dealt with accordingly. They appeared in the districts of Bijnor, Hamirpur and Ballia. Last year there were 19 cases, affecting five districts. Compensation has been paid in accordance with rules under the Glanders and Farcy Act. Dourine. 19. No dourine case was discovered during the year. Other contagious disca- ses. 20. Fifty-eight cases of deaths were reported under this head as compared with G8 last year. These include such disases as strangles, tenanus, pitoplasmosis, rabies, Miliary fever, etc. (b) Bovine. Rinderpest. Table II. 21. This disease assumed a virulent form and was widespread throughout the province, the total deaths reported being 35,845 against 13,479 in the previous year. It rose to over a thousand in 16 districts, over a hundred in 25, and below that figure in 7 districts. The highest number of deaths occurred in Moradabad district, where it numbered 2,940 and the lowest figured only two in Benares. Endeavours arc made to explain to the villagers the importance of simple measures by the timely adoption of which the spread of an epidemic can be averted to a great extent, but a thorough propaganda work in this direction can hardly be formulated for want of proper staff and materials. Much is needed in this direction, hut the question of funds forms a stumbling block. Anti-rinderpest inocula- tions. Table III. 22. During the year under review there were 157,677 inoculations compared with 88,166 in the previous year. The reason for this is that there were larger outbreaks and the stock owners have gradually begun to favour inoculations much more than they did in the past. The number
(5) could have been higher still if lesser time was occupied for serum to be received from the Imperial Laboratory at Muktesar. Iodine solution injec- tion. A special treatment of rinderpest by the iodine injection method has been experimented upon, and out of 301 cases treated, 221 have been reported to have recovered. Treatment on this line will be extended, and if similar results are obtained it will be a boon to the cattle-owning popula- tion as animals already suffering from rinderpest can be treated by this method. Foot and mouth disease. Table II. 23. The number of cases that are reported to have died from this disease was 2,248 compared with 2,064 in the preceding year. The disease is reported in all the districts of the province, with the exception of Lucknow, Jalaun and Unao. As far as possible curative treatment and hygienic measures were adopted or advised. Haernorrhagic septicae- mia. Table II. 24. Seven thousand eight hundred and eighty-four cases of deaths under this head were reported against 7,280 last year. The disease spread all over the province excepting the districts of Dehra Dun and Naini Tal. It assumed a severe form in the districts of Cawnpore, Jalaun and Benares, where the loss was heavy. Inoculations. Table III. Fifty-five thousand six hundred and thirty-five inoculations were carried out during the year compared with 51,756 in the year preceding. Blackquarter. Tables II and III. 25. This disease appeared in 28 districts compared with 31 last year. The number of deaths reported was only 529 against 1,304 in the year before. Five thousand seven hundred and eight inoculations were carried out by the serum alone or serum aggressin methods with highly satisfactory results. Anthrax. Tables II and III. 26. This disease was reported in 19 districts only compared with 30 in the preceding year. The deaths reported were 288 against 924 in the year before. There were 1,766 inoculations against this disease. Other contagious disca- ses. Table II. 27. One hundred and seventy-eight were recorded under this head against 362 deaths in the previous year. These comprise pleuro-pneumonia, liver fluke, cow-pox, red water, etc., etc. (c) Other animals. Table II. 28. One thousand two hundred and ninety-eight cases of deaths were reported amongst animals other than the equines and bovines. They include cases of dis- temper, rabies, piroplasmosis, fowl cholera and other parasitic diseases.
(6) CHAPTER III. NON-CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. Non-contagious disea- ses. Table V. 29. Under this beading 255, 728 case were treated in veterinary hospitals and dispensories compared with 239,515 in the year preceding; in addition to these the number of cases supplied with medicines but not brought to hospitals was 40,112 against 30,488 last year. Both these figures indicate a fair increase of work done. Tables TV and V. 30. One lakh eight hundred and eighty-three cases were treated by veterinary assistant surgeons while on tour in the villages, affording a great relief to the rural popula- tion. In the previous year the cases numbered 60,971 only. The addition of 39,912 cases treated during the year under report works to an increase of 66 per cent. over the last year's figures. This goes to show the strenuous efforts the staff had to make to cope with the heavy increase of work which reflects no small credit to them. The number of castrations carried out during the year was 3,247. Special attention is being paid towards castration of scrub bulls, and a consider- able increase towards this branch of work is expected in the year follow- ing. 31. There were 23 cases of cattle-poisoning as reported during the year from the districts of Meerut, Aligarh, Bareilly, Shahjahanpur, Pilibhit, Cawnpore and Ghazipur and the accused persons were dealt with accordingly. CHAPTER IV. VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. Table V. 32. There were 160 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries at the beginning of the year, which has increased to 165 at the end of the year. Seven new institutions have been opened in the Cawnpore, Banda, Bahraich, Gorakhpur and Muttra districts, viz., one in Cawnpore district, two in Banda district, one in Bahraich district, one in Muttra district, and two in Gorakhpur district, and the one started at Nanpara in Bahraich district on February 6, 1929, and one at Bahua in Fatehpur district have been closed during the year in view of the limited finances of the boards. The question of re-establishing the Radar veterinary hospital at Mirzapur has been decided, and it will be a great satisfaction if the institution is started again after having been closed down since 1923. A veterinary hospital has been erected at Pauri in Garhwal district. and it is expected that it will prove to be of immense benefit to the district where most of its transport is carried on by means of animals. More such institutions are still needed in that district as the one now provided is not sufficient to meet the demand for the whole of the district whose area covers 5,761 square miles. 33. A map showing the location of veterinary institutions in the province will be found at the end of the report.

(7) Grants-in-aid for construction of veterinary hospitals. 34. This year again there was a heavy lapse of provision under this head as district boards were unable to come forward to avail themselves of the opportunity offered by the Government on the ground that they had not the resources to meet half the cost of construction of veterinary institutions, the other half being contributed by Government. It is hoped that in the future the boards will find it advantageous to build standard type veterinary hospitals in their districts in place of the unsuitable premises that the public institutions are now located in. CHAPTER V. LABORATORIES. Laboratory work. 35. Three hundred and eighty-four smears were examined at the headquarters and circle laboratories this year. Besides these a good number of pathological specimens and parasites were also dealt with. A detailed statement showing the names of the diseases of which the smears were tested with their results is given below:(8) Anti-rabic treatment. 36. Anti-rabic treatment has been taken up at the Isolation Ward attached to the headquarters laboratory and a limited number of animals were kept as indoor patients and treated with anti-rabic vaccine; none of them has so far developed the disease, though they were bitten very near the head by known rabid animals. Liver flakes. 37. In an outbreak of liver flukes in district Meerut, Carbon tetra chloride was used as an experimental measure and gave satisfactory results. It will be continued when opportunity offers again in the future. Canine piroplasmosis, etc. 38. Experimental work on canine piroplasmosis, bursati and nasal granuloma was continued during the year. Treatment at Research Station, Lucknow. 39. Three hundred and eighty-nine cases were satisfactorily treated at the headquarters as compared with 215 treated last year. A sum of Rs. 756 was realized as fees as against Rs. 542 in the preceding year. CHAPTER VI. BREEDING OPERATIONS. (i) Horse and pony stallions. Table X. 40. There were 67 horse and pony stallions belonging to the depart- ment at the commencement of the year for administration of horse-breeding in the "non- selected" portion of the province. Four stallions were purchased during the year, two died and eight destroyed being old or otherwise unfit for stud work, leaving a balance of 61 stallions at the end of the year. Table XI. 41. Fifty stallions were employed at stud during the year and the number of coverings amounted to 2,193 compared with 2.342 during the preceding year, but the average worked to 43'9 against 42'5 in the previous year. 42. A new stallion stand has been opened at Majhauli, district Gorakhpur, and is gaining popularity. The opening of a stand at Mirzapur is under contemplation and is expected to be started as soon as the stabling accommodation is ready. The stallion stand at Deara, dis- trict Sultanpur, had to be closed in January 1930 owing to very limited demand for service of the stallion. The stallion stand at Rampur- Maniharan in district Saharanpur was closed in August 1930 and in place thereof a new one has been opened at Ghanakhandi in the same district. A proposal for the opening of a new stallion stand at Sarai Dadomir in the Bijnor district was received from M. Amin Chand, zamindar, who agreed to take the loan of a Government stallion and bear all maintenance himself. The proposal has been welcomed and will be brought into effect in the succeeding year. The Gunaur stallion stand in Budaun district had to be temporarily removed from the hands of

(9) Ch. Shabir Husain for mismanagement and placed in charge of Ch. Abdul Rashid, but the stallions have had to be sent to the stallion dépôt at Moradabad until the new darindah is in a position to arrange for suit- able stables for the animals. The question of reopening of a stallion stand at Sitapur has been put off for the present for want of funds. 43. The progeny of Government stallions are showing a continual improvement in their blood. 44. The location of stud animals is shown on the map at the end of the report. Stallion dépôt. 45. As already reported last year, an extension of the Moradabad depot premises is badly needed and funds are required to be provided for extra stables for proper accommodation of the stallions as the existing number of stables does not suffice to meet all requirements. (ii) Donkey stallions. 46. At the commencement of the year there were 14 jack donkeys; one was destroyed being useless for stud purposes, leaving a balance of 13 at the end of the year. 47. Ten of the jacks were actually at stud work, and the coverings performed by them were 243. This worked to an average of 24.3 only compared with 36'6 of the preceding year. The decrease in this num- ber is apparently due to people not taking interest in mule breeding in the provinces. CHAPTER VII. FATES AND SHOWS. Fairs and shows. Table XIV. 48. There was a number of Cattle and Horse fairs and shows in the province in which the department participated by granting prizes to the best kept animals, displaying interesting veterinary exhibits wherever possible, and also by distribution of pamphlets dealing with common contagious diseases of animals. In the judging of animals the department played an important part. I was the President of the judging committee at the Moradabad exhibition, Captain Priston conducted judging at the large fair at Batesar, district Agra, and Khan Bahadur Sheikh Niaz Mohammad acted as a member of the judging committee at the Dewa fair, district Barn Banki. The Deputy Superintendents, veterinary inspectors and veterinary assistant surgeons also did their share in their respective jurisdictions in the matter of judging animals and making adequate veterinary arrangements in the different fairs and shows for the treatment of sick animals. The Batesar fair, which is the largest of its kind in Northern India and which was suspended last year for shortage of fodder, was a great success this year. It was attended by Captain Cooper. Research Officer of the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar, and he rendered all possible help in judging animals for prizes. A veterinary 2
(10) hospital and a camp laboratory were also opened on the fair grounds which did good work, and Captain Cooper was greatly impressed with the excellent arrangements. In the Dewa fair great inconvenience was experienced owing to the district board persistently declining to depute even a single veterinary assistant surgeon to the exhibition. The ques- tion has, however, since been solved by the Commissioner of the divi- sion, and it is hoped that this difficulty will not arise in the future. 49. A cattle exhibition was newly organized by the Allahabad Agricultural Association at Kumbh Mela this year and Khan Bahadur Sheikh Niaz Mohammad gave necessary advice to the authorities for its proper organization. Steps were taken to depute a veterinary inspector and a veterinary assistant surgeon to prevent an outbreak of cattle disease among the large number of animals brought in by the vast multi- tude of people who attended the fair. It is pleasing to note that through the care and strict vigilance exercised there was no case of contagions disease amongst animals brought to the fair. CHAPTER VIII. PROPAGANDA. Propaganda. 50. Proper method of propaganda is essential, but at the present time it cannot be adopted for want of suitable materials, necessary staff and adequate funds. All that could be done with the small resources in hand was done by display of veterinary exhibits in the fairs and shows, and distribution of pamphlets on common contagious diseases in English, Urdu and Hindi. Lectures were also given by the members of the department on suppression of cattle diseases in general at the different fairs and shows which were appreciated and proved successful. 51. The patwaris were lectured on their pay days at certain centres on the common prominent symptoms of the different contagious diseases of cattle, and by this method there seems to have been some improvement in the reporting of cattle diseases, and it has also acted as a general propaganda as the lectures are usually attended by the culti- vators and persons generally interested in cattle. CHAPTER IX. ESTABLISHMENT. Establishment. Table VII. 52. The strength of the subordinate establishment at the end of the year stood as follows:(11) Retirement. 53. During the course of the year there were two cases of retire- ment from service on superannuation pension from the staff of the veterinary assistant surgeons. Foreign scholarships. 54. Two State scholarships tenable for four years were awarded for the third year in succession to two Indian Graduates for obtaining Veterinary Degrees in the United Kingdom. With these two young men there are at present six veterinary scholars under training abroad. Indian scholarships. 55. Ten stipendiary students were selected for training at the Bengal Veterinary College, Calcutta, but only nine of them actually joined the college, as one backed out after being selected. Five students who were already in the college have been successful in their respective examinations. Tours of veterinary inspectors. 56. The veterinary inspectors toured on an average of 203'3 days per man, travelling at an aggregate of 33,536 miles by rail and 18,779 by road. They visited 2,700 villages in the course of their duties in the year. Lectures on cattle disea- ses to different schools. 57. At the request of the Director of Public Instruction and the Director of Land Records, United Provinces, the small personnel of veterinary inspectors and veterinary assistant surgeons delivered 401 instruc- tive lectures to the students of the different schools as enumerated below. The lectures dealt with mostly on the common contagious diseases of animals, their treatment by hygienic measures and administration of ordinary country medicines in ordinary simple cases of non-contagious diseases and the general management of cattle and their upkeep:(12) CHAPTER X. EXPENDITURE. Expenditure. Table XIV A. 58. The cost of the department during the year was Rs. 5,39,025 as against Rs. 4,55,282 in the year preceding. Receipts were Rs. 1,36,195 and the net cost came to Rs. 4,02,830. CHAPTER XI. GENERAL REMARKS. 59. My thanks are due to Captain W. H. Priston and Khan Bahadur Sheikh Niaz Mohammad for the able way and the great interest they took in performing their duties in their respective circles and the great help they afforded me; also to Mr. T. S. Davies while acting as Officiating Superintendent of the Agra Circle. Also I am indebted to my Deputy Superintendents for the help they have rendered me during the year. 60. The work of both the clerical and technical staff has been most satisfactory, especially that at headquarters, and I should like to bring to the notice of Government the name of my Head Assistant Babu Satya Kumar Mukerjee for the way he has performed the duties entrust- ed to him. A mention may be made of M. Mohammad Ishaq Khan for the good work done by him as veterinary inspector, Fyzabad Circle, and also of Babu Ram Swarup Lal, veterinary assistant surgeon, Gorakhpur, for discharging his duties with zeal. 61. On the recommendation of departmental officers and district authorities 21 sanads were issued to zamindars and others of villages in the districts of Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Farrukhabad, Etawah, Fatehpur and Jhansi. Some of the names are given below:(13) may occur in the hill tracts of this province. But we hope in the near future to be able to complete the squad. 63. It is gratifying when comparing the general work done during the year under review with that of the previous year that it shows it marked increase in nearly all branches of the activities of the depart- ment. But I am afraid this increase can hardly be expected to continue unless our staff in all branches is materially strengthened. 64. The time has now come when cold storage is urgently needed so that an adequate supply of sera can always be kept on hand to meet any emergency, as in the past it has been found that when heavy demands of sera are received from the districts our small stock which we carry at present is inadequate to meet them, and great loss of time occurs in obtaining fresh supplies from Muktesar. In the meantime the disease spreads, causing an unnecessary increase in the animal mortality. 65. A scheme for better reporting of cattle diseases through the agency of the village chaukidars is under contemplation. If this scheme is brought about, great saving of time will be effected in reporting and prompter action will be enabled to be taken to suppress contagious diseases. 66. The department gratefully acknowledges the help which it has during the year received from local bodies. In this connection the Cawnpore District Board may be mentioned as having the largest veterinary staff as compared with its area, and it is hoped that when the Board's funds enable them they will further increase their veterinary activities so that suffering and loss of life amongst domesti- cated animals will be greatly reduced.

(iii) LIST OF APPENDICES. Pages. Table no II.Annual Report on the Civil Veterinary department, United Provinces, for the year 1930-31. CHAPTER I. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. 1. I was in charge of the department as Director throughout the year and was on tour for 92 days, travelling 2,800 miles by road and 1,616 miles by rail. 2. During my tours I visited 22 districts, some of which were visited more than once. The stallion depot at Moradabad was ins- pected on four different occasions in the year. The stallion stands in the districts of Moradabad, Bara Banki, Rae Bareli, Jhansi, and Shah- jahanpur were inspected. I made inspections of 36 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries and also the peripatetic work of veterinary assistant sur- geons during the course of my tours. I attended the All-India Poultry Exhibition held at Lucknow, which was well organized by the Secretary, United Provinces Poultry Association. I also attended the Poultry Exhibition at Etah, which was ably organized by Mr. A. E. Slater, of the Mission Poultry Farm, which is doing good work in advancing the cause of poultry-breeding as a cottage industry amongst the poorer classes. I supervised the serum simultaneous and other operations relating to tuberculosis and Johne's disease carried out on a small scale at the Allahabad Agricultural Institute with satisfactory results. 3. Mr. T. S. Davies, Deputy Superintendent, held charge of the Agra Circle for the whole of the year, vice Major W. H. Priston, who acted as Dirtector of Veterinary Services, Central Provinces, up to December 1.2, 1930, when he proceeded on leave on average pay for even months and ten days, preparatory to retirement on proportionate pension. He remained on tour for 121 days and travelled 3,676 miles by vail and 1,949 miles by road. 4. Khan Bahadur Sheikh Niaz Muhammad held charge of the Allahabad Circle throughout the year under report. During the year he remained on tour for 140 days, travelling 5.310 miles by rail and 2,600 miles by road. He inspected 45 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries in the 15 districts of his circle and checked the work of two itinerating veterinary assistant surgeons. 5. Khan Sahib M. Ghulam Qadir officiated as Deputy Superin- tendent, Moradabad, for the whole year. He was out of headquarters on tour for 136 days, traveling 1,173 miles by road and 5,325 miles by vail. He inspected 23 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries and seven stallion stands, some of which were visited twice and some thrice as necesity demanded. 6. Khan Sahib M. Moin Khan, Deputy Superintendent, held charge of the Jhansi sub-division from the beginning of the year to
( 2 ) December 15, 1930, when he proceeded on leave on average pay for a month preparatory to retirement on superannuation pension. During this time he toured for 84 days, visiting six districts, four stallion stands and twenty-two veterinary dispensaries. He travelled 5,250 miles by rail and 395 miles by road. 7. M. Tahir Mirza, Officiating Deputy Superintendent, took charge of the Jhansi sub-division on the afternoon of December 15, 1930, and continued till the end of the year. He was 41 days on tour, travelling 1,055 miles by rail and 353 miles by road. With a view to give a stimulus to veterinary activities in his jurisdiction and for pro- pagating the cause of the department he has started a veterinary club at Jhansi under the presidentship of Major C. Davenport, R. A. V. C. 8. M. Muhammad Ishaq Khan, officiated as Deputy Superinten- dent, Basti, for the whole of the year under review. He spent 168 clays on tour, travelling 4,825 miles by rail and 1,402 miles by road. He inspected 25 veterinary dispensaries and also checked the work of one itinerating veterinary assistant surgeon in his sub-division. CHAPTER II. TREATMENT OF DISEASES. Contaqious Diseases. Mortality. Table II. 9. During the year under report cattle epidemics were of a lesser virulent type than in the previous year, and the total number of deaths came to 37,756 as com- pared with 48,331 in the year preceding. (a) Equine. Table II. 10. The death roll under this head showed an increase, being 106 against 61 in the previous year. Glanders and Farcy. 11. Six positive cases of glanders were detected during the year, four at Allahabad and two at Gorakhpur. All the animals were from the Mounted Police Force Lines and had to be destroyed, and precautionary measures. required to be taken under the Glanders and Farcy Act, were taken. Anthrax. 12. No case of this disease was reported. Surra. 13. No case of surra was discovered during the year. Dourine. 14. Dourine was not known to have made its appearance in the year. Other contagious dis eases. 15. One hundred and ninety cases of deaths were reported under this head as against 58 last year. These include cases of strangles, piroplasmosis, biliary fever. influenza, etc.
( 3 ) (b) Bovine. Rinderpest. Table II. 16 The disease was of a virulent type during the year, but was milder as compared with the previous year, the death roll for the year being 25,919 against 35,845 in the last year. The number went up to more than a thousand in 7 districts, over a hundred in 32 and below that figure in 9 districts. The highest toil had to be paid by Gorakhpur district, where the num- ber rose to 2,049, and the lowest was in Dehra Pun where it was only 10. The villagers are explained about the adoption of simple measures with a view to avert, as much as possible, the spread of contagious diseases amongst animals, but propaganda work on more proper lines can have better results which cannot unfortunately be organized for want of funds. Anti-rinderpest ino- culations. Table III. 17. The number of inoculations carried out was 131,532 as against 157,677 in the preceding year. The decrease in the number was due to lesser severity of epidemic during the year than in the past, but it could have been a little higher if lesser time were occupied in obtaining supplies of serum from Muktesar. Besides this, 144 inoculations by the serum simultaneous method were performed in the Agricultural Institute at Naini (district Allahabad), which proved satisfactory. Iodine solution in- jection. 18. Treatment of rinderpest by iodine injection method, which was introduced last year, is in progress and is proving useful to the cattle-owners. Foot-and-mouth disease Table II. 19. Cases of foot-and-mouth disease that are reported to have suc- cumbed during the year numbered 1,612 against 2.248 in the previous year. The disease made its appearance throughout the province, with the exception of four districts only, viz., Etawah, Jalaun, Lucknow, and Unao. So far as possible curative method of treatment, coupled with hygienic measures adopted, had beneficial results. Hæmorrhagic Sep- ticæmia. Table II. 20. Six thousand, seven hundred and thirty-eight cases of deaths are reported to have occurred compared with 7.884 during the last year. The disease spread over 43 districts in the province excepting Dehra Dun. Pilibhit, Jhansi, Hamirpnr, and Garhwal. It was severe in the districts of Bulandshahr, Cawnpore, Sitapur, Kheri, and Bara Banki, and was most severe in the district of Kheri, where the number of deaths was the highest. Inoculation. Table III Forty-nine thousand, five hundred and forty-three inoculations were carried out during the year compared with 55,635 in the previous year. Blackquater. Tables II and III. 21. The disease was more virulent during the year than in the past, the number of deaths reported being 1,207 against 529 in the year preceding. Eleven thou- sand five hundred and eleven inoculations were performed by serum.
( 4 ) alone or serum aggressin methods as against 5,708 done in the preced- ing year. Anthrax. Tables II and III. 22. The disease made its appearance in 23 districts against 19 last year. The death roll numbered 495 com- pared with 288 in the previous year. Three hundred and eighty-six inoculations could be made during the year. The disease runs a sporadic and such a sudden course that preventive measures are difficult without receipt of very prompt reports about its occurrence. Other contagious dis- eases. Table II. 23. Four hundred and thirty-nine cases of deaths were reported under this head compared with 178 last year. They comprise cow-pox, pleuro-pnennionia, liver fluke, etc. (c) Other animals. Table II. 24. One thousand one hundred and fifty animals are reported to have died other than the equines and bovines. They include cases of distemper, piroplasmosis, fowl cholera, rabies and other parasitic diseases. CHAPTER III. NON-CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. Non-contagious disea- ses. Table V. 25. The number of cases treated at veterinary hospitals and dis- pensaries was 2,77,312 against 2,55,728 in the pre- vious year. Thirty-seven thousand seven hun- dred and fourteen cases were supplied with medicines but not brought to veterinary hospitals compared with 40,112 last year. The total number indicates a fair increase of work done in this direction. Tables IV and V. 26. Eighty-seven thousand two hundred and seventy-two cases were treated by veterinary assistant surgeons while on tour in the interior of villages which gave relief to the rural population. The number of castratious carried out in the year under review, for which special attention was paid, rose to 16,530 against 3,247 in the preceding year. This large increase gives a favourable impression of the hard work done by the staff, and the highest number has been achieved by Veterinary Assistant Surgeon M. Mustaq Husain of Colonelganj, district Gonda. who alone did l,127 castrations. The Allahabad Circle in general is chiefly responsible for the high increase for which the Superintendent desenves congra- tulations. Cattle poi oning. 27. Fifteen cases of cattle poisoning were reported during the year from six districts and were dealt with ac- cordingly.
( 5 ) CHAPTER IV. VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. Table V. 28. The year opened with 165 veterinary hospitals and dispen- saries. During the course of the year the Aligarh District Board reduced two out of six veterinary dispensaries in the district on grounds of financial stringency. An adidtion of three has been made by re-establishing the Sadar Veterinary Hospital at Mirza- pur by starting a new hospital at Pauri (district Garhwal) and by converting the touring dispensary at Nanpara (district Bahraich) into a stationary one. A veterinary dispensary at Singhai (district Kheri) was started during the year, but for want of funds the District Board closed it down before the year ended. The total number of veterinary hospitals and dispensaries at the end of the year has, therefore, been 166. Grants-in-aid for construction of veteri- nary hospitals. 29. A sum of Rs. 18,994 was contributed to District Boards of Pilibhit, Almora, Garhwal and Shahjahanpur for construction of veterinary hospitals or buildings in connexion therewith. The Almora District Board has been paid Rs. 11,200 for construction of a veterinary hospital at Ranikhet, but the question of half-and-half basis has been waived in their case as the Board was not in a position to pay a moiety of the cost of the buildings from their own resources. A sum of Rs. 3,714 has likewise been contributed to the District Board of Garhwal for construc- tion of servants' quarters for the veterinary hospital. CHAPTER V. LABORATORIES. Laboratory work. 30. Three hundred and fifty-eight smears were examined at the headquarters and Circle laboratories during the year. In addition to these a number of patho- logical, helminthological, and entomological materials were also received and examined. The smears examined were from different species, viz., equine. bovine, canine, ovine, caprine, avian, chital and tiger, and the result of the examinations is indicated as under :( 6) Investigations and experiments on Liver Flukes were carried out during the year. Six villages in Meerut district were affected with this disease. The villages affected were mostly water-logged areas. Treat- ment by administration of Carbon Tetra Chloride gave very satisfactory results, and the experiments proved that it is a specific for this disease It is gratifying to note that the villagers have great faith in this treat- ment and report voluntarily the incidence of the disease immediately on its occurrence. 83. Four hundred and twelve cases were treated at the headquar- ters against 389 last year. A sum of Rs. 940 was reali7ed as fees, com- pared with Rs. 756 in the year preceding. Most of the cases treated were of exceptional interest, and some were of obscure nature. CHAPTER VI. BREEDING OPERATIONS. (i) Horse and Pony Stallions. Table X. 34. At the commencement of the year there were 61 stallions be- longing to the department for horse-breeding in the province, excepting the four districts of Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Bulandshahr, and Aligarh known as the select- ed districts under the Army Remount department. Four stallions were purchased during the year, five were destroyed being old or unfit for further stud purposes, and four died, leaving a balance of 56 at the end of the year. Table XI, 35. Fifty-four stallions were employed at stud during the year and the number of coverings they performed was 1,061 against 2,193 in the previous year. The decrease in the number is attributable to people not taking sufficient interest in the horse-breeding industry. 36. During the year under report a new stallion stand has been opened at Sarai Dadomir (district Bijnor) by M. Amin Chand, Zamin- dar, who bears all the maintenance charges himself. A new stallion stand has also been opened at Balrampur, district Gonda, and a thorough-bred English stallion has been stationed there. The question of opening a stand at Mirzapur was decided by the District Board, but it could not be brought into effect for want of proper stabling arrangements during the year. The stallion stand in Bara Banki district has been held up in suspense since the sudden death of an Arab stallion in July, 1930. The stand at Azamgarh has been closed after the death of an Arab stallion located there on September 19, 1930 as the Board, despite repeated representations, declined to maintain the stand on grounds of shortage of funds. The Gunnaur stallion stand (district Budaun) could not be re-opened during the year owing to the sudden death of the newly-selected Darin- dah who completed the stables for Government stallions.
( 7 ) 37. It is pleasing to note that the progeny of Government stallions is continuing to show improvement. Stallion dépôt. 38. Good work has been done at the stallion depot, Moradabad. which is intended for affording rest or treatment to the stallions which they need after con- tinued standing at stud in districts. New stallions are also kept there for training in their work before being sent for stud purposes. (ii) Donkey stallions. 39. There were 13 jack donkeys during the year, and there was neither any new purchase nor casualty among them. 40. Ten donkeys were at stud work, and their performances num- bered 244 against 243 last year. The average worked to 24.4 per animal. CHAPTER VII. FAIRS AND SHOWS. Fairs and Shows. 41. A number of cattle and horse fairs and shows was held in the province. In the Batesar Fair, district Agra, and in the District Horse Show, Muttra, Mr. T. S. Davies took part in the judging of animals for prizes. Veterinary exhibits were sent to the Batesar Fair and Etawah District Exhibition. At the Dewa Fair (Bara Banki) and Dadri Fair (Ballia) Khan Bahadur Sheikh Niaz Muhammad acted as a member of the judging committee, and he presided over the prize distribution at Kulkula Fair (district Gorakhpur). The District Board, Bara Banki, deputed their district veterinary staff to the Dewa Fair during the year. but the Board did not co-operate by sending a touring veterinary dispensary to the fair and insisted on an undertaking to meet the travelling allow- ances that may be necessary in that connexion. The checking of cattle disease among animals brought to the fair was. however, managed by the headquarters staff who were specially deputed to the fair. Great interest was created by the display of veterinary exhibits sent to Dewa Fair which attracted a large crowd of visitors. Besides these. there were several other fairs and shows in different districts which were organized with the help of the staff of this department who treated sick animals and took precautionary measures against an outbreak of cattle disease among animals brought to the fairs. They were also of great assistance in the distribution of prizes to animals that competed at the fairs. 42. The Allahabad Agricultural Association formed a mobile ex- hibition during the year in which they arranged educating villagers in veterinary aid through lectures delivered by the district veterinary staff. The Association is further endeavouring, through the teachers of Vernacular schools, with the help of printed leaflets to popularize inoculation among the rural population.
( 8 ) CHAPTER VIII. PROPAGANDA. Propaganda. 48. Propaganda work by means of demonstrative lectures and distribution of pamphlets in vernacular on com- mon contagious diseases of animals in India with elementary instructions about suppression of diseases and care of animals, etc., were carried out at the fairs and shows which appeared to have some effect on the stock-owners. Lectures on cattle-farming and the means of combating an outbreak of cattle disease were delivered at the Kulkula and Debi Patan Fairs, where the advantages of scientific veterinary aid in successfully carrying out agricultural operations were also explained. Much more is needed for propaganda on proper lines, but the question of suitable materials and staff, for which funds are necessary, stands in the way of progress. CHAPTER IX. Establishment. Establishment. Table VII. 44. The subordinate staff of the department, as it stood at the end of the year, was as follows :( 9 ) Tours of veterinary inspectors. 48. The veterinary inspectors toured at an average of 187 days per man during the year, travelling 28,861 miles by rail and 16,983 by road at an aggregate figure. They inspected 2,262 villages in the course of their tours. Lecture on cattle disease to different schools. 49. Instructive lectures on the common ailments of domesticated animals, their causes, treatment, etc. were delivered by the staff of the department during the course of their tours as enumerated below :( 10 ) 52. My thanks are due to Khun Bahadur Sheikh Niaz Muham- mad and Mr. T. S. Davies, Superintendents, Allahabad and Agra Circles, respectively, for the good work they have carried out during the year; also to my deputy superintendents and veterinary inspectors. 53. A scheme was drawn up and approved by Government for the reporting of cattle diseases by village chaukidars as an experimental measure and was to be tried in the districts of Gorakhpur, Cawnpore and Budaun, but as no funds could be provided the scheme had to be shelved until funds are available. 54. A scheme for the organization of veterinary aid in rural areas was submitted to Government, but as it involved the question of making the Municipal Boards pay for veterinary aid which they receive within municipal areas the scheme has not as yet received Government sanc- tion. 55. I should like to bring to the notice of Government the name of Rai Bahadur Chaudhri Gur Narain, who proposes to hand over property to a trust from the income of which a veterinary hospital should be maintained at Mahewa (district Etawah) ; also to Chaudhri Badan Singh, Rais of Takha, district Etawah, who has, at his own expense, built a veterinary hospital and has proposed to give landed property to meet the running charges of the institution. 56. Experiments were carried out at the Allahabad Agricultural Institute Farm against tuberculosis and Jolne's disease with satisfac- tory results. Also the herds were inoculated with serum simultaneous method. 57. A veterinary inspector. who has had special training in the work, has been appointed on that branch of work, and it is hoped in the near future that this method will be carried out on a much larger scale as has been recommended by the Royal Commission on Agriculture. 58. Treatment of rinderpest by Kaolin and Iodine methods has been tried, but it is too early to come to any definite conclusion. 59. Seven sanads were awarded during the year to the following gentlemen for the great help they rendered to the department :( 11 ) 60. It may be noted that all-round increase has been effected in the work of the department which shows that good work has been done by its small personnel. 61. The work of both the technical and clerical staff has been most satisfactory during the year., and I should specially like to bring to the notice of Government the names of the following officers:( 12 ) TABLE II.
