SAUNDERS, O.B.E., M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Director of Veterinary Services, Madras AND RAO SAHIB K. KYLASAM AYYAR, G.B.V.C., Superintendent, Serum Institute, Madras. (With Plate I and 82 Charts.) (Received for publication on 30th July 1935.) In connection with the problem of combating rinderpest in India, several methods of protecting cattle against the disease have been evolved from time to time, but the question of cost stood in the way of the serum-simultaneous method being adopted throughout the country, though this method seemed to offer an efficient protection. In the search for a cheaper method of affording protection against the disease what is known as " the goat-virus-alone " method has come into prominence during the last three or four years. Stirling [1932, 1933] has recorded his views on the use of goat virus-alone on a fairly large scale in the Central Provinces and Kerr and Menon [1934] have also recorded the work done with goat-virus-alone in Bengal. It appears that the initial supply of material for these goat-virus-alone inoculations was from the Imperial Institute of Veteri- nary Research, Muktesar. Edwards [1927] says that " prolonged and intensive research has led to means being devised whereby the virus can be easily propa- gated in goats by successive inoculation with small quantities of blood," but this virus was then intended only " to overcome the distressing complication often observed after the serum-simultaneous inoculation caused by the unwitting introduction of virulent piroplasms with rinderpest." Since Koch [1896-97] made his observations on the behaviour of the rinderpest virus in goats, there have been attempts in various parts of the world to find out the extent, if any, of its practical application in immunising cattle against rinderpest. Bliss [1922] in China and Topacio [1926] appear to have been the first to put it to practical use. It is generally accepted that rinderpest virus may be attenuated by succes- sive passages through goats, yet in none of the available literature is any mention made of experimental work designed to show how and under what conditions rinderpest virus becomes attenuated through goats to such a degree as to make it safe for use on bovines as an immunising agent without the anti-serum. A
2 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, I This paper is an attempt to supply the omission and to place on record the results of an experimental study of rinderpest virus with a view to determine whether successive passages of the virus through goats would so alter the virus as to make it safe for use as a vaccine for protecting cattle against the disease without anti-serum. In other words, the aim of the experiment is to find out (1) whether there is a progressive attenuation of the virus as it passes from goat to goat ; (2) at what stage of this attenuation is the virus safe for use as a vaccine for protecting cattle against rinderpest ; (3) whether the attenuation through goats is so progressive as to render the virus innocuous after a certain stage is reached, or whether the virus after a certain stage in its attenuation becomes " fixed " in its virulence for goats and (4) whether this " fixed " virus is capable of being maintained indefinitely by passage in goats. It is obvious that these points have an important bearing on the practical application of the method, especially when it is intended to replace the serum-simultaneous inoculation which is universally acknowledged to be the best in the field for conferring lasting immunity against rinderpest. The experiment was started in August 1932 and was so designed as to use two goats for each passage and a bovine as control. During these 34 months, 150 unbroken passages have been completed. All the goats used in this experi- ment were of the type commonly met with in this Presidency (Plate I, Figs. 1 and 2) and were obtained locally, and the controls were mostly buffalo-calves of local breed of the kind used at the Madras Serum Institute for to produce rinderpest bull virus for serum-simultaneous inoculations. These animals are of more than average susceptibility. A summary of the observations recorded is set out in Table I appended. As it would take up a great deal of space if the temperature charts of all the experimental animals were included, only 31 temperature charts (IInd. Jour. Vety. Sci. & Anim. Husb. Vol. VI, Pt. 1.

It is not known for how long this strain of virus had been main- tained through goats at Muktesar before it was received, but this virus has been put through 95 direct passages in goats at this Institute.

STUDIES ON THE DETERMINATION OF DIGESTIBILITY COEFFICIENTS : II. THE ESTIMATION AND COMPUTATION OF DIGES- TIBILITY COEFFICIENTS FROM INDIVIDUAL TESTS AND THEIR ORDER OF PRECISION BY M. CARBERY, D.S.O., M.C., M.A, B.Sc, Agricultural Chemist to the Government of Bengal, AND INDU BHUSHAN CHATTERJEE, L.AG., Physiological Chemist, Bengal.* (Received for publication on 30th July 1935). INTRODUCTION In a recent paper by Carbery, Chatterjee and Hye [1934]. a method of experi- mentation and computation has been described, which is likely to ensure a greater degree of accuracy in arriving at the digestibility values of individual feeds and their components in a mixed ration. The chief point in favour of this method is that it enables direct estimation of the digestibilities without having recourse either to the use of assumed values (from standard books) for one or other items of the mixed feed, or to the alternative of conducting the trial with a single feed in the first instance, followed by the combined feed. The method developed by the above authors is the result of an elaborate test involving eighteen individual estimations conducted in a cyclic order on six animals in a restricted randomised distribution. It need hardly be stated that the larger the number of tests and animals, the greater is the accuracy and representative character of the mean values. At the same time it cannot be overlooked that an increasing number of tests implies increasing outfits in staff, material and expenses. Thus, in many cases, it is not possible to have a large number of tests owing to shortage of men, money and materials. On such an occasion a shorter method can be the only possible way to meet such special requirements. The development of a method giving a reasonable order of accuracy in such a contingency will be of great practical value. Naturally since the initiation of original tests this aspect engaged the close attention of the authors, and in the present paper a partial solution of this complicated problem * Under the grant of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, India. (87)
88 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, I has been attempted by directing attention to two main lines of approach, viz., (1) the method of computation and (2) the minimum number of tests necessary for a certain specified standard of accuracy. METHOD OF COMPUTATION With respect to the method of computation a mathematical formula can be satisfactorily worked out, in fact, has been done. It is based, of course, on the assumption that the behaviour of the animals is uniform. This assumption is implicit in all digestion tests and has been made by all investigators. If the animals were perfectly uniform, the data obtained from a test performed on one single animal would be quite sufficient to work on this formula. In such a case the equation can be set up on the following basis. If R and C represent the amount of roughage and concentrate actually consumed and if D be the amount digested from the combined feed, then in a course of two digestion trials we get the following simultaneous equations :STUDIES ON THE DETERMINATION OF DIGESTIBILITY COEFFICIENTS 89 In this way, we can obtain the individual digestibility of two, three or more feeds by conducting two, three or more trials depending on the number of feeds used. Theoretically, such a procedure would be free from any blemishes, if at the same time it satisfies the primary condition implicit in such an experiment, viz., that the animal used behaved with mathematical uniformity. This, how- ever, is next to impossible in actual practice. We have, therefore, to ascertain, what should be the minimum number of animals compatible with a reliable estimate of digestibility coefficient. From the statistical standpoint, it is necessary to estimate the digestibility coefficient independently from a number of animals and then test the agreement between the results obtained. The closer the agreement, the greater the preci- sion of individual estimates, hence the smaller the number of animals (i.e., repli- cations) required for the test. But we must theoretically have, at least a dupli- cation, if not more to obtain an estimate of the precision of a single observation. This principle of replication must be kept in view to obtain an objective estimate of the precision in all possible cases and it is exactly for this purpose that field experiments in agriculture are always replicated. There are, however, instances where the test has been confined to one single animal. In such cases, the calcula- tion of digestibility on the basis of the above equation can be the only alternative, despite its serious inherent limitations. It will, however, be obvious that being based on the results of a single animal (in other words single observation in the statistical sense), it will not be possible to determine the extent of reliability of the digestibility coefficients. If, there- fore, one or other sets of observations deviate appreciably from the normal condi- tions, the estimates of digestibilities are bound to be correspondingly affected without there being any means to detect their extent. Similarly, if the sets happen to be normal ones, the results are expected to be as much satisfactory as is possible within the range of the experiment. Such uncertainties in the calculation of digestibilities should, however, be avoided, as far as possible, in scientific investi- gations. We should, therefore, have some definite knowledge as to what should be the minimum number of replications necessary to attain a certain specified standard of statistical accuracy. This will naturally imply a large number of individual tests. We have a fairly large number of data from another experiment leading to the paper on the estimation of digestibility coefficients [1934] and an analysis of the same would serve as a proximate index of the extent of deviation of a single observation. It will, therefore, be necessary at this stage to give a short outline of the ex- periment conducted with regard to the above paper. This experiment was based on graphical representation and multiple regression equations with respect to two feeds, viz., aman paddy straw and linseed cake, the latter being in doses of 1 lb.,

We have, at present, little knowledge regarding the fate of the food materials and their respective components during the course of their digestive processes in the alimentary canal of the herbivora. What is under existing convention assum- ed as digested is really the difference between the feed and what is obtained as undigested residue in the faeces. This does not take into account the secondary transformations taking place during digestion, nor such fractions or parts of feed, which although evacuated may still be capable of digestion. There is then the fact that faeces also contain excretory waste products from the body in addition to the undigested residues of the food, and as Armsby [1910] has remarked " the presence of so-called metabolic products in the faeces may give rise to serious errors in the determination of digestibility of some ingredients in the food, notably fat and protein." In another place, Armsby [1903] has remarked that in " extreme cases, absurd results are sometimes obtained such as negative digestibility or a digestibility greater than 100 per cent". He [1910] has further expressed an apprehension of " the possibility of conversion of members of one group of nutrients into those of others." In fact, the recent investigations of Woodman and Stewart [1932] on the mechanism of cellulose digestion (by fermentation), show that in the case of oil cake the ether extract fraction seems to undergo such transformations as to assume an insoluble nature thereby showing an apparent increase in fibre. While this refers to bacterial fermentation, the present authors feel that the possibility of some changes of like nature in the animal system are not unlikely, thus giving an apparent increase of the fibre content of faeces and correspondingly lowering or giving a negative value of the fraction representing digestion. At any rate, the process is full of complexities and they find ample illustration in the figures set forth in Table III. With respect to paddy straw the standard deviations for the digestibilities of dry matter, organic matter, crude fibre and to some extent Nitrogen-free Extract are comparatively small, ranging between 8 to 19 %. The corresponding standard deviations of the same components under cake are how- ever much higher, being 19.3 to 38.2% for dry matter and 22.5 to 40.97% for organic matter, whereas it has been unusually high in the case of crude fibre, the climax being over 487% in one set (Table III, column 9). Again the standard deviations for crude protein and ether extract under cake have been quite low, ranging from 5.38 to 8.75% in the former and 6.11 to 13.95% in the latter, whereas the same for paddy straw have been very high particularly with respect to crude protein where in one set it has worked out at 533.65% (Table III, column 6).
STUDIES ON THE DETERMINATION OF DIGESTIBILITY COEFFICIENTS: 95 The divergencies are naturally indicative of both high and low rates of diges- tion, the higher values sometimes working out above cent per cent and the lower ones receding into negative values. If we compare the standard deviations in relation to the procedure of cal- culations by the three different groupings, viz., 1 lb. and 2 lb., 1 lb. and 3 lb. and 2 lb. and 3 lb., we note that in the midst of all the divergencies, the standard deviations with respect to the calculations under 1 lb. and 3 lb. grouping, have been uniformly low, except in one solitary instance of crude fibre under cake. It might be noted here that the difference in the amount of cake consumed is largest in the case of 1 and 3 lb. as compared to 1 and 2 lb. or 2 and 3 lb. This might partially account for the low error, as in the estimate of digested amount (the equation being on a linear basis) a given error in the slope representing diges- tibility will necessarily be reduced when such difference is greater. It need hardly be stated here that the figures have been worked out from the data of an experiment where every attempt was made to obtain reasonable uniformity in the selection of the animals, regarding age, live weights, feeding and other treatments. Yet it is very difficult from the very nature of the animals to maintain a strict order of uniformity. In other words there is bound to be some difference due to variation amongst the animals. The standard deviations in columns 5 and 8 in Table III, thus represent the total variability arising out of (1) experimental errors and (2) variations amongst the animals. As already stated, the standard deviations of some particular components such as crude protein of paddy straw and crude fibre of linseed cake are enormously high. As the experimental order of procedure was identical in all, the experimental errors are also expected to be of an identical order. It is unlikely that in these cases alone the experimental errors were particularly high. Assuming, therefore, a more or less similar order of experimental error, it may be tentatively suggested that the digestibility coefficients with regard to these components are more susceptible to variation than those of others. But unless the extent of this susceptibility is brought within the range of measurable estimation, it is bound to affect the accuracy in proportion to the degree of such susceptibility. To that extent the values obtained will necessarily be affected. Yet, until we have some means to eliminate such variability, we have to proceed on an assumption that the behavior of the animals is uniform. This assumption is as much implicit in the already prevailing method of computation as it is in the one now suggested. It is obvious that if there is a mathematical uniformity in the process of digestion, the application of the equation (formulae 3 and 4) is fully justifiable and the results obtained even from a single animal would be fully dependable. Since however, strict uniformity in animals is out of the question in actual practice, the only alternative, as has been stated before is to replicate the experiment adequately in order that the mean values so obtained are dependable. N
96 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, I MINIMUM NUMBER OF TESTES NECESSARY FOR RELIABLE VALUES This naturally leads to the question as to what should be the minimum number of replications to warrant a certain specified standard of statistical accuracy. For this purpose we can use the well known formulae :STUDIES ON THE DETERMINATION OF DIGESTIBILITY COEFFICIENTS: 97 A study of these figures will show that the comparatively low standard devia- tion under the calculation basis of 1 lb. and 3 lb. combinations (a reference to which has already been made) have been correspondingly reflected in a lower number of required replications. For a better comparison they are reproduced in the following table :98 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, It should be borne in mind, as has been mentioned already that with respect to crude fibre of linseed cake, and crude protein and to some extent ether extract of paddy straw, there are other factors eluding experimental control. Leaving these exceptional cases, it may be broadly stated that if we set a limit of, say, 10% error, the maximum replication should be about six. If it is 15 % the repli- cation should be 3 for all, except with respect to crude protein of paddy straw, where with three replications the error will work out at a figure exceeding 25%. One will often have to be satisfied with such a large error when other considerations will require us to limit the number of replications to 3. It is necessary to state here that apart from the limited available data with which the validity of the formulae has been tested, these figures are from an experiment conducted on three different planes of nutrition. It has been assumed as a first approximation that the digestibilities at these different planes were the same and constant. It is not known how far the preponderance of one food- stuff reacts on those of the other. Possibly a number of tests on the same plane of nutrition might provide data for testing the validity of the formulae on one side and the extent of difference in digestibility under the different planes of nutrition. For the present such figures are not available but if circumstances permit they will be tried. In the meantime, the results so far obtained are placed before other workers so that, if possible, they may also give a trial to the procedure. The results dealt with are with reference to two feeds on the basis of formulae 3 and 4. It has not been possible to try the formulae 8, 9 and 10 with respect to three feeds as the requisite data were not yet available but theoretically their validity rests on identical principles. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 1. In view of contingencies where the amount of food material may not be sufficient for an extensive test, the admitted necessity of shorter method has led to two lines of approach, viz., (i) method of computation and (ii) the minimum number of tests necessary for a certain specified standard of statistical accuracy. 2. The method of computation has led to the working out of the formulae : - x = D1 C2STUDIES ON THE DETERMINATION OF DIGESTIBILITY COEFFICIENTS: 99 3.

M. SARWAR, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Investigation Officer, Punjab AND B. N. HANDA, B.Sc, M.R.C.V.S., Assistant Superintendent, Stock, Government Cattle Farm, Hissar. (Received for publication on 3rd August 1935) INTRODUCTION In the heart of Hissar district, with an area of some sixty-three square miles, is situated the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, where for many years cattle of the finest Indian breed have been reared by the Punjab Government. The Bir or grass-lands of this farm are of very wide extent and cover an area of about 21,000 acres. The number of livestock on this farm amounts to several thousand heads. The farm stock is distributed in different places, at a distance of several miles from one another. The distribution is given below :SEVERE AND WIDESPREAD OUTBREAK OF RINDERPEST 101 Fig. I shows the distribution of the livestock at different places, and. the roads connecting them.

Strength of the stock.102 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, I HISTORY OF THE OUTBREAK A heifer was brought for treatment from Kherwan to the Farm Veterinary Hospital, situated in the Home Farm, on the 27th June, 1934. This animal mani- fested marked depression and dullness. The ears were drooping and the back arched. The muzzle was dry and the skin lustreless. Rumination was absent and the respiration accelerated. The next day tears were running profusely from the eyes. There was only a slight elevation of the body temperature. The bowels were constipated. Two or three days after, small protuberances and vesicles developed on the neck, before and behind the shoulders, along the vertibral column and in the flank. In the mouth, especially on the mucous membranes of the lips, gums, and under the tongue some irregular erosions were seen but there was nothing characteristic about them. The next day the animal died and on making a post mortem examination, the disease was confirmed as Rinderpest. In the meantime, the disease at Kherwan flared up and a few more animals began to manifest symptoms. But the entire smyptom-complex was only excep- tionally present in a single animal. In the Kherwan herd in some animals the functional disturbances of the respiratory organs or those of the digestive were more in the fore-ground, while in others a simultaneous affection of all organs was present in varying intensity. In most cases the illness was of a very short duration and the body temperature showed a slight elevation. In the great majority of these severe cases, the disease lasted on an average from four to seven days. The disease was brought under control at Kherwan by the serum-alone method but within a fortnight or so it broke out in the Home Farm stock and also spread to cows and calves at Bobran. The source of infection was definitely traced to the villages which are situated in the close vicinity of the farm and use farm roads as means of communication. The total loss, so far, was 80 and the situation appeared to be very grave on account of the high susceptibility of the farm stock. Edwards [1925], in his paper on ' Some recent advances in the protection of cattle and other animals against disease ', states as follows :SEVERE AND WIDESPREAD OUTBREAK OF RINDERPEST 103 progeny that have grown up in the interval that the' virus ' finds a medium at hand for its ready propagation and, concomitantly, progressive exaltation of its disease-producing properties." This explanation of Edwards applied in a remarkable degree to the suscep- tibility of the farm stock which had remained free from this disease for a number of years. According to Haupt it requires from 5 to 6 weeks before the disease affects all animals of a herd consisting of 15 to 20 animals. Consequently rinderpest did not spread very rapidly in large herds of the farm in the outbreak under report. CONTROL OF THE OUTBREAK Kerr and Menon [1934] report that goat blood virus alone and goat tissue vaccine alone was used successfully on an extended scale in face of the disease in Bengal, and similar conditions being the experience in this province, it was decided to control the outbreak by means of goat virus alone vaccination. To commence with, it was decided to immunise the female produce at Kher- wan which were then free from infection. These inoculations at Kherwan were meant to serve a dual purpose ; firstly to immunise the animals which were becom- ing once more susceptible on account of the passing off of the serum effects and, secondly, to study the nature of the reactions to be expected in the main herd. Consequently 1,151 heifers and 33 bullocks were inoculated with the goat virus. It was then decided to tackle the main infected herd where goat tissue vaccine was brought into use. Any animal exhibiting the slightest signs of ill-health was excluded from the vaccine inoculations and segregated for observation. In all, the following number of incontact animals were vaccinated :104 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, I REACTIONS IN THE CASE OF BLOOD VIRUS In some animals typical rinderpest reactions, following the injection of virus, were seen. In others graded reactions of the same type were witnessed, which in most cases consisted of fever only. All the animals subjected to goat virus were examined twice daily and, if found to be suffering from severe reaction, treatment was taken up immediately. In highly susceptible animals, there was a sharp rise in temperature, usually not later than the fifth day after inocula- tion, which persisted for 3 days and towards the end of this period the appearance of vesicles occured in the mouth. The percentage of reactors, in this case, was found to be 75. The degree of febrile reaction was also studied and it was found that in case of blood virus, the reaction was more pronounced, the temperature ranging between 103 5° to 106°. These animals also showed a well-marked depression. Six heifers showed excep- tionally severe reactions and had to be fed on succulent diet for a few days, but none needed any special medical attention. REACTION IN THE CASE OF GOAT TISSUE VACCINE In the case of goat tissue vaccine, the temperature did not rise beyond 104º, the majority of animals showing 103° to 103.5°. The percentage of reactors was only 50. There was hardly any depression in these animals. TEMPERATURE RECORDING The temperature recording was carried out in the following manner. Out of each batch of animals inoculated during the course of a day, 20 animals were selected at random and their temperature was recorded on the 4th, 5th, and 6th day after the inoculations. In this way, 40 blood inoculated and 80 goat tissue vaccinated animals were brought under observation. VACCINTION OF UNAFFECTED SEGREGATED ANIMALS The male stock at Chowni was temporarily excluded from these inoculations as there appeared to be no immediate danger of the disease spreading to that area. On account of its natural segregated situation, there was every possibility of the place remaining free for at least a number of days, and so every attention was paid in this period to incontact vaccinated animals. After the completion of work with the general herd the vaccine inoculation of the male produce was then undertaken. 1,173 male calves and 26 bullocks were vaccinated. During the course of these inoculations a case of rinderpest occurred amongst the lot of bull calves that were still uninoculated. The incontact animals were immediately isolated and vaccinated with goat virus vaccine. Out of these in- contacts, 6 more calves developed Rinderpest. Evidently these animals were in
SEVERE AND WIDESPREAD OUTBREAK OF RINDERPEST 105 the incubation stage of the disease at the time of vaccination. These were then subjected to serum treatment and cured. The outbreak was brought under control within a period of 12 days with the loss of 18 animals from the time of vaccination or inoculation measures being undertaken. Out of the cows and young calves at Thaska and Sully, which were in contact with the affected animals at the time of the outbreak, 80 animals developed rinder- pest and were treated with anti-rinderpest serum (class P or II) in doses ranging from 100 c. c. to 250. In some cases these injections had to be repeated three or four times according to the condition of the patient. The total number of animals inoculated with goat blood virus and goat tissue virus were :106 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VII. PREPARATION OF VACCINE Both the blood and tissue vaccines employed at the farm for the immunisation of cattle were supplied by the Pathological Section of the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore. The attenuated goat virus employed at the Punjab Veterinary College for the purpose of manufacturing blood and tissue vaccine, was obtained from the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, about 2 years back and maintained by continuous passage in local bred goats. The blood virus issued for use at the farm was 24 to 48 hours old. It was supplied in the form of whole blood mixed with equal parts of 1 per cent sodium citrate solution. The dose of the citrated solution of goat blood virus was 2 c. c. per head. The goat tissue virus used at the farm was about 1 to 15 days old. It was despatched from the Lahore College in ampoules each containing one gramme piece of spleen tissue. The maceration and dilution of vaccine was carried out at the farm according to the instructions issued by the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar. Each one gramme piece of spleen was macerated in 100 c.c. of normal saline solution and used in 1 c. c. dose per animal. The blood and tissue vaccines were despatched from the College, per passenger train, packed in ice and saw dust. During the course of these inoculations it was sometimes necessary to keep a quantity of tissue vaccine over-night. In such instances the material was kept in a cool dark place packed in a large quantity of ice. CHOICE OF THE VIRUS The choice between the two types of virus is very difficult. It is not yet definitely ascertained that a febrile reaction is necessary for conferring lasting immunity. But, if immunity is assured only when the animal body reacts to the vaccine, then there is no doubt that blood vaccine is definitely better than the tissue vaccine. If, however, this is not essential, then there is no doubt that the tissue vaccine is to be preferred in the field inoculation work. It is easy of applica tion in the field, its cost of production is extremely low ; its distribution is inexpen sive, and its longer viability in storage is its greatest outstanding feature. Kerr and Menon [1934] in their note regarding the use of goat virus as a means of controlling rinderpest outbreaks observe that goat blood vaccine was not suitable for general application in the field as it necessitated the presence of more experienced officers to control the operations. Besides, it was impracticable to maintain at headquarters, a large stock of potent goat blood vaccine. On the other hand, the goat tissue vaccine was easily prepared and preserved in sealed ampoules which were quite handy for packing and despatch by post. Moreover,
SEVERE AND WIDESPREAL OUTBREAK OF RINDERPEST 107 one goat produces 2,000 to 2,500 doses of tissue vaccine as compared with some 500 doses of blood virus. So far our experience coincides with the above workers of Bengal regarding the utility and use of the goat blood virus and the goat tissue vaccine. CONCLUSIONS We may sum up the position very briefly by saying that means are now abundantly to hand for combating natural outbreaks of rinderpest in the condi- tions in which they prevail in the Punjab. The goat virus method has now reached a state of perfection when no obstacle need reasonably be placed against its adoption on the grounds of excessive risk. Edwards [1929] in his address on 'The problems of Rinderpest in India ' read by him at the Conference of the Central Provinces Veterinary Association, held at Nagpur, November 1928, remarked that the system of protection most suitable for adoption in India is one of widespread vaccination and we entirely endorse his views on the subject. The authors desire to record that Mr. S. M. A. Shah, the Farm's Senior Veterinary Officer, was in charge at the time of the outbreak of this disease, but owing to his transfer subsequently he was unable to collaborate in the writing of this article.

(Received for Publication on 7th December 1935.) FOREWORD Several bony diseases affect poultry. These may be either neoplastic, in- flammatory, or constitutional in their origin. Though pathological conditions occur commonly in bones, yet very little is understood regarding their nature. The technical difficulties associated with their histological examination are many and the introduction of such terms as calcareous infiltration, calcification, ossifica- tion, exostosis, osteitis, osteo-sclerosis, hyperostosis and the like merely convey an idea of the nature of such changes. Diseases occurring in bones go by different names depending upon their origin, situation, and histological characters. When neoplastic in origin, they may grow out as exostoses in the form of excrescenes from the outer surface of a bone or may grow in and project into the medullary cavity. In some instances, the matrix becomes dense resulting in ' compact or ivory osteoma'. The majority of the osseous growths appear to be inflammatory in origin, as for example the formation of a callus round a fracture. Sometimes, the infiltration of chronic inflammatory foci with calcium salts may simulate bone formation and it must be remembered that the nature of the majority of bone tumours may be very difficult to interpret. Diseases of constitutional origin also affect the skeletal system in poultry. These are all grouped under nutritional or vitamin deficiency diseases such as asthenia (going light), gout, rickets, osteoporosis, osteomalacia and osteitis de- formans. Osteitis deformans is the name applied to the morbid process which usually affects the entire skeleton in adult life. It is a chronic constitutional disease characterised by the deposition of a fibro-osteoid tissue in such an excess as to enlarge and harden the affected bones. This kind of chronic osteitis is of a formative type, in which there is new formation of bony tissue from the osteogenic layer of the periosteum and sometimes also from the endo-osteum in the medullary canal giving the bone an ivory like consistency ; the other kind is known as the rarefying type in which there is absorption of bone, which is replaced by granula- tion tissue, as in tuberculosis and actinomycosis of the jaw in cattle. This note is intended to record briefly an unusual condition of the limbs seen in two fowls. The cases are of further interest as they revealed spirochaetes in their blood in addition. (108)
NOTE ON OSTEITIS DEFORMANS IN TWO FOWLS 109 SUBJECTS. In the month of August 1934, a condition quite analogous to the one described by Kaupp [1933] under "Osteitis deformans" was met with in two adult leghorn fowls. Both the fowls developed a striking enlargement of the legs which attracted the attention of the owner. The fowls, a cock and a hen, were brought to the Veterinary College Hospital for observation and treat- ment. (Plates II & III, Fig. 1). SYMPTOMES. In both the fowls, the lesions appeared to be one of Osteitis affecting the long bones, viz.110 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, I DISCUSSION. The condition described above should be differentiated from scaly leg and productive inflammation of the soft structures of the shank of fowls, which also develop without any signs of acute inflammation. The shank, in the latter affection, gradually becomes larger due to newly formed connective tissue, but the increasing enlargement is limited to the soft structures alone, the bony tissue not being involved. A skiagram will reveal its true nature. The condition of chronic osteitis may either be a sequel of certain constitutional disturbances such as " Osteitis deformans " or ' rickets ', or it may result from chronic bacterial infections such as tuberculosis, actinomycosis and gummatous osteitis. As regards the causation of Osteitis deformans in man, various theories have been proposed and many infectious agents have been held responsible including the organism of syphilis. It was held, by some, to be due to the effect of the disturbance of some internal secretion. There appears to be little evidence in support of these views. MacCallum [1924] refers to this condition as " Paget's disease " and, in 1876, he described it in human beings as affecting the bones of the extremities and the skull. It is further observed that the changes in some cases may be unilateral or may be limited to one or two bones. The condition progresses slowly with some tenderness and pain in the altered bones. The marrow loses its blood forming elements and becomes converted into a vascular fibrous tissue which produces much soft bone-like tissue ; the marrow cavity is encroached upon and filled completely. The softened bone later assumes an ivory-like hardness. So Paget inclines to the view that the process is of an inflammatory nature, resulting in enlargement and excessive production of imperfectly developed osseous tissue which becomes organised. MacCallum [1924] in dealing with gummatous osteitis, describes a form in which the new production of bone is more extensive than in the periosteal type and states that it is deposited in each Haversian system and through the cancellous bone in the interior so that the shaft of the bone becomes dense and ivory-like and the whole bone is much heavier than normal. Kaupp [1933] has described the condition of ' Osteitis deformans ' as occurring in fowls and observes that Goldman has described a case in fowls affecting the front part of the skull and the long bones, including the femur, humerus and metatarsus. Many have held that rickets, osteomalacia and osteitis deformans are manifestations of the same disease bearing on impaired nutrition and deranged matabolism. It is supposed that, in the course of calcification, a certain amount of the sulphur of the matrix is replaced by other elements, which must entail the retention of calcium, magnesium and phosphorus and involve the increased elimi- nation of sulphur. Kaupp states that DaCosta and his co-workers interpret the retention of calcium, magnesium and phosphorus with excessive excretion of sulphur found

ESTIMATION OF VITAMIN-A RESERVE IN THE LIVERS OF SOME FARM ANIMALS BY K. C. SEN, D.Sc., Biochemist, Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, AND G. K. SHARMA, G.P.V.C., Clinical Assistant, Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore. (Received for publication on 20th December, 1935). INTRODUCTION A considerable amount of discussion has centred round the suggestion of Green and Mellanby [1928] that vitamin-A increases the resistance of the animal body to bacterial infection, and the clinical work carried out by Mellanby and Green [1929] on the effect of vitamin-A- therapy in cases of puerperal septicaemia, which gave apparently beneficial results, appeared to indicate that the administra- tion of this vitamin might find a wide application in the treatment of infectious diseases. This hope has not so far been realised. Thus Harris, Innes and Griffith [1932] found that the infections observed in cases of vitamin-A deficiency are of a special type limited in origin to epithelial tissues, and not seen in the absence of neighbouring keratinization, and that the existing data afforded no basis for the belief that vitamin-A therapy was likely to bo effective in combating acute general infections due to specific pathogenic micro-organisms, or in those clinical toxaemias and infectious diseases which are unassociated with the peculiar struc- tural breakdown of epithelial tissue, and the attendant localised infec- tion, which characterises the vitamin deficiency. The observations of Wolff [1932] and Moore [1932] on the vitamin-A reserve of human livers in health and disease have also shown that it is extremely difficult to correlate a low reserve of vitamin-A in liver with any particular type of infection. The trend of Moore's work, however, suggests that partial vitamin-A deficiency, or the state of mul- tiple malnutrition which it must usually imply, may be of importance in the etiology of some types of infection under the conditions usually observed in clinical practice. It is also now realised that in many cases vitamin-A therapy may not increase the storage of this vitamin in the liver. Thus Green [1932] found that the vitamin-A reserves were low in most puerperal cases, and that they might remain low even after large amounts of vitamin-A had been administered thera- peutically. He gives reasons for believing that this is not due to lack of absorp- tion of vitamin-A when taken by the mouth, or to significant loss through urinary (128)
VITAMIN-A IN THE LIVERS OF SOME FARM ANIMALS 129 excretion, but rather to a failure on the part of the liver cells to assimilate and elaborate the vitamin when it reaches them in large quantity before it is either destroyed or passes into general circulation. As the livers of diabetics contained, according to Wolff and Moore, a very high reserve of vitamin-A due to the inges- tion of the large quantity of carotene obtained from the vegetable diet, it appears that, if Green's explanation is considered correct, the activity of liver cells in storing vitamin-A may vary in different diseases. It was, therefore, felt desirable to obtain some data on the vitamin-A reserve in the livers of some farm animals, in health and in disease, and in this preliminary report the results obtained are given. METHOD OF VITAMIN-A ASSAY The Carr-Price method of estimating the vitamin, as modified by Davies [1933], has been used. Usually 5 grms. of liver was saponified with 10 c.c. of aqueous 5 to 10 per cent potassium hydroxide, and the unsaponified fraction twice extracted by means of ether, with the addition of some alcohol for the first extraction. The ether fraction was finally freed from water by shaking with anhydrous sodium sulphate and then quickly evaporated. In all essential parti- culars, the procedure adopted by Davies was used, and the method in our hands has given quite good results. The tintometer used was the B. D. H. pattern with artificial light attachment. The results are expressed in Moore's units per gram of the liver to the nearest significant figure. In all the data given in this paper, only the blue units are tabulated. The yellow or the red units of the tinto- metric readings have not been tabulated. Having decided on the method of assay, it was thought necessary to determine (1) if there was any difference between the vitamin content of the central and the peripheral portion of the liver, (2) if decomposition for 4 or 5 days at room tem- perature would have any effect on the vitamin content, as it was realised that in some cases it was possible that the liver might not be sampled and put into potassium hydroxide solution for some days, and (3) if the relation between the tintometer blue units and the concentration of the unsaponifiable fraction actually used in the experiment (indirectly giving the amount of original liver) would be linear. In Tables I, II and III, these results are shown. From the data given in Table I, it is apparent that there is a slight difference in the vitamin content of the central and the peripheral portion of the liver, the value of the central portion being higher and that decomposition for four or five days (without KOH) does not materially affect the vitamin value (Compare Davies, loc cit.). The results given in Tables II and III (excepting those of the goat) are shown graphically in Figs. I and II. C

[Compare Norris and Church, 1930]. For obvious reasons, tests could not be carried out at very low dilutions. Our results are in general agreement with those available in the literature. [Cf. Chakravorty, Mukherjee and Guha, 1933 ; Datta and Banerjee, 1934, on fish oils]. From these
134 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, II data it appeared that for comparative purposes, only the central portions of the livers should be saponified and that as far as possible, blue units obtained from the same amount of the original liver should be compared. It has, however, been found that the latter requirement is almost impossible in practice, because even among the same species, low amounts of the liver extract of healthy animals gave measurable Lovibond readings, whereas with the diseased ones, comparatively much greater amounts of the liver extract had to be used for accurate measure- ment of the colour. While, therefore, an attempt was made to use the same amount of the liver for the colour estimation, a second arbitrary standard of colour was also chosen, namely between 3 and 5 blue of the Lovibond scale (as suggested by Davies) and suitable amounts of material were used to give a blue colour with the antimony trichloride reagent within this range. Without these precautions, especially the weight of the material used, a comparison between the blue units of animal livers, even of the same species, loses much of its value because of the great variation in the Moore units per grm. of liver when different amounts of the liver are used for their determination. In Tables IV, V, VI and VII, the vitamin-A reserve in the livers of several species of animals under different con- ditions are shown. The actual amount of liver used in the determination of the blue units is shown in the tables in every case It must be noted that an accurate comparison between two or several animals having a very high and very low vitamin content is not possible under the conditions found in this investi- gation, and as such only a rough comparison could be made.

In this preliminary work, however, we have not been able to standardise the feed and chose animals with comparable nutritional history. It may be that for this reason the vitamin-A reserve in the livers of even healthy animals has shown considerable variation. Thus the values of vitamin reserve in healthy hill bulls lie within the range of 250 to 438 blue units in three animals (a very insufficient number; numbers 7 and 13 might be considered practically healthy) with an average of 362 units, and in the case of healthy goats, within a range of 725 to 1,125 in five animals with an average of 943 units. In the case of hill bulls, 10 days on a vitamin-A deficient diet appeared to lower the reserve of this vitamin in the liver only to a slight degree. It is, therefore, of interest to note that hardly in any case do we find a blue value in the liver of an animal (bull or goat) suffering from a disease closely approaching the average blue value observed in the livers of healthy animals of the same species. This observation seems to indicate that in certain diseases such as rinderpest in bulls and goats, there is a possibility that the vitamin-A reserve in the livers may be depleted. Whether this is a direct effect of the disease or due to inanition following upon the inappetence and digestive irregularities due to the lesions caused by the disease cannot at present be stated. It may be pointed out here that in our routine rinderpest work, the animals (bulls) actually going through the disease are not supplied with any green pasture (maximum period from the onset, 15 days). In the case of goats, green leaves are supplied ad libitum, but no grain ration is given during this infection. As already observed in the case of bulls on vitamin-A deficient ration, this withholding of green fodder for a short period is not likely by itself to lower to any considerable degree the vitamin reserve in the livers of bulls going through an attack of rinderpest. Ad- vanced tuberculosis and Theileriasis in bulls also apparently lead to a diminu- tion of the vitamin reserve. One animal, Bull 55, was drenched with B. Pyocaene- ous, but did not become clinically infected. Curiously enough, this animal's liver also gave a low vitamin-A value. A histopathological examination of the liver showed mild congestion and early cirrhosis. In the case of rabbits only healthy animal livers have been examined to provide comparative data. It is well-known from Mellanby's work [1934] that avitaminosis A produces serious disorders in this species of animal. In the case of horses, apart from the foal which might be expected to have a low vitamin reserve, both the other animals had suffered from paralysis and were destroyed. As far as is known, the diet supplied was of the usual type and contained green fodder. The blue values appear to be low, but as no livers from healthy animals were available, no comparison can be made. The vitamin reserve of the calf liver seems also to be low.
VITAMIN-A IN THE LIVERS OF SOME FARM ANIMALS 139 No other animals have as yet been studied by us, but some references, often of a qualitative nature, are available in the literature. Thus Rosenheim and Webster [1927] stated that fats of the sheep, calf and ox contain on the average as much as ten times the amount of vitamin-A as a good New Foundland cod liver oil. Wilson [1927] made a comparative study of the vitamin-A content of extracts of the livers of several animals. Wolff, Overhoff and van Eckelen [1930] studied rabbit liver and Dann [1932] gives some data showing the passage of vitamin-A from the mother to the foetus in the rabbit. Moore [1932] has given some quantitative data on the vitamin-A content of the livers of different breeds of cattle and has shown that breed has a very important effect in this connection and Davies has given some data on sheep, ox and pig livers. Some work on the vitamin-A content of pig liver has been reported by Dunlop [1934, 1935]. Lastly, mention must be made of the interesting investigation of Guilbert and Hart [1934] on the storage of vitamin-A in cattle and of Guilbert and Hinshaw [1934] on vitamin-A in poultry livers. If a comparative study of the storage capacity of the livers of healthy animals of different species for vitamin-A as given in this paper is made, it is found that goat liver has a reserve which is more than twice that of the bull liver and six times that of rabbit liver. Since carotene, which is the main source of vitamin- A in these animals, is supplied in fairly high amounts through the green feed, it is likely that the marked variation in the vitamin-A reserve of the livers in these three species of animals is due to a difference in the metabolism of carotene by these species. Whatever the explanation may be, goat liver appears to be a good source of vitamin-A. SUMMARY A study has been made of the vitamin-A reserve in livers of several species of animals by the antimony trichloride test. It is found that the central portion of the livers usually contains more vitamin than the peripheral portion, that reasonable delay in sampling the liver does not produce any noticeable change in the vitamin-A content and that the relation between the blue units and the amount of the material used for estimation is not linear at the dilutions studied in this investigation. There is a possibility that certain diseases, e.g., rinderpest in bulls and goats, and advanced tuberculosis and Theileriasis in bulls may lower the vitamin-A reserve, but this requires to be confirmed. Healthy goat liver contains a much higher amount of vitamin-A than that of bulls, rabbits and (probably) horses, and appears to be a good source of this vitamin.

RAM AYYAR, B.A., Third Assistant Agricultural Bacteriologist. (Received for publication on 12th July 1935). Empirical natural starters in the form of curds or buttermilk for making butter continue to be used in the Indian homes and by gowallas, the professional dairy men in India, even up to the present time. Such starters were also in common usage in Europe and America till about the year 1890, when after the rise of the science of bacteriology, a discovery was made independently by Storch in Denmark, Weigman in Germany and Conn in United States of America that certain bacteria, which produce lactic acid from lactose in milk, were the causative agents in the souring of milk or the ripening of cream. The investigations of Storch led the way to the use of bacterial cultures first in Denmark for ripening cream in place of the empirical starters consisting of buttermilk from previous churnings of good butter which were used before. The chief findings of the classi- cal discovery in the process of cream ripening and the investigations immediately following it show that different kinds of lactic acid bacteria induce different kinds of souring : (1) some give a clean sour taste, (2) some produce high acidity, (3) others give an unpleasant tang, (4) while still others give a mildly acid but strongly aromatic taste. The bacterial cultures used as starters were, at first, considered to be pure cultures of a single variety of the lactic acid organisms. The organism commonly found in such culture starters is the variety which is predominant in sour milks and recognised as Streplococcus lactis, (Lister) Lohnis. Orla Jensen has named the variety occurring in well-ripened cream in dairies as Streptococcus cremoris (Orla Jensen) and distinguishes it as different from S. lactis on account of some differences in morphological and cultural characters. Both these organisms, however, produce the same amount of lactic acid from lactose in milk and are similar in many res- pects. It was soon realised that pasteurised cream, when inoculated with pure cultures of any of these lactic acid organisms and ripened, did not always yield a butter of full aromatic odour and mild acid flavour as was obtained with some natural starters, i.e., mixed cultures used in certain dairies. This led to the suggestion that there may be some other organisms responsible for the flavour in butter from particular dairies which were renowned for their butter. A search was, therefore, continued by bacteriologists for isolating and securing cultures of (141)
142 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI , II bacteria, other tann the lactic acid organism, in the dairy starters which produced butter with full aroma and good flavour, as well as in commercial starters made from such dairy starters. The discovery that two different types of bacteria are present in good starters was made in the year 1919 independently in three countries. Bokehout and De Vries [1919] in Holland, Hammer and Bailey [1919] in U. S. A., and Storch [1919] in Denmark found that mixed cultures of S. lactis (Lister) Lohnis or S. cremoris (Orla Jensen) and another type of organism when inoculated in pasteurised cream produce the characteristic aroma of good butter. This type of organism is called S. citrovorus or S. paracitrovorus by Hammer, ' X' bacteria by Storch and ' Betacoccus cremoris ' by Orla Jensen. Although named differently, these organisms appear to have the common characteristic of producing aroma in butter. While engaged in an investigation of lactic acid organisms in dahi, the prin- cipal starter used by Indians, we made attempts to find out whether the dairy products in India contained any flavour-forming organisms, similar to those just mentioned and whether their activity continues throughout the year or is res- tricted to any particular season. In this connection we examined several samples of milk, dahi and butter by plating on purple lactose agar and making pure cultures from single colonies appearing on the plates. While examining the cultural characteristics of the several organisms isolated by us we came across one organism which coagulated milk at 21°C. without any gas and with little acidity after incuba- tion for 24 hrs. The flavour of the curd produced by this organism was different from the flavour produced by the usual lactic acid organisms present in dahi. Hence this organism appeared to combine in it the characteristics of both the lactic acid producing and aroma-producing organisms, and we considered it likely to be useful in dairy practice. A detailed study of the cultural and morphological characteristics of pure cultures of this organism was, therefore, made and its ability to produce flavour in butter was tested by using it as a starter for ripening pasteurised cream. The results of this study are included in this paper. EXPERIMENTAL (1) Isolation:AROMA-PRODUCING LACTIC AClD ORGANISM 143 From samples of (a), (b) and (d) several strains of streptococci were obtained of which many proved to be S. lactis (Lister) Lohnis, while a few isolated from butter samples appeared different. From samples of (c), in addition to streptococci, another organism similar to the Bulgaricus type was most frequently isolated. From milk samples in the cold season, strains of streptococci, similar to those from butter samples, could be only occasionally isolated. (2) The ability of the different organisms to produce volatile acidity.144 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, II Three of the organisms did not produce any appreciable amount of volatile acid nor did they show any marked increase in volatile acidity after addition of citric acid, but the streptococcus from butter shows in milk alone a high volatile acidity, which is further increased by the addition of citric acid to milk. The number of c.cs. of N/10NaOH required for neutralizing the distillate from S. citrovorus culture as recorded by Hammer [1920] are 20.3 without citric acid and 57.3 with citric acid on an average, while for S. paracitrovorus the numbers recorded by Hammer [1923] are 28.6 in milk without citric acid and 73.9 in milk with citric acid, the least number of c.c. of N/10NaOH required for neutralising the distillate from milk and citric acid culture of S. paracitrovorus being 44.4. Judged by a comparison with these two sets of results, the streptococcus isolated by us from butter appears to be a citric acid fermenter more akin to S. citrovorus.

As a combined result of the judgments of several persons, it was found that: (i) Streptococcus lactis butter had no flavour and was mildly acidic. This butter stood second in the order of merit according to the judgment by taste of different persons. (ii) Bulgaricus type butter had a decided acid flavour and a strong acid taste. This butter stood third in the order of merit. (iii) Streptococcus from good butter gave a mildly acid tasting butter. It had also aroma and flavour. This butter stood first in the order of merit. The experiment was repeated three times with identical results. (5) Large-scale cream-ripening tests.146 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, II As this result confirmed the one obtained at Pusa, there is little doubt of the superiority of this organism as a starter in dairy practice in India for producing flavour in butter. It may not be out of place to point out here that the superiority claimed is in respect of the use of single cultures only. It is possible and perhaps natural to find, as was our experience in other investigations not reported here, that a mixture of two different cultures may give a better-flavoured butter than the one produced by a pure culture of the streptococcus under study used singly. The cultures of the flavour-producing streptococcus investigated by us may not be necessary for those dairies which may already be using starters which contain the flavour-producing organisms in addition to the usual lactic acid orga- nisms ; but dairies which are using indifferent starters will certainly benefit by resorting to the use of cultures of the flavour-producing organisms similar to the one investigated by us.

To the first fraction (25 c.c.) of the distillate were added a mixture of the following solutions: 2 c.c. of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (20 per cent solution). 3-5 c.c. of sodium acetate (20 per cent solution), and 1-2 c.c. of nickel chloride (10 per cent solution) and warmed to 80°c. If the first fraction showed a significant precipitate, the reagents were added to the second fraction (75 c.c) of the distillate. The quantities of the reagents given are sufficient for about hundred mgms. diacetyl according to Van Niel [1927]. The distillate with the reagents was allowed to stand for 24 hours for complete crystallisation. This can also be accomplished by heating it to one hour on a water-bath at 80°C. The nickel salt precipitated is then filtered into a weighed crucible, washed and dried to a constant weight at 105°C.148 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, II forms acetyl-methyl-carbinol-and diacetyl, but afterwards utilises these compounds for its own use or decomposes them. This would be in accordance with the results of Michaelin et al [1933]. A fresh experiment was, therefore, carried out and the products determined in separate flasks containing milk and citric acid which were inoculated with the organism under study and distilled with steam at different periods. The results are given in the table below :AROMA-PRODUCING LACTIC ACID ORGANISM 149 Purple lactose agar.150 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, II (3) the necessity of introducing such organisms where they may not be already present in the starters if improvement in aroma and flavour of the butter is desired, and (4) the fact that we have a culture of such an organism which has been found useful in improving the aroma and flavour in comparison with the organisms usually present in many localities in India and with which a beginning may be made for improving the flavour of butter till such time as the dairies can develop their own starters containing the best aroma producers suited to their locality. SUMMARY Examination of a large number of samples of milk, cream and butter in India shows that the organisms producing aroma in butter are comparatively of rare occurrence in these products. Hence there is a necessity of introducing these in starters in dairies where they may not be present if the quality of the butter is to be improved. One such organism isolated by us from a sample of good butter and its ability to ripen cream properly have been studied, and these tests have shown that when used as a starter, a butter of better flavour and aroma is obtained as compared with the lactic acid organisms likely to be present under local conditions in several Indian dairies. The cultural and morphological characters show the organism described by us to be similar to S. citrovorus and S. paracitrovorus, but on account of its marked ability to produce lactic acid, combined with the property of producing aroma in butter, we have named it S. lactis aromaticus nov. sp.

BHATIA, D.SC., F.Z.S., F.R.M.S., Principal, Government College, Hoshiarpur. (Received for publication on 5th November, 1935.) I have read with interest the paper by S. M. Sarwar in the June (1935) Num- ber of this Journal. He has briefly reviewed the previous literature dealing with records of various Piroplasmidea from goats and sheep both in this country and elsewhere, and given a fairly adequate description of a form that he came across in smears made in the course of a post mortem examination of a goat. There is a vast amount of literature dealing with Piroplasmidea, and good deal of confusion prevails as regards the nomenclature of various genera and species. It should, therefore, be the desire of every worker to avoid adding to that confusion, and be- fore one describes any organism as a new species, he should see that his observa- tions are correctly made and interpreted, and carefully compared with the exist- ing descriptions of similar organisms. I have no fault to find with his description or the microphotographs and the coloured plates that accompany it, but on ac-count of an error of interpretation he has been led to regard it as new species, and to place it in a genus to which it does not belong. GENERAL REMARKS Before dealing with the specific organism, I would like to make a few general remarks. The earliest record of piroplasms of goats in India is not of Krishna Iyer [1932], but of Lingard and Jennings [1904], who studied and figured the piro- plasms from a large number of domestic animals including the goat. Christophers is quoted by Dschunkovsky and Urodschevich as having remarked that the para- sites found in sheep in North and South India differ from each other and from the forms described from other countries. Towards the conclusion of his paper Mr. Sarwar observes as follows : " The generic name of Piroplasma has been retained on account of the in- admissibility of the three recognised genera Babesia, Nuttalia, and Theileria ". I am aware of the fact that certain authorities stick to Piroplasma Patton [1895], as a generic name, instead of Babesia Starcovici [1893], which has priority over it; and that Nuttalia Franca [1910], is now generally regarded as one of the synonyms of Babesia and not a separate genus. But I wonder what is the author's authority for considering Theileria Bettencourt, Franca and Borges [1907], as inadmissible : Theileria is a well established genus, which is so distinctly marked off from Babesia, that the two are placed in separate families by du Toit [1918], (151)
152 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, II Wenyon [1926], Reichenow [1929], and other authorities on the subject. Du Toit classified the Piroplasmidea into two families, Babesidae and Theileridae, each containing a number of genera. Wenyon considers the division into two families as justified, but regards each family as containing a single genus, viz. Babesia and Theileria. The characters of the families may be summed up as follows: Family BABESIDAE Poche, 1913. Non-pigmented parasites of the red blood-corpuscles of mammals which multiply in the corpuscle by division into two or four. They are of varying size and shape, but usually arrange themselves in pairs of pear-shaped individuals. The forms in the corpuscles are asexually reproducing individuals, and possibly some are gametocytes. Genus Babesia Starcovici (1893). Family THEILERIDAE du Toit, 1918. Non-pigmented parasites of the red- blood corpuscles of mammals. Schizogony takes place in the endothelial cells of the capillaries of the internal organs and the schizonts (" Koch's blue bodies ") produce a number of merozoites. The parasites finally invade the red corpuscles, within which they occur as round, ovoid, rod-like or irregular forms. They show no tendency towards a paired arrangement. The forms in the red corpuscles do not reproduce, and are possibly gametocytes. Genus Theileria Bettencourt, Franca, and Borges [1907]. It is by no means easy to decide whether a particular form met with in the peripheral blood is a Babesia or a Theileria. In the former, the organisms are pear-shaped, and reproduce in the blood-corpuscles into two or four daughter individuals which consequently show a tendency to pair. Sometimes, however, as many as a dozen or more parasites can occur together in a single corpuscle. This increase in numbers is due to budding or to multiple infection, and is not comparable to the multiple fission as it takes place in Plasmodium. The parasites produce no pigment, but destroy the corpuscles in which they are contained, and set free the haemoglobin which is excreted by the kidneys of the host, producing haemoglobinuria. In Theileria, on the other hand, schizogony takes place in the endothelial cells of the capillaries of the internal organs and forms produced there enter the red corpuscles and are seen in the peripheral blood. Unlike Babesia, they do not multiply in the red corpuscles. The blood is consequently not infec- tive when inoculated to healthy animals unless endothelial cells containing schi- zonts happen to be present. Yakimov [1931] has given a useful and practical scheme of dividing the genus Piroplasma Patton into two sub-genera, Piroplasma s. str. and Babesiella Mesnil, dividing the species belonging to the latter into two groups again. This scheme should however be followed, if at all, if the species under consideration is definitely ascertained to belong to Babesia (Piroplasma) and not to Theileria. SPECIFIC IDENTITY OF THE FORM Now we shall turn our attention to the particular species under reference. According to the description of Piroplasma taylori as given by the author, the parasites are mostly ovoid or round, pear-shaped forms being rare. When single
PIROPLASMA TAYLORI SARWAR 153 parasites are found in a cell they measure 2 µ by 1.5 µ . Although single parasites are frequently seen, it is also not uncommon to find two, four, eight and sixteen elements in one red cell. Another feature is the occurrence of a fairly large num- ber of parasites in extra-cellular forms. The occurrence of eight and sixteen ele- ments in a red cell as also the occurrence in fairly large numbers of extra-cellular forms is quite unusual for a Babesia, and shows that the organism is a Theileria. But the author rules it out by his remark that " the absence of Koch's blue bodies in the smears excludes the possibility of this parasite belonging to the genus Thei- leria ". Now what are the extra-cellular bodies showing multiple division (vide his plates VI a and VII) *if they are not schizonts or Koch's blue bodies ? No doubt ordinarily in Theileria Koch's blue bodies are found in endothelial cells of internal organs, but they have also been observed in peripheral blood in certain species. The author has compared his form with the three species of Babesia and with Theileria hirca previously known from goats. Although he mentions Dschunkovs- ky and Urodschevich's paper [1924] in his list of References, it is obvious that he did not consult the paper in the original, as the following misstatements of facts would clearly show. He mentions (p. 172)* that T. hirci is characterised by the presence of Koch's blue bodies in the lymphatic glands and internal organs, and in his table (p. 175)* states that the species is characterised by the presence of haemoglobinuria. In both these respects, the statements made are quite contrary to the original description. I quote the relevant portions below :154 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, II Theileria hirci Dsch. and Urod., was described from goats in Siberia in 1924. The same year Lestoquard recorded Theileria ocis as a parasite of sheep in Algoria, and found the schizonts in the liver, spleen, kidneys, and bone marrow, and observed a transient haemoglobinuria on the second day of the disease. Wenyon [1926] regards this species as identical with T. hirci Dsch. and Urod. Other forms correctly referable to Babesia and Plasmodium have also been recorded from goats, but I shall not discuss them here. REFERENCES Dschunk ovsky, E., and Urodschevich, V. (1924).

VET.), M.R.C.V.S., Research Officer and Professor of Pathology and Bacteriology, Bihar Veterinary College, Patna. [Received for publication on 22nd February, 1936.] (WITH PLATE IV.) Several distinct species of pigmented parasites of the red blood corpuscles belonging to the genera Hoemoproteus and Plasmodium have been recorded from different species of birds. Although practically nothing in the case of members belonging to the genus Hoemoproteus, and very little in the case of members of the genus Plasmodium, is definitely known of the possibility of one and the same spe- cies occurring in different hosts, recent investigations have tended to prove that probably many of the several distinct species, primarily created only on the assump- tion that each parasite is specific to the host in which it occurs, do actually exist. Reference to the check list given by Wenyon [1926] and the available literature shows that pigmented parasites of the red blood corpuscles of the peacock (Pavo cristatus) have not hitherto been described. The object of this note is to place on record the finding of a halteridium in the peacock and its being apparently the cause in this bird of a disease which proved fatal. The finding was made during the course of routine examination of the blood smears submitted by the hospital to the laboratory. The peacock was brought to the hospital on the 28th of July, 1935. The owner related that the bird was suffering for a week from what appeared to him to be a serious illness, as its mate had died a week ago showing practically the same symptoms. It was off feed, dull, its head hanging down. The feathers were rough and the appearance was very poor. It was passing white and slimy faeces. There was a white sticky discharge from the eyes. Temperature at that time (morning) was 107°F. The body was covered with lice, visible mucous membranes were anaemic and the bird was so weak that it was unable to stand. EXAMINATION OF THE BLOOD Examination of the blood smears revealed that a large number of the red blood corpuscles contained intracorpuscular parasites (Plate IV). Such corpuscles, however, did not show any deformity either of the cytoplasm or of the nucleus. Among the corpuscles free from parasites slight anisocytosis was observed. (155)

With Plate V and four text-figs. For both chemical and physiological studies, it is the general custom to draw sample of blood from the jugular vein, after casting and securing the animal. This method has been found to have many disadvantages. The first and foremost is straining the animal to such an extent that the composition of the blood is likely to vary during the time of sampling. Peters and Van Slyke have stated in the Quantitative Clinical Chemistry Interpretations, " There is concentration of Erythrocytes and Haemoglobin during exercise and shock ". Secondly, taking blood samples from pregnant animals is impossible as casting a pregnant cow is not to be thought of. Further, casting a cow even when not pregnant may result in injury to the animal. Lastly blood has to be drawn from animals under diges- tion experiment. When such animals are cast, it always happens that both urine and faeces are lost and the digestion experiment is spoiled. Waste of time is also a point for consideration when many animals are to be bled on the same day. So, a method had to be devised for drawing blood from the animal in a standing pos- ture. The animal has, therefore, to be firmly secured, so as to prevent it from mov- ing backwards or forwards or from lying down or jumping up, at the same time, giving it the least exertion and pain thereby the chances of accidents are mini- mised. A detailed description of the travis recently put up in the Animal Nutri- tion Section at Bangalore satisfies most of the requirements. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG 1.

NEW BLEEDING TRAVIS 159 The travis which is simply a modified dressing travis as used in the Veteri- nary Hospitals, consists of (1) Fixed wooden frame, (2) Front plank, (3) Sling pad, (4) Press pad and (5) Neck rope. The sketch (Fig. 1) overleaf is a picture of the wooden frame with all the measurements. The front posts are longer than the back ones, the posts carry two horizontal bars in the middle with holes at suitable lengths to receive cross-bars and the horizontal bars at the top do not reach the last vertical posts. For cross-bars, pieces of G. I. pipings 1½ in are found suitable as they are strong and round. The two front posts carry two iron guards 2 ft. long in front of which one is fixed and the other movable from a horizontal to a vertical position with fixing arrangements. These iron guards hold the front plank in position as shown in the sketch (Fig. 1). The front plank is 3 ' × l ' 11 " and is padded on one side and fixed between the guards with the padding inside just before the animal is brought in. This plank apart from holding the animal protects the operator also from injury. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 2. Figure 2 is the sling pad. This is only a stuffed gunny bag to which three thick ropes (preferably cotton or jute) of sufficient length are stitched on.

Figure 3 is the press pad, which is another stuffed gunny bag about half as wide as the one described above to which four similar ropes are stitched on. This cushion is placed over the back of the animal and the ropes on both sides are tied to the bottom horizontal bars.

Figure 4 is the neck rope, which has a neck loop and two long ropes on both sides. The loop enclosed in a padding is fixed at the yoke place and the side ropes are pulled tightly back and fixed to the middle vertical posts. Besides the above parts, three or four pillow-shaped gunny cushions are made use of, one of which is tied to the post to which the animal's head is turned and fixed, by means of a muzzle rope tied to the post for bleeding from one side. Similarly other cushions are placed wherever the animal gets a moving space and wherever the body comes in contact with the hard wooden frame. In a bullock the nose string helps a great deal in securing the head but in a cow the nose string is replaced by the muzzle and neck strap which is generally used for horses and the head is strapped to the front post. All the edges and corners are rounded and smoothened. The sharp edges of the holes are also rounded to prevent wear and tear of the ropes of sling and press pads. Working of the Travis.Ind. Jour.

STUART J. COWELL, Professor of Dietetics, St. Thomas's Hospital Medical School, London. [Reprinted from Nature, May 4, 1935, pp, 716-718] The twenty-five years of His Majesty's reign which are now being celebrated correspond remarkably closely with the establishment of a new era in the science of nutrition. At the opening of the twentieth century, attention was being focused on the quantitative relations of the energy exchanges of the body and on the metabolism within the body of the proteins, fats and carbohydrates of the food. The physiologists and chemists working at these problems were making most valuable contributions to the body of knowledge concerning the processes of nutri- tion, but such contributions were for the most part not of such a nature as to afford obvious clues either to the origin of or to the treatment of disease. The second decade of the twentieth century witnessed the rapid development of the view that the adequate nutrition of an animal depended on the presence in its food of hitherto unsuspected elements. The absence of such essential elements from a diet was proved to result regularly in the appearance of predictable signs of disease and the fundamentally new idea of deficiency diseases became gradually established in current medical teaching. Before mentioning any of the effects which this new conception of nutrition has had on the problems of the prevention and treatment of disease, it will be useful to hark back to the 'pre-Georgian' era to review the current teaching of the medical profession regarding the relation of diet to disease. The fact that faulty diets are often the direct or indirect cause of disease was of course fully recognised, as it had been for many centuries. But there was little precise knowledge available to enable definite diseases to be ascribed to specific dietetic errors. Over-eating was regarded as predisposing to many gastro-intestinal diseases, gout and raised blood pressure, and under-eating was considered to render the body more liable to invasion by harmful bacteria. The idea of lack of balance between the various classes of foodstuffs, for example, relative excess or deficiency of protein, carbohy- drate or fat was looked upon as at least an important contributory cause of disease. In the case of scurvy, it was already taught that the absence from the diet of some principle which was present in fresh foods but not in stale foods contributed largely to the production of the disorder. Otherwise the production of disease by faulty diet was largely related to the presence of toxins, pathogenic bacteria or living para- sites in food which had become accidentally contaminated. (162)
DIET AND DISEASE 163 With regard to the practical dietetic management of diseases now known to be due to specific dietetic faults, the degree of divergence between the methods of twenty-five years ago and of the present day is distinctly less than would have been expected from a consideration of the knowledge available then and now. Specific remedies in medicine have again and again been discovered empirically and this is true in the realm of dietetics. The treatment recommended twenty- five years ago by at least some enlightened authorities for many of the diseases now spoken of as deficiency diseases would prove satisfactory enough to-day, although such treatment was based on no actual knowledge of the dietetic factors involved. Scurvy was treated by giving fresh fruit and fresh vegetables, rickets and osteomalacia by giving cod liver oil and milk, beriberi by increasing the ' nitrogenous ' constituents and diminishing the carbohydrate of the diet 164 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, II attained by those engaged in studying the effects of vitamin deficiencies encourag- ed the investigation of the effects of other deficiencies, for example, deficiency in the mineral components of the diet, with the result that in such fields also many observations of the greatest importance have been made which have already prov- ed invaluable alike in clinical and in veterinary medicine. The period of nutritional research which we are surveying had already been heralded by isolated suggestions regarding the importance of dietetic factors other than proteins, fats, carbohydrates and minerals salts for the maintenance of health. Already in 1897, Eijkman had published his experiments on the production of beriberi, which led ultimately to the discovery of the antineuritic vitamin. Hop- kins had stated in 1906 his conviction that scurvy, rickets and probably other states of ill-health were caused by unknown dietetic errors the nature of which was bound up with a defective supply of obscure food components. In 1907, Hoist and Frolich paved the way for the identification of the antiscorbutic vitamin by producing experimental scurvy in guinea pigs. But it was not until Hopkins had demonstrated in 1912, the fundamental importance of accessory factors in the diet for securing normal nutrition that the idea of specific food deficiencies as a cause of disease began to gain any general acceptance. It is common knowledge that since Hopkins's original announcement the num- ber of accessory food factors or vitamins generally recognised as being concerned in animal nutrition has been steadily increasing, though not all of them have been shown to be concerned in the production of human deficiency diseases. By the end of the first decade of King George's reign, overwhelming evidence had been produced to show that beriberi was produced by deficiency of the water-soluble antineuritic vitamin, Xerophthalmia by deficiency of a fat-soluable vitamin, rickets by deficiency of the same or a similar vitamin and scurvy by deficiency of the water-soluble antiscorbutic vitamin. It is not possible to trace in detail sub- sequent investigations which have led on one hand to the chemical indentification of many of the vitamins and on the other to some understanding of their physiolo- gical action. It must suffice to point out how such knowledge has been applied to the prevention and treatment of disease. In countries such as Great Britain, frank vitamin-deficiency diseases, with the single exception of rickets, are uncommon, but there is increasing evidence that partial deficiencies of vitamins, particularly during the period of growth, are often responsible for sub-optimal physical development, imperfections in the structure of bodily organs and tissues, lowered resistance to certain infective diseases and many vague subjective and objective symptoms of ill-health. It is almost certain, for example, that mild degrees of skeletal deformity caused by faulty feeding in childhood help to raise maternal mortality in childbirth by increasing the mechanical difficulties of labour. The low resistance of the teeth of large sections of our popu- lation to decay with its many sequelae of chronic disease and ill-health is due in
DIET AND DISEASE 165 large part to faulty development of the teeth during the early years of life brought about by dietetic faults, of which vitamin-D deficiency is the most prominent. Similarly it has been shown that, in dogs at least, the tendency to the develop- ment of pyorrhoea alveolaris in adult life is largely determined by the supply of vitamin A which was available during the period of growth. These few illus- trations must suffice to indicate that the original conception of vitamin-deficiency diseases has extended its boundaries to include a variety of diseases attributable to past dietary deficiencies, preventible by suitable feeding during the period of growth. Similar results have been achieved during the period under review by the study of specific mineral deficiency diseases. Prominent among those mineral elements deficiency of which in the diet may lead to recognisable symptoms of disease are iron, copper, iodine, phosphorus, calcium and magnesium. Lack of sufficient iron in the food has been shown to result frequently in the development of anaemia. Such nutritional anaemia is particularly common in infants, and is accounted for by the fact that milk is a poor source of iron. The recognition of this form of anaemia has proved to be of considerable practical importance because it is often associated with an increased susceptibility to many of the common complaints of infancy and can be corrected with great ease. The enormous amount of work that has lately been carried out on the relation between iodine deficiency and the development of goitre has not yet completely solved the problem of the causes of thyroid enlargement but it has certainly provided very successful methods of wholesale prophylaxis in districts where goitre is endemic. Lastly may be mentioned the revolution in the cattle-rearing industry of South Africa which has followed the discovery of phos- phorus deficiency as the immediate or ultimate cause of serious losses in this branch of agriculture. There can be no question that already the modern conception of nutrition has produced practical results of immense significance in both preventive and cura- tive clinical and veterinary medicine. The results are not confined to the pro- phylaxis and treatment of diseases which arise as the result of actual deficiencies in the food supplied. They have already been extended to include the treatment of diseases in which defects in the absorption or utilisation of particular food ele- ments rather than faulty diets are responsible for the development of co-existing signs of deficiency diseases. The term ' secondary deficiency disease ' is now being used to distinguish this particular class of nutritional disorder. In this group might well be placed that once fatal malady pernicious anaemia, which the brilliant researches of the past decade have shown to be amenable to simple dietetic treat- ment, although there is no evidence that dietetic errors play any part in its causation. As more and more precise information is gained concerning the intimate processes of metabolism within the body, there should be
166 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI , II increasing opportunities of preventing and successfully treating disease by adjusting the diet to influence those metabolic processes which may produce the symptoms of disease when they deviate from their normal course. This has long been one of the aims of clinical medicine; its ultimate realisation has surely been brought one stage nearer fulfilment by the nutritional investigations of the past twenty-five years.
VIRUSES AS THE CAUSE OF DISEASE BY DR. JOSEPH A. ARKWRIGHT, F.R.S., Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, London. (Reprinted from Nature, Vol. 135, No. 3418, May 4, 1935.) At the end of the nineteenth century, a new category of infective agents was discovered which are now classed as viruses, in the modern sense of the word. The chief property which unites them, and by which they have been distinguished from previously known minute parasites, is the extremely small size of their com- ponent particles, since these are smaller than bacteria, and many of them are not visible even with the highest powers of the microscope. Until quite recently, it was customary to speak of all viruses as invisible, but in some cases the minute granules of which the virus appears to consist can be clearly seen, when stained, by direct microscopic observation ; but in most cases they cannot be distinguished by their shape, but only by their uniformity, numbers and their source in special parts of the diseased tissues. The recent investigations by Barnard with the ultra-microscope and photo-micrography by ultra-violet light have added to our knowledge of their size and form. A special feature by which the invasion of the cells of the host by many viruses can be recognised is the occurrence of' cell inclusion bodies '. These forms of which there may be one or more in a single cell vary in size and. may be larger than the nucleus. Opinion as to their nature has undergone various vicissitudes. After their discovery, when they were at first hailed as protozoal parasites, they were for long regarded as merely reaction products of the cell protoplasm to the presence of the virus, a position now favoured for the ' inclusion bodies ' associated with virus diseases of plants. More recently it has been shown that in some virus diseases of animals these ' inclusion bodies ' consist of masses of the minute fil- terable forms of ' elementary bodies ' held together by a soluble matrix. These bodies have been most completely and fruitfully studied in fowl-pox, small-pox, vaccinia, ectromelia168 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, II shown to cause a disease of animals, was discovered in 1898 by Loeffler and Frosch. It passes through finer filters than any other known virus, so that no question of visible particles has arisen, since massed granules or inclusion bodies have not been observed. The most essential qualifying characteristic of a virus has ever since been its filterability. Most viruses remain active after being dried over sulphuric acid, and some are more resistant to alcohol and certain other disinfectants than bacteria. Many viruses are present in the tissue juices in high concentration, and such suspensions in liquids can still prove infective when diluted 1 in 105 or 1 in 106. The resem- blance in many respects of a virus to an excessively minute bacterium has led to the belief in their similar nature which is now held by most pathologists. It must be admitted, however, that part of the argument is based on analogy, since viruses cannot be subjected to the same tests as bacteria to prove that they are living agents causing disease. Besides the small size of the ultimate particles of a virus and the resulting absence of a recognisable differentiating morphology, there are certain other pe- culiarities distinguishing these two classes of agents. Bacteria, with few exceptions can be propagated on sterilised artificial culture media, and can be obtained in pure culture by the method introduced by Koch of selecting single colonies grown on a solid sterile medium. By this means their infective and other activities can be examined without the risk of contamination with substances derived from the host. A virus, on the other hand, in most cases requires the presence of living cells of the host to enable it to multiply, and it often appears to grow only or chiefly inside the cells of the animal tissues. Artificial culture of a virus can, however, very often be maintained in pieces of animal tissue kept alive and growing apart from the body. The virus of fowl-pox, vaccinia or vesicular stomatitis of the horse and of some other diseases can also be propagated in the living embryo in an incubated hen s egg. The fact that tissues of a host are needed to enable viruses to multiply has led to the suggestion that the virus may not necessarily be alive but may only serve as a stimulus to the host cells, causing them to reproduce the virus, and that the particles seen in a suspension containing a virus and indeed the virus itself are really products of the host. This suspicion has been especially strong in the case of the infective transmis- sible sarcoma of fowls described by Rous, which can be reproduced by injecting a filtered cell-free extract of the diseased tissues into a normal fowl. The resemblance of avian sarcoma to other virus diseases extends to the recognition by Ledingham and Gye, by the use of the high-speed centrifuge, of minute particles resembling those of other viruses. The nature of these particles was, moreover, confirmed by their reaction (agglutination with the blood serum of animals which had been injected with the sarcoma), in the same way that similar reactions have been de- monstrated with the elementary bodies from other virus diseases.
VIRUSES AS THE CAUSE OF DISEASE 169 The resemblance in structure and behaviour of the sarcoma of fowls to the malignant growths of mammals gives rise to hesitation before admitting that it is caused by an extrinsic virus, since mammalian malignant tumours have never been found to yield an infective cell-free extract and have been usually regarded as due to intrinsic tissue changes, though both mammalian and avian sarcomata can be induced by external physical and chemical irritants, such as tar and certain other substances. If, therefore, an extrinsic virus is one of the essential causes of fowl sarcoma, it must already be present in every susceptible fowl. The view that viruses which produce disease are not essentially invading parasites, but are produced by the host, is opposed by the regularity with which diverse viruses can be propagated in the same kind of animal, and by the fact that the same virus may infect several widely different species. For example, there are three distinct types of foot-and- mouth disease virus which produce apparently identical symptoms in animals and can only be distinguished by the fact that any one does not protect an animal against infection with the other two ; nevertheless, each virus maintains its identity whether propagated in the cow, pig, guinea pig, rat or hedgehog. It is difficult to see how this could happen if the virus were produced by each species of mammal from its own tissues. Another filterable agent, in many respects resembling the virus of an animal disease, is the bacteriophage which was independently discovered by Twort and D'Herelle. The effect of a drop of a suspension of bacteriophage added to a young liquid culture of susceptible bacteria is that the latter are dissolved and a large amount of fresh phage is produced. The bacterium-free filtrate of the liquid culture may often be diluted ten million times and still the same effect be produced by a drop as by the original suspension. D'Herelle and many other bacteriologists believe that the phage is a living agent which infects young growing bacteria, multiplies in their interior, and is set free when the bacteria die and break up. Phage, though destroyed at a temperature of 70° to 75°C., as a rule survives at 60° to 65°C., when the bacteria with which it is associated are killed ; it also resists drying and is remarkably resistant to the action of alcohol, acetone and chloro- form. D'Herelle considers that all strains of phage are really one though differ- ent strains become adapted to different bacteria, but more probably many phages when first obtained are a mixture of distinct races, and most filtrates containing phage are in the first instance derived from sewage or faeces, containing a great variety of bacteria. Some strains of bacteria harbour a phage although apparently insusceptible to its destructive action. The activity is only manifested when a filterate is tested on another susceptible strain. Thus many bacterial cultures have been shown to produce phage, though the presence of phage is not apparent and may not even
170 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, II have been suspected. This phenomenon suggests the original production of the phage by an uninfected culture, but it may merely be another instance of an ap- parently normal organism ' carrying ' a parasite ; many parallel cases are known of animals and plants ' carrying ' infective agents whilst themselves unaffected. De Jong showed that cultures of certain sporing bacilli which produce a phage may still be ' lysogenic ' after being heated at 100°C. for five minutes, whereas the free phage is killed at 70°C. for five minutes. When the spores germinate the phage is again liberated. This experiment suggests that the phage is preserved by its inclusion in the resistant spore, and this evidence of its derivation from the germinating spore de novo is not conclusive. The chief reason for doubting the living nature of some phages and certain viruses is the very small size of their filterable particles which makes it very doutbful whether they can have a complex composition resembling that of other living things. Different strains of phage are very unequal in their filterability ; some have relatively large particles with a diameter about half those of vaccina, while others pass through very fine filters, like the virus of foot-and-mouth disease, for which the diameter is estimated at about one tenth of the coarser phages. The uniform and carefully graded collodion membranes introduced by Elford, of which the average pore diameter can be calculated, enables much closer estimates to be made than formerly of the size of particles which just pass or are just withheld. The size of the particles of some viruses has also been calculated, especially by Bechhold, by their rate of deposition when centrifuged at 10,000VIRUSES AS THE CAUSE OF DISEASE 171 The exact and quantitative experiments with filters have been made possible by the high concentration in which certain viruses occur, and by opportunities for determining the presence of the virus in different dilutions by inoculation of susceptible small animals. The dilution of some fluids containing virus from the animal body can be carried to 1 in 106 or even higher when dealing with foot-and- mouth disease, vaccina and some other diseases without depriving them of infec- tivity. The quandary arising from the very active and apparently vital functions of virus particles in spite of their small size raises the question whether the accepted definitions of life are universally applicable or whether some intermediate state between what is called living and dead matter may not exist, as has been suggested by Boycott. Of the functions usually postulated for a living organism, assimilation appears to be the most characteristic and indispensable. It is reasonable to assume that the metabolism of an organism would be much simplified if it existed in a circulat- ing medium which provided a constantly changing supply of materials resembling its own components, such as might be afforded for an obligatory parasite living inside the cells of its host. Such an existence would have very different require- ments from a truly independent life. Virus diseases are transmitted from one animal to another by very varied means. Some, like canine distemper and certain influenza-like diseases of man, by droplets in the breath, others like yellow and dengue fevers by the bites of insects, others like louping-ill of sheep by the bites of blood-sucking ticks or of mites ; again, the bite of the mammalian host is the usual mode of infection with rabies, but for many others the method of transmission is still uncertain. In these res- pects they do not differ from diseases due to bacteria. It is characteristic of many diseases that, although the initial infection is caused by a virus, many of the symptoms and complications are due to secondary infec- tions with bacteria, and this is notably the case in the influenza-like group in man in swine fever, canine distemper and swine influenza. A virus may become remarkably adapted and sometimes permanently attenuated, when transferred to a new host, as is well instanced in the change of the virus of small-pox to vaccinia in cattle and rabbits, and of the rabies virus in the rabbit. The period of resistance shown by the host following an attack of disease is sometimes very prolonged even life-long after small-pox, varicella, yellow fever and canine distemper, but in some other cases the protection afforded is of com- paratively short duration, in foot-and-mouth disease usually for one to two years, whereas frequently recurring attacks due to the virus of herpes labialis are common.
172 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, II This immunity is to a great extent due to the production in the animal body of ' antibodies' which can be found in the blood serum of recovered animals just as occurs after bacterial infection. These antibodies can often be demons- trated by the formation of a precipitate or by the agglutination of the virus parti- cles when a suspension of the elementary bodies is mixed with the serum, or by the neutralisation of the virus by the serum when both are injected into an animal. These phenomena are of the same kind as the precipitation occurring when the blood serum of an animal which has been inoculated with a foreign protein (antigen) is mixed with the same protein in vitro, and are not peculiar to true infection. It is not intended here to do more than refer to the enormous and increasing number of filterable viruses known to cause infective disease in plants and found in their juices. These, like mosaic disease of tobacco, spotted wilt of tomato and crinkle and leaf-roll of potato may cause very serious disease, or in other cases may be present throughout the plant without producing any visible effect, as in some infections of the potato. There is good evidence that two viruses may co-exist in the same plant, and as a result the symptoms may be either much more or much less severe than when either virus is present alone. Some viruses are transmitted by insects such as aphis or thrips, while others pass by unknown means. In some of these diseases of plants peculiar ' inclusion bodies' are found in certain cells, but their relation to the virus is undetermined. It is known that these ' bodies ' as well as some of the symptoms due to a virus can in special cases be imitated by the addition of certain inorganic salts to the soil, but the disease is not then transmissible. Some plant viruses are highly resistant to drying chemical action and alcohol, and in many ways the viruses of plants resemble those of animals. The problems which the behaviour and properties of viruses raise are of great practical and theoretical interest, and are by no means yet solved.
INHERITANCE AS A FACTOR IN POULTRY DISEASE* BY W. V. LAMBERT, Iowa State College, Ames. [Reprinted from the Poultry Science May, 1935, Vol. XIV, No. 3.] (Presented at Annual Meeting, August 7-10, 1934.) During the past three decades the poultry industry in the United States has undergone tremendous changes. From the family flock basis, where birds were kept principally as a source of meat and eggs, it has gradually changed until today poultry keeping in its various aspects is the primary enterprise of thousands of farmers. With this change many problems that were not of great concern in the family flock have developed. Of first rank among these problems is that of flock mortality, which instead of being on the wane seemingly is becoming a more serious menace year by year. SIGNIFICANCE OF DISEASE LOSS The seriousness of mortality in commercial flocks has been emphasized in economic studies of poultry farming in various states. In New Jersey in 1915-16 the mortality was 7 per cent [App et al., 1919]; in Oregon in 1926-28 the average mortality was 13 per cent [Scudder et al., 1931]; 16.9 per cent in New Hampshire in 1929-30 [Woodworth and Reed, 1932]; 21 per cent in Utah 1929-30 [Thomas and Clawson, 1931 ]; 27 per cent in New York in 1930-31 [Misner, 1931]; and 21 per cent. in Iowa in 1933 [Vernon and Whitfield, 1933]. In egg-laying contests mortality has been equally severe. Stafseth and Weisner [1931] observed 18.98 per cent mortality among 10,000 pullets in eight successive years at the Michigan contest. Furthermore, they point out that poultry diseases are increasing and that the losses during the later years of the contest were greater than in the earlier years. In the Vineland egg-laying contest Black [1933] reports mortality rates of 24.51, 29.75 and 23.36 for the years 1929-30, 1930-31 and 1931-32, respectively. The seriousness of such losses to the industry cannot be over-emphasized. Ob- viously if the poultryman is to succeed he not only must raise good pullets but he must keep them alive. Lippincott and Card [1934] state that pullet mortality and, to a less extent mortality in older hens, is one of the most serious problems confronting poultrymen. Furthermore, they say that while good sanitary mea- sures have enabled flock owners to bring mortality in growing chicks reasonably well under control, that the problem of reducing or preventing mortality in laying stock is still to be solved. They believe that one of the most promising methods of * Journal Paper No. J231 of the Iowa Agr. Exp. Sta., Ames, project No. 251. (173)
174 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [ VI, II attack is the breeding and selection of resistant strains, though they point out that progress is likely to be slow until the vital significance of the problem is generally realized. Flock mortality is due, obviously, to diseases of various types and any pro- gramme for disease control must recognize and take into consideration the different kinds of diseases responsible for this mortality. METHODS OF CONTROL Three possible methods of disease prevention and control are available to poultrymen. The first, and perhaps the foremost in importance, is proper hygiene and sanitation for the flock. A second method is through the use of various therapeutic agents and the third method is genetic. The genetic or breeding method is concerned with the development of strains free from defects and disturbances of function, and, likewise, with the creation of strains having a high natural resistance to parasites and other infectious agents. The genetic method of disease control, therefore, implies two rather distinct categories of disease, namely the non-infectious or those diseases due to derange- ments of structure or function, and the infectious. It is the purpose of the writer to review the present status of our knowledge of the genetic aspects of disease and this review will be presented under the above general headings. Certain diseases, such as neurolymphomatosis, the etiology of which is still undetermined, will be considered separately. THE NON-INFECTIOUS DISEASES Non-infectious disturbances involving deviations from the normal or desir- able type in structure and function have been shown to be hereditary in many cases, and it is probable that most diseases of this sort will be shown to have some hereditary basis. Examples of such inherited defects in poultry are the creeper fowl [Landauer and Dunn, 1930], congenital loco [Knowlton, 1929], con- genital palsy [Hutt, 1934], dwarfism [Mayhew and Upp, 1932], and stickiness [Byerly and Jull, 1932]. Since many of these conditions are lethal or else produce some other serious detrimental effect in the affected individual they are responsible for reduction in reproductive efficiency and a corresponding economic loss. Hence it is essential for the welfare of the poultry industry to prevent the wide-spread dissemination of such genes through the population. The eradication of such diseases is purely a genetic problem, and any intelligent plan for disease control in the poultry industry certainlv must consider the breeding programme if such defects are to be eliminated. While clear-cut genetic evidence is lacking, it is probable that numerous weaknesses of the reproductive system, which result in much pullet mortality, are hereditary. A study of the causes of mortality in any of the egg-laying con- tests will show that much mortality is due to such causes as prolapsis of the oviduct, rupture of the oviduct, and to other causes in which an infective agent
INHERITANCE AS A FACTOR IN POULTRY DISEASE 175 apparently is not involved. In their attempt to increase production many poul- trymen have neglected to take into consideration the inherent stamina of their birds, which seemingly is a very vital factor if high egg production is to be main- tained over long periods of time with little mortality. Dunnicliff [1914] has pointed out the importance of this factor in. his analysis of the Hawkesbury egg- laying contest. He says that some strains show much greater susceptibility to ovarian weaknesses than do others. In the Hawkesbury contest the competition committee, adopted the policy of awarding a special trophy to the pen laying the most eggs without the replacement of a bird. Some high producing pens went through three years without the replacement of a single bird. As a result of his analysis Dunnicliff concludes that breeding for constitution will have to be con- sidered much more closely than in the past, and he is hopeful that close atten- tion to the salient points of breeding will result in eventual solution of this most difficult problem. Kennard [1933] has demonstrated the importance of selection based upon the simple expedient of using hens as the progenitors of the pullets to be retained as layers. By this method he was able to bring about an appreciable decrease in pullet mortality, and he attributes a part of the increase in pullet mortality, observed generally by poultrymen to the practice of selecting their breeding stock from pullets. As a permanent solution of the problem of pullet mortality, he advocates careful breeding and selection, combined with a type of management that will insure that young birds reach maturity free of parasites and unexposed to diseases. While it would be rash to assume that most pullet mortality is due to hereditary weaknesses, sufficient evidence has been advanced in man and other animals [Pearl, 1928], as well as in poultry, to show that longevity and strong constitution are inborn traits of certain families and strains. It would seem inevitable, there- fore that any long-time plan of poultry improvement, if it is to be economically successful, must consider the elimination of defects and the selection of strong hardy strains as vital parts of its programme. Certainly the genetic method of control is a most important one for diseases of this sort. THE INFECTIOUS DISEASES An infectious disease, in contrast to the non-infectious, requires the co- operation of two agents, the host and the parasite for its expression. That heri- table differences in resistance to such diseases exist has long been known, but until the last ten years most of this evidence was statistical in nature, or was confined to the demonstration of species and racial differences. In the last decade, however, several investigators have shown that heritable difference in resistance to bacterial diseases are common within the species. In poultry, Roberts and Card [1926] have demonstrated the effectiveness of selective breeding upon resistance to pullorum disease, and Lambert [1932] has shown similar results for
176 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, II fowl typhoid. Five generations of such selective breeding decreased the mortality from fowl typhoid from 85 to 10 per cent. Roberts [1932] has recently reported that the resistance of the pullorum stock has been maintained for seven conse- cutive generations, the respective mortalities for the selected and unselected stocks being 35 and 73 per cent. Furthermore, both Roberts and Card [1926] and Lambert [1932] have shown that strain differences in resistance to both these diseases exist in unselected flocks. In other species, also, clear-cut demonstrations of the role of heredity in disease resistance have been shown. Schott [1932] and Webster [1933] were able to build up remarkable resistance to typhoid-like infections in mice, Irwin [1929] to the Danysz bacillus in the rat, and Manresa [1932] to infectious abortion in rabbits. Other demonstrations of the part of heredity in infectious disease have been made by Frateur [1924], the Hagedoorns [1920] and by Gowen and Schott [1933]. That a passive transfer of immunity was not responsible for the increased resistance in the selected stock has been amply demonstrated by Irwin [1929], Lambert and Knox [1932], Schott [1932] and Gowen and Schott [1933]. The resistance has been shown to be transmitted by the male as well as by the female. In addition, Lambert [1932] and Roberts and Card [1927] have pointed out that in stocks selected for resistance to fowl typhoid and pullorum disease, chicks hatching from the eggs of females who remain carriers of the pathogenic bacterium are neither more nor less resistant than chicks produced from the eggs of non- carrier females of these stocks. The hereditary basis of resistance and susceptibility to infectious diseases appears, from most of the results so far available, to be complex, probably being dependent upon multiple factors. This, obviously, complicates the problem of using the genetic method for producing commercially desirable lines of resistant birds. It must be remembered, however, that very little research has been done on this problem and that a blanket rejection of a method on the basis of difficulty of accomplishment is unjustified. Certainly poultry furnishes the greatest oppor- tunity for using the breeding method of any of our domestic animals of great economic importance. In poultry, large progenies are available and this permits of selection of large numbers and of elimination on a large scale. In addition, the cost of the individual animal is low, a factor which often makes the use of therapeutic agents, as costly vaccines, economically unjustifiable. The whole question of the use of the breeding method in the case of infectious diseases is one upon which more information is sadly needed. Cole [1932] has pointed out that the ease with which preventive and therapeutic measures can be applied has led to a neglect of any natural resistance present in our flocks, a method of control which would be more satisfactory if naturally resistant stocks can be developed.
INHERITANCE AS A FACTOR IN POULTRY DISEASE 177 As pointed out by Cole, if it proves impracticable to develop high resistance in commercial flocks by selection, the same general result might be attained by developing special resistant flocks in which most of the genes had been made homozygous by selection and inbreeding. Such flocks could furnish sires to com- mercial poultrymen to be used for top-crossing on their stock. Such a pro- gramme should raise the general level of resistance in flocks. As the general level of resistance rose the need for treatment and other protective measures would be correspondingly lessened. The present commercial set-up in poultry with the wide distribution of chicks through hatcheries should furnish ample opportunity for the development of such a programme. Of course, any attempt to develop disease-resistant lines should first be made for those diseases which cannot easily be brought under control by other means, or in which the seriousness of the disease would justify large efforts on all methods of control. DISEASES OF UNCERTAIN ETIOLOGY Neurolymphomatosis, the etiology of which is still undetermined, is un- doubtedly the disease of greatest economic importance in poultry, in which no preventive or curative therapeutic treatment has been found. It would seem from the studies of Biely and his co-workers [1932, 1933] that the breeding method may be the most important means for controlling this disease. They have demonstrated that the differences in incidence of paralysis in different groups and families of chickens are highly significant, and in the later report they suggest that the difference between resistance and susceptibility is possibly controlled by one pair of genes. While such a conclusion is somewhat hazardous in view of the difficulty of reproducing the disease, the results certainly point to the desir- ability for further research. The results of Kennard [1933] also suggest the probability of inherent differences in resistance, and of the importance of selection against paralysis in a flock. That strain differences in resistance occur is also recognized by pathologists who have given much attention to this disease [see Patterson et al, 1932]. DISCUSSION The examples cited in the foregoing pages clearly emphasize the potential importance of the hereditary factor in disease. While little of practical im- portance in the way of disease control has been accomplished by use of the genetic method, it need only be pointed out that little attempt has been made to use this method in a systematic way. Further experimentation is greatly needed, and it is unfortunate indeed that our laboratories of poultry research have so generally overlooked this problem. The incomplete success of present methods of disease control and the importance of the breeding method, at least for some types of disease, certainly justify its inclusion in the research programme of many institutions. What is badly needed is a concerted research programme which has I
178 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, II as its aim the collecting of information and statistics on all phases of disease, and in which all possible methods of disease control are given due consideration. Such a programme obviously, is too large for any one institution, but is it too much to hope that a co-ordinated programme can be evolved in which the workers of many institutions will co-operate in the solution of the problems presented by disease ? Certainly it would seem the industry is sadly in need of such a pro- gramme. Some possible steps that might be included in such a research programme to throw further light on the use of the genetic method in disease control are as follows: A determination of the value of breeding only from hens, namely second year and older birds, upon the basis of their pullet performance. Such hens not only should have survived the pullet year with a good production record and a clean bill of health, but they should come only from those families having the best records in these respects. A breeding programme based upon this policy should produce hardier and more disease-resistant progeny. The careful collection of disease statistics upon many strains of birds. Meagre studies indicate that marked differences in resistance to disease as well as in general stamina are strain characteristics. At present our information on this question is woefully inadequate.. Once desirable strains of birds are isolated, to test these strains in intercrosses with the aim of combining the desirable traits of both strains in a new strain or strains. Sufficient evidence is available to indicate that some crosses will produce first-generation hybrids of high merit, both in production and in general stamina. The development of inbred lines from the more desirable strains which can be used to furnish sires for topcrossing and as foundation stock for intercrosses. Such inbreds obviously should be free from undesirable defects and other physiolo- gical weaknesses. From the top crosses and intercrosses continual effort should be made to develop better inbreds. A revamping of the objectives of our laying contests and R. O. P. programmes with more emphasis on determining the inherent stamina of various strains, as well as high production and other desirable characteristics. Properly conducted laying contests should furnish a source of invaluable information on all phases of disease, and upon the inherent potentialities of many strains of birds. The number of such properly conducted tests should be increased. Many of these suggestions, obviously, are suitable only for long-time pro- grammes. However, the menace of disease to the success of the poultry industry, and the apparent increase in the incidence of disease, in spite of sanitation and the use of therapeutic measures, would indicate the need for the adoption of a long-range programme, inclusive in its scope and vigorous in its prosecution.

GULLICKSON,1 Divisions of Dairy Husbandary and Agricultural Biochemistry, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, Minnesota. [Reprinted from the Journal of Dairy Science, Vol. XVIII, No. 4, April, 1935.] The fact that a calf has a definite vitamin-D requirement and suffers from a deficiency of this factor in its ration has been demonstrated by the published work of Rupel, Bohstedt and Hart (1), Bechdel, Landsburg and Hill (2), Huffman (3), and by unpublished work of Gullickson (4) in which experimental "rickets" developed when vitamin-D was withheld and disappeared when this factor was added to the ration. Rupel, Bohstedt and Hart (1), and Bechdel, Landsburg and Hill (2) have reported an increased ash percentage in certain representative bones, and an improvement in the concentration of calcium and inorganic phos- phorus in the blood plasma following vitamin-D therapy of animals suffering from experimental " rickets," which gives indirect evidence of a beneficial effect of vita- min-D on the calcium and phosphorus retention, but studies to directly measure this relationship have not been made. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS Ten-day mineral balance trials were employed for directly measuring the calcium and phosphorus retention. The mineral retention of normal calves was obtained first to be used for comparative purposes. Young, growing calves were then placed on basal experimental rations relatively low in calcium and phos- phorus content, and deficient in vitamin-D. Prairie hay was used as roughage for one group, and beet pulp for the other. The concentrates included corn, corn gluten meal, oats, corn starch, and a little wheat bran. For some animals the basal rations were supplemented with calcium, as calcium carbonate, and/or phosphorus, as monobasic sodium phosphate, and /or vitamin-D, as viosterol (250 D), or sunshine. Balance trials were run periodically to follow any changes and to note the effect of the various experimental schedules on the calcium and phos- phorus retention of the calves. On all calves that developed a vitamin-D de- ficiency as indicated by a rachitic syndrome and a subnormal concentration of calcium and inorganic phosphorus in the blood plasma, particular attention was paid to obtain a balance trial while the calf was still eating well, but after the deficiency was well established. Vitamin-D was then added to the ration, and after the lapse of a reasonable length of time, another trial was run.

182 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, II Except when the experimental schedule required exposure to sunshine the animals were kept indoors in box stalls. A large indoor pen was available for additional exercise. Feeding was done individually and an accurate record kept of actual consumption. All feeds were analyzed for nutrient and calcium and phosphorus content before they were included in the ration. Weights and measure- ments of height at withers were taken periodically and the rations adjusted at 30-day intervals to furnish somewhat more than the nutrient requirements for growth given by the Minnesota Standard published by Eckles and Gullickson (5). The total calcium and inorganic phosphorus content of the blood plasma were determined from successive 3-day composite samples at least once every thirty days. Standard methods were followed in conducting the balance trials. In order to accommodate steers in the metabolism stall special equipment was designed,2 as shown in Plate VI. A heavy rubber funnel was made from a large automobile inner tube. The top was clamped between two tape-covered metal rings which were then bolted together and bent somewhat to conform to the contour of the animal's body. The funnel opening was held in place over the opening of the animal's sheath by straps around the body. A small-bore, heavy-walled rubber tubing connected to a stopcock cemented into the lower end of the funnel, served to conduct the urine to the collecting pan. The calcium and phosphorus analyses of the excreta and feedstuffs were carried out by the methods of Morris, Nelson, and Palmer (6). Vitamin-D assays using rats were made on the two lots of prairie hay and the beet pulp used in the calf-feeding work. The method followed was that given in U. S. P.

186 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, II The results obtained with E-169 and E-170, grade Holstein females, are also given in Table II. These animals were available from another experiment in which they had developed a rachitic syndrome on a low-calcium-low-phos- phorus ration under indoor conditions. E-169 had been growing vigorously throughout the summer after receiving a viosterol supplement with no further change in her experimental schedule. E-170 had shown slow but persistent im- provement after the addition of CaCO3 to her ration. Both animals were receiving prairie hay. The results from the first balance trial with each animal indicate that the viosterol was enabling E-169 to retain adequate amounts of calcium and phosphorus from her limited intake, and that E-170 was retaining adequate amounts by virtue of the increased calcium intake without additional vitamin-D. The viosterol was now removed from the ration of E-169 and added to that of E-170 at the rate of 5 cc. daily. After seventeen days, balance trials were again run. E-169 was still retaining approximately the same amount of calcium and phosphorus. The added viosterol had not improved the mineral retention of E-170, in fact, it was somewhat less but still within the limits of variations re- ported for normal animals. The results of the balance trials run on this group of calves receiving hay as roughage are essentially normal in all cases. None of the calves showed the characteristic symptoms of a vitamin-D deficiency. As E-180 and E-183 were on the basal schedule without additional vitamin-D for six to seven months it would seem that a reasonable length of time had elapsed in which to deplete the possible vitamin-D stores of a young calf at weaning time, hence it seemed more likely that all the animals were getting this factor from some other source. In view of the fact that several investigators have found a varying, yet appreciable, amount of vitamin-D in different kinds of hay, it seemed that the prairie hay was the most likely source of an appreciable amount of this factor in the experi- mental schedule of the control calves on the basal ration. To check this point with approved methods, the prairie hays and beet pulp used as roughage were subjected to vitamin-D assays by use of laboratory animals. Both lots of prairie hay were found to carry appreciable amounts of vitamin-D which affords a logical explanation for the essentially normal condition and normal mineral retentions of the calves on the basal ration and the lack of any appreciable differences in the retentions of those getting varying amounts of vitamin-D supplements from different sources. The vitamin-D assays with laboratory animals were designed to be qualitative rather than quantitative. Preliminary tests indicated that rats would readily consume the test diets containing 45 per cent of powdered prairie hay and 25 per cent of beet pulp which corresponded to the levels of these materials in the calf rations. The calcium/phosphorus ratio of the rachitogenic diet was changed but slightly when the test materials were added, the tendency being for a wider ratio.

The improvement in calcium retention from 1.44 grms. to 6.82 grms. daily was nearly five-fold, while the increase in phosphorus reten- tion from 1.10 grms. to 2.68 grms. daily was slightly less than three fold. Shortly after the completion of this second trial observations indicated that the animal was apparently normal, whereupon the viosterol was removed from the ration, the experimental schedule otherwise being continued as before. There was a steady decline in the blood plasma calcium from 10.15 to 6.12 mgm. per 100 cc. and in inorganic phosphorus from 8.26 to 5.05 mgm., during the next three and one-half months, at which time the other rachitic-like symptoms began to appear. These observations indicated that body stores of vitamin-D, and/or calcium and phosphorus had been depleted and the animal was again in a vitamin-D deficient condition. At this time a third balance trial was run, followed by a fourth about five weeks after the ration had been again supplemented with 5 cc. of viosterol. As noted in Table IV, the increase in calcium and phosphorus retention was even more striking than before and serves to indicate the important role played by vitamin-D in promoting the mineral retention of vitamin-D deficient calves.

E-185 and E-194 developed a severe rachitic- like condition on a ration of beet pulp and grain mixture furnishing a very limited calcium intake. A slight-temporary improvement in the blood plasma calcium resulted when a CaCO3 supplement was added to bring the intake of E-185 to 40 grms. daily and E-194 to 50 grms. daily. By the end of a month it was declining again and the physical condition was very poor. E-185 was showing considerable anorexia, and E-194 was also slightly off feed so that the mineral intake indicated in the balance trials run at this time is somewhat lower than the prescribed amounts previously consumed. The results are shown in Table IV as the first balance trial for each animal, respectively. The inability of vitamin-D deficient calves to make normal mineral retention on rations supplying an abundance of calcium and normal phosphorus is indicated by the fact that E-185 was in negative calcium and phosphorus balance while E-194 was slightly better than in equili- brium. A second balance trial was run on each animal after the ration had been supplemented for some time with viosterol. Under the influence of the added vitamin-D both animals now showed very satisfactory positive balances of both calcium and phosphorus, as may be noted in the second trial for each animal as recorded in Table IV. Although the appetites were now good, the nutrient and mineral intake of E-185 was held down to the same amount that she consumed on the previous trial, but for unavoidable reasons the mineral intake, especially the calcium, was some- what larger for E-194 in the second trial than in the first. However, the calcium intake of E-194 was liberal, and more than sufficient in both trials so that the variation undoubtedly does not introduce any appreciable difficulty in inter- preting the results. The increase in the calcium intake was approximately 100 grms. for the 10-day period, while the increase in retention was about 102 grms. The tendency is for the percentage of mineral retention to decrease with an in- crease in the intake, but even by assuming that the retention of the extra 100 grms. of calcium in the second trial would have been at the same rate as in the first trial there would have been an increase of only about 5.81 grms. in the second trial without the added vitamin-D. The fact that over 100 grms. of extra calcium were retained in the second trial indicates clearly the beneficial effect of the added vitamin-D. The results secured with E-185 and E-194 substantiated the observations already made on E-201 and indicate that a liberal calcium intake will not suffice to promote adequate mineral retention in calves suffering from a vitamin-D deficiency.

The animal became worse rapidly and went off feed so badly that a satisfactory balance trial to indicate the effect of added phosphorus was not obtained. The results of the trial are shown in Table V. The fact that a severe breakdown seemed to be hastened would indicate that the effect undoubtedly was not very favourable. The phosphorus supplement was now removed from her ration and viosterol added. As the animal was nearing recovery a third balance trial was run with the ration, adjusted to duplicate that of the first trial except for the added viosterol. The results given in Table V show a considerable improvement in both the calcium and phosphorus retention over that obtained when the animal was mildly deficient in vitamin-D and thus substantiate the previous observations as to the favourable effect of vitamin-D. DISCUSSION The favourable effect of vitamin-D on the calcium and phosphorus retention of calves suffering from a vitamin-D deficiency is strikingly shown by the results obtained with E-201, E-185, and E-194. The vitamin-D deficiency of these animals was indicated by sub-normal concentrations of calcium and inorganic phosphorus in the blood plasma, stiffness, bending of the knees, swelling of the knee, hock and pastern joints, humping of the back, and often some inanition. As shown in Table VI, the average daily retention of these calves at an age when bone mineralization should have been progressing rapidly was only 0.51 grms. of calcium and 0.24 grms. of phosphorus. When viosterol was added to supply vitamin-D, and without any other appreciable change in the ration, there was a marked increase in the calcium and phosphorus retention in every case, the daily average now being 7.49 grms. of calcium and 2.68 grms. of phosphorus. These amounts represent essentially normal retentions. The increase brought about by the vitamin-D administration in from three to seven weeks was approximately fourteen-fold for calcium and eleven-fold for phosphorus. Coincident with the marked improvement in the mineral retention there was a prompt return of the calcium and inorganic phosphorus of the blood plasma to normal concentrations, and a corresponding improvement in the physical well-being of the calf. With such decided and consistent results there can be no doubt of the important role played by vitamin-D in promoting the retention and utilization of calcium and phosphorus by calves under these conditions.

RELATION OF VITAMIN-D TO CALCIUM AND PHOSPHORUS RETENTION IN CATTLE 195 The average normal daily retention of 6.42 grms. of calcium and 3.22 grms. of phosphorus obtained in this work is almost exactly in a two to one ratio irres- pective of the varying amounts in the ration fed. This closely approximates the ratio of these two elements in the bodies of growing and mature cattle. Lindsey, Archibald, and Nelson (7) noted the same relationship in their work with normal animals. It is of interest to note that in this work the slight average daily posi- tive balances of 0.51 grms. of calcium and 0.24 grms. of phosphorus shown by the rachitic calves are also in an approximately two to one ratio. Also, that the loss of calcium and phosphorus in the case of E-185 showed this ratio. Such observations indicate an ultimate interdependence between the two elements and suggest that a deficiency in one might be responsible for a lack of retention of the other. The fact that the calves receiving prairie hay as roughage continued through- out the experiment in an apparently normal condition irrespective of whether or not they received any vitamin -D supplement, whereas those on a similar or even higher mineral intake but receiving beet pulp soon showed symptoms of a vitamin-D deficiency, indicates that the prairie hay undoubtedly carried an ade- quate amount of the antirachitic factor, while the beet pulp contributed very little, if any. The vitamin-D assays with laboratory animals furnished corro- borative and conclusive evidence on the above points. When the two lots of prairie hay were fed to rachitic rats definite healing was obtained, although it was more pronounced for one lot than for the other. No signs of healing were evidenced when the beet pulp was fed. The assays furnish a basis for estimating the amount of vitamin D supplied the calves by the hay contained in their rations. Rough calculations indicate that the average hay allowance supplied the calves with approximately 135 Steen- bock units of vitamin-D daily, which served to protect the calves from developing the rachitic-like syndrome on the level of mineral intake furnished by these rations. Just how much less may have sufficed to protect the animals cannot be deter- mined from these observations. These estimation indicate that the vitamin-D requirement of this species is relatively small as compared with the requirement of infants as recently reported by Hess and Lewis (8), while the fact that an in- creased mineral intake and changes in the calcium/phosphorus ratio failed to protect the calves or initiate appreciable healing suggests the possibility that calves are less independent of vitamin-D than the rat. Some suggestions as to the amount and length of storage of vitamin-D by calves are also indicated by the results obtained. The viosterol fed to the calves as a therapeutic agent supplied roughly 15,000 Steenbock units daily, which is over 100 times the amount furnished by the hay. The exact amount which would have proved sufficient is not known but if the vitamin-D in the viosterol had been used efficiently and the excess stored, the animals should have accumulated
196 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, II sufficient for protection for a comparatively long period of time. When the viosterol was removed from the ration of E-201 after the second balance trial the previous stores of vitamin-D made during two and one-half months of viosterol feeding were depleted in about three and one-half months, as evidenced by his physical condition and the low concentration of calcium and inorganic phosphorus in the blood plasma. The time interval would undoubtedly have been shortened had the two pounds of prairie hay allowed part of the time been replaced with beet pulp all of the time. These observations suggest several possibilities. For instance, the Vitamin-D in irradiated ergosterol may not be the most effective for this species so that the excess available for storage was small, or it may be inefficiently absorbed, or if absorbed, it may be re-excreted. It is also possible that the calf has only limited ability for storing vitamin-D at best. The observa- tions on these points are very meagre and the possibilities mentioned are made merely as suggestions. The results do indicate, however, that a young growing calf may make a storage of vitamin-D under favourable circumstances which may be used as a. protection against a deficiency of this factor for a varying length of time under adverse conditions. CONCLUSIONS The following conclusions may be drawn from the results of this investiga- tion. 1. The calcium and phosphorus retention of vitamin-D deficient calves is very markedly improved by the administration of vitamin-D. The average calcium retention may be increased fourteen-fold and the phosphorus retention eleven-fold by vitamin-D therapy. 2. Increasing the mineral content of the ration of vitamin-D deficient calves has no favourable influence on the mineral retention. 3. Based on the limited evidence obtained, the average daily retention of normal calves approximated 6.50 grms. of calcium and 3. 25 grms. of phosphorus. 4. Judging from the results of this experiment, calcium and phosphorus are retained by normal calves in approximately a two to one ratio regardless of varia- tions in the mineral content of the ration. The statement is equally true for the small average daily retentions made by calves suffering from a vitamin-D deficiency. These observations indicate an ultimate inter-relationship between these two elements and suggest that a shortage of either one in the ration might act as a limiting factor in the retention of the other. 5. Prairie hay may carry appreciable amounts of vitamin-D. Beet pulp, on the other hand, probably possesses very little, if any, anti-rachitic potency. 6. A young growing calf may store vitamin-D under favourable conditions to be used as a protection against a deficiency of this factor for a varying length of time under adverse conditions.

BALANCED DIETS, NET ENERGY VALUES AND SPECIFIC DYNAMIC EFFECTS BY H. H. MITCHEL, Division of Animal Nutrition, University of Illinois, U. S. A. [Reprinted from Science, Vol. 80, December 14, 1934, pp. 558BALANCED DIETS 199 any other measurement (such as blood hemoglobin) that may be pertinent to the problem at hand, and the pair mates are then fed the same amount of the two rations to be compared, one to one animal and one to the other. Under these conditions the better balanced of the two rations will promote the more rapid growth, or in other ways induce a better nutritive condition, for example with reference to the blood or the bones ; and conversely every improvement in a diet with respect to its power to promote growth and nutritive condition is prima facie evidence of a betterment in its balance. The reality of this conclusion seems obvious, and no precise definition of balance in diet on any other basis has been proposed in so far as the writer is aware. In fact, a search of current writings and text-books has failed to reveal that the conception of nutritive balance in diets or rations has received much intensive thought. On the evidential side, the con- clusion is supported by the results of numerous paired-feeding experiments, which have demonstrated the possibility of distinguishing on this basis better from poorer balanced diets with respect to protein, vitamins, sugars and inorganic salts. Of the balanced ration, it may be said that the more of it is consumed, the better nourished will be the animal with reference to which the ration is balanced, up to the point of repletion of its requirements. It is an attractive hypothesis concerning unbalanced rations that the more of them are consumed the poorer nourished will be the animal with reference to the functions with respect to which the rations are unbalanced. To the writer the hypothesis has much rational appeal and it receives factual support from some experiments performed in the nutrition laboratory at the University of Illinois. Thus, young growing rats subsisting on a diet of milk will develop anemia, because milk is unbalanced with respect to the requirements of the hematopoietic tissues; and furthermore the more milk the animals consume daily, the more rapidly will the anemic condition develop, although in all other respects the animals are well nourished. Again, young rats placed upon a diet high in calcium, low in phosphorus and deficient in vitamin D will develop rickets, and the rate of development of this bone disease is the greater, the greater the daily consumption of the rachitogenic diet. Of much the same significance is the fact that young pigs placed upon a protein-deficient diet will grow slowly, but with increasng intakes of food will become increasingly fat, re- presenting a misdirected or uncoordinated growth. Probably further illustrations of the hypothesis that unbalanced rations, like toxic substances, exert harmful effects in proportion to the amounts consumed, will be forthcoming when it is subjected, to systematic and quantitative study. The quite general failure of animals to consume unbalanced rations as avidly as balanced rations is under- standable if the former may be considered physiologically harmful. Some of the implications of the above conceptions of nutritive balance in diet are interesting and of importance to the science of nutrition. Attention will be restricted to the question of the utilization of the chemical energy contained in a diet, representing a nutritive summation of all the organic nutrients.
200 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI , II There is current in animal nutrition a method of assessing the energy value of rations that is far in advance of any method used in human nutrition. According to this method, introduced by Armsby some thirty years ago, the final value of a ration as a source of energy in metabolism is obtained by deducting from its gross energy (heat of combustion) all the losses of energy incident to its utilization. The metabolizable energy is the gross energy minus indigestible energy (gross energy of faeces and intestinal gases) and unoxidized energy (gross energy of urine). The final, or net energy value is equal to the metabolizable energy minus the increase in the heat production incident to the consumption and utilization of the ration. This latter increment consists largely (in farm animals) or entirely (in humans) of the " specific dynamic effect " of food. The net energy of a unit weight of a ration, expressed as a percentage of the contained metabolizable energy, measures the net availability of the latter. With these definitions in mind, the first implication of the above defined conception of nutritive balance in a ration or diet is that, except for differences in digestibility, the net energy value of all perfectly balanced rations is the same under the same conditions of feeding, or, somewhat more precisely, the net availability of the metabolizable energy of all perfectly balanced rations is maximal for any imposed conditions of feeding. When the net energy conception was developed by Armsby, it was his idea that each food material had its own fixed characteristic net energy value and that the net energy value of a ration was the weighted mean of the net energy values of the constituent foods. All his investigations at Penn- sylvania State College were based upon this simple hypothesis, which was not inconsistent with any of the theories of energy utilization prevalent at that time. Forbes and his associates have been impelled to depart from this hypothesis of Armsby, first, because of experimental evidence to the effect that the net energy value of a ration or feed is not constant, but depends upon the conditions of feed- ing and second, because other evidence indicated that the net energy value of a ration bore no simple relation to the net energy value of the costituent foods. However, Forbes' recently announced "law of maximum normal nutritive value,"2 although it advocates the use of completely balanced rations in determinations of net energy values, does not state nor imply that the net availability of the meta- bolizable energy of such rations will be maximal and identical. In fact, the state- ment that " an individual foodstuff expresses its normal and most characteristic nutritive value......only as it is a part of a ration which is qualitatively com- plete and quantitatively sufficient .. " seems opposed to this deduction, which, if true, would lead one to suppose that the most characteristic nutritive value of a food would be observed only when it is fed alone. When properly balanced with other foods, its distinctive nutritive properties would be entirely submerged in a resultant optimal combination that would be no better nor worse than that of many other 2 Science. 77 : 306, 1933.
BALANCED DIETS 201 possible mixtures of foods. The recent developments in the net energy conception, initiated and defended by the Pennsylvania group have tended to complicate the problem of net energy determinations and perhaps even to discourage those who have hoped to put the conception to practical use in the rationing of farm animals. But if all perfectly balanced rations exhibit the same net energy value (except for differences in digestibility) under the same conditions of feeding, then the problem is greatly simplified and the plan of its solution is clear ; furthermore, the proba- bility that the solution will be sufficiently simple to possess great practical value is enhanced. A second important implication from the conception of a balanced diet developed above is that the specific dynamic effects of the various nutrients are not characteristic values except when they are fed to animals singly. When the nutrients are fed in combinations, the specific dynamic effects of the mixtures will be less than the weighted mean of the individual effects, and this decrease will continue as the combinations approach a perfectly balanced combination for the animal under experiment, of which the heating effect will be minimal. In this discussion, the term " specific dynamic effect " will be applied to the total excess heat developed by a given food or nutrient, and not the so-called "peak" effect, which possesses an extremely limited significance. This is a decidedly heretical deduction. It is, however, a direct corollary of the preceding implication, since if the net availabilities of the metabolizable energy of all perfectly balanced rations are maximal and identical, then their specific dynamic effects must be minimal and identical. Current theories attach definite heating effects to proteins, sugars, starches, fats, and even the various naturally occurring amino-acids, and teach that com- bination of these nutrients does not modify appreciably their characteristic effects as metabolic stimulants, but these theories fail to account for many facts in the science of nutrition. Eight years ago Carman and the author3 showed that the mere inclusion of 1 per cent of sodium chloride in a ration predominantly made up of corn increased its growth-promoting value by from 40 to 50 per cent in paired- feeding experiments with rats and chicks, without appreciably affecting its digesti- bility. Assuming reasonably that this effect could not have been the result of a depression of the basal metabolism or of the muscular activity of the experimental animals, it must have been an expression of a great increase in the net energy value of the ration and as great a depression in its specific dynamic effect. As we said at the time : "The growth data of this experiment afford a striking illustration of the fact that the utilization of food energy by growing animals may be greatly impaired by an improper balance among indispensable dietary factors ". None of the current theories of the cause of the specific dynamic effect of food would seemingly account for this phenomenon. 3 Jour. Biol. Chem., 68 : 165, 1926. M
202 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, II Protein ingested alone by animals causes a marked specific dynamic effect, much greater than any other nutrient, but when incorporated into a protein-free diet, otherwise complete, it must decrease the specific dynamic effect of such a diet rather than increase it, because the combination will be more efficient in maintaining the energy balance of an adult animal or in increasing the energy balance of a growing animal. Weiss and Rapport 4 were greatly mystified when they found that calorigenic amino-acids, administered to dogs along with proteins, failed to increase the calorigenic action of the latter. But equally mystifying from the standpoint of the current theories of the specific dynamic effects of food is the action of amino-acids in improving greatly the efficiency for growth of rations containing protein complexes deficient in those amino-acids 5. In all probability this increase in efficiency means a decrease in the specific dynamic effect, assuming again that the basal metabolic rate and the activity of the experimental animals was not depressed by the amino-acid supplements. Apparently the specific dynamic effects of isolated nutrients fed as such have very little if anything to do with the specific dynamic effects of mixtures of nutrients, particularly balanced mixtures. Without being able to specify the exact causes of the metabolic stimulation induced by the consumption of food, we may nevertheless conclude reasonably that its intensity is dependent primarily upon the degree of accumulation of the end-products of digestion within the tissues, which is in turn dependent for any given intake of food upon the rate of utilization of these products by the tissues. Their rate of utilization will be determined by the proportions existing among them, such that the better the balance with reference to the requirements of the animal the more rapid the rate of utilization and withdrawal from the cellular fluids. The metabolic stimulation thus occurs only when there is an excess of nutritive material in the tissues, and is to a considerable extent proportional to this excess. It is possibly a mechanism operating merely for the removal of excess food material from the body cells in the interests of physiological efficiency. These speculations are now being investigated experimentally in the Division of Animal Nutrition of the University of Illinois. 4 Jour. Biol. Chem., 60 : 513, 1924. 5 H. H. Mitchell and D. B.

The packs of sheep taken from one side to the other for grazing on the Danubian islands in consequence of the desiccated condition of the pastures on the two banks, the contraband of sheep transported by boats and the carcases thrown into the river constituted the probable mode of penetration of sheep-pox from Rumania into Bulgaria. As to foot-and-mouth disease, the author emphasizes the view previously expressed that the appearance of the disease in a Balkanic country is generally followed by its spread along the whole of the peninsula. Specific instances are cited to illustrate this. Some data are produced to show that, prior to 1924, glanders principally existed in the districts adjoining Dobroudja and Thrace and also amongst the horses of certain Rumanian nomads. From the available epizootiological data concerning dourine, it would appear that the disease for the first time was encountered in Bulgaria in a stallion imported from Hungary in 1898. The author states that cases of dourine are chiefly noticed in the neighbouring frontier zone of Dobroudja amongst young mares, which constitute the agency through which the disease is imported into Bulgaria. From the foregoing, one may formulate the two deductions that (1) for prophylaxis against certain epizootics, which especially concern the Balkan Peninsula, an inter - Balkanic arrangement is indicated [similar arrangements may be found desirable in other parts of the world] and (2) the danger of the passage of epizootics exists in- dependently of the activity or of the suppression of international traffic. A case in point was the appearance of sheep-pox and foot-and-mouth disease in the districts of Trn. in spite of the fact that the frontier between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia was entirely closed by means of barbed wire netting. The author refers to the Franco-Swiss and Franco-Belgian Arrangements and to the Franco-Italian and Franco German Conventions regulating frontier traffic and the movement of animals for pasturage. The question of frontier protection against epizootics is also frequently dealt with in the Veterinary Commercial Conventions of which it constitutes an integral part, as the Conventions between Rumania and Czechoslovakia [1930], between Yugoslavia and Greece [1927] and between Bulgaria and Turkey [1933]. A comparison of these Arrangements and Conventions shows that, independently of the differences imposed by the conditions peculiar to the contracting countries, they stipulate almost wholly the same rules. Thus, the ententes relative to the pasturage for horses provide for (1) the identification of animals and their brand-marks ; (2) a certificate of health delivered by the mayor testifying that the animals concerned come from a locality free from a given epizootic ; (3) the passage of veterinary authorities across the frontier for the purpose of visiting the animals ; (4) the adoption of combative measures. The seasonal movements of animals, however, relate to the realm of importation, and in the Convention regulating such traffic the following rules are chiefly stipulated : (1) the identification of the proprietaries concerned ; (2) the compulsory presenta- tion of a descriptive statement for the identification of beasts of burden or of draught
208 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, II animals ; (3) a certificate of health and of place of origin ; (4) regular and frequent visits to the animals ; (5) the establishment of a frontier zone, ordinarily of a depth of 15 to 20 kilometres, on both sides of the frontier line ; (6) the obligation of veterinary authorities to communicate mutually, within 24 hours, whenever any disease makes its appearance ; (7) the reciprocation of information concerning the preventive measures applied and the eventual extension of the frontier zone on the appearance of a particularly menacing epizootic. The establishment of a frontier veterinary zone is necessitated by our knowledge of the epizootics, namely, that direct contact is not the only method of pro- pagation of contagious diseases, but that there are other methods to which the frontier line does not always constitute a barrier. It would thus seem desirable to substitute the notion of " frontier zone " for that of " frontier line " and constitute for it a new mode of sani ary control, whilst the feudal spirit which expresses itself in the two opposing manifestations, namely, the authorities of the custom house and contraband, should make room for sanitary collaboration. The establishment of a frontier veterinary zone alone, however, is not calculated to solve the problem of sanitary protection, and the author stresses the desirability of the unification of veterinary organizations and, particularly, the methods of combating epizootics and suggests the institution of a frontier veterinary service in which each agent will have a special sector in his charge. While the unification of combative measures against all diseases, without exception, is not possible, it is nevertheless feasible, under a European plan, to unify the zoo- prophylactic measures against rabies, sheep-pox, dourine, rinderpest, rouget, anthrax, blackquarter and cholera of birds. The author deprecates merely formal collaboration amongst veterinary authorities and refers to the need of creating an intimate liaison amongst them designed to ensure concerted action in the application of combative measures against epizootics.

The authors summarise the results of recent investigations carried out by the United States Department of Agriculture on the sources of certain unpalatable flavours in milk. The unpalatable flavours maybe brought about by feed by auto-oxidation of milk fat hastened by certain metals, by high temperature, by sunlight, by absorption of odours of some fruits, vegetables, chemicals or by rancidity caused by the enzyme lipase which splits fats into fatty acids having characteristic odours. The natural flavour of milk may be protected by adjustment of the feed programme, so that animals do not have an access to feeds like, clover, corn silage, turnips, legume silage, etc., five hours before milking211 CORRESPONDENCE THE EDITORIAL COMMITTEE, The Indian Journal of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry, DEAR SIRS, Since the publication of my article on Pyosepticaemia of Calves in the Sep- tember (1935) issue of The Indian Journal of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry, the organism which I described as a common cause of this disease has been serologically typed as Salmonella enterditis, var.dublin. This is an interesting finding, as it appears the first record in India of the existence of this organism as the cause of disease in calves. A similar disease of calves has been encountered within recent years in a number of countries.

NCAG214 PUBLICATIONS OF THE IMPERIAL COUNCIL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH, INDIA NCAGORIGINAL ARTICLES THE CURATIVE TREATMENT OF SURRA IN BOVINES BY S.K. SEN, M.Sc., F.R.E.S., Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar [Received for publication on 10th April 1936] (With Plate VII and three text figures) INTRODUCTION The present investigation originated out of an inquiry made by the Animal Health Division of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Common- wealth of Australia, concerning the possibility of importing into that country certain types of Indian cattle under a guarantee to be given by the veterinary authorities in India that they are free from surra. A very real responsibility was involved in advising upon a matter of this kind, in view of the risk of veterinary officers inadvertently tarnishing the fair name of India by certifying animals as being entirely free from this disease, when such was not actually the case. At the same time, the inquiry brought into prominence the almost entire lack of authen- tic information concerning a dependable method of rendering affected cattle free from surra. Bovine surra, both in India and other countries, has never appeared to be deserving of the same degree of attention as most other diseases of cattle, this being attributable to the fact that, except in the few instances where the disease has been observed to progress to a fatal issue [Mahajan, 1934; Iyer and Sarwar, 1935 ], its symptoms have, as a rule, been confined to a negligible and erratic elevation of the body temperature. As remarked by Sheather [ 1934 ], " Cattle and buffaloes very seldom come as subjects for treatment owing to the fact that they may be infected without showing symptoms ". Similarly, writing in 1921, Hornby went as far as to state : "I am aware of no literature which records recent outbreaks of surra among bovines, and this in spite of the wide dis- tribution of the disease among horses and camels in countries where cattle and buffaloes are numerous. Consequently there has been no need for any work to be done on the treatment." The remarkable resistance displayed by bovines to the development of the clinical symptoms of surra is strikingly illustrated by the fact that " specially selected cattle from India, in the best of condition, have been found to be the carriers of trypanosomes in their blood after they have travelled to America" [Hoare, 1913]. Similar instances are recorded by Joseph [ 1928 ], according to whom the presence of surra trypanosomes in the circulating blood of (215)
216 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III bovines is not necessarily associated with an elevation of body temperature. There would thus appear to be some reason for doubt as to whether the parasite responsible for surra in bovines is referable to the species Trypanosoma evansi at all, and although in a recent communication, Rao and Mudaliar [ 1934 ] have produced some experimental evidence to show that this is so, it would seem that the final solution of the problem will not have been arrived at until further light has been thrown on the precise identity of the species of trypanosome involved in the occasional cases of fatal or acute surra in cattle. Should the parasite con- cerned in cases of this kind actually turn out, as a result of intensive morpholo- gical studies, to be indistinguishable from T. evansi, then it would be of consider- able interest to ascertain the circumstances under which this parasite, which is usually innocuous for bovines, attains the status of a virulent variant for these animals. Unfortunately, an investigation into problems relative to bovine surra is ren- dered difficult by the fact that there is no reliable method for the diagnosis of the disease itself. A perusal of the available literature shows that practically all workers are agreed as to the difficulty of diagnosing the disease in ruminants, and repeated reference has been made by them to the futility of declaring a bovine sub- ject as free from surra from the mere fact that an examination of its blood smears has proved negative for the presence of surra parasites, for these may be so scanty that " microscopical examination of the blood carried out for long periods may fail to reveal the presence of trypanosomes " and even when the temperature is high " microscopical examination of the blood may fail " [ Sheather, 1934 ]. The diffi- culty of diagnosing bovine surra with certainty has also been referred to by Bakker [ 1925 ] in the Dutch East Indies, while Gaiger [ 1911 ], in India, even declared that " ordinary microscopic examination of the blood of cattle for T. evansi in India is useless, the parasites are so few in number that they have never been so seen ". Several workers have, therefore, mentioned the desirability of diagnosing surra in bovines by means of the so-called biological tests, that is, by the sub- inoculation of the suspected blood into small animals [Doeve, 1918; Hornby, 1921; Sheather, 1934], although Gaiger [1911] would even regard this method of diagnosis as "obviously impracticable" but feels "almost certain that given time, money, and opportunities for experiment, other means might be devised ". In referring to the impracticability of the biological test, Gaiger had presumably in mind the difficulty of conducting large-scale sub-inoculations under the condi- tions obtaining in the field when one has to deal with an actual epizootic of cattle surra. A reference may be made at this point to four other well-known methods that have been recommended from time to time for the diagnosis of surra, namely, Formol-gel [ Knowles, 1924, 1925] and the Mercuric Chloride [ Barnett & Kenny, 1928 ] tests and the method of diagnosis based upon the so-called Adhesion Pheno- menon [ Davis and Brown, 1927 ; Duke and Wallace, 1930 ]. Apart from the fact
CURATIVE TREATMENT OF SURRA IN BOVINES 217 that there is little evidence on record to show that any one of these can be utilized with success in the diagnosis of cattle surra, it still remains to be unequivocally established that the reactions obtained by these methods are not essentially group, as opposed to specific, reactions. The diagnostic value of Adhesion Phenomenon was repeatedly tested at Muktesar upon rats artificially infected with T. evansi, but the results were found difficult to interpret. As to the Complement Fixa- tion test, however, Randall [ 1934 ] records having employed this successfully in detecting the infection in suspected horses in the Philippines, where T. evansi is the only known pathogenic type of trypanosome218 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III of the drug in a 5 per cent solution and all the animals were kept in dark, fly-free stables. An unsatisfactory feature of these experiments, however, was that, except one animal, none showed trypanosomes in blood before treatment, diagnosis having been made from symptoms alone, and the author states that " the buffalo is a difficult animal to deal with ". Three Bengal oxen showing surra trypanosomes in their blood were also treated by him with the same drug and their blood remained negative for one month after a single injection of 5 grms. It is of interest that in the Annual Report of the Department of Agricul- ture, Java, 1922, Naganol is mentioned, as having yielded "encouraging results in acute surra in bovines". Lagas [ 1926 ], in Sumatra, treated 811 buffaloes " prophylactically" with Naganol, from October 1924 to April 1925. Sixty-four of these were healthy carriers, ninety-four showed clinical symptoms of the disease and forty-two showed the parasites in their circulating blood. During this period, forty-nine of the treated buffaloes died from various causes and nine showed trypanosomes in their blood, the intervals between appearances of the parasites ranging from 5 weeks to 10 months. Eight of the animals received a second dose of 2-4 grms. of Naganol and none of these relapsed " up to the present " (the article was pub- lished in April 1926). In a recent paper, Bakker [ 1932], in the Dutch East Indies, has recorded having successfully used Naganol in 5-grm. doses in the treatment of 130 adult buffaloes affected with surra. He also reports having obtained encouraging results in the treatment of surra in cattle with the same drug. A perusal of the available records of work carried out in India upon the treat- ment of bovine surra shows that some of the earliest attempts to cure the disease in this country were made by means of atoxyl and certain indigenous remedies [ Chetti, 1922 ; Rao, 1923 ], but these came to be gradually replaced by tartar eme- tic, which held the ground for some length of time and is in favour with certain workers even to this day. Concerning this drug, however, Edwards [ 1926 ], as a result of experiments carried out at Muktesar, observes that although a single injection of the drug at the rate of 5 c.c. of a 3.2 per cent solution per 100 lb. body weight frequently produces a recovery, it is known " that the parasites remain thereafter in a state of latent activity ". This conclusion has quite recently been confirmed by Sarwar [ 1936 ], who found that cattle treated for surra with tartar emetic continued to harbour the parasites, as determined by biological tests. On the other hand, Iyer and Sarwar [ 1935 ] obtained what would appear to be consistently satisfactory results in combating a natural outbreak of bovine surra in the Punjab, from the use of Naganol administered intravenously at the rate of 10 to 20 c.c. of a 10 per cent solution, depending upon the size of the animal concerned. Similar results had also been previously reported by Mahajan [1934 ]
Ind. Jour. Vety. Sci. & Anim. Husb. Vol. VI, Pt. III. PLATE VII [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 1.CURATIVE TREATMENT OF SURRA IN BOVINES 219 from Hyderabad-Deccan. As will be seen from what is stated in the following section, Naganol was also the drug used throughout the experiments described in the present paper. Rodenwaldt and Douwes [1922], however, would appear to discredit all reports of alleged " cures " in buffaloes and in other animals suffering from chronic surra infections, for according to these authors, such animals frequently show long remissions during which " the trypanosomes are so scanty in the blood that they may be undiscoverable ". They refer to the futility of studying the action of Naganol upon surra in isolated cases and stress the importance of carry- ing out large-scale experiments before any conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy of this drug for surra in buffaloes. It would seem that the final conclusion to be arrived at in regard to the pro- spects of obtaining cures in surra in the bovine subject by means of drug treatment will have to be based upon the results of a series of large-scale experiments, as sug- gested by Rodenwaldt and Douwes [ 1922 ], with due regard to the possibility that a proportion of the reported relapses in the past may have been, in reality, cases of re-infection contracted through the agency of insect vectors. As will be seen presently, this possibility was borne in mind when planning the present investigation. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the present investigation a total of fifteen animals, comprising six hill bulls and nine buffaloes, were employed. As will be explained later, two out of the nine buffaloes had been actually brought under experimentation long before the trials originating out of the Australian inquiry were commenced, while two buffaloes died and one buffalo had to be discarded and replaced by another during the progress of the investigation. Except for these six cases, the observation period in the case of all others, was about one year and a half. The experimental animals were housed in two especially-constructed fly- proof stables (Plate VII, fig. 1) in order to prevent them from contracting a natural infection through the agency of biting flies. At the entrance, the stables were provided with double-doors (Plate VII, fig. 2) designed to prevent any possibility of access of flies while the attendants are entering or leaving the premises. The windows and the ventilators were covered with wire-netting, while all outlets for the drainage of urine and stable washings were suitably screened or plugged up. It is almost needless to emphasize the importance of protective measures of this kind, for, as Musgrave and Clegg [ 1903 ] have remarked, " to obtain satisfactory results such a structure is an absolute necessity ". The strain of T. evansi used in these trials had been repeatedly proved to be highly virulent on the equine subject and had been maintained for a number of years in the laboratory by passing through rabbits and guinea-pigs,
220 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III Prior to the infective inoculation, each animal was kept under observation for about two weeks, and during this period its blood was sub-inoculated once into rabbits and was also daily examined in wet smears for the presence of surra trypa- nosomes, and it was brought under experimentation only after it had definitely proved to be free from surra. The drug used in these trials was Naganol and the dosage employed was at the rate of 5 grms. per 1,000 lb. bodyweight in a 10 per cent aqueous solution administered intravenously, this dosage having been based upon the results pre- viously obtained in the laboratory in the treatment of equines, artificially infected with surra. In view of the lower susceptibility of cattle to surra, Baermann [ 1923 ] would appear to regard it as probable that a small dose of Naganol is sufficient for bringing about a cure in bovine surra, and Iyer and Sarwar [ 1935 ] have actually used what would appear to be smaller doses of the drug, with apparent success, in the treatment of this disease. In the present trials, however, it seemed desir- able to use the maximum therapeutic dose of the drug, in conformity with Ehrlich's well-known dictum therapia sterilisans magna, so as to prevent any possi- bility of the development of Naganol-resistant strains of T. evansi. As will be seen from Tables I and II, seven animals received a single injection of Naganol, whilst two received three injections at intervals of three months, the remaining six animalsCURATIVE TREATMENT OF SURRA IN BOVINES 221 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 1.
222 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III THE COURSE THAT SURRA RUNS IN BOVINES AND OBSERVATIONS UPON THE EFFECT OF NAGANOL IN THE CONTROL OF THIS CONDITION A perusal of the available literature shows that, while a considerable amount of valuable observations has been made upon the clinical symptoms of equine surra, the information on record concerning the course run by surra in bovines is very fragmentary. The present trials provided an excellent opportunity of main- taining an accurate record of the symptoms exhibited by the " control " animals during, as already mentioned, an observation period of a year and a half and a brief account of these symptoms may be appropriately included here. Fig. I, which represents the chart of " Control "Buffalo No. 6, is illustrative of the course of the disease as usually observed in bovines. As will be seen, this animal developed the infection after an incubation period of about one week and during the following five days it showed consistently large numbers of parasites in the circulating blood, with a corresponding elevation in the body tem- perature. During the eighteen days that followed, the parasites continued to make their appearance in an erratic manner, until after a sudden increase in their num- bers about the 30th day from the date of infective inoculation, they disappeared altogether. Curiously, although the parasites were never again seen in blood smears from this animal, nor was there a suspicious rise in its body temperature, its blood proved infective on sub-inoculation into rabbits, at the end of the second month from the date on which the parasites were last encountered on smear examination (Table I).

224 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III The protocol of Buffalo No. 4 (Table I) illustrates the difficulty of declaring an animal as cured on the basis of results obtained from a single series of sub- inoculations. As will be seen, this animal developed the infection after an incuba- tion period of about one week and it showed the parasites in its blood on three occasions during the period of about one month and a half that followed. Two rabbits were sub-inoculated from this animal about the third month from the date of infective inoculation, but neither developed the infection. On the other hand, when the sub-inoculation was repeated about three months later, the results were positive. The spasmodic behaviour of the parasites in bovines is likewise charac- teristically illustrated in the case of Hill Bull No. 1035 (Table I). In this case, the parasites, after a continued absence in the circulating blood for a period of more than three months, suddenly re-appeared for a single day and were never encountered again on blood smear examination. The history of Buffalo No. 1849 provides a feature of special interest in that it was kept under observation for as long a period as three years and eight months (29th April 1930 to 20th December 1933). This animal, which represented the " control" to Buffalo No. 1897 (infra), had been actually brought under experimentation long before the main series of experiments originating out of the Australian inquiry were initiated. On referring to Table I, it will be observed that in the case of this animal, the parasites were encoun- tered on four occasions on blood smear examination, at intervals of 71, 5 and 16 days respectively. Sub-inoculation from this animal into rabbits was not com- menced until after about one year from the date of infective inoculation and was repeated on five occasions at intervals of 113, 134, 196 and, later, at three-monthly intervals, but the results were all negative. It is noteworthy that neither in the case of this animal, nor in the case of Buffalo No. 1897, which represented its pair, was any special precautionary measure adopted to protect them from bites of flies, until after an expiry of about two years from the date of infective inoculation, when they were housed, along with the other animals, in fly-proof stables. Bull No. 1055 represents an extreme instance where the inoculation of surra parasite failed to produce any results whatsoever, beyond the usual reaction fol- lowing upon the incubation period of the disease. Buffalo No. 1 B had been originally included in the series of " controls ", but having proved unsuitable for use, it bad to be discarded and replaced, about three months later, by Buffalo No. 4 to which a reference has already been made. As will be seen from Table I, this animal relapsed after an apparent recovery lasting for only about 13 days. It is noteworthy that while the initial reaction of the disease was definitely a thermal reaction associated with the occurrence of varying numbers of parasites in the circulating blood, the relapses, on the other hand, were, as a rule, devoid
CURATIVE TREATMENT OF SURRA IN BOVINES 225 of any febrile symptoms and were characterized by the appearance of the parasites only. This would appear to be in striking contrast with what one observes in the case of equine surra, in which the succession of parasitic relapses is almost invariably associated with elevation of body temperature. In regard to the animals treated with Naganol, a single injection of the drug, administered at the rate of 5 grms. per 1,000 lb. body weight, invariably resulted in a complete sterilization of the circulating blood, as judged by the results of blood- smear examination and of periodical sub-inoculation of blood into small animals (Table II). In all cases, the parasites disappeared from the circulating blood with- in 24 hours of the injection of the drug (Figs. 2 and 3) and did not appear again during the observation period of (in the majority of cases) one year and a half. It is to be mentioned, however, that Buffalo No. 1574 died of enteritis and debility about 11 months prior to the date (December 20, 1933) on which it was due to be discontinued and that no opportunity, therefore, occurred for testing the infectivity of its blood on a susceptible equine subject. Nevertheless, the post-treatment period of about eight months and a half during which it was kept under observation would appear for all practical purposes to be sufficiently long for assessing the value of the remedy in this case.

CURATIVE TREATMENT OF SURRA IN BOVINES 229 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG.3.
230 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III A reference to column 4 in Table II and to Figs. 2 and 3 will show that, while in every one of the artificially infected animals, the disease was allowed to be fully established, in no instance did the infection proceed beyond 48 hours when treatment was applied. The object of this was to make sure that recovery was actually brought about as a result of drug intervention and not, as has frequently been observed to be the case, by a process of spontaneous disappearance of the parasites. However, what appeared to be the conclusive evidence of the efficacy of Naganol was provided by the fact that in none of the treated animals were the parasites encountered either on smear examination or as a result of sub-inoculation. It will be observed (Table II) that two of the animals received a course of three injections of Naganol at intervals of about three months. This procedure was adopted in order to ensure the maximum possibility of success being obtained with the drug treatment and in view of the uncertainty of the results to be expected from the single-dose therapy, for, as already mentioned, the present trials had for their object the development of a method of rendering cattle permanently free from surra, quite irrespective of the quantity of the drug required for the attainment of this object. Buffalo No. 1897, which represented the pair to " Control " Buffalo No. 1849, is of special interest in that it was kept under post-treatment observation for more than three years and a half, without any evidence of relapse being exhi- bited by it, for it is almost needless to stress the importance of the time factor in assessing the curative value of a drug for bovine surra which is so liable to run a chronic course, with the parasites unaccountably appearing in the circulating blood after the animal concerned has, to all appearances, recovered from the disease. It is noteworthy that, whether in the case of the treated animals or in the case of the " controls," the results of sub-inoculation of blood into susceptible ponies at the termination of the experiments were of an entirely negative order, and this would seem to confirm the view expressed by certain workers (ante) that in bovine surra recovery may occur spontaneously without the necessity of drug intervention. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS This investigation was undertaken to test the possibility of curing bovine surra with certainty by means of Naganol. For this purpose, a total of fifteen animals, comprising six bulls and nine buffaloes, were artificially infected with a laboratory strain of Trypanosoma evansi and housed in fly-proof stables. Out of the fifteen animals, four bulls and five buffaloes were treated intravenously with one to three doses of Naganol at the rate of 5 grms. per 1,000 lb. body weight and the remaining six animals were kept as " controls ". One treated and one untreated buffalo were kept under observation for about three years and a half, while the observation period in the case of the remaining animals ranged from thirty-nine days (in one
CURATIVE TREATMENT OF SURRA IN BOVINES 231 instance) to about one year and a half. During these periods, one " control " bull and all the four " control" buffaloes showed the parasites at various intervals in their circulating blood, as revealed by the results of blood smear examination or of the sub-inoculation of their blood into rabbits, the maximum period up to which evidence of infection was thus obtained having been about six months (Buffalo No. 4) from the date of infective inoculation. The treated animals, however, remained entirely free from infection after the initial sterilization of their blood by drug injection. At the termination of the experiments, about 200 c.c. of blood from each of the "controls," as well as from each of the treated animals, was sub- inoculated into susceptible equine subjects, but the results were of an entirely nega- tive order, and from this one would conclude that in bovine surra spontaneous recovery is the rule rather than the exception. Nevertheless, the fact that some of the " controls " continued to show the parasites periodically for some length of time after receiving the infective inoculation would appear to point to the advisability of treating all actual or suspected cases of bovine surra with Naganol before they are declared to be definitely free from the disease. While a single dose of Naganol proved effective in at least seven out of the nine- cases treated with this drug, it would seem very desirable, in view of the observa- tions recorded by Lagas [ 1926 ], to repeat the dosage once, and, if possible, even twice, at intervals of one month, particularly when the animal concerned is in- tended for export to countries known to be free from surra.

COMPOSITION OF COLOSTRUM FROM THE MONTGOMERY COWS BY ASGHAR ALI SHAH, Chemical Laboratories, Agricultural Research Institute, Lyallpur [Received for publication on 16th April 1936] (With one text-figure) The milk produced by the cow during the first few days after calving is some- times referred to as' beastings ' or' green milk ' but more commonly as colostrum. The composition, condition, colour, taste and smell of the milk immediately after parturition differs considerably from that of normal milk which the cow gives, say, a week later. The change to normal takes place gradually and is complete within 5 to 6 days, although some of the ingredients such as fat and milk sugar change over very rapidly to their normal proportions. The pungent taste and slimy appearance of the colostrum do not last for more than a couple of days. The dairy herd attached to the Agricultural College, Lyallpur, consists of the cows of the Montgomery breed alone and true colostrum as generally obtained from these animals is usually yellow and very often deep yellow in colour. Our knowledge about the true function of colostrum in the nutritional meta- bolism of the new born animals is limited. It is generally supposed to act as a laxative and facilitates the early passage of the meconium from the intestinal tract of the infant animal. Another rôle sometimes attributed to this product is its high concentration of nutritive elements in a form easily digested by the young animals [Ling, 1930]. Earle and Gamble [1934] working on young foals have discovered yet another function for this material. The results of their investi- gation have shown that, in at least some species, colostrum serves to immunize the new born animal passively against bacteria for which its dam has already acquired immunity. Until recently, the belief was commonly held that the milk is secreted pri- marily for the nourishment of the calf and scientists and laymen alike believed that full development of the mammary glands and the actual secretion of milk could be brought about only by the normal processes occurring during pregnancy. The fact that the nature of the milk immediately after calving was different from that of the normal milk has been attributed to the immediate specific requirements of the newly born animal. Recent work carried out by the Bureau of Dairy In- dustry, U. S. A., as reported by Evans [1934], has, however, shown that pregnancy (234)
COMPOSITION OF COLOSTRUM FROM MONTGOMERY COWS 235 is not necessary for full development of the mammary glands and milk secretion and that by the injection of extracts of the anterior pituitary gland into a virgin dairy heifer, a daily milk yield of 15 to 18 pounds was obtained and maintained over several months after the injections had ceased. No mention is, however, made of the composition of the milk obtained. It would be interesting to know if the milk was uniformly alike in this respect throughout the entire period of lactation or if the composition of the first milk obtained from the virgin heifer differed in any way from the milk obtained, say 3 or 4 days after, i.e., if any colos- trum was secreted. The absence of any difference between the two would lend a strong support to the belief that colostrum with its characteristic properties which are so widely different from those of the normal milk is elaborated simply to meet the requirements of the newly born animal. The object of the present note, however, is not to say anything on the biologi- cal functions of colostrum, but to present a certain amount of analytical data with regard to colostrum secreted by Montgomery cows. The figures presented in the following tables give the analytical composition of the colostrum and the milk from three different cows of the Montgomery breed kept at the Agricultural College Dairy Farm, Lyallpur. The percentage com- position of the colostrum from all the three animals, immediately after calving, was as follows :236 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]
COMPOSITION OF COLOSTRUM FROM MONTGOMERY COWS 237 It will be noted that the colostrum from Cow No. 2 contains a much greater amount of total solids than that from both of the other animals and the difference is due to the greater amount of fat and casein present in the colostrum of this animal. The other ingredients do not show so wide a difference. The complete analytical data, showing the gradual change from colostrum to normal milk in the case of all the three animals, is presented in the three Tables I, II, and III that follow. Table IV gives the average figures from the three individual animals and these are represented graphically in the diagram. The changes suffered by the individual ingredients may be summarised thus:238 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III TABLE I Colostrum analysis (First Period) Serial No. Date and time of sampling Specific Gravity at 60°F Total Solids Per cent Fat Per cent Acidity Per cent Total Proteins Per cent Albumin and Globulin Per cent Casein Per cent Lactose Per cent Mineral matter Per cent Remarks 1 20th Novr. 1928 E 1.056 21.90 4.3 0.315 13.42 10.03 3.42 2.80 .803 E.

BOVINE TRYPANOSOMIASIS IN CENTRAL PROVINCES WITH AN ACCOUNT OF SOME RECENT OUTBREAKS BY CAPT. BACHAN SINGH, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Investigation Officer, Central Provinces and Berar. [Received for publication on 29th February 1936.] (With Plates VIII244 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III In the Central Provinces itself, an outbreak of cattle trypanosomiasis was reported by Stirling [1927] from the Western Districts, and, as is to be described later, the present writer recently came across several outbreaks of the same disease in the Saugor District, with a mortality rate of more than 96 per cent, these observa- tions completely disproving the hypothesis hitherto held that cattle and buffaloes act merely as " reservoirs " of trypanosomiasis without exhibiting any clinical symptoms of the disease. SOME OUTBREAKS OF THE DISEASE The first outbreak of the disease reported to the writer was from Kurwai State, from where it spread quickly to the border villages of Khurai tahsil of Saugor district, with the result, that within a short period the whole area lying along the border became affected. The author immediately availed himself of the opportunity to study the outbreak, and undertook investigation at Bamora village on the 2nd October, 1935, where the disease was confirmed by microscopical exa- mination in six cases. Altogether five villages were visited in that area and the number of deaths noted in each was approximately as follows :Ind. Jour. Vety. Sci. & Anim. Husb., Vol. VI, Pt. III. PLATE VIII [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 1. Bullock No. 2BOVINE TRYPANOSOMIASIS IN CENTRAL PROVINCES 245 The second interesting outbreak of bovine trypanosomiasis encountered by the author occurred in Damoh tahsil in Saugor district, towards the end of November. The author's attention was at first directed on perusal of the contagious disease register to the record of certain outbreaks, which had passed either for Anthrax or for bhora, but no definite diagnosis seemed to have been made in these cases by the local veterinary staff. About the same time another similar report of bhora came from a village known as Mala. On the 24th November, this village was visited by the author and there he found a heifer in extremis, and its blood revealed the presence of trypanosomes under the microscope. During the course of investigation, the local cultivators told the writer that the disease was also prevalent in the adjacent villages of Rond and Sagra. On receipt of this information an investigation was undertaken on the 26th and 27th November in both these villages, where the disease proved to be mostly of a chronic type, with a high rate of mortality. The actual number of deaths recorded up to the 26th October in these two localities were as follows:246 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III Microscopic examination of blood reveals the presence of trypanosomes in the acute form of the disease quite readily, whereas in the sub-acute and chronic forms they are rarely seen in the peripheral circulation. Soon after death, smears of heart blood, lung, liver and cerebro-spinal fluid failed to reveal any trypano- somes. SUSCEPTIBILITY Bullocks when overworked proved to be more susceptible than other cattle, while on the other hand buffaloes appeared to resist the disease. Some young calves below six months of age were reported to have succumbed during the recent outbreaks, and in the case of one calf under six months, the author detected try- panosomes on examination of blood smears. REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION A map is appended (Plate X) to indicate the incidence of bovine trypanosomiasis as observed during the current year, the disease in all cases having been confirmed microscopically on examination of blood smears in the Veterinary Laboratory, Nagpur. In Saugor district, where the author investiga- ted the problem, the area chiefly affected was low lying and covered with a wild growth of tall thick grass known as kans, a large part of the area remaining under water during rainy season. SEASONAL INCIDENCE The disease runs a definite seasonal course. The first outbreaks occurred during the month of August, and these spread extensively during September, October and November, when they began to subside. Some chronic cases occurred in December and January in the villages where the disease had already been prevailing since the month of November, but no fresh outbreak was reported during the later two months. TREATMENT Twenty-one animals were treated in the month of October by means of tartar emetic solution administered intravenously, the dose used varying from 10 to 15 grains in 20 to 30 c.c. of distilled water. All the twenty-one animals were suffering from an acute type of the disease. This method of treatment proved to be strikingly successful, for only one of the treated animals succumbed and all others recovered. The efficacy of this method of treatment was also tested upon more than fifty chronic cases, the majority of which were in an advanced stage of the disease, but the results were not so encouraging, for the treatment was successful in about 30 per cent of the cases only. These results are summarized in Tables I & II.

BOVINE TRYPANOSOMIASIS IN CENTRAL PROVINCES 249 IDENTITY OF THE CAUSAL ORGANISMS A number of blood smears were submitted to the Muktesar Laboratory for examination and the following report was received :250 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III 7. During 1935, very serious outbreaks of the disease have been recorded in Saugor district, with a mortality rate of more than 96 per cent. 8. The trypanosomes concerned in these outbreaks were examined at the Muktesar laboratory and found indistinguishable from Trypanosoma evansi. 9. The method of treatment adopted was an intravenous injection of tartar emetic and this proved very effective when given in the initial stage of an acute form of the disease. In the chronic form, however, it proved successful only in 30 per cent of the cases. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The author takes this opportunity to thank the Veterinary Inspector, Saugor, and those Veterinary Assistant Surgeons who helped him in different ways in this investigation. The author feels very grateful to the Director, Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, for his examining the material submitted, and to Mr. S. K. Sen, M.Sc., Entomologist of the same Institute, for going through this paper and his helpful suggestions. In conclusion, the author greatly appreciates the services of Mr. G. N. Khardenavis, Clerk, for keeping an accurate record of field observations. REFERENCES Anantnarayan Rao (1923). Some observations on Trypanosomiasis in Madras Presidency. Ind. Vet. J. 8, 111.

KRISHNA IYER, G.M.V.C., Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar [Received for publication on 18th April, 1936.] (With Plates XI252 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III black alimentary debris. On histological examination, the indurated wall of this ulcer revealed suppurating areas, with cryptococci located in the cells and outside them. This reference constitutes the only record of the occurrence of intestinal cryptococcosis in equines, excepting perhaps the cases of Cornish Bowden [1904] and Descazeaux [1921] to be mentioned below. Nocard and LeClainche [1896] state that the specific lesions may extend to the larger bronchi and that occasionally they are found in the lung parenchyma as well. In Japan the condition had been known for years under the name " Japanese Farcy " and Tokishige [1896] claims to have found it occurring in cattle besides horses. He observes that in equines the lesions may be found in the lungs, liver, spleen and bones, and that the lung lesions occur in the form of lobular pneumonia with fairly frequent greyish nodules resembling those of glanders. It should be noted here that Tokishige was the first worker to cultivate this organism and to allocate it to the class Saccharomyces. In India, this condition was first described by Moore [1896] under the name ulcerative lymphangitis. In giving a detailed account of Moore's cases, Pease [1897] also regarded them as identical with ulcerative lymphangitis. Lingard [1901], the first worker to recognise the organisms in this country, was of the opinion that the outbreaks of this condition at Karnal and Hapur originated from some mules imported from Italy. With a view to determine the relative suscepti- bility of each species he carried out, by the subcutaneous route, a series of experi- mental inoculations on equines, bovines, buffaloes, sheep and goats with fresh material from a clinical case. A few weeks after the inoculation, large lesions were observed at and around the seat of inoculation in the horses and mules, and to a smaller extent in bovines. None of the animals, however, was found to have developed any internal lesions, when autopsied about two years later. Pallin [1904], in his excellent treatise on this disease, states that usually the lesions of epizootic lymphangitis are confined to the skin, but occasionally they may occur on the mucous membranes and they may even extend to the internal organs. The lesions may be found on any part of the body, but are frequently associated with parts exposed to wounds from kicks, contusions and harness galls. This worker further observes that in about 7 to 10 per cent of cases, the mucous membrane covering the nasal chambers, air sinuses, the pharynx, larynx and the upper third of the trachea and also the conjunctiva are affected. The mucosal lesions, it is stated, are first noticed as small papules or pimples which rapidly develop into vesicles and burst, forming well-defined ulcers with a raised edge and a dug out centre. Pallin succeeded in proving that the disease is readily inocu- lable to horses, donkeys and mules, but he failed to reproduce the disease in cattle, sheep, goats and guinea-pigs by inoculation. According to him, systemic distur- bances rarely ensue in the early stages of the cutaneous form ; but in advanced stages intermittent fever and a rapid fall in condition have been observed.
AN UNUSUAL CASE OF EPIZOOTIC LYMPHANGITIS IN A MULE 253 Working in Great Britain, Runciman [1904] observed that the first symptoms of the disease are a slight rise of temperature and sometimes a filling of the hind limbs, diminished appetite and a rapid loss of condition. No further change takes place for days, until suddenly cutaneous nodules make their appearance and cover the whole of the animal's body within a space of 12 to 24 hours. Such cases are not amenable to any treatment and rapidly progress to a fatal issue. Until the appearance of the nodules, the symptoms observed are extremely vague and provide little of diagnostic value. According to this worker, cases of this kind are of digestive or respiratory origin, the primary nodules being present in the internal organs. In the primary cutaneous form of the disease, he is unaware of any symptoms other than the presence of the nodules ; while he is confident that cases of primary internal infection do occur where the condition can be diagnosed only after the appearance of the specific nodules in a visible part of the body. He cites a few cases of primary internal infection he encountered, where the animals were sick a long time before the actual appearance of external lesions. In one of his cases, where the animal was ill for some time, the nodules appeared all of a sudden and the animal died. On post mortem examination, abscesses were found in the lungs which contained a thick creamy pus, suggesting to him that the lungs were the primary seat of infection. Hence Runciman considers it as hardly probable that the infection in this disease is conveyed exclusively through the skin. Cornish Bowden [1904] records the particulars of a horse exhibiting severe premonitory and systemic symptoms which were followed subsequently by severe diarrhoea and cutaneous lesions. This animal was purchased in good condition on 7th July, 1904, it went off feed a week later, and rapidly went down in condi- tion until it developed severe foetid diarrhoea, with small cutaneous sores which were noticed later on 20th July, 1904. The animal, however, was successfully treated with potassium iodide, iodine and quinine and was discharged, cured on 18th August, 1904. This was presumably a case of the disease where infection of the intestines preceded the involvement of the skin. Harber [1913] had experience of numerous well marked lesions appearing on the body of horses in the course of 48 hours, and of some unbroken buds appearing in 24 hours. However, he was unable to detect any wounds on the affected animals, which might have served as portals of entry for the parasites concerned. He remarks that, in these cases, the organisms could not have been carried by harness, etc., as these animals were kept in strict quarantine and were not being worked. Harber [1913] presumes that the disease becomes generalized to the cutis from primary lesions in the internal organs, although he failed to encounter cases of this kind personally. He adds that the disease spreads more rapidly in donkeys than in horses, and concludes that flies are mainly involved in the spread of the infection. Tokishige's contention that cattle in Japan may develop atypical lesions of the disease has been questioned by Wallis Hoare [1913], since this view is not
254 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III in accord with the fact that bovines in other countries have resisted all attempts at experimental infection. Hoare goes on to say that the disease being so pre- valent in Japan, almost every horse is liable to develop an attack at an early age, and that a horse is considered more valuable there after recovery than if it had never had an attack, as it is then held to be immune. In Morocco, Menod and Velu [1915] described what they believe to be cases of delayed relapses among horses, as opposed to reinfection, occurring from 3 to 6 months after apparent complete recovery. These workers refer to the occurrence of osseous lesions in this disease, averring at the same time that these constitute the most serious and refractory form. They add that, with rare exceptions, the extracutaneous lesions are often secondary, and that out of 20 cases of epizootic lymphangitis slaughtered as incurable in one year, 13 were found to have developed bony lesions. Fayet, Leysses and Prudhomme [1917] record under the heading " a rare seat of epizootic lymphangitis " lesions in the post-pharyngeal lymphatic glands of a horse. In the experience of Descazeaux (1921], a horse, which was under treatment for epizootic lymphangitis with lesions about the withers, died of some digestive disorder. In this case, cryptococci were found in the enlarged prescapular and axillary lymph glands, but the stomach and intestines showed no specific altera- tion whilst the mesenteric glands appeared healthy. However, smears from the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines, as also from the contents of a Habronema abscess in the stomach showed on examination the presence of numerous cryptococci. Histological examination of the Habronema tumour showed masses of cryptococci and the helminths, whilst giant cells containing numerous cryptococci were found in the submucous lymph spaces. Velu [1924] proposes the name Cryptococcus marandei for the parasite affect- ing the lachrymal tract of donkeys, and adds that the parasite can be transmitted readily from donkey to donkey with infective material and that filamentous forms and ascospores do not occur in these parasites. Gronow [1924] found mycelial and yeast forms of the parasite in the pus from a local abscess of a horse produced by subcutaneous inoculation of a living culture of the organism. Michelon [1925] mentions the occurrence of four abscesses in the lungs and one in the bronchial gland of a horse due to Cryptococcus farciminosus. The abscesses contained yellowish white pus. Hutyra and Marek [1926] write that the parasites may also be present in apparently normal lymph glands and lymph spaces of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane of affected horses, and quote the above-cited experience of Descazeaux in this connection. These workers add that sometimes small nodules and puru- lent foci may be present in the lungs and testicles of affected horses.
AN UNUSUAL CASE OF EPIZOOTIC LYMPHANGITIS IN A MULE 255 Paine [1931] observes that the disease is more prevalent in tick-infested areas and that ticks take an active part in its transmission. Bardelli and Cilli [1931] describe a case of osteomyelitis of the left tibia of a horse due to Cryptococcus farciminosus. In the interior of the tibial crest, there was a purulent centre, 2 cm. in dimension, surrounded by a zone of reaction manifested as a condensing ostitis, about 5 mm. in width. Numerous cryptococci were seen in the purulent fluid. From the Sudan, Bennett [1931] describes a form of interstitial pneumonia affecting horses and mules but not donkeys caused by Cryptococcus farciminosus and thinks that these lesions may have been overlooked in the past. The symptoms consisted of accelerated and increasingly shallow respiration, irregular rise in temperature, steady loss of condition though the appetite for the most part remained normal. The pleura and the bronchial lymph glands were un- involved, and only in one of the many cases observed was there an evidence of the presence of superficial or cutaneous lesions of epizootic lymphangitis. No other internal organs were affected. From a histopathological point of view, the author writes that the lesions commence with lymphocytic infiltration of the terminal bronchi without any evidence of vascular congestion, the infiltration later on extending to the interlobular septa until one or more whole lobules are involved. The lymphocytes then get replaced or are outnumbered by large mono-nuclear cells derived from the alveolar epithelium and these gradually invade and des- troy the small bronchioles, veins and arteries. This is followed by a fusion of the mono-nuclear cells resulting in the formation of giant cells containing large num- bers of cryptococci, this in turn being followed by the destruction of the invaded cells and the continued proliferation of the parasites. In a later publication Bennett [1932], places on record the occurrence of hyphae of Cryptococcus far- ciminosus in a natural case of epizootic lymphangitis. The subject was an aged horse which had extensive lesions, covering practically the whole of its skin, extending to the nostrils and affecting the sub-maxillary lymph glands. In the lungs there was present a number of pea-like scattered nodules, closely simulat- ing glanders. In the smears from the lung nodules, characteristic hyphae of the cryptococcus were encountered, such as are formed in artificial cultures. HISTORY OF THE PRESENT CASE The clinical material on which this paper is based, was made available to this Institute through the courtesy of Major A. J. Kelly, R.A.V.C., Officer Commanding, Military Veterinary Hospital, Jubbulpore, and at the outset the writer wishes to express his indebtedness to this officer for kind permission to utilise the material for the preparation of this article.

Helminthiasis was suspected but the faeces failed to show any worm ova while the blood count was found to be normal. Diarrhoea started on 1st December, 1934 and it persisted for a week, when the mule began to lose condi- tion. Diarrhoea started again on 15th December, 1934 and persisted through- out the progress of the disease. The mule grew weaker day by day, being finally unable to rise. It was destroyed on 3rd January, 1935 by which time it had been reduced practically to a skeleton. In the hospital the animal had received the routine treatment against worms as adopted in Military Veterinary Hospitals in India. On post mortem examination, a few strongyles were found in the intestines. Portions of the bowels and a few mesenteric glands were sent to this Institute for examination. On enquiry, the information was elicited that the mule had shown no cutaneous lesions, nor any wounds or any cording of the lymphatics on the skin. However, it had a history of a punctured foot and of a few days treatment in hospital about two months prior to its re-admission. LABORATORY EXAMINATION Macroscopical examination.Ind. Jour. of Vety.

AN UNUSUAL CASE OF EPIZOOTIC LYMPHANGITIS IN A MULE 257 the parasites multiply by a process of budding and such division forms were not infrequent in the smears. Histopathology.258 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III MYCELIAL FORMS The occurrence of mycelial forms of the cryptococcus in pus smears from the lesions of epizootic lymphangitis has been recorded by Tokishige, Gronow and Bennett. In the case now under report, the affected lymph glands revealed pure yeast forms only but in sections of the intestinal ulcers, short and long mycelial forms were seen (Plate XIII, Fig. 7). The entire absence of any other micro-organisms in these sections precludes the possibility of these mycelial forms being contaminants. On the other hand, the absence of mycelial forms in the closed lesions of the lymphatic glands and their presence in the open ulcers of the intestines only suggests that the relative oxygen supply may have been a factor in the production of the mycelia. Though the statement of Castellani [1926], that the hyphae of the members of the family Cryptococcaceae are little different from their conidia in appearance, both being yeast-like in form suggests other- wise, long, delicate and filamentous mycelia have been seen in sections in the present instance. CULTURE Although the morbid material was sent preserved in 10 per cent formalin, cultures were attempted from the central portion of the larger-sized mesenteric glands, to ascertain if the formalin had not penetrated into this area, but as was expected no growth was obtained and the cultural characteristics of the fungus could not be studied. DISCUSSION Although a good deal has been written on the subject of epizootic lymphan- gitis, there is still no clear evidence as to the mode of infection and the mecha- nism of the spread of this disease. In the past, attention has been almost entirely confined to the more frequent cutaneous form of the disease, and the current belief has been that the infection takes place through some pre-existing wound in the body. Infection of the mouth and lips has been said to occur as a result of an affected animal biting at ulcers on the legs or other parts of the body. It would appear certain from the observations recorded in this paper and from those in one or two other records that there are alternative modes of infec- tion as well. For instance in the pulmonary form recorded by Bennett and others, inhalation has been proved to be responsible for the infection ; whereas the already cited experience of Descazeaux, who found crypotcocci in a Habronema abscess in the stomach of a horse suffering from digestive disorders and dying of epizootic lymphangitis, the oral route must have been responsible. Similarly in our Jubbulpore case, ingestion was evidently the mode of infec- tion. The worms found on post mortem examination in the bowels might have produced some injuries in the mucosa. The ingested Cryptococci, during the

AN UNUSUAL CASE OF EPIZOOTIC LYMPHANGITIS IN A MULE 259 course of their passage through the bowels were evidently taken up by the pha- gocytes in the injured part. Thus once established, the lesions increased giving rise to inflammation, abscess formation and the subsequent chain of events already described. From the intestinal lesions, the infection spread to the mesen- teric glands by way of the lymphatics. The punctured foot observed a few months before the animal was taken ill had apparently no relation with the causa. tion of this condition, for the reason that the parasites, even if they had been taken up through the puncture, could not have infected the bowels and mesen- teric glands primarily to the exclusion of the cutis and its lymphatics. That Runciman and Harber observed cutaneous lesions appearing all of a sudden in enormous numbers in horses which had been ailing for some time has been mentioned, and the primary seats of infection in such cases are no doubt in the internal organs. In such cases, it is possible that the organisms gain entry into the blood vessels, as often happens in amoebiasis, and are carried as emboli and deposited in all parts of the body. Their spread by way of the lymphatics could not have produced such an enormous crop of lesions all of a sudden to the exclusion of the numerous lymphatic glands, which act as filters and arrest the progress of the organisms. Hence spread by way of the blood stream appears to be the only probable method but this requires confirmation. SUMMARY An account is given of an atypical form of epizootic lymphangitis affecting the intestines and mesenteric glands of a mule which died showing symptoms of enteritis. The condition was not diagnosed during the life due to the absence of any cutaneous manifestation and the animal was treated for worms only. A short description is given of the clinical symptoms noticed during life and the lesions encountered on post mortem examination. A brief review is given of the relevant literature including that dealing with atypical forms of the disease. Histopathology of the lesions and the microscopical features of the parasites are described. The methods of infection and spread of the lesions in this disease are also discussed.

ANANT NARAYAN RAO, G.M.V.C., Lecturer in Parasitology, Madras Veterinary College, AND M. RAMAKRISHNA PILLAY, G.M.V.C., Reserve Veterinary Assistant Surgeon. [Received for publication on 28th. March, 1936.] Cutaneous myiasis, though common in the domesticated animals in India, has not, it would seem, attracted much attention from veterináry workers in this country. Some medical workers have recorded such conditions in man, but Patton [1921, 1922] appears to be the only one among them, who has published some notes on the Indian Calliphorinae which cause cutaneous myiasis in man and animals. He records that Chrysomia bezziana Vill. is the commonest cause of such conditions. Besides this fly, which is an obligatory myiasis producer, he found larvae of Chrysomia megacephala Fabr. in the sores of three bovines, and those of Lucilia argyricephala Macq., in three other bovines in the Bombay Presidency. These two flies usually breed in dead meat, but may cause cutane- ous myiasis though perhaps rarely. The writers obtained maggots both alive and preserved, from fly-blown sores of domesticated animals in this Presidency for one year, commencing from December 1934 to the end of November 1935. The live larvae were despatched from the districts in dry earth, and by the time they arrived in the Laboratory by post, they had pupated. The puparia were kept in suitable receptacles and the flies that hatched out were collected for study. In all, 404 specimens were received from different animals, each sample containing 10 to 15 larvae. The study of these showed that 401 specimens were of Chrysomia bezziana and the other three of Lucilia argyricephala. The last three were obtained from bullocks, in two cases from sores on the neck and at the base of a loose horn of the third. These findings confirm the work of Patton, except in regard to myiasis caused by Chrysomia megacephala. Some breeding experiments with Chrysomia bezziana, C. megacephala and Lucilia argyricephala were done in this Laboratory and it was found that Chrysomia bezziana is purely obligatory in wounds, whereas the other two bred easily in dead meat.

262 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III The present work has made it possible to obtain some knowledge regarding the seasonal prevalence of these flies and the areas in which they abound in this Presidency. This knowledge may be useful in adopting measures to lessen the incidence of cutaneous myiasis in animals or man in those areas, at certain seasons. It is interesting to note that maggots of Chrysomia bezziana were received from sores on four fowls and two sheep. The maggots from the fowls were collect- ed from the sores on the cloaca in all cases and came from four different localities more or less widely separated from one another, viz., Dindigul, Cannanore, Anantapur, and Hospet. The first three were obtained in December and January and the last one in June. The maggots from sheep came from Anakapalle and Jeypore, both in Vizagapatam District. They were collected from a sore on the ear of one and from that on the neck of the other. It would appear that cutane- ous myiasis caused by Chrysomia bezziana in fowls and sheep has not been noticed in this Presidency, possibly in India, and this opportunity is taken to place the fact on record.

None was received from Godavari West, Nellore, Nilgiris and Tinnevelly districts. The fluctuation in the number of specimens from each district may be due to lack of interest in those concerned in collecting specimens. Hence it is difficult to say which of the districts has a larger incidence, but as one would expect, a large proportion of the specimens was received from South Kanara and Malabar on the West Coast where rainfall and humidity is great, and a small number from dry districts like Anantapur.

It is seen that from September to February, which is the cooler half of the year in Madras, the average time taken by the puparia to hatch is 8 days. In the months of March, April, July and August the time taken was seven days whereas, in the months of May and June which are the hottest months, none hatched. It was observed that the number of flies that hatched out from the puparia decreased gradually from February to April and began to increase from July. During the months of December and January, over 95 per cent of the puparia were productive.

Here again, there are factors which prevent one from arriving at any definite conclusion regarding seasonal incidence of the flies. Hence, with a certain amount of reserve, one would ven- ture to say that the large number of specimens received from December to the end of March probably indicates this as the optimum season for C. bezziana. The fall in the number of specimens during the hot season may be attributed to less flies hatching out of the puparia. Perhaps this is a natural control against over- population of C. bezziana. It would seem, therefore, that cutaneous myiasis in animals in this Presidency prevails mostly during the cool season of the year. The present work makes us believe that no " sheep maggot fly " (Lucilia sericata) exists in this Presidency. The maggots received from the two sheep referred to were of Chrysomia bezziana.
SOME NOTES ON CUTANEOUS MYIASIS IN ANIMALS. 265 There is another class of flies (Oestridae) which produces myiasis in the nasal chambers, stomach and intestines of animals, these are Oestrus ovis, Gastrophilus equi and Cobboldia elephantis, the larvae of which are received here for identi- fication, from time to time, from sheep, horses and elephants respectively in this Presidency. So far no larvae of Hypoderma bovis or of H. lineata have been recorded from indigenous bovines of this province. There are two instances of larvae of Hypoderma species being removed from a Tibetan yak and from some imported horses at Ootacamund, and sent here for identification. These animals evidently were infested with the larvae before arrival in South India. Oestrus ovis on the other hand seems to be fairly common here. It is interesting to record that, recently, a sample of fresh faeces containing a large number of maggots was brought to this Laboratory with the history that they were passed by a thorough-bred race horse. The maggots pupated within 24 hours after their arrival and a large number of Musca nebulo were hatched out of the puparia. If the history is correct, it would appear that these maggots which may have been accidentally ingested by the horse, passed through the intestinal canal without any damage to themselves. A few years ago a sample of faeces containing maggots, passed by a hound, was received from Khallikote. The hound had severe diarrhoea at the time. The maggots were received dead, and they resembled those of Musca nebulo. It would seem, therefore, that the larvae of Musca nebulo can cause accidental intestinal myiasis in animals. SUMMARY 1. The most common cause of cutaneous myiasis in animals including fowls and sheep is Chrysomia bezziana. On three occasions only maggots of Lucilia argyricephala were obtained from sores on bovines. 2. " Sheep maggot" fly (Lucilia sericata) and Hypoderma species have not been recorded in this province. 3. The possibility of the larvae of Musca nebulo causing accidental intestinal myiasis is recorded. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors are very grateful to Prof. P. A.

SECRETION AND COMPOSITION OF PAROTID SALIVA IN BUFFALOES BY G. K. SHARMA, G.P.V.C., Clinical Assistant, Department of Medicine, Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore. [Received for publication on 18th January 1936.] Most of the work on secretion and composition of saliva has been done on the dog, although some work has been done on the horse, ox, sheep, goat and pig ; but controversy still exists on certain points. No attempt, however, appears to have been made on the buffalo. It will, therefore, be not without interest to record some experiments made on this animal. PROCEDURE (a) All experiments were conducted on a buffalo-cow with a salivary fistula of the left parotid duct. (b) The animal was, in each case, secured in stocks and the head kept in a fixed position to ensure uniform flow of saliva. (c) All injections were made subcutaneously. (d) The quantity of saliva mentioned in the text was collected in five minutes' time for all experiments. (e) Saliva for the examination of the physical character and composition was collected before the injection of drugs from the parotid gland in a resting state. EFFECT OF PHYSIOLOGICAL REFLEXES It is not essential that the food should enter the mouth to cause the flow of saliva. The sight or odour or even the thought of food, provided the individual be hungry, calls forth salivary secretion ; the mouth is said to water. Pavlov [1910] has extensively studied the psychic salivary secretion in the dog, and has shown that the sight of meat calls forth a stringy saliva from the sub-maxillary and sublingual but none from the parotid, whereas the sight of dry meat powder or bread calls forth an abundant secretion of parotid saliva. Colin [1871] states that in herbivora the secretion of saliva is uninfluenced by the sight or smell of the foods. Scheunert and Trautmann [1921] remark that psychic secretion is slight in sheep, and it is probable that it is small or absent in all herbivora. It appears from the experiments made on the buffalo that slight psychic reflex exists, but it. is not as much developed as in the dog. The sight of food slightly increased the outflow of parotid saliva from 30 mls. to 36 mls. (266)
SECRETION AND COMPOSITION OF PAROTID SALIVA IN BUFFALOES 267 The animal with salivary fistula of the parotid duct was fed on green grass. The quantity of saliva collected during mastication was 42 mls., but when animal was fed on dry bhoosa there was a copious flow of saliva measuring 102 mls. The character of the food appears to play an important rôle on the parotid secretion, and dry food excites production of a larger quantity of saliva. ACTION OF DRUGS Two grains of pilocarpine nitrate and a grain and a half of arecoline hydro- bromide were injected at an interval of 24 hours between each. They produced a copious flow of saliva five minutes after injection. Atropine is an antagonistic to pilocarpine, and when injected in one-grain dose it markedly reduced the secre- tion. The action of the drugs on the parotid secretion is shown in the following table :268 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III TABLE II Thousand parts by weight of parotid saliva contain Saliva Water Total solids Organic matter Inorganic matter Parotid saliva . . . 991.5 8.5 1.7 6.8 The results of chemical analysis of the inorganic constituents are given in the following table.

Ptyalin is an amylolytic enzyme present in the saliva of man and in some domesticated animals ; it is capable of converting starch into dextrin and mal- tose. Ellenberger states that both the parotid and sub-maxillary secretions of horse and ox can convert starch into sugar. Smith [1890] says that in all domestic animals the parotid saliva possesses the highest degree of amylolytic power. In ruminants the diastatic action of saliva is about the same as that of the horses. Schwarz and Steinmetzer [1924] say that the saliva of ox contains no amylase. Palmer [1916] states that the amount of ptyalin present in the saliva of the ox is insignificant. From the review of the literature it is concluded that there is a difference of opinion about the presence of ptyalin in the saliva of ruminants. The presence of ptyalin in the parotid saliva of the buffalo was studied by Evans' method, and it was observed that the starch was neither converted into erythrodextrin nor into maltose when subjected to the action of the parotid saliva from the buffalo.
SECRETION AND COMPOSITION OF PAROTID SALIVA IN BUFFALOES 269 Further experiments were conducted to determine whether the parotid saliva of the buffalo contained a very small quantity of ptyalin, which may require a longer time to exert its action on the starch. Both boiled and unboiled solutions of starch were mixed with an equal quantity of saliva in two separate tubes and allowed to remain at 38° C. for two hours. At the end of this period neither ery- throdextrin nor maltose could be detected in either of the tubes. The solutions were allowed to remain at room temperature for 24 hours in presence of toluene but the starch remained unchanged. The experiments were repeated several times with identical results. It can reasonably be concluded from these experi- ments that ptyalin is absent in the parotid saliva of the buffalo. ACKNOWLEDGMENT Thanks are due to Mr. G. S. Khan, B.Sc., Lecturer in Chemistry at the college, for making the analysis of inorganic constituents of the saliva. REFERENCES Ellenberger (cited by F. Smith, 1921).

To illustrate the theories outlined above, I propose, in the short space avail- able, to give a few examples. A concrete example may be given from the horse, which although not among the meat-producing animals in Great Britain is closely related to them. The evolution in the skeleton (Fig. 1, Plate XIV) has followed a definite and uniform course of changes, consisting in the main of a progressive lengthening of the limb bones in relation to cranium size. This evolution has not been broken by a number of sharp changes, such as mutations affecting different parts of the body independently ; for example, no shortened limb bones, such as those which occur in the Dachshund dog (and also occasionally in the horse) and behave as Mendelian recessives, come in the series. These things are mutations that may easily be picked out by man and bred to form fancy strains, but they play no real part either in natural evolution or in the development of the proportions of the body in commercial meat- production. These mutations do not, as a rule, form intermediates when bred to the normal type, whereas when two different ' developed' types are crossed, all gradations between them may be obtained. In the horse (see Plate XIV) the different types of conformation are magnifications (light horses) or extensions (heavy horses) of the gradual changes which have taken place during the course of evolution. Cattle (beef and veal).272 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III they can be put in a series according to the rate and extent to which these propor- tions are developed. A beef Shorthorn bull 14 months old is as well developed in its proportions for meat as an adult Friesian bull 5½ years old, and the extent to which it develops eventually is far in excess of anything found in the dairy breeds.

THE INHERITANCE OF PRODUCTIVITY IN FARM LIVE STOCK II-MILK A. D. BUCHANAN SMITH (Institute of Animal Genetics, University of Edinburgh) . Can the science of genetics offer reasonable help to the live-stock producer ? If so, then by what means ? In this paper it falls to me to deal with these two questions from the point of view of milk-production in cattle. Before the scientist can tackle any problems he must be able to weigh or to measure that with which he is dealing. Both quantity and quality must be assessed. Thus genetical experiment in respect of eggs and milk is much easier than it is in the case of meat. As Dr. Hammond has so clearly stated, it is essential to be able to discriminate between the factors affecting the productivity of an animal that are due to environ- ment, nutrition, management, disease, etc., from those factors that are genetic. The difficulty of doing so is one of the rocks upon which the barque of the geneticist is most likely to founder; and the task is further complicated because attempts to correct for environmental and other variations are likely to mask a genetic factor. For instance, Mackintosh [1] has recently shown that, where it is necessary, for comparison, to correct the first-lactation-yield of dairy cattle, the correction factors employed often work reasonably well, but that in the case of one group of cows they were very far out. Up till now, about 400 papers have been written dealing principally with some aspect of the inheritance of milk-yield. Some useful information has been obtained, but that source is now becoming exhausted, and I think that any future information of scientific value regarding the inheritance of yield and quality of milk will be obtained only by deliberate experimentation. By deliberate experi- mentation I mean the control of environment and nutrition to the greatest possible extent, so that, although the production of one generation takes place many years after the production of that ancestral generation with which it is to be compared, the comparison may be as straightforward as possible and with the minimum use of correction factors. The need for this has been recognized by Dr. Graves and those in charge of the experiments conducted by the Bureau of Dairy Industry of the United States Department of Agriculture, and Dr. Lush informs me that several of the State agricultural experiment stations, such as Illinois and Nebraska, have now also laid down similar experiments with dairy cattle. This principle forms the basis (277)
278 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III of the experimental work that we are conducting with dairy cattle and pigs at the experimental farms of the Institute of Animal Genetics. The method adopted is to do our utmost to secure a uniform system of management and nutrition over a long period of years. There is no ' deliberate' experimentation. Results are being measured continuously. So far as I am aware, nowhere else is this principle of holding environment, etc., reasonably constant being employed for dairy cattle. Yet it is precisely the same principle as that employed, though not for genetic purposes, by the most venerable of all agricultural research institutes. The ' classical ' fields at Rothamsted, where certain plots have been under the same treatment for ninety years, form an excellent example of this method of passive research. Already, and without the results of this planned and yet passive research, there is information of undoubted value, of which perhaps the most important is that quantity of milk is transmitted to a great extent independently of quality as measured by fat-yield. But many of the other results are still open to question. The problems that are now being tackled are not so much the determination of the number of genetic factors concerned in the transmission of total yield as the analysis of particular aspects of total yield, e.g., persistency of lactation. The various characteristics of the lactation must be considered in relation to each other. In other words, we are not so much concerned with determining the number of genetic factors involved, as with analysing the lactation curve of individual animals under a standard environment. (To ensure this, the greater number of the calvings occur in two months of the year.) Two cows may give the same yield of milk, but the one may give that yield in 200 days whereas the other takes 300: or the two cows may give the same yields in the same time but yet have widely different lactation-curves. These, therefore, must be studied with refer- ence to the various qualities of the milk, amount of fat, sugar, protein, and natural minerals, as well as the colour, and size of fat-globule, etc., nor must the question of the relative weights of the cows be ignored both before and after the lactation. And all these are peculiarities concerning which we can already trace the workings of heredity. It is of fundamental importance to understand the action of these characteristics and their reaction on one another. Thus it is small wonder that simple selection by the mating of the best to the best gives a large proportion of disappointing results. One cow may yield 2,000 gallons for one set of genetic reasons, whereas another cow will accomplish the same yield while possessing a very different constitution. There is, therefore, need for analysis. Moreover, research of this nature will certainly discover whether abnormal modes of inheritance are operating, or whether quantity is simply a matter of multiple factors. These abnormal modes include such things as sex-linked
THE INHERITANCE OF PRODUCTIVITY IN FARM LIVE STOCK. 279 factors, and those combinations of genes which act as inhibitors of yield. The existence of such modes of inheritance can easily slow down progress by simple selection. Further, economic production may actually be best obtained when genes are in the heterozygous state. Personally, I do not think that this is the case in milk-production, though there are strong grounds for believing it to hold good for meat-production. In any case this is obviously a point that must be definitely ascertained: the required knowledge can only come from experiment. A further point is to find out whether certain combinations of characters, desirable from the standpoint of the practical breeder, are genetically possible. For instance, certain breeders desire cows giving 3,000 gallons of milk with 5 per cent butter-fat. The analysis-stage might conceivably show this to be as impos- sible as the desire of other cattle-breeders to establish a roan-coloured breed, roan being a heterozygote of red and white. A definite by-product of this type of investigation is that it enables a correla- tion to be made between the genetical and physiological factors affecting milk- production. No gene ever works directly on the character. Manifestation of the character follows some reaction of the anatomical or physiological structure. Inasmuch as this type of experiment provides what may be called the ' genetic yield ', these yields may be correlated to certain post-mortem findings, e.g., to the size of the organs of internal secretion. The maintenance of a herd for genetic experiment thus provides the ideal material for research into the physiology of milk-secretion. It is thus fundamental that, in applying the science of genetics to the complex problems of milk-production, the various genetic factors first be analysed. There can be no shadow of doubt that analysis is the pre-requisite of synthesis. Mean- while, patience must be exercised by those who would question the value of the application of the science of genetics. Rome was not built in a day, and the Romans built with stone and not with cattle that require nine months to conceive and a further three years to produce. With commendable reserve the United States Department of Agriculture [2] published only last year the results of the first planned experiment on the inheritance of milk-yield. It was a simple problem dealing with inbreeding. The experiment was begun in 1908, a quarter of a century previously. It has now been incorporated with a bigger experiment started about fifteen years ago, the results of which, I believe, will cause surprise to those who decry genetical experi- mentation with cattle on account of the slow rate of reproduction. It can, therefore, be stated with some confidence that we now see our way round the Scylla of the disentanglement of the genetic factors. This does in part answer the question, but not wholly, for on the other side of the genetic ship
280 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III looms up the Charybdis of the likelihood that the analysis will reveal so many genetic factors interacting with each other as to make the synthesis of the problem in its practical application almost an impossibility. An adequate reply to the opening questions of this paper demands the discussion of this point. To those who have time to reflect, the practical outcome of the work of the plant-geneticist is little short of amazing. For many crops he has managed to make two blades grow where none could grow before. We, animal geneticists, have good cause for envy, and it is well that we should point out that this cause lies not merely in the greater rate with which one generation of agricultural plants succeeds another and the large populations which can be conveniently raised, but also in the fact that the productivity of a plant is, as a rule, infinitely more easy to measure and to assess than is the productivity of an animal. The problem of an increase in the productivity of our live stockTHE INHERITANCE OF PRODUCTIVITY IN FARM LIVE STOCK. 281 There can be no doubt of the value of simple selection, combined with pedigree and the progeny test as a definite means for improving the productivity of our dairy cattle. There is equally no doubt that the rate of improvement is somewhat slower than it was. Granted time, patience, and money, can we reasonably expect that selection alone will effect the desired improvement in a manner such as Winter has shown to be possible with maize ? I do not think so. Without more fundamental knowledge, the rate of im- provement is bound to get slower. The problem is not the simple one of selection for one particular object. In striving to achieve a definite race of high producers, we desire to obtain a multitude of characters each of which depends upon a multi- tude of genes. I do not suggest that it is worth our while to determine precisely the number of genes involved in, say, an increase in the sugar-content of milk. But what is definitely of value is to discover whether an increase in the sugar- content can be secured by simple selection, and whether it is genetically or physiologically incompatible with the selection of other important characteristics. Unless we know these things, selection is bound to bring in its train a considerable amount of disappointment. But have we as yet obtained an adequate knowledge of the pure science of genetics ? He would be a fool who would so presume. Take, for instance, Dr. Fisher's theory of the evolution of dominance : with Nature as the agent of selection it is essential that those characters which benefit the organism be trans- mitted in a dominant manner. Dominance is, therefore, acquired by such charac- ters, though we are ignorant of the means by which it is acquired. With man as the selecting agent, it is of decided benefit to the species that the desired characters (i.e., the productive characters of our live stock) be transmitted in a recessive manner. At present they most decidedly are not. Is it possible that just outside our sphere of knowledge there exists a mechanism for the evolution of recessivity ? But such an hypothesis as the evolution of recessivity demands systematized inbreeding for productivity. The outcome of the recently published work of twenty years' inbreeding by the United States Bureau of Dairy Industry [2] shows great possibilities in the direction of stabilizing a high yield (1,700 gallons) by this method. Success in inbreeding demands, however, a certain knowledge of the mode of inheritance of the character and particularly if sex-linkage is operat- ing. Here is a further reason for research both pure and applied. The demands of the market are not stable. The consumer of agricultural produce is282 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III British farmer has no control. Unless we have fundamental knowledge concern- ing the inheritance of the characteristics of the lactation, we need not hope to be able to keep pace with market fluctuations. Pending adequate analysis of the problem, a continuance of existing selec- tion methods (with the re-enforcement of the recent remarkable rediscovery of the progeny test) is much to be desired and will, on the whole, give good results. When, as is bound to happen, there is a popular reaction to the progeny test THE INHERITANCE OF PRODUCTIVITY IN FARM LIVE STOCK. 283 REFERENCES 1. J. Mackintosh. The Progeny-Testing of Dairy Bulls.

THE INHERITANCE OF PRODUCTIVITY IN FARM LIVE STOCK III. BREEDING FOR EGG-PRODUCTION A. W. GREENWOOD (Institute of Animal Genetics, University of Edinburgh). Discussing the future possibilities for increasing egg-production in poultry, Jull [ 1 ] has stated that progress largely depends upon the poultry-breeder's ability to control heredity. Further, he suggests that " heredity can be con- trolled and directed best only when the knowledge of poultry-breeders develops sufficiently to enable them to select breeding stock that will transmit to their offspring the most desirable qualities. Selection is the keynote in the programme of future development." Selection without an exact knowledge of the mode of hereditary transmission of desirable qualities, but with a belief that they are transmissible from parent to offspring, has been the basis of all breeding practices in the past. It has been responsible, together with improvements in husbandry, for the tremendous in- crease in the production records of our modern domesticated breeds when com- pared with the ancestral types from which they have sprung. Such advance bears witness to the importance of heredity. In attempting to assess the possible value of the science of genetics to the cause of increased fecundity in poultry, we should begin by considering the results that are now obtainable when selection along certain definite lines is practised. An examination of the production figures at egg-laying contests testified to the skill of the intelligent breeder in developing highly fecund strains of birds. His methods of selection, however, when improved flocks are dealt with lead to negli- gible progress over a fairly long period of time. This has been demonstrated by Dunn [ 2 ] from an analysis of egg-laying contest figures in America. Over a period of nine years he found that there was little material change in average egg-production. This is very significant. Since only a small percentage of a flock of birds is rigorously selected by certain standards for participation in egg- laying trials, it follows that the results obtained represent practically the highest individual performances possible with the methods of selection now used by breeders. The production of the flock as a whole, however, usually falls far short of these individual records, and perhaps the most pressing question to be faced from the economic stand-point is that of devising a means of raising the figure for average production, even in the most improved flocks. The problem of improving egg-yield by breeding has been the incentive to much scientific work, which has taken the form of analytical attempts to define and measure the desirable qualities that a hen should possess in order (284)
THE INHERITANCE OF PRODUCTIVITY IN FARM LIVE STOCK. 285 that maximum production may be attained. From observation and experiment Goodale and Sanborn [ 3 ] conclude that there are, at least, five desirable qualities which, if present in a bird, lead to high annual production. These are :286 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III Recorded observations of many workers have shown that quick-maturing pullets tend to make the highest annual records, and this emphasizes the necessity for considering early sexual maturity when increased records are desired. These five qualities are, perhaps, obvious ones to select for, if an increase in egg-yield is desired ; it will be interesting to see what amount of improvement may be obtained in a relatively unimproved flock by continuous selection along these lines. Fortunately, the results of two separate experiments are available, one carried out by Marble and Hall [ 4 ] and the other begun by Goodale and con- tinued by Hays and Sanborn [5] (Table I). TABLE I Marble and Hall, 1930 . . . . Goodale, Hays and Sanborn, 1934. Leghorns . . . . . . Rhode Island Reds. Average production increased from 118 to 196 eggs . . . . . Average production increased from 134 to 222 eggs. Percentage increase 66.1 . . . Percentage increase 65. 6. It is not suggested that such a rate of improvement could be obtained in the best flocks by means of selection based on the five qualities outlined above, because in all probability the higher averages produced now-a-days have resulted from an unconscious use of these qualities as a basis of selection over a compara- tively long period of years. Both experiments started with birds that did not give a very high average egg-yield, and continuous selection for increased egg- production was maintained over a period of twenty years. The results obtained in both sets of experiments showed a remarkable similarity in the amount of increase in the average yield, and this is the more striking when it is considered that not only were different breeds used, but that the initial egg-production of the two flocks was also different. From these experiments it is possible to deduce that the methods employed are along the right lines but the question has still to be faced as to what is the final degree of improvement in egg-yield that may be obtained by these methods. From an analysis of their flock records for the years 1928 to 1932, Hays and Sanborn [ 5 ] show that whereas, over 50 per cent of their birds exhibited three or four of the desirable characteristics, and 16 per cent all five of them (Table II), this improvement was only about one-sixth of that theoretically anticipated, for there is no known reason why all the birds cannot carry all five desirable charac- teristics.

Early sexual maturity apparently depends on two independent dominant genes, either of which can produce, for example, the onset of egg-laying in the Rhode Island Red breed before the hens are 215 days old. One of these genes is sex-linked, the other autosomal (Eo and E'E'). For high intensity of production, also, two dominant genes are necessary (II and I'I'). Hens carrying gene 1 have alone an average winter-clutch size greater than 2, but less than 2.6. Gene 1' gives a clutch size of about 2.6. Both genes together increase the clutch size up to 3 or more eggs throughout the winter season. Both genes are autosomal and cumulative in effect. For winter pause there seems to be only one dominant gene, M. Desirable birds therefore carry the recessive form, mm. Broodiness has been found to be inherited on a two-factor basis. Two dominant complementary genes, A and C, are necessary to produce it. There is no evidence of sex-linkage and non-broody birds are of three general classes : (1) those lacking both A and C ; (2) those carrying A and lacking C ; and (3) those carrying C and lacking A. The latter two classes make it evident why broodiness is so difficult to eliminate completely from a flock, since females of these con- stitutions, though not exhibiting broodiness themselves, will produce broody offspring if mated to males carrying the complementary gene they lack. The data for persistency indicate that it is inherited on the basis of a single dominant autosomal gene, P. L
288 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III So far as experimental work has shown, the ideal hen should have a genetic constitution with regard to the desirable characters leading to high egg-produc- tion, as follows : Eo, E'E', II, I'I', mm aacc, PP. It will readily be seen why progress by methods of selection is apt to be extremely slow, for there are possible in a flock, 65,496 * genetically different classes of birds with regard to the five characters involved, and only one of these would give fixity of type. Again, since five of the eight genes, from which these characters originate, are dominants, distinctions between their heterozygous and homozygous forms are small, and at present apparently undetected, so that if, as must occasionally occur, a hen homozygous for all the desirable qualities should arise, the chances of its being recognized as such are extremely small. In the case of the male, the difficulties are further increased by the fact that, though for true-breeding stock he must carry the desired characters in the homozygous form, yet he cannot in himself exhibit them. It can well be imagined then that the chances of producing a strain with constant genetical constitution is extremely remote when selection methods alone are practised; and it is indeed doubtful whether much further progress would be made in the best flocks, although considerable progress is possible in un- improved stock. If we refer back to the original statements of Jull that ' the possibility of increasing egg-production depends on the poultry breeder's ability to control heredity ', and ' that selection is the keynote in the programme of future develop- ment ', a certain amount of confusion arises. Even with the knowledge of the mode of inheritance of the necessary qualities leading to high annual egg-produc- tion, it cannot be said that a policy of selection along these lines owes anything to the fact that a genetical analysis has been made. In fact, it may be said that ignorance of the genetical work should produce about the same amount of im- provement in a flock, because the qualities selected for are just those which, if inherited, would tend to increase production. So far, the service of genetics has been to prove what has hitherto been a belief, viz., that certain desirable qualities are inherited in a definite and orderly manner. Unless we are to agree with Babcock and Clauson [ 6 ] that the real service of genetics to animal breeding lies in promoting clarity of thought, the geneticist must show how the knowledge gained by experiment can best be used to improve existing breeding practices. In this particular field he must show the breeder how he can control heredity. * This figure is taken from Hays' publication but is obviously incorrect. The number of genetical classes possible when dealing with eight genes, only one of which is sex-linked, would be 4,374 when females alone are considered, and 6,561 if males are considered: a total of 10,935.
THE INHERITANCE OF PRODUCTIVITY IN FARM LIVE STOCK. 289 The real limitation of selection lies in the fact that, owing to the apparent similarity of production of the homozygous and heterozygous gene groupings, it is impossible to forecast with accuracy the productive capacity of all offspring from any mating. To illustrate this with regard to one particular quality, say persistency, making use of genetical knowledge, let us suppose that only females showing persistency were selected as breeders ; they would have either the genetic constitution PP or Pp. There could be no evidence from the male himself as to his genetic constitution, and so, from matings with persistent females, there are three groups, each of two classes, into which his resultant progeny might fall (Table III). TABLE III Parents Offspring Group 1290 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III On the other hand, should this information be unattainable, that is, supposing measurable differences in egg-production cannot be found between hetero- and homo-zygous forms, the geneticist still has a method of attack that would even- tually lead to the analysis of the genetical constitution of any bird. In the first place, it would be necessary to build up a stock containing all the homozygous recessive forms of the characters to be investigated. This could be done by selec- tion much more easily than by the reverse process. The value of selecting for recessive characters is well illustrated by the results of selection against broodi- ness ; this has been almost completely eliminated from many breeds of fowl, and even in breeds like the Rhode Island Red, where broodiness is of common occur- rence, the value of selection against it is shown in the figures of Hays and Sanborn, where the percentage of birds exhibiting this characteristic phenomenon dropped from 86 in 1916 to 12 in 1932. Theoretically then, the building up of a strain of birds homozygous for the recessive characters should not offer great difficulty. Such birds would have the following genetical constitution with regard to the characters selected against: eo, e'e', ii, i'i', pp, aa cc, (late maturity, low intensity, low persistency of production and non-broodiness). The only character of the group that would offer any difficulty would be winter pause, which depends on a single dominant gene. The recessive homozygous form could not be expressed in such a strain of birds because of the activity of the other genes selected to give minimum production ; this hindrance could be overcome, however, by first of all fixing this character in the stock from which the homozygous recessive strain would subsequently be developed. Having once obtained such a strain of birds, it would be possible to determine accurately, and well within the productive life of the bird, the genetical constitu- tion of any male or female, by means of matings with the recessive stock. The desirable qualities, which combine to produce high egg-yield, are most probably dependent on the same genes in the different varieties of the domestic fowl, so that, it would not be necessary to obtain testing strains for all the different breeds of fowl. Before closing this discussion of the inheritance of egg-production, it is neces- sary to emphasize the fact that the survey of the problem has been made from the simplest possible genetical angle. We have dealt only with the behaviour of certain inherited characters without suggesting factors that might intervene to complicate breeding practice, and so we have omitted to stress the important rôle played by environment and its effect on the expression of the gene. It is obvious, however, that this type of reaction also falls within the province of the geneticistTHE INHERITANCE OF PRODUCTIVITY IN FARM LIVE STOCK. 291 of an animal are to be expressed. Apart from nutrition, perhaps the most striking effect on egg-production derived from control of extraneous environmental in- fluence is that which follows increased exposure to light. Just as we have a measure of the intensity of inheritance from observations on parent and offspring in breeding practice, so to determine quantitative effects of environmental factors on gene expression, it is necessary to have stock whose genetical constitution is known. There is yet another phase of genetical inquiry that may perhaps be con- sidered of mainly academic interest, but from which we now have indications that it may lead shortly to more practical and less tedious methods of controlling heredity than that outlines earlier in this paper.

THE INHERITANCE OF PRODUCTIVITY IN FARM LIVE STOCK IV. WOOL J. E. NICHOLS (Wool Industries Research Association) The general title of these papers suggests a wider field for consideration than that simply of the inheritance of wool-characters, which has been reviewed recently by Miller [1]. In the first place, it is to be remembered that the fleece, as a covering during life, contributes to the hardiness of the animal in its ability to survive the rigours and changes of environment, and is, therefore, concerned in the other activities of the sheep, for meat-production, for breeding surplus stock, in some countries for milk, and so on. It is an agent, though indirect, in promoting the efficiency of the sheep as a producer of those commodities which the sheep-breeder hopes will be profitable to him. Herein it gives rise to problems in productivity rather remote from those occurring in the other animal products dealt with in these articles. Fibre-growth is a more intimate function of the sheep's activity than is, say, milk-production of the cow's and egg-production of the hen's. It begins in early foetal life and ends only at death. There would thus appear to be three different primary sets of environmental conditions to which it is exposed, viz. (1) the rela- tively constant foetal environment, during which, however, the follicles inter se are affected by the sequence and density of their development [2], (2) the early post- natal, representing a change in life-habit towards (3) the post-weaning, quite independent life, in which the animal attains maturity, becomes a functional ruminant, and so exposed to all the exigencies of nutritional environment inciden- tal to free-grazing animals. The changes that occur with general development are obvious in many breeds. Many Merino lambs are born hairy; the birth-coat hairs are shed or lost, and leave the growing lamb with a fleece of practically pure wool. The lambs of some of our Down breeds, especially the Suffolk, are more or less darkly coloured at birth; by shedding and replacement, the relatively pigment-free adult coat is acquired; from maturity onwards we find other changes in fleece character. Recent work on time or age changes, from birth to maturity is pervaded with the idea that definite relationships exist between natal and adult coats, and that selection for desirable adult fleece-characters can be exercised early in life [3]. It is clear that not only is the follicle-population variable in time, but also the forms of the fibre-product are alterable. (294)
THE INHERITANCE OF PRODUCTIVITY IN FARM LIVE STOCK. 295 Throughout the adolescent and mature phases the changes in fleece-growth that can follow alterations in nutritional level are very varied, and may be of some magnitude. For example, in one case, which has been studied, of an Australian Merino fleece, it was estimated that in terms of average fibre-volume per month, the rate of production suddenly accelerated by over 100 per cent at one period of the year [4]; and the wool-fibres are not the only products of the skin-and-follicle system which make up the growing fleece [5]. But so far as wool-productivity is concerned, we are mainly involved in consi- dering wool as an annual crop of some direct value to the farmer. For the most part its course to the real consumer is peculiarly tortuous and prolonged, and through the innumerable mixings which occur the individual fleece loses all its identity. The cash value of the wool crop to the farmer is ordinarily some func- tion of the weight of the raw wool, the proportion of grease and other non-wool materials in the raw fleeces, and the estimated fitness of the amount of actual pure wool present for particular manufacturing purposes. These three factors are very variable, from one animal to another, from flock to flock between different breeds, and according to locality and husbandry. Moreover, when the wool-using industry is viewed, as a whole, it is readily appreciable that absolute uniformity of the supply of raw material is not desirable of the inherent attributes of the wool-fibres in the fleece which affect its manufacturing utility, length, soundness, 'quality' or fineness, uniformity, fineness to its particular type or breed, and general character, may be mentioned, but of these only length and fineness are readily measurable, and have, therefore, been studied most. The most useful combination of these characters from the manufacturer's point of view is not necessarily that which the farmer would consider optimal, quite apart from other attributes of the fleece with which the latter is concerned. For example, fleece-density, in part contributory to fleece-weight, is of more direct interest to the breeder than to the user, in so far as it is involved in the rain- coating action of the fleece. Yet it is apparently not always dissociable from the length-fineness complex. In view of such interrelations, it is perhaps not surprising that the majority of investigators conclude that apart from questions of colour, the inheritance of most fleece-characters is dependent upon multiple factors. Apparently conflicting results have, however, been noted. For example, whilst Hill [6] found the F1 intermediate in wool-fineness in Hampshire-Ram~ bouillet crosses, Davenport and Ritzman [7] noted that the F1 approached the coarser-wooled Hampshire parental type; yet these investigators also describe intermediate F1s in crosses involving South-down and Oxford rams and Ram- bouillet ewes with a tendency to approach the finer-wooled parent. At the same time, they record in the Oxford cross an F1 wool-length type, whilst in the South- down and Hampshire crosses, the F1 had longer wool than either parental form.

296 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III indicate partial dominance of the longer wool, but if amount of fibre (i.e. volume) is considered, then these conclusions may have to be modified, since in this cross the F2 average fibre-volumes tend to swing towards the Cheviot parental type rather than the Border Leicester [8]. If we admit that multiple-factor systems determine fleece-character inherit- ance, two important considerations arise. The first is the apparent futility of searching for single genetic factors which may override or profoundly affect the fleece-complex of wool characters. Miller [1] has raised this point, but re-emphasis is not out of place. The second concerns methods and degrees of selection. The suggestion can be made that some of the divergent results of investigations are explicable on the grounds that one parental form has been selected more rigorously, or is less heterozygous, for one particular fleece-character and exhibits a degree of prepotency, just as in ordinary breeding practice appear strains or individuals decidedly impressive. Conceivably, such an interpretation may be applicable, for example, in the first and second generations of the Border Leicester-Cheviot cross, which show bimodal frequency distributions of fibre-length similar to those found in the Border Leicester [8]. Selection for wool-productivity is in practice pursued within the single breed or flock ; in ordinary husbandry its objects are generally to reduce the variability of fibre-character on each animal and from one animal to another, i.e. within the flock or breed, as well as to improve performance in some desired directions, such as greater density, higher fleece-weight, better yield or longer staple. Outstand- ing examples of the progress of such selection are to be found among the ' stud ' Merino flocks, and from them we can draw conclusions, not only as to the methods of improvement, but also as to the ways in which the geneticist may accompany the practical breeder. In multiple-factor situations, the phenotype closely reflects the genotype. In the stud flocks, we find that whereas first selection may be phenotypic, the progeny test is widely applied, and the method of breeding involves a progressive infiltration of a genotype throughout part of the flock. Thus, briefly, a stud ram will be mated to a few selected stud ewes, some of his ram offspring will be mated to other stud ewes, and so on, until, when proved, his influence can be applied where necessary in the flock. Even in the larger commercial flocks, some selected ewes are retained almost solely for use with introduced rams, to breed rams for general service, forming a ram-testing and breeding flock within the main flock. But the function of the studs, or pedigree flocks, is to supply so-called ' flock rams' for use elsewhere, which means, in many different environments. The breeders realize the importance of the extra-ordinary effects of environment on the animal and its fleece; hence a certain variability of genotype is deliberately maintained so that the different demands for flock rams may be met. To this end the variability is kept possibly relatively greater among the top stud animals than among the flock ewes.
THE INHERITANCE OF PRODUCTIVITY IN FARM LIVE STOCK. 297 But in surveying the wool-producing countries, one cannot help being impressed by the remarkable way in which certain localities are pre-eminent for selection and improvement, constituting in effect centres for the breed from which emanate stock for commercial use in other areas. The type most successfully or most readily developed in one breeding centre is, however, not necessarily very like that from another. Further, they do not perforce react in precisely the same way when transported to yet another environment. A few instances from the many may be quoted. In the British Isles, is a multiplicity of breeds, almost every one possessing a territory within which it either predominates or produces stock for crossing, and there are also local varia- tions in type of practical importance. In Australia, among the Merinos, are the South Australian, the Riverina, and other New South Wales forms of strong wools; stocks of strong or medium wool origin exhibit different characters when pastured in fine wool areas, whlist among the fine wools, distinction can be made, for example, between the Tasmanian, Victorian, and New South Wales types. Parts of the Karroo areas in South Africa form fountain heads of improved breeding stock for use in other regions of the Union, and in New Zealand, among the Romneys, different localities apparently demand different strains. In all cases it is, or should be, the general balance of fleece-characters that is borne in mind. Only a few days ago, discussion with a New Zealand breeder revealed that he had been attempting to increase his fleece-weights by selecting for greater staple-length, but he had found that at a certain stage the wool suffered by the tips of the staples becoming more weathered and wasted. Thus, it was better to sacrifice the extra length and weight for soundness throughout the staple. All these considerations add force to the principle that the pre-requisite for selection is that environment which allows the clearest expression of genotype. In the field of wool-productivity, to aid in the recognition of genotype and to gain accurate knowledge of phenotype to which it gives rise in other environments, are objectives which the zoologist may well pursue.

THE INHERITANCE OF PRODUCTIVITY IN FARM LIVE STOCK V. DISCUSSION OF PRECEDING CONTRIBUTIONS J. L. LUSH (Iowa State College, Ames, Iowa, U. S. A.) Clarity may be served by discussing these four papers from two stand-points: firstly, the inheritance of productivity as a scientific fact, or series of interrelated facts, and secondly the methods of using those facts and interrelations most efficiently to advance the aims of animal breeders. Efficient application of funda- mental knowledge to the solution of present problems may not automatically follow the discovery of that knowledge. Research in methods of application may be quite as necessary as research in discovery of the principles themselves. So far as concerns the inheritance, each paper has stressed the complexity of the topic. It seems certain that for each trait there are many genes involved. No doubt these genes interact with each other and with the environment in many ways besides the simple additive way that may be expressed most readily in gene- ralized formulae. Each paper has also stressed the necessity for keeping the animals in an envi- ronment that would permit differences in productivity to develop, although the philosophical explanation for this necessity varies among the speakers. Dr. Hammond holds that the genes change adaptively in direct response to the environ- ment, whereas most of us hold that such gene-changes have not been demonstrated experimentally, even by the many experiments expressly intended to find them, and, moreover, are not necessary to explain the facts, either of animal breeding or of evolution. Hence, we would argue that there is no necessity for invoking such a supposed direct effect of environment of genes, even as a working hypothesis. The necessity for keeping animals under an environment that will permit them to show their differences in productivity, arises from the fact that conscious selec- tion for such differences is possible only when and as far as such differences are permitted to develop to a recognizable degree. The sharp line which Dr. Hammond proposes between ' developmental' and ' mutational' characteristics will not, I think, be accepted as valid by many workers, either in animal breeding or in more classical branches of biology. Most of us would hold that all characteristics are developmental, depending for their full expression upon the interactions of the genes with each other and with environ- ment as well. From this standpoint, highly hereditary characteristics are those in which most of the variance we ordinarily see, is due to differences in the genes (298)
THE INHERITANCE OF PRODUCTIVITY IN FARM LIVE STOCK. 299 which different individuals have, whilst faintly hereditary characteristics are those in which most of the variance ordinarily occurring is due to differences in environ- ment to which different individuals have been exposed. Characteristics may further be classified according to whether the hereditary portion of the variance is due to few factors and shows sharply discontinuous classification, or many genes are involved and yield a practically continuous series of phenotypes. From this standpoint the differences between highly hereditary and slightly hereditary, or between continuous and discontinuous, characteristics, although highly im- portant practically, involve no differences in fundamental principles, but only differences in the number of genes involved, or in the proportions of the total observed variance resulting from genetic differences and from environmental differences. So much for the fundamental facts concerning the inheritance of productivity. Before applying those facts to breed higher productivity into a breed or strain of animals, as an engineer would apply the fundamental principles of physics and mechanics to such a task as the building of a bridge, measurements are needed of the magnitude of the forces involved, just as the engineer would need measure- ments of the loads his bridge was expected to carry, the amount and seasonal distribution of the water-flow which must move down the stream under it, the number of years before it is expected to become obsolete, the amount of money available for construction, etc. I venture the opinion that, in general, this is the least explored field of applied genetics, and that neglect to measure and integrate properly these variables is the major cause for the mistakes and unsound proposals that are sometimes made even by those whose knowledge of biological fundamen- tals is not seriously deficient. It will not have escaped notice that all four speakers have mentioned selection as a first step in breeding for productivity, although they differ considerably in their optimism as to its sufficiency. I would here call attention to only two aspects of the question of how intense selection can be, even in the idealized case where the man doing the selecting is possessed of complete knowledge of the genotypes of his animals. The first is that natural fertility and longevity set serious limits to the intensity of the selection which may be practised. Each parent must even- tually be replaced by another, even in a population static in size. What propor- tion of the female offspring must be saved for replacements ? What proportion of the males ? Here is a whole field of what we might call' the vital statistics of farm animals which is as yet only slightly explored. In dairy cattle, about 50 to 60 per cent of the heifers must be saved, merely to replace their dams, which are being lost by disability, old age, and other causes of death. In swine, perhaps 10 per cent of the gilts would be enough ; perhaps 7 or 8 per cent would be enough for exceptionally well-managed herds. In chickens, perhaps 2 per cent of the eggs that might possibly be hatched into pullets would be enough for replacements. These figures set serious and varying limits to intensity of selection in the first place. One must begin with the material available. There is small use to talk
300 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III of the advantages of selecting breeding-stock homozygous for high productivity if less than 1 per cent of the population is of that genotype, and if one is forced by reproductive rates to save 10 or 50 per cent of the whole population for breeding. The second point concerning the intensity of selection is that such intensity is weakened (much more than is generally realized) by the inclusion of more and more items in the ideal; that is, by considering many different characteristics in making the selections. In the idealized case, where n independent, equally important characteristics are to be considered in the selections and x is the pro- portion of the population which must be saved for replacements, the selection intensity for each characteristic singly is the same as if the nth root of x were the proportion which must be saved. Thus, if one needs only to save one-tenth of the offspring, but pays equal attention to eight independent characteristics, the intensity of selection for each such characteristic is no greater than if attention has been paid to the characteristic alone, but it had been necessary to save three- fourths of all offspring born. This, I think, is the only general basis of real anta- gonism between breeding for production and breeding for ' fancy points ' namely, that each additional point considered must necessarily weaken the selection which might otherwise have been practised. Nevertheless, the practical breeder must pay attention to several things, even though he understands perfectly this weaken- ing effect. Besides estimating how intense his selections can actually be, one needs (if he is to estimate the outcome at all accurately) to know first what portion of the observed variance is genetic in the narrow sense, which includes only those gene- combination effects that can be expressed by some additive scheme ; second, what portion of the variance is due to gene-combination effects that cannot be expressed additively ; and third, what portion of the initial variance is purely environmental in origin. Of course such a division is not absolutely correct to the last detail, since in actual practice there will be interactions between the three kinds of variance. For instance, some genotypes may be more plastic to environmental influences than others. If that be the case, and if the breeding system increases the frequency of the more easily influenced genotypes, then the environmental portion of the variance will likewise increase, although the environment does not change. If extreme refinement is important, and if the necessary data are avail- able, a more detailed division may be made specifying how much variance is due to such interactions. However, in most practical problems, such refinements will usually produce but small gains compared with the considerable amount of approximation still remaining. Usually, the first approximation given by dividing the variance into the three parts named above will be sufficient for the purpose of practical application. Only the genetic variance that can be expressed additively is subject to simple mass selection. The refinements of selection methods, such as the progeny or the judicious use of pedigree information, serve mainly to reduce somewhat the errors
THE INHERITANCE OF PRODUCTIVITY IN FARM LIVE STOCK. 301 that are introduced by the other sources of variance. For instance, if one-third of the variance in milk-yield of a breed of dairy cows is genetic in this narrow sense of the word, and if the breeders pay no attention to bulls, but select the cows so intensively that those saved for breeding average 150 gallons more than their entire contemporary generation, one can expect the next generation to average 25 gallons above the generation in which their parents were born. When compared with the 150-gallon ' selection differential', the 25-gallon gain may appear disappointingly small. No doubt this explains the fact that in every country the voices of zealous enthusiasts are sometimes heard proclaiming that the old methods of selection and attention to pedigree are useless, but that the latest panacea of progeny test, sire index, or what not, will accomplish all that the old methods are condemned for not doing. In the example just quoted, the complete and exhaustive use of a progeny test for the selection of bulls, while still using the same standard of selection for the cows, could about double the rate of progress, the exact figure depending much upon what portion of the tested sires it is finally necessary to save for replacement pur- poses, and on what portion of the dams of the future breed are sired by bulls being tested, and what portion can be sired by bulls after they have been proven. Such a doubling of the rate of progress would be an achievement important enough to justify much enthusiasm for proven sires. Yet the point I wish to make here is that the difference is not between methods that are wholly right and methods that are wholly useless, but between methods of selection that use more or use less of the information which is available or might be made available for selecting. The difference is in degree more than in kind. Too often the old method is condemned because it does only what a more careful study and measurement would lead us to expect it to do, whilst a method heralded as new is, on account of its plausibility, extolled far beyond what we really have a right to expect of it. For further example : if the selection practised were only that of saving bulls from the high-producing cows, what has one a right to expect ? That is tanta- mount to predicting cows' yields from the yields of their paternal grandams, and one would expect such cows to exceed the average of what their generation would have yielded without selection, by an amount approximately equal to one-fourth of that fraction of the variance which is additively genetic, multiplied by the amount by which the paternal grandams' yield actually exceeded the average of their generation. Thus, with one-third of the variance genetic and a selection differen- tial of 150 gallons for the paternal grandams one would expect an increase of only about 12½ gallons in the grand-daughters. This might naturally seem almost no increase at all to those who had been led by innuendo to think that they had a right to expect in the grand-daughter an increase almost equal to the selection differential practised on the grandams. These calculations are crude and sketchy and do not include, for example, what may be expected when selection is practised simultaneously on dams and sires, grandams and grandsires, but naturally with varying intensities on each, and with
302 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III varying degrees of knowledge about each. These illustrations have been used to show what kinds of knowledge are needed,.and how one should proceed to make a business-like estimate of the probable gains to be derived from various methods of selection, progeny-testing, etc. Not until such a valid estimate is made, is one in a position to decide whether a given procedure is likely to provide gains that will more than offset its costs. In preparing these estimates, there is work in plenty to be done in measuring reproductive rates, selection differentials reasonably attainable, the genetic portion of the observed variance, etc. In addition to the genetic variance that can be expressed by an additive scheme, there is a portion (perhaps a very large portion in stocks that are already improved) of the variance which is genetic in a broad sense, but cannot be expressed additively because the gene combination interact in other ways. Such gene interactions include inhibitory, multiplicative, complementary and epistatic effects, and also what may be a very common class of cases where that which is optimum in the breeder's opinion is genetically intermediate. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] SCALE OF THICKNESS OF BACK FLESH. Diagram illustrating the case where the maximum of desirability may be produced by an intermediate combination of genes. In such a case selection usually produces noticeable results in the first few generations it is practised, but rather quickly approaches a limit beyond which progress is not made, although hereditary variability still remains. Further progress can often be made if some combination of inbreeding and outbreeding is practised along with continued selection.
THE INHERITANCE OF PRODUCTIVITY IN FARM LIVE STOCK 303 For instance, in bacon swine too thick a back is as undesirable as a back too thin. Hence, although the genes affecting thickness of back might perhaps act additively in terms of linear measurements to make the back thicker or thinner, yet they would not act additively when measured on the scale of how much more or less desirable they make the bacon carcass. That is illustrated schematically in the accompany- ing diagram. Another example, outwardly different but the same in principle, may be furnished by dressing per cent in swine. Other things being equal, the higher the dressing per cent the more desirable the pig from the butcher's view point. From the grower's standpoint there must be some limit to this. The pig must have a certain weight and volume of digestive and other vital organs if it is to be healthy and thrifty. Hence, considering everything, the ideal pig in this respect will be something of a compromise between two partially irreconcilable ideas, having a dressing per cent somewhat lower than the butcher wishes but somewhat higher than the grower would wish if he could afford to disregard the butcher's desires. It is characteristic of such cases that the individual genes cannot be rated as either good or bad, since the directions of their effects are so dependent upon the combina- tion of other genes present. Hence selection is for or against gene combinations as such, rather than for or against the constituent genes of those combinations. On the other hand, the mechanism of inheritance is such that the genes and not the gene combinations are the units of inheritance. The problem presented by such variance can be solved by the use of inbreed- ing to differentiate the stock into genetically distinct strains or families, with rare outcrosses between such families to restore the variance and make new combina- tions possible. Such a differentiation into lines should permit inter-family selec- tion, which would be more effective than individual selection. However, the proper balance to be maintained between the intensity of inbreeding, frequency of outcrossing, and intensity of individual and family selections, in order to promote the maximum rate of progress, offers a whole series of problems, the complete solution of which may well vary from case to case and require continued research for years to come on a scale not yet approached in any country. In summary, then, we are agreed that inheritance is complex, and that each trait must be studied for itself from several points of view. We are also agreed that the first practical step in breeding is selection under an environment which will permit the genetic differences between individuals to manifest themselves as definitely as possible. We are agreed that progeny tests and, at least, a little initial attention to pedigree are quite helpful. We are not agreed as to the relative amounts of attention that should be given to individual performance, pedigree, and progeny test. We are agreed that it is desirable (as Mr. Smith especially has emphasized) to control environment as much as possible, so as not to be misled by it when making selections, but we differ in our optimism as to how complete control can be in actual practice. We are not entirely agreed as to the gains that N
304 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III will accrue from a complete and detailed knowledge of the technical genetic situa- tion in each case. We are far from agreeing on the importance which inbreeding and outcrossing should receive in breeding for productivity. I hope that such discussion as this, which of itself solves no problems, may nevertheless contribute to their solution by formulating them more clearly and particularly by presenting to our colleagues in more classical branches of biology some view of the nature and complexity of the problems that are still unanswered. Measurement looms large in such problems. This explains the importance of quantitative methods in applied genetics.

In two of the experimental healthy cows, the calcium content was found to decrease and the phosphoric acid content to increase. Further in order to compensate for the loss of blood in the urine, a quantity of blood from a healthy cow was given intravenously to an affected animal but no amelioration resulted. At autopsy of experimental animals, lesions of tuber- culosis have been recorded from most animals but no explanation for this unusual finding has been offered. In the small animal tests, 4 white mice, 3 guinea pigs and 2 rabbits were inoculated with 1, 2 and 5 c.c. of strongly bloody urine at the root of the tail but no reaction was noticed in life or on destruction. From the above experiments and the failure to find any parasites in the post mortem examination of clinically affected cases, the author concludes that the disease is not transmissible, is not contagious or infectious, and no parasite is involved in its causation. Again to test whether any general poisoning through acids can set up haematuria, commercial acids and spring water from notorious localities were tested experimentally, by administration to healthy animals in such high proportions as neither the fodder nor the water of enzootic areas could possibly contain remembering of course that even if such concentrations were possible in nature, cattle would surely refuse to take them. Increasing doses and varying concentrations of nitric acid (up to 65 c.c. of 0.17 to 0.39 per cent solutions), silicic acid (solution containing up to 50 grms. of Potassium silicate in 0.29 to 1.06 per cent solution) and Oxalic acid (170 grms. of Oxalic acid in 0.2 to 2.43 per cent solution) were given in drinking water over a length of time. No changes were noticed in any of the animals. On the basis of these experi- ments, the author concludes that these common acids do not cause haematuria in living animals, and that the water from enzootic areas does not contain any virus or bacteria capable of transmitting the disease.

During 1934, the authors successfully used Acaprine in the treatment of twelve bovines, the majority of which showed very severe symptoms of Babesia bigemina infection. The protocols of three of these animals are given and from these it would appear that in all cases a marked amelioration of the clinical symptoms resulted within 24 hours of drug injection. Four other animals, which were in a highly advanced stage of the disease and were lying down on the ground, died within 2 to 4 hours of drug intervention. During 1935, the authors treated fourteen further animals showing inappetence, an icteric condition of the mucous membranes and symptoms of haemo- globinuria, and recovery was obtained in nine of these animals as the result of a single injection of Acaprine.

The drug is also contra-indicated when there are symptoms of acute intestinal disturbance present, such as haemorrhagic enteritis. The dosage recommended is 2 c.c. of a 5 per cent solution of the drug per 100 kg. (220 lbs.) bodyweight, administered by the intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous route. [S. K.

CXI, 905308 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, III of growth and in the bovine species it is just between the 5th and 7th month of gesta- tion that the growth rate attains its maximum. At this period, in those cases of moderate deficiency, the supply of vitamin-E falls far short of the requirements of the foetus. Alterations are produced in the foetal tissue which permit Br. abortus to localise and cause lesions that lead to abortion. When the deficiency in vitamin-E is still less, abortion does no longer take place, but the new-born calves soon become victims of pyosepticaemia. The explanation for this lies in the fact that the lesions caused by Br. abortus, although not extensive enough to cause abortion, are nevertheless, sufficient to break the placental barriers permitting the infection of the foetus with coli and paracoli of maternal origin. This infection breaks out into a septicaemia a little time after birth when the calf is no longer defended by the antibodies of the mother. The retention of the placenta is considered to be due to a slight deficiency in vitamin-E which does not permit the invader to cause anything more than a slow inflammatory process and this is said to bring about adhesions with the cotyledons. The factor E is a fat soluble vitamin, the chemical composition of which is still undetermined. It exists in the sprouts of the graminaceous seeds. From the seeds it passes into the young plant and when these plants come to bear seeds, no trace of the vitamin is left in them. Soil, moisture and atmospheric factors may influence the formation of vitamin-E in the plant. This vitamin is thermostable but is rapidly destroyed by oxidation. The best form of artificially administering it is as an oil expressed from the sprouts of graminaceous seeds. Animals usually refuse to consume the hard seeds and the young plant is, therefore, the only source of vitamin-E available for them. Incidentally it is mentioned that abortions are not noticed during the spring and the summer when animals get plenty of green fodder. Vitamin-E is excreted through the milk, so the need for this factor is much more in animals that are intensely bred for the yield of milk. It is claimed that abortion is amenable to treatment based on these assumptions. The treatment consists of three subcutaneous injections of 30 to 40 c.c. each of wheat- germ oil, the first to be injected at the time of service, the second at the end of three months and the third at the end of six. The dosage may require to be increased in regions where the natural deficiency is great. When the dosage is correctly estimated success is complete. It is also emphasised that the treatment is one of prevention and not one of cure. For the treatment to be effective the first injection ought to be given at the time of service. The author treated 7,000 cows on the basis of the principles already enumerated, and the claim is made that in all those cases in which proper precautions had been taken as regards dosage and time of intervention, the treatment, whether for abor- tion, retention or mortality of the new-born was invariably attended with successful results.

GANAPATHY IYER, G.M.V.C., Veterinary Inspector, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar [Received for publication on 14th May, 1936] (With Plates XX & XXI) INTRODUCTION Fowl-pox is a contagious disease of birds due to a filtrable virus and is characterised by the appearance of wart-like nodules on the head and cheesy diphtheritic membranes in the buccal cavity with or without oculo-nasal discharge. One or all of the above lesions may be present in the same bird. At the instigation of this Institute in 1934, specimens in the form of dried crusts from suspected cases of fowl-pox, have been received from various parts of India for confirmation, and this has enabled the writers to study the disease. As detailed in Table I, so far 22 specimens have been received, out of which 15 were found positive to fowl-pox, and of these, three received from the Madras Presidency gave rise to the development of diphtheritic lesions in the buccal cavity in addition to the cutaneous lesions, on subinoculation over the feather follicles of healthy fowls. Advantage was taken of this opportunity to study this diphtheritic condition in some detail. A review of the past literature shows that the nomenclature of this disease has been rather confusing. Each lesion appears to have been named separately and amongst other names we have chicken-pox, contagious epithelioma, canker, avian diphtheria, and roup, although it is now known that these conditions are only different manifestations of the same disease determined by one and the same virus. (313)
314 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, IV While studying the diphtheritic form Moore [1885], Marshall [1900] and Jackley [1918] were of opinion that bacteria might be the cause but could not confirm their identity. Jowett [1909] stated that comb and mouth lesions were etiologically distinct. Ward [1904] was the first to relate roup etiologically to chicken-pox. Haring and Kofoid [1911] demonstrated cell inclusions of chicken- pox in the cheese-like lesions of the mouth and throat of fowls. Hadley and Beach [1913] believed that the head and mouth forms were different manifesta- tions of the same disease. Mack and Records [1915] showed evidence that chicken- pox and avian diphtheria were etiologically identical but did not draw positive conclusions. Arloing [1911-12] differentiated false and true fowl-pox diphtheria by histological methods. Jackley [loc. cit.] while studying roup, incriminated an organism of the Pasteurella group. Beach, Lothe and Halpin [1915] showed in an outbreak of chicken-pox and avian diphtheria that the high mortality was due to secondary invading bacteria although the primary cause was a filtrable virus. From the study of Brumley and Snook [1916] it seems that although there is a virus and complicating conditions induced by secondary bacterial infection, neither factor alone would cause a typical disease. Doyle and Minett [1927] studied the identity of wart-like growths on the head and diphtheritic lesions in the mouth and confirmed that comb and mouth lesions in the case of fowl-pox were due to the same virus and immunity to one form could be set up with material from another form. There was no evidence that bacteria alone could produce typical mouth lesions, the primary action of the specific virus being essential. PURPOSE OF EXPERIMENTS Experiments have been conducted to study the transmissibility of the virus of the diphtheritic lesions, its tendency for generalization, its etiological identity with the ordinary cutaneous form of fowl-pox as commonly found in India, filtra- bility of the causative virus and its immunological identity with our stock fowl- pox virus, which was obtained through the courtesy of the Veterinary Laboratory of the Ministry of Agriculture, Weybridge, England. METHOD OF EXPERIMENTAL TRANSMISSION A specimen of crusts was powdered and a 1 per cent emulsion was made after the method of Doyle and Minett [loc. cit.] with a slight modification that instead of ordinary saline, 80 per cent glycerinated saline was used in its prepara- tion. The inoculum thus prepared was applied by means of a swab over a scari- fied portion of the comb in the case of cocks, and in other birds over the feather follicles of the leg after pulling out a few feathers. Two healthy fowls and a fowl immune to our stock fowl-pox virus (Weybridge strain) were used for each specimen and the results were reported after a fortnight's observation from the
DIPHTHERITIC FORM OF FOWL-POX IN INDIA 315 date of inoculation, except in the case of negative results, when the fowls were subjected to an immunity test with the stock virus to exclude the possibility of their having a natural immunity to fowl-pox. In no case, except for the special purposes recorded in this paper, was direct inoculation ever done over the broken or unbroken mucous membrane of the mouth. All the specimens which were received from outside were subjected to biolo- gical test, for evidence of fowl-pox infection, in the manner described above, with the following results :316 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, IV TABLE IInd.

DIPHTHERITIC FORM OF FOWL-POX IN INDIA 317 Two more specimens (Nos. 429/1935 and 193/1936) were received which on biological test also gave rise to the development of the buccal form of the disease in addition to localisation over the feather follicles of the inoculated leg in healthy fowls, whereas the immune fowls did not react. In neither of the above cases was the virus emulsion applied in the mouth but on the leg only. From the above tests it is confirmed that the etiology of the mouth form and the cutaneous form is one and the same, and the virus in the above cases has produced the mouth form without any direct inoculation into the buccal mucous membrane. In other words it seems that the above samples of crusts on subinoculation into healthy fowls induced a reaction of a greater severity and probably caused generalisation of the disease.

318 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, IV From Table II it will be observed that inoculation of the leg alone in the case of fowl No. 255 gave rise to the lesions in the mouth in addition to the localisation over the feather follicles of the leg, giving a suggestion of generalisa- tion of the virus in the body of the fowl (Plate XXI). Fowl No. 256 which was inoculated over the scarified buccal mucous membrane showed the develop- ment of lesions only in the mouth and not in any other part of the body where all the feathers were intact (Plate XX, Fig. 2). This is in accord with the findings of Doyle and Minett [loc. cit.] who failed to infect a fowl's leg from which feathers had not been plucked. Two fowls Nos. 303 and 304 were subinoculated with the virus in the mouth on 15th November 1935 (Table II), and at the same time feathers were plucked from the leg but no application of the virus was done on that site in either case. Both died after a week showing severe diphtheritic lesions in the buccal cavity, but without showing any lesion over the plucked area. The severe mouth lesions apparently caused the death of the birds too quickly to allow the cutaneous lesions to develop through generalisation. Two fowls were scarified in the mouth with a sterile scalpel but no virus was inoculated. No lesions were observed in the mouth in either case, indicating that the micro-organisms normally inhabiting the buccal cavity of fowls were not able to produce the diphtheritic lesions without the presence of fowl-pox virus. VIABILITY OF THE VIRUS IN FILTRATES Material for filtration was obtained from the buccal lesions of two fowls and cutaneous lesions of fowl No. 255, in which the lesions were produced from the same original diphtheritic buccal material of fowl No. 228. The material was gently removed with sterile forceps, and, after a mild wash in normal saline solution, was pulped and emulsified with the same solution to make a 1 per cent emulsion. The emulsion was left at room temperature before filtration for twenty minutes for autolysis to take place. Filtrates were obtained through Cham- berland L. 3, Berkefeld ' V ' and Berkefeld ' N '. Every precaution was taken to avoid leakage and contamination during the process of filtration. Healthy fowls were inoculated with the filtrates, as detailed below in Table III and were subsequently put to immunity test with the stock virus, with the result that Berkefeld ' V ' filtrate was found to be viable whereas Chamberland L. 3 and Berkefeld ' N' filtrates were found to be sterile.

DISCUSSION From the results of the transmission experiments it is evident that the diph- theritic form of fowl-pox is also observed in India, besides the cutaneous form, and that the two forms are due to the same virus, which is immunologically indistinguishable from our stock Weybridge strain of this virus. Positive results with the Berkefeld ' V' filtrate of the material originally obtained from the buccal cavity of fowl No. 228, exhibiting the diphtheritic form of fowl-pox and inability of the micro-organisms normally inhabiting the buccal cavity of fowls to produce such lesions without the help of the virus, in spite of scarification, show that the above described lesions are due to a specific virus. With this particular strain of virus, buccal lesions developed almost invari- ably, in addition to the cutaneous lesions, even when the material was inoculated only on the feather follicles. But when the buccal cavity was inoculated with the material it killed the bird rather quickly and no distant cutaneous lesions were able to develop through generalisation, in spite of pulling out the feathers and thereby injuring the feather follicles. It was only in one case (fowl No. 256)
320 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, IV that the bird lived for about four weeks after the inoculation of the material in the buccal cavity, possibly due to varying individual susceptibility, but in that case the feathers had not been plucked and lesions were noticed only in the mouth. The explanation appears to be that unbroken skin does not take the virus from the body. Lesions of the oculo-nasal form of the disease were also observed in subsequent passages of the same virus. Doyle and Minett [loc. cit.] described the possibility of generalised symptoms being set up by inoculation of the virus intravenously, subcutaneously and intra- muscularly, although the lesions developed in a varying degree of severity. In comparison with those cases where only localised cutaneous lesions deve- loped, there was a greater tendency for fatal termination when generalisation occurred, with the additional production of mouth lesions as was observed with the strain under study. In view of its highly virulent nature it is being main- tained at this Institute. SUMMARY (1) A survey of the past work on fowl-pox and several other allied condi- tions, now known to be etiologically one and the same, has been made. (2) Experimental transmission of diphtheritic lesions from the mouth of fowls has confirmed that the causal agent, a filtrable virus, is the same as that which produces fowl-pox lesions on the skin in India. (3) The Indian strain of fowl-pox virus is immunologically indistinguish- able from the Weybridge strain. (4) There seems to be a tendency for generalisation with this particular strain of the virus (obtained from Cannanore, Madras) although this has not been seen in the case of specimens received from other provinces in India, so far. (5) Filtration experiments have been conducted with this strain of the virus and Berkefeld ' V' filtrate has given positive results unlike Chamberland L. 3 and Berkefeld ' N ' filtrates.

OBSERVATIONS ON DOYLE'S DISEASE OF FOWLS BY R. N. NAIK, G.B.V.C., Veterinary Investigation Officer, Bombay Presidency [Received for publication on 27th August, 1936] Doyle's disease, which is commonly known in India as Ranikhet disease, is a disease of the greatest economic importance as it ranks first amongst the diseases of fowls in causing mortality. It was first recognised in the United Kingdom by Doyle in 1926 and in India by Dr. Edwards in 1927. Since then it has been found prevalent in certain other parts of the world ; Piecard found it in Java in 1928, Rodier in the Philippine in 1929 and Ochi and Hashimoto in Korea in the same year. In the Bombay Presidency the disease was first recog- nised by me in the year 1932 and materials from the artificially infected fowls were forwarded to the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, for confirmation. It is also understood that the disease is very extensively pre- valent in various parts of India. It is a fatal disease and whenever it breaks out in a village it wipes out the major portion of the fowl population if not the whole and as a result poultry-breeding industry is sustaining very heavy losses every year. Unfortunately no curative treatment or prophylaxis against the disease has been found out as yet. All efforts made by different workers in this respect have, so far, proved abortive ; Doyle [1927] tried heat-killed virus without suc- cess ; he, however, experimented with an anti-serum prepared from ducks and found that birds treated with it failed to contract the disease by contact but died when artificially infected. Cooper [1931], on the other hand, succeeded in protecting birds against artificial infection by injecting serum prepared from immune fowls. But as the quantity of serum obtained from a fowl or a duck is extremely small this contribution to the knowledge of immunology has served no practical purposes in dealing with the disease. Doyle [1927] further found, in Great Britain, that formalinised virus when applied by the subcutaneous route afforded considerable protection against natural infection but not against arti- ficial one, whereas all attempts made in India at the Imperial Institute of Veteri- nary Research, Muktesar, to prepare such a product either by treating the vital organs with chloroform or formalin or by desiccating them in vacuo have proved of no avail. In the lay press in India one frequently comes across reports, evidently written by fowl-breeders having little knowledge of the disease, and medicines claiming good results obtained by the oral administration of kerosine oil or some other stuff. But it is needless to say here that they have proved utterly useless in saving the life of affected fowls. (322)
OBSERVATIONS ON DOYLE'S DISEASE OF FOWLS 323 In the Western countries the disease is stamped out soon after its appearance by destroying the affected and in-contacts and by thorough disinfection under legislation. It is possible to do this there easily without great loss as the disease is of rare occurrence. But, in India, the disease has found a permanent home and it is impossible to control it as there is no such legislation. Even if the latter be enacted, still it would not be possible to control it on account of its extensive prevalence all over India and the paucity of the members of the Civil Veterinary Department in the Provinces. The only course left to India, is, therefore, to find out an efficient prophylaxis against the disease. In the past I tried intravenous injections of formalin and Lugol's solutions in a certain number of outbreaks without any success. I have also tried the oral administration of the concentrated solution of potassium permanganate in brandy and 0.3 per cent hydrochloric acid in milk at the recommendation of some American Missionary people in India with the same negative results. During the last Christmas the disease was found prevalent at the Ramabai Mukti Mission compound and I tried intravenous and subcutaneous injections of Trypanblue at the doses of 1 to 4 c.c. of 1 per cent solution as a curative and preventive treatment and found that the drug possessed considerable prophylactic value. Systematic experiments were thereupon undertaken to ascertain the extent of this value under artificial and field conditions. Prophylactic value of Trypanblue under artificial conditions Experiment 1.324 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, IV fed by hand. The temperature of the birds was recorded twice daily. Details of these birds are given in Table I. The following is the abstract of the same :OBSERVATIONS ON DOYLE'S DISEASE OF FOWLS 325 and fourteen fowls were protected with trypanblue solution at the rate of 1 to 3 c.c. according to age. The drug was injected intravenously in some and sub- cutaneously in others. All fowls were allowed to move about as usual and re- main in their own pens. Only one of these birds showed symptoms of the disease on the 7th day after injection, which was thereupon destroyed and burnt. All other birds remained perfectly healthy. Details of these fowls are given in Table II. The results obtained in this experiment show that trypanblue afforded ade- quate protection to fowls subjected to its injection and maintained under field conditions. Experiment 3.326 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, IV period during which death has occurred as a result of contact infection is five days. If all deaths that have occurred within this period and also those which have occurred within a week following dullness from the second day are excluded the mortality figure comes to only one, thus giving a percentage mortality of 0.7. It is a known thing that whenever the disease appears in a fowl house or in a closely inhabited locality as that of the Mission compound, Dhond, all fowls of the house or locality succumb to it save a small percentage up to 5. But the fact that more than 80 per cent of the fowls failed to contract the disease at this institution goes to show that trypanblue had exerted a protective action against it.

The phenomenon of the protection afforded by trypanblue is believed to be due to the saturation of the body cells with the drug, thus producing an unfavourable condition for the minimal doses of the virus ordinarily picked up under field conditions to multiply in the body. CONCLUSION Under the existing knowledge of the disease and from the results reported here, it would appear, that the best plan to control the disease is to destroy the affected and to divide the in-contact fowls into groups of 1 to 5. All healthy and in-contact fowls should be injected with trypanblue at the rate of 1 to 3 c.c. of 1 per cent solution subcutaneously or intravenously, the latter being prefer- able. All fowls should be allowed to run about in the sun or in the open. Potassium permanganate which has the highest virucidal action over the virus of this particular disease according to Doyle [1927] should be mixed in the

Examination of the birds should be carried out daily and those showing symptoms of illness should be destroyed in order to remove the infection forthwith. REFERENCES Ann. Adm. Rep. Imp. Inst. Vet.

ANANT NARAYAN RAO, G.M.V.C., Lecturer in Parasitology, AND S. VAITHYANATHA MUDALIAR, G.M.V.C., Assistant Lecturer, Madras Veterinary College. [Received for publication on 3rd March 1936] Introduction Bovine nasal granuloma, or to be more accurate bovine nasal schistosomiasis, seems to exist only in India so far as is known at present. Recently it has been reported from Ceylon. There are no records available to show how long ago this disease made its appearance in India, but Malkani [1933] says that its pre- valence has been known in parts of Bihar and Orissa for over a century and it is more than likely that it existed in this country from the remote past. The morphology and the intermediary hosts of the parasite, the histopatho- logy and the symptoms of this peculiar schistosomiasis of cattle and buffaloes are now known. Still there are gaps in our knowledge regarding such points as other definitive hosts, if any, the regional distribution of the disease, the conditions governing such distribution, its therapy and control. In this paper the present authors record their observations regarding its therapy. The earliest recorded account of the treatment of this disease is by Jeysing Raj [1908] who adopted surgical methods, for which purpose he invented two scoops. Theagaraj [1919] and Subramaniam [1919] attempted to treat such animals by rubbing a mixture of powdered copper sulphate and alum to the lesions in the nose without success. Parthasarathi [1921] was the first in the field to adopt a successful method of treatment by injecting intravenously solutions of tartar emetic and this he did at a time when nothing was known about the etiology of the disease. This line of treatment was followed by Bhuvarahachari [1922] and others. In the annual reports of the Madras Civil Veterinary Department, mention has been made from 1925-26 onwards of the number of animals successfully treated with tartar emetic. It would appear from records available on the subject that most of the work on the treatment of this disease with tartar emetic was done in the Madras Presidency, but the absence of information regarding deaths during the course of treatment is conspicuous. In the annual report of the Civil (332)
TREATMENT OF BOVINE NASAL SCHISTOSOMIASIS 333 Veterinary Department, Madras, 1931-32, mention has been made of one case successfully treated with Antimosan. Roy Chowdhuri [1932] has also recorded his experience in the treatment of nasal schistosomiasis with this drug. Perusal of the records on the treatment of this disease reveals several gaps, notably with respect to : (1) the minimum dose of tartar emetic to effect a cure, (2) the percentage strength of the solution of the drug for intravenous injections, (3) the length of the course of treatment, (4) relapses, if any, after treatment and (5) the mortality during treatment and its causes. Experimental work on the treatment of Nasal Schistosomiasis Some experiments were conducted in the Madras Veterinary College Labora- tory during the year 1935-36 commencing in March 1935, and the scheme of work was so arranged as to ascertain :334 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, IV of 3.75 grains of the drug (or 1.5 grains per 100 lbs. body-weight) on six consecutive days. The total quantity of the drug for the whole course of treatment was 22.5 grains. Daily examination of the nasal discharge showed that dark and dead ova began to appear from the fifth day after the commencement of the treatment, and the ova disappeared from the 12th day. In six weeks the snoring and the lesions disappeared. The animal improved in condition progressively and weighed 365 lbs. before it was destroyed on 13th August 1935. A careful post-mortem examination was held and no schistosomes could be detected in its nasal veins and the histological examination of its nasal mucous membrane showed that the lesions had healed. Bullock No. 2.TREATMENT OF BOVINE NASAL SCHISTOSOMIASIS 335 105.8° F. and it was dull and unable to feed or move. It died nearly 36 hours later. Post-mortem examination revealed a fairly large number of dead schistosomes in the veins of the nasal mucous membrane, in the clot of blood in the heart cavities and in the pul- monary arteries. The endocardium was inflamed in places and there was effusion in the pericardial sac. The mucous membrane of the abomasm and the small intestines was slightly congested in small patches in about 3 or 4 places. Group B.336 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, IV along with other symptoms, by the end of four weeks. Ova began to re-appear 18 weeks after the first injection. The animal was again treated with the same dose of antimosan which caused them to disappear in about ten days. The animal appeared clinically cured. On 12th August 1935, this animal was selected to try the effect of progressively larger doses of tartar emetic. It was first given 3.75 grains of that drug per 100 lbs. body-weight in one dose. Three days later, it was given 5.6 gains per 100 lbs. body-weight and within 12 hours the animal died. This animal showed a rise in temperature to 103°F. within 24 hours after the first injection, was dull and off-feed during that period. On post-mortem examination, no schistosomes were found, but endo-carditis and congestion of the intestinal mucous membrane were noticed. It would appear, therefore, that a dose of 3.75 grains per 100 lbs. body-weight of the drug may produce a reaction in cattle and is unsafe to repeat it during the period of reaction. Heifer No. 11.TREATMENT OF BOVINE NASAL SCHISTOSOMIASIS 337 the course of treatment and became weak and emaciated. On the 26th April it was injected with 5 grains of tartar emetic. It reacted severely after this injection. The animal was dull, off-feed, and unsteady in gait though the temperature was normal. This condition lasted for five days. A week later, it was again injected with the same dose of tartar emetic. Even this dose caused a reaction lasting for four days. Within three weeks after the last injection the ulcers in the nose and ova in the nasal discharge disappeared and the animal was found cured at the close of the experiments. Its weight was then found to be 325 lbs. Bullock No. 9.338 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, IV Discussion on the dosage of antimony tartarate and its dilution Only very meagre information is available in text-books on Veterinary Pharmacology and Toxicology regarding the therapeutic dose of this drug and its dilution for intravenous use in cattle. Some amount of information is avail- able, however, in papers on the treatment of flystruck cattle in Africa contributed by Hornby [1919, 1921]. He seems to have used 1.6 to 2 grains per 100 lbs. body- weight. Edwards [ 1929 ] commenting on the work of Das, says that at Muktesar, cattle tolerate doses of 5 c.c. of a 3 per cent solution (or 2.25 grains per 100 lbs. body-weight), that this dose can be repeated daily for about 10 days and that it is not safe to increase this dosage, though cattle may tolerate double that dose for three days. Even with 2.25 grains per 100 lbs. body-weight, Edwards says that accidents may follow. From our experiments, it is gathered that a dose which causes a reaction is a sub-lethal dose. Hence, the therapeutic dose should be much less than the sub-lethal dose and considerably so. if it is to be repeated at short intervals for the reason that the drug is more or less cumulative. Our experiments show that a dose of 1.5 grains per 100 lbs. body-weight, given daily for six days, is not harmful in any way and at the same time, the desired results are obtained. From the published records of previous workers, it is not possible to calculate the doses they gave per unit of body-weight since none of them excepting Das, seems to have noted the weights of the animals treated. Doraiswami [ 1934 ] and Iyengar [ 1934 ] appear to be the only two, who computed the dose of the drug according to the body-weight of the animals they treated. The former gave 3 or 4 grains while the latter only 1.25 grains per 100 lbs. body-weight. Iyengar goes further in saying that the dose can be reduced to one grain per unit of body-weight without losing the efficacy of the treatment. Edwards [ 1928 ] found that the minimum lethal dose of tartar emetic to hill cattle is 14 c.c. of M-10 solu- tion or just over 5.5 grains per 100 lbs. body-weight. Our experiments confirm this. As regards the dilution of the drug for intravenous use in cattle, there have been differences of opinion among the previous workers. It would appear, that they used solutions ranging from 2 to 15 per cent in strength, presumably without any ill-effects. Krishnamurthi [ 1922] said that a powerful drug like antimony tartarate should be given in the form of a 2 per cent solution and administered 20 grains of the drug in that dilution, but the animal collapsed and died 12 hours later. Das [ 1929 ] injected 15.5 grains in 50 c.c. of water (nearly 2 per cent solu- tion) in an animal weighing 440 lbs. (or 3.5 grains per 100 lbs. body-weight) and it died soon after. Pillai [1934] recommended a different plan of action. He chose to give 10 to 20 grains of the drug, presumably in 20 c.c. of saline or water (3 - 3 to 6.6 per cent solution) and injected it into the jugular vein, very slowly, taking over five minutes to complete the operation, so as to allow further dilution of the solution in the blood before it reached the heart. With this procedure, he says, he met with no accidents of any sort. It is doubtful, if such a length of time for
TREATMENT OF BOVINE NASAL SCHISTOSOMIASIS 339 the operation is at all necessary. Much care, no doubt, is necessary to prevent the solution escaping into the perivascular tissue, the chances of which are ob- viously greater if five minutes are taken, instead of as many seconds, to complete the operation. In actual practice, it is not possible for one to take such a long time for each injection when many animals have to be done in a day. Hornby [ 1921 ] used a 4 per cent solution for intravenous injections and appears to have finished the operation rapidly with no ill-effects. Other workers such as Richardson [ 1928 ] and Holmes [ 1921 ] have also used a 4 per cent solution or even a little over, without any bad results, but the dose they all gave appears to be not more than 2 5 grains per 100 lbs. body-weight. In the experiments done here, a 6 per cent solution was injected fairly rapidly into the vein in the animals treated and no ill-effects followed. It has already been pointed out, that even 15 per cent solutions have been injected by the previous workers without any ill-effects. It, therefore, seems clear that it is not the dilution of the drug that causes accidents so much, as the dose and its repetition. A dilute solution may perhaps cause a less intensive tissue reaction than a more concentrated one, if by chance, it escapes into the perivascular tissue. Elimination of tartar emetic from the system Therapeutists admit that tartar emetic is a cumulative drug, though less so than arsenic. Clark [ 1932 ] says that antimony unlike arsenic is rapidly ex- creted and there is less tendency for cumulative poisoning to occur, when the drug is given intravenously. He further says that 30 per cent of the drug is excreted through the urine and it is not known how much is excreted in faeces when it is given intravenously. Faust and Maleney [ 1924 ] say that a large proportion of the drug is excreted by way of the intestines. Edwards [ 1928 ] says that the drug is not discernible in the blood stream three days after intra- venous administration. Krishna Iyer and Sarwar [ 1935 ] say that in two days time, it is excreted completely. Hence, it is clear that a therapeutic dose given intravenously is excreted rapidly and theoretically speaking, it should be possible to repeat this dose in three days. But practical experience has shown that death may be caused, if the same dose is repeated after a reaction has been obtained to the first dose. Such a thing did happen in Bullock No. 3, even when the interval between the two doses was a week and also in Bull No. 7. The symptoms of reaction observed in the experimental animals were (1) a rise in temperature, (2) disinclination to move, (3) weakness of pulse, (4) loss of appetite, (5) dryness of the mucous membrane of the mouth and nose, and (6) unsteadiness of gait. These symptoms persisted for about four days. If these symptoms are encountered in an animal after injection of the drug, it indicates that the limits of a therapeutic dose have been transgressed and those of a sub-lethal dose have been reached. In such cases, if the dose is repeated before or soon after the signs of reaction have subsided, accidents are likely to occur : at any rate, it is an indication, that sub- sequent doses should be smaller in order to avoid untoward results,
340 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, IV It is interesting to note that Parthasarathi [ 1921 ] considered that the proper dose of the drug should be such as to cause a reaction in the animal and the symp- toms he describes are almost the same as those met with here. In the absence of reaction to a certain dose, he advocated the repetition of an increased dose, the very next day until a reaction was set up. He said that this reacting dose, which in his opinion was the dose of maximum therapeutic efficiency could be repeated at intervals of two to seven days according to the degree of severity of the disease. It is evident from this that Parthasarathi treated his cases with sub-lethal doses of tartar emetic. It is unfortunate that neither he, nor other workers who adopted his method of treatment reported cases of mortality, if any, during treatment, perhaps the deaths that occurred were not brought to their notice or ascribed to some other cause. It seems likely that some deaths would have occurred as a result of pushing sub-lethal doses without allowing sufficient time for excretion of the drug from the system. Krishnamurthi [ 1922 ], Mahadevan [ 1923 ] and Das [ 1929 ] are the only workers who have recorded deaths in animals treated with tartar emetic. Obviously, therefore, reacting doses and their repetition at short intervals are not safe in the treatment of cattle suffering from this complaint. The action of the drug on schistosomes and their ova Faust and Meleney [ 1924 ] ascertained how quickly schistosomes are killed in vitro in various concentrations of sodium-antimony-tartarate. They found, that in a dilution of 1 to 42,000 the worms died in one hour. They, therefore, opined that if this concentration is exceeded in the body, for even a short space of time after the administration of the drug, and if such a dose is repeated daily or on alternate days, the worms would soon be killed. Their work gives us a clue on which to base the lowest daily dose of tartar emetic sufficient to kill the worms without causing harm to the animal treated. In our experiments, the lowest dose administered was 1.5 grains per 100 lbs. body-weight, which represents a dilution of 1 to 32,000 in the blood of an animal at the time of injection. This concentration is more than the limit laid down by Faust and Meleney. The repetition of this dose daily, for a reasonable length of time, should, therefore, kill the worms. It was found in experimental animal No. 1 that six such daily injections cured the animal and this was verified at autopsy nearly four and a half months after treatment. The drug has action on the ova of schistosomes in the tissue, which is borne out by the fact, that in about four or five days after the commencement of treatment, dark and dead ova appeared. Hence it would seem that successful treatment of a case of schistosomiasis does not so much depend on the total amount of the drug administered as on the maintenance of a certain amount of concentration of the drug in the blood at a constant level by repeated injections of suitable doses,
TREATMENT OF BOVINE NASAL SCHISTOSOMIASIS 341 Obviously, therefore, it is of little use either to give a reacting dose or to increase the dose progressively at long intervals, as suggested by many of the previous workers in the treatment of this disease. Length of the course of treatment.342 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, IV to each animal while conducting mass treatment against bovine nasal schisto- somiasis in Chittoor district, and that he found many of the animals reacting to this dose possibly because a large majority of cattle are small in size in that dis- trict. Some of the ryots worked their animals in the plough soon after injections of tartar emetic, and to their dismay some of them dropped down dead while working. In such animals evidently there was a reaction set up and they died of its effects aggravated by work. The ryots, in most villages, being poor, do not possess more than one pair of bullocks; necessarily they cannot afford to rest their animals since they have none others to do the work. If, therefore, such disasters were to be anticipated, the ryots even with persuasion, for obvious reasons, will not subject their animals to treatment. Therefore, one has to employ such doses as would not cause reaction ; in other words, the doses employed must be small so as to be given repeatedly with impunity, even if the animals are worked immediately during treatment. It is seen from the experiments done here that a daily dose of 1.5 grains per 100 lbs. body-weight for six days is not only effective but also reduces the length of the course of treatment when compared with any other method. Further, there is no possibility of producing a reaction with such a small dose, thus avoiding the danger of the animal collapsing and dying. Discussion on the treatment with Antimosan Antimosan is a synthetic antimony preparation recommended by the makers for use in the treatment of schistosomiasis in cattle. The drug is available in the form of 6.3 per cent solution and the dose recommended is 40 c.c. for an animal weighing 450 lbs. or 8.8 c.c. per 100 lbs. body-weight. This dose, they say, should be repeated every second or third day. 100 c.c. of this drug contains only 12.5 grains of antimony : hence in the dose recommended there are only 5 grains of it or roughly 1.2 grains per 100 lbs. body-weight. It is interesting, therefore, to note that this dose of antimony is nearly equal to that of antimony tartarate which the present writers found to be safe and efficacious, for daily injections, for six days. The makers of antimosan quote Roy Chowdhury [ 1932 ] regarding the use- fulness of the drug in the treatment of bovine nasal schistosomiasis. That worker was supplied with the powder form of the drug. It would appear that he did not compute the dose of the drug per unit of body-weight, but gave varying doses, which, in some cases were increased progressively with an interval of a week between two doses. Hence, it is not possible to compare his results with those obtained by the present writers. It will be seen that the doses he gave were smaller and spaced at longer intervals than those recommended by the makers of the drug. The present writers found that in an animal treated with small doses of Antimosan, the symptoms abated in about 4 weeks. The animal looked clini- cally cured, but this was not the case, as ova continued to appear. Hence, the
TREATMENT OF BOVINE NASAL SCHISTOSOMIASIS 343 results of Roy Chowdhury [ 1932 ] cannot be said to be conclusive in as much as the animals he treated with Antimosan were not under his observation for a sufficiently long time, nor was it possible for him then, to appreciate the results of treatment by laboratory methods as can now be done, since the etiology of the disease is known. Roy Chowdhury opines that recently infected animals require only one dose for a cure. It is doubtful, if, in the treatment of this disease, the administration of a single large dose of any drug will effect a cure and the reasons are obvious. Another interesting observation is that recovery was definite in those animals which received, at short intervals, doses almost equal to those recommended by the makers of the drug. It would appear, therefore, that the proper dose of the drug is the one that has been recommended by the makers repeated at intervals of 2 or 3 days until about 4 injections are given. Discussion on the Treatment of Trypaflavin Trypaflavin is the same as Acriflavin. This drug was tried, because Fisher [ 1934 ] reported, that he obtained with Acriflavin, some amount of success in the treatment of intestinal schistosomiasis in the human being. He gave the drug orally and no toxic manifestations seem to have been developed. Trypaflavin was found to be useless in the treatment of bovine nasal schisto- somiasis and on the other hand, it was noticed that the drug when given intra- venously for some time, has harmful effects on the liver. Cost of treatment with tartar emetic and Antimosan The cost of a pound of tartar emetic is about Rs. 1-8-0 and the cost of the full course of 6 injections for an animal weighing 450 lbs. at 1.5 grains per 100 lbs. body-weight is 1.5 pies. This drug, therefore, is so cheap that nearly 200 animals of average weight may be treated at a cost of Rs. 1-8-0, when compared with that of Antimosan which is about Rs. 2-8-0 for one animal for a course of treatment recommended by the makers. SUMMARY 1. Antimonium tartaratum, Antimosan and Trypaflavin were given a trial in treating cases of bovine nasal schistosomiasis. 2. Trypaflavin was found to be useless. Antimosan appears to be safe and effective if given according to the instructions of the makers, but expensive. 3. Antimonium tartaratum is effective and cheap. The dose recommended is 1.5 grains for every 100 lbs. body-weight of the animal repeated daily for six days, or 2.5 grains every alternate day. 4. Any dose exceeding 3.5 grains per 100 lbs. body-weight seems to be dangerous particularly, if repeated.

ON THE IDENTITY OF THE NEMATODE WORM RECOVERED FROM HUMP SORE OF CATTLE IN INDIA BY P. G. PANDE, M.Sc., M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Investigation Officer, Assam. [Received for publication on 30th June 1936.] (With Plates XXII & XXIII) INTRODUCTION In a preliminary report [1935] by the writer on the etiology of this disease it was stated that the adult nematodes recovered from the lesions bore certain resemblance to the members of the sub-family SETARINAE of the family FILARIDAE. The exact identity of the worm at that time was attended with some difficulty, since by the appearance of the worm and the nature of the lesion it sets up, it appeared to be a new parasite for which no reference could be found in older text-books on helminthology. During the earlier investigation of this disease when its etiology was known in 1933, the writer was informed by the Director, Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, that the nema- tode larvae had also been seen in an identical affection of cattle called " Cascado " in the Dutch East Indies. No fuller reference on " Cascado " could be available until Datta in January, 1935, at the Indian Science Congress at Calcutta stated that his studies on the histopathology of hump sore had led him to conclude that this disease of Indian cattle was similar to " Cascado " of cattle in the Dutch East Indies, caused by STEPHANOFILARIA DEDOESI (Bubberman, C. and Krane- veld, F. C). Few specimens were therefore received through the courtesy of Dr. F. L. Huber, Director, State Veterinary Institute, Buitenzorg, Java. On the result of a comparative study of the parasites of hump sore and " Cascado " the writer was able to ascertain that the parasite of hump sore belonged to the genus STEPHANOFILARIA, but that in certain morphological details it differed from STEPHANOFILARIA DEDOESI. In June, 1934, Chitwood described STEPHANO- FILARIA STILESI, a new species from the skin of cattle in the United States. On the basis of Chitwood's description of STEPHANIFILARIA STSLESI, many points of difference have been noticed between this worm and that recovered from hump sore. In view of these observations it was decided to create a new species STEPHA- NOFILARIA ASSAMENSIS for the parasite of the Indian disease, by virtue of its being discovered for the first time in Assam. In the following pages it is pro- posed to give an account of the new species, and then comparing it with two other known species, to indicate certain anatomical differences which led to its specific diagnosis.

The anterior portion of the IDENTITY OF THE NEMATODE WORM 347 TECHNIQUE The collection of worms from the lesion of hump sore presents certain diffi- culties. The most convenient site for their recovery is the demarcation line between the central core and the periphery of a quiescent lesion. A place over this line is selected and the sore tissue scraped off with a slightly blunt scalpel. On thus scraping away the whole cornified layer of the superficial epithelium and a part of the rete malpighi, a thread like projection of what appears to be one of the ends of the female worm is seen on the surface. This is then picked up with a pair of finely pointed forceps and placed in a petri dish containing normal saline. The scraped up material should be placed in another petri dish con- taining normal saline, because not infrequently an entire female worm could be found embedded in a lump of scraped up tissue. The male worms are very minute, and for the purpose of their collection the scraped up tissue is thoroughly teased with a fine pair of needles, and a search is made for the parasite under one-third objective of the microscope. For the purpose of an immediate examination the embryonated ova could be collected by teasing a gravid female on a slide in a drop of normal saline. Plenty of ova are thus liberated either individually or in lumps which represent parts of the uteri. The saline film on the slide is then allowed to dry up so as to fix up the ova. The preparation is then stained with Leishman or Giemsa stain. Certain anatomical features such as the cuticular spines, the vulva and the vagina could be seen best in a living specimen. Beechwood creosote has been used as a clearing agent to see various other details, such as the nerve ganglia, tubular oesophagus, and the spicules in the male. A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PARASITE Freshly recovered parasites from the sore have frequently been found covered with fragments of sore tissue towards their anterior extremity. The female parasites have always been found predominating over the male ones in number, and in collections made from several cases the numerical ratio between the male and the female has been 1 : 3. When placed in normal saline, the worms exhibit sluggish movements. They are small, whitish and thread like worms, the females being two to three times larger than the males. The anterior extremity of the male and the female which carries the mouth is slightly attenuated. The mouth opening (Plate XXIII, Fig. 4) is minute, circular and bordered with a notched chitenous ring. Immediately behind the mouth is a prominent conical structure (Plate XXII, Fig. 1, and Plate XXIII, Fig. 4) from which the mouth appears to be protruding anteriorly. At the base of the oral protrusion the thick conical structure is encircled with a single complete ring of cuticular spines (Plate XXIII, Fig. 4) which in some specimens also shows group arrangement at places. The cuticle is smooth over the conical structure, and commencing with a deep notch

For a greater length of the anterior part of the body, the posterior edges of the striae are directed posteriorly in the form of spines, but towards the posterior extremity the striae become inconspicuous and their posterior edges smooth. Lateral alae are present. The terminal mouth leads into a tubular oesophagus (Plate XXII, Fig. 1) which measures about from 124 to 180 microns from the mouth opening in both the sexes. The nerve ring (Plate XXII, Fig. 1) in both the sexes is situated at a distance of 72 microns from the mouth opening. Cloacal opening is distinct in the male, (Plate XXII, Fig. 2) but it appears to be absent in the female. The male worm.Ind. Jour. Vety. Sci. & Anim. Husb., Vol. VI, Pt. IV.

In a gravid female worm the uteri and the vagina contain fully developed embryos (Plate XXII, Fig. 1) each enclosed in a flexible vitelline membrane. The embryonated eggs (Plate XXIII, Figs. 6 (a) and 6 (b)) measure from 39.6 × 28.8 to 43.2 × 36.0 with the membrane. The microfilariae as seen outside the membrane in a stained smear measure from 126 to 144 microns. DISCUSSION Ihle and Ihle-Landenberg [1933] were the first to describe the filarial worm recovered from " Cascado " of cattle in the Dutch East Indies, for which they created a new generic name STEPHANOFILARIA, and named the parasite as STEPHA- NOFILARIA DEDOESI. Wehr [1935] in his revised classification of the superfamily FILARIOIDEA has included a new family STEPHANOFILARIIDAE for the reception of the genus STEPHANOFILARIA, Ihle and Ihle-Landenberg [1933]. Another species of this genus has been described by Chitwood, [1934] as STEPHANOFILARIA STILESI. Chitwood distinguishes his species from the original species by the following two characters :350 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, IV arrangement. In the opinion of the writer, therefore, the arrangement of the cephalic spines appears to have no value in the classification of the species of STEPHANOFILARIA. The other character, i.e., the position of the vulvar orifice from the mouth opening by which Chitwood distinguishes his species from STEPHA- NOFILARIA DEDOESI appears to be an important feature in the taxonomy of the worm. Before any opinion is given as regards the identity of the worm at the disposal of the writer, it will be of interest to compare the salient features of the two known species with those of the species under consideration.

While there is not much difference in the length of the male of the three species, they show marked variation in the measurement of their thickness. The position of the cloaca in STEPHANOFILARIA DEDOESI and STEPHANOFILARIA ASSAMENSIS in which this feature has been observed shows no variation at all, but the left spicule of STEPHANOFILARIA ASSAMENSIS is much smaller than the same structure of the other two known species. While the female of the Indian species is only slightly greater in length than the female of STEPHANOFILARIA DEDOESI, it is much greater in length when com- pared with the female of STEPHANOFILARIA STILESI. The position of the vulvar

The Indian species can, therefore, be distinguished from the other two known species by the following features :DETOXICATED URINE TREATMENT FOR IMPOTENCY IN STUD BULLS AND STERILITY IN COWS BY WYNNE SAYER, B.A., DIP. AGRI. (CANTAB.), Imperial Agriculturist AND L. S. JOSEPH, G.B.V.C., Cattle Superintendent, Imperial Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi. [Received for publication on the 16th September, 1936] (With Plates XXIV & XXV) When the senior author investigated in 1931 the causes of the gradually increasing number of cases of impotency in bulls and sterility in cows in the Pusa Sahiwal herd, he found that most of them were due to the faulty feeding policy pursued in the past. The rationing was, therefore, entirely changed [Sayer, 1934] and its excellent effect on both bulls and cows was soon apparent. The few cases of impotency in bulls and sterility in cows that were not, how- ever, amenable to the changed rationing were put under the hormone treatment [Phillip, 1929]. A number of cases of impotency and sterility were given the above treat- ment quite successfully, out of which two cases are quoted below for illustra- tion. The method followed here is given below : DETOXICATION OF URINE FOR INJECTION Collect in a sterile enamel mug about 100 c.c. of urine from a cow over seven months in calf. Early morning urine is preferable. Detoxicate at once. To each 100 c.c. of urine add 5 c.c. of a 20 per cent solution of sulpho-salicylic acid. Shake well for ten minutes to precipitate all proteins. Allow to stand and pass through a coarse filter paper. Neutralise or render faintly alkaline to litmus by the addition of bicarbonate of soda. Dosage.Ind. Jour. Vety. Sci. & Anim. Husb., Vol. VI, Pt.

URINE TREATMENT FOR IMPOTENCY IN STUD BULLS AND STERILITY IN COWS 353 SAHIWAL BULL ' MAHARAJ ' NO. 300 (PLATE XXIV) This bull was born on the 27th January, 1920, of Raseeli No. 132, one of our foundation cows, by Sahiwal bull Mansoor. His dam was a typical Sahiwal cow with a natural disease-resistant constitution, who gave fourteen calves and 30,000 lb. of milk during her life time on the Farm. She lived twenty-two years without any serious ailment and was a regular calver. It was decided to keep this bull for stud purposes. When Maharaj was three years old, he was tried with a number of cows for service and failed utterly ; consequently he was sent uncastrated to the Agri- cultural Section for draught purposes. In 1932, he was brought back from the Farm and given the " detoxicated urine treatment" and since then he is serving satisfactorily and so far he has sired twenty-two calves, out of which eleven are heifer calves. His disease- resistant faculty was tested this year during the outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease. He was artificially infected with the infective saliva thrice, but he proved absolutely immune and similar tests with his progeny also showed them naturally resistant to the disease to a great extent. His first heifer which was born on the 23rd December 1933, received bull when she was one year, six months and thirteen days old. She has since calved, developed a very good shape bag, and has given 2,122 lb. of milk in 107 days and is giving about 16 lb. daily. The average birth weight of his calves is 43.3 lb. and this shows that the progeny he is producing is quite normal and there is not the least trace of lack of stamina or reduction in size and conformation. SAHIWAL COW ' LACHMOHNI ' NO. 644 (PLATE XXV) She calved for the first time on the 7th July, 1934, and did not come in oestrus (heat) after the usual period of 150 daysSELECTED ARTICLE STUDIES ON BOVINE MASTITIS XI.STUDIES ON BOVINE MASTITIS 355 Plastridge, Anderson, White and Rettger [1934], working in five herds contain- ing from 25 to 50 cows each, concluded that heat-killed vaccines did not adequately control streptococcus mastitis, while, on the other hand, hygienic measures and segre- gation of infected cows were found to be effective. From one herd the disease was said to have been eradicated and full details are promised later. In 1933 we referred to attempts by other workers to control mastitis by segrega- tion. Thus, Seelemann [1932] described the promising results obtained in two herds in which, purely by segregation of infected cows, infection was reduced respectively from 40 to about 10 per cent in fifteen months, and from 70 to 20 per cent in two years. In the latter herd it was reported [1933] that by combining entozon treatment with segregation the infection had been reduced to 4.2 per cent.

Notes.STUDIES ON BOVINE MASTITIS 357 " Healthy " and " Infected " refer to cows free from or infected with Str. agalactiæ. " Healthy became Infected " refers to animals which became infected during the year stated, but which were in the healthy section on December 31st of the previous year ; the percentage is calculated on the number in the healthy section at that date. " Healthy Added " and " Infected Added " refer to animals which were added to the herd during the year in question and which were free from or infected with Str. agalactiæ, respectively at their first test. "Healthy Removed" and "Infected Removed " refer to healthy or infected animals (whether infected at first test or subsequently) which died or were sold during the year in question. The figures in brackets express percentages. Of the 29 cows classed as infected in 1935, 9 had been free from infection for at least two years. The number of cows actually infected at the end of 1935 is, therefore, 20, and the real incidence 13.1 per cent. (See comment.) Since 1929 milk samples have been examined at three-monthly intervals from all animals in milk, including those in the infected section. Additional samples have been taken seven to ten days after calving, and from any animal which showed ab- normality of the udder or milk. It is seen from the table relating to Herd A that the number of cows at December, 1929, was 55 and that 290 ("Healthy added" plus " Infected added ") have been added since. Of these 345 cows, 138 were under obser- vation for one lactation or less, 76 for two, 66 for three, 32 for four, 24 for five and 9 for six lactations. The number of tests made on the milk of each cow was from 2 to 22, a total of 2,482 tests, or an average of a little over 7 for each cow. Comment This herd is notable in the first place because, although the original incidence of Str. agalactiæ was below 10 per cent, milk samples were regularly examined and infected cows milked last or partially segregated, the number of new infections with Str. agalactiæ showed a marked increase in 1932, nearly half of the cows in the herd showing infection in that year. The number of new infections has since gradually decreased, 16.7 per cent being found in 1933, 14.3 per cent in 1934, and 5.3 per cent in 1935. At the time of this report the total number of new infections which have appeared among the 337 cows passed into the healthy sec- tion of the herd is 88. More than half of the infected cows were retained for a long time, chiefly on account of the high incidence of other forms of mastitis in this herd, with the result that at December, 1934, the section of the herd described as infected still formed 28.9 per cent of the whole, whilst at November, 1935, it formed 19.9 per cent. A striking feature of these new infections with Str. agalactiæ, however, is that in 29 cases the organisms have apparently disappeared from the udder. In nearly all of these cases the streptococci were detected once only and usually only by means of the glucose broth enrichment medium, in spite of nume- rous examinations during the following one to three years. Such cows have, however, always been kept in the infected section and the number shown as in- fected is, therefore, unduly high for all years since 1932. The number of cows
358 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, IV actually infected at December 31st, 1934, was 19 per cent, whilst at November, 1935, it was 13.1 per cent. In those infections which became permanent the degree of disturbance was slight at first, but during the last twelve months many of the cows concerned have shown symptoms characteristic of the chronic forms of the disease. Herd A is also notable for the relatively large number of severe cases of mas- titis due to other causes, and especially to streptococci belonging to Group II, which have occurred. In this herd, contrary to the almost general rule, such infections have been the cause of much greater loss than mastitis of the common chronic type. HERD C Her d C is made up of pedigree Jerseys and Red Polls, and from 1929, when observations commenced, it has carried over 100 head of milking stock. The herd has always been practically self-contained, though a few animals have been purchased from time to time. The herd is free from tuberculosis, certified milk being produced, and has been freed from contagious abortion by blood tests and segregation, coincidentally with the work reported here. Milking is carried out by hand.

In addition, the owner has always insisted that milkers should wash their hands after milking each cow and all rea- sonable precautions were taken to prevent spread from infected to healthy animals. Complete herd tests of all animals in milk were carried out every three months in the case of the healthy group and at six- to twelve-monthly intervals in the infected group. Samples were also examined seven to ten days after calving, and from any animal whose milk or udder became abnormal during the interval between herd tests. The total number of animals in the healthy section of the herd in December, 1929, or which have since entered this section (" Healthy added ") is 256. Of these 256 cows, 72 were under observation for one lactation or less, 74 for two lactations, 47 for three, 32 for four, 24 for five and 7 for six lacta- tions. The number of tests made of each cow was from 2 to 17 and in one case 24, a total of 1,621 or an average for each animal of between 6 and 7. The table shows the number of healthy and infected animals in the herd at the end of each year and the movements during the preceding twelve months. The clinical severity of the disease originally present may be gathered from the following statements. By the end of 1929 all the original milking herd had been tested, except four cows which were still dry. Of the 34 infected cows present at that time, 17 were showing clinical symptoms or obviously altered milk in one or more quarters ; 8 showed abnormality of the milk only recognisable by laboratory examination, whilst in 9 the milk was unchanged. The average number of infected quarters per animal was 2.4. Comment In this herd no special attempt was made to dispose of infected cows, but they were immediately segregated, and what were expected to be ample precau- tions were taken to prevent spread of infection. Although there has always been a large group of infected cows on the farm in sheds adjoining those kept for healthy cows, it is somewhat surprising that new infections have continued to appear. Thus, of the 256 animals which were passed as healthy when first tested in the period 1929-35, 79 had become infected up to the end of 1935. Although dropping to less than 6 per cent in 1931 the annual percentage of new infections rose suddenly to over 50 in 1932. It dropped again to 17 per cent in 1933 and 1934, whilst in 1935, 9 per cent have occurred. The result is that the section described as infected, which was originally 39 per cent of the herd, still forms 26 per cent of it. As in Herd A a number of animals apparently recovered. These were, in nearly all cases, animals in which the infection was discovered only by means of the glucose broth enrichment medium and on only one occasion, in spite of numerous examinations during the succeeding years. Since such cows have always been classed as infected the number of animals shown as infected is, in this herd also, unduly high for all years since 1932. The real incidence at the end of 1935 was 17.9 per cent.
360 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, IV As in other herds, a certain amount of trouble due to mastitis streptococci of Groups II and III and to C. pyogenes has occurred, 18 cows in all being affected. HERD I At the end of 1930, when the first examinations were completed, Herd I con- sisted of about 160 head of pedigree milking stock of the British Friesian and Shorthorn breeds. It has been maintained since that time solely by means of home-bred animals. The herd is tuberculin-tested and it has been freed from contagious abortion coincidently with the work reported here. Milking is carried out by machine three times a day and all cows are stripped by hand. After the first herd test infected animals were segregated as far as possible, and milked last. In 1931 the cows were arranged on three standings of which one contained only healthy cows, one healthy and infected at opposite ends, and one infected cows only, one man doing all the work on each line. Three milking machine units were in use in each row, separate units being reserved for the infected cows in the composite line. Teat cups were sterilised at the beginning of milking but not subsequently unless they were dropped. Towards the end of 1931 the owner decided to reduce his herd considerably and amongst those sold were most of the infected cows. From March, 1932, the few remaining infected cows were moved to other buildings. HERD I State of Herd at end of Year Additions, Removals and Cows which became infected duering the previous 12 Months Year Total Healthy Infected Healthy became Infected Healthy Added Healthy Removed Infected Added Infected Removed 1930 158 71 87(55.1) STUDIES ON BOVINE MASTITIS 361 The table, giving the changes in the herd year by year and its composition at December 31st of each year, shows that at the end of the third year the herd was free from Str. agalactiæ and has remained so since that time. The mastitis originally present was of the characteristic chronic variety caused by Str. agalactiæ. The following data regarding the changes observed on one or more occasions will give some idea of its severity. Of the 96 cows of the original herd which were infected at their first examination in 1930 to 1932, 30 showed at or about the time of test clinical symptoms and obviously abnormal milk, 54 showed definite laboratory evidence of mastitis, whilst in 12 the milk was un- altered. The average number of infected quarters per cow was 2.6. Comment In Herd I the contagious form of streptococcus mastitis was radicated within a reasonable period in spite of the high original incidence (55 per cent) and the fact that for the first 18 months infected cows were housed in the same shed as the healthy. It is to be noted, however, that during the first 18 months many animals in the healthy group showed new infections, viz., 22 per cent in 1931 and 12 per cent in 1932, a circumstance which there is reason to believe may have been due in some measure to slackness on the farm. There is no doubt, of course, that the eradication of the disease from this herd was facilitated very considerably by the decision of the owner in the autumn of 1931 to reduce his stock. Most of the in- fected cows were sold then or during the first half of 1932, and other infected cows were from that time completely separated. Apart from mastitis due to C. pyogenes, which has caused the loss of a small number of quarters, the herd has been strikingly free from obvious udder distur- bance due to streptococci other than Str. agalactiæ and during the last three years there has been practically no mastitis of any kind. HERD J This herd belonged to the same owner as Herds K and L, to be described next. Infected animals from Herds J and K were sent to other premises for isola- tion. There has been some interchange between the animals of Herds J and K, although different attendants were used on the two farms. Early in 1933 it was decided to raise a new herd on another farm, starting with freshly calved heifers. This is designated Herd L. Herd J consists of about 45 animals of the Ayrshire breed and is maintained entirely by home-bred stock. It is free from tuberculosis ; the eradication of con- tagious abortion was begun in 1932, and at recent tests there were no reactors. Milking is carried out by machine and all cows are stripped by hand. The first tests for mastitis were carried out in November, 1931 and by the end of 1932, 55 animals of the original herd had been tested for the first time. Of these 55 animals, 16 (29.1 per cent) were infected,
362 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, IV All animals in milk were examined at intervals of three months during 1932 and subsequently at six-monthly intervals. All found to be infected at the first or later tests were removed as soon as convenient to the owner. Post-calving samples were not examined and animals found to be infected at any given test had, therefore, already been in the herd for some time. As mentioned, up to the end of 1932, 16 animals were recognised as infected at their first tests; in 1933 one such animal was located. The total number of animals classed as healthy at their first test in 1931 or subsequently was 92. Of these 92, 16 were under observation for one lactation or less, 32 for two, 20 for three and 24 for four lacta- tions. The number of examinations made of each cow was from 2 to 11, a total of 464 or an average of about 5 for each animal. The table shows the number of animals in the herd at the end of each year and the movements during the previous twelve months. The general character of the mastitis originally present, which was almost solely of the common chronic type, can be gathered from the fact that of the 16 cows of the original herd found to be infected, 4 showed at or about the time of test clinical symptoms or marked change in the milk, 9 showed definite laboratory evidence of mastitis, whilst in 3 the milk was unchanged in any way. The average number of infected quarters was 2.

The average number of infected quarters was 2.6. Comment Although since infected cows were removed, it might perhaps have been expected that the disease would by now have been eradicated, the fact that the number of infections has steadily fallen whilst the herd has been increasing is satisfactory. Thus, whereas the original percentage of infection was over 50 per cent, the percentages of new infections in 1932, 1933, 1934 and 1935 were 44, 33, 10 and 7.8 respectively. Failure to eradicate the disease may have been due to the same factors as operated in Herd J. The herd has been entirely free from mastitis due to causes other than Str. agalactiæ, whilst mastitis due to this organism has been confined to latent cases. HERD L This herd was formed early in 1933 from freshly calved Ayrshire heifers belonging to the owner of Herds J and K. It is free from tuberculosis and con- tagious abortion. The animals are hand-milked. Tests were carried out at intervals of six months and any infected animals at once removed. Post-calving samples were not taken. The total number of animals which have come under observation is 48, of which 13 have been in the herd for one lactation or less, 16 for two and 19 for three. During this period they have been examined 2 to 9 timesSTUDIES ON BOVINE MASTITIS 365 Comment Of the 23 heifers drafted to this herd at the beginning of 1933, one was found infected at the first test. Twenty-six other heifers have been added and up to the time of this report two have been found to be infected. Although it was hoped that no infection at all would appear in this herd, the results are satis- factory so far as they go and show that when newly-calved heifers are kept apart from older cows the spread of Str. agalactiæ can be prevented. Apart from one heifer which showed some disturbance in two quarters, due to Group III streptococci, the herd has been free from udder disturbance of any kind. THE INCIDENCE OF INFECTION IN COWS OF DIFFERENT AGES In Table 6 is given a summary of the data obtained at the beginning of our work in Herds C, I, J and K, to show the incidence of infection in cows of different ages. In these herds the original incidence of infection was 36.2, 55.1, 29.1 and 53.8 per cent respectively. Whilst the actual figures for age incidence vary somewhat in the individual herds, there is a gradual increase of infection with succeeding lactations, and it is seen that unless precautions are taken to protect heifers from infection as many as 30 per cent may become infected in their first lactation. These findings are similar to those of others, e.g., Seelemann (1932).

366 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, IV DISCUSSION In 1933, Minett, Stableforth and Edwards demonstrated the possibility of assembling a herd of cows free from Str. agalactiæ infection. The initial incidence of infection in the herd concerned (Herd B), which contained 49 cows, was 24.5 per cent, and in 1933 infection had been absent for about three-and-a-half years. At the present date the herd is still free. In 1933, control work was also proceeding in the six herds now being discussed. It was hoped that by the use of similar measures it would be possible to eradicate the disease from these herds or, at least, to reduce the number of new infections to such a point that, with the normal disposal of animals as they got older, final elimination would be in sight. In Herd I our hopes have been realised, since it has now been free from infec- tion for nearly three years. Herds A, C, J and K on the other hand have continued to show new infections, although in all four herds the proportion has steadily fallen whilst the size of the herds has increased. With Herds J and K a number of circumstances have probably contributed to the failure to effect eradica- tion. Thus, the intervals between herd tests had to be prolonged to about six months, post-calving samples were not examined, and freshly drafted cows were not examined at once, and, finally, it was impossible in some cases to remove infected animals to the separate farm for some weeks or months. With Herds A and C there were several factors which increased the difficulties of control. Firstly, although the owners had prescribed strict precautionary measures for preventing spread of disease, a large infected section had to be main- tained in the same or neighbouring sheds. Although it is difficult to see how the precautions taken could have been improved, the results, in conjunction with those of Herd I, suggest that the procedure of keeping infected and non-infected cows in the same or adjoining sheds is less satisfactory than the total removal of infected cows. This accords with the view of Seelemann [1933], that unless infected cows can be quickly evacuated, the removal of infection by suitable treatment is in most cases a valuable and perhaps essential aid to eradication. Secondly, in both herds the retention of Str. agalactiæ infected cows has helped to keep up the size of the infected group. Thus, in Herd A, there has been a large number of cases of clinically evident mastitis due to streptococci other than Str. agalactiæ, apparently arising in a sporadic manner. The Str. agalactiæ infections, on the other hand, were insignificant clinically, and it was not to be expected, therefore, that the owner would evacuate these in preference to the more obviously affected animals. In Herd C, it is to be noted that many infected cows were re- tained much longer than they would have been under ordinary circumstances to their high pedigree breeding value. In Herds A and C the results at first appear to be disappointing. When the data are analysed, however, the results are less discouraging than they appear,
STUDIES ON BOVINE MASTITIS 367 for the following reasons. It should be noted that in 1932 the laboratory control was made more strict and, also, that a selective enrichment medium was introduced capable of detecting very small numbers of streptococci in milk. The considerable increase in the number of new infections revealed in Herds A and C in 1932 may thus be accounted for. It follows at the same time that the incidence of infection prior to 1932 was probably higher than is represented by the figures given. Sub- sequent to 1932 the number of new infections fell, although not so much as was anticipated. In both herds a large number of new infections368 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, IV SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS An account is given of attempts in six herds to control chronic mastitis due to Str. agalactiæ. Latent infections were diagnosed by making cultural tests of the milk in blood agar plates or in a selective enrichment medium, these methods being supplemented by taking the chemical reaction of the milk and by noting the amount and character of the centrifuge sediment. These tests were made at three- to six-monthly intervals and in three herds also shortly after calving. Infected animals were milked after the healthy ones either in the same shed or in another shed on the same premises, or they were removed to another farm and milked by different attendants. One herd (I) in which the original incidence of infection was 55 per cent has now been free for three years, a contributing result being the early sale of most of the infected cows. In three others (C, J and K) in which the original incidence was 40, 30 and 53 per cent respectively, the number of new infections has decreased during four to five years to 9.3, 7 and 7.8 per cent respectively in 1935. Herd L under the same ownership as Herds J and K was built up early in 1933 from freshly-calved heifers and is at present free. In Herd A, the incidence and numbers of new infections were at first low ; the number of new infections rose in 1932, but since then has steadily fallen to 5 . 3 per cent in 1935. The results are discussed in the light of the conditions prevailing in each herd and of the degree of control that could be exercised. For instance, in Herds J and K, although a separate isolation farm was used, the interval between tests could not be less than six months. In Herds A and C infected cows were kept in the same shed as the healthy or in sheds on the same premises, but in both herds, for reasons given, infected cows were retained far longer than would nor- mally have been the case. Actually in Herds J, K, A and C the results are more encouraging than they appear. Thus, in general the new infections due to Str. agalactiæ have been insignificant clinically. Also, the real incidence of infection is at present less than the above statement implies because many cows, in which infection was diagnosed only by means of the enrichment medium and on one occasion only, have now been free from infection for at least two years although in practice they are still regarded as infected. The experience in the present herds and in Herd B of the previous paper [1933] justify the following conclusions :STUDIES ON BOVINE MASTITIS 369 (2) Whilst Str. agalactiæ in nearly all cases leads to permanent infection, it occasionally causes transient infections detectable only by the use of enrichment media. (3) Experience has shown that the disease does not arise sporadically once all known sources of infection are removed. New infections must, therefore, be due to errors in milking or to deficiencies in methods of diagnosis. (4) The formation where possible of a separate heifer herd is a measure of the greatest value.

Med. Assn., 88, 12-23. The authors have demonstrated the possibilites of harnessing the hormones which control the physiological process of reproduction in mammals for therapeutic application in correcting dysfunction of reproductive organs in both sexes in our domestic animals. The hormones concerned in reproduction are Gonadotropic hormone, Oestrin, Corporin, Male-sex hormone and Prolactin. Most of these hormones are ineffective when administered orally, as they are rendered biologically inactive in the gastro-intestinal tract. The gonadotropic hormone is indicated in cases of impotency in males of any species of Mammalia as well as in females that fail to come in heat. This hormone is obtainable from the blood serum of pregnant mares from 37th to 200th day of preg- nancy and from the urine of pregnant women. The authors used pregnant mare serum in their studies as in this material there is no danger of anaphylaxis in other species and no loss of potency in storage. This serum is readily standardized to a concentra- tion of from 50 to 100 Rat units per cubic centimetre and it is very constant in the relative amounts of follicle-stimulating and luteinising principles. One rat unit is the amount that will produce from three to ten mature follicles in each of six immature female rats and half of which amount will fail to produce a vaginal smear of oestrum in a second group of six rats. In ewes and sows 100 to 250 R. U. are sufficient and in the male, approximately double the dose for females is recommended. 750 R. U. are required to produce a physiological reaction in cows and mares. The authors claim good results by the use of this hormone on a stallion, boar and bull that were impotent. In wild animals in captivity, unresponsive males served their mates as early as 24 hours after injec- tion. Oestrin, now available on the market, in sufficient dosage stimulates the uterine musculature to most marked rhythmic contractions and for this reason can be used in causing the evacuation of the uterine contents in cases of pyometra and in increasing the epithelial cell activity in chronic metritis and vaginitis. The authors have not given any data regarding the indications and responses of Corporin and male-sex hor- mone. Prolactin, also available in the market, is indicated in bitches or females of other species that fail to produce milk following parturition. However, this hor- mone has no place in increasing the normal milk flow of a lactating cow. The authors remark that interesting and valuable results can be expected from the use of these products as therapeutic agents when the product to be used is care- fully selected and judicially applied.

In continuation of his first two articles of this series (Abstract in this Journal 6, 305), the author records observations upon aspects of heamaturia. In the light of the existing knowledge upon the mineral metabolism, role of vitamins, blood cons- tituents and the physiological mechanism of clotting and retardation of clotting of blood of normal cattle, each of which has been discussed in detail, the author attempts to explain the causation of the disease and suggests tentative measures of control. The calcium and phosphorus content of blood serum of some healthy and 17 haematuria cases are estimated, and the figures from all the diseased animals are found to be low compared to the normals. The lowest, highest and the average values of calcium in haematuria are given as 6.95, 9.97, and 8.46 mg. per cent respectively and the corresponding figures of phosphoric acid as 11.8, 15.15, and 13.51 mg. per cent. On supplements of calcium and vitamins being given to the affected, these figures showed a rise, contrary to the case of the untreated controls372 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, IV Ephedralin, in a 9 c.c. dose, administered once subcutaneously produced similar results.

Sodium selenite when fed to rats in doses corresponding to 22.3, 33.5 and 52.1 parts of selenium per million of a control wheat diet, developed symptoms of poisoning practically identical with those produced by the natural plant poison found associated with the protein fraction of some cereals. High levels of haemoglo- bin prior to a certain critical period (the ninth to seventeenth day of the experiment) followed usually by a distinct tendency towards anemia, voluntary restriction of food intake adversely affecting the rate of growth and profound pathological changes in the liver, spleen, kidneys and sometimes in the reproductive organs, are some of the main symptoms of selenium poisoning. The toxicity of selenium depends upon its ionic combination and although it has not been definitely proved by the authors that the toxicity of cereal grains is strictly proportional to their selenium content, the results support the view that selenium is closely connected with the natural toxicant. X. Feeding experiments on rats with varying amounts of toxic grain have shown that even a concentration of 17.5 per cent of it in the diet produced depression of growth rates and caused deaths. As the percentage of toxic foodstuffs in the diet was increased, the consumption of food by the animals decreased, followed by retardation of growth rates, pathological lesions and deaths. Rats kept on a diet containing toxic wheat for 30-, 20-, and 10-day periods re- sumed normal growth when they were changed to a control diet of safe grain, but the damage to the organs was never repaired.

K.Sharma, G.P.V.C., is of considerable practical importance. It is a well-authenticated fact that the sorghums and a variety of other fodder plants, including certain grasses, are poisonous to stock in certain circumstances. It is well, therefore, that stock-owners should be warned of the danger and that veterinarians should be informed of ready means of making an accurate diagnosis. From enquiries made by the Director of Veterinary Services, Punjab, at the Hissar Farm, it appears, however, that very large quantities of jowar have been fed to their cattle for many years without mishap. The matter is, therefore, one in regard to which an open mind should be kept but it is clear that the danger of poisoning by such plants should not be lost sight of.374 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, IV Now, according to Mr. Sharma's article, " When there is scarcity of rain, the formaldehyde by simple dehydration gives rise to prussic acid and water ", which would lead to the inference that during droughty weather there is an abun- dance of prussic acid in the jola plant, which makes it unsafe to feed to stock. I have never heard, however, of serious casualties among cattle during this period. The chief fodder for the cattle at the Farm is jola which we grow during the rains and is fed either green or as silage. There has never been a casualty so far through feeding this fodder. On the contrary, it makes excellent green feeding and silage, both of which maintain the milk-yield during times when there is little or no grazing in the pastures. This jola fodder is cut when the flowers open, i. e., when its feeding value is at its highest. The cattle relish it very much and give good returns in milk. A point of interest worth noting is that in Bangalore district the variety of jola grown is the red or "khaki" jola, while that grown in Mysore district and other parts of the State is the white variety, called " bili " jola, the botani- cal species being the same. I have grown and fed green to stock both varieties without any casualties, although the strength of the herd is over 320 head. There seems to be a difference of opinion as to one variety being more poisonous than the other. In any case even among the ryots, it is considered safe to feed green jola to cattle when the flowering stage has been reached, when the jola is said to have little or no prussic acid. Another interesting point is that green jola can and has been fed to or grazed by cattle before the flowering stage has been reached without grave results. Noticing this feature I made enquiries of the local ryots as to why it is not danger- ous to feed green jola before the flowering stage has been reached. The reply given me by an old stager was that jola is safe to feed when one or more inter- nodes have formed on the stalk, which is in reality quite a young stage. More- over, young ratoon jola (second growth that comes after the crop has been cut) has been grazed without dire results. Experience in Mysore State shows that green jola can be fed safely to stock even if the plants have become stunted through drought, a condition that has been rather frequent within the past few years, in Mysore District alone. The ryots from long tradition, which comes of experience, know that green jola is quite safe to feed to stock. In fact, who has not commonly seen a ryot squatting on the ground holding his cattle by the nose-strings and pushing the green jola stalks from a bundle into the animals' mouths ? No harm comes to these animals. This method of feeding is in fact to fatten and bring these animals into condi- tion for show or sale purposes. The feeding of green jola thus shows that, contrary to experiences in the Punjab, there is absolutely no danger, but rather a gain in feeding this kind of fodder,
CORRESPONDENCE 375 We, in Mysore State and South India in general, will become extremely alarmed if articles on sorghum poisoning should prohibit us from feeding stunted, green jola to cattle. If there have been no casualties through feeding green jola, whe- ther well-grown or stunted376 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY [VI, IV I quite agree with Dr. McIsaac that green healthy plants can be fed safely, and it is clearly mentioned in my article that normally it forms a wholesome fodder for animals. The point to discuss is whether the plant when wilted and stunted or under other abnormal conditions mentioned in the article, acquires toxic properties or not. Dr. McIsaac holds that it is absolutely safe to feed the cattle on sorghum under all conditions. Now let us analyse the facts in the light of recent research and analytic works done on sorghum in India and abroad. 1. Tarantino, G. B. (1935) Toxicity of young sorghum, Clin. Vet. Milano. 58, 66-73. Experiments were conducted to determine the variations in toxicity of the plant. One horse, two oxen and two goats were given a diet consisting solely of sorghum which had been grown for 30 days. On the 4th day of feeding the horse and oxen became ill and died unexpected in a short time. 2. Busso,L. (1934) Cyanogenetic plants, sorghum gentile poisoning in cattle. Boll. 1st. Zooprofil, Sper, Turin. March, pp. 34-46. The cyanogenetic compounds occur in plants at the points of greatest meta- bolic activity and their formation is influenced by such factors as light, soil-condi- tions, moisture, etc. Varieties of sorghum have recently been grown in Italy for cattle-fodder and the author records several cases of poisoning. These plants contain a cyanogenetic glucoside and an enzyme which together produce a dangerous amount of prussic acid under certain conditions. In one case, two animals died and several others became ill after they had received a diet consisting solely of sorghum gentile. Young sorghum plants or those grown under unsuitable climatic conditions or on land which has been heavily manured with nitrates are likely to be dangerous. 3. In the Punjab it is commonly known as sokar (stunted) jowar poisoning. Col. G. K. Walker, the late Principal of the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore, says in The Veterinary Bulletin No. 1921, " When crops of jowar suffer from want of water it is found that the leaves of the young plants elaborate a poison. If eaten by cattle the following symptoms are noticed. Dullness followed by tympanites, foaming at the mouth, etc. Death frequently results." 4. Coleman, F. F. (1934) carried out a comprehensive series of analysis for hydrocyanic acid (cyanogenetic glucoside) on several species of sorghum at various stages of growth. In all species hydrocyanic acid content decreased as the plants matured. (For details please see the Rept. Dept. Agri. 1933-34, pp. 144-147). 5. Peters, Slade, and Avery (1903). Poisoning of cattle by common sorghum and Kaffir corn. Nebr. Agr. Sol. Bull. 77 (Experimental station U. S. A.). They say that the poisonous character of the plant was due to the elaboration in it
CORRESPONDENCE 377 of certain compounds capable of decomposing and yielding the poisonous hydro- cyanic acid when masticated and taken into the stomach. A case of a heifer is described which dropped to the ground in ten minutes after having been driven into a sorghum field. 6. Wittman, J. J. and West, R. M. (1915). Notes on the hydrocyanic acid contents of sorghum. Jour. Agric. Research, Vol. 4, p. 179. They have shown that inadequate water supply is usually accompanied by high prussic acid content. Avery says that the amount of hydrocyanic acid is greater in stunted plants. Maxwell believes that soil rich in nitrogen produces plants rich in the glucocides. I would quote a few more experimental works done in the neighbouring pro- vince of Dr. McIsaac, viz., Madras. 7. Acharya, C. N. (1933) Indian Jour. of Agricultural Science, Vol. III, Part V, pp. 851-868. Investigation on the development of prussic acid in cholam (Sorghum, vulgare). He commences his article with "That cholam (Sorghum vulgare) under certain conditions of growth becomes highly poisonous for cattle, has been known for a long time past." He analysed the plant by three different methods and found the highest percentage of prussic acid in stunted Sorghum vulgare plants (vide Table 3, page 855). He further mentions that a field of Peri- amanjal cholam (sorghum) suffering from serious drought and highly stunted (Field No. 77) was taken up for examination, and its prussic acid contents compared with that of cholam growing in the adjacent part of the same field, which had been supplied with drain water and had grown luxuriantly. The stunted plants showed nearly 6 to 7 times the percentage of prussic acid. This effect of drought was examined in a number of other fields also, and in each case it was noticed that drought is one of the factors promoting the accumulation of prussic acid in cholam. 8. Bensen and Sobha Rao (1906) Bull. Dept. of Agriculture, Madras, No. 55. Cholam (sorghum vulgare) is largely used as cattle fodder throughout India, and several deaths of stock have been reported from time to time. Space does not permit of more quotations from the works of different authors, but as Dr. McIsaac is interested in the subject, I give the following references for his information. 1. Slade, H. B.

Dr. Steyn observed in a case of C ynodon transvaalense where the plant growing in moist conditions yielded no prussic acid, whereas the plants growing on a dry ridge showed a strong reaction. 10. Dr. A. C. Leechmann in the Onderstepport Jour. of Vet. Sc. and Anim. Ind. July, 1935, gives a long list of 88 grasses containing prussic acid or cyanogenetic glucoside. In the list six varieties of sorghum have been mentioned, and Sorghum vulgare is one of them. In this article entitled " Hydrocyanic acid in grasses " the author has discussed in detail the influence of climatic condi- tions, wilting, stunting, drought and soil, etc., on the production of hydrocyanic acid and the toxicity of the plants. As Sorghum vulgare has been shown to be toxic, under certain conditions, in several parts of the world, it would appear reasonable to expect similar condi- tions in Mysore. I would, however, like to make a few suggestions regarding this difference found in Mysore. The following points deserve serious consideration :CORRESPONDENCE 379 The beginning of my paper is " The subject of plant poisoning in animals has received very little attention in India, which is mainly due to the difficulty in its diagnosis from the clinical symptoms alone, and the fact that majority of field veterinarians are unable to secure the collaboration of a chemist for ana- lysis of suspected sample of fodder or ingesta. " In my article, stress is laid on chemical tests and a simple test for the detection of hydrocyanic acid is given which is suitable for adoption under field conditions. This would be of a great help in the diagnosis of hydrocyanic acid poisoning. This is not a fact that cases of sorghum poisoning do not occur but they remain undiagnosed. It is regretted that Dr. McIsaac has taken my paper as extremely alarming. I wish to emphasize that it was written merely as a warning against the feeding of wilted and stunted sorghum plants. This warning is not from me only but also from leading research workers and chemists working in the Agricultural and Veterinary Departments in India and abroad. It is especially significant when Mr. Acharya, working in an adjoining province found the highest percentage of hydrocyanic acid present in the stunted sorghum of Madras. What is true of Madras and other countries should apply to Mysore, provided the same conditions favouring the production of hydrocyanic acid exist. Further Dr. McIsaac says that ryots are unable to spend money on sulphur. The stunted jola should be dried in the shade to eliminate hydrocyanic acid before feeding it to cattle. They can certainly do this much, which costs nothing. (Please see my article, page 377*). In South Africa a disease (Geilsiekte) affecting sheep and cattle had been known for a long time, and Brown reported this in 1864, and MacOwen referred to heavy losses caused by this disease in 1877. This condition remained undiag- nosed for a long time even in the hands of experts. It was Dr. Steyn who dis- covered the actual cause of Geilsiekte, for the first time in 1929, to be prussic acid poisoning due to the ingestion of wilted grasses. It is, therefore, not at all sur- prising if cases of sorghum poisoning remain undiagnosed in Mysore or elsewhere. It is not essential that stunted and wilted sorghum fed to cattle may prove toxic or fatal in all cases. There are certain factors which influence the toxicity of sorghum. (For details please see my article, page 377*). It is important both from professional and livestock viewpoints to test the stunted and wilted Jowar, especially when it is young, for the presence of hydrocyanic acid. Cattle having been fed on such sorghum and showing symptoms of poisoning or having died of tympanites within a few hours, should be suspected of hydrocyanic acid poison- ing. The ingesta should be examined by the picrate method mentioned in my article (page 379*) or sent to the Chemical Examiner. Yours, etc., G. K. SHARMA. * Published in the Indian Journal of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry, Vol. V, Pt. IV, December, 1935.
