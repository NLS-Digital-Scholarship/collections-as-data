REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE PUNJAB LUNATIC ASYLUM For the year 1922. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Lahore: PRINTED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT GOVERNMENT PRINTING, PUNJAB. 1923.
No. 16979 (Home2 diagnosis than of any real increase in disease. The tubercular section of the Asylum which was opened in 1921 is reported to be working satisfactorily. 4. There was an increase in the recurring expenditure on the Asylum during the year under report, owing principally to a revision in the pay of the establishment. The income from manufactures shows considerable improvement over the figures reported in 1921. 5. The inadequacy of the existing accommodation for criminal lunatics has received the attention of the Punjab Gov- ernment, and it is hoped that with the construction of the projected new enclosure to accommodate lunatics of this class, anxiety as to overcrowding in the Asylum will be relieved. 6. The thanks of Government are due to Major H. W. V. Cox, I. M. D,. who held charge of the Asylum from 1st January to 13th November 1922, to Captain C. J. Lodge-Patch, I. M.S., who relieved Major Cox and continued in charge for the remainder of the year; and to the Asylum staff, for the efficient manner in which they performed their duties. In particular the unselfish work of the Rev. Mother Superior and the Franciscan Sisters is again worthy of mention. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, A. LATIFI, Secretary to Government, Punjab, Transferred Departments. 316 CSNote on the Statistical Tables of the Punjab Lunatic Asylum for the year 1922. STATEMENT I. Admissions, dis- charges, etc. Population.2 pneumonia for the year 1921 was 5 with 3 deaths, and for 1920, 23 with 10 deaths. 5. The total death rate for the Asylum was 6.69, as com- pared with 11.22 in 1921, and 12.63 in 1920. The figures include three suicides. The high death rates in 1920 and 1921 were due to some extent to epidemics of cholera and influenza which were absent in 1922. STATEMENT II. Criminal Lunatics. 6. In the beginning of the year there were 156 criminal lunatics under treatment. There were 42 admis- sions and re-admissions with 11 deaths and 31 transfers or discharges during the year, leaving 156 inmates of this class under treatment at the end of the year. The accommodation for criminal lunatics has been and still is very limited, but the building of the new criminal enclosure has been started and it is expected that this section will be finished before the end of 1923. The additional barracks will go very far towards relieving the congestion in the Asylum. STATEMENT III. Religion, Sex & Residence. 7. Of the admissions, Hindus accounted for 169, Muham- madans 134, Europeans and Anglo-Indians 6, Indian Christians 5 and other castes 8. STATEMENT IV. Occupation. 8. " Agriculturists " furnished 39 admissions, while 46 are shown under the head " Housewives " and 29 under that of " Labourers ." In 43 cases, the previous occupation was not known. STATEMENT V. Age. 9. As regards age, 30 of the total number of patients admitted were under 20 years, 204 between 20 and 40, 79 between 40 and 60 and 9 above 60. STATEMENT VI. Types of Insanity. 10. The form of this statement was revised in 1921, and the inclusion of "Alternating Insanity" in column 5 enables a certain number of patients who were formerly classed as manias or melancholias to be diagnosed more correctly. STATEMENT VII. Aetiological Fac- tors. 11. The exciting and predisposing causes of the mental illness in the 322 admissions and re-admissions are shown in this statement. As in most years, charas and its derivatives head the list of excit- ing causes with 55 cases. A previous attack is the leading pre- disposing cause with 52 cases, epilepsy in 13 cases, and congeni- tal mental defect in 23 cases. It is satisfactory to note that there were only 101 patients in which the cause was neither assignable nor ascertained, showing that greater care was taken
3 in investigating the histories of the cases admitted. In 1919, 1920 and 1921, there were 145, 186 and 115 cases under these heads, respectively. In Indian Asylums, however, there must always be a certain number of patients with a defective history as a large number are vagrants. Escapes. 12. Two patients managed to escape during the year. They were both non-criminal lunatics and harm- less. They both effected their escape while working in the garden. One has since been brought back to the Asylum. Suicides. 13. Three patients committed suicide by hanging. STATEMENT VIII. Cash accounts. 14. There was an increase on account of salaries as com- pared with the preceding year, amounting to Rs. 3,500 under the head "Superintendence" and Rs. 9,000 under " Establishment," due, in the case of the former, to the enhancement of the pay of the Superintendent and the appointment of a whole-time Deputy and Assistant Deputy Superintendent, and, in the case of the latter, to the introduction during the year of a revised scale of pay for warders. The amount expended on the diet of the patients is approxi- mately the same as that in 1921, viz., Rs. 1,27,000. The cost of clothing of the patients fell by Rs. 6,700 and a reduction was also effected under the heads " Medicines ", " Contingencies proper ", and " Repairs and Maintenance ". The taxes, however, increased by about Rs. 300. A further increase is expected on account of canal water rates for land now brought under culti- vation. An increase in the telephone charges has also to be met. Credits. 15. There is a falling off of Rs. 5,783 in the receipts from paying patients as compared with 1921. The reduction is, however, only nominal, for the sums due from local bodies on behalf of paying patients were actually greater in 1922 than in 1921. The receipts for 1921 included Rs. 5,183, paid direct to the Asylum by the Lahore Municipality instead of by a book adjustment. 16. The Public Works Department charges for minor works and annual repairs amounted to Rs. 12,500 as compared with Rs. 7,000 in 1921, and Rs. 67,000 in 1920, the heavy charges in 1920 being due to the construction of the New Tuber- cular Section. Major Works.4 STATEMENT X. Manufactures. 17. There was a total profit of Rs. 17,800 during 1922, as compared with Rs. 12,000 in 1921, and Rs. 13,000 in 1920. These profits include Rs. 5,100 from the sale of vegetables and garden produce to the Asylum, Rs. 6,700 from the manufacture of blankets, dasuti and munj mats supplied to the patients, and Rs. 875 from the sale of such articles to the public. Miscellaneous items, such as the sale of grass for bullocks, wood for fuel, etc., contri- buted Rs. 4,800 to the total profit, and there was raw material to the value of Rs. 345 in stock at the end of 1922 in excess of the amount in hand on the 1st of January. The profit was due to the reduction in the price of raw material, and to the rise in the market price of garden produce. Acknowledgment. 18. Major H. W. V. Cox, I.M.D., held charge of the Asy- lum from the 1st January to 13th November 1922, and was therefore responsible for the management of the institution for practically the whole of the year. He administered the Asylum with zeal and marked abi- lity. He was succeeded by Captain C. J. Lodge Patch, M.C., I.M.S., a highly trained and experienced Alienist, who has en- tered upon his duties with energy and enthusiasm. Assistant Surgeon Thomas, the Deputy Superintendent, has been tactful and zealous in the performance of his duties, and has ably assisted the Superintendent in the administration of the Asylum. Sub- Assistant Surgeons, Chuni Lal and Bhagwant Ram, have per- formed their duties efficiently. Lala Ram Saran Das, Head Clerk, has continued to perform his duties in a satisfactory manner. The Rev. Mother Superior and the Franciscan Sisters have given another year of devoted and unselfish work in the care of the female inmates of the Asylum in which they have been en- gaged for over 20 years. An extra Sister of their Order joined the staff in the last week of December to admit of the Sisters being granted some leave to the hills in the not weather. She receives no pay except when working in a leave vacancy. LAHORE : R. HEARD, COLONEL, I.M.S., The 24th April 1923. Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab

Proceedings of the Punjab Government (Ministry of Education) in the Home [Medical and Sanitary) Department, No. 14178, dated 16th May 1924. READ.2 4. The profits of manufactures carried on in the Asylum show a creditable increase. They stood at Rs. 12,000 in 1921, Rs. 17,800 in 1922, and Rs. 18,800 in 1923. The possibilities of increasing these profits are, of course, limited, but in view of the heavy cost of the Asylum to Government it is desirable that they should be as large as possible and the Punjab Government (Ministry of Education) are glad to note that the manufactures are being conducted on business lines. 5. This Government desire to place upon record their ap- preciation of the good work done by the late Major J. F. Flem- ing, I.M.D., of whom mention was made in the review on the last triennial report; Major H.W.V. Cox, I.M.D., and Captain C. J. Lodge-Patch, I.M.S., who successively held charge of the Asylum during the period under review. The services of Mr. Thomas, the Deputy Superintendent of the Asylum and the un- selfish devotion of the Revd. Mother Superior and the Fran- ciscan sisters are also worthy of mention. ORDER.Note on the Report of the Punjab Lunatic Asylum, Lahore, for triennium 19212 Acknowledgments. 7. Captain C. J. Lodge-Patch, I. M. S., who is a highly- trained and experienced Alienist, has discharged his onerous and responsible duties with marked zeal and ability. My acknowledgments are due to him and Mr. Thomas, Deputy Superintendent, who ably assisted him in the efficient administration of the Asylum. The Franciscan Sisters in charge of the female Asylum continue to devote themselves to their trying and arduous duties with their usual zeal. LAHORE: E. L. WARD, LIEUT.-COLONEL, I.M.S., Offg.

TRIENNIAL REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE PUNJAB LUNATIC ASYLUM, FOR THE YEARS 1921, 1922 AND 1923. 1. 2 tain sections of the Asylum. One advantage of the new scheme is that, at a later date, the other sections and the Female Asylum can be drained into the new Jhallar. The extension to the Tubercular Section was completed in 1921. The electric lighting of the whole Asylum has been thorough ly overhauled, and certain additions and alterations have been made. There have never been any fire precautions in the Asylum till 1923, when Government sanction was obtained for this pur- pose. Minimax Fire Extinguishers have been installed, and a portable Fire Pump has been purchased. A monthly fire drill is being instituted, so that in the event of an outbreak of fire, there will be no confusion on the part of the attendants and others engaged in putting it out. 3.3 all were formerly kept locked in their cells and barracks for two or three hours during the heat of the day, while their attend- ants were off duty, and violent cases were hardly ever allowed out of their cells. The supervision of the patients by attendants and the nursing staff has been generally smartened up. The rates of pay for attendants has been considerably increased during the last three years, so it is now possible to get more re- liable and trustworthy attendants than before. Formerly, suicidal patients were kept locked in their cells at night, where they had every facility for taking their own lives ; but now, all cases of acute melancholia and all patients who exhibit definite suicidal tendencies are kept in an open Hospital Ward, with trained attendants on duty day and night. It is recognised that this cannot absolutely prevent suicides ; but it should go far towards avoiding the most serious calamity that is apt to occur in an Asylum. Epileptics have all been collected in the Hospital Section, so that they can be satisfactorily nursed. They have special food cooked for them ; salt is left out of their diets, and its place is taken by Potassium Bromide, on the lines suggested by Richet and Toulouse. Every effort has been made to diagnose and treat cases of Tuberculosis at the earliest opportunity. This has increased the number of patients on the Hospital books ; so that the average number of daily sick is now 51.83, whereas in 1921 and 1922, it was 36.13 and 40.61, respectively. Tubercular patients are treat- ed with routine injections of Sodium Morrhuate. This drug has the advantage of being extremely cheap, and appears to be fairly effective. It is too soon to say very much as to the re- sults of treatment, but there have been a certain number of apparent cures. No patient is discharged from the Tubercular Section till the clinical signs of the disease have disappeared, and the sputum is negative to the tubercle bacillus. Occupational Therapy is largely employed, and as many; patients as possible are engaged in gardening and other out- door occupations. But there are so many advanced and hope- less dements in the Asylum that the percentage of working patients is not so high as it might be. In consequence of the greater liberty that the patients now enjoy and the other measures for their comfort and well-being, they appear to be far more contented than they were formerly, and there have been practically no exhibitions of acute violence or extreme depression within the last twelve months.
4 5.5 Rs. 382,977 is on account of work done by the Public Works Department. The new Criminal Section has cost over three lakhs, and more than half a lakh was paid in 1923 as compen- sation for the 48 acres of land acquired in 1921. The amounts received from the Treasury in 1921, 1922 and 1923, respectively, are Rs. 2,30,911, Rs. 2,30,011 and Rs. 2,27,874. The latter figure indicates a considerable re- duction in the cost of upkeep of the Asylum, particularly when it is remembered that the average number of patients in the institution was 33 more in 1923 than in the two previous years, and that the amount paid as salaries of the medical staff and personnel has been doubled in the last four years. In the triennial report for the years 19186 The cases of dysentery and diarrhoea comprise a large pro- portion of the admissions to hospital for sickness. There were 328 cases with 53 deaths, as compared with 442 admissions and 114 deaths for the period 1918STATEMENTS.

No. 14187 (H.2 3. The increase in the number of cases discharged as cured,Note on the Statistical Tables of the Punjab Mental Hospital, Lahore, for the year 1924. Statement I.2 3. There has been an epidemic of Plague and Cholera in Lahore and one case of each of these diseases occurred in the attendants' quarters of this Institution. By prompt measures which included the inoculation of all the staff and patients, isola tion of contacts, etc., the disease was, in each instance, limited to that single case. No patients and no member of the staff was affected either by Cholera or Plague. There was also the possibility of an epidemic of Rinder- pest among the cattle. One of the hospital bulls was found to be suffering from this disease and it is surprising that others were not infected, considering the extremely bad arrangements which exist for housing the cattle. However, it is satisfactory to note that energetic sanitary precautions prevented the spread of this disease. Statement II.3 Improvements in Water supply and Sanitation. 6. For many years past there have been frequent com- plaints about the scarcity of water, particularly in hot weather. During the last year, however, this has been completely and permanently re- lieved. One of the old wells has been converted into a tube well and an electric motor has been installed which enables water to be pumped into tanks which have been fitted on the roof of the hospital section. This provides a sufficient head of water to enable those sections of the hospital, where the scarcity of water was greatest, to receive an ample supply. The drainage system of the male hospital has been com- pletely overhauled. Dis posal of sullage was formerly effected by an unsanitary sump and jhalar. These have been re- placed by cement plastered brick-work tanks and a duplicate set of electric motors. There was some difficulty in obtaining electric power at first, but this was overcome by the temporary installation of an oil engine and centrifugal pump. The drain- age of several of the sections of the male hospital has been com- pletely overhauled and connected up with the new disposal work referred to above, and plans have been prepared for con- necting up the rest of the male hospital and the whole of the female hospital with the new system The victim of death by violence was sleeping in barrack with about 20 other patients. A patient who slept beside him and who had never previously shown signs of being dangerous or aggressive suddenly awoke and sprang upon the sleeping Amir Ali's chest. The patient died instantaneously, and at the post-mortem examination, it was discovered that the external marks of injury were very slight but that the cause of death was rupture of the heart.

Suicides, acci- dents and death by violence. 7. During 1924, there were two suicides and one death by vielence. Both the cases of suicide were effected by the patients suspending one loop of their jangia (drawers) over the top of a door and inserting their neck through the other loop. One of the cases was due entirely to the gross negligence of the attendant. This patiert was extremely depressed and had attempted to commit suicide in various ways on 3 or 4 previous occasions. He was placed in the suicidal ward and the attend- ant on duty had received orders that he was on no account to leave the ward for a single moment. He failed to carry out these orders and during his temporary absence, the patient succeeded in hanging himself. The other case was not regarded as suicidal and no special surveillance was placed upon him. The victim of death by violence was sleeping in an open barrack with about 20 other patients . A patient who slept beside him and who had never previously shown signs of being dangerous or aggressive suddenly awoke and sprang upon the sleeping Amir Ali's chest. The patient died instantaneously, and at the post-mortem examination, it was discovered that the external marks of injury were very slight but that the cause of death was rupture of the heart.

No. 15534 (H.2 prevalence of these diseases is attributed to the large number of flies in the premises. There are a number of causes which con- tribute to the breeding of flies, such as the presence of a cowshed and a large number of trees in the institution, and the defective system of trenching and disposal of cow manure. Steps have how- ever been taken to remedy some of these defects, and it is expected that the remaining defects will be removed as soon as possible. A water carriage system of conservancy for the female section is now under consideration, and it is hoped that it will be possible to adopt it for the whole hospital in course of time. 5. The expenditure per head of the daily average popul- ation, excluding expenditure on work done by the Public Works Department, amounted to Rs. 305 and shows a further increase of Rs. 11 over the previous year's figure. The question of reducing the cost of the hospital is engaging the attention of Government. It is, however, satisfactory to note that the income from garden produce and manufactured articles showed con- siderable improvement. Contributions received from paying patients also showed an increase of Rs. 1,693 on the figures of the previous year. 6. The thanks of the Punjab Government (Ministry of Education) are due to Captain C. J. Lodge Patch, M.C., I.M.S. who was in charge as Medical Superintendent till the 15th September 1925, and to Captain T. H. Thomas, I.M.S., who succeeded him, for the efficient manner in which they per- formed their duties. The unselfish devotion of the Reverend Mother Superior and the Franciscan Sisters in the hospital is again worthy of mention. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, RAM CHANDRA, Offg. Secretary to Government, Punjab, Transferred Departments. 255 CS-260Note on the Statistical Tables of the Punjab Mental Hospital, Lahore, for the year 1925. Statement I.2 Director of Public Health has made an official inspection and has recorded his opinion that the trenching system of conser- vancy in vogue is very faulty. He has suggested a system of deep trenching, which has since been carried out. He has also pointed out that the present means of disposal of cow manure is unsatisfactory, and has made suggestions for remedying the defect. He has further expressed the opinion that there is a larger number of trees in the Institution than is necessary from the point of view of shade, the superfluity causing many flies to collect, and has recommended that the cutting down of certain of them should be undertaken. There is no doubt also that the cow-shed, which is at present within the walls of the Institution, has been responsible for attracting numerous flies. This latter defect, however, is soon to be remedied. The construction of a new cow-shed of a much improved pattern has now been sanctioned by Government, and will be undertaken early in 1926. The Director of Public Health has suggested that the present system of conservancy be replaced by a water carriage system. Such a system is at present under consideration for the new wing of the Female Mental Hospital, which is about to be built. The extension of the system to the whole Hospital will eventually effect a great improvement in the general health of the patients. As regards the sanitation of the Hospital surroundings, it is considered that a potent cause of sickness is the extremely insanitary condition of the Mian Mir Channel, which passes through the grounds of the Hospital, and runs between the Male and Female divisions. It is a fertile breeding ground for all varieties of mosquitos. Although the death rate from Malaria in itself is low, there is no doubt that this disease seriously undermines the health of the patients and renders them more liable to diseases of a more acutely dangerous nature. This defect is now receiving the attention of the authorities concerned. Another matter of considerable importance is that there is definite overcrowding in the attendants' quarters. This matter has already received attention and the construction of 15 addi- tional quarters will be undertaken shortly. More quarters will, however, be needed for the extra attendants to be attached to the new Criminal Section, and the matter will be referred to Government in due course. Suicides, accidents and deaths by violence. 5. There were no suicides, accidents and deaths by violence during the year under report. There was only one escape.

No. 15563 (H.Proceedings of the Punjab Government (Ministry of Local Self- Government) in the Home (Medical) Department, No. 15562, dated the 23rd May 1927. READ2 led to a decline in the number of fresh admissions could be re- garded with some degree of satisfaction, but the improvement in the accommodation effected during the past three years by the construction of a new criminal section and of a hospital section for women and in other ways makes it no longer necessary to dis- courage fresh admissions. Every effort should therefore be made to render it possible to reduce fees so as to make the treatment of the mentally afflicted in this the only institution of its kind in the province available on as wide a scale as is practicable. 2. The percentage of the daily average strength discharg- ed as cured declined from 16.45 in 1924 to 14.11 in 1925 and 11.47 in 1926, but the report is silent as to the reasons for this decrease. The death-rate, on the other hand; after rising from 11.31 per cent of the daily average population in 1924 to 14.23 per cent in 1925 fell to 9.25 per cent in 1926. During 1925 no less than 123 deaths occurred of which over half were due to dysentery and diarrh3 Fund for the provision of extra comforts and amenities for the patients, and Government wish to acknowledge the generosity of His Highness the Maharaja of Patiala, His Highness the Raja of Faridkot and Sir Edward Maclagan among others who have contributed to this fund. They also wish once again to place on record their appreciation of the devotion of the Mother Superior and the Franciscan Sisters who look after the female section of the hospital. The thanks of Government are also due to the visitors, official and non-official, for the important and somewhat unpleasant public service which they perform. ORDER.Note on the Report of the Punjab Mental Hospital, Lahore, for the triennium 1924-1926. THE report forwarded, herewith, relates to the triennial period 19242 mortality due to intestinal infections. The decrease is attri- butable to the improved method of conservancy which has been adopted since the beginning of 1926. The number of cases under treatment in hospital was 52.17 in 1924, 50.64 in 1925, and 71.81 in 1926, while the percentage of deaths to daily average strength was 11.31, 14.23 and 9.25. The incidence of malaria, which was greater in 1926 than in any year since the institution was established, is responsible for the increased number of admissions in hospital. This large increase appears to be due to the state of the storm water channel which runs between the male and female sections and continues past the Central Jail. Owing to the insufficient grading, stagnating water remains in its bed all the year round and is a menace to health of the inmates of the hospital and staff. Acknowledgments. 7. Captain C. J. Lodge-Patch, M.C., I.M.S., and Captain 1. H. Thomas, I.M.S., who held charge of the responsible office of Medical Superintendent during the triennium, discharged their onerous duties with marked zeal and energy. Dr. G. W. Hardy, Deputy Medical Superintendent and other members of the staff ably assisted the Medical Superintendent in the efficient administra- tion of the Mental Hospital. My acknowledgments are due to all these officers and to the Rev. Mother Simon and the Fran- ciscan Sisters, whose unselfish devotion is worthy of special mention. C. R.

Triennial Report of the Punjab Mental Hospital for the years 1924,1925 and 1926. I. Population.2 similar structure in the Province. It is hoped that in the course of time the institution will be able to have its own herd of milch cows. III. The Female Mental Hospital. 3 year round, and this water is continually polluted by sewage and sullage. This storm water channel is a menace to the health and well being of more than five thousand individuals, and the sanita- tion of this area can never be regarded as satisfactory until this source of danger is removed. The enormous increase in the number of cases of malaria admitted to the hospital wards is directly due to this source of infection. There is also a consider able wastage of staff owing to sickness during the malaria season. V. Escapes, suicides and deaths from violence.4 Government sanction was obtained for an initial and recurring grant in order to purchase books of reference and standard text-books on mental and nervous diseases. A small and excellent medical library which will be added to each year keeps the medical staff up to date in their knowledge of the diseases they are called on to treat. While on leave last year, the Medical Superintendent was deputed to visit many of the mental hospitals in the United Kingdom in order to obtain ideas for improving the local institution. Numerous ideas have been obtained and are embodied in a separate report. The most outstanding feature in which the Punjab Mental Hospital lags behind similar hospitals in Europe is in the severity of its architecture. It has previously been remarked that the only way in which this institution could be made to look more like a hospital and less like a jail would be to pull it down and rebuild it. The report of the deputation, however, contains certain suggestions for converting, at a very small cost, the present hideous criminal section into what could be a very comfortable and convenient hospital section. Several other recommendations have also been put forward in the hope that this institution may yet be brought into line with modern mental hospitals. VII. Benevolent Fund.5 For the entertainment of the patients, a small cinematograph projector has been purchased, and a library consisting of a few hundred books in English and in the vernacular has also been started. VIII. Sickness and Mortality.6 admissions to the Punjab Mental Hospital who have evidently been infected in their own homes. Last year has been exceptional in that tuberculosis in one form or another has been the greatest individual cause of death. The incidence of malaria was much greater in 1926 than in any year since the institution was built. The figures for 1924, 1925, and 1926, under this head, are, respectively, 24 cases, with 2 deaths, 34 cases, with 4 deaths, and 135 cases, with 5 deaths. This enormous increase appears to be directly due to the abominable state of the Mian Mir storm water channel to which reference has been made in a previous page. These cases of malaria have increased the numbers of daily sick, which are 52.17, 50.64 and 71.81 in the three successive years. The death rate, however, in spite of the large number of daily sick, and the unusually high mortality from pneumonia and tuberculosis, shows a satisfactory decrease. The percentages of deaths to the daily average strength for 1924, 1925 and 1926 are 11.31, 14.23 and 9.25, respectively. IX. Cash Accounts.STATEMENTS.

No. 695-S. (Medl.). FROM J. G. BEAZLEY, ESQ., I.C.S., Secretary to Government, Punjab, Transferred Departments, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, HOME DEPARTMENT, SIMLA. Dated 2nd June 1928. Medical. SUBJECT :2 claimed fewer victims than in 1926, but the general sick rate was considerably higher, amounting to 11 per cent. of the daily average population as compared with 8 per cent. in the previous year. The condition of the Mian Mir storm water channel continues to exercise a most unwholesome effect on the health of the staff and inmates of the Mental Hospital, but the improve- ment of this drain has now been taken up by the Rural Sanitary Board and it may be hoped that the present year will see an abatement of this nuisance. 4. The cost per head of the daily average population, excluding all expenditure on buildings and other works, amounted to Rs. 267, as compared with Rs. 263 in 1926. The net expendi- ture from provincial revenues after taking credit for recoveries from local bodies and from paying patients was, however, less than half of this, amounting to about Rs. 1,02,000 out of about Rs. 2,37,500. Investigations made during the year in respect of the cost of the institution showed that, while expenditure per patient in this province is more than the expenditure in the United Provinces and the Central Provinces, it is considerably less than the expenditure in other provinces, and that, if the Hospital is to be modernized and run on up-to-date lines, a considerable increase of expenditure will have to be faced. Details are now being worked out with a view to the adoption of a programme of gradual improvement which will be within provincial means. 5. The thanks of Government are due to Major C. J. Lodge- Patch, M.C., I.M.S., who was in charge of the hospital as Medical Superintendent throughout the year, for the sympathy and zeal with which he has carried out his duties. He was ably assisted by the other members of the staff, including the Franciscan sisters, who as before, devotedly looked after the women patients. The institution suffered a great loss during the year owing to the death of Revd. Mother Simon, who had worked for the Hospital for nearly twenty-five years. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, J. G. BEAZLEY, Secretary to Government, Punjab, Transferred Departments. 431 CSNote on the Statistical Tables of the Punjab Mental Hospital, Lahore, for the year 1927. STATEMENT I.2 The report of Major Lodge-Patch, Superintendent of the Hospital and Mr. Ram Chandra, I. C. S., who were deputed by the Punjab Government (Ministry of Local Self-Govern- ment) to visit mental hospitals in other provinces was received during the year and is under the consideration of Govern- ment. The so-called " Hospital Section " is not suited for the treatment of patients ; and the Superintendent has made pro- posals for re-modelling the buildings so as to make them suitable for modern methods of treatment of mental patients. Sanitation. 5. Reference has been made in the previous paragraph to the water carriage system which has been in- stalled in the Female Mental Hospital and is working satisfactorily ; the nuisance of insanitary open drains has been abolished, and it is hoped that a similar system of sanitation will be introduced on the male side in due course. The sanitary condition of the Mental Hospital will continue to be unsatisfactory until the Mian Mir Storm Water Channel is prevented from being a breeding ground of mosquitoes. The Director of Public Health has been asked to recommend measures for dealing with this menace to the health of the patients in the hospital and other inhabitants of the neigh- bourhood. Suicides, Fatal Accidents and deaths by violence. 6. During 1927 there were no deaths by violence; and no fatal accidents. There were 3 escapes during the year under report but all the patients were recovered. A large number of patients attempted to escape. A dangerous strongly built Pathan, Abdul Manan, escaped one night from the Criminal Section and succeeded in getting over the inner wall. He was seen in the early hours of the morning by the jamadar sweeper, Bali, a very small man blind in one eye. Bali pluckily grappled with the criminal, was thrown down but again seized him giving the alarm at the same time. The Deputy Commissioner awarded him an inam of Rs. 25. STATEMENT VI3 in the annual increments in pay of the staff, travelling allowance and leave salary. The amount deposited in the Treasury in 1927 was Rs. 12,948, i.e., Rs. 800 more than the previous year under the head "Receipts from paying patients" which is satisfac- tory. The actual net cost of maintenance of the Hospital was Rs. 2,37,492 of which about Rs. 1,22,000 is expected to be re- covered from local bodies, etc. The net cost to the Punjab Gov- ernment is, therefore, about Rs. 1,15,000 excluding the cost of buildings.

No. 883-S. (Medl.) FROM ALAN MITCHELL, ESQ., I.C.S., Offg. Secretary to Government, Punjab, Transferred Departments, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, HOME DEPARTMENT, SIMLA. Dated the 30th May 1929. Medical SUBJECT :2 vious years. The number of patients discharged increased from 218 during 1927 to 232 in the year under review but of these only 119 were discharged as cured against 132 in the pre- vious year. 3 The health of the inmates of the hospital was some- what better than in the previous year, the daily average number of sick persons being 81 against 102 in 1927. There were 33 deaths from pneumonia against 19 in the previous year, the percentage of deaths to the number of pneumonia cases being almost 50 per cent. as against approximately 33 per cent. in the previous year. The percentage of deaths to daily average strength was, however, lower being 10.64 as against 11.45 in 1927. The Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals is of the opinion that the mortality figures would have been lower still had not the vitality of the patients been considerably reduced by the excessive heat during the summer. 4. The total cost of maintenance of the hospital, including all charges, was nearly Rs. 2,80,000. Of this amount Rs. 1,19,000 approximately is to be recovered from local bodies and Rs. 17,200 was received from paying patients. The net cost to Government was Rs. 1,43,800 which includes expenditure to the extent of Rs. 65,865 incurred by the Public Works Department. The cost of maintenance per head of the daily average population, excluding expenditure on buildings and other works, amounted to Rs. 224 as against Rs. 267 in the previous year. 5. The thanks of the Punjab Government (Ministry of Local Self-Government) are due to Major C. J. Lodge- Patch, M.C., I.M.S., who was in charge of the hospital, as Medical Superintendent, for the efficient manner in which he has performed his duties, and to the other members of the staff for the smooth working of the hospital. The devotion of the Reverend Mother Superior and the Franciscan Sisters in the hospital is again worthy of mention. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant, ALAN MITCHELL, Offg. Secretary to Government, Punjab, Transferred Departments. 402 CS-225Note on the statistical tables of the Punjab Mental Hospital, Lahore, for the year 1928. STATEMENTS I. - Admissions, Dis- charges, etc. 1. Population.2 Accommodation. 4. The new Hospital, to which reference was made in the last two annual reports, has been occupied and there is no longer any overcrowding on the female side. Relief has also been obtained on the male side by opening the section which was completed in 1924. It had hitherto been impossible to occupy it as no extra staff was sanctioned. Sanitation. 5. No system of sanitation can ever be regarded as perfect or complete until the Mian Mir Storm Water Channel is abolished altogether. From time to time efforts have been made, with very limited funds, to regrade the channel, but none of these has been effective. The vegetation grows so rapidly and the channel is liable to so many sources of contamination, that any steps to make it wider and deeper have only served to make it a greater source of danger to the health of the community who have the misfortune to live on its banks. This channel has now been taken over by the Irrigation Department, and it should be possible to devise some means of introducing the storm water from Mian Mir into the Bari Doab Canal. This will enable it to be used for irriga- tion and will do away with the very insanitary and dangerous drain, which runs past the Punjab Mental Hospital, the Central and Female Jails, and the Borstal Institution. The water carriage system installed in the Female Mental Hospital is working very satisfactorily. The open drains and sewers on the male side continue to menace the health of the patients. A scheme has been prepared for a water carriage system for the three Jails in the vicinity of this institution, and a similar provision should also be made for the male side of the Mental Hospital at a very early date. Suicides, fatal accidents and deaths by violence. 6. There were no suicides or escapes in 1928 and only one fatal accident, which was investigated by a Magistrate, occurred during the year.

Proceedings of the Punjab Government (Ministry of Local Self-Government) in the Home (Medical) Department, No. 20452, dated the 26th June 1930. READ2 their appreciation of the self-sacrifice and devotion of the Franciscan sisters working in the female section of the hospital. ORDER.Note on the Report of the Punjab Mental Hospital, Lahore, for the triennium 19272 were estimated as suitable for about 500 patients at a rate of 50 square feet of floor space per patient in some of the older wards. This scale is quite inadequate for mental patients. Even in Jails, the space allotted to convicts in the ordinary barracks is 75 square feet and in the Jail Hospitals the minimum is 130 square feet. Accordingly the accommodation of the institution has been re-assessed on a very conservative scale of 70 square feet per patient and it is not estimated to be more than 1,018. The proportion of single rooms to the general accommodation is far higher than is necessary or advisable, and suggestions are under consideration of the Public Works Department to convert a number of the rows of cells into narrow hospital wards. A Committee has been appointed by the Punjab Government to consider what steps are necessary to reconstruct the Mental Hospital so as to make it conform to modern requirements. Among other recommendations are a new hospital section on the male side, a tubercular block for the female side, isolation wards, and a new block for private and better class patients. Sanitation. 5. Some reference must be made to the Mian Mir Storm Water Channel and to the necessity for a water carriage system on the male side (vide Medical Superintendent's report). The wards of the present hospital section on the male side are so badly lighted and ventilated that they militate against the recovery of a patient suffering from acute pneumonia. The Mian Mir Storm Water Channel runs through the atten- dant's lines and the incidence of Malaria is so great among the staff that the Medical Superintendent experiences great difficulty in finding relief for those who are temporarily off duty on account of sickness. Suicides, escapes and deaths from violence. 6. Considering the fact that no restraint and practically no seclusion is employed in the Punjab Mental Hospital the record for the year is extremely satisfactory. This can be attributed to the slight increase in the attendant staff sanctioned with effect from 1st April 1929, as this necessarily provides better care and supervision. There was only one escape and two accidental deaths in 1929. Types of insanity. 7. Table VI shows the types of insanity admitted to the Punjab Mental Hospital during 1929. It differs very little from former years, but it is gratifying to note that the recoveries form 15.84 per cent. of the average daily strength as compared with 12.53 in 1928, and 14.48 in 1927.
3 Cash accounts. 8. The cost of maintenance under head of " Diet" is considerably greater than in 1928, but compares favourably with the expenditure in 1927, when it is borne in mind that the average num- ber of patients was 1,010 as compared with 889. The in- crease over 1928, is due to the fact that the tenders for the supply of provision were called for at a time when the rate was exceptionally high owing to floods and famine. Also there has been a greater number of patients to feed and clothe. The cost under the head of diet in 1927, 1928 and 1929, were approximately Rs. 99,000, Rs. 81,000 and Rs. 98,500, respectively. Another cause for the great discrepancy between 1928 and 1929 is the fact that Rs. 2,000 due to the milk contractor was not drawn in 1928 owing to the receipt of prohibitory orders from court. This amount had to be drawn and paid to the court in 1929, so that the cash for 1928 and 1929 should have been Rs. 83,000 and Rs. 96,500 and this reduces the difference by Rs. 4,000. As anticipated in the last annual report there has been a great increase in the " Receipts from Paying Patients," the figures for the last three years being respectively Rs. 13,000, Rs. 17,000 and Rs. 33,000. The actual net cost of maintenance for the year 1929, including expenditure on diet, establishment, clothing and bedding, &c., amounted to Rs. 2,59,733 as compared with Rs. 2,30,224 in 1928. The increase is largely explained by the fact that practically no blankets were accounted for during the calendar year 1928, where- as two consignments each amounting to nearly Rs. 7,000 were paid for in March and October 1929. If these payments were distri- buted according to the two financial years the apparent increase of Rs. 29,500 would be reduced by Rs. 14,000. It is anticipated that Rs. 1,57,684 will be recovered from Dis- trict Boards, Municipalities, Cantonments, Notified Areas, Small Towns, the Punjab and Rajputana States and private paying patients as compared with Rs. 1,18,068 in 1928. Thus the net cost to Government is Rs. 1,02,049 as against Rs. 1,12,156 in 1928. Manufactures. 9. The net value of the manufactures, &c., during 1929, was Rs. 28,571-2-9, as compared with Rs. 19,404-14-11 in 1928. The increase is attri- buted to the greater amount of garden produce grown in 1929. No vegetables had to be purchased from the market during the year. The total profits for the year were Rs. 19,579-4-1 as com ared with Rs. 13,125-9-2 in 1928.

Punjab.
Triennial Report of the Punjab Mental Hospital for the years 1927,1928 and 1929. THE triennium under review is of particular interest since it reflects a new and very much more enlightened point of view in regard to the treatment of the insane in the Punjab. In the last triennial report, a note was recorded to the effect that the cost of maintenance was too high and that considerable economies should be effected in the future. But after due consideration of the re- ports of two deputations carried out by the Medical Superin- tendent in 1926 and 1927, the Government has come to the con- clusion that the local institution is not altogether a credit to the province, and that a considerable increase of expenditure will have to be faced if the Hospital is to be modernised and run on up-to- date lines (vide Annual Report, 1927). 2. With this object in view, and on the representation of Major-General Megaw, the late Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab, certain additions were made to the inadequate subordinate staff with effect from 1st April, 1929. Further, a Committee has been appointed with the object of making recommendations for reorganising and reconstructing the Hospital. Some reference will be made in the succeeding paragraphs to certain of the matters which have been considered by this highly qualified and competent Committee. 3. As one more indication of the progressive attitude of the Government, it is veryg ratifying to note that the Deputy Medical Superintendent, Dr. R. S. Sharma, has been sent to the United Kingdom to gain experience of the working and administration of British Mental Hospitals. Up to the present, the Medical Super- intendent has been the only individual with any knowledge and experience of what is done in more civilised countries. And his whole time is so much occupied with administrative work and office routine that he has literally no time to devote to the clinical treatment of a thousand patients. A second skilled and properly- trained alienist has been a crying need for many years past. 4. A reference to the tables showing " Establishment " in former years will indicate many inadequacies, e.g., one cook for a hospital containing over a thousand patients, one gatekeeper, etc. It has, of course, been utterly impossible to manage with such shortages of miscellaneous staff, and the only solution of the diffi- culty has been the employment of attendants on certain special occupations. This reduced the supervision of an already insufficient nursing staff, and the welfare of the patients suffered. A few more posts still need to be created. But already, since the increase sanc- tioned on 1st April, 1929, a great stride forwards has been made in
2 the proper care and management of mental patients in this hos- pital. Up to the last year, it was nearly always necessary to keep a few of the more turbulent or troublesome patients secluded for a portion of the day. But now it is no longer necessary to keep a single male patient in his room during the hours of daylight. II. Accommodation, new buildings, etc.,8 The so-called New Criminal Section, completed in 1924, re- mained empty for many years, but the increase of staff has made it possible to occupy it during 1928. It is a forbidding looking section, built on strictly orthodox Jail lines, and is greatly inferior in every way to the New Female Hospital mentioned above. The Committee is considering the question of dismantling some of the older, more obsolete, and insanitary structures, and replacing them with up-to-date and hygienic Hospital wards for general and specialised forms of therapy. The existing Male Hos- pital is so badlyl ighted and ventilated that it is impossible satisfac- torily to treat the large number of cases of pneumonia and other acute diseases which carry off so many mental patients each year. The accommodation for attendants has always been very re- stricted and it is urgently necessary that an extension should be made to the staff quarters. A temporary chappared barrack was built towards the end of 1929 and has been occupied by a number of unmarried male attendants. IV. Sanitation.4 scathing remarks have been made on this subject, but it would appear from most recent correspondence that nothing can be done completely to abolish the nuisance. The discharge from a Dhobi Ghat has been diverted into the water-carriage system on the female side, and twenty new latrines are to be provided for the attendants and their families who continue, to use this drain as a convenience. But the Director of Public Health has pointed out that the complete elimination of sewage will be attended by an increase in the incidence of malaria. The mosquitoes which carry malaria breed only in clean water, so the mere purification of the channel will not be an unmixed blessing. V. Suicides, escapes and fatal accidents.5 friable spleens. One death from violence during 1929 is of suffi- cient interest to record. Rahim Gul, a devout Pathan, overheard a harmless demented patient express the delusion that he was God- He took him apart and argued " if you are God, you can strike me down dead." Gokal Chand replied that he did not desire to do anything so violent. Thereupon Rahim Gul remarked " if you are God, it will be impossible for me to kill you." And suggested an experiment to which the unfortunate Gokal Chand willingly agreed. They went behind one of the barracks, and the latter helped Rahim Gul to adjust the sleeve of his kurta around his throat. Rahim Gul thereupon strangled him. He has no regret whatever for his deed and discusses its execution with complete sang-froid. The routine magisterial enquiry has been held. VI. Occupations and employment.6 Mental Hospital every Sunday and plays a selection of music to the patients, who greatly appreciate this. Till recently, a great wastage of the working hours of the staff occurred each month when attendants and menials had to be given a day's leave in order to purchase their month's supply of provisions from the city. Now, however, a small shop has been opened at which all ordinary commodities and a few luxuries can be obtained. The prices and the quality of the articles sold are under the super- vision and control of the Hospital authorities. Very few contributions have been received for the benevolent fund, but this is probably due to the fact that nothing is done to advertise the institution or to bring it to the notice of the general public. Many thousands of insane are at large in this province, starving, neglected or maltreated. All these are potential dissem- inators of physical and mental ill-health for future generations, and some provision should be made for them. A course of lectures was arranged in the summer of 1929 for general practitioners, members of the Indian Mental Hygiene Association and others interested in the care, treatment and welfare of the insane, so that some interest might be aroused in the saddest of all human afflic- tions. But only about 25 members of the general public attended. DAIED LAHORE : C. J. LODGE-PATCH, MAJOR, I.M.S., The 17th March 1930. Medical Superintendent, Punjab Mental Hospital.

Proceedings of the Punjab Government (Ministry of Education) in the Home (Medical) Department, No. 27449, dated the 8th September 1931. READ2 3. Paragraph 8 of the report which deals with the financial aspect, needs some explanation. The real net cost of maintenance for the year was Rs. 2,01,871; this being the result of deducting from the total ex- penditure of Rs. 2,70,158-5-6 amounts realized from States and provinces and on account of fees paid by patients (Rs. 68,287). The figures, Rs. 2,44,442, men- tioned in the report, were arrived at after deducting from the total expenditure Rs. 25,716 on account of building charges and not the above mentioned sum of Rs. 68,287, whereas to arrive at the net maintenance charges it is clearly necessary to include the cost incur- red on the building, but to exclude the receipts above mentioned. The correct figures as thus estimated for 1929 were Rs. 2,32,769, and therefore there has been a decrease of nearly Rs. 31,000 in the maintenance cost. The net cost to Government is not shown in the report. In the reviews on the reports for 1928 and 1929, the net cost to Government is given as Rs. 1,12,156 and Rs. 1,02,049, respectively. This year the total has risen surprisingly to Rs. 2,01,871. But this is due to the fact that out of Rs. 1,77,477 recoverable by Govern- ment from local boards, States, provinces, and fee pay- ing patients only Rs. 66,642 had been recovered by the end of the year ; and it appears that in previous years the whole of the amount recoverable was regarded as recovered for the purpose of estimating the net cost to Government. In future the actual net cost to Government will be shown in each report. 4. At first sight, it is difficult to understand why, as stated in paragraph 8 (2) of the report, receipts from private paying patients should, because the Accoun- tant-General declined to effect recoveries from certain provinces and insisted on the Medical Superintendent receiving direct payments, have increased by Rs. 33,000. The explanation of this mystifying comment is that the amounts recovered from provinces by the Medical Superintendent are lumped together with the amounts "received from paying patients " in column 3, because in the prescribed form no separate column for such receipts exists. Actually only Rs. 28,536-6-7 was re- covered from patients for fees during the year, the rest of the total in column 3 consisting of recoveries from States and provinces and of a small amount recovered
3 from the persons of patients and utilized for their main- tenance charges. Arrangements will be made for an amendment of the form in future. 5. It is gratifying to note that during the year 157 patients were discharged cured and 82 improved. This argues the success of the efforts, described in the last triennial report, to distract the attention of the patients and work and amusement; and the extra profits from garden work and manufactures are from this point of view doubly satisfactory. 6. The thanks of the Punjab Government (Ministry of Education) are once more due to Major Lodge-Patch, I. M. S., who was in charge throughout the year, and to the staff under him. During the year the Deputy Medical Superintendent, Dr. R. S. Sharma, was still absent on study leave. On his return the hospital should benefit from the presence of a second trained alienist.

No. 1084-S. (Medl.) FROM C. V. SALUSBURY, ESQ., I.C.S., Secretary to Government, Punjab, Transferred Departments, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, HOME DEPARTMENT. Dated Simla, the 7th June 1932. Medical. SUBJECT:2 being 122. Death was mainly due to pneumonia (31), influenza (16), tuberculosis (11) and status epilepticus (6). There was only one death from diarrh3 7. The total expenditure incurred on the main- tenance of the hospital, including that incurred by the Public Works Department on buildings, was Rs. 2,92,688 against Rs 2,70,158 during the previous year. The in- crease is due to the additional expenditure shown to have been incurred upon diet, clothing and bedding and bazar medicines, and to the altered procedure whereby the cost of supplying diet, etc., to " paying " patients is now shown as a charge against provincial revenues The net cost of the maintenance of the institution, how- ever, was Rs. 2,11,593 (and not Rs. 1,10,063 15-11 as shown by the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals) against Rs. 2,01,871 during 1930. There was, however, a large amount (Rs. 1,04,136) outstanding as recoverable, and if the total amount due from other authorities had been recovered during the year under report, the net cost of maintenance of the hospital would have been Rs. 1,07,457. This figure, however, would not correctly represent what the net cost of maintenance to Govern- ment should have been, for the amount recoverable from other authorities included arrears due in respect of previous years. The cost of maintenance per head of patient during the year 1931 was Rs. 294-12-0 against Rs. 265-8-0 and Rs. 262-13-6 during the years 1930 and 1929, respectively. The manufactory continued to show a profit on the year's working. 8. It is hoped that the amendment to form 8 which was referred to in last year's review will have been made before the report for the year 1932 is due with Government. 9. Major C. J. Lodge Patch, M.C., I.M.S., was in charge of the hospital throughout the year, and the thanks of the Punjab Government (Ministry of Educa- tion) are due to him and to the staff of the hospital for a successful year's work. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, C. V. SALUSBURY, Secretary to Government, Punjab, Transferred Departments. 1756 CSNo. 2844-G. FROM LIEUT.-COLONEL D. P.
