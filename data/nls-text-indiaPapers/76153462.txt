ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BENGAL VETERINARY COLLEGE (including the Reports of the Epizootic Disease in Calcutta and its Vicinity and of the Research Laboratory) FOR THE YEAR 1909-1910. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. THE duties of my appointment were the same as last year, namely :( 2 ) 4. The following tabular statement shows the admissions, the variations in the number of students and the results of the examinations during the year:( 3 ) One thousand and fifteen operations were performed, against 1,745 of last year( 4 ) observation at the close of the last year. Of these, 90 were destroyed (86 for Glanders and 4 for Surra) and 8 died in the hospital; 315 were discharged, after mallein test, as free from the disease, and 7 remained under observation. I am extending the system of testing suspicious and in-contact cases by arrangement with the garriwallahs. There was no friction with owners of horses. 3. The system of paying compensation to poor people whose horses were destroyed under the Act and the payment of a small fee to persons who gave information of outbreaks of disease was continued during the year. In 23 cases, compensation amounting to Rs. 503 and in 6 cases, fees amounting to Rs. 8 were paid, making a total of Rs. 511. 4. While the Remount Depôt at Garden Reach was closed from April to October, 2,757 horses and 41 cattle were inspected by the Glanders Staff on boardship in the Port of Calcutta. No clinical symptoms of infectious disease were observed. 5. With the sanction of the Hon'ble Mr. Earle, Chairman of the Calcutta Corporation, I have taken over, as part of the duties of my staff which works under Act XIII of 1899, the management of outbreaks of infectious disease amongst the cattle of all kinds in Calcutta. Hitherto I have only dealt officially with equine disease. This extension which was foreshadowed in the anti-glanders scheme submitted in 1904 to Government also connotates the presentation, practically free of cost to the rate-payers, of the help of a veterinary adviser and a veterinary staff to the Corporation, if they choose to make use of them. A simple system of mutual intelligence has been arranged between the Health Officer and myself whereby we shall keep ourselves mutually informed of outbreaks which come to our notice. As cattle-owners and milkmen are no less subject to scares in Calcutta than in the mufassal, our work will have to progress gradually, in order to prevent panics; the first thing is to prove to cattle-owners that we are their friends and helpers. 6. Two thousand four hundred and forty-three head of cattle were inoculated against Rinderpest in Calcutta and suburbs by the Glanders Staff. The details of inoculations have been included in Table III of the Depart- mental Report. 7. Dourine.( 5 ) SECTION II. Rinderpest( 6 ) these, various morbid growths such as Carcinoma, Infective Sarcoma, different kinds of Entozoa, etc., were also the subjects of reports. SECTION VI.

[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] PREFACE AND GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. 1. During the year under report, I held charge of the Department as Superintendent, from the 1st of April to the 18th of August 1909, and from 22nd of December to the 31st of March 1910, being on leave home during the intermediate period. Colonel Raymond acted for me in addition to his own duties as Principal of the Bengal Veterinary College. I spent 141 days on tour, and travelled 1,030 miles by road, and 9,816 miles by rail. Although absent for a considerable period, during the year, most of the Dispensaries and Itinerating Assistants have been inspected. 2. During my tours, I was fortunate in being present at two severe outbreaks of anthrax in Palamau and Darjeeling Terai in May. In both cases microscopical and bacteriological examinations were carried out, and from materials supplied by me, the diagnosis was confirmed at the laboratory attached to the Bengal Veterinary College. I also attended the outbreaks of rinderpest in Darjeeling and of glanders at Burdwan, Hooghly and Kandi. The most important cattle fairs and shows were inspected, as well as the cattle breeding farms at Pusa, Siripur and Kalimpong. 3. The inspecting staff is still very low, as only five Inspectors were available for mufassal work. During the year, the province was divided into five circles, with an Inspector in charge of each. They have been made responsible for the efficiency of the dispensaries and Itinerating Assistants under them. This arrangement is working satisfactorily, but the districts are still too large to admit of really satisfactory inspection. 4. A sum of Rs. 10,000 was sanctioned by Government last year, as a contribution towards the cost of the introduction of the reorganisation scheme, but it was not brought into operation during the year. PART I.-VETERINARY INSTRUCTION. 5. The practice of sending Veterinary Assistants to Muktesar was dis- continued last year. All graduates now receive training in inoculation at the Bengal Veterinary College, before their diplomas are granted to them. Some Inspectors and Veterinary Assistants were sent to Belgachia, for a course of training in laboratory methods and general practice. This sys- tem will be extended each year, and should lead to most satisfactory results. PART. II-TREATMENT OF DISEASE. 6. Contagious diseases.( 2 ) have submitted returns of contagious diseases this year, but those sent in by Bankura, Hooghly, Howrah, Murshidabad, Darbhanga, Monghyr, Bhagalpur, Cuttack, Balasore, Angul and Puri appear to be under-estimated. The atten- tion of the authorities of the districts concerned have been drawn to the figures. 8. (a) Equines:( 3 ) 16. With reference tothe outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Puri last year, it was found that the total number of deaths was 406 instead of 2,311 reported by the police. The attention of the authorities was drawn to these errors and suitable action was taken. 17. An outbreak occurred among the Siripur Farm cattle during the year, but it was quickly suppressed by the Veterinary Assistant of Larpur Dispensary. 18. Hæmorrhagic Septiæmia.( 4 ) were found to have died after inoculation. Two thousand four hundred and forty-three animals were immunised against rinderpest by the Calcutta Glan- ders Department. There was thus an increase of 3,370 over that of the previous year. With the staff at my disposal it was hoped that the number of animals inoculated would have been still further augmented, but owing to the stoppage of the supply of serum from the laboratory at Muktesar during the months of September, October, November and December 1909, the returns are not as satisfactory as I had hoped they would have been. Regarding ino- culation against rinderpest in the hills, serum, unless administered in extremely large doses and at short intervals, has not been very effective. Protection by the " Simultaneous method" will be given a trial next cold weather and a report issued on the result. Reference has already been made to inoculation against Black Quarter. 26. In order to avoid in future the inconvenience which this year arose from the stoppage of the serum supply from Muktesar, the Inspector-General Civil Veterinary Department, has asked me to make enquiries regarding a site, and the number of cattle that are available for purchase in Darjeeling and its neighbourhood, for a laboratory which he intends to establish in that district, for the supply of serum and vaccines. An Inspector has been deputed to Sikkim, Darjeeling and Kalimpong for the purpose. Such a laboratory for this province and Eastern Bengal and Assam would be of the greatest benefit besides stimulating investigation into the various diseases which cause such a high mortality among horses, cattle and other domesticated animals. 27. Inoculation in some districts has failed again this year owing to the opposition of the ryots, especially in North Bhagalpur, 24-Parganas and Hooghly; in Burdwan and Sambalpur they also objected. I append for information a table showing the number anti-rinderpest inoculations performed in each district:( 5 ) improved by the addition of a dispensing room and office, while furniture and instruments have also been provided. The assistant's quarters were enlarged and made habitable. The Manager, Captain Rutherford, D.S.O., takes keen interest in the success of the hospital. 33. Palamau.( 6 ) cases last year, whereas this year, only new cases have been entered. The figures are 486 for 1909-10 and 5,330 for 1908-09. 45. Burdwan.( 7 ) SHOFING FORGES. 58. Eight shoeing forges were at work in the Province during the year, viz., at (1) Purnea, (2) Ranchi, (3) Gaya, (4) Sambalpur, (5) Bhagalpur, (6) Motihari, (7) Monghyr and (8) Cuttack. The following notes are extracted from the Committee's reports( 8 ) of new cases treated by the Veterinary Assistants and excludes old cases, cases for which advice was given but no medicine, and inoculations, and they are as correct as it is at present possible to make them. As the inspecting staff increases and more attention can be paid to the work of each assistant, they will become of greater value in judging the work which these men now per- form in the districts. 60. The Veterinary Assistants of the following districts did not work satisfactorily:( 9 ) 70. I append for information a statement showing the number of cows maintained since 1906 and the calves born together with the percentage of male to female and the number of rejections and the percentage:( 10 ) 80. If it is not subjected to floods during the rains it will be very suitable for the purpose, as there is such a large grazing area. Part of the high land has been already broken up and is being made ready for forage crops. 81. A large portion of the grass jungle has also been burnt and the area so cleared is now much freer from ticks, from the attacks of which the cattle suffered severely when first placed there. The extension of cultivation will, I hope, eradicate them within a few years. Arrangements have been made for the feeding of the cattle, but these are not yet satisfactory; grass sheds have also been erected, 82. The herd of 45 cows is inadequate for such a large estate as Bettiah and should be increased to at least 150; a herd of this size will require special supervision which should be in the hands of a European Superintendent acquainted with the conditions prevailing in Bihar. With the Siripur Farm as a model there does not appear to be any reason why the Bettiah Farm should not succeed if it is placed in charge of a person who can devote the greater part of his time to the work. 83. During the coming cold weather it is hoped that a number of Delhi buffalo bull calves will be purchased for the purpose of improving the local breed of buffalos on the estate. 84. Kalimpong.( 11 ) Babu J. L. Bose of Angul secured the first prize and Babu S. N. Chatterjee of Bhagalpur the second. Owing to the severe illness of the Second Imperial Entomologist, Mr. F. M. Howlett, no report on the specimens can be submitted till his return from leave next November. The total number of collections sent to Pusa for identification was 45. SPECIMENS. 89. Particular attention has been paid to the submission of blood-slides and post-mortem specimens by Veterinary Assistants to the Raymond Laboratory for diagnostic purposes. Altogether on 113 occasions slides were sent by 29 Veterinary Assistants with the result that the following diseases were diagnosed :( 12 ) He attended 13 outbreaks of Rinderpest, 3 of Foot-and-Mouth disease. 2 of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and two of Glanders.

The increase in the number of deaths recorded is due more to these inspections than to any actual increase in the number of outbreaks over that of previous years; but in many districts there is still a tendency to underestimate. Outside Calcutta and the suburbs 12,549 cattle were protected against rinder- pest by serum inoculation as compared with 11,659 in the previous year. Of these, only 93 animals died after inoculation. The number of inoculations would have been larger if the work had not been interrupted by the stoppage of the supply of serum from Mukteswar between September and December 1909. The question of arranging for a more convenient source of supply of serum is under consideration. 9.
