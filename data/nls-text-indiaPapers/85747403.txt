The Sanitary Commissioner has recently recommended that action should be taken by all heads of departments to ensure that Government employees subordinate to them are properly protected against small-pox. In the recent epidemic many cases of unvaccinated policemen were admitted to the Lahore Small-pox Hospital, and on the matter being brought to his notice, the Inspector-General of Police found it possible to initiate suitable measures for the popularization of vaccination among the rank and file of the police. Similar measures might well be taken in other Government departments and Sir Edward Maclagan is drawing the attention of all heads of departments to the matter.

FORSTER, D.P.H., I.M S., Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, To THE HON'BLE MR. B. T. GIBSON, I.C.S., Financial Secretary to Government, Punjab. Dated Lahore, the 9th July 1919. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward. for the information of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, the Annual Vaccination Statements for the year 1918-19. Administration. 2. The charge of the Vaccination Department was held by the Hon'ble Colonel (now Major-General) H. Hendley, M.D, K.H.S., I.M S., in addition to that of Inspector General of Civil Hospitals till the 16th August 1918 when I relieved him and held charge for the remainder of the year. I held charge of the post of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner until I was relieved by Major H. M. Mackenzie, himself a former Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, on 16th August 1918, who remained in charge for the rest of the year. The appointment of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner was held both by Major Mackenzie and myself in addition to that of Professor of Pathology at the Lahore Medical College. Dr. K. A. Rahman, M.B., Ch.B. (Edin.), D P.H. (London), held the post of Additional Deputy Sanitary Commissioner during the year. The appointment of Superintendent, Punjab Vaccine Institute, was held by Assistant Surgeon Prem Nath, Suri, from the commence- ment of the year till 12th February 1919, when he was relieved by Military Assistant Surgeon H. C. Phillips who held the post till the end of the year. Strength of vacci- nation establishment Statement No. 11. 3. The number of Divisional Inspectors (5) and the Superintendents of Vaccination (30) remained unaltered during the year, but the number of vaccinators employed increased from 285 to 298. The increase is due to the entertainment of extra vaccinators for short periods in the districts of Gurgaon, Simla, Kangra, Hoshiarpur, Ludhiana, Lahore, Gurdaspur, Gujranwala, Jhelum, Rawalpindi, Mianwali, Montgomery, Lyallpur and Muzaffargarh to combat the epidemic of small-pox which prevailed during the year. Cost of the De- partment. Statement No. II. 4. The cost of the Department amounted to Rs. 141,816 showing an increase of Rs. 11,225 as compared with Rs. 1,30,591 for the previous year. The increase was chiefly due to grade promotion in the Vaccination staff and contingencies. Cost of each suc- cessful case. Statement No. II. 5. The average cost of each successful vaccination was Re. 0-2-10 as compared with Re. 0-3-0 in the previous year. The decrease in the cost per successful vaccination is due to the increase in the number of operations performed during the year. If, however, the sum of Rs. 37,356 which has been credited to Government on account of cost of vaccine sold be deducted from the total expenditure the average cost works out Re. 0-2-1 as compared with Re. 0-2-5 in the previous year. Total operations done by all establish- ments. Statement No. I. 6. The total number of operations reported to have been performed by all establishments during the year under report was 994,593 showing an increase of 190,364. Of the total cases 566,062 were recorded as primary vaccinations and 428,531 as re-vaccinations against 621,650 and 182,579 in 1917-18. The decrease in primary vaccination is generally attributed to the prevalence of Influenza whilst the great increase in the number of re-vac- cinations is the result of a general vaccination campagin against the epidemic- of small-pox which prevailed throughout the season.
2 House to house vaccination. 7. There was a total of 37,814 operations performed under the house to house system in 8 districts, viz., Hissar (1,837), Simla (1,049), Ferozepore (1,922), Lahore 27,500, Shahpur (2,089), Jhelum (51), Montgomery (1,052), and Jhang (2,314). The Civil Surgeon, Gujrat, reports that house to house vaccin- ation was not carried out by the staff as it was essential that the work should be done as expeditiously as possible and this measure was not specially called for by the people, while the Deputy Commissioner, Karnal, thinks the system a waste of time. House to house vaccination, however, is of great value in face of an epidemic, and to my personal knowledge it was resorted to freely both in Lahore and Amritsar during the epidemic with valuable results. District staff. Statement No. I. 8. The total number of operations performed by the District staff was 902,370 as against 738,797 in the previous year showing an increase of 163,573. There was a decrease of 42,123 in primary and an increase of 205,696 in re-vaccination. The diminution in primary vaccination is the result of the Influenza epidemic which was indirectly responsible for a very high infantile mortality and delayed the commencement of vaccination operations until the end of November. The increase in re-vaccination is the measure of the success of the campaign against the epidemic of small-pox. The measures employed to combat this epidemic were detailed in the Annual Sanitary Report and need not be repeated here. In the case of primary vaccination 9 districts record an increase and 19 a decrease. The decrease is most marked in the case of Gurgaon (11,116), Hissar (9,229) and Rohtak (6,998). These were, incidently, the districts which suffered most from the Influenza epidemic. In the case of re-vaccination 5 districts record a decrease and 23 an increase. The increase is most marked in the case of Kangra (31,852) and Lahore (21,542). These districts were rather severely affected by the small-pox epidemic. The percentage of males and females to total number of re-vaccinations was 70.25 in the case of males and 29.74 in that of females as against 65.95 and 34.05 in the preceding year. The percentage of success in primary vacci- nation was 98.66 as against 98.25 in the previous year, while in the case of re-vaccination it was 79.39 as compared with 77.16. This satisfactory result may be attributed partly to the excellent quality of the lymph supplied and partly to the fact that most of the vaccinators have now been trained in the Punjab Vaccine Institute.The percentage of vaccinations in which results were not known to the total number in 1918-19 was 4.53 in the case of primary and 17.82 in that of re-vaccination as compared with 4.80 and 18.71, res- pectvely, in the year preceding. Ratio of persons successfully vaccinat- ed per 1,000 of popu- lation. Statement No. I. Special staff. Statement No. I and its Appendix. 9. The ratio of persons successfully vaccinated by the District staff was 38.37 per mille of population as against 33.09 in the previous year. 10. The vaccinators of the Special staff, Punjab, performed 19,490 primary operations and 33,633 re-vaccinations as compared with 38,201 and 15,032 in the year 1917-18. The percentage of success was 97.92 in the case of primary operations and 83.98 in that of re-vaccination as against 97.34 and 73.66, respectively, in the previous year. Cantonment staff Statement No. I and its Appendix. 11. The work done in those cantonments which entertain their own vaccinators amounted to 3,261 primary vaccinations and 14,366 re-vaccinations, a decrease of 704 in the case of the former and an increase of 7,585 in the latter over the corresponding figures for last year. The largest number of persons vaccinated was 6,809 in Lahore, 3.533 in Ambala and 2,828 in Rawalpindi. The percentage of success was 98.57 in primary and 77.79 in re-vaccination as against 98.79 and 79.31 in the previous year, and the ratio per cent. of unknown cases to total cases in the case of primary was 3.56 and re-vaccination 9.71 as compared with 3.78 and 3.61. Dispensary staff Statement No III. 12. It is gratifying to note that during the year under report in 14 districts vaccination was performed at dispensaries the totals being 7,230 primary and 14,243 in re-vaccinations as against 1,280 and 173 in the previous year. The percentage of success was 98.77 in primary and 83.21 in re-vacci- nation as compared with 99.43 and 76.16 in the year preceding. The largest
3 number of operations 5,960 was performed at dispensaries in the Gurdaspur District, Jullundur coming next with 4,935 and Hoshiarpur third with 4,471. Inspection work Statemeat No. V. 13. During the year the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner visited 88 towns and villages and inspected the results of 573 primary and 251 re-vacci- nations. He found a percentage of success of 98.60 in primary and 74.10 in re- vaccination. The Additional Deputy Sanitary Commissioner inspected vaccination in the towns of Shahabad, Panipat, Ballabgarh, Palwal, Jagraon and Kartarpur. The number of primary vaccinations inspected was 505 giving a success rate of 97.03 per cent. On account of the prevalence of small-pox in most of the towns in the Province he was unable to inspect vaccination in rural areas. He visited the towns of Multan, Gujranwala, Muktsar, Ferozepore, Ludhiana, Jullundur, Hoshiarpur, Amritsar, Batala, Kasur, Gujrat, Sialkot, Hodal and Sohna in connection with the outbreak of small-pox. Civil Surgeons and Health Officers made 43.808 inspections of primary vaccination and 21,647 of re-vaccination, Divisional Inspectors 83,423 and 15,535 and Superintendents of Vaccination 355,583 and 202,919 respectively. The percentage of success verified by Civil Surgeons and Health Officers was 97.94 in primary and 72.97 in re-vaccination as compared with 96.76 and 61.26 and 97.46 and 77.42 found by Divisional Inspectors and Superintendents, respectively. The rates of success reported by vaccinators were 98.64 in primary and 79.72 in re-vaccina tion as against 98.19 and 76.95 in the year preceding. Vaccination in large Native States. 14. The number of primary vaccinations and re-vaccinations performed in 1918-19 in those Native States which entertain their own vaccinators was as follows:4 The total number of one-gram tubes issued was 61,731 as compared with 49,087 in the previous year as detailed below:A.ii A.iii DEPARTMENT.

FRENCH, C.I.E., C.B.E., I.C.S., Offg. Financial Secretary to Government, Punjab Dated Lahore, the 13th July 1920. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward, for the information of His Honour the Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab, the Annual Vaccination Returns for the year 1919-20. The previous reports for 1917-18 and 1918-19 briefly noticed the more important points in the vaccination returns while the present report deals more fully with the vaccination work performed during the triennium ending 31st March 1920. Administration. 2. I was in charge of the Department throughout the year. The offices of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner and Additional Deputy Sani- tary Commissioner were held by Lieutenant-Colonel H. M. Mackenzie, I.M.S., and K. S. Dr. K. A. Rahman, D.P.H., respectively, throughout the year. The post of Superintendent, Punjab Vaccine Institute, was held by Military Assistant Surgeon H. C. Phillips, I.M.D. Strength of vacci- nation establish- ment. Statement No. II. 3. The number of Divisional Inspectors (5) remained the same as in the last 2 years and the following table shows the number of Superintendents of Vaccination and Vaccinators employed in the province during the last triennium:2 crease was due as usual to grade promotion in the vaccination staff, travelling allowances and contingencies in consequence of the deputation of vaccinators to combat epidemic diseases other than small-pox and to attend classes for training at the Punjab Vaccine Institute, Lahore ; enter- tainment of extra vaccinators, grain compensation, war and temporary allowances. The total cost of the department for the triennium under review was Rs. 4,35,589 as compared with Rs. 4,31,084 in the preceding triennial period. Cost of each suc- cessful case. Statement No. II. 5. The cost per successful operation was Re. 0-3-5 against Re. 0-2-10 and Re. 0-3-0 in the years 1918-19 and 1917-18, respectively. The increase in the cost is due to the reasons given in the preceding paragraph. The average cost of each successful case, viz., Re. 0-3-1 during the triennial period under report remained nearly the same as in the preceding period. If the sum of Rs. 38,058 which has been received and credited to Government on account of cost of vaccine sold be deducted from the total cost the average cost works out Re. 0-2-7 for the year 1919-20 as compared with Re. 0-2-1 and Re. 0-2-5 in the years 1918-19 and 1917-18, respectively. On this basis the average cost in the triennium is Re. 0-2-4. Total operations done by all establish- ments. Statement No. I. 6. The total number of operations performed by all establishments during the year amounted to 928,822 showing a decrease of 65,771 compared with the previous year. The total operations during the triennium under review numbered 2,727,644 as against 2,600,325 in the previous triennium, the annual averages being 909,215 and 866,775, respectively. Primary vaccina- tions numbered 1,792,855 or 252,980 less than in the preceding triennium, while revaccinations numbered 934,789 showing an increase of 380,299. The de- crease in primary vaccination in 1917-18 and 1918-19 as already reported was due to fewer infants being available for vaccination in consequence of the high in- fantile mortality that occurred during the wide spread epidemic of malaria in the autumn of 1917 and to the prevalence of influenza in 1918. During the year under report there was an increase in primary vacciation and a decrease in re-vaccination as compared with the figures for the previous year. The increase in primary vaccination is due to the employment of extra vaccinators in some districts and to the special efforts made to prevent the spread of small-pox in accordance with the instructions issued by me to all Civil Sur- geons and Health Officers in the Punjab. In explanation of the decrease in re-vaccination it is generally put for- ward that last year almost all school children were revaccinated. There can be little doubt however that the deficit is in no small measure due to lack of sustained effort. The Medical Department is notoriously overworked at present and the systematic appointment of District Health Officers responsi- ble for vaccination operations will relieve the situation. House to house vaccination. 7. A total of 25,636 operations was attained during 1919-20 under the house to house system in 9 districts, viz., Hissar (3,596), Karnal (6,115), Simla, Municipality (2,147), Ferozepore (2,137), Lahore Municipality (6,000), Shahpur (2,197), Montgomery (608), Jhang (2,120) and Muzaffargarh (716). In the Gujranwala District house to house vaccination was performed in the towns of Gujranwala and Akalgarh. District Staff. Statement No, I. 8. In the triennial period under report the number of operations performed by the district staff amounted to 2,504,157 as against 2,420,746 during the previous triennium. Of the total number of operations 1,688,642 were primary and 815,515 re-vaccinations, showing a decrease of 250,501 in the former and an increase of 333,912 in the latter as compared with the triennial period 19143 which have been given in paragraph 6 of the report. In 21 districts an excess was recorded in primary vaccination, being most marked in Multan where it amounted to 7,344. Next to Multan come Kangra with an excess of 4,878, Jhang with an excess of 4,791 and Lyallpur with an excess of 4,686. On the other hand there was a decrease in 7 districts, those in which it was marked being Gurdaspur (7,118), Sialkot (4,610) and Lahore (2,278). In regard to re-vaccination there was an increase in 13 districts and a decrease in 15 districts. The decrease was most marked in Amritsar (19,359), Lahore (16,654), Kangra (7,456), and Gujranwala (7,241). Total number of persons vaccinated by District staff. Satement No. I. 9. The number of persons vaccinated by the district staff in the triennium under report was 2,501,079 as against 2,404,903 in the preceding period showing an increase of 96,171. Percentage of suc- cessful operations by all establishments. 10.

MACKENZIE, D.P.H., I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Punjab, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, PUNJAB, TRANSFERRED DEPARTMENTS. Dated Lahore, 29th June 1921. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward, for the information of Government, the Annual Vaccination Statements for the year 1920-21. Establishment. 2, The charge of the Vaccination Department was held by Lieutenant- Colonel W. H. C. Forster, D.P.H., I.M.S., till the 24th February when I relieved him and held charge for the remainder of the year. The charge of the post of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner was held by me until the 24th February in addition to that of the chair of Pathology, King Edward Medical College, Lahore, and Bacteriologist to Government, Punjab. On February 25th I was relieved by Doctor K. A. Rahman, M.B., Ch.B., (Edin,), D.P.H. (London), who remained in charge up to 8th March, the date on which Major H. Falk, I.M.S., took over and held the appointment for the rest of the year. The office of the Additional Deputy Sanitary Commissioner was throughout the year held by Khan Sahib Doctor K. A. Rahman, who in addition held the post of Chief Plague Medical Officer from 1st June and that of Chief Malaria Medical Officer as a further additional charge from 21st July. The appointment of Superintendent, Punjab Vaccine Institute, was held by Military Assistant Surgeon H. C. Phillips throughout the year. Strength of Vaccina- tion establishment. Statement No. II. 3. The number of Divisional Inspectors remained the same as last year, viz., 5, and the number of Superintendents of Vaccination (32) including 2 Superintendents belonging to the Special Vaccination Staff (Provin- cial) remained unaltered during the year but the number of vaccinators employ- ed by the local bodies in the province decreased from 295 to 285. This decrease is due to the reduction in the number of temporary vaccinators who were entertained to deal with the outbreak of small-pox which was prevalent last year in the districts of Hissar, Amritsar, Gujrat, Shahpur, Jhelum and Mont- gomery and whose services were dispensed with when no longer required. The number of vaccinators of the Special Staff (16) remained the same as last year. In paragraph 23 of the Annual Sanitary Report, Punjab, for 1919, it was suggested that among other measures for successfully dealing with Small- pox the District Vaccination Staff should be increased to a minimum of two vaccinators per tahsil, and from the action taken in this direction it is gratify- ing to note that in many districts the staff has been brought up to the standard recommended, Cost of the Depart- ment. Statement No. II. 4. The cost of the Department as detailed in Statement No. II appended to the report amounted to Rs. 2,09,402, an increase of Rs. 46,220 as compared with Rs. 1,63,182 for the previous year. The increase in the expenditure is due partly to general revision of the pay of establishment and partly to the sale price of vaccine which during the year was raised from annas twelve per tube to rupee one per tube.
2 Cost of each success- ful case. Statement No. II. 5. The average cost of each successful vaccination was Re. 0-4-5 as compared with Re. 0-3-5 in the previous year. The increase in the cost per successful vaccination is due to the reasons stated in the preceding paragraph. If, however, the sum of Rs. 40,300 which has been credited to Government on account of cost of vaccine sold be deducted from the total expenditure the average cost works out to Re. 0-3-7 as against Re. 0-2-7 in the previous year. Total operations done by all establishments. Statement No. II. 6 The total number of operations reported to have been performed by all establishments during the year under report was 916,000 showing a decrease of 12,822 as compared with the figures (928,822) for the previous year. Of the total cases 650,938 were recorded as primary vaccinations and 265,062 as re-vaccinations against 605,143 and 323,679 in 1919-20. The decrease in re-vaccinations is generally attributed partly to the prevalence of small-pox in a less virulent form during the year and partly in some districts to the non-co-operation movement. House to house Vacci- nation. 7. There was a total of 17,557 operations performed under the house to house system in 8 districts, viz., Hissar (2,312), Karnal (1,585), Simla Muni- cipality (53), Ferozepore (2,182), Lahore (9,027), Shahpur (782), Montgomery (810) and Muzaffargarh (803). In the Gujranwala District, house to house vaccination was performed in the towns of Akalgarh, Ramnagar, Hafizabad and Kila Didar Singh. In many districts this form of performing operations was resented by the people. As has already been pointed out previously house to house vaccination is of great value in face of an epidemic and it is hoped that in time the prejudice against it will cease to exist and that before long it will rather be the rule than the exception. District Staff. Statement No. I. 8. The total number of operations performed by the District Staff was 864,464 as against 862,990 in the previous year showing an increase of 1,474. There was an increase of 47,459 in primary and a decrease of 45,985 in re-vacci- nations. The diminution in re-vaccination is due to the reasons stated in paragraph 6 of this report. The decrease in the number of re-vaccinations -in the Rohtak and Jullundur Districts is attributed to the attitude of the people who, imbued with ideas of non-co-operation, refused to present older children for operation thus totally disregarding the advice that the measure was essential in securing to them immunity against small-pox. In the Jhelum and Mianwali Districts the decrease in the number of re vaccinations is chiefly due to most of the people having emigrated to irrigated tracts owing to drought. In the case of primary vaccinations the number of districts which recorded an increase was 20 and those recording a decrease 8. The decrease is most marked in the districts of Ambala (1,733), Karnal (1,589) and Hoshiar- pur (1,009). In the Ambala and Karnal districts it was due to the low birth rate during the year while in the Hoshiarpur District the decrease was attribu- table to the ignorance of the people who do not attach much importance to vaccination. In the case of re-vaccination, 9 districts recorded an increase and 19 a decrease. The increase is most marked in the districts of Gujranwala (12,226), Rawalpindi (6,005), Ambala (2,822) and Multan (2,579). The percentage of males and females to total number of re-vaccinations was 66.61 in the case of males and 33.30 in that of females as against 68.62 and 31.38 in the preceding year. The percentage of success in primary vaccination was 96.50 as against 90.98 in the previous year, while in the case of re-vaccina- tion it was 78.24 as compared with 76.10. The percentage of vaccinations in which results were not known to the total number in 1920-21 was 5.02 in the case of primary and 16.90 in that of re-vaccination as compared with 4.69 and 17.15, respectively, in the preceding year. Ratio of persons successfully vaccina- ted per 1,000 of po- pulation Statement No. I. 9. The ratio of persons successfully vaccinated by the District Staff was 37.09 per mille of population as against 37.05 in the previous year. Special Staff. Statement No. I and its Appendix. 10. The vaccinators of the Special Staff, Punjab, performed 23,628 primary operations and 20,032 re-vaccinations as compared with 25,305 and 29,161 in the previous year. The percentage of success was 93.13 in the case of primary operations and 65.08 in that of re-vaccination as against 97.31 and 77.36, respectively, in the preceding year.
3 Cantonment Staff, Statement No. I and its Appendix. 11. The work done in those cantonments which entertain their own vaccinators amounted to 4,068 primary vaccinations and 1,454 re-vaccinations, an increase of 524 in the case of the former and a decrease of 2,587 in the latter over the corresponding figures for last year. The largest number of persons vaccinated was 2,037 in Ambala and 1,030 in Lahore Can- tonment. The percentage of success was 98.93 in primary and 70.73 in re-vaccinations as against 97.91 and 69.03 in the previous year and the ratio per cent of unknown cases to total cases in the case of primary was 1.50 and re-vaccination 10.94 as compared with 1.38 and 9.38. Dispensary Staff Statement No. III. 12. During the year under report vaccination was performed at dis- pensaries in 7 out of the 29 districts, the total being 14.26 primary and 928 re-vaccinations as against 19.37 and 18.44 in the previous year. The percentage of success was 98.93 in primary and 85.85 in re-vaccination as compared with 98.53 and 88.02 in the preceding year. The largest number of operations 14.05 was performed at dispen- saries in the Ferozepore District, Attock coming next with 483. Inspection work Statement No. V. 13. Lieutenant-Colonel W. H. C., Forster, D.P.H., I.M.S., my pre- decessor, inspected 150 primary and 50 re-vaccinations and the result was good. During the year the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner visited 88 towns and villages and inspected the result of 786 primary and 235 re-vaccinations. He found a percentage of success of 95.17 in primary and 55.32 in re- vaccinations. The Additional Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, owing to his other duties of Chief Plague Medical Officer and Chief Malaria Medical Officer as also those of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner for a short period, had no time to inspect vaccinations during the winter months. Civil Surgeons and Medical Officers of Health made 57,372 inspections of primary vaccination and 13,648 of re-vaccination, Divisional Inspectors 113,654 and 30,382 and Superintendents of Vaccination 421,459 and 144,115, respectively. The percentage of success verified by Civil Surgeons and Medical Officers of Health was 94.06 in primary and 72.42 in re-vaccination, as com- pared with 93.13 and 72.19 and 94.91 and 67.16 found by Divisional Inspectors and Superintendents, respectively. The rates of success reported by vaccinators were 96.40 in primary and 72.60 in re-vacci- nation as against 97.95 and 76.10 in the preceding year. Vaccination in large Native States. 14. The vaccination operations performed in the large Native States which employ their own vaccinators were as follows :4 In the Lahore Municipality no less than 10,500 notices were issued to those who failed to have their children vaccinated. Only 49 cases were sent to court and out of these 18 were vaccinated by the order of the court and the cases of 31 are still pending. In the Rawalpindi Municipality 8 persons were challaned in the courts under the Compulsory Vaccination Act but no fines were inflicted. It has been reported that in the towns of Bhera, Miani, Khushab and Sargodha, the Vaccination Act though in force is not rigidly enforced. Inoculation. 16. No small-pox inpoulation was reported to have been performed in any part of the province during the year. Diagram, 17.

FROM LIEUT.-COLONEL W. H. C. FORSTER, D.P.H., I.M.S., Director of Public Health, Punjab, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, PUNJAB, TRANSFERRED DEPARTMENTS. Dated Lahore, the 28th June 1922. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward, for the information of the Punjab Government (Ministry of Education), the Annual Vaccination Statements for the year 1921-22. Establishment. 2. During my absence on leave the charge of the Vaccination Depart- ment was held by Lieut.-Colonel H. M. Mackenzie, I.M.S., from 1st April to 20th October, on which date he handed over charge to Bt. Lieut.- Colonel C. A. Gill, I.M S., and proceeded on leave out of India. Colonel Gill continued his control over the Department till 19th December, on which date I resumed charge of the Department on return from leave and held it till the end of the year. During the year under report the use of the term &quot;Additional&quot; before Deputy Sanitary Commissioner was abandoned and a re-arrangement of the duties of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners was made at the beginning of the year whereby the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner in- charge of the Jullundur, Ambala and Multan Divisions was designated as Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Southern Range, and the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner in-charge of the Lahore and Rawalpindi Divisions and the Punjab Vaccine Institute as Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Northern Range. Dr. K. A. Rahman, M.B., Ch.B., D.P.H., remained in-charge of the Southern Range and Major H. Falk, I.M.S., held charge of the Northern Range throughout the year. The appointment of Superintendent, Punjab Vaccine Institute, was held by Military Assistant Surgeon H. C. Phillips from 1st April to 6th September, and by Military Assistant Surgeon W. B. Hallum from 7th Sep- tember to 6th October on which date Military Assistant Surgeon Phillips resumed charge on return from leave and held it till the end of year. Strength of Vacci- nation establish- ment. Statement No. II. 3. The number of Divisional Inspectors remained the same as last year, viz., 5 upto 15th January 1922, on which date the Divisional Inspector of the Multan Division was retired and no recruitment was made in his place, as at the end of the year it was decided to finally abolish these posts of Divi- sional Inspectors. The number of Superintendents of Vaccination (32) includ- ing 2 Superintendents of Vaccination belonging to the Special-Vaccination Staff (Provincial) remained unaltered, but the cadre of vaccinators employed by the local bodies was strengthened by the addition of 11 vaccinators during the year. This increase in the number of vaccinators is due to the recommenda- tion made by me that with a view to successfully dealing with outbreaks of small-pox there should be a minimum of two vaccinators per tahsil instead of one, as was the case formerly. The number of vaccinators of the Special Staff was increased from 16 to 22 during the year under report, chiefly for the purpose of assisting local bodies and others in combating the spread of epidemic diseases in the province. It is reported that no vaccination work was done at Jalalpur Jattan in the Gujrat District till the 26th December 1921 when the municipality sanctioned an allowance of Rs. 5 per mensem for the local compounder. This
2 is against rules, as not possessing the necessary training a compounder cannot be expected to do the work efficiently, and the Assistant Director of Public Health, Northern Range, has been requested to take up the matter with the local body concerned. Similarly in the Karor, Leiah and Alipur municipalities vaccination work was entrusted to the local Octroi Muharrirs and the attention of the local bodies concerned has been drawn to the rules on the subject. Cost of the De- partment. Statement No. II. 4. The total cost of the Department (including cost of the Vaccine Institute) as detailed in statement No. II appended to the report amounted to Rs. 2,66,881 showing an increase of Rs. 57,479 when compared with the figures for the last year. The increase in the expenditure is due chiefly to the in- creased rates of pay of the establishments sanctioned by local bodies and to the enhanced rates of travelling allowance : also to some extent to the cost of furniture, typewriters, etc., for the office of the District Medical Officer of Health, Gurgaon. Of the total cost of Rs. 2,66,881, the sum contributed by Provincial funds amounted to Rs. 96,836, by local funds Rs. 1,41,919, by municipal funds Rs. 24,482, and by Cantonment funds Rs. 3,642. Cost of each suc- cessful case. Statement No II. 5. The total number of successful vaccinations and re-vaccinations amounted to 718,418. The cost of each successful operation works out to Re. 0-5-11 against Re. 0-4-5, the cost for last year. The increase in the cost per successful vaccination is due to the reasons stated in the preceding paragraph. If, however, the sum of Rs. 46,526-8-3, which has been credited to Government on account of cost of vaccine sold, be deducted from the total expenditure, the average cost comes to Re. 0-4-11 as against Re. 0-3-7 in the previous year. Total operations done by all establish- ments. Statement No I. 6. The total number of operations reported to have been performed by all establishments during the year under report amounted to 852,824, showing a decrease of 63,176 as compared with the figures (916,000) for the previous year. Of the total cases 625,079 were recorded as primary vaccina- tions and 227,715 as re-vaccinations, against 650 938 and 265,062, respectively, in 1920-21. The decrease in both vaccination and re-vaccination during the year is attributed to a number of causes, chief of these being (1) the excessive infantile mortality, (2) the non-co operation movement, and (3) the indifferent and unsympathetic attitude of the people towards vaccination. House-to-house vaccination. 7. A total of 17,090 operations were performed under the vaccination house-to-house system during the year under report, the districts contributing this figure being Lahore (10,104), Ferozepore (2,284), Karnal (1,541) Muzaffar- garh (1,513), Shahpur (722), Montgomery (702) and Simla municipality (224). In four villages of the Jhajjar and Gohana Tahsils of the Rohtak District this system was successfully attempted during an epidemic of small-pox, and, though in a few districts it was resented by the people, this attitude on their part would seem to be due not so much to the system itself as to the manner in which the staff proceeded to carry it out. In one district the vaccinator instead of going from house to house expected the people to come to him with their children to a central place or village thus defeating the object for which it was advocated. District Staff. Statement No. I. 8. The total number of operations performed by the District Staff was 778,194 as against 864,464 in the previous year, showing a decrease of 86,270. There was a decrease of 23,854 in primary and of 62,416 in re-vaccination when compared with the figures for the preceding year. The reasons for the diminution in both primary and re-vaccination are stated in paragraph 6 of this report. In the case of primary vaccination 11 districts record an increase and 18 a decrease. The decrease is most marked in the districts of Hissar (5,727), Shahpur (3,459), Sialkot (3,216), Montgomery (2,957), Kangra (2,705), Rawal- pindi (2,548), and Mianwali (2,217). In the case of re-vaccination 10 districts record an increase, 19 a decrease. The districts in which the decrease is most marked are Karnal (15,206), Ambala (10,755) and Gurdaspur (10,035).
3 Those of the districts in which it was noticed that the number of pri- mary vaccinations performed during the month of November 1921, showed a con- siderable falling off in comparison with the figures for the corresponding month of the previous year were requested to make up the deficiency by the employ- ment of vaccinators of the Special Staff, and as a result of this action two such vaccinators each were detailed for duty in the Rohtak and Ferozepore Districts. The precentage to total number of re-vaccinations was 66.83 in the case of males and 33.17 in that of females as against 66.61 and 33.39 in the preceding year. The percentage of success in primary vaccination was 97.68 as against 96.50 in the previous year, while in the case of re-vaccination it was 74.86 as compared with 73.24. The precentage of vaccination in which results were not known to the total number in 1921-22 was 5.20 in the case of primary, and 17.13 in that of re-vaccination, as compared with 5.02 and 16.90, respectively, in the preceding year. Ratio of persons suc- cessfully vaccinated per 1,000 of popula- tion . Statement No. 1. 9. The ratio of persons successfully vaccinated by the District Staff was 32.42 per mille of population as against 37.09 in the previous year. Among the districts showing the best protection Jhang stood first with a ratio of 51.51 and was followed by Mianwali with 48.10. Then in order came Multan with 44.04, Muzaffargarh with 43.43, and Gujranwala with 41.47. Among the least protected districts the most conspicuous were Ambala (20.05) and Jhelum (21.10). Special Staff. Staff Statement No. I and its Appendix. 10. The number of primary operations and re-vaccinations performed by the vaccinators of the Special Staff, Punjab, during the year amounted to 21,834 and 46,421, respectively, as against 23,628 and 20,032 in the previous year. The percentage of success was 93.42 in the case of primary operations and 77.07 in that of re-vaccination, as against 93.13 and 65.08, respectively, in the preceding year. Cantonment Staff. Statement No. I and its Appendix. 11. In 1921-22, 4,827 vaccinations (4.119 primary and 708 re-vaccina- tion) were performed in those cantonments which entertain their own vaccina- tors against 5,522 (4.068 primary and 1,454 re-vaccination), in the preceding year. The largest number of persons vaccinated was 2,216 in Ambala, 799 in Ferozepore, 683 in Rawalpindi, and 602 in Lahore cantonments. The percent- age of success was 98.46 in primary and 76.58 in re-vaccinations, as against 98.93 and 70.73 in the previous year, and the ratio per cent. of unknown cases to total cases in the case of primary was 1.97 and re-vaccination 8.33, as compared with 1.50 and 10.94 in the preceding year. Dispensary Staff. Statement No. III. 12. During the year under report in 7 out of the 29 districts, 1,548 vaccination operations were performed by Medical subordinates at dispensaries; of these 1,164 were primary and 384 re-vaccinations, the figures for last year being 2,354, or 1,426 primary and 928 re-vaccinations. The percentage of success was 99.63 in primary and 83.80 in re-vaccination as compared with 98.93 and 85.85 in the preceding year The largest number of operations was performed at the dispensaries in the Ferozepore District amounting to 1,393. Inspection work. Statement No. V. 13. During the year the Assistant Director of Public Health, Northern Range, visited 36 towns and villages and inspected the results of 859 primary and 312 re-vaccinations. He found a percentage of success of 88.36 in pri- mary and 56.09 in re-vaccination. The Assistant Director of Public Health, Southern Range, was busy throughout the year in connection with the out- breaks of other epidemic diseases and consequently had very little time at his disposal to devote to inspection work. Civil Surgeons and Medical Officers of Health made 57,283 inspections of primary vaccination and 11,270 of re-vaccination, Divisional Inspectors 106,340 and 22,585 and Superintendents of Vaccination 401,988 and 138,748, respectively. The percentage of success verified by Civil Surgeons and Medical Officers of Health was 95.64 in primary and 62.65 in re-vaccination as compared with 93.72 and 58.21, and 70.58 and 74.45 found by Divisional Inspectors and Superintendents, respectively. The rates of success reported by vaccinators were 97.55 in primary and 75.33 in re-vaccination as against 96.40 and 72.60 in the preceding year.

SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward, for the information of the Punjab Government (Ministry of Education), the Annual Vaccination Returns for the year 1922-23. The intertriennial reports briefly noticed the more important points in the Vaccination Returns for the year 1920-21 and 1921-22, while the present report deals more fully with the vaccination work performed during the triennium ending 31st March 1923. Administration 2. From January 1st 1922 the designation of the Department was changed from the Sanitary to the Public Health Department, that of the Sanitary Commissioner to the Director of Public Health and that of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners to Assistant Directors of Public Health. I held charge of the Department throughout the year. The post of Assistant Director of Public Health, Northern Range, was held by Major H. Falk, D.P.H., I.M.S., for the first 3 days of the year, i.e., from 1st to 3rd April, when he proceeded on long leave out of India He was reliev- ed by Lt.-Col. C. A. Gill, D.P.H., I.M.S., who held charge of the post from 9th April 1922 to 19th January 1923 in addition to his own duties as Chief Malaria Medical Officer. Dr. K. A. Rahman relieved Lt.-Col. Gill of the additional charge on the afternoon of 19th January 1923 and held it for the remainder of the year in addition to his own duties of Chief Plague Medical Officer. The charge of the office of Assistant Director of Public Health, Southern Range, was held by Dr. K. A. Rahman from 1st April 1922 to 159th January 1923 on which date Captain R. C.

When compared with the previous year there was an increase both in the number of primary vaccinations and revaccinations performed during the year 1922-23 which in the case of the former amounted to 23109 in that of the latter to 34502. The reason for this increase is already stated in paragraph 6 of this report. Seventeen districts show an increase in numbers primarily vaccinated while 18 districts recorded an excess in revaccinations. The increase in revaccination was most marked in Ludhiana (10488), Lahore (6977), Gurdaspur(6924), Kangra (5686) and Hissar (5244). Total number of persons vaccinated by District Staff.

The annual figures are :6 The Java modification of my original system of lymph cultivation having been favourably reported on by the Director, Central Research Insti- tute, after a visit to the far east it was taken up experimentally towards the close of 1921-22. The experimental results being uniformly satisfactory the modification was adopted as standard during 1922-23. The modification con- sists in the introduction of the rabbit in my cow calf-buffalo calf cycle and so far has doubled the yield of a buffalo calf. Maximum potency on the cycle of alternation has not yet been attained, the indications being that the end point will be reached with a yield slightly under thrice that of the original cycle. During the year under review classes for training Superintendents and Vaccinators in the technique of vaccination and elementary hygiene were resumed at the Punjab Vaccine Institute at Lahore from January to March. Four classes, each lasting a fortnight were held and were attended by 4 Superintendents and 19 Vaccinators from the following districts :A.ii A.iii DEPARTMENT.

ANNUAL VACCINATION REPORT OF THE PUNJAB FOR 1928-24. 1. Statement No. I.No. 3174. FROM LIEUT.-COLONEL C. A, GILL, D.P.H., D.T.M. & H., I.M.S., Offg. Director of Public Health, Punjab, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, PUNJAB, TRANSFERRED DEPARTMENTS. Dated Lahore, the5th August 1924. SUBJECT :2 The Punjab Vaccine Institute was administered by the Assistant Director of Public Health (Technical), Vaccination. The post was held throughout the year by Khan Bahadur Dr. Abdur Rahman, Military Assist- ant Surgeon H. C. Phillips holding the appointment of Superintendent of the Punjab Vaccine Institute. Strength of Vacci- nation Establish- ment. Statement No. II. 3. The number of Superintendents of Vaccination employed by Munici- pal Committees and District Boards during the period under review remained the same as in the previous year, viz., 31. The total number of Vaccinators employed by local bodies during the year was 296 as compared with 294 in the preceding year. The increase of two vaccinators is due to the entertainment of three additional vaccinators in the Gujranwala District and one each in Jullundur, Ferozepore and Multan and a reduction of three vaccinators in Rawalpindi and of one in Sialkot. The strength of the Special Staff, who are Government employees, was two Superintendents and 20 vaccinators. These figures exhibit no change as compared with the previous year. Number of Vacci- nations. Statement No, I. 4. The total number of vaccinations and re-vaccinations performed by all establishments during the period under report was 943,263 as compared with 902,431 in the previous year, or an increase of 40,832. Of the above 674,203 were primary vaccinations (an increase of 25,150 as compared with the previous year) and 269.060 were re-vaccinations which also represents an increase of 15,882 as compared with the previous year. The increase of the total number of vaccinations in the absence of an epidemic of small-pox is satisfactory, and it is mainly attributable to the increased attention given to vaccination as the result of the re-organisation of the Public Health Department. These vaccinations were performed by the following vaccination estab- lishment :3 To summarize, 19 districts showed an increase in primary vaccinations as compared with 17 districts in the year 1922-23 whilst as regards re-vaccina- tion the number of districts exhibiting an increase was the same as in the previous year, viz., 18. In regard to re-vaccination the following districts showed a marked increase :4 A scrutiny of these indices shows that the poorly protected districts where special efforts are required to extend vaccination are Simla, Jhelum, Montgomery, Hoshiarpur and Gujrat. Special Staff. Statement No. I and its Appendix, 5. The Special Staff performed a total of 44,520 vaccinations as com- pared with 59,815 in the previous year (decrease 15,295). The number of primary vaccinations were 28,648 which is an increase of 6,503 as compared with the previous year and 15,872 re-vaccinations which is a decrease as com- pared with the previous year of 21,798. An increase in the number of primary vaccinations performed by the Special Staff is satisfactory in view of the fact that primary vaccination of infants in the Simla Hill States is unpopular. The decrease in the number of re-vaccinations when compared with the previous year is accounted for by the fact that steps were taken, as mentioned in last year's report, to prevent the performance of unnecessary re-vaccinations for the purpose of swelling the returns. Cantonment Staff. Statement No. 1 and Appendix. 6. During the year under report 6,456 vaccinations (4,827 primary and 1,629 re-vaccinations) were performed in cantonments by the Cantonment Staff of vaccinators These figures indicate an increase of 241 primary vaccin- ations and 907 re-vaccinations. Of the above 2,878 vaccinations were carried out in Ambala Cantonment, 1,036 in Rawalpindi Cantonment, 730 in Ferozepore Cantonment and 679 in Lahore Cantonment. Dispensary Staff. Statement No. III. 7. In only six districts out of 29 were any vaccinations performed by the Medical Officers in charge of Dispensaries The total number of these vaccinations was 870, the figures for the previous year being 1,203. The small number of vaccinations performed at dispensaries is disappointing. In many small towns where financial difficulties prevent the entertainment of a special vaccinator and where in many places there is not enough work for a whole-time vaccinator there is no reason why medical subordinates in charge of dispensaries should not perform the duties of a public vaccinator. House- to - house vaccination. 8. The total number of vaccinations performed by house-to-house visitation was 5,594 as compared with 8,325 and 17,090 in the two previous years. This system is not popular either with the people or with the vaccina- tors and except in special cases it should be allowed to fall into desuetude. Percentage of success. State- ment No. I. 9. The percentage of success of primary operations performed by all establishments during the year was 97.78 as compared with 96.67 in the pre- vious year, whilst in the case of re-vaccinations, the figures were 70.62 in 1923-24 as compared with 69.40 in the year 1922-23. The figures in the case of the District Staff, Special Staff, Cantonment Staff and Dispensary Staff were as follows : 5 compared with the previous year. This increase is due to the following reasons : 6 states that &quot; although bye-laws have been framed and sanctioned by Govern- ment, they are a dead letter. According to these bye-laws there ought to be three Vaccinators and three vaccination stations, whereas there was only one for the whole area with a population of 60,000.&quot; In Amritsar City there were no vaccination stations at the time of my inspection and in Ferozepore City the single vaccination station was located at an octroi post. In Multan City the arrangements for vaccination are much more efficient. In Amritsar City and also in Lahore City, where small-pox has for some time been present in epidemic form, it is the exception rather than the rule for small-pox cases to be notified to the Medical Officer of Health and, owing perhaps to the difficulty of enforcing it, the powers conferred by Section 141 of the Municipal Act are rarely utilized. Small-pox is the most easily eliminated of all diseases and it is hoped that by means of more vigorous efforts reinforced by propaganda Municipal Committees will assist the Public Health Department to eradicate this disease to a greater extent than in the past. There is also reason to believe that the number of reported deaths from small-pox considerably under-state the true mortality occasioned by this disease, whilst for reasons already stated, no reliable statistics in regard to its incidence can be given. These facts are being brought to the notice of all concerned and special attention will be devoted to the inspection of the vaccination arrangements in Municipal Towns during next cold weather. Inoculation. 14. The old practice of inoculation has not completely died out in the Punjab. The District Medical Officer of Health of Kangra reports some cases of inoculation in the Dehra and Palampur Tahsils of Kangra District. Some people were inoculated by a barber in Mahadev village and inoculation was also practiced round about Khaira in Palampur Tahsil. The exact number of operations in the latter case is not known. In Mahadev a child of three years of age developed a fatal attack of small-pox as the result of inoculation. In the case of three other persons a severe type of small-pox also occurred as the result of inoculation. A report was made to the Deputy Commissioner and a proclamation was issued warning people that inoculation was dangerous to life and should not be resorted to. Diagram. 15. A diagram showing the death-rate from small-pox per 1,000 of population during the year 1923-24, the average recorded death-rate from small-pox for the five years ending 1922-23, the proportion of successful vacci- nations in 1923-24, and for the preceding six years per 10,000 of population in each district of the Province is attached to this report. A scrutiny of this diagram serves to emphasise the fact that the districts with a low vaccination index during the past five years correspond precisely with the districts exhibiting a high small-pox death-rate during the year under review. The inference to be drawn from this fact is that the prevalence of small-pox epidemics is mainly dependent upon persistent efforts from year to year to increase the number of the protected population. It is to action on these lines rather than to spasmodic efforts to carry out vaccination during the time of epidemics that the reduction in small-pox mortality must be looked for. Vaccination in large Punjab States, 16. The reports received from those Punjab States which entertain their own vaccination establishments show that in Patiala 44,502 primary and 21,335 re-vaccinations were performed during the year under review. The corresponding figures for Bahawalpur State were 15,863 primary and 55 re-vaccinations, Faridkot report 5,046 primary and 986 re-vaccinations, Kapurthala 2,949 primary and 818 re-vaccinations whilst in Jind and Nabha 8,793 and 322 primary vaccinations were carried out. The above figures indicate a slight increase in the number of vaccina- tions in the States of Kapurthala, Jind, Bahawalpur and Nabha. The per- centage of succcss in primary cases was 93.85 in Faridkot, 98.85 in Patiala, 96.61 in Kapurthala, 95.63 in Jind, 99.65 in Bahawalpur and 80.85 in Nabha. In Patiala, Kapurthala, Faridkot and Bahawalpur the percentage of successful re-vaccinations was 77.27, 41.56, 30.42 and 94.00 respectively.
7 Punjab Vaccine Institute. 17. The total number of 1 gramme tubes of vaccine issued by the Punjab Vaccine Institute during the year was 41,083 as compared with 41,505 in the previous year. This shows a slight decrease of 422 in the number of tubes issued which calls for no comment. The vaccine was disposed of as follows:Aii Aiii PARTMENT. THE PUNJAB PROVINCE DURING THE YEAR 1923-24.

GILL, D.P.H., I.M.S., Offg. Director of Public Health, Punjab, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, PUNJAB, TRANSFERRED DEPARTMENTS. Dated Simla, the 12th August 1925. SUBJECT :2 districts of the Punjab was carried out under the general direction of the following officers .3 But the graph also shows not only that smallpox is still a cause of considerable mortality, but it demonstrates that from the year 1880 up to the year 1921 no marked reduction in the incidence of the disease has taken place. The precise effect of vaccination in reducing the smallpox mortality can be appraised by comparing the average annual smallpox mortality during the last five years (1910 to 1923) (334 per million) with the corresponding figure (1,388 per million) for the quinquennium immediately preceding the year 1880. It is, however, clear, since 77 per cent, of the total mortality during the period 1919 to 1923 occurred in children under ten years of age, that smallpox still takes a large toll amongst infants and young children. It is of interest to note that in England the corresponding figure, which in the quinquennium before the passing of the first Vaccination Act was 85.8 per cent., has now declined to 36 per cent. In order to obtain precise evidence regarding the incidence of smallpox amongst children it was arranged that the number of children showing obvious pitting of the face as the result of smallpox should be recorded at the time of taking the spleen census of school children in June 1924. As the result of this procedure 15,976 children attending some 500 schools located in all districts of the Province (save Simla, Sheikhupura, Shahpur, Lyalipur, where the instructions were either not understood or not carried out) were examined with the result that no less than 7.2 per cent. of these children were found to exhibit evidence of a previous attack of smallpox. The actual number of children examined in each district together with the &quot; pock-rate &quot; is shown in Table I from a scrutiny of which it will be seen that the percentage of children showing evidence of a previous attack of smallpox: varied from as high as 17.4 in Ludhiana district to 3.2 in Kangra district. TABLE I. The &quot; pock-rate &quot; of school children between 6 4 no permanent evidence of its occurrence it is clear that smallpox is widely pre- valent amongst infants and young children. In these circumstances it is pertinent to consider the number of primary vaccinations carried out in this province during recent years. From a scrutiny of Statement IV it will be seen that in a population of approximately 20 millions with an average birth-rate of 40 per mille (800,000 births per annum) about 500,000 successful primary vaccinations were carried out annually during the period 1867 to 1913 in- clusive, whilst during the period from 1914 to 1925 the figures were as fol- lows :5 tors belonging to District Boards, Local Bodies were urged either to appoint their own vaccinator or, with the permission of the Civil Surgeon, to place the Medical Officer of the local hospital or dispensary in charge of vaccination. As a means of judging roughly of the relative thoroughness of vaccination Medical Officers of Health and District Health Officers were required at the end of each vaccination season to submit the ' Vaccination Index &quot; (as defined in the last year's report) of the areas under their control. Finally the attention of the Assistant Directors of Public Health and other inspecting officers was drawn to the importance of inspecting the arrangements for vaccination and of checking the vaccination state of towns and villages during the course of their tours. Number of vaccina- tions. Statement No. I. 6. The total number of primary vaccinations and re-vaccinations carried out by all establishments during the year 1924-25 was 958,512 as compared with 943,263 daring the previous year. This represents an increase of 15,249 vaccinations, but as the operation had to be repeated in the case of 304 persons the total number of persons vaccinated was 958,208. Of the 957,531 persons vaccinated by the vaccinators employed by District Boards, Municipal Committees, Special Staff and Cantonment Staff, 547,861 were males and 469,670 were females but since there were 112.9 male births to every 100 female births in the year 1924 it would be anticipated, assuming that males and females were vaccinated in proportion to their number, that 485,262 females instead of 409,670 females would have been vaccinated. As male and female infants are presented for vaccination with equal readiness it must be assumed that relatively few adult females underwent re-vaccination. This presumption is borne out by the fact that, in the case of males, the number of re-vaccinations constituted 69.75 per cent. of the total number of males vaccinated whilst the corresponding figure in the case of females was 30.25 per cent. Primary Vaccination.6 and Gujranwala Districts. In rural areas the minimum number of vaccina- tors necessary for requirements is two per tahsil and this number has usually been provided but, as is shown in Statement No. I, the majority of the smaller Municipal towns employ no vaccinator but utilize (on payment) the occasional services of vaccinators belonging to District Boards In certain small towns the vaccinator is a part-time official who acts as a moharrir or even as a Sani- tary Inspector. This arrangement is unsatisfactory and Municipal Committees have been urged either to employ a whole-time vaccinator or to appoint the Medical Officer in charge of the local hospital or dispensary as their public vaccinator and to pay him a fee of Rs. 10 for each 100 successful primary vaccinations carried out by him. This procedure has been given effect to in a small number of towns but it is reported not to have proved a success. In most instances however the cause of failure is due to the fact that no fee was sanctioned for the public vaccinator by the local body. It is hoped that this omission will be made good and that the system of dispensary vaccination in small Municipal towns, Small Towns and Notified Areas will undergo a wide extension. In Dera Ghazi Khan District four small Municipal towns have combined to entertain a vaccinator and the District Health Officer is endeavouring to arrange a similar procedure in the case of certain small towns in Muzaffargarh District and as this system may prove applicable else- where it is proposed to bring it to the notice of other local bodies. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator of the District and Municipal staff was 2,929 in the year under review as compared with 3,061 during the previous year. The average figures by divisions for vaccinators of Municipal Towns and District Boards respectively were as follows: 7 Cantonment staff. Statement No. I and appendix. 9 In the cantonments that employ their own vaccinators 7,823 vacci- nations (4,662 primary and 3,161 re-vaccinations) were performed during the year under review as compared with 6,456 (4,827 primary and 1,629 re- vaccinations) in the preceding year. The average number of vaccinations performed by each vaccinator was 1,304 as compared with 1,076 in the previous year. Dispensary vacci- nation . Statement No. III. 10. In only six districts was vaccination performed by the Medical Officer in charge of the dispensary and the total number of operations performed was 677 as compared with 870 in the previous year. It should however be stated that the vaccinations performed in dispensaries located in Municipal towns are included in the Municipal returns and hence the total number of operations performed at dispensaries is not accurately known. As already stated it is hoped to extend the system of dispensary vaccination to many small towns where there is not sufficient work for a whole-time vaccinator. It is considered that the adoption of this proposal will not only provide more extended facilities for vaccinators in Municipal towns at a smaller cost than at present but it will also enable District Board vaccinators to carry out additional vaccinations in rural areas. Success of vacci- nation. Statement No. I and appendix. 11. Success of vaccination.8 The expenditure debitable to District Boards (Rs. 1,39,165) remained practically the same as last year but the expenditure incurred by Municipal Committees on vaccination exhibited an increase of Rs. 6,510 during the year under review. The average cost of each succesful vaccination was Re. 0-5-4 as compared with Re. 0-5-2 in the previous year. The cause of the increase has already been explained. The average cost of each successful vaccination carried out by District and Municipal Staff was Re. 0-3-9 as compared with Re. 0-3-8 in the previous year whilst the average cost of each successful vaccination performed by the Special Staff was reduced, owing to the increased number of vaccinations, from Re. 0-11-2 in the previous year to Re. 0-8-7 in the year under review Under the orders of the Government of India the whole cost of the pay and travelling allowance of the Assistant Directors of Circles which amount to approximately Rs. 21,475 is shown as a debit in calculating the cost of vaccination, but it should be explained that the in- spection of vaccination only forms a small part of the duties of these officers. The total sum chargeable to provincial revenue on account of vaccination operations including charges an account of the Punjab Vaccine Institute and the Special Staff of Vaccinators comes to Rs. 90,142 but against this sum must be placed Rs. 41,633 which has been realised and credited to Government on account of the sale of vaccine lymph. Vaccination Inspections. Statement No. V. 13. During the year I inspected the results of 60 vaccinations performed in the Simla Hill States by the Special Staff, of which 44 were primary and 16 re-vaccinations. The percentage of success was 81.82 and 50.00 respectively. I also inspected 486 primary vaccinations in 33 towns and villages of the Kangra District and found a percentage of success of 98.15. The Assistant Director of Public Health (Technical) Vaccination visited 45 villages in the Simla Hill States and verified the result of 226 primary and 521 re-vaccinations. The percentage of succes was 96.02 in the former and 49.33 in the latter. He also inspected 709 primary vaccinations in the Rawalpindi Circle where the percentage of success was 93.94. The Civil Surgeons and officers of the Public Health Department inspected 91,357 primary vaccinations and 28,472 re-vaccinations whilst the Superintendents of Vaccination inspected 383,766 primary and 135,042 re-vaccinations. The percentage of success reported by the above officers was 97.93 in primary cases and 66.55 in re-vaccinations, whilst the Superintendents of Vaccination reported that 96.68 primary and 73.68 re-vaccinations were successful. The Superintendents of Vaccination were required to submit periodically a nominal roll of the villages in which they carried out vaccina- tion inspections showing in each case9 the number of vaccinators has been increased by two making a total of one Superintendent and six vaccinators but this number is still insufficient to meet requirements. The number of vaccinations performed during the year was 16,352 as compared with 12,337 in the previous year. This increase in the number of vaccinations is however mainly attributable to special measures taken to combat a severe epidemic of smallpox. The &quot;Vaccination Index&quot; was 95.0 In Amritsar City (population 157,031) there is at present no Superin- tendent of Vaccination10 Lahore Division have achieved the unenviable distinction not only of showing a lower index than any other division but also of showing a decline in vaccination during the year under review as compared with the average figures for the preceding five years. Inoculation. 16. No instance of inoculation of matter derived from smallpox scabs came to light during the year and it would appear that this practice has almost completely died out in the Punjab.

xix APPENDIX C. Annual Report of the Punjab Vaccine Institute for the year 1924-25, by Khan Bahadur Dr. Abdur Rahman, D. P. H., Director, Punjab Vaccine Institute. Building. IN Lahore, beyond the annual repairs, nothing has been done except the filling in of a waterlogged and most insanitary depression in the south-west corner of the Institute. In Murree necessary repairs have been done to some of the followers' quarters which were very old, in a most dilapidated condition and practically falling down. These quarters are now in a serviceable condition and with ordinary annual repairs will last for years. The stables for calves under operation which were also in a dilapidated state have been thoroughly repaired, the roof has been raised and the building made fly proof. A portion of a small verandah has been enclosed to act as a calf operation room temporarily, but as this room is very small it is proposed to obtain sanction for funds to erect a suitable operation room next year. The snow pit has not proved of much use so far, in that the snow with which it is filled during the winter, melts by the end of August or beginning of September, thus neces- sitating the purchase of ice from Rawalpindi or snow locally when available. Last year the snow pit was thoroughly cement pointed throughout, the earth was rammed hard circumferen- tially, a wooden roof was put on, which is covered with thick felt over which a layer of malthoid has been placed. It is hoped that the snow pit will now act satisfactorily and meet the requirements of the Institute to the end of October. A retaining wall has also been built behind the clerks' quarters to prevent the hill side slipping during the rains and winter. New Works in 1926-27. The Veterinary Department at Lahore insist on the maintenance of a sufficient number of stables for keeping calves under observation before they are admitted to the pre-operation stables from which calves are taken for vaccination. I agree with the Veterinary Department that such stables are necessary and it is, therefore, proposed to include the cost (in the Schedule of New Expenditure on Major Works this year) of 4 stables, 2 godowns and 4 quarters for menials for whom there is inadequate accommodation at present. These stables and quarters will be erected in the south-west corner of the Institute. In Murree there are two buildings for followers which are in a very dilapidated condition and it is a sheer waste of money to repair them annually. It is, therefore, proposed to pull both of them down and crect two buildings one of which will be for the menial staff and the other will contain a sufficiently large operation room for calves, a sterilizing and wash room, two godowns and three quarters for the two Laboratory Assistants and the 3rd vaccinator. Just now sterilizing and washing up of apparatus is done in an outhouse and there are no quarters for the two Laboratory Assistants and the 2nd assistant vaccinator and no godowns for storing grass, gram, packing boxes, etc. These items are also being included in the Schedule of New Expenditure on works. Purchase of calves. As heretofore calves are obtained on hire at the rate of Rs. 5 a calf. This is the most satisfactory way of getting calves and on the whole cheaper than purchasing them and then selling them after the lymph has been taken and the vaccinated area healed, for the following reasons :xx Thus 20 calves purchased by the Institute and fed until healed, would cost Rs. 213, while only Rs. 40 would be recovered by their sale. Whereas 20 calves supplied by a contrac- tor on hire at Rs. 5 per calf cost Rs. 100. There is, therefore, a saving of Rs. 73 by the contract system on each batch of 20 calves and as about. 110 calves are thus obtained, the saving in a year is Rs. 401-8-0. Production of vaccine. The Java method of vaccine production has been adhered to during the year. By this method 3 vaccinifers are used, namely the buffalo calf, the cow calf and the rabbit. The buffalo calf is vaccinated with cow lymph, the cow calf with rabbit lymph and the rabbit with buffalo lymph. This rotation has resulted in a great increase in the yield of lymph per calf and the consequent decrease in the number of calves vaccinated and a corresponding decrease in the cost of calves and their maintenance as compared with the past. Glycerinated vaccine lymph is prepared in this Institute and it has been found to give most satisfactory results. The method of vaccine preparation is briefly as follows :xxi Altogether 114 buffalo calves were vaccinated but of these 11 failed to react. There were no failures among cow calves but among rabbits 11 were successfully vaccinated and 3 failed. 1,468 tubes of vaccine were in stock at the close of the last year and 42,783 tubes of vaccine were prepared during the year, making a total of 44,251 tubes. 43,035 tubes or 2,797,275 doses of vaccine were issued, thus leaving a balance of 1,216 tubes on 31st March 1925. The detail of the distribution of these 43,035 tubes is given in statement No. III. Training of vacci- nation staff. During the five months November 1924 to March 1925, 24 vaccinators and one Super- intendent of Vaccination from the following districts in the Panjab were given 14 days' course in Elementary Hygiene and Sanitation and the technique of vaccine preparation and vaccination by the Superintendent, Punjab Vaccine Institute :xxii STATEMENT No. I.

FROM LIEUT.-COLONEL W. H. C. FORSTER, D.P.H., I.M.S., Director of Public Health, Punjab, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, PUNJAB, TRANSFERRED DEPARTMENTS. Dated Lahore, the 16th August 1926, SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward for the information of the Punjab Gov- ernment (Ministry of Education) the Annual Vaccination Returns for the year 1925-26. The previous reports for 1923-24 and 1924-25, briefly noticed the more important points in the vaccination returns. The present report deals more fully with the vaccination work performed during the triennium ending 31st March, 1926. Administrstion. 2. During my absence on leave Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Gill, I.M.S., officiated as Director of Public Health from 1st April, 1925 to 25th February, 1926, Khan Bahadur Dr. K. A. Rahman from 26th to 28th February, 1926, and from 1st March, 1926, I resumed charge. Khan Bahadur Dr. K. A. Rahman held charge of the office of Assistant Director of Public Health (Technical) Vaccination and the Rawalpindi Circle, Captain R. C. Malhotra, O.B.E., I.M.S., held charge of the office of Assistant Director of Public Health (Technical) Epidemiology and the Ambala Circle, and Assistant Surgeon H. C. Phillips, I.M.D., held charge of the post of Superintendent, Punjab Vaccine Institute, throughout the year under review. Strength of Vacci- nation Establishment. Statement No. II. 3. The total number of Superintendents of Vaccination and vaccinators employed by local bodies in the Province during the triennium under review is shown in the table below :2 With regard to the experiment of employing female vaccinators for purdah women, accepted by Government, no great progress has been made. Four of the seven towns listed for the experiment have agreed to employ a female vaccinator but the local authorities are apathetic on the subject and women willing to be trained for the work cannot be found. I doubt the possibility of ever obtaining a staff of female vaccinators corresponding to the existing male staff. It has now been arranged to train all lady health visitors as vaccinators and for years to come reliance will have to be placed on them and lady doctors willing to undertake the work. In Simla the lady health visitor has proved invaluable as a vaccinator and a detector of con- cealed cases of smallpox. The average number of vaccinators employed during the triennium under report was 310 as against 312 in the preceding period. The number of superintendents and vaccinators of the special staff, viz., 2 and 20 respectively, remained the same as last year. Cost of the De- partment. State- ment No. II. 4. The total cost of the department during each year of the triennium is given below : 3 House -to-house vaccination. 7. A total of 16,955 operations were performed under the house- to-house system during 1925-26 in the towns of Hissar, Panipat, Karnal, Shahabad, Simla, Hoshiarpur, Ludhiana, Jagraon, Raikot, Khanna, Lahore, Amritsar, Sialkot, Wazirabad, Akalgarh, Ramnagar, Qilla Didar Singh, Multan, Shujaabad, Khanewal and Muzaffargarh as against 9,918 in the previous year. In some towns this system has been reported to be imprac- ticable owing to the inadequacy of the vaccination staff available. District Staff. Statement No. I. 8. The total number of operations performed by the district staff during the triennial period under report amounted to 2,893,786 as against 2,478,763 during the preceding triennium. Of the total number of operations 1,981,9 were primary and 911,855 re-vaccinations, showing an increase of 140,782 in the former and of 274,241 in the latter as compared with the triennium 1920-23. Compared with the previous triennium the increase in primary vaccination was shared by all the districts except Rohtak, Karnal, Lahore, Sialkot, Gujranwala, Lyallpur, Jhang and Muzaffargarh, while that in re-vaccination was recorded in all the districts except Karnal, Gurdaspur, Gujranwala, Montgomery and Jhang. The increase in primary vaccination was most marked in Gurgaon (15,495) ; Ambala (13,089) ; Multan (12,828) ; Attock (11,316) and Kangra (10,066) while that in re-vaccinations in Kangra (47,099) ; Hoshiarpur (24,131) ; Gurgaon (20,829); Amritsar (20,329); Jullundur (19,174); Muzaffargarh (18,384); Multan (17,794) Dera Ghazi Khan (17,469) ; Lahore ( 17,103) ; Hissar (16,782) and Ludhiana (16,414). When compared with the previous year the increase in the number of primary vaccinations and re-vaccinations performed during the year 1925-26 amounted to 63,613 and 181,082 respectively. The reasons for this increase are stated in paragraph 6 of this report. Twenty-five districts showed an increase in numbers primarily vaccinated while 26 districts recorded an excess in re-vaccination. The increase in primary vaccinations was most marked in Dera Ghazi Khan (6,107) ; Montgomery (5,973) ; Ferozepore (5,444) and Lyallpur (5,021) and that in re-vaccinations in Lahore (21,088); Kangra ( 19,475) ; Muzaffargarh (18,009) ; Multan (14,297); Sialkot (13,094) and Rawalpindi (10,993). Total number of persons vaccinated by District Staff. State- ment No. I. 9. The number of persons vaccinated by the district staff in the triennium under report was 2,888,063 as against 2,470,156 in the preceding triennial period, showing an increase of 417,607. During the year under report the persons vaccinated amounted to 1,118,641 as compared with 878,603 in 1924-25, an increase of 210,038. Percentage of successful operations by all establish - ment. 10. The percentage of success of the operations performed by all establishment in 1925-26 was 96.54 in primary vaccinations and 70.95 in re-vaccinations against 98.19 and 72.52 in 1924-25 and 97.78 and 70.62 re- spectively, in 1923-24. The reduced success rate in 1925-26 was due to the following circumstances : 4 The percentage of unknown cases to the total number vaccinated in the year under report was 6.95 in the case of primary and 19.76 in that of re-vaccinations. The corresponding figures for the years 1923-24 and 1924-25 were 5.37 and 5.56 in the case of primary and 17.96 and 19.09 in that of re-vaccination. Ratio of persons, successfully vaccina- ted by District Staff. Statement No. I. 12. The ratio of persons successfully vaccinated by the district staff during the year 1925-26 was 42.37 per mille, compared with 35.78 in 1924- 25 and 35.99 in 1923-24. The average rate during the triennial period under review was 38.05 as against 34.32 for the previous triennium. Special Staff total operations. State- ment No. I and its Appendix. 13. The total number of operations performed by the special vaccina- tion staff during the triennium under report was 173,060 of which 90,033 operations were primary and 83,027 were re-vaccinations5 Vaccination amongst railway employees residing on the pre- mises belonging to the North- Western Railway. 17. During the year under report the railway medical staff was made responsible for the vaccination amongst railway employees and the returns received from them show that 1,373 primary vaccinations and 1,194 re-vaccina- tions were performed during the year with a percentage of success of 97.44 in the case of primary vaccinations and 66.52 in that of re-vaccinations. Inspection work. Statement No. V. 18. The Assistant Director of Public Health (Technical) Vaccination, inspected Keonthal, Theog, Kiarkoti and Kumharsin Hill States of the Simla District, and 22 villages and 2 towns of the Montgomery District. His inspec- tions showed a success rate of 95.9 per cent. and 93.7 per cent. in the case of primary and re-vaccinations, respectively. The Assistant Director, Vaccination, inspected 27 towns and 244 villages in his circle, his results showing a success rate of 97.1 per cent. and 69.6 per cent. in the case of primary and re-vaccinations, respectively. District Medical Officers of Health, Urban Medical Officers of Health and Civil Surgeons conjointly inspected 120,274 primary and 46,595 re-vacci- nations, the reported success rate being 96.1 and 70.2, respectively. The Superintendents of Vaccination inspected 397,841 primary vaccina- tions with a success rate of 96.9 per cent. and 167,872 re-vaccinations with a success rate of 65.7 per cent. The vaccinators reported 96.5 per cent. success in primary vaccinations and 70.9 in re-vaccinations. Superior inspection of vaccination has now been delegated to the District Medical Officers of Health, the Diector and his Assistants only under- taking inspection for special purposes. Vaccination in Large Punjab states. 19. The number of vaccinations performed in the large states, which employ their own vaccinators, was as follows :6 The District Health Officer, Muzaffargarh, reports that investigations made as to the origin of smallpox when it was reported from Kacha Hangla Ichha, Ilaqa Rojhan, Dera Ghazi Khan district, during the last vaccination season, by chance revealed that the practice of inoculation was in vogue in Bahawalpur State, and that a professional class &quot; Dhukars &quot;, were responsible for this. The matter was reported to the deputy commissioner for represen- tation to the state authorities. Diagram. 22. A diagram showing the death-rate from smallpox per 10,000 of population during the year 1925-26, the average recorded death-rate from smallpox for the five years ending 1924-25, the proportions of successful vaccinations during the year 1925-26 and during the preceding six years per 10,000 of population in each district of the province is attached to the report. Punjab Vaccine Institute. 23. A brief report by Khan Bahadur Dr. K. A. Rahman on the work of the Punjab Vaccine Institute during the year 1925-26 is given in Appendix C. The number of one gramme tubes of vaccine lymph issued during the year was 56,06 as compared with 43,035 in the previous year, an increase of 13,031 tubes. The supply issued was equivalent to 3,644,290 doses. In the last triennial Report I noted that the Java modification of my system of lymph production, on which the Institute was founded, had been adopted as standard and I am now in a position to give a final statement with regard to this system. Maximum potency on this cycle of alternation has now been attained and the yield is exactly double that obtained by my cycle. This has resulted in considerable saving as regards calves and their maintenance. The average yield of crude lymph from a buffalo calf under the various systems employed from time to time in the Province is as follows : A-VACCINE DEPARTMENT. STATEMENT No. I.ii A.iii DEPARTMENT.

DURING (be latter part of the financial year 1925-26 sanction was accorded to the erection of the following : ii (b) for the various works required to be executed in the Punjab Vaccine Institute at Lahore and Murree, plans and estimates for which have been submitted with this office letters No. 2041 and 2497, dated 80th April 1926 and 8th June 1926, respectively; and also those plans and estimates for which will be forwarded on receipt from the Public Works Department, very shortly. Inspection of vaccination. During the year I inspected 95 clinical tests performed with 23 brews of vaccine lymph. The case and insertion success was 100 per cent. On one occasion seven children who were vaccinated with two different test brews, did not show a single successful vesicle. These two brews were then used on eight other children and the seven children who had failed before were again done with the same brews. The3e 1 5 children on inspection 5 days later showed perfect results, every insertion having taken. It is difficult to explain the first failures but it is probable that the vaccine used had become quite inert owing to exposure to heat as the vaccinator who used the lymph was taken ill at the time and was next day admitted to hospital for Pneumonia. I also inspected the results of 1,088 re-vaccinations performed on prisoners in the Central Jail and the Borstal Institution, by the M. B., B. S., Medical Students, and vaccinators undergoing training at the Punjab Vaccine Institute. The case success was 42.02 per cent. This low figure may be attributed to the fact that the majority of the prisoners had previously been vaccinated on admission to the jails. During the prevalence of small pox in Lahore city, 166 (5 primary and 161 re-vacci- nations vaccinations were performed by Mr. Phillips, Superintendent, Punjab Vaccine, Institute, free of cost, at the Institute, with a case success of 100 per cent. and 68.06 per cent. respectively. Instructions regarding use of vaccine lymph. Fresh instructions regarding the use of vaccine lymph were drawn un and issued to indenting officers for distribution among vaccinators, and it is hoped that these instructions will lead to more successful vaccination results. Training of vaccinators 18 vaccinators and 8 candidate vaccinators (from the following districts, were given the usual course of training (the former for a fortnight and the latter for 4 weeks) in elemen- tary hygiene, sanitation, and the technique of vaccine preparation and vaccination by the Superintendent of the Punjab Vaccine Institute :iii Finally acknowledgments are due to Mr. Phillips, Superintendent of the Punjab Vaccine Institute and to the clerical establishment of the office of the Assistant Director of Public Health, Punjab (Technical) Vaccination, for the manner in which they responded to the heavy calls made upon them both in connection with the normal work and heavy demands for vaccine lymph during the year.

FORSTER, D.P.H., I.M.S., Director of Public Health, Punjab, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, PUNJAB, TRANSFERRED DEPARTMENTS. Dated Lahore, the 8th November 1927. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward for the information of the Punjab Government (Ministry of Local Self-Government) the Annual Vaccination Returns for the year 1926-27, and to make the following report in regard to the progress of vac- cination during the period under review. Administration. 2. I was in charge of the Department throughout the year. Khan Bahadur Dr. K. A. Rahman held charge of the office of Assistant Director of Public Health (Technical) Vaccination throughout the year under report and Mili- tary Assistant Surgeon H. C. Phillips, I.M.D., held the post of Superinten- dent, Punjab Vaccine Institute, throughout the year. Strength of Vacci- nation establish- ment2 Cost of each suc- cessful vaccination- Statement No. II. 5. The average cost of each successful vaccination works out at Re. 0-5-1 against Re. 0-4-9 in the preceding year. If, however, the sum of Rs. 50,859-11-0 which has been credited to Government on account of the sale of vaccine is deducted from the total expenditure the average cost is reduced to Re. 0-4-3, as against 0-4-0 in the preceding year. The districts in which the cost of each successful vaccination was the highest were Hissar (0-8-0) and Ambala (0-6-5) and the districts showing the lowest cost of each successful vaccination were Gurgaon, (0-2-9) ; Kangra (0-2-2) ; Dera Ghazi Khan (0-2-2) and Muzaffargarh (0-1-10). The increase in the cost of a successful case is ascribable partly to a decrease in the number of successful vaccinations and partly to the causes in- dicated in the preceding paragraph. Total operations done by all estab- lishments3 Special Staff. Total operations4 and 59 and Jind, 8,593 primary operations only. These figures show a small increase in the number of persons vaccinated, as compared with the previous year, in the States of Nabha, Jind and Kapurthala. The percentage of success in primary vaccination was reported to be 99.36 in Patiala, 99.60 in Bahawalapur, 69.30 in Kapurthala, 89.08 in Nabha 99.55 in Faridkot and 98.20 in Jind. In Patiala, Bahawalpur, Kapurthala, Nabha and Faridkot the percentage of successful re-vaccinations was 75.31, 88.89, 53.10, 79.59 and 78.95 res- pectively. Vaccination in Municipal towns. 18. Of the total number of children available for vaccination in the towns in which the Vaccination Act is in force 87 per cent. were successfully vaccinated as against 88 in the previous year, whilst the percentage of success- ful vaccinations in the case of towns in which vaccination is not compulsory was 66 per cent during the year 1926-27, as compared with 56 per cent. in 1925-26.

Secretary to Government, Punjab, Transferred Departments, To THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH, PUNJAB. Dated 10th April 1929. SUBJECT:2 the efficacy of vaccination, but rather that, while they realise the advantages of vaccination and have recourse thereto in the presence of danger, the natural tendency of the inhabitants of remote areas is to neglect precautions until the danger becomes very obvious. Government, how- ever, are of opinion that the work of the special staff in the Hill States is of extreme importance and should be continued, as one of the lessons learned from the epidemic of cholera in Kulu in 1928 was the menace to British territory from epidemics spreading from territories over which Government have no control, and the experience of Kulu last year and of the hills generally in the influenza epidemic of 1918 was that an epidemic can spread with amazing rapidity in the apparently healthy mountain valleys. 6. Government agree with you that the figures for successful vaccination and re-vaccination show that the vaccine lymph supplied was of a high standard, and congratulate the officers of the Public Health Department who are responsible for this result. 7. The fact that a large number of the towns which have intro- duced the compulsory provisions of the Vaccination Act have so far failed to draw up suitable rules to carry out the purposes of the Act is unsatis- factory, and the Ministry proposes to take steps to bring this important matter to the notice of local bodies. 8. Since the close of the year under report an Act has been passed by the Legislative Council which will enable district boards as well as municipal committees to extend the benefits of compulsory vaccination to areas under their control. 9. Government view with satisfaction the fact that a start has been made in employing female vaccinators and health visitors for vaccinating purdah ladies and trust that this useful system will be extended. 10. The practice of small-pox inoculation referred to in the report as having been carried out by certain persons unknown in a village in the Mianwali district, and the possibility of the practice being carried on in remote villages elsewhere are matters which require careful watching. A report should be submitted to Government if further information comes to light. 11. The diagram attached to the report is an interesting exposi- tion of cause and effect. Although there are exceptions and variations, it shows clearly that the higher the number of successful vaccinations the lower is the incidence of small-pox. The district of Montgomery should take to heart the lesson to be deduced from the fact that with the lowest record of vaccination in the past five years it has the highest small-pox record for that period and, with one exception, the highest record of small-pox also in the year under report. It is observed that the table is drawn up in order of merit based on the number of vaccina- tions per 10,000 of the population during the five years preceding the year under report and it is noteworthy that out of nine districts where the death rate per 10,000 was 5 or more during the year in question no less than seven are in the second half of the table. 12. In conclusion I am desired to congratulate you and your officers on a satisfactory year's work, and in particular to request that the appreciation of Government may be conveyed to the officers whose services you have brought to the notice of Government in paragraph 19 of your letter under reply. I have, etc., ALAN MITCHELL, Offg. Secretary to Government, Punjab, Transferred Departments. 76 CSERRATA. Annual Vaccination Report of the Punjab for 1927-28. 1. Statement No. 1No. 16567-G. FROM LT.-COL. C. A. GILL, D.P.H., I.M.S., Director of Public Health, Punjab, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, PUNJAB, TRANSFERRED DEPARTMENTS. Dated Lahore, the 24th November 1928. Public Health SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward for the information of the Punjab Gov- ernment (Ministry of Local Self-Govornment) the Annual Vaccination State- ments for the year 1927-28 and to make the following report in regard to vaccination during the period from April 1st, 1927 to March 31st, 1928. Administration. 2. During the year under review the office of Director of Public Health, Punjab, was held by Lieutenant-Colonel W. H. C. Forster, D.P.H., I.M.S., from 1st April to 10th November and from the latter date to March 31st, 1928, by Lieutenant Colonel C. A. Gill, D.P.H., I. M.S. The post of Assistant Director of Public Health (Technical) Vaccination was held by Khan Bahadur Dr. Abdur Rahman, D. P. H., from April 1st, 1927, to March 31st, 1928, except for four months (from June 1st to September 30th) during which period Dr. A. H. Butt, D.P.H., Assistant Director of Public Health, Rawalpindi Circle, held the post as an additional charge. The post of Superintendent of the Punjab Vaccine Institute was held throughout the year by Lieutenant H. C. Phillips, I.M.D. Strength of Vacci- nation Establish- ment2 The total number of vaccinators employed by local bodies was 401 as compared with 371 in the previous year. The increase is due to the enter- tainment of ten additional vaccinators in Gurgaon district, seven in Shahpur, four in Gujranwala, three each in Sialkot, and Lyallpur and two each in Hoshiarpur and Rawalpindi and one each in Kangra, Ferozepore, Amritsar, Sheikhupura, Attock and Mianwali. There was a reduction of two vaccinators in Ambala, Jhelum and Jhang respectively and of one in Montgomery. Total operations done by all estab- lishments3 Special Staff. Statement No. I and its appendix. 6. The strength of the Special Vaccination Staff, which comprises two Superintendents of Vaccination, and 20 Vaccinators, remained unaltered throughout the year. This staff performed 52,966 vaccinations as compared with 86,036 in the previous year. The number of primary vaccinations shows a decrease of 446 as compared with the previous year, the figures being 16,617 in 1927-28 as compared with 17,063 in the previous year, but the number of revaccinations fell from 68,973 in the year 1926 27 to 36,349 in the year under report. The small decrease in the number of primary vaccinations calls for no explanation; the decrease in he number of revaccinations is attributed, partly to the relative absence of small-pox during the greater part of the year, and, partly to the fact that the inhabitants of the Hill States, where these vacci- nators are mainly employed, still evade vaccination in the absence of an epidemic of small-pox. Much time is lost in persuading the people to submit to vaccination and the State Authorities do not always welcome the arrival of the vaccinators or afford them facilities in the way of transport. Steps have been taken to overcome these difficulties, but it is for consideration whether the time has not arrived when these States should arrange to have their own subjects trained in vaccination and assume responsibility for vaccination in their respective areas. Cantonment Staff. Statement No. I and its appendix. 7. In Cantonments that employ their own vaccinators 7,229 vaccina- tions (4,356 primary and 2,873 revaccinations) were performed during the year under review, as compared with 8,439 (4,049 primary and 4,390 revaccina- tions) in the preceding year. The largest number of operations was per- formed in the cantonments of Rawalpindi, (1,519) ; Ambala, (1,358) ; and Ferozepore, (827). The inspection of vaccination in Cantonments is now undertaken by the Cantonment authorities. Dispensary Staff. 8. During the year under report 3,605 persons were vaccinated by medical officers in charge of dispensaries. Of these 1,989 were primary and 1,616 were revaccinations, the figures for the last year being 1,752 and 1,222, respectively. The dispensary system of vaccination in districts has on the whole proved a failure, but it is reported that in the Hissar district this system was successfully employed in the Small Towns of Mandi Dabwali, Budhlada and Fatehabad during the year under report. This system was also employed in the towns of Pathankot, Dinanagar, Dera Nanak, Fatehgarh, Dhariwal (Gurdaspur District) Firozpur-Jhirka, Sohna, (Gurgaon District) Bhakkar, Isakhel, Kala- bagh, (Mianwali) and Garh Maharaja (Jhang District). Vaccination was also performed in the towns of Ferozepore district by Sub-Assistant Surgeons in charge of dispensaries, but it would seem that their duties are so onerous that they are unable to devote sufficient time to vaccinate a few hundred children and to compile the registers. Again, in the municipal town of Pindigheb (Attock District) only 6 primary vacci- nations were performed by the Assistant Surgeon in charge of the dispen- sary. In the Lyallpur district, the dispensary system of vaccination is in vogue in the town of Toba Tek Singh but the Medical Officer is reported to be unable to spare sufficient time for the work. The Vaccination Act has recently been extended to this town and the committee would be well advised to engage a whole-time vaccinator. In Khanewal and Mian Channu towns. (Multan District) dispensers attached to the local dispensaries have acted as part-time vaccinators but the dispenser of the former town has not been trained in vaccination, and in both towns a whole-time vaccinator might well be employed. These illustrations clearly show that the time has not yet come when the medical officer in charge of the local dispensaries can be entrusted with the duties of a public vaccinator and it is consequently necessary that this duty should be carried out by a staff of vaccinators working under the direct orders of the District Medical Officer of Health. Vaccination amongst railway employees. 9. During the year under report the railway medical staff performed 581 primary vaccinations and 2,726 revaccinations as compared with 310 primary vaccinations and 848 revaccinations last year. Success of vaccina- tion.4 were 70.82 per cent., as compared with 71.57 per cent. in the year 1926-27. The result obtained by the various vaccination establishments was as follows :5 Of the total number of children available for vaccination in the towns in which the Vaccination Act is in force, 80 per cent. were successfully vaccinated as against 57 per cent. in the previous year whilst in the case of towns in which, vaccination is not compulsory, the figure was 55 per cent. as compared with 66 per cent. in the year 1926-27. Attention has repeatedly been called in these reports to the inadequacy of the arrangements made for vaccination, and more especially the in- sufficient number of vaccination stations, in the cities and large towns. In Amritsar City this defect was in some measure remedied by the appointment of five male and one female vaccinator for a period of 3½ months It is hoped that the Medical Officers of Health of other large towns will be able to per- suade their Committees to follow this example, as vaccination can never be brought within easy reach of all classes of the people until additional vacci- nation stations have been opened in convenient situations throughout the municipal area. The employment of female vaccinators and Health Visitors (trained in vaccination) for vaccinating purdah ladies has been attended with success. A vaccination station for women was opened at the Health Centre at Feroze- pore and it is hoped that this example will be followed at Health Centres in other towns. The total number of notices issued by the District Vaccination staff and Municipal staff during the year in respect of emigrant and immigrant children amounted to 20,907 and 3,143, respectively, whilst the number of notices received amounted to 13,393 and 1,859. Speaking generally the Vaccination Act is not enforced with sufficient rigour. In Hissar town 81 cases of failure to comply with the Vaccination Act were referred to the Criminal Courts by whom they were adequately dealt with, whilst in Ambala municipality, as the result of 19 prosecutions, 14 persons had their children vaccinated. In Amritsar, as the result of 72 prosecutions, 60 perrons had their children vaccinated, whilst 12 cases were still pending. In Multan, legal action was taken against the guardians of 368 children for failure to comply with notices for vaccination and 208 children were vaccinated by the order of the court. In other towns, in which vaccina- tion is compulsory, a small number of persons were prosecuted, but the municipal committees in Montgomery District appear to be averse to taking legal action. Inspection work6 is practiced in remote villages adjoining the Bahawalpur State, but no instance of small-pox inoculation came to light in Multan or (with the above exception) in any other district.

Dated 10th March 1930. Public Health. SIR, I AM directed by the Punjab Government (Ministry of Local Self-Government) to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 19866, dated the 8th October 1929, forwarding a copy of the Annual Vaccina- tion Report for the year 1928-29 and to convey the following remarks. 2. The report of this year refers not only to the year 1928-29 but also to the period of three years ending on the 31st March 1929, and many of the general features of the period in question have already been noticed in connection with the report of the previous year Government note with interest that the progress of vaccination, as evidenced both by the number of successful primary vaccinations and the number of re-vaccinations, has shown steady and substantial progress throughout the three years in question. The figures for 1926-27 showed a consid- erable increase over the average of the previous three years, and each of the two succeeding years has shown an even more marked increase over its predecessor. While these figures give cause for satisfaction, it is observed that your report sounds two notes of caution2 only 8 vaccinators for 23 thanas. It was at first thought that a partial explanation of these figures might be due to the fact that the Lahore district naturally contains a large number of purely urban thanas, but enquiries have shown that the figure of 23 for the Lahore district refers to rural thanas only, and it is therefore clear that the Lahore district board will be well advised to increase its staff of vaccinators. It must not of course be forgotten that the number of thanas in a district is fixed not only with reference to its population but chiefly with reference to the criminality of that population. Lahore therefore may be able to claim that its crime index is so high that it has double the number of thanas ordinarily required and that therefore one vaccinator can successfully cope with two thanas. At the same time it is clear that the work in this district is already showing signs of improvement as in paragraph 6 of your report Lahore is shown as one of the districts in which there has been a large increase over the figures of the previous triennium. 4. As noted last year perhaps the least satisfactory feature of the vaccination work in the Province is that portion of it which is done in urban areas and particularly in the smaller towns. It is not easy to suggest an immediate remedy for this somewhat unsatisfactory position, but it is hoped that the continued efforts of your department will in time bear fruit. 5. The record of the activities of the special staff in 1928-29 is in direct conformity with the conclusions reached by Government last year that the natural tendency of the inhabitants of remote areas is to neglect precautions until the danger becomes very obvious. The figures show that the total number of operations in 1928-29 was more than double that in the previous year. This rise is explained by you as due to the efforts made by the Assistant Director of Public Health assisted by a severe outbreak of smallpox in some of the hill states. Which of the two is chiefly responsible for the increase is not explained, but while appreciating the work of the Assistant Director of Public Health, Government feel that the outbreak of smallpox was probably the main cause of bringing home to the people the need of vaccination. The members of the special staff and the Assistant Director of Public Health are, however, greatly to be congratulated on the results achieved, as it is only the presence of the staff and the confidence they have inspired among the inhabitants of the hill states that rendered it possible for the awakening caused by the epidemic to be translated into actual figures of increased operations performed. 6. Government note with some regret that the attempts made during the past three years to induce more town committees to adopt the dispensary system of vaccination have not been attended with great success, and they are inclined to agree with the view expressed by you that primâ facie the dispensary system should be suited to the needs of small urban areas. It seems necessary to persevere with the provision of this form of facility for vaccination wherever it exists, and the education of public opinion in the smaller towns of the Province should in time have its due effect. 7. It is satisfactory to note that the reference to the dangerous practice of smallpox inoculation in the report of 1928-29 has proved to be an isolated instance only and even so not definitely authenticated. 8. In connection with the figures showing the cost of vaccination operations, Government are inclined to agree with you that the expendi- ture on the pay and travelling allowance of the Assistant Directors of Public Health in charge of circles and their establishment should not be regarded entirely as a charge on account of vaccination. The functions of the Public Health Department have expanded in every direction, and it is clear that the supervision of vaccination operations is now only a small part of the duties of the Assistant Director of Public Health in charge of a circle. The exclusion of these figures, however, will for some years render it difficult to compare the cost of vaccination each year with the figures of the past and it is for consideration whether for the purposes of
3 estimating the cost of vaccination operations any portion of the expendi- ture on the supervising staff should be retained. The decision recently arrived at that the vaccination report should in future be included in the general public health report makes perhaps the present a convenient time for bringing about the change. The cost of the general public health staff will no doubt appear in the general public health report and when the vaccination report forms a section of the general report, it will per- haps no longer be necessary to debit to vaccination any portion of the general supervising staff. The question, however, is one that is not con- fined to the Punjab only, and before submitting your final conclusions on this matter to Government you will no doubt ascertain and take into consideration the practice in this connection in other provinces in India. 9 The figures showing the degree of success attained in the case of primary vaccinations referred to in paragraph 9 of your report and the statistics showing the increased demand for the lymph prepared in the Punjab Vaccine Institute both from within and without the Province show that the high standard of the Punjab Vaccine Institute is being well maintained, and reflect great credit on the staff responsible for these results. 10. The lessons to be drawn from the diagram attached to the report are much the same as referred to last year. If anything the advantage of sustained efforts over a number of years is emphasized this year even more clearly than last. There are again nine districts in which the death rate during the year under report exceeds 5 per 10,000, but this year the whole nine are in the second half of the table against seven out of nine last year, the table, as noticed then. being arranged in order of merit based on the number of successful vaccinations per 10,000 of the population during the preceding six years. 11. Government agree in the conclusions reached by you that the triennium marks a steady and satisfactory increase in vaccination, but that there is reason to fear that the disease is more prevalent than the official statistics suggest. It would also appear that public opinion is yet a long way from realizing the enormity of permitting persons suffering from dangerous diseases to mix with the general public and spread infection wherever they go. The case referred to in your report where the parents of a student sued the University authorities for not permitting their son to remain in an examination hall when found to be suffering from smallpox is, as remarked by you, a striking illustration of this attitude on the part of the general public, and it would be interesting to know if the suit referred to was fought out in the courts, and if so, with what result. 12. In conclusion, I am once again to convey to you and your officers the appreciation of Government on the results achieved both during the year 1928-29 and throughout the whole triennium, and to request that the officers mentioned by you in the concluding paragraph of your report may be informed that the good work done by them has been brought to the notice of Government. I have, etc., ALAN MITCHELL, Secretary to Government, Punjab, Transferred Departments. 2177 CSERRATA. Annual Vaccination Report of the Punjab for 1928-29. 1.

GILL, D.P.H., I.M.S., Director of Public Health, Punjab, To ALAN MITCHELL, Esq., I.C.S., Offg. Secretary to Government, Punjab, Transferred Departments. Dated Simla, the 8th of October 1929. Public Health. SIR, IN forwarding for the information of the Punjab Government (Ministry of Local Self-Government) the annual vaccination statements for the year 1928-29, I have the honour to submit a brief note regarding the progress of vaccination during the year under review and during the triennium ending on March 31st, 1929. 2. Administration.2 It will be seen that the number of successful primary vaccinations during the triennial period under review shows an appreciable increase over the figure for preceding triennial periods. The figures for the triennial periods 1917-20 and 1920-23 were, however, distinctly smaller than those of the immediately preceding triennia. Thus, from the year 1917 to the year 1922, as. the result of the war, and of the non- co-operation movement which followed it, an appreciable decline in the annual number of vaccinations took place. It was, in fact, not until the year 1923-24 that vaccination regained its pre-war level. From this year onwards slow, but steady progress has been made, with the result that the figures for the triennial period under review exceeded the corresponding figure of the preceding triennium3 The Village Vaccination Register has enabled, for the first time, the work of the vaccination staff to be readily supervised both by the District Medical Officer of Health and by inspecting officers. These two features, combined with the increased supervision rendered possible by the pro- vision of a separate Medical Officer of Health for each district, are in the main responsible for the improvement of vaccination during the triennium. The same policy has not been attended with an equal measure of success in the case of municipal and small towns, but a small increase in the number of vaccinators and vaccination stations has taken place in municipal towns. It is satisfactory to note that, largely as the result of the efforts of District Medical Officers of Health, the Vaccination Act was adopted by 53 municipal and small towns (to which the Act was not extended until the year 1925) during the triennium under review4 before the thanewar system can be brought fully into operation. In the districts of Gurgaon, Ambala, Kangra, Hoshiarpur, Jullundur, Ferozepore, Sialkot, Gujrat, Shahpur, Rawalpindi, Montgomery, Lyallpur. Jhang and Dera Ghazi Khan the number of vaccinators is approximately equal to the number of thanas, but in Karnal there are only 8 vaccinators and 19 thanas, in Lahore 8 vaccinators and 23 thanas, in Jhelum 8 vaccina- tors and 12 thanas, in Mianwali 6 vaccinators and 12 thanas and in Muzaffargarh 8 vaccinators and 18 thanas. The municipal staff of vaccinators numbered 84 during the year under review, as compared with 83 in the previous year. The strength of the special staff of vaccinators, which comprises 2 superintendents and 20 vaccinators, underwent no change. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator (all establishments) during the triennium 1926-29 and during the preced- ing 3 years was 3,236 and 3,183 respectively, whilst the corresponding figures for the last three years were 5 6. Vaccination Staff.6 number of vaccinations performed per month by each municipal vaccina- tor shows great variation in different towns, the figures for Lahore being 546, Amritsar 606, Ferozepore 113, Sialkot 244, Lyallpur 592, Multan 268, Rawalpindi 767, Jullundur 205 and Ludhiana 159. One of the causes of these variations is the absence of an adequate number of vaccination stations, as the result of which house-to-house visits, instead of being confined to those who are unable or unwilling to attend at the vaccination station, is the main method by which vaccination is carried out. In the case of small towns and notified areas, some progress has been made in inducing them to employ a vaccinator, and in several instances two or more small towns have combined to share a vaccinator between them. In most cases, however, vaccination in these towns is carried out by vaccinators of the district staff, an arrangement which is to be deprecated, as the latter are already overworked and few towns can be completely vaccinated in the course of one short visit.
