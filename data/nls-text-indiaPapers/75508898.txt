ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN INDIA FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1904-1905. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. In Preface. This report is the first which has been submitted on the present lines. accordance with the recommendations of the Horse and Mule Breeding Com- mission, certain selected districts were handed over to the Army Remount De- partment and we have been relieved of all responsibility and control of military stallions in those districts. It was also decided by the Government of India that all diseases of soliped animals occurring in them should be dealt with by that Department. These districts have been coloured dark red in the map which accompanies this report, those under the management of the Civil Veterinary Department have been shown in light red and Veterinary Colleges and Schools, Cattle Farms, etc., are indicated by numbers. 2.But, while all matters connected with horse and mule breeding and the care of equine stock in selected districts have been removed, the Civil Veterinary Department retain control of the cattle breeding and disease and the treatment of other animals in villages and dispensaries. Thus, the operations of the Department extend over the whole of India, with the exception of the Native States, which have been shown white on the map. 3.The forms of tables which accompany this report are now brought into use for the first time. Being new and having been issued late in the year, they have not been furnished in as complete a manner as one would wish : but, it is hoped that by next year they will be more accurately rendered. Officers in charge. The following table gives the names of the officers who held the several appointments in the Civil Veterinary Department during the year under report:2 Appointments. 1st April 1904. 31st March 1905.

Sowerby, Esq. 4.During the year, the following officers were either absent on or returned from leave : Major Pease, Captain Baldrey, Captain Walker, Doctor Lingard, Major Raymond and Mr. Rennie. 5.Captain J. D. E. Holmes was deputed to England for a course of training in Bacteriology from 18th September 1904, and Major H. T. Pease was detailed on special duty in the United Provinces and Punjab for 3 months to investigate "Dourine". 6.The staff of Imperial Officers has received a small addition by the ap- pointment of two new men from home. Mr. R. E. Montgomery, who has been temporarily posted as Assistant Pacteriologist at Muktesar, and Mr. M. H. Sowerby to the Punjab for training. The strength of the cadre has thus been brought up to 22 (including the Imperial Bacteriologist) which is still far below requirements. Inspector- General's tour. 7. With regard to my tours of inspection, I attended the Rawalpindi Horse Show, visited Peshawar to inspect donkey stock collected for sale, inspected the Muktesar Bacteriological Laboratory, purchased mares for zebrule breeding, purchased mule and donkey stock for Hissar Farm, attended Amritsar and Sone- pore Fairs, attended purchasing Committees for Arab and Australian stallions, visited Burma and toured through some of the principal centres, visited Pusa and also the Central Provinces, toured through the Hariana District and purchased cows for Hissar Farm, and attended Gujrat Horse Show. The dis- tances travelled by me during the year were 14,087 miles by rail, 132 miles by road and 1,592 miles by sea. PART A.3 9.The results of the year's work in all these institutions have been satisfac- tory. Fifty-seven men passed the final examination of the three years' course, of which 34 were from the Punjab, 15 Bombay and 8 Bengal. The percentage of passes was, Punjab 82.05, Bengal 80.00, and Bombay 78.94. 10.Madras is a new college of great promise and is making satisfactory progress. The result of the year's work is very good, 20 students having passed the first yearly examination held by the Principal. Twenty new students have been admitted. 11.Ajmer, Bombay and Rangoon turned out 48 salutris. 12.There were 331 students remaining under tuition at the various colleges at the end of the yearly examinations and 262 new students were admitted. 13.Both the Ajmer School and the salutri class at the Bombay Veterinary College have been closed. The students and native teachers of the former have been transferred to the Punjab Veterinary College which is being enlarged and equipped for the training of 250 men. A European Gazetted Officer has been appointed as Professor of Sanitary Science and the building necessary for the accommodation of the extra men erected. Considerable improvement has also been made in the Bombay College. It has been decided that the residen- tial and educational buildings should be gradually erected in the grounds of Government House, Parel. The teaching equipment is also being much augmented. These improvements were sorely needed. 14.The development of the Bengal Veterinary Institution has necessitated the acquisition of a site for the extension of the college premises and the erection of additional buildings. This has been purchased for a sum of Rs. 2,15,948. 15.Besides the teaching of veterinary students, classes of transport dressers were held at the Punjab and Bombay Colleges, 40 men being trained at the former and 29 at the latter during the vacations. 16. Three men attended a post graduate course at the Punjab College and 9 Transport Officers were trained in the diagnosis of Surra in the camel. 17.A text book on shoeing has been written in Urdu by Major Pease and one of Hygiene by Prabhu Lall. The vernacular Veterinary Journal has been kept going. 18. All these improvements will tend to increased efficiency and a greater number of men will, it is hoped, be passed out to meet the demand which exists at present for trained men which is greatly in excess of supply especially for Punjab men. II.-TREATMENT OF DISEASE. Contagious disease amongst solipeds, out breaks, mor tality, etc. 19.Table If shows the reported mortality from the contagious diseases therein named, in the various Provinces. The Army Remount Department deal with contagious diseases of equines in the selected districts. 20.Glanders.4 25.The figures for the above diseases are absolutely unreliable. " Surra " is widespread in a great number of tracts of country almost every year and the mortality amongst soliped animals is very considerable as all attacked die. This disease has been scheduled under the Glanders and Farcy Act XIII of 1899. 26.Dourine " is probably not very widespread in the non-selected districts but the mortality has surely been greater than 3 in the whole of India. I have seen more stallions than this destroyed or dead myself. 27.Other contagious diseases.5 34.Bombay reports that no cases of Rinderpest occurred in that Presidency during the year and that no case of the disease could be found, although every enquiry has been made with the view of finding out whether it existed or not. 35.Anthrax.6 43.Contagious disease amongst other animals.7 III.8 the Punjab, the Imperial Government contributing Rs. 22,000 towards the cost. Every effort is made to conduct the breeding operations as cheaply as possible and no staff is maintained for branding or the collection of statistics. Doubt- less, much good will result from the methods adopted, in the way of improving indigenous stock and in mule breeding9 (iv) Observations on the Filarial Embryos found in the general cir- culation of the Equidæ and Bovidæ and their probable patho- logical significance. " Fasiculus I. Bursati", published by Adlard and Son, London. (v) The significance of the pyriform and globular bodies present in the circulation, organs and tissues in various forms of disease, in man and animals, respectively, with suggestions regarding their identi- fication and classification. 67. Table XV.10 75. In addition to the ordinary liquid serum, 3,538 doses of serum in powder were prepared and issued to Bengal and Burma for trial in the field. The experiments were not very conclusive as to its efficacy compared with the ordinary serum, but, in any case, unfortunately, it is not so well suited to our purposes as the latter, on account of the fact that no Carbolic or other antiseptic can be added to it and the powder must be used 24 hours after it has been made up into solution. It is considered inadvisable to trust Veteri- nary Assistants in this particular work in the field as it requires considerable care. Notwithstanding, therefore, the bulk and trouble in carriage, it is only in exceptional cases, such as those in which qualified Veterinary Officers are employed, that this dry serum can replace the ordinary liquid form as at present prepared in the Laboratory. 76. Anthrax.11 in Laboratory experiments, proved capable of accomplishing this. He has prepared 3,133 doses of this material which is now being tested in the field, and it is hoped will be found efficient. This disease causes very heavy annual losses and anything which tends to decrease it will be much valued by the people. Experiments are now being conducted with a view to ascertaining the length of time for which the conferred immunity lasts. 82. Dr. Lingard has continued his experiments with Surra and has endea- voured to produce immunity by means of a prophylactic or curative serum, by attenuating the trypanosoma by means of cultures and by passing it through bodies of animals other than equines. In addition to this, treatment with Trypanrot and arsenate of Soda have been tried. Unfortunately, none of these methods are of much practical value and we are still, after years of patient work, not only in our own Laboratory but in many others in America and on the Continent, as far off as ever from an efficient prophylactic or curative agent for this deadly and widespread disease. 83. Charbon Symptomatique has by its prevalence in certain parts of the country claimed a share of attention. It has unfortunately been so far found impossible to cultivate the Bacterium at Muktesar. Successful inoculations had been carried on in the Punjab by Captain Walker and Mr. Oliver last year with a protective vaccine prepared by Arloing, Cornevin and Thomas, but this was discontinued pending the preparation of a serum at the Laboratory. Owing to failure of obtaining culture we are again issuing this and it will be available during the coming year. I consider this very desirable as the inoculations so far made have been successful and the people are asking that their young stock may be protected by the method. 84. Dourine.12 90. One hundred and fifty Ordnance bullocks were supplied, thirty-six bulls were sold to the Punjab for work in the districts and two to Native States. The class of bull turned out was good and there is now a considerable demand for them. I consider that by steadily pursuing the policy of careful weeding out of unsuitable animals and selection of the best types, we shall be able to produce stock such as cannot be obtained any where else in India. The change effected is already very marked. The castings during the year only amounted to 26 cows, 8 female young stock and 1 herd bull which were all unsuitable. 91. Mules.13 been arranged with the Examiner of Local Fund Accounts, Punjab, to audit the accounts of the Hissar Cattle Farm about the end of September 1905, and to submit for the approval of the Government of India a revised set of account forms to be adopted in view to having the financial results of the Farm correctly shown in future. 99. In compliance with the request contained in Government of India, Revenue and Agricultural Department, letter No. 615-44-1, dated 13th April 1905, a special report will be submitted in October 1905 on the working of the Hisssar Cattle Farm since the transfer of its control to the Civil Veterinary Department. 100. To the zeal and ability of Captain Farmer, the Superintendent of the Farm, is due, in a great measure, the very good results obtained and I consider that very great credit is due to him for the work done during the year under report. PART C.-GENERAL. Expenditure of the Depart- ment. 101. Table XIX shows the total cost (Imperial and Provincial) of the Depart- ment during 1904-05 amounting to Rs. 10,82,352-11-0 against Rs. 8,24,319-13-7 in the previous year, showing an increase of Rs. 2,58,032-13-5. This table embodies the figures furnished by the Comptroller, India Treasuries, as regards Imperial contributions, as well as those received from the several Accountants General as affecting Provincial expenditure. Of the latter it has, however, to be noted that the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, has reported that as the present Table is a new form this year there has been some trouble experienced in the Accountant General's Office in supplying the desired particulars. It appears that the Accountant General can readily supply the Provincial figures but difficulty arises over the Imperial and Local expenses. In future years it is to be hoped the expenditure incurred under the different sources, will be more accurately rendered. 102. The principal headings of expenditure under which increases appear, as compared with the figures of the previous year, are salaries of officers and Establishment, Travelling allowances of officers, purchase of stallions, and Veterinary Colleges and Schools. These increases are due to the extension and expansion of the Department. General Re- marks. 103. Much correspondence has taken place on the subject of the reorganiza- tion rendered necessary by the transfer of the selected districts and proposals have been made regarding the development and expansion of the subordinate staff and the establishment of cattle breeding and rearing Farms, etc. Considerable advance has been made in almost every Province in the establishment of a Subordinate and supervising Veterinary Staff as the need has arisen and the men become available. 104. Great progress has been made in every Department of our work. The Veterinary Colleges have been improved and enlarged: improvement has been made with the Hissar Farm and in the establishment of breeding farms, and many new Veterinary dispensaries have been opened. There has been a consider- able increase in the number of cattle inoculated against contagious disease. 105. Horse and mule breeding in the non-selected districts under the con- trol of this Department, are very popular and results during the year are good. 106. The investigations into the prevalence, means of spread and methods of limiting or stamping out " Dourine " amongst breeding stock which will save Government a considerable sum, as well as the discovery of Horse Pox (the last named causing symptoms closely resembling Dourine) is due to the energies of Major H. T. Pease, to whom the thanks of the Government of India are due for having brought to light the existence of a disease so seriously affecting the horse breeding interests of the country. " White Scour " has been found among foals at the Probynabad Stud Farm and other private studs and is being investi- gated by Captain Baldrey. A new preventive serum for Hæmorrhagic Septi- cæmia has been prepared by Dr. Lingard and satisfactory work is generally noticeable in almost every branch. The cost of the Department has somewhat increased, as compared with last year's expenditure, but this must be expected with corresponding expansion and development. SIMLA ; J. W. A.
