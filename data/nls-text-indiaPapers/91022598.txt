REPORT ON VACCINATION THROUGHOUT THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY AND SIND FOR THE YEAR 1873-74. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Bombay : PRINTED AT THE GOVERNMENT CENTRAL PRESS. 1874.
No. 2085 OF 1874. FROM THE SURGEON GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT. Bombay, 9th July 1874. I have the honour to forward the Annual Report on Vaccination for the year 1873-74, in which there are many points of interest. 2. The total number of persons operated on was 652,223, which is 63,866 over the preceding year ; the most marked increase being in the itinerant establishment, which accounts for 61,684 of the total increase. The dispensaries show an increase of 1,358, and the army of 824. 3. This large increase in the numbers vaccinated and re-vacci- nated shows probably not only greater exertion on the part of the Superintendents and their subordinates, but also increased apprecia- tion on the part of the people, evidenced by greater willingness on their part to submit their children to the operation ; but the largest factor is undoubtedly the increase in the number of vaccina- tors and the constant supervision over them exercised by the Assis- tant Superintendents. This has resulted from the reorganiza- tion of 1871. 4. Where progress has not been so great, the Superintendent General attributes the want to the vaccinators being too few in number for the population and area. 5. It is gratifying to know that among so many vaccinators, in. only one instance was a register found incorrect ; and even this may be attributed to carelessness on the part of the vaccinator, rather than to an attempt to falsify the record, as it extended to only 6 names altogether. I may here add that the conduct of the vaccinators in general has been satisfactory. 6. The percentage actually verified by Superintendents comes so near to the numbers given by the vaccinators that, in my opinion, the latter may be accepted as correct, and these show a good amount of successful work done. a
2 7. The disparity between the sexes, which was formerly so great, has, by more careful registration, been reduced; and last year the males were 52.8 to 47.2 females in each 100, being a difference of 5.6, whereas in 1866 this amounted to 10. 8. The percentages of caste are much the same as for several years back. 9. There was an increase in the number of infantile vaccina- tions of 37,059, which is more than half the total increase ; the percentage of children under one year in the total vaccinated is 38, or 1.2 higher than in the preceding year. Dr. Pinkerton thinks that probably 41 or 42 per cent. of infantile vaccinations is about the highest that can be reached by an itinerant establishment, such as ours is. In this view I concur. But where large populations are stationary, as in Bombay City, a much higher ratio can be obtained3 proves. Last year the lymph supplied from England was not so successful as usual and no reason can be given for it. The Secretary of State might be requested to communicate the source of each supply sent out. 12. Animal vaccination is still carried on, and is very much esteemed in Bombay ; and though the percentage of success is not so high as when human lymph is used, still it must always be viewed as a valuable adjunct ; as here, few persons allow lymph to be taken from the vesicles on their children, and some parents prefer the animal to human lymph. 13. Although there has been an increase in the total expendi- ture of the department, the cost of each successful vaccination has been less by 6 pies than in the preceding year. 14. The progress of vaccination is satisfactory in all Govern- ment districts, except Belgaum and Dharwad. A further extension would follow an increase in the number of vaccinators there, and the Superintendent General wishes the attention of the Collectors called to the advisability of having more than one taluka vaccinator where the population exceeds 100,000. In Native States, the pro- gress has been satisfactory, and promises further improvement. Although vaccination at dispensaries may not be all that can be desired, still some progress has been made and more will gradually follow. I am glad to observe that several of the officers in charge of dispensaries have been favourably noticed by Dr. Pinkerton, espe- cially Assistant Surgeon Mackenzie and Honorary Surgeon Sinclair. 15. The Superintendent General views with anxiety and fore- boding of ill the falling off in the numbers vaccinated in Bombay, and he is of opinion this can be met only by a compulsory Vacci- nation Act. Certainly the results are altogether disproportionate to the cost. The reason of this is evidently due chiefly to there being a Superintendent to so small a circle as Bombay Presidency Circle is, his pay alone adding about 7 annas to the cost of each successful case. Speaking generally, it is difficult for a vaccinator in a city to vaccinate as many as he can do in a rural district. 16. As regards inoculation, Dr. Turnbull notices that it had been practised in the Wái Táluká, but the Superintendent General is unable to say to what extent. It is evident there could have been, very little of it. 17. The Superintendent General thinks no reliance can be placed on the record of deaths from small-pox for statistical purposes. 18. Dr. Pinkerton estimates the population at 24½ millions, which includes the civil population of Mhow, Nimach, and Nasirabad, and he thinks there are at least 735,000 births per annum. After writing off 1/13th of the births for deaths, &c., he considers the depart-
4 ment might vaccinate 678,462 children primarily, or probably even more, according to the annual increment of population. He takes the birth-rate at 30 per mille, which, in my opinion, is a low rate. On this basis 9/10 ths of the available children were vaccinated last year. This very satisfactory result is attributed to the re-organiza- tion of 1871. 19. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vac- cinator for the whole Presidency is 1,652, or 146 more than the pre- ceding year. It was highest in Sindh and lowest in the Presidency and Southern Circles. 20. In the last 4 or 5 years, in at least a million of observa- tions, there has not been a single instance brought to light of syphilis having been communicated by vaccination ; nor has ever any such occurrence been known in the Bombay Presidency. 21. The suggestion of the Superintendent General of Vaccina- tion, that Government might avail itself of the services of the Medi- cal Officers of the Vaccination Department in the general sanitation of the country, might be made of great value. I would rather agree with the Superintendent General in maintaining the present number of Superintendents and allowing them to be Sanitary Officers for their own districts, believing as I do they must thus become a power for great good in the furtherance of this cause so greatly to be desir- ed. These officers, with their assistants, so constantly moving about in the districts and visiting thousands of villages, might certainly be, as the Army Sanitary Commission suggested, made useful for effi- rient inspecting service in helping towards the removal of local di- sease causes. The Bombay Vaccination Department partakes very much indeed of the character of what might be a most efficient sani- tary service for the Presidency ; and it appears to me that the Sanitary and Vaccination Department working together might, in a very short time, collect a fund of useful information, which would go far towards enabling this Government to take active sanitary steps when they may be able to do so. 22. Government will be glad to know that the Assistant Super- intendents have &quot; completely realized the expectations formed of them,&quot; and may be disposed to extend their usefulness in the mat- ter of sanitation so strongly advocated by the Army Sanitary Com- mission, as the Superintendent General reports this might be done without injuring their efficiency in their own branch, or adding much, if any, to the expenditure. 23. A new feature in this report is the carefully prepared details regarding the progress of vaccination in each zilha, which give the important points of the tabulated statements, and enables the general reader easily to apprehend the state and condition of vac-
5 cination in every part of this Presidency. These details show that the progress varies very much in different districts and circles. Thus in Sindh 42.1 per mille of population were primarily vaccinat- ed, while only 13.4 in the Presidency Circle, and 17.2 in the Southern Circle, were protected during the past year. 24. Considering the amount and the quality of the work shown in this report, I most cordially endorse the words of the Superintendent General regarding how much more it says in favour of the organization of the department, and for the energy of the Superintendents, their assistants and vaccinators, than words can do: and I beg to add, I am entirely satisfied with the work of the past year, and to commend the Superintendent General and Doctors Williams. Butler, Cody and Cola to the favourable notice of Govern- ment. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, (Signed) W. THOM, Surgeon General, Indian Medical Department.
REPORT ON VACCINATION THROUGHOUT THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY AND SINDH FOR THE YEAR 1873-74. Divisions of the report. This is the sixth report by the Superintendent General of Vaccination. It is divided into the usual parts, viz., 1st the general report, which is a summary of the work of the whole department, and in it the chief points of the circle superintendents' reports are noticed ; 2nd, extracts from the reports of superintendents, civil surgeons and dispensary officers and also several special reports on revaccination; and 3rd, the tables of returns showing the number of vaccinations in each circle; the cost of vaccination in each circle and for the whole department: the vaccinations at dispensaries, jails and in the army : also the number of vaccinated children inspected by superintendents and their assistants and the number of small-pox deaths in each registration circle. Alterations in the vaccine circles. 2. Before proceeding to show the work of the year it will be well to notice the changes which have taken place in the circles since last report was submitted. In the reorganization of the department which was made in 1871 there was a saving of some ten thousand rupees, which Government in their Resolution No. 1202 dated 3rd April 1873 ordered to be expended in improving the department, because they had pledged themselves not to effect a saving of provincial money at the expense of local funds. Accordingly, Dr. Turnbull when acting Superin- tendent General, drew up a scheme which was submitted to Government in his letter No. 378 dated 3rd June 1873 and finally approved by Govern- ment Resolution No. 2783 dated 7th August 1873, and brought into effect from the following November. The changes may briefly be expressed thus:( ii ) and added to the Central circle ; and 5th, Sáwantwadi state was taken from the Western circle and thrown into the Southern circle ; 6th, it was recom- mended that, after Dr. Butler vacates his dual appointment of civil surgeon of Rájkot and superintendent of vaccination, in the Western Gujaráth circle, the two appointments should be separated, and that there should be a superintendent for the Western Gujaráth circle, who shall have no other than vaccine duties to perform( iii ) Number.

( iv ) There are only six vaccinators in this Presidency paid by Government; they are 2 (civil) for Rájkot and Dísá and 4 (military) for the canton- ments of Púná, Mhow, Nímach and Nasirábád: all the others are paid from local funds, municipal funds and native states. From the above table it will be seen that there are 6 government, 48 municipal, 202 local funds' and 125 native states' vaccinators: total 381. There are 420 peons. Nearly all vaccinators have a peon, each assistant super- intendent has one, each superintendent has 4 and so also has the Super- intendent General 4. There are, as compared with 1872-73, exactly the same number of government vaccinators, 1 more local fund vaccinator, but 3 fewer municipal and 6 more native states : on the whole there is an increase of 4. At the end of the official year the Presidency circle estab- lishment of municipal vaccinators was increased by 5 at the cost of 6 peons who were reduced ; so there are now in Bombay city 16 vacci- nators and 5 peons. Just about the close of the year a municipal vaccinator was appointed for Dhárwád and one is to be appointed for Kárwár and another for Gulatgad. The municipal vaccinators for Bárá- mati and Khánápur were abolished in July and November and the Wálwá and Karhád municipal vaccinators were abolished at the end of the year. The increase of vaccinators in native states is owing to the Chief of Sánglí appointing a vaccinator in each of his districts of Shir- hattí and Mangalvedhá. The Chief of Miraj appointed a second vacci- nator for Lakshameshwar. H. H. Mír Alí Murád has appointed a second vaccinator and in Kutch there was an increase of two. Total number of persons vaccinated and revaccinated. 5. The number of persons vaccinated last year is more, in nearly all circles than in the year preceding, but the rate of increase differs a good deal in the different cir- cles, which I shall notice further on. The following figures show the number of persons who were vacci- nated and revaccinated in the year 1873-74 and the preceding one:( v ) I may at once say, there can be no doubt but that the increase is mainly due to the reorganization of 1871 having increased the number of vacci- nators and given to the department a most useful class of men, viz., the assistant superintendents, who constantly see that the vaccinators do their duty well. Excess of operations over the number of persons prima- rily vaccinated. 6. There were 7,733 operations more than the number of persons primarily vaccinated : that is to say, the vaccine operation was performed that number of times on persons who had been unsuccessfully operated on at least once before. Sex, caste, age and result. 7. The particulars as to sex, caste, and age are not recorded in revaccination cases nor in secondary operations ; there is thus the exact number of persons pri- marily vaccinated shown in the columns for sex, caste, and age under the heading of primary vaccination; but in the columns for result, both under primary vaccinations and revaccinations, secondary operations are entered, thus there are more operations than there are persons : this excess of opera- tions is shown in a foot-note to the Statements No. I. and V. and also for the native troops in No. VI.; but I am unable to give a similar foot-note for British troops, as I get a return which only shows the successful cases ; and for it I am indebted to the courtesy of Surgeon-Major Codrington, Secretary to the Surgeon-General, Bombay Command. Percentage of sex. 8. There were, exclusive of the European army returns, 329,865 males and 294,831 females primarily vaccinated. The proportion of the sexes in every hundred persons is therefore 52.8 and 47.2 respectively. The disparity is greatest in Bombay city where the males are 55 per cent. and it is lowest in the Western circle where they are 50.3. There has been a gradual decline in the excess of males over females during the past six years, with the exception of 1871-72. In 1866 the males exceeded females by 10 in every 100 persons, last year they exceeded by 5.6. This decrease in the disparity of the sexes is due to the super- intendents and their assistants impressing on the vaccinators that errors in respect to the sexes will be punished as severly as any other errors arising from carelessness. Castes. 9. As regards castes, exclusive of the European and native armies' re- turns, and taking the figures in Statements No. I. and V., there were christians 3,281, hindús 454,915, musalmáns 114,745, pársis 1,216, and other castes 44,874, or percentages of .53, 73.49, 18.53, .19 and 7.25 respec- tively. I am unable to say whether these percentages bear any close relation to the number of each caste in the general population, but there has not been much difference in these percentages for several years back. Age. 10. There has been a considerable annual increase in the number of in- fantile vaccinations during the past six years with the exception of 1870-71, but the percentage has rather fallen ; the following figures are for six years in civil life, viz. :( vi ) Years. Infantile vaccinations. Percentages. 1868 177,276 41.1 1869-70 191,221 41.8 1870-71 157,671 36.3 1871-72 174,522 34.5 1872-73 198,484 36.8 1873-74 235,543 38.0 Although there has been a very great increase in the number of infan- tile vaccinations since 1868, still it is evident that there has been a greater among children above one year old. This is doubtless due to the vaccinators endeavouring to leave as few unprotected behind them as possible. In a population of twenty-four and a half millions, it is probable that there are 678,462 children annually available for vaccina- tion ; but it takes the vaccinator, on an average, about two years to go over his charge, so that this reduces the infantile children to half the above sum : and again, in many parts of this presidency mothers strongly object to have children vaccinated under six months old, so that, in point of fact, it is really all but impossible to vaccinate within a year of birth, much more than a third of the available children. I think if we can reach 41 or 42 per cent. it will be doing very well. In Bombay city the percentage of infantile vaccination is as high as 65.3 and in Eastern Gujaráth circle it is 44.5, whereas in the Southern circle it is only 25.0 : which is a very strong indication that more vaccinators are required there. Percentage of success. 11. The percentage of success is, exclusive of the British army return, 94.8 in primary vaccine operations and 65.7 in revaccinations. The success in primary vacci- nations is 0.2 higher than last year, but it is not as high as it ought to be. If vaccinators would vaccinate always from arm-to-arm and with good lymph the success ought to be 99 per cent.; but unfortu- nately they cannot always get a child, to go from one village to another, with vesicles on the arms, and so they are often obliged to start work in villages from tube or glass-lymph, and as a matter of course there are always many of the first series unsuccessful. This matters all the more, that many parents object to a second operation after failure, though they willingly submitted their children to the first operation. The per- centage of success in revaccinations, I consider, is too high. It is difficult to fix an arbitrary standard of success in revaccinations, and most medical men even record differently ; thus one will register a success even though the vaccine vesicle has run its course to a pustule in 5 days; another considers that all the typical manifestations must be observed. I cannot believe that 65.7 per cent. of the revaccinations ran a perfect course, though there may have been more or less success in that number. The percentage of success varies a good deal in the different establishments as shown below :( vii ) The local fund vaccinators again stand highest and the native states are close on them. The success in dispensaries is low and it is still lower in the native army. This is- a matter of surprise to me ; but I cannot explain it, unless it be produced by there being few comparatively to vacci- nate and so good lymph cannot always be maintained in regiments. The following figures show the success in Statement No. 1, by circles. It will be observed that the success is highest in the Sindh circle in primary vaccination and lowest in the Presidency and Southern circles( viii ) account of the season. Now, this opinion is too general to be of much value; we certainly have more rain in the island of Bombay and the Konkan generally than in any part of the Eastern Gujaráth circle, though perhaps the heat there may be a little greater. During the hottest months there is a tendency to degeneration of the vaccine virus, but this can be easily met and prevented by 1st a little extra care in selecting the very best and most typical vesicles from which to take lymph : 2nd vac- cinating very carefully from arm-to-arm and 3rd selecting healthy and clean- skinned children to operate on. When I was superintendent in Sindh, I have seen many children, with the most perfect vesicles, when the hot wind was blowing in May and the thermometer at 110° in the shade. Even tube-lymph, if carefully selected and sealed, succeeds very fairly in the month of July( ix ) Whence received. Vaccine circle in which tested. Number of Character of vesicles. REMARKS.

Lymph was sent to the late Dr. Livingston by the mail of 7th October 1872, but what became of it 1 am unable to say. In February last, lymph was sent 2 vac
( x ) to the civil surgeon of Zanzibar. Supplies were repeatedly sent to officers in the Central Provinces and in short it was given to all applicants. Animal vaccination. 15. The practice of animal vaccination has been carried on in Bom- bay nearly the whole year and for a portion of the year in Poona and Bhooj and it will shortly be begun at Barsee. Dr. Williams does not say in his report whether it was continued at Sukkur or not. In Bombay cow-lymph is much esteemed and has overcome one great obstacle to vaccination and that was the unwillingness of parents to allow lymph to be taken from children's visicles. Population. 16. In 1871 I estimated the population of this Presidency with its subordinate native states at 21,000,000 : but the census which was taken in 1871 shows that my estimate was considerably under the real number. I am indebted to Dr. Lumsdaine for a &quot; proof copy &quot; of populations and areas which enables me now to form a correct judgment as to the progress of vaccination in every district; previously, I never could do more than hazard an opinion. Statement No. I. shows a population of 24,362,409 to which must be added about 123,220 for the military stations : this makes a total of 24,485,629, and if we add the civil population of the military stations of Mhow, Nímach and Nasirábád, from which we receive vaccination returns, the population in which we carry on vaccination, must be in round numbers about 24,500,000. Birth-rate taken at 30 per mille. 17. In the British territory of this Presidency there are now birth and death registers kept by village officers, but, it is perfectly certain that the registrars do not register anything like all the births. Hitherto I have usually reckoned the birth-rate at 30 per mille but I feel very great doubt about this being high enough. There is only one country in Europe, France, which has a lower birth-rate than 30 per mille. The most recent information which I can obtain shows that( xi ) There should be 678,462 children an- nually available for vaccination. the lower number of 30 per mille there should be in a population of 24,500,000 about 735,000 births per annum and if a thirteenth be deducted for still-born and those who die and get small-pox before the vaccinator can reach them, there should be 678,462 available for vaccination annually or only 52,544 more than were primarily vaccina- ted in the year under report ; so it will be observed that the annual increase in primary vaccinations cannot go on at the rate of the last few years, but a steady increase of revaccinations may be reasonably expected : and doubtless the annual increment to popula- tion will give a corresponding increase of births and consequently of vaccina- tions. Great increase in the number vaccina- ted annually in the last 20 years. 18. The increase in the number an- nually vaccinated and revaccinated is very marked in the last six years as the follow- ing figures show :( xii ) Circles.

Revaccination. 21. The Surgeon General, Indian Medical Department, in his letter No 3216 dated 13th September 1872 called the atten- tion of all the Deputy Surgeons General to the fol- lowing remarks which appeared in the &quot; Madras Monthly Journal of Medical Science &quot; for September 1872, regarding the results of revaccinations by the Surgeon of the Sappers and Miners in Bangalore:( xiii ) 3rd. The revaccinations should be performed by the surgeon of the re- giment or by a competent vaccinator. 4th. The result should be recorded by the medical officer of the regi- ment or jail himself. How far these instructions have been carried out I am unable to say, but I can say that the results were not always recorded by the medical officers themselves but sometimes entrusted to their subordinates. I have received only the returns of the operations in most cases without any report stating that these simple rules were observed or not. The reports from Deputy Surgeons Gene- ral Maitland and Johnstone are so interesting that I have added them to this report along with two special reports on revaccinations in Rajkot and Kár- wár jails by Surgeon Major Sexton and Surgeon Goldsmith. In the past year there were 2,585 revaccinations in the native army of which 1,182 were suc- cessful, 1,266 unsuccessful and in 137 cases the result was unknown. The percentage of success was 48.2. In the whole presidency there were 26,693 revaccinations, of which 14,894 were successful, 7,748 unsuccessful and in 4,051 the result was not ascertained. The percentage of success was 65.7. I would observe here that the army percentage of success is probably the more correct. I have in para. 11 pointed out how difficult it is to place a true value on the percentage of success as recorded by different persons in revaccinations. Cost. 22. The expenditure in 1873-74 was Rs. 2,16,076-8-4 or an increase of Rs. 5,281-7-5 over the preceding year which was caused by 1st the circumstance that for eight months of the year there were no acting officers drawing less than the full pay of the superior appointments and 2nd by the number of assistant superintendents and clerks having been increased since the 1st November. A still further increase of expenditure will occur in future from the second cause. The following figures show the sums expended by each establishment:( xiv ) The decrease in the municipal establishment was caused by the abolition of the vaccinators already mentioned in para. 4. The cost of each successful vaccination varies a good deal in the different establish- ments as shown below :( xv ) It will be observed that vaccination is dearest in Kutck, and I think it need not be so, were the establishment there properly organized. In Bombay vacci- nation must always be more expensive than in the other circles for many reasons. The cost in Aden was unnecessarily high because, by a mistake there were 2 vaccinators instead of only one( xvi ) Circle. Work tested by calling names from register. Present during inspection.

The assistant superintendents have been, with one or two excep- tions, reported as all that can be desired( xviii ) The 2 Government vaccinators' work. 26. There are only 2 Government vaccinators (civil). They opera- ted on 4,380 persons or 915 more than in the preceding year. They average 2,190 each. The 48 municipal vaccinators' work. 27. There were 48 municipal vaccinators or 3 less than in 1872-73. The vaccinators for Kaládgi, Bárámati and Khánápur having been abolished : the first from the beginning of the year, the second from July and the third from November. The Khánápur vaccinator was abolished for want of funds and the Bárámati one on the opening of a dispensary there. The Wálwá and Karhád municipal vaccinators ceased to exist on 1st April 1874. The municipal vaccinators operated on 59,116 which is 1,562 more than in the preceding year and gives an average of 1,231 for each vaccinator. The increase and decrease in circles is shown below: ( xix ) officer, although this is not a special peon still I think it will be sufficient. In Kulladghi and Dharwad there is a municipal vaccinator wherever there is a dispensary. All students are to qualify as vac- cinators before receiving a charge. 29. It has been arranged by the Surgeon General that the students of the Grant Medical College shall study vaccina- tion after passing their examinations and be- fore receiving charge of a dispensary. This is in obedience to the order in the Resolution quoted in the preceding para. The 202 local fund vaccinators' work, 30. The local fund establishment of vaccinators numbered 202 or one more than in 1872-73 ; the additional one was appointed to the Supa petha by Mr. Macdonald when small-pox was raging in it. They opera- ted on 368,053 or 50,537 more than in the preceding year. The average number for each vaccinator is 1,822. From the figures below, showing the increase by circles, it will be observed that the greatest increases took place in the Sindh and Southern circles( xx ) The decrease in the Western Gujaráth circle is of no sort of consequence as the vaccinations there are quite equal to the births; but the decrease in H. H. the Gaikawád's dominion is unfortunate: for there the vaccinations only reach 13 per mille of population when they might be double that number. No annual report of vaccination received from Baroda. 32. I receive from the Residency Surgeon at Barodá the usual annual returns of vaccination for H.H. the Gáika- wád's territory, but no annual report similar to &quot;what is received from the superintendents of other circles and from H.H. the Ráo of Kutch's medical officer. I am of opinion that an annual report should be furnished by the Barodá Residency medical officer for the purpose of showing this Government and H. M.'s Sec- retary of State for India the progress of vaccination in H. H. the Gáikawád's territory. Dr. Seward, who is the Residency Surgeon, has been good enough in a private note (which he has allowed me to make use of) to give me the following information which I give verbatim et literatim :( xxi ) The following scale of pay for the 11 vaccinators was introduced from 1st September 1873 :( xxii ) late Assistant Surgeon Bálkrishna Chintobá, who did the most vaccinations of any dispensary officer and practised animal vaccination at the Poona dispensary; Assistant Surgeon Mackenzie, Kumptá dispensary ; Honorary Surgeon Sinclair, Civil Hospital Kolhápur; Mr. Pollard, Dispensary Dápuli ; Mr. Narsú Guráppá, Dispensary Sholápur ; Assistant Surgeon Shántárám Vináyak Kantak, Godhrá dispensary; and Mr. Eskiel Isac, Larkháná dispen- sary. The increase and decrease is shown by cirles below :( xxiii ) circles : but Kutch circle is absurdly low and Barodá circle might easily be improved. The average number for each vaccinator can never be very high in the Presidency circle and I think the past year's average is very fair for it : ( xxiv ) the native army where all children should be vaccinated, and adults vaccinated or revaceinated. Small-pox in Sindh and Southern Circles. 41. Dr. Williams gives some interesting information regarding the in- troduction and stamping-out of small-pox in Sindh (vide page 4-5). Mr. Macdonald appoin- ted an extra vaccinator for the Supa petha to overcome small-pox there; and old and young flocked to the vaccinator who was aided very much by Mr. Ram Krishnapa the Mahalkari of Supa (vide page 18, para. 9). Inoculation. 42. It is reported that inoculators had been carrying on their baneful work in Wai táluká ; but I am unable to say to what extent they did so. 43. One of the Presidency circle vaccina- tors was permitted to accept an appointment of assistant superintendent of vaccination in the Berars. Govind Moray transferred to the Berars as an assistant superin- tendent. Vaccino-Syphilis. 44. It appears to be very generally admitted that the virus of syphilis may be communicated to a person along with the vaccine virus; but it can only be so by the vaccinator being so careless as to imply an utter neglect of the most ordinary observation and caution. The com- munication of syphilis by vaccination must be one of the very rarest occurrences in the world and the testimony of the officers of the Bom- bay Vaccination Department alone proves this to be the case. Not one of us has ever seen such a case and only one case has ever been even spoken of, and in that case Dr. Turnbull's enquiries proved conclusively that vaccination had nothing to do with the syphilis. During the past year the medical officers of the department inspected 92,976 vaccinated children and the worst things they saw were neglected sores and an abscess or two( xxv ) intendent. I have much pleasure in reporting that Surgeon Raby passed in Maráthí on 21st November last and Surgeon Major Turnbull in March last; Surgeon Williams, superintendent of the Sindh circle, passed the higher standard in Sindhi some years ago ; Dr. Colá in the Estern Gujaráth circle has not been required to pass, as Gujaráthi is his mother tongue (Government Resolution No. 555 dated 24th February 1874); Surgeon Cody, superinten- dent of the Western circle, has applied for a committee to examine him.* There only remains Surgeon Blomfield, acting superintendent in the Wes- tern Gujaráth circle, and he intends to pass in Gujaráthi, at the end of this rainy season. Inspection of vaccinated children. 47. During the year the superintendents inspected 92,976 vaccinated children in 2,369 villages or towns and the assistant superintendents inspected 217,269 vaccinated children in 10,745 villages or towns ; total inspected 310,245 vaccinated children in 13,114 villages or towns. We have no inspection returns from Presidency, Barodá and Kutch circles ;but as far as the Presidency circle is concerned, most of the vaccinated children are seen by the superintendent and the head vaccinator, so 11,814 should be added to the above total. I cannot say that there is any real inspection test in either of the native states of Barodá or Kutch: but the army vaccinations are seen by medical officers in charge of regiments and station staff, so that if we add the army returns we get a grand total of no less than 331,151 persons whose vaccinations were inspected. This is more than 50 per cent. of the total number of persons operated on, which is ample to test the quality of the vaccinations and the truthfulness of the returns. Tour. 48. I returned from England on the 5th August after a two years' furlough and took over charge from Dr. Turn- bull, (who acted for me during my leave,) on the 7th idem in Bombay. I went to Puná on the 18th and saw the vaccinators and their work there occasionally with the. superintendent of the Central circle during the rains and also the practice of animal vaccination as carried on by the late Assistant Surgeon .Bálkrishna Chin- tobá at the Khan Bahadur Pestonjee Sorabjeo Dispensary in Poona and I also saw the Hawelí táluká vaccinator's work, which was very good. In October I met Surgeon Cody, superintendent of the Western circle, at Tháná. and examined the work of the municipal vaccinator there and at Kolset bandar and also the vaccinations performed at the dispensary in Tháná.. On the 1st November I started on the regular tour. In company with Dr. Turnbull, the superintendent of the Central circle, I went through the zilhás of Puná, and .Ahmednagar, and with Surgeon Cody through Násik and Khándesh; then I turned south and marched through the zilhá of Sátára, Kolhápur state, the zilhás of Belgaum, Dhárwád and joined Surgeon Raby, the superintendent of the Southern circle in Kánada, and together we went nearly over the whole of this zilhá. I returned to Bombay from Kárwár on the 3rd April 1874. On my route I examined the birth, death and vaccination registers in villages and the office records of superintendents, assistant superintendents and the vaccinators' work as well as records. On the whole I was well satisfied with the work of the vaccinators and the state of their records. The vaccinators in Kanada had their registers in the old form which was corrected. He passed in Marathi on the 15th June 1874. 4 vac
( xxvi ) Truthfulness of returns. 49. The vaccination returns in British territory may be relied on as correct, or very nearly so( xxvii ) of this presidency as far as vaccination is concerned. In the following remarks, I shall be as brief as possible; but even if they be longer than I expect, I feel sure it will be easier for the general reader to have the impor- tant points laid before him, than for him to attempt to analyse the tables and figures for himself : and, what is of equal importance, my remarks on the different districts will give, in few words, the chief points for compari- son with the work to be shown in next report. Presidency circle. 53. The Presidency circle consists of Bombay city ; which has a popu- lation of 644,405 and an area of 19 square miles. For this circle there is a superinten- dent, Assistant Surgeon Anantá Chandrobá, G.G.M.C., who had 11 vaccinators and 11 peons under him, during the past year, but there are now 16 and 5 respectively. They primarily vaccinated 10,027 persons, of whom 8,665 were successful, 1,187 unsuccesful and in 446 the result was unknown. Of the unsuccessful, only 271 were operated on a second time. The success was thus only 87.9. The cow-lymph was lost during the months of July and August and vaccination was carried on by lymph in tubes received from the other circles. The great number of failures with this tube-lymph swelled the unsuccessful and has affected the percentage of success for the whole year. There were 3,880 revaccinated of whom 69 were operated on twice. The percentage of success was 53.5. The average number of persons operated on by each vaccinator was 1,264. The total number of persons operated on was 2,508 less than in the preced- ing year. Mr. Anantá Chandrobá attributes this decrease chiefly to the great number of children protected by small-pox in the epidemic of that year. The exact number of births in Bombay is probably not known to any one but I estimate it at 25 per mille. Bombay like all large cities has a large number of non-breeding men who have left their wives in their country- homes, consequently the birth-rate is low. The number of births is proba- bly about 16,000 and we might primarily vaccinate nearly 15,000 children per annum or just about 5,000 more than were primarily vaccinated last year. I estimate that there are probably 5,000 of the children born in 1873-74 left unprotected. With such an annual residue, there must inovi- tably be an epidemic of small-pox every few years ; especially as the disease is endemic in Bombay and is also constantly imported from the coast of Africa and the Persian Gulf. This cannot be considered satisfactory ; and what is even worse, I cannot promise myself much progress without a compulsory vaccination Act. I doubt very much if as large a proportion of children could be vaccinated in London, Liverpool or Manchester without a com- pulsory Act. At the end of the year, the number of vaccinators was in- creased from 11 to 16 and the peons diminished from 11 to 5, in the hope that more operators will be able to cover more of the city, and so still give further facilities to the people to obtain vaccination. There is now little or no trouble given to parents, for human-lymph is seldom used and a calf is taken to the very street where work is going on. The average cost of each successful vaccination is high (Rs. 1-1-3) as compared with the other circles; but this is unavoidable, even with a compulsory Act it will be high. Since writing the foregoing lines Dr. Weir, the Health Officer of Bombay Munici- pality, has been so good as to inform me that there were 15,665 deaths and 12,722 births registered in the calendar year 1873. If these figures be correct the inhabitants of Bombay city must be fast dying out: but I think it is more reasonable to say that the figures are not correct.
( xxviii ) Progress of vaccination in Cen- tral circle. 54. The Central circle now consists of the collectorates of Puná, Ah- madnagar, Sholápur, Sátárá and Ratnágiri and of the native states of Akalkot, Bhor, Jat, Atpadi and Phaltan. The population of the circle is 4,828,850 and the area is 27,656 square miles. There are 1 superin- tendent, Surgeon Major Turnbull, M.D., 5 assistant superintendents and 65 vaccinators. There were 121,541 persons operated on, the particulars of which will be given for each district of the circle. Puna collectorate. 55. The population of Púna collectorate is 878,785 and the area 5,095square miles. There were 1 assistant superin- tendent and 12 vaccinators, viz., 8 local fund and 4 municipal, and vaccination was carried on at 6 dispensaries. The total number of persons primarily vaccinated was, by the rural vaccinators 15,079 and 1,897 at dispensaries( xxix ) number of persons primarily vaccinated was 29,250 or 26.2 per mille of population. The success was 96.3 per cent. There were only 98 revaccina- lions. The progress here is very satisfactory. The reason of Sátárá zilha being so well vaccinated is that, in 1863 a number of municipal vaccinators were appointed to supplement the weak staff of Government vaccinators. The Honourable F. S. Chapman was then collector of the zilha and Mr. Plumptre was the superintendent of the Southern circle. That was the first step taken to have municipal vaccinators and the efforts of these two officers has borne good fruit: but after the appointment of a local fund vaccinator to each taluka it has been found unnecessary to keep up as many municipal vaccinators as at first. Ratnagiri Collectorate. 59. The Ratnágiri collectorate has a population of 1,019,136 and anarea of 3,789 square miles. There are 11 local fund vaccinators, and two dispensary officers carry on vaccination. There were 33,067 primarily vaccinated persons or 32.4 per mille of population. There were 1,465 revaccinations. For some years back the progress of vaccina- tion in this zilhá has been markedly ahead of all others. Deputy Surgeon General Johnstone was some years ago superintendent of vaccination in the Koukan Division, and I thought he might be able to account for the great progress of vaccination in this zilha, so I asked for his opinion. He seems to think that the efforts of Mr. Coles, who was collector, has had a considerable effect in bringing the practice of vaccination into esteem. I think Dr. Johnstone's own exertions must also have had some influence in the matter. Native states in Central circle. 60. The five native states of Akalkot, Bhor, Jat, Atpadi, and Phaltanhave a population of 381,938 and an area of 2,822 square miles. There are 5 vaccina- tors, that is one for each of the states ; but Bhor which is the largest is about to appoint a second, as one man is not equal to the charge of 111,689 souls spread over 875 square miles. The number of persons primarily vaccinated is 5,489 by the itinerant vaccinators and 231 at the Akalkot dispensary( xxx ) very unsatisfactory and I fear it must continue so until more vaccinators be appointed. I have just had a letter No. 641, dated 11th May 1874, from Mr. Grey in which he says &quot; the local and municipal funds of this district cannot &quot; bear any further charges for vaccination, and the proposal to appoint more &quot; vaccinators cannot be entertained.&quot; I leave it for Government to say whe- ther this shall be final or not. I will only add that, after having gone through this collectorate last cold season, I am thoroughly convinced more vac- cinators are necessary; but instead of getting more there is some talk of abo- lishing the Gokák municipal vaccinator : if this be carried out there will be only 9 vaccinators, each of whom will have an average population of 103,713 while the average for the whole presidency is about 64,300. These 9 vac- cinators would require to vaccinate an average of 2,872 children per annum to protect all, and last year the average in this zilhá was 1,501. Nothing I could say would demonstrate the necessity for an increase of vaccinators better than these figures do. Mr. Grey and his assistant collectors and dis- trict deputy collector all recognize the want, and have expressed their opinions that there should be, 4 vaccinators in Chikodi táluká and 2 in each of the ta- lukas of Athni, Sampgaon and Parsgarh, and I think there should be two rural vaccinators in each of the tálukás of Belgaum and Gokak, then the municipal vaccinator of Gokak would not be required. Mr. Grey says in his letter to me, No. 566 of 27th April 1874, para. 2( xxxi ) directed efforts of Mr. Robertson and his assistants will doubtless help the vaccinator to win his way to the affections even of lingayats. Kánadá collectorate. 64. The population of Kánadá is only 398,406 souls and the area is4,235 square miles. The district is partly below and partly above the Ghats. It is mostly covered with forest trees and is much broken by creeks, ravines and hills. There were 10 vaccinators employed during the year, and there were some vaccinations done at 9 dispensaries. The total number of primarily vaccinated persons was 14,855 or 37.2 per mille of population. The percentage of success was 92.0. There were 934 revaccinations. Each vaccinator on an average operated on 1,390 per- sons. The progress here is very satisfactory and is due in a great measure to the very active interest taken in vaccination by Mr. Macdonald, the collector. This zilha has repeatedly suffered from small-pox within the last few years. When Kánadá was transferred to this presidency in 1862, the late Dr. Stovell made enquiries into the state of vaccination in it, the results of which are printed in his report for 1872 at page IV. Vaccination was then in a very unsatisfactory state if not &quot;radically bad.&quot; Kaládgí collectorate. 65. In the Kaládgi collectorate the population is 816,037 and the area5,695 square miles. There were 10 vaccina- tors, 8 local fund and 2 municipal; in the previous year there were 3 municipal vaccina- tors for 10 months, but the Káládgi one was abolished in January 1873. There were 14,054 persons primarily vaccinated or 17.2 per mille of popula- tion. The percentage of success was 93.5. There were only 134 re-vac- cinations. There should be, I think, at least 3 more vaccinators in this zilhá; and until there be, I fear, the progress of vacccination cannot be as satisfactory as I wish it. Kolhápur, Southern Maráthá Country, and Sáwantwádi. 66. The population of the native states in the Southern circle is about1 ,621,227 and the area about 9,020. There are 25 vaccinators and 2 dispensaries and they pri- marily vaccinated 33,115 persons or 20.4 per mille of population. The success was 95.6 in Sáwantwádi, 87.4 in Southern Maráthá Country, and 96.5 in Kolhápur. There were 1,701 revaccinations. Each vaccinator averaged 1,339. There is room for extension here, which will doubtless follow the recent increase of vaccinators. Progress of vaccination in the Western circle. 67. The Western circle contains the collectorates of Tháná, Kolábá,Násik, and Khándesh and the native states of Janjirá, Jawar, and Penth. The popula- tion is 3,070,259 and the area 24,519. There are 6 assistant superintendents sanctioned but only 5 have been employed: there are 49 vaccinators and Surgeon Cody is the superintendent. There were 71,290 persons operated on. Tháná collectorate. 68. The collectorate of Tháná contains 847,424 of a population and is4,052 square miles in size. It has 13 vac- cinators, 11 local fund and 2 municipal: vac- cination is also practised at 9 dispensaries. There were 14,195 persons primarily vaccinated or 16.7 per mille of popu-
( xxxii ) lation. The percentage of success is 91.4. There were 178 revaccinations. The average vaccinations for each vaccinator is 1,040. Heavy rain and much sickness among the vaccinators caused a decrease of over 2,000 per- sons operated on as compared with the preceding year. Considering how long vaccination has been practised in this zilhá( xxxiii ) or 26.8 per mille of population. The success was 94.8. The revaccinations numbered 2,167. The average number of persons operated on by each vaccinator was 1,784. Kheda collectorate. 74. The population of Kheda collectorate is 782,733 and the area 1,561square miles. With the exception of the is- land of Bombay this is the most densely popu- lated district in Western India. There are 9 vaccinators` ( xxxiv ) pensaries. There were 29,307 persons primarily vaccinated or 25.8 per mille of population. The success was 94.7. There were 233 revaccinations. Vac- cination in these states is in a very satisfactory condition. Progress of vaccination in Wes- tern Gujaráth circle. 79. What is now the Western Gujaráth circle consists of the collec-torate of Ahmadábád, the province of Káthe- wád and Pálanpur territory. The population is 3,142,153 and the area 30,246. There is a superintendent, who is at present also civil surgeon of Rájkot; but a proposal has been submitted to the Government of India to have a superintendent for this circle, who shall have no other than vaccination duties to perform. There are 3 assistant superintendents and 52 vaccinators; and vaccination is practised to a very small extent at 11 dispensaries. There were 107,529 persons primarily vaccinated or 34.2 per mille of population. The percentage of success was 95.6. There were 3,725 revaccinations. The average number of persons operated on by each vaccinator was 2,090. Progress is very satisfactory and is very creditable to Dr. Butler. Ahmadábád collectorate. 80. The population of Ahmadábád collectoratc is 827,754 and the area3,841 square miles. It has 12 vaccinators( xxxv ) which, I think, must be more than the birth-rate : so it cannot be maintained long, as the arrears of unprotected must soon be all worked off. The success is 93.8 per cent. and the average number of persons operated on by each vaccinator is 2,339. Southern division of Káthewád. 85. The southern division of Káthewád contains 406,383 souls andhas an area of 3,693 square miles. It has 8 vaccinators and they primarily vaccinated 16,457 persons or 40.4 per mille of population There were 116 revaccinations. Each vaccinator operated on an average on 2,072 persons. I do not think these numbers can be maintained. Eastern division of Káthewád. 86. The eastern division of Káthewád has a population of 354,060and an area of 2,520 square miles. There are 8 vaccinators and at one dispensary 6 persons were vaccinated. The total number of per- sons primarily vaccinated was 17,049 or 48.1 per mille of population, which must be far above the rate annually available. There were only 140 revacci- nations. Each vaccinator operated on 2,148 persons on an average. Sindh circle. 87. The province of Sindh constitutes one circle( xxxvi ) lation. The success is 97.9 per cent. There are 4,005 revaccinations. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator is 2,485. Haidarábád collectorate. 90. The Haidarábád collectorate contains 721,947 of a population and9,052 square miles. There are 13 vaccinators( xxxvii ) mille of population. The percentage of success is 93.9. There are only 8 revaccinations. Each vaccinator's average is only 225. Vaccination is very backward here but I hope it will soon improve. Aden. 97. Aden has a population of 19,289 and an area of 12 square miles.By some mistake the Government station vac- cinator had been kept on since 1871 till near the close of the year : but there is now only the municipal vaccinator who is quite able to do all the work. There were 1,145 persons vaccinated or 59.3 per mille of population, but there were probably a number of those vaccinated only temporary residents, such as Somalis and other Africans and perhaps also some Arabs. The percentage of success is 80. There were 120 revaccinations. Each vaccinator's average is only 632. The success ought to be much higher. The vaccination department might assist the sanitary department. 98. The Army Sanitary Commission in reviewing my report for1870-71, stated that &quot; The returns show that &quot; the superintendents of seven out of ten circles &quot; visited and inspected 1,922 villages during &quot; last year and nevertheless so far as their &quot; special duties were concerned they appear to have had no function to per- &quot; form regarding local disease causes so extremely prevalent in Indian villa- &quot; ges and cities.&quot;This remark is not made with the object of taking exception to any &quot; portion of the vaccination organization or work. The facts already given &quot; show how efficiently this work is performed. &quot; The Commission are likewise too little acquainted with the local or- &quot; ganization of these villages to take upon themselves to make any recom- &quot; mendation on the subject. But seeing that the whole object of the vaccina- &quot; tion organization is to check the spread of one form of epidemic disease &quot; they would beg to suggest the question whether without in any way im- &quot; pairing the efficiency of the organization or interfering with its proper work, &quot; it might not render very efficient inspecting service in helping towards the &quot; removal of local disease causes ? The Commission make this suggestion be- &quot; cause, amongst other reasons, this Bombay Vaccination Department par- &quot; takes very much indeed of the character of what might be a most effi- &quot; cient sanitary service for the Presidency. It shows how in principle such &quot; a service should be organized, and it appears to be possible that the sani- &quot; tary inspecting work might be accomplished without an agency in duplicate &quot; which must necessarily partake very much of the character of the agency &quot; already in existence, while adding materially to the outlay.&quot; This was brought to the notice of this Government in Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India's letter No. 4 (Sanitary) dated India Office, London, 26th March 1872. I would beg to say that I believe the suggestion of the Army Sanitary Commission could be beneficially carried out without any considerable cost, indeed, it might be done without any additional ex- penditure at all. I know that it may be said that the officers of the vacci- nation department might devote too much of their time to sanitary matters in general and that vaccination in particular would suffer thereby: this is a danger that I do not fear, because for many years to come, in India, vac-
( xxxviii ) cination is likely to bring more credit to officers of the vaccination de- partment than general sanitation can be expected to give them, however successful they may be as sanitists. If Government should see fit to strengthen the sanitary department by the aid of the officers of this department, the present strength of superintendents is not too great; but on the other hand if Government wish to keep the two departments apart and distinct, then, some of the circle superintendents could be spared for other duties. With the assistant superintendents working so well as they have done, I think, we might extend their functions and place the whole presidency under the superintendence of 5 medical officers; that is to say, we should have only 5 circles, viz :EXTRACTS FROM THE REPORTS OF SUPERINTENDENTS OF CIRCLES.

Whenever and wherever we could, we did not hesitate to vaccinate little infants, hardly six or eight weeks old ; and never in these cases was there any thing untoward met with. As a matter of fact, with all these drawbacks, our work of the year under report, can bear comparison with the annual work for the last ten or twelve years, excepting, of course, the years 1871-72 and 1872-73, which were in every way exceptional, on account of the terrible prevalence of small-pox. Sex. Caste. Age. 2. Of the 10,027 primarily vaccinated, 5,515 were males, and 4,512 females, or respectively 55 and 45per cent. 844 were Christians, 6,394 Hindús, 1,256 Mahomedans, 665 Pársís, and868 of other castes3 and efficiency. Our vesicles, for the most part, when not disturbed, were of the true Jennerian type ; and the resulting cicatrices deep, well-marked, and foveated. Animal Vaccination. Our animal vaccination continues satisfactory. In all, 205 heifers were inocu- lated. In nine, only, did the operation fail. The following table shows the number of heifers inocu- lated in each of the twelve months, with the result of the operation :4 Registration districts. Sex. Caste. Age. Previously vaccinated.

Only 19 deaths were reported to have occurred in persons previously vaccinated. On enquiry, however, three or four of the 19 were found not to have had small-pox at all, but had died from fever. In three or four, small-pox came on simultaneously with vaccination, and ultimately proved fatal, of course, the patients must have been incubating the small-pox before they were vaccinated. Some were grown up people, and natives of other places ; and must have been vaccinated, if at all, out of Bombay. In two only, did we find' the names entered in our register ; and in both these the operation is reported as successful5 for the operation ; and in some instances a fear of offending the dreaded &quot; Devi &quot;* when actually present, or the fear of having to undergo certain trivial expenses which vanity usually prompts them to make,6 CENTRAL CIRCLE.

Lymph, vesicles and cica- trices. 4. The lymph in use throughout the year has been reported to be good and active, the vesicles large and characteristic, and the cicatrices deep and foveated. Inspection of vaccinators' work. 5. The vaccinators' work has been tested by the superintendent and assis- tant superintendents calling over the names of 78,006 children from the vaccinators' registers, of these 95.6 per cent. were returned by the vaccinators as successful vaccinations, but on inspection only 92.2 per cent. were found success- ful. On examining this number in detail I find that 75.5 per cent. were found to bear good vesicles or cicatrices, 13.2 middling and 3.5 bad. 6. As I have only been in charge of the circle from 8th March I have confined my remarks to these few words which are based on the figures of the present as compared with the previous year.* As returns for ten months only of the year have been received, it is not pos- sible for me to state exactly the results of the year's operations. I shall therefore, in the following report confine myself to the period from the 1st April 1873 to the 1st February 1874.* 2. I assumed charge of the circle from Surgeon Robb on the 12th August last, after I was relieved of the Acting Superintendent Generalship, on the return of Dr. Pinkerton from furlough, and am therefore personally acquainted with the workiug of the circle during the seven months preceding the 8th March 1873, the date of my giving over charge to Surgeon Gordon, and of my proceeding on privilege leave for three months. 3. Government were pleased, in their Resolution No. 2783 of the 7th August 1873, to approve of a scheme which I submitted when I was Acting Superin- tendent General for the re-distribution of the vaccine circles and ordered that the re-distribution should take effect from the 1st November 1873. This was done and as far as this circle is concerned, with the following result. Khándesh and Násik collectorates with the Penth state were transferred from the Central * Dr. Turnbull took three months' privilege leave on 8th March 1874, his report is therefore for ten months of the year. Dr. Gordon compiled the annual returns and wrote the preceding part of this Circle's report.
8 to the Western circle and the collectorate of Ratnágirí from the Western to the Central circle. The following statement shows the composition, area, &c., of the Central circle before and after the completion of the re-distribution :9 natural activity and to an easier worked district or the converse. As an instance of a good and active vaccinator doing, comparatively, a small number of opera- tions than in previous years, I may mention the man employed in the Wáí táluká, Sátárá zilhá, who has vaccinated only 1,428 persons or little more than half the number vaccinated in the previous year and certainly not half the average of a series of years. Small-pox had prevailed to a great extent during the previous year and had diminished the number of unprotected so very much that, in a con- siderable number of villages no subjects remained for operation. The cause and origin of this outbreak of small-pox was clearly the inoculator. At least two men were traced by the vaccinator and in one village the pátil had actually had his children inoculated. These matters were referred to the magistrate of Sátárá but no reply has yet been received. Sex. 6. Taking the returns of the past ten months, I find that 51.3 per cent. of the total vaccinated are males and 48.7 per cent. are females10 Success. 9. With regard to the result of the operations, I am glad to say, the returns are very fairly correct and that the percentage of success is higher than in the preceding year. In the majority of cases I have found the returns of the vaccinators very exact, but in a few, as will always be the case, I must say I had great reasons to be dis- satisfied and in none more so than in the case of the vaccinator of Siogáon táluká, Ahmadnagar collectorate, and that of Sirúr in Poona. The latter was the worst. The precentage of success in primary vaccinations as recorded by the vaccinators is 95.6 or 1.3 per cent. over the preceding year. With regard to the second and third columns under the head of &quot; Results &quot; I found some vaccinators very careless11 In Bársi, for instance, in a population of 18,560 about 8,000 belong to the above caste. The same way with Sholápur. Of a population of 53,403 nearly 15,000 are lingayat wanis, a people whose principal objection to vaccination, as far as I can ascertain, is caused by the dread of having to allow lymph to be taken from the arms of their children. The introduction of animal vaccination would completely overcome this objection. Irregularities in the progress of the vaccine disease. 11. In the town of Mahálungi in the Khed táluká, Pooná collectorate, a patil reported that his child had not only been vaccinated by force, but that it was very ill in consequence. Enquiry was at once made. Mr. Trimbak Anant, the assistant superintendent, proceeded to the spot and with the assistance of a panchayat investigated the case and found that the report was a tissue of misstatements. The child no doubt had been vaccinated, but with the consent of the mother. The disease had run its course normally and when seen (only a short time after the report was made) the child was in sound health and did not appear to have suffered in any unusual way. The whole matter was brought to the notice of the magistrate, Mr. Bell, who I believe fined the man. Such cases are not of frequent occurrence, but in every case strict investigation should be made and the results recorded. Mr. Trimbakráo in this case performed the duty in a very intelligent and satisfactory manner. Except badly or prematurely formed vesicles I have not seen anything unusual in their character during the past year. I have not seen nor heard of a single case in which disease other than cow-pox was introduced into the system through vaccination. Small-pox vaccination. 12. Though during the past four months I have tested the work of at least 30 vaccinators and called over the names of nearly 5,000 children, as they stood on the register, I have failed to discover a single death of a child from small-pox after successful vaccina- tion. In a case here and there I have seen a child who had suffered from small-pox after vaccination even when the cicatrices were distinct and regular. But such cases are &quot; few and far between&quot; and in all the small-pox disease had been mild. Small-pox. 13. The circle, as far as my information goes, has been almost entirely free from small-pox during the past year. In Ratnágiri one or two of the vaccinators reported a few cases but of very little importance. The other collectorates appear to have been com- paratively free from the disease. Inoculation. 14. Except from the Wái táluká, Sátárá zilha, no reports of the presence of the inoculator have been received. In the western part of the Wái district the inoculator had been at work. In nearly every village the vaccinator visited, he found numbers of children who had been inoculated, and in one case the pátil of the village had his own children inoculated and acknowledged the fact in writing. The reports of the vaccinator show that two men had been at work. Their names with the facts collected were referred to the magistrate of the district for inquiry and what pro- hibitory or other steps he might think fit. The subject is yet under investigation I believe. Conduct of the vaccinators and assistant superintendents. 15. Though I cannot report the conduct of the vaccinators as every thingthat can be desired12 torate. The remaining five have all been on duty throughout the year and have generally performed their duties most satisfactorily. For zeal, intelligence, and tact Messrs. Balkrishna Rájárám, Trimbak Anant, and Ràmji Khanderao have been distinguished and have in a very satisfactory manner seconded my efforts, and carried out my orders. They have all worked hard and done what they could to promote good vaccination and to extend the prophylactic wherever it was found backward or deficient. In testing returns, preserving and distributing good lymph and generally in raising the status of the vaccinators they have performed their duties in a very praiseworthy manner. It was at first thought that sudden eleva- tion from small to comparatively large pay might tend to make these men rather harsh in their bearing towards those under them. That such has not been the case in any of the assistant superintendents of this circle I feel perfectly sure. They have acted in all cases with patience, kindness, and forbearance, yet with firmness. They have been thoroughly truthful, honest and straightforward; not scrupling to bring to notice even the smallest mistakes of the vaccinators, but not forgetting to mention their good qualities also. I have had frequent opportunities of personally testing the truthfulness and exactness of their reports and have never found them otherwise than correct. Tour. 16. On the 1st April 1873 the office was in Khándesh and thence Dr. Robb proceeded through the Násik district in the following month. In October I examined a few villages in Haweli táluká and on the 3rd November proceeded through Haweli and Sirur tálukás to the Ahmadnágar district in company with the Superintendent General. Work of the Haweli vaccinator excellent, that of the Sirur vaccinator the very reverse. From Sirur we went through the Párner táluká to Nagar. In Párner the work was good but very small in amount, and as a large number of villages remained unvisited and the vaccinator was and had been conducting himself very irregularly, I asked the Superintendent General to remove him, which was done and the municipal vaccinator of Ahmadnagar appointed in his place. At Nagar we inspected the work of the táluká and municipal vaccinators and found it very satisfactory. From Nagar we went to the Newasa taluka and thence to the Siogaon taluka. In the latter vaccination was not pro- gressing satisfactorily and as the vaccinator wished to resign his appointment, he was discharged. In Newásá Vithu Bhikáji was doing very fair work but not going over his district so regularly as is desirable. This fault is not a very rare one and the wonder is that it is not more frequent, for the men are without maps. Every vaccinator should be supplied with a map of his district. Without them they can not be expected to go over the villages regularly. From Newásá I proceeded through the tálukás of Rahuri, Kopargaon and Sangamner. In Rahuri everything was satisfactory. When in this táluká I tested lymph re- ceived from England through the Superintendent General of Vaccination. It resulted successfully and was propagated and distributed in tubes throughout the circle and to several medical officers beyond the circle limits. In Kopargaon taluka matters were not so satisfactory, but the fault was not entirely the vaccinator's. In many villages the village officers (I know from personal experience) give less assistance than elsewhere. The work of the vaccinator was middling and his lymph inferior. He was at once ordered to discontinue the latter and was sup- plied afresh from the Rahuri táluká. In Sangamner táluká the vaccinator was actively and successfully pursuing his duties, but had difficulties to contend with 13 pensaries and report the result for the information of the superintendent. The Surgeon General Indian Medical Department has since issued instructions on this point. From Sangamner I proceeded to Narayangaon in the Juner táluká, which has always been the worst vaccinated district in this circle notwithstanding the waste of much valuable time in almost vain endeavours to overcome the prejudices of the people. In the Juner táluká I visited 16 villages and personally explained the objects and benefits of vaccination to the village officers and people. I also visited and inspected the town and dispensary of Juner. Vaccination had been well kept up by the native doctor in charge, Mr. Babaji Jadhao. From Juner I went to the Khed táluká inspecting the work of the local fund and municipal vaccinators. The former was well done but the latter was only fairly so. However he has many difficulties to contend with, specially in the towns of Khed and Penth. From Khed I went to Madhe and Karmala tálukás where [ found the work moderately satisfactory. Thence I went to Bársi, examined the dispensary, the work of the municipal vaccinator and had an interview with the members of the municipal committee to consider the best means of promoting vaccination among certain classes of the people who have hitherto not accepted its benefits. The lingáyat wanis, of whom there are 8,000 in Barsi, are very difficult to manage. They object to vaccination but more especially to allowing lymph to be taken from the vaccinated child's arm. One member of the municipal committee him- self a lingayat wani informed me that this was the principal objection his fellow- casteman had to the operation ; that he thought they had no strong or deep-rooted objection to it otherwise and that were this difficulty removed he thought many would submit their children for vaccination. I suggested the introduction of animal vaccination as a means of meeting the difficulty and proposed to do so pro- vided the municipality would defray the extra expense. I explained very fully the process and its advantages and after dispelling their imaginary fears as to pain inflicted on the calf, they agreed unanimously to bring the matter be- fore the next general meeting of the municipal committee, and they thought no difficulty would be experienced in providing the funds. From Bársi I went to Sholápur and inspected the work of the municipal vaccinator and the charitable dispensary. Both were satisfactory ; but here, as at Barsi, the lingayat wanis muster in large number14 but then he prevaricated so much I could not rely on a single word he said. I was obliged to bring these and other matters to the notice of the political agent. In my report for 1872-73 as Acting Superintendent General of Vaccination I made a few remarks on the necessity for employing an additional vaccinator in the Bhor state. Since I re-assumed charge of this circle I have submitted through the political agent a detailed statement of what I propose should be done. I hope the scheme will be carried out. From Bhor I went via Jejuri to Saswad and inspected the work of the Pu- randhar taluka vaccinator and the Jejuri and Saswad dispensary medical officers en route. The vaccinator I found working steadily and successfully. As also that at Saswad some vaccination work had been done. But at Jejuri no work what- ever had been done and the hospital assistant was unable to do any. From Saswad I went to Poona, for the purpose of undergoing an examination in the Marathi language. Having passed successfully I proceeded on the 3rd March to visit the Mawal taluka and thence on the 8th I proceeded on three months' privi- lege leave. During four months I inspected the whole of the Ahmadnagar and Poona collectorates, a considerable portion of Sholapur and the Malsiras and Wai talu- kas of Satara with the native States of Bhor and Phaltan. I travelled 1,091 miles, visited 202 villages, and inspected 4,863 vaccinated children, the work of about 25 vaccinators and 8 dispensary medical officers.
15 SOUTHERN CIRCLE. Superintendent.16 average cost of each successful case. There is however still room for improvement in the percentage of successful cases as well as in other respects. Total operations. 3. The total number of persons primarily vaccinated, exclusive of dispensa- ries, is 90,780 and of re-vaccinations 2,266. The num- ber successfully vaccinated of the former is 79,683 giving a percentage of success of 91.8 ; of the re-vaccinations the number success- ful is 1,291 which gives a percentage of 61.0. Dispensaries. 4. Of the dispensary vaccinations, the total number of persons primarily vaccinated is 2,637 ; of successful 2,365, giving a per- centage of success of 89.8. The total number of persons re-vaccinated is 965, 346 of whom are reported successful17 difficult to see how the case can be satisfactorily met, except as the collector sug- gests, by the vaccinator taking the signatures of some influential persons in the village certifying to his having been present at such a time ; but in small, out of the way, villages, where not only the patil, but, all the villagers are antagon- istic, this course is hardly feasible. The only plan that I see is to repeatedly call on the patils by sending them notices on certain days when the vaccinator has lymph, but this of course greatly delays work and the vaccinator loses his lymph. In the Belgaum taluka the vaccinator, Shaik Kadar, has vac- cinated 2,284 persons. In the Chikodi taluka the two vaccinators have ope- rated on 3,608 persons, nearly doubling their number of the previous year : but in both these talukas there are many villages left unvisited which the vaccinators have been unable to reach. Compared with the previous year all these vaccina- tors, with the exception of Gokak and Bidi, have improved their numbers. , The Parasgarh vaccinator was fined by the Superintendent General for having so many unknown and unsuccessful in his return, he hus been doing better since. In the Sampgaon taluka during my tour I found some persons in villages endeavouring to obstruct the vaccinator by representing to the people that vac- cination is useless, and that bad effects might follow it. It was useless speaking to the men, so I reported the matter to Mr. Stewart, the first assistant collector, who stated he could do nothing but caution them. In other villages the patil refused to be present or to aid the vaccinator; these cases Mr. Stewart took cognizance of by inflicting small fines which however proved a sufficiently strong measure to induce them to be more attentive in future, and smoothed the way for the vaccinator. Progress in Kaladgi zilha. 7. In the Kaladgi collectorate there is an increase of 3,869 persons vacci- nated, the total number being for the year 14,188. Of these 12,165 are successful. That this, however satisfactory it may be in the way of an improvement, is what it should be, I am far from admitting, and in future years, I hope to see a still further increase. Compared with the preceding year all the vaccinators have increased their opera- tions ; particularly worthy of notice is the .Badami vaccinator. In this taluka, it must be noted, however, there are less difficulties to be overcome than in many others, such as Mudibihal, Hunugund. and Bagewadi where a. vaccinator has only been permanently located, since Dr. Pinkerton's re-organization of the department in 1871. One or two vaccinators of this zilha are moreover reported inefficient by the assistant superintendent on account of want of education and tact. A municipal vaccinator has been sanctioned for Gulalgad and the surrounding villages (Badami taluka) some time since, but though I have repeatedly written for information as to the pay, &c., of the vaccinator. none has hitherto been re- ceived, so that the appointment has not yet been filled up. Progress in Dharwad zilha. 8. In the Dharwad collectorate I have likewise an increase of 3,209 over the previous year to exhibit, but this falls far short of what it ought to be. In reviewing the operations of this zilha, I am bound to state that the vaccinators have no ordinary amount of opposition to contend with and Mr. Robertson, the collector, states that in some parts the people will not accept vaccination in any shape or form, and the collector's influence in the matter of vaccination, whatever it may be in other affairs, appears insufficient to effectually spread vaccination in some of the tálukás. Notably is this the case in the tálukás of Ron, Dambal, Ranibednur and some parts of Kod and Karajghi, in the three former vaccination makes little or no real head. This is, in my opinion, in a very small degree, if any, attributable to want of energy or tact on the part of the vaccinators ; I can say so because I am personally well acquainted with them ; some of them have done plenty of work in other tálukás. I have also been informed by the 1st assistant collector in reply to numerous reports which I have forwarded for investigation, that the people are very ignorant and refuse to have their children vaccinated. Whether such an excuse is valid or not I leave to others to say but I may compare the progress vaccination 3 VAC
18 has made in one taluka of the Dharwad district, viz., Hangal taluka, where a late district officer, Mr. Middleton, I know interested himself with the state and progress of vaccination in Ron and Dambal. The vaccinator of Hangal, Man- narswami, has this year vaccinated 2,706 persons. He was the previous year in the Ron táluká where he did only 231 vaccinations. This year in Ron the vaccinator, Girmalappa, has vaccinated 695, an increase certainly, but very little really. In the Hangal táluká, Mr. Middleton, as I myself am aware, fined some village officers who neglected to aid the vaccinator and warned others. The consequence was, as I personally saw, that as a rule the vaccinator had no difficulty whatever worthy of mentioning. Mr. Stewart has followed a similar course with the most beneficial results and the mamlutdar, Mr. Gururao Raghvend. gives active and ready assistance at all times. I wish I could say as much with regard to the mamlutdars of Ron and Dambal, viz., Messrs. Bhagwant Rao and Bittu bin Maji. Mr. Robertson, however, disapproves of these measures, I believe, and though he informed me in October last, that he had issued strict orders to the mamlutdars, that all cases of neglect on the part of village officers should be severely dealt with, yet when I visited the Dharwad district, more than once I had occasion to report village officers for neglect. and inattention to my own notices to collect vaccinated persons for inspection and to bring their registers to my camp for inspection and signature ; very little notice, if any, appears to have been taken of such conduct, nor have I as yet19 remissness also. I am however not at all pleased with the way in which this assis- tant superintendent has conducted his duties, but I think from the way in which Dr. Pinkerton spoke to him about his neglect, he will probably do better in future. Kisansing Kaluram of the Halial táluká has given me much trouble and I have more than once had occasion to fine him. He is always late with his returns, and always ready with some frivolous excuse in extenuation, besides, he does not work regularly through his táluká. I have warned him more than once and deferred the question of his dismissal till I should see him which since the close of the year I have done, and find him careless and inattentive to most of the circulars I have issued with no valid excuse whatever. He has promised faithfully to amend which I have no doubt he can do if he likes. Native states. 10. It is a pleasing feature in this report to note the steady improvement in the vaccination of native states and the appointment of vaccinators for outlying districts. Last year the appointment by the Chiefs of Jamkhandi and Miraj of vaccinators to their districts of Kundegal and Lakshameshwar in the Dharwad district has been followed this year by the Chief of Sangli appointing vaccinators for his district of Shirhati in the Dharwad collectorate and Mangalveda bordering on the Kaladgi and Sholapur collectorates. These new vaccinators have done very little work, probably on account of being fresh to the work, and the people among whom they are employed being ignorant of the benefits of vaccination. The total number of persons vacci- nated during 1873-74, is 34,816.* The increase in the native states vaccinations compared with 1872-73, is 2,150*. Speaking personally of these native states' districts I found very much less difficulty in collecting vaccinated children for inspection than in our own districts. At the commencement of the year I ar- rived from England and in April travelled to Baura to enquire into some reported falsifications in the returns of the vaccinator which were discovered by Assistant- Superintendent Dattu Balappa, who has since been transferred from Kolhapur to Kaladgi. I investigated this matter in several villages and finding many false names dismissed the vaccinator. A new assistant superintendent was selected from among the Kolhapur vaccinators and appointed in September last. He is some- what new to the work, but is an active and intelligent young man whom the Su- perintendent General has seen and approved of. Municipal vaccination. 11.Though there appears from statement No. III to be 7 municipalities vac- cinators in this circle yet six only have been effective throughout the year, the Dharwad municipal appoint- ment having been created only at the end of the official year. The appointment of a vaccinator for Dharwad was in no small degree brought, about by my direction to the táluká vaccinator in December last to discontinue his operations in the town of Dharwad. He had been continuously working there for 9 months to the neglect of the taluka in his charge. This appears to have stirred up the residents of Dhar- wad who would seem to have considered they had an undisputed right to the every day services of the vaccinator Shortly afterwards a case of small-pox occurred, and the vaccinator was ordered back for a time, but the necessity of a permanent station vaccinator was thus rendered apparent. A municipal vaccinator is likewise to be appointed to Gulatgad of the Badami táluká. All the municipal vaccinators with the exception of Hubli have increased their operations20 Age. ble more generally to vaccinate infants. This point has been more than once during the year brought to the notice of the vaccinators, who state that the mass of the people have an insuperable objection to submit very young children. I have paid considerable attention to this subject, on my tour, and have endeavoured to procure, on my visit to villages, young children for operations whenever there was fresh lymph, but the people as a rule certainly do object. Sex caste. 13. The proportion of males to females taking the grand total of the persons primarily vaccinated is 52.2 to 47.8. The percentages of castes is Christian .6, Hindus 87.1, Musalman 7.2, Parsis none and other castes 4.9. Lymph. 14. The lymph in use during the year has been generally reported good, and that I have inspected on tour, with few excep- tions, has been satisfactory. Some of the men have occasionally lost their lymph, which, has cost much trouble and inconvenience in its renewal, more so especially as no tubes have been forthcoming for some months, the supply in Bombay having become exhausted. Fresh lymph has been received from England through the Superintendent General and spread through some talukas, but it has not been so generally for want of tubes. Lymph has also been supplied to civil surgeons, dispensary officers and others. Small-pox. 15. Small-pox has been more or less prevalent throughout the circle, espe- cially in some parts of the Kanada collectorate, in the Karwar and Bhatkal talukas where the assistant superintendent was engaged for some months in 1873 endeavouring to stop its ravages, but the people were very reluctant to have their children vaccinated. In some cases assigning as a reason the prevalence of small-pox, in others the reverse, which can only be regarded as frivolous excuses for avoiding the opera- tion altogether. The Bhatkal and Karwar taluka vaccinators have both how- ever been dismissed during the year for inefficiency. At Karwar small-pox has been prevalent almost every month throughout the year; its prevalence there has been attributed by the civil surgeon to the proximity of Goa, whence the disease is introducted by the Goanese coolies who are mostly unvaccinated. The type of disease has been a fatal one and it has, no doubt, in Karwar and the surround- ing villages found a fertile field. There seems to have been some misunderstand- ing as to whom these villages belong, i.e., the taluka vaccinator or the dispen- sary officer who is also a municipal officer, specially paid for vaccinating in the municipal villages, but he has taken charge of these villages without really being able to attend to them as they ought to be attended to, as far as vaccination is concerned. A separate municipal vaccinator will shortly be appointed so that, such a state of affairs will not rccur, and in the meantime the taluka vaccinator is working in these villages, which I personally visited and had the promise of hearty co-operation on the part of the village officers henceforth, whom I particularly im- pressed with the nccessity of not allowing a single person to remain unvac- ciuated. This has had already an excellent effect, due more probably to the active assistance of the collector and Mr. Ingle than to any efforts of mine. In the Bankapur taluka I found small-pox prevalent in a village on my visit, no report of which had been made to the mamledar by the village officer. I had lymph with me and vaccinated several children and subsequently sent the vaccinator to the village. Assistant superintendents. 16. During the year I have seen all the assistant superintendents of this circle. The Belgaum assistant superintendent, Balwantrao, is a new man who was transferred from the Central circle and promises well. The Kaladgi assistant superintendent, Dattu Balappa, was transferred from Kolhapur. I found him of much assistance during the year in the way of explaining to some of the vaccinators the nature of their duties, and checking many irregularities. These assistant superintendents can render
21 the superintendent the greatest useful assistance not only in inspecting vaccinators' lymph and general work, but in seeing, on their repeated visits to each vaccinator, that they are working regularly through their charge instead of skipping from place to place and residing too long in one place. Regarding the Kanada assistant superintendent, Dhankoti Dasrathi, I have previously referred to him but may state again that I have not found him as active or attentive to directions as he should be. I have had occasion to severely reprimand him and he has been fined heavily by the Superintendent General. The Dharwad assist- ant superintendent, Swamirao Rango, accompanied me for nearly two months in his district, and I examined much of his old inspections which I found fairly correct. He is not as active or quick in his inspections, in detecting inaccuracies in returns, as I think a good assistant superintendent should be, and does not appear to have that amount of tact which is desirable. The selection of assistant superintendents in this circle from among the vaccinators will not in future be difficult, as there are three men in the Dharwad zilla alone who would probably make good assistant superintendents. These are Mannarswami, Girmalapa Virappa, and Shaik Budan, though I should give a decided preference to the first named, who was not promoted before, on account of his being so short a time in the department. False entries. 17. It is very rare that any false entries in returns are brought to light now that the vaccinators' registers are subject to such close scrutiny. None have been reported during the year22 all the states permanent peons have been granted at salaries ranging from Rs. 5 to Rs. 7. On the whole the response of the Chiefs has been satisfactory and en- couraging. The Miraj vaccinators (senior branch) are paid rather low, Rs. 12 and 10 per mensem. As one of these men has been in the department many years I regret that the Chief did not see fit to allow him some little extra reward for his services. Inoculation. No reports of the practice of inoculation have been made to me during the year. Tour. 20. As regards my tour there is little more to add to what I have already mentioned in the different paragraphs referring to collectorates and native states. The particulars will be observed in statement No. VII. I may merely state that in March 1873, near the end of the official year, I resumed charge from Surgeon-Major Lewis. I shortly after travelled to the Kolhapur district. I returned to Belgaum for the monsoon, after which, in November, I was detained three weeks near Belgaum, waiting for an examination committee to examine me in Mahrathi ; which I passed. This pre- vented my going over all the talukas of the Dharwad collectorate as I had intend- ed, however I managed to see all the vaccinators about their returns, books, &c. Most of my attention has been devoted to Kanada. To sum up briefly I may state that during the year I have visited and inspected 246 towns and villages, inspected 9,738 vaccinated children23 The only two assistant. superintendents that can be advantageously compared with the previous year are the Dharwad and North Kanada.24 WESTERN CIRCLE. Superintendent.25 Cause of decrease in the Thânâ collectorate. Increase in native states. Increase in municipalities. Increase at dispensaries. and taken together with a great and an undue amount of sickness amongst the vaccinators, prolonged even into November and December, fully accounts for the small outturn of work during those months. This latter cause more particularly, very seriously militated against a progress that was otherwise to be expected in the Tháná collectorate, and by means of it, the steady advance made in the other districts constituting this circle, is somewhat overshadowed. The increase in thenative states amounts to 3,037 and is general, in vary- ing proportions amongst the three states.. The largest increase took place in Janjirá, viz. 1618, and is chiefly attributable to the lively interest taken in vaccination by the Assistant Political Agent, Mr. Larcom. The progress made in Jawár and Penth too is considerable, and is chiefly due to the fact of the vaccinators' operations being uninterrupted throughout the year. Un- der the municipal establishment the increase amounts to 46. There are fourmunicipal vaccinators and they vaccinated 2,642. This is a small outturn for 4 men, but it must be re- membered that they have much to contend with in the larger towns. The dis- pensary returns show an advance too on last year, which though small, may be taken as some slight in- dication of a growing popularity for these institutions as vaccination centres. Average number of vaccina- tions performed by each vacci- nator. 3. The average number of operations performed by each vaccinator amounted to 1,407. Taking the establishments in detail, the range of the average is very considerable, as may be seen from the returns. At present I shall only allude to the different districts in which operations have been carried on and give the average outturn of work of the men employed in them. Thus in Tháná collectorate the average of the local fund and municipal vaccinators is 1,040, in Kolábá 1,575, in Nasik 1,386, and in Khándesh 1,547. The averages approximate pretty well in Kolábá, Násik and Khándesh and range fairly high, while in Tháná from causes before alluded to the reverse obtains. The ave- rage amongst the three native states vaccinators is 2,005. The largest number of operations was performed by the Janjirá vaccinator, Náráyan Shankar Joshi, viz. 3,057, and the smallest, 349, by the Tháná municipal vaccinator. Vithu Rághu. I refer here to the number of operations rather than to the number of persons, as the latter does not give a proper estimate of the time and labour expended, from the fact of many persons having to be treated more than once. The reasons for this very wide divergence are obvious. On the one hand we have a very tractable people, easily managed, and ready to avail themselves of the advantages held out for their acceptance, by the vaccinator; and on the other there is the converse of all this. Amongst the local fund vaccinators the largest number of operations falls to the lot of the Virdal vaccinator, Nánáji Lakshaman, and the smallest to the Rohá vaccinator Ráoji, Chimnáji. In explanation of the small amount of work by this latter, I must say that he has not been employed throughout the year, but was entertained during the last six months to replace an old vaccinator, Bábáji Vithal26 Caste. ther sex to the vaccinator, and can only say that the proportions, as given, must be tolerably correct, from the amount of scrutiny the vaccinators' returns are now submitted to. Examining these numbers as to caste, it will be found that a per- centage of 88.8 are hindus, next come the outcastes who range at 6.8 per cent, next the musalmans 3.4, then the Christians 0.8 and lastly parsis who bear a proportion of about .005 percent to the total. From want of any detailed information regarding the rela- tive proportions these different races bear in the total population, I am unable to state with accuracy the relative popularity for vaccination these percentages may exhibit. Casual observation however leads me to the conclusion that they give a pretty fair idea of the relative extent to which vaccination is now received by the different castes; and I doubt much if I could show a more proportionate popula- rity for it amongst the musalmans and parsis even if I had exact figures at my disposal. There is a very considerable musalman population occupying the larger towns in this circle, more particularly the busy ports of Tháná and Kolábá, but I find as a rule the vaccinators meet such an amount of opposition amongst them that, they rather avoid the contest, and carry on their operations among the more tractable hindus. The native Christian population met with in this circle is most- ly confined to the two tálukás of Salsette and Bassein, where nearly all the sub- jects of this creed, shown on the returns, were operated upon. They exhibited a good deal of opposition in Salsette, and the vaccinator of that district reported to me, more than once, difficulties he met with in Christian villages. However there is a slight advance over last year in the number of Christians. 5. A great deal of the success of vaccination, as a prophylactic, depends upon the age of the subject to which it is exhibited ; and bearing this in mind, I have always endeavoured to fully impress on my assistant superintendents and vaccinators. how much the ultimate good of their operations will be enhanced by being carried on amongst infants of a tender age. A good many of them are ful- ly impressed with this, but then the opposition they meet with in obtaining infants to treat, renders nugatory to some extent their efforts in this respect. The people are loathe to permit of their children being vaccinated until such time as they are able to run about and partly take care of themselves; believing that, at this age they are better able to endure the operation than when infants in arms. This is a serious mistake and one that cannot be too frequently dilated upon. In the first place the child of poor parents at the running about stage has very little care bes- towed upon it; and when vaccinated, is not prevented from scratching the vesicle, when it becomes irritable, thereby preventing it from running its natural course to maturity, to the material detriment of its protective powers. And again the fever of maturation seems to affect, with much greater force, children of this age than it does infants in arms, who bear the infection with the vaccine virus with wonder- fully little disturbance. In infants the vesicle is seldom hindered from running its full course to maturity, principally because of their inability to either scratch or tear it open, and so its value both as lymph giver and protective agent is consi- derably enhanced. The former object speaks for itself, but regarding the latter I would here beg permission for a few observations in explanation of what I mean. A vaccine vesicle which, having reached maturity, is left unbroken and allowed to dry up or more technically to scab, permits of, during the process, much of the lymph it contains being absorbed into the system, and so its protective value becomes greater in consequence of this re-absorption, which takes back portion of the outpoured virus again into the circulation. When this fact is considered it will be readily understood, how necessary it is, that strong efforts should be made to ensure vaccination being carried on, when the subject is of such a tender age as will guarantee the vesicles being left intact; and having said so much, I now proceed to show what progress has been made in this circle in carrying out infantile operations during the past year. Age. 6. Of the total number of 68,399 persons primarily vaccinated 25,552 were under one year old and 42,847 were over one year or percentages 37.3 and 62.7 respectively. This is the
27 ratio which pertains in a combination of the returns from all the districts ; but if they be taken in detail it will be found that some districts are far in advance of others in this respect. Thus in the Tháná collectorate the precentage of opera- tions on subjects under one year is 40.7, and that in subjects over one year 59.3. In the Kolábá collectorate there is an improvement on this ; for here the percentage under one year is 51.5 while that over one year is 48.5. The Násik collectorate as regards infantile operations is but a shade better than the general result for the whole circle, for here the subjects under one year numbered 38.7 percentum while those over one year were 61.3. In Khándesh the percentage under one year is 35.3, and over one year 64.7. In the native states, matters, in this respect, are not so satisfactory, but this may be accounted for by the amount of leeway to be made up, as vaccination in them, is a thing of recent introduction. The percentages of the three states taken together stand at under one year 16.5 and over one year 83.5. Contrasting these results with similar ones attained in 1872-73 as taken from the published report I have to show an advance in all the districts with the exception of Khándesh. Result. 7. The result obtained in primary vaccinations gives a percentage of success of 93.7 and that in re-vaccination 67.5. The former is not so good as I would wish ; and I think a good deal of this low rate is to be attributed to the failures which occur amongst persons who ought rather to appear in the re-vaccination columns than in the pri- mary. Grown up children may have had slight attacks of small-pox and the fact easily escape the notice of the vaccinator at the time of his operating ; and so, while from the previous invasion of the natural disease they are rendered imper- vious to the action of vaccination, they are shown on the returns as failures of it. Lymph, vesicles and ci- catrices. 8. The lymph in use throughout the year was generally good and active, and these qualifications regarding it I have had fre- quent opportunities of personally ascertaining, and have received many reports, testifying to the same, from the assistant superintendents. It absolutely failed but in one instance, and that was in the hands of the Bhosawal vaccinator, Ganesh Somnáth. In the south-eastern extremity of the táluká, I came on two villages on the 7th day after the vaccinator's visit, and found all his cases complete failures. The lymph he used, I found, he brought on glasses ; and as his explanation for not bringing to the villages, a vaccinifer, and excuse for the failure of his lymph were far from satisfactory28 attacked the returns record 1,420 of them as having been previously vaccinated, of whom 787 are said to have died. Of the remaining 7,600 persons attacked and who were not previously vaccinated 781 are said to have died. Thus, according to these returns, of the people who seek protection from small-pox by vaccination, and who subsequently are attacked by it, 55, or rather more, percentum will die, while those who have sought no such protection and who are attacked by the disease succumb to it at the rate of 13 percentum. I think this per se is quite sufficient to show, without any further remark, the utter worthlessness of the in- formation we are forced to depend on with regard to the prevalence, fatality &c. of small-pox. The mere statement, that the mortality from small-pox amongst the previously vaccinated is some 55 percent, at once places without the range of reliance the whole body of death returns. The fact indeed chimes in very much in accordance with the received views regarding vaccination amongst a great mass of the native community, and that is, that it only serves to draw down on their devoted heads the anger of a goddess who would be otherwise passively quiet; probably this fact may have not been far from the minds of the village officers when filling up these mortuary returns and that it may have, in some unaccount- able manner, influenced them. However this may be, the fact exists, and I think in the face of it I may be excused from putting any trust whatever in the returns from which I extracted it. Seeing, as I have, frequently, the manner in which these statistics are recorded, the amount of intelligence amongst the men to whom they are entrusted, and over whom no guidance or control in this respect seem to be exercised, I cannot wonder at any result they may lead to. That small-pox did exist in these districts and to a' greater extent than these returns show I am fully aware, but what the mortality from it was, I cannot do more, than give a mer e conjecture. Probably the 13 percentum before alluded to would be a fair estimate; but considering that the sufferers are not submitted to skilled treatment in most instances, it would be found rather under the exact rate of mortality if that were attainable. Taking as correct the total number of deaths recorded in this circle from small-pox, viz. 1,568 that will give a death-rate from this one disease amongst the entire population of about 52 for every 100,000 of population. This rate of destruction is startling indeed, and should call of itself for some remedy, more especially when it is placed beside the fact that in countries where vaccination is made compulsory the rate of people who are merely attacked by small-pox aver- ages about 2.3 for every 100,000 of the population as shown by the Irish Census Commissioners in their report for 1872-73. Inoculation practised. 10. Having said so much regarding small-pox I would here offer a sugges- tion as to the best means, under existing circum- stances, of mitigating its ravages. Of course the only effectual mode of doing this, would be to make vaccination compulsory, but in the absence of compulsion, on the expediency of which opinion seems to be divided, though none differ as to the good which would result therefrom, it is necessary to caste about for some other means possessing more favour. First, I think, the pro- hibition of inoculation is a matter for the consideration, of which I make bold to say, the time has fully arrived; and notwithstanding that Government in their resolution on last year's report were pleased to view coldly any suggestions to this effect, I am emboldened by the fuller conviction another. year's experience has forced upon me of the want of such a measure, to again refer to it here. I entirely base my convictions regarding this want on the fact that practisers of inoculation wherever they carry on. their operations establish foci of contagion to the imminent danger and sometimes utter destruction of many people in the neigh- bourhood. In saying this, I am not giving vent to any thing new, but am merely repeating a fact already but too well known. As early as the opening of the present century the college of Physicians, London, in their report on the prac- tice of inoculation pointed out that, the receiver of it, though enjoying a protection for himself, acted as a contagious centre from which others become affected. Now, it is also a fact, pretty widely known, that the recipient of the natural disease by
29 inoculation, has sometimes his own life placed in jeopardy, by the very means he seeks for protection, as well as being a source of danger to those around him. For while the disease, so inoculated, may show itself in a few scattered pustules, with more or less of febrile disturbance, it may also come out in the confluent or most fatal form, and so actually destroy the life it was meant to preserve. I think that having said so much, I have said enough to show that, the practice of inoculation is not only dangerous to the life of the individual, but it is also dangerous to the public health generally: and yet, while a remedy is at hand, for the punishment of those who exhibit such dangers by other means, this is left to hold its way unquestioned. That inoculation is pretty extensively practised in some districts of this circle I have had frequent intimation of, and though in every case that has come to light the aid of civil authorities has been sought to prohibit it, yet I am fully convinced that it will never be effectually stopped without giving power to punish those who persist in practising it. No ill effects of vaccination. 11. After something over 5 year's experience now of the department, during which time, I may say I have tried to be as observant as circumstances would permit of, I have never noticed an instance where a specific disease other than cow-pox was introduced into the system through the agency of vaccination. I have however sometimes noticed ulceration, but not of a specific nature, at the seat of the vesicles which I have been always able to account for in two ways. The first was ill-treatment of the vesicle by the subject himself, tearing it open when it got irritable and applying some irritant remedies to it afterwards; and the second by the vaccinators making use of inflammatory lymph, or taking pus with the lymph, by pressing out too much, the vesicles on the vaccinifer. I once noticed an abscess formed in the vicinity of the vesicles, fortunately in time to remedy it, but this I only noticed once. With this slender experience of ills arising from vaccination I think I feel justified in pronouncing it benign in its effects. Small-pox after vaccination. 12. That small-pox will sometimes occur after successful vaccination I do not think will now be denied ; but then it is rather the exception than the rule, and it is, when so occur- ring, shorn of its fatality. I saw one unmistakeable case myself in a boy some 8 or 9 years old. He had three undoubted vaccine cicatrices on one arm which, 1 should pronounce very good, while scattered over the trunk and limbs were also indelible marks of small-pox pustules. His parents told me that he contracted the disease some three or four months after his being vaccinated, but that it affect- ed him so slightly that he was not confined to bed or the house for even one day ; while a brother of his, who was not previously vaccinated, and who contracted the disease about the same time, was so bad that his life was for a time despaired of and after recovery his face remained frightfully scarred, a fact I had myself an opportunity of witnessing. Aid from civil authorities. 13. I have had to make many and frequent applications during the year to the different district magistrates for assistance, when the vaccinator met with unusual opposition, and I am happy to say that in every case I met with a most cordial and ready desire to meet my wishes. It would help us not a little, if the collectors and assistant collec- tors would, on all occasions when they visit villages on other duty, make enqui- ries as to the state of vaccination there; and at the same time impress on the people the importance of it; and examine the vaccination and small-pox registers, kept by the village officers ; and see that they are kept with proper care and in proper form. Mr. Trevor, the first assistant collector at Nasik, I know from personal experience, does the latter, for I found in the Báglán táluká, which is under his charge, in almost every village I visited that, he had examined and initialled these registers. In the Kolábá collectorate this department was in the
30 habit up to June of last year of receiving aid from police authorities when sought for under difficulties, and I have often had to thank their assistance for the recep- tion of vaccination amongst communities of that district when other means failed to induce them to accept of it. About this time however Captain Payne, then acting superintendent of police in Kolába, seemed to think it no part of the duty of the police to give any assistance in the endeavour to protect the people from small-pox, and so issued instructions to his subordinates that they were for the future to forego the countenance they hitherto gave to vaccination. I was made acquainted with this fact by a communication from Captain Payne to the address of the Collector, Mr. Ovans, which was forwarded to me for perusal and remark by the latter. Neither the circumstance nor the communication seem to me however worthy of further remark in this report. Tour. 14. At the opening of the official year I was in the táluká of Murbád where I examined the work of Jairám Rághú. I found itsomewhat indifferent, and a testing of his register showed a good many errors more particularly in the result columns. Leaving this I proceeded to Shápur in which táluká I inspected the work and compared registers in 19 villages. The vaccinator's work was good and his register correct, but the village registers kept by the talátís were far from satisfactory. I next went to the Wádá táluká, with the work, &c. in which I was not at all pleased, and having pointed out means for improvement I passed on to the native state of Jawár. With the work here I was very well satisfied. I found no village vaccination registers were kept and on representing the fact to Mr. Robertson, the political agent, he ordered them to be undertaken by the talátís. In the beginning of May I left Jawár and travelled toward Dahámi inspecting the villages on either side of the way. The work was not altogether satisfactory, and as a result of my visit the vaccinator who was growing old and was of long service was recom- mended for pension which he has since obtained. From here I went to Máhim where I saw the work both of the táluká vaccinator and the dispensary, and wound up the month in the Bassein táluká examining the vaccinator's work, comparing the registers, &c. In June I took the office into Tháná and on the 4th of July I went on three months' privilege leave. On my return in October, I commenced the season on the 16th of that month by inspecting the work of the Salsette vaccinator in the neighbourhood of Ghorebandar, whence, having satisfied myself about it, I proceeded to Uran and saw the work of the municipal vaccinator and the dispensary with which I was satisfied,31 rather than inattention, and I know he has been doing much better since my visit. Here the Superintendent General left me. In January I examined the work in the Jámner táluká with which I was not at all satisfied. The vacci- nator, Mahipat Dharmáji, gave me a very poor opinion of his industry and atten- tion, and it was only by fining him then, and repeating it since, that I have been able to get him into working trim. Leaving this I went into the Bhosáwal táluká where I found the lymph had been lost. The vaccinator here, Ganesh Som- náth, left on me very much the same impression as Mahipat Dharmáji, and shared the same treatment. From here I crossed the Taptí into the Sáwadá táluká, where I saw some very good work which had been done by Sitárám Sadáshiva, and then passed on to Chopdá, where things were not at all to my satisfaction. The vacci- nator was a young hand whose work had never been seen by a superintentent before, so I had a good many things to point out for amendment which, I believe, has since taken place. In February leaving Chopdá I turned due west and still keeping north of the Tapí I visited the tálukás of Shirpur, Sháháde, and Talode ; from this I turned south, crossed the Tapí again and went through Nandurbár ; then Pimpalner and thence over the Selbári ghát into Báglan and Máligáon, which latter I reached on the 1st of March. The work in both Shirpur and Shá- háde was satisfactory. In Talode it was not so, and chiefly owing to the difficul- ties met with in consequence of the extreme ignorance of the people. In Nandur- bár things were not at all satisfactory. The man Mahádeo Bápuji was an old mu- nicipal vaccinator who had carried his old municipal habits with him of vaccinating only ten or twelve children a week. I however, pointed out to him freely, what would be the result of this course, and I am glad to say he has since shown some improvement. In Pimpalner I was satisfied with all I saw. In March I first saw the work of the Máligám vaccinator which pleased me, and leaving him I went into Báglán where I saw a good deal of the vaccinator's32 EASTERN GUJARÁTH CIRCLE. Superintendent.33 epidemic was most severe, viz., January, February, and March ; and the disease protected the rest and so left comparatively little work for the vaccinators this year. Total operations in circle. 3. Including the dispensaries, the total number of operations performedduring the year is 86,273 ; of these 84,105 were primary vaccinations, and 2,168 re-vaccinations. The successful operations are respectively 76,891 and 1,183. Deducting the excess of operations over persons from the primary vaccinations, the total number of persons primarily vaccinated is 83,417, giving an average of 26.8 persons to every thousand of population. 4. The following figures show the particulars of sex, caste, age and success in the primary vaccinations and percentage of success in re-vaccinations :34 only 13 were found to possess marks of previous vaccination. The total of that return, containing particulars of caste, age, &c. is given below :35 Vaccination in large towns not to be entrusted to dispen- sary officers only. 8. When, three years ago, our rural vaccinators were withdrawn from work- ing in all towns which have a dispensary, and the vaccination of these towns was entrusted to the dis- pensary officers, for several reasons, I felt great doubt about the advisability of the step. At any time and under any person, the carrying on of vaccination in large towns is a work of dif- ficulty. With an unnecessary amount of labor, and a great waste of time, a few children can only be vaccinated at a time. Even our vaccinators, who are expert operators and experienced men, accustomed to the drudgery work of hunting from house to house for unvaccinated children, and who feel that their daily bread depends upon their work, could not with all their tact and energy do much at a time : it was therefore, scarcely to be expected that hospital assistants, unac- customed to this work, could cope with the many difficulties that existed in these places : and almost every where, it took no time, for such of the people, as were well-disposed towards vaccination, to find out the want of practical knowledge and skill of the dispensary officers. The natural consequence of this was that, an accumulation of unvaccinated children occurred in all large towns : and this hap- pened markedly in Khedá zilhá. With two exceptions, viz., Balsád and Rándir, all the towns having dispensaries in Surat zilhá are small with a population of from one to four thousand inhabitants, and in them, the difficulty of finding out unvac- cinated children is comparatively loss. Similarly in Broach zilhá with the except ion of Jambusar and Ankleshwár, all the other towns have a small population. But in Khedá zilhá36 these 1,829 cases were carefully examined and on 13 were found marks of vaccination, 114 though said to be vaccinated had no marks. Of the cases noted as having marks of vaccination, I have no exact entries as regards the quality of the marks, but I perfectly well remember seeing one or two children at Kapadwanj, and one or two at Nariád, bearing good marks of vaccine cicatrices and yet being laid up with small-pox ; the rest had indifferent cicatrices. Going out of the circle I remember the case of a near relation of mine, a girl then about 10 years old laid up with severe small-pox in 1866 who was vaccinated in her infancy by an experienced practitioner ; and more recently of a son of mine vaccinated successfully by Mr Anantá Chantrobá in 1867, then about 8 or 9 months old, laid up last March with a mild attack of small-pox. I think there is no doubt of small-pox occuring after unmistakeably successful vaccination37 side of the village officials; this is not unnatural, but the collectors and their assis- tants have consequently, often to be troubled with these small complaints : and I am happy to state that in such matters, material aid, was received from many dis- trict officers, civil and political, during the year under report: and what is of far more importance, collectors and their assistants, take a direct interest in vaccina- tion, by making enquiries regarding the progress of it in their districts. Tour. 13. The first part of the year I travelled through Khedá zilhá, where I instituted strict inquiries regarding the causes and extent of the small-pox epidemic. The vaccinators were dependent upon hap-hazard information; there were no proper means of knowing the places where the disease was prevailing. Through each táluká mám- ledár strict inquiries were made, and steps were taken to send vaccinators to the infected localities. By the commencement of June the disease was nearly stam- ped-out in every quarter. A special report of this epidemic together with a return of the small-pox cases was prepared and submitted to the acting Superintendent General, on the 7th June, as already mentioned. On the 13th June I arrived at my monsoon quarters. I was out again during the first week of November; which, month was spent in travelling through Chorási, Ulpád and Ankleshwar tálukás, and in inspecting the several vaccinators' work. About the close of November, I left Ankleshwar for Anand, and from thence viâ Thásrá arrived at Bálásinur on 2nd December. It is unnecessary to state in detail the inspection work of each month. From December up to the close of the year I travelled through Rewá Kámthá and Panch Maháls. I specially undertook this journey with the view of acquainting myself with the men and of gaining some knowledge of the district that I may be better able to manage the vaccinators. The result of each vaccinator's inspection is contained in the monthly employment returns and it will be enough to state here, in general terms, that the state of vaccination in Panch Maháls and Rcwá Kánthá was as good as in other parts of this division with two exceptions, viz., in Chotá Udaipur and Rájpíplá, where only certain portions of these districts were vaccinat- ed, and the rest not attended to. Chotá Udaipur is an extensive state, and it is impossible for one man to manage its vaccination, besides the Darbár takes no interest in the matter. The whole of Rájpíplá has two men, and these happen to be brothers, who manage among themselves to vaccinate a tract of country all along the river Narmadá about 15 miles in breadth; the most southern part, the south- eastern and south-western Ságbárá and the hilly parts are not visited. Whilst travelling through. Rewá Kánthá I had an opportunity of calling upon the political agent at Pánwad who promised to do his best to induce the Darbárs to promote vaccination. Conduct of assistant super- intendents and vaccinators. 14. All the assistant superintendents and the vaccinators have worked with zeal and have conducted themselves satisfactorily with two exceptions, viz., the municipal vaccinator of Nariád and the neighbouring vaccinator of Mátartáluká. The former has been ordered to be dismissed for his bad conduct the,latter's case is under investigation.* * Has been dismissed the service since Dr. Colá's report was written.
38 WESTERN GUJARATH CIRCLE. Superintendent.39 have been attacked by the two vaccinators and by the assistant superintendent, who much to his credit and praise, has thrown himself into the thick of it, and is doing good service in vaccinating the unprotected children. This outbreak was no doubt due to the laziness and illness of the late vaccinator, who, had not kept up his vaccination in these villages. The cause of the outbreak at Dhánk, may be attributed to the same cause. In 1872-73 I fined Maganlal Rs. 10 for not going to this very town ; for two years after being fined, he carried his lymph towards the town, but when within a few kos reported himself sick and returned to Gondal. On the outbreak being reported, I started off the vaccinator who happened to be nearest the town and also the Gondal vaccinator. The first vac- cinated all the chirdren unprotected, since which I have heard of no more cases of small-pox in the town. I have not received a report of the number attacked with the disease, but I hear from the assistant political agent at Gondal that many died ; the outbreak was not reported to him till the whole town was more or less affected, and not till after the disease had been some time doing its deadly work. Since writing the above, I have received the report; 279 were attacked with small-pox and 40 died. The outbreak in the town ot Morvi was reported when it first commenced. The assistant superintendent Mr. Ranchoddás Mangaldás and the district vaccinator, who happened to be near, immediately repaired to the spot and very quickly put a check to its progress. 75 cases were reported but. no deaths. Besides the above, several isolated or sporadic cases have been repor- ted. I myself have seen no recent cases except in the above mentioned place, Dhanduká, where I was inspecting at the commencement of the outbreak. Inoculation. 4. No inoculation has been reported except those I alluded to last year. I do not think any real obstruction exists to the spread of vaccination. I am of opinion that if there were a vaccinator in every village, and, the man had pleasant and kindly manners, every child over one month old might be vaccinated. The courtesy of the vaccinator has much to do with the success, the parents hate having the lymph taken from the children's arms, and it requires much persuasion to over- come this feeling. One vaccinator reported that the parents destroyed the vesicles with ashes to prevent the lymph being taken. Irregularities in the vaccine disease. 5. During last rains many supplies of vaccine failed in parts of Kathewád. In Rajkote it was most remarkable. In July I exa- mined the vaccinator's cases; one week, I saw six children with perfect vesicles, three of these children I picked out for propagation. All the children vaccinated from them resulted in failure. At the same time, I had several reports of a like nature. The weather was very close and hot and the rainfall very slight. I have not seen any disease communicated other than cow-pox. Before the outbreak of small-pox in Dhan- duká, I noticed that after the 10th day many of the children's arms instead of healing and cicatrising showed signs of festering. Small-pox after vaccination. 6. I only saw one case of small-pox after vaccina- tion, and it was unmistakeable. 7. I have had numerous requests from different villages for vaccinators, proving that some of the people believe in vaccination. Aid from Government officers. 8. I have always received great assistance from all the Government officers both political and civil. I may especially mention Mr. Borrodaile and Captain Phillips, the latter has visited many villages with me and personally explained to the people the objects and benefits of vaccination. I am also indebted to his assistance for the great increase in the numbers returned by the Gondal state dispensaries.
40 Tour. 9. I left camp on the 1st October and commenced my tour by visiting Gondal, on account of the assistant political agent having complained of the vaccinator not doing his work efficiently. The man does not do as much work as he might, he being old and in bad health. Besides, his charge is too large. Not that he has too many villages but many of them are very populous. From Gondal I travelled direct to Ahmadábád to take over the new addition to my charge. On my route I visited the Wákáner man's work, which was good, but the cicatrices small; he had made the punctures so close together that in many cases they had become confluent. From Wákáner táluká I passed on and examined the Sáelá man's work which, was very good; he complained of not having enough to do, so I gave him temporary charge of twelve villages belonging to the Wadwán man that had not seen a vaccinator for two years. About the middle of the month I passed through the confines of the Dhrángdrá táluká and examined the vaccinator's work; it was good, but there were many villages with unprotected children. From Dhrángdrá I proceeded to Wadwan ; this man's work was good, but he had neglected to visit many of his villages. Early in November I inspected the Lakhtar man's work41 demanding fees ; he has since left the service. In Jámnagar the work was very good but many villages had not been visited during the year. In Judiá and Dharol the work was good and there were few unprotected childern. To sum up, I travelled through the Ahmadábád collectorate, the south-west and north-west, centre and cast, of Kathewád; and from what I saw, with the exceptions men- tioned, I believe the majority of the people were protected by vaccination, and that the vaccinators, as a body, were doing a fair average of work. Conduct of assistant super- intendents and vaccinators. 10. I have great pleasure in bringing to the notice of the Superintendent General the able assistance I have received from Assistant Superintendent Rancboddás Mangaldás and Assistant Superintendent Sardármia Nánamia ; they have done most valuable service in controlling the spreading of small-pox, as already mentioned. The vaccinators have on the whole worked well ; there are a few exceptions. Most of them have suffered more or less from sickness, and I have found great difficulty in procuring men to act for them, indeed in many instances the breach has not been filled and has resulted in the loss of lymph, which has, in some places, been re-introduced with much difficulty ; very many supplies of lymph in tubes having been destroyed in the post office by the stamping. 6 VAC
42 SINDH CIRCLE. Superintedent.43 having been made to vaccinate not merely as many as possible &quot; under 1 year &quot; but all above 1 year up to 15 years of age that were not, on inspection, found to be protected. Thus many who had been unsuccessfully or badly vaccinated be- fore, were submitted to the operation again ; the object being to have the whole population of the Province protected, so that vaccination might, in future, be confined chiefly to children &quot; under 1 year. &quot; Though much has been done in this direction, there is still a good deal left, which I trust may be accomplished in the current year. 2. In the absence of accurate registration of births, it is impossible to say what number of children should be vaccinated annually. But taking the English birth- rate as a guide, there should be over 80,000 children born annually in Sindh and making an allowance for deaths in infancy, there would remain 70, 000 to 75,000 to be vaccinated. Vaccination in Khairpur territory 3. The increase in the native state is apparently 2,390 ; but really should be 4,331, as the vaccinator's returns for the previous year were false in toto. Of the correctness of the past year's returns I am satisfied, as I examined his work in No- vember last and received a satisfactory report from the assistant superintendent after his inspection at the end of the official year. Finding the children in his territory unprotected, H. H. Mir Alimurad appointed a second vaccinator, and I am glad to say they are both now working well. There is a large amount of work to be done too ; for assuming that vaccination was not practised much for the pre- vious ten years (which I believe is not far from the truth)there must be still some 30,000 unprotected, if they have not been protected by small-pox. This vaccina- tor's returns were false, because his work had never been inspected, and this, because he was not a Government servant ; and I felt I had no right to enter foreign territory without special reason and permission ; that, intrusion on my part would be equally distasteful to His Highness and to Government. Some such feeling, I presume, prevented my predecessors from interfering. However, when I suspected the returns were false,I asked permission through the Political Agent, Colonel Dunsterville, to examine the vaccinator's work, and every facility and assistance were immediately given me. I now receive the returns on the condi- tion that I may at any time44 Caste. 6. Christians 157 ; hindús 15,853 ; musalmans 74,292 ; pársis 73 ; and other castes 9,269. The percentage of each compared with that of the preceding year is shown in this table45 also to assistance given by the assistant superintendents when visiting a dispensary town : they collect as many of the children of the town as they possibly can for inspection, and having lymph at hand, there and then vaccinate all the unpro- tected they can find. Of 3,660 children primarily vaccinated, there were 2,264 males and 1,396 females : a ratio of 61.86 males to 38.14 females. The propor- tion in the tálukás of males to females is about 5 per cent. less. There were about 18 hindus to 17 musalmans, whilst last year they were in the ratio of 11 to 13 respectively : this seems to be a good sign, as showing that the hindús avail themselves more freely of vaccination than they formerly did. About one-third of the number vaccinated were &quot; under one year.&quot; The percentage of success is low (92.8), owing, in some measure, to failures with tube lymph. One hundred and thirty persons were re-vaccinated. Small-pox. 12. Vaccination was very severely tried during the past year. The inva- sions of small-pox were incessant. It was at diffe- rent times introduced from Bháwalpur on the north, Belochistan (Khilat) on the west and Katch on the south, and it was brought by boat from Bombay and Katch, and from. Matra near Muscat in Arabia. It was intro- duced into the Karáchi, Shikárpur, Jacobábád, and Thar and Párkar districts, but into border tálukás or towns only, if we except Saidpur and Lárkháná. The Haidrá- bád zilhá being central escaped entirely. In the month of April it was prevalent in the tálukás of Ghorabári and Shahbandar. It was introduced into Karáchi town by a boy from Kútch ; into the tálukás of Nasirábád and Jacobábád from Khilát; into Saidpur from Bhawalpur and into Dipla in the Thar and Párkar from Katch ; but it was immediately extinguished in the latter district by assistant superintendent Mr. Lál Baksh. In May it was introduced into Obaoro from Bháwalpur. In June it was introduced into Lárkháná and Kambar from Khilat and extinguished in Jacobábád and Nasirábád. In July it was extinguished in Shahbandar. In August it re-appear- ed in Shahbandar and was extinguished in Lárkháná and Obaoro. In September it was extinguished in Ghorabri and Shahbandar and introduced into Jati by the Sír creek from Katch. In October the disease appears to have been quiescent every where. In November it re-appeared in Shahbandar and one case occurred in Ghora- bari. In December it seems to have finally disappeared from Ghorabari. Owing to its severity in Karáchi, Khilat, the people of the town of Shahpur asked the political superintendent of Frontier Upper Sindh that they might be vaccinated, and the Jacobábád vaccinator was sent by Colonel Loch to work amongst them. In Janu- ary the disease was extinguished in Shahbandar and introduced from Khilat into Thul in the Frontier Upper Sindh. In February it was introduced again into Obaoro from Bháwalpur and extinguished in Thul. In March it was introduced into Nagar Parkar from Katch and from Suigám. During the year there were 58 deaths from small-pox, viz., 27 in Ghorabari, 10 in Shahbandar, 10 in Karáchi town and 5 in Jati in the Karáchi collectorate; and 1 in Saidpur, 2 in Ob- aoro, 2 in Kambar, and I in Lárkháná in the Shikárpur collectorate. The large number of deaths in the Ghorabári and Shahbandar tálukás, I attribute entirely to the indolence of the two vaccinators, who had been placed in charge of them, viz., Parmánand and Watanmal, both of whom were discharged during the year. This district was unfortunate also in as much as its assistant superin- tendent was ill for two or three months. The greater number of deaths in Karáchi did not occur in the town exactly, but in a &quot; nest &quot; of fishermen lying somewhere between the town and the harbour, and at no great distance from Baba island. The two municipal vaccinators have been working very hard and deserve great praise. That the disease should have been so promptly suppressed in the Shikárpur zilhá, is due entirely to the ability and energy of assistant superintendent Mr. Hásá Mal. Vaccinator Sarupsing also worked admirably in Spaidur. Just now ( April ) the disease is prevalent in the táluká of Jati, where assistant super- intendent Mr. Gangaram has been placed. This táluká is in immediate communi- cation with Katch both by land and sea, and it is chiefly in the neighbourhood of Sirbandar and in the villages on the high road to Lakpat that the disease has
46 shown itself. One of the deaths that occurred in Jati and one of the two in Obaoro were of people who had been inoculated. No disease but cow-pox com- municated by vaccination. 13. There is not a single instance of any disease other than the cow-pox having been communicated by vaccination. Tour. 14. In April and May I was engaged in the Shahbandar and Jarak divisions testing the vaccinator's work, inspecting villages and tracing out small-pox to its orign. I found the disease in the tappa of Bablo, in the táluká of Shahbandar, where it had been brought by a woman who had been ill of it at Ketibandar. The villages on the island between Bable and Keti were full of the disease. In Keti itself the disease had existed se- veral months, but the hospital assistant then in charge of the dispensary had done nothing to suppress it, and told me that it &quot; had not been brought to his notice.&quot; However the present hospital assistant, Mr. Francis Jacob, has worked very hard and successfully at vaccination. I vaccinated in all the villages I went to, with tube lymph, and left assistant superintendent Mr. Lachman in special charge, as the vaccinator Parmánand had just been dismissed. I then roused up 2nd grade vacci- nator Watanmal to his work, for he had been apparently asleep, though he must have known that he was literally surrounded by small-pox. He worked very well for a few weeks, but as the Indus was rising, and the country about to be inundated, Watanmal betook himself to Mirpur Sacra, contrary to my instructions,and ultima- tely he was allowed to resign. I afterwards inspected the work of the Tattá vacci- nator, and sent him to Mr. Lachman's assistance. I visited the Tattá dispensary, where Mr. Apothecary Sylvester had vaccinated a large number of children. I then visited the Jarak dispensary and a considerable number of children were vaccinated in my presence, by hospitatal assistant Mr. Kisansing. In October I visited Bulá- khán Tándá dispensary and then marched up the left bank of the Indus accompanied by assistant superintendent Mr. Asumal through the Halá and Naoshero districts, visiting the Halá and Tharushá dispensaries and inspecting the work of the Hala Shahdadpnr, Sakrand, Morá, Naoshero and Khandiara vaccinators. I found all pretty satisfactory, excepting the work of Khanchand, whom I had to recom mend to be dismissed. At the Northern boundary of the Haidarábád zilhá I was joined by assistant superintendent Mr. Hásá Mal, and then entered H. H Mir Alimurad's territory and inspected the work vaccinator Ghaus Bakshlr had done since the month of April. He had no other to show. He had very good lymph and every thing pretty correct for what I may term a beginner. His High- ness appointed another vaccinator, Hakikat Rai, who was formerly employed in this office as a clerk, and who is a native of His Highness' territory, so that vacci nation is progressing with rapid strides now in his state. I then went over to the eastern portion of Rohri to inspect vaccinator Lokumal's work ; afterwards marched to the Rohri town, visited the dispensary and had to suspend operations by the hospital assistant in charge, pending an investigation into some charges made against him by the Panchayat. The táluká vaccinator was directed to carry on vaccination in Rohri town in the meantime, as well as in the taluka. I inspected the lymph at Sakkar. Next I went up through Saidpur and Ghotki to Mirpur Mátelo and Obaoro, specially examining the work done by vaccinator Sarupsin&quot;- and Mr. Hásámal in May and June, when very large numbers were returned as vacci nated. Every name returned was perfectly correct, but the work was not in every instance as good as it should be owing evidently to attempting to do too much. To make over 900 vaccinations in one month is no easy task, but it was done, and the object with which it was done was accomplished, viz., to stamp-out small-pox. The lymph in Mirpur and Obaoro was not so good as it might be, so I directed the two vaccinators to take supplies from Sarupsing, who had splendid lymph. Hav- ing got up as far as the Bháwalpur territory, I crossed the Indus to the Upper Sindh Frontier districts,and inspected the work of the vaccinators of Kasmor and Thul. I considered they had not done sufficient work and explained this to them. I went on to Jacobabad, Shikarpur and Sakkar, inspecting the work in
47 the towns and talukas. Thence I worked my way through the Naoshero, Rátáde- rá, Larkháná, Kambar, Nasirábád, Mehar and Kakkar talukas into the Karachi collectorate ; visiting the Larkháná and Mehar dispensaries cn roule. Continuing my march down the right bank of the Indus, I inspected the work of the Dadu, Sihwán, Mánjhándá and Kotri vaccinators and visited the Sihwán dispensary. In the latter part of January, I went across the Haidrabad collectorate to the Thar and Párkar, examining by the way the work of the Haidrabad municipal and taluka vaccinators, of the Alayar and Sháhdádpur vaccinators, then taking the course of the Nárá and Puran rivers to the Ran of Kutch, I inspected the work done in the Sánghar, Kiprá, Umarkot and Dipla talukas and visited the Kipra and Umarkot dispensaries. From Rahimki bazár I entered the southern portion of the Haidrábád collectorate, traversed the Badin, Baga-Ka-Tánda, and the Guni talukas, and at the end of March was in the Shah bandar district, in the neighbour- hood of which, owing to the prevalence of small-pox, I intend remaining for some time, in order to ensure work being done as well and rapidly as possible. From Statement No. VII., I find that I travelled 2,822 miles, visited 532 villages and inspected 20,925 vaccinated children. From the vaccinators' registers I called 6,595 names ; of these there are only 20 names unaccounted for, and I cannot say that, even one of these is a false entry : they are the names of children whom the patil cannot identify as belonging to his village. Ten of them were entered as belonging to the village of Jungo Jalbani in the Shahbandar taluka, and as the man who had returned them was not present to explain matters (he having been transferred to another part of (he zilha in consequence of a resident of Shahbandar having been recently appointed to this taluka), I had no alternative but to put, them down as unaccounted for. They were probably the children of people who had temporarily taken up their abode near the village of Jungo Jalbani. Correctness of vaccinators' returns. 15. If we except the vaccinator of H. H. Mír Alimurad in the Khairpur ter- ritory, who has &quot;turned over a new leaf,&quot; I have found but one instance of falsification, and that on a very small scale. The case is that of Ramchand, vac- cinator in the Mirpur Batora taluka, who having been idle during the inundation, season, in order to make his returns appear better, dared to enter the names of some half dozen children in the return for October that had been already given in the return for September. Ráamchand has just been dismissed in consequence. Every vaccinator is aware that for the least falsification he is liable to be dismissed, hence we have very few instances of such cases. Conduct of vaccinators and assistant superintendents. 16. Speaking generally, the vaccinators have behaved exceedingly well and have worked very hard: but, there are two or three who reflect no great credit on the Department. The assistant superintendents have worked exceedingly well, as is evinced by the amount of work done in their districts. Mr. Hásámal and Mr. Lál Baksh are especially deserving of praise. There was no small-pox in Mr. Asumal's district; he had not therefore the same opportunity of distinguishing himself; but notwithstanding this he has done excellent work. Mr. Lachman failed during the year owing to sickness, he has not been so successful in coping with small-pox as Mr. Hásámal or Mr. Lal Baksh. Aid of civil and political officers acknowledged. 17. I have much pleasure in recording that I have received every assistance from all the authorities in carrying on my work. This has made my duties comparatively agreeable. I am under great obligation to the Commissioner in Sindh, Sir W. Merewether, for his invariable kindness in helping and advising me. I am also much indebted to Colonel Dunsterville, both as Political Agent of Khairpur and as Collector of Haidrábád. My thanks are due to Mr. Douglas Crawford for so successfully using his influence with the people of large towns in his district in favour of vaccination ; to Captain Mayhew who, accompanied me through the whole of his district in search of small-pox ; and to Mr. Tyndall for special assistance at the dispensary towns of Tattá and Jarak.
48 KUTCH CICLE. Superintendent.49 Population. 8. Kutch, though a small province, has 868 villages, mostly, thinly populated ; of which 520 belong to the Darbár and 348 to the Bhá- yáds. According to the census of 1871, the Darbár population consisted of 302,254 and that of the Bháyáds of 184,646, giving a total of 486,900. On finding an average population for each village, it comes to 561 souls. Vaccine establishment. 9. During the early part of the year under report, the establishment con- sisted of 9 vaccinators, but their number was sub- sequently increased to 11 and one assistant superintendent. His Highness employed 1 assistant superintendent and 6 vacci- nators. Of the latter, three were located in the biggest towns of the circle, viz., Mándvi, Bhuj, and Mundrá ; the remaining three moved about. The acting assistant superintendent acted as such in the latter part of the year only, but was acting as a vaccinator for the previous time. 5 vaccinators were employed by Bháyáds. 10. The work done under each of the above divisions was as follows : 50 free from small-pox. On these days they do not partake of any newly cooked article, but live on sweetmeats or other articles prepared on a previous day. Notwith- standing all this, if their children happen to be attacked with small-pox, they again, on the 7th or 9th day of the attack, go to the goddess and perform the above ceremonies. They have so much faith in her, that even after their child- ren are vaccinated, on the 7th day they proceed and offer certain articles to her. Such children as do not suffer from small-pox are considered under the protection of the goddess rather than of vaccination. With such a firm belief in the deity they treat vaccination with contempt and consider it as a curse rather than any good. With such ignorance and apathy, the vaccinators find it very difficult to get on : all sorts of devices are practised to escape vaccination. As soon as it is known a vaccinator is going to a village, many will either lock up the doors of their houses, giving one to understand that nobody is in the house, or conceal their children in big earthern pots intended to hold grain, or in some cases they run a way to some of their relations in a neighbouring village. This difficulty can only be removed by one of the two following ways, by allowing them time to be- come more civilized and to see the advantages of vaccination or by making vacci- nation compulsory. 12. The complaints from vaccinators were generally of two kinds : one was about opposition to vaccination from the people, and the other about not getting their allowances. Such complaints when received were brought either to the notice; of the darbár or the Political Agent, according as the subject belonged to His High- ness or to the Bháyáds. Orders were issued from one of the two sources, advising the people to get their children vaccinated and that the vaccinators be paid their allowances. In this way much valuable time was lost and in consequence of such delays vaccinators often lost lymph which required to be re-supplied. All this was attended with waste of time and as a natural result the progress of vaccination was slow. Salaries of vaccinators. 13. The vaccinators were paid regularly every month by His Highness accord- ing to fixed rates. While they were travelling, they were allowed a pony or camel, and a peon each. A vaccinator, when he went out of Bhuj, was allowed to draw from the local funds of each village Rs. 0-14-0 per day to cover his and his peon's batta, and pony feeding, as long as he stopped there for the purposes of vaccination. This ar- rangement formed one of the obstructions in the way of vaccination as described in the last para. In order to remedy this, I have to bring the subject to His High- ness' notice and suggest a different arrangement for the current year in the billow- ing way, that instead of collecting funds at a time when a vaccinator is working in a village, such funds should be collected from each village, in the beginning of each year by durbar servants and that the vaccinator should be paid his travelling allowances along with his pay by the darbár instead of by the kámdár or pátil of each village. The same suggestion will he made to the political agent for making a similar arrangement for the Bháyáds' vaccinators. When this difficulty is remov- ed, the vaccinators will have only to contend with the religious prejudices and ignorance of the mass of the people. Animal vaccination. 14. In Novemher, while Surgeon R. M. Wall was in charge of a portion of a native regiment here, he having had some experience in animal vaccination, expressed his desire to the Political Agent to introduce it into Bhuj. The latter wished me to arrange for a calf, and accordingly the first heifer was inoculated on 19th November with lymph obtained by Dr. Wall from Mr. Anantá Chandrobá, Bombay. Subsequent to this inoculation of calves and vaccination of children were conjointly carried on by Dr. Wall and me till loth January ; hut on his departure to Bombay shortly after, the work was conducted by me. The result of the work for four and a half months was that 22 calves were inoculated and 152 children vaccinated. Of (ho
51 latter 97 were successful, 40 unsuccessful, and 15 doubtful. The following table shows the work of each month with results 52 Aid from Political Agent. 20. Thanks are due to Captain G. R. Goodfellow, the acting Political Agent, for the ready assistance given in the cause of vacci- nation whenever wanted throughout the year. Tour of assistant superinten- dent. 21. The assistant superintendent, who in the early part of the year was vac- cinating himself (in consequence of having very little to inspect), submitted certain forms which give the following result:53 EXTRACTS FROM THE REPORTS OF CIVIL SURGEONS AND DISPENSARY OFFICERS. AHMADNAGAR CIVIL HOSPITAL. Surgeon-Major H. T. Dann, B.A., Civil Surgeon. Population 32,841 Vaccination was performed very assiduously in the civil hospital dis- pensary during the year under report, and with, I am happy to say, very good success, as will be seen from the absence of failures. 72 children of all ages were vaccinated, all of them proved successful. 46 male and 26 female children were vaccinated. In rare cases the children vaccinated were not presented by their parents punctually on the 8th day (although the result was afterwards known), and consequently I had occasion to receive lymph from the municipal vaccinator to continue the usual operations. This year there was no appearance of small-pox. SHOLAPUR DISPENSARY. Mr. Narsu Gurappa, 2nd Class Hospital Assistant. Population 53,403. The number of persons vaccinated during the year was 572, being an increase of 58 above that of the last year. Of these 283 were males and 266 females. There were 2 christians, 408 hindús, 132 musalmans, 1 pársi, and 6 other castes. 289 being under and 200 above one year old. 2. In 564 primary operations, 524 were successful, 32 unsuccessful and 8 unknown. 15 of the unsuccessful were vaccinated twice as the first operation proved unsuccessful. 3. There were 23 persons revaccinated during the year. They were all males. The operation in 13 proved successful and in 10 unsuccessful and doubtful. The lymph used was good. The vesicles were normal and of the size of a grain of pulse. 4. Vaccination does not appear to be progressing rapidly in this town. Al- though the children are operated upon at the dispensary, still I and the native medical pupils go about the different parts of the town and induce people to get their children vaccinated. The brahmins seem to be the only caste that volun- tarily bring their children to the dispensary or ask me or the municipal vaccinator to go to their houses to vaccinate their children. The other castes are still un- willing to subject their little ones to the operation of the lancet. What they dread most is taking the lymph from the vesicles on the eighth day. Even the most intelligent try to avoid this.

Bell, M.D., Superintendent. Population 4,006. During the season under report vaccination was successfully practised in every case that presented itself. The most favorable months for vaccination are April and May, and I may here remark that after careful observations for some years, it may now be regarded as an established fact that on this range of hills the results are more successful if attempted after the hot season commences, very few proving successful during the cold months. Lymph in tubes was obtained on three diffe- rent occasions from the superintendent of vaccination, central circle which proved active and good. In all 38 operations were performed ; in these, 3 were excess of operations over persons, and 35 were individuals primarily vaccinated, 13 males and 22 females ; 21 being under one year and 14 over a year old ; result of the total operations was 22 successful 14 unsuccessful, and 2 unknown. VENGURLA DISPENSARY. Apothecary Mr. D. M. Munday. Population 10,618. The total number vaccinated was 228, viz., males 133, females 95; of which 147 were under one year and 81 above one year old; 221 proved successful. 4 unsuccessful and doubtful and 3 unknown giving a percentage of 98.2 of success- ful cases. 2. Vaccination has been performed by the native; medical pupil attach- ed to the civil hospital at the station in the presence of the apothecary in medical charge of the civil station. 3. There has been an increase of 55 in the number vaccinated compared with the previous year, owing to the assistance rendered by the mahalkari of this place who gave stringent orders to the pátils to assist with the register of births and on all occasions to accompany me from house to house, and persuade the parents of the children to allow the operation to be per- formed. In a short time there will be no means of keeping up vaccination constantly, for all will be protected by vaccination. Hitherto nothing but an epidemic, of small-pox in the neighbourhood has induced the richer class or Gujars to allow their children to Be vaccinated. Improvement might be made if vaccination were made compulsory, but as it is not compulsory many children are not operated upon until they are over one year old, owing to the obstinacy of their parents. Our system is to go from house to house in all parts of the place and vaccinate all that can be found unprotected of all ages. 4. There has not been an outbreak of small-pox. 5. Revaccination is positively objected to by all classes.
55 DAPULI DISPENSARY. Honorary Surgeon A. Pollard. Population 8,177. During the year 1873-74 there have been 363 vaccine operations in Dá- puli, and in the villages in the neighbourhood, all of which have been pri- mary operations. Of this number 24 persons were operated on twice each, so there were 339 persons operated on. 185 were males and 154 females. As regards caste or religion, 4 were christians, 279 hiudús and 56 musalmans. 119 were under one year old and 220 above that age. 331 were suecesful, 29 unsuccessful or doubtful and 3 unknown. Compared with the year 1872-73 there has been an increase of 29 persons operated on, with more success, the percentage of successfull operations in 1872-73 being 81.0 against 91.9 in 1873-74. The three unknown cases had left the village between the time of operating on them and the 8th day following and who could not consequently be seen. 2. I do not think there is such difficulty experienced lately as there used to be, in obtaining subjects for vaccination, especially in the villages and hamlets about the country, but there are still some difficulties in Dápuli where brahmins, vakils, karkuns. kotes &c. reside and they object to have their children vaccinated, and make all sorts of excuses : but occasionally there are some who come and request that their children may be vaccinated ; however this is certainly the exception, and it need not be said that their request is at once complied with ; I trust ere long I shall be able to say that this is the rule instead of the exception. 3. Vaccination has been carried on slowly but steadily throughout the year, some few children being operated on weekly, that a supply of lymph may be always available should any demand arise for it. My dispensary servant having been taught to vaccinate, is sent in different directions within a moderate area, and according as his services can be spared to the different villages and hamelts around Dápuli, and if at a convenient distance I gene- rally examine his work, if too far and out of my range the assistant su- perintendent or the superintendent of vaccination makes it a point of doing so at their visits ; were I not to do this. I wouid not be able to vaccinate many as the village of .Dápuli with the camp contain but. a small population ; altogether from this source only 79 children have been obtained during the past year. 4. The several villages visited by myself and dispensary servant for the purpose of vaccination during the past year, are given below together with the population as taken in last census, but how far the numbers can be depended on I am unable to say. I cannot say whether or not any of those villages have been visited by any local fund or other vaccinator during the past year, but at the time of my visiting them all the children that could be got were operated on. Dápuli camp and village ........................ 2,808 population. Jimona................................................ 976 56 5. I have not had any reports made to me of small-pox epidemics in any of the surrounding villages during the year under notice. KARWAR CIVIL HOSPITAL. Surgeon S. J. Goldsmith, Civil Surgeon (acting). Population 13,263. The number of vaccinations performed at the civil, police, and jail hospitals and by the dispensary officer in the municipal towns is as follows :57 down in its place : the clothes if of poor material are burnt, if of greater value they are disinfected with chlorine and then boiled : and at the same time vaccination is being carried on more vigorously than before as there are many people here still unprotected : and re vaccination is also performed as much as possible. I fear that lately the dispensary medical officer has relapsed somewhat in his efforts to try and induce all the unprotected to be operated on, otherwise I cannot account for the great number of people who are still unprotected and who therefore are liable to bad unmodified small-pox. Vaccination is now however being carried on vigorously on three days of every week and before each of these days persons are sent round to look up all the unprotected, both children and adults, but it is very difficult to induce the latter to submit to the operation. Revaccination. 8. I believe all that is possible is now being done to arrest the disease : the two most important things are isolation and vacci- nation ; but the former I believe to be impossible, we must therefore rely upon the latter and endeavour to have it carried out more vigorously and carefully than ever. KOLHÁPUR CIVIL HOSPITAL. Honorary Surgeon G. Sinclair. Population 38,979. In forwarding the accompanying vaccination returns exhibiting the work done at the civil hospital and dispensary, Kolhápur infantry and jail during the past official year, I would beg leave to make the following observations on the work done by the hospital assistants attached to each of these charges, because I think that a separate notice of each will give much encouragement and promote greater zeal in the cause of vaccination. 2. 360 vaccine operations were performed by 3rd Class Hospital Assistant Vithal Dhanájí at the civil hospital and dispensary during the past year ; 309 of these were successful, giving a percentage of 96.2, while the proportion of children under one year amounted to 35.8 per cent. of the whole number. Compared with the number vaccinated during the previous year there is a decrease of 147, which is attributable to two causes ; firstly, the station vaccinator worked in the town of Kolhápur and so reduced the number of children who would otherwise have been brought to the dispensary ; and secondly, but principally to the lull caused by the absence of small-pox throughout the past year. Great apathy and indifference is exhibited by natives generally in bringing their children for vaccination until their fears are fairly excited by the presence of epidemic small-pox among them. 3. Vaccination is regularly performed every Monday morning throughout the year and continues to be regarded as an important element in dispensary practice. The quality of the lymph has been good and the resulting vesicles and cicatrices were very satisfactory. 4. 57 children were vaccinated during the past year at the Kolhápur in- fantry hospital by 1st Class Hospital Assistant Cáshirám Chawán. They were all under one year. 54 of these were successful, giving a ratio of 94.7 per cent. Revaccination has been carefully and regularly carried out during the past four years. Every man, woman and child belonging to the Corps has been brought under the protective influence of this prophylactic. 5. On the principle that revaccination is not only a measure of renewed security against small-pox, but as a test of the completeness of the protection afforded by previous vaccination or inoculation, every prisoner admitted into jail 8 VAC
58 is revaccinatcd. This course has been pursued during the past four years, and the unusual number of positive results attending these operations is remarkable. During the past year 369 prisoners were revaccinated. The lymph was always obtained from healthy infants who had been vaccinated at the dispensary during the preceding week. Of 369 revaccinations, 33 presented marks of previous vaccination, 290 had marks of small-pox and 46 bore marks of inoculation. The results in the 369 operations were as follow :59 viously vaccinated the revaccination was successful in 63, unsuccessful in 34 and the result in 5 was unknown. Of those who had the inoculation or small-pox before, 16 were successful and 6 unsuccessful. 5. The condition of the lymph during the year was mostly good. When- ever it failed it was renewed from the state vaccinator. Weekly vaccinations from arm-to-arm were performed almost througout the year in all the different parts of the town. Vaccination is firmly established in this state and though the people are not very forward to have it, yet they have no objections to its per- formance. Small-pox. 6. 10 sporadic cases of small-pox occurred in the town during the year; one case was in May, 2 were in January, 3 in Febru- ary and 4 in March. All the subjects had been vac- cinated and they all recovered. In 5 the small-pox was distinct and in 5 it was con- fluent. There was some small-pox in the districts generally throughout the year. The state vaccinator has said about 131 cases, 74 in males and 57 in females ; 51 were vaccinated and 80 were unprotected. 13 of the unprotected died. ALIBAG DISPENSARY. Assistant Surgeon M. F. Pereira, L.M. Population 5,473. Vaccination and revaccina- tion. During the year 1873-74 the total number of vaccinations (primary) and revaccinations was 209 or 2 more than in the preceding year. 200 were pri- mary and 9 revaccinations. Result and percentage 2. Primary vaccination was successful in 182 cases, giving a percentage of 91 ; revaccination succeeded in 8 out of 9 cases, giving a percentage of success of 88.8. Caste, age and sex. 3. All the revaccinations were performed on christians. Primary vaccina- tion was practised on 177 hindus, 9 musalmans and 14 jews. Of these 103 were males and 97 females ; 94 were under and 106 above the age of one year. Small-pox. 4. This cruptive fever prevailed to a slight extent in the months of April and May, and again in November and December. In the month of May the European, gentry were revac- cinated, and the result showed that they were not protected by the former vac- cination performed in infancy. Although these examples were before the eyes of the natives, yet I could not prevail on even one of them to receive revaccination. Lymph. 5. The quality of the lymph was very good, but whenever it deteriorated it was renewed. The failure in the 18 cases was attri- butable, probably, to the lymph having been forwarded to me in tubes. Arm-to-arm vaccination invariably gave successful results. As it is not possible to get children every eight days to keep up the supply, it renders the use of tubes a matter of necessity. However, direct vaccination was practised as much as possible. The supply of lymph was sometimes obtained from the tá- luká vaccinator, but that forwarded by the district vaccinator of Pen gave the most satisfactory results. House to house vaccination. 6. This was the only way in which vaccination could be performed. Al- though the people believe in the benefits conferred by vaccination, yet they, through mere indifference or inability to perform certain religious ceremonies connected with the small-pox,
60 generally try to evade or postpone vaccinating their children. This circumstance renders it necessary to carry on vaccination from house to house. I received very little assistance from the mámledár. Area. 7. Dispensary vaccination extended over the town of Alibág, containing 5,473 inhabitants according to the last census, and the neighbouring villages of Chendrá, Warsoli and Chál- málá. PEN DISPENSARY. Mr. Haríráo Powár, 2nd Class Hospital Assistant. Population 6,514. The total number of vaccinations amounts to 121 or 60 more than in the pre- vious year. All were primary vaccinations. 111 were hindús. 66 under one year and 55 above it. One was a grown up person. 1 had 9 operations in excess of persons. 107 were successful, 21 unsuccessful and the result of the remaining two was unknown. The percentage of successful vaccination was 83.5. The people of this town are generally against vaccination. I took every op- portunity of informing them of the very many benefits that arise from vaccination ; but I am really very sorry to say that all my attempts to remove their prejudices have been fruitless. Though they admit this innovation to be good, yet they are deterred from adopting it, on the ground that they thereby incur the displeasure of the goddess Shitalá. Of late, through the assistance given by Ráo Sáheb Pándu- rang Sadáshiva Sháháne, mámledár of this táluká, I am very happy to say that, I was able to vaccinate a good many children. MÁT'HERAN. Surgeon-Major David Simpson, M.D., Superintendent. Population......(small and variable). Vaccination has been performed as shown in the accompanying statement by 1st Class Hospital Assistant Mr. Gangáji Ramji ; at the present time all the chil- dren are protected. Under 1 year 3 vaccinations are reported, over 1 year 7 chli- dren have been vaccinated ; the age of the oldest was 5 years, the others were be- tween 1 and 2 years of age. The parents of the children submit to have their chil- dren vaccinated but very few of them show any anxiety to have the operation per- formed, and in some instances their sanction could only be obtained by making known amongst them that unprotected children could not be permitted to remain on the hill. During the past year the existence of small-pox in Matheran or in its vicinity has not been known. KURLA' DISPENSARY. Assistant Surgeon Cuvarjí Dorábjí, G.G.M.C. Population 3,000. 142 children were vaccinated, being 44 more than in the previous year. The operations were mostly performed by the assistant surgeon in charge and a few by the native medical pupil attached to the dispensary. The population in which these operations were performed was about 3,000. The people of this district, chiefly the christians, seem to appreciate the bene- fit of this prophylactic and willingly submit their childern to it, but are
61 very unwilling to allow the lymph to be taken from their children's arms, for the purpose of vaccinating other children. This acts as a great draw- back, the lymph supply gets interrupted and often a week or two pass with- out any operations being performed. 2. The percentage of successful cases was 90.7. 3. The lymph employed was generally good, but great difficulty was ex- perienced in keeping up its supply. Lymph was introduced several times from Bombay, by sending a man by train so that it might be used the same day. 4. No cases of small-pox were admitted during the year. KALIA'N DISPENSARY. Assistant Surgeon A Bomanjí, G.G.M.C. Population 12,804. 161 Operations were performed during the year. This number, when com- pared with the population of the town, which according to the last census is 12,804, is I must confess small. There is no want of zeal on my part nor of aid from the mámledár and other officials, but the people are much behind in recog- nizing the value of vaccination. For the most part they offer resistance to vacci- nation and still greater resistance against allowing lymph to be taken from their children's arm, so much so that for the latter three and a half months of the year62 suits. 178 men were operated upon, and 40 men were operated upon twice ; 170 operations succeeded and 48 failed, giving a percentage of 77.9 successful cases. Small-pox.63 GODHRA' DISPENSARY. Assistant Surgeon Shántarám Vináyak Kantak, L.M. Population 10,641. During the past year 466 individuals were vaccinated primarily against 356 in the previous year. Vaccination was performed throughout the past year in the town. During the greater part of the year the lymph was good, but it deteriorated about the months of October and November. As vaccination in a kasbá town, throughout the year, is very difficult to accomplish from the paucity of numbers, I submit that it might cease four months in the year during the monsoon. The people are averse to getting their children vaccinated during the hot season. It will be seen from the return that the musalman element predomi- nates. The police authorities lend me the assistance of a police peon to enable the police patil to collect children. There is no doubt that the people have felt the benefits of vaccination ; but they resolutely refuse to allow lymph to be taken out of their children's vesicles. They seem to think that a child gets weakened and anæmic by such abstraction of lymph. 2. There has been no epidemic of small-pox in the town of Godhrá during the past year. GOGO DISPENSARY. Mr. Lewis George, Apothecary. Population 9,571. The total number of persons vaccinated during the year has been 254. 141 males and 113 females ; among them were two male adults, who being sea-faring men had to obtain a certificate of having been vaccinated. One of these had faint marks of having been vaccinated, and the other had visible marks of having had small-pox; the latter on being revaccinated, took the disease, but the youth who had faint marks of having been previously vaccinated did not. There has been an excess of 58 operations over the preceding year, when only 198 were vacci- nated. The vaccination up to the 10th October 1873 was steady in progress, and although the lymph on that date appeared good, yet the vesicles were small on the 8th day, and the only way I could account for this deterioration is by the thermometric maximum sun's rays having considerably increased on the 6th idem to 135° and on the 17th idem I saw that the vaccination had completely failed. It was found afterwards difficult to obtain good lymph in tubes, as only 3 children were vaccinated in November and 2 children in December from lymph received in capillary tubes from the assistant superintendent of vaccination who was then at Talajá, and these failed, which rendered vaccination in abeyance till the 23rd January 1874 when the superintendent of vaccination sent some lymph in tubes, and this was successful, and from this period I vaccinated 93 children, giving a result of 11 unsuccessful vaccinations from 93. Although the vaccina- tions have not proved uniformly successful, yet I have been fortunately keeping up the vaccination till the arrival of the present superintendent, who has now introduced English lymph, and I hope to continue up the success.
64 KARACHI CIVIL HOSPITAL. Surgeon Major N. Hopkins, Civil Surgeon. Population 51,822. Vaccination has been carried on during this year as previously, by one of the vaccinators provided by the municipality. 2. The vaccinator sends his returns to the superintendent of vaccina- tion in Sindh through me. He brings me some children every week so as to enable me to report every month on the character of the vesicles and lymph. 3. There were only 2,828 persons vaccinated and revaccinated during the year, which the vaccinator explains by the increased difficulty in getting children to be vaccinated as there has been no small-pox about to frighten the parents ; among primary vaccinations there were 1,754 successful, 100 unsuccessful and 46 unknown ; of the number of revaccinations 989, there were 591 successful, 375 unsuccessful, and 23 unknown, giving a percentage of 94.6 in primary and 61.1 in revaccination. 4. The pay of the vaccinator is Rs. 15 a month, or Rs. 180 a year, the contingent bills amounted to Rs. 53-8-0, so that the cost of the whole working establishment was only Rs. 233-8-0, which divided by the operations gives one anna and three pies as the cost of each operation and one anna and seven pies as the cost of each successful operation. 5. There is a great increase in the number of revaccinations over former years ; this is in a great measure due to revaccination being carried out thoroughly in the jail. All convicts who have not distinct cicatrices of either vaccination or small-pox are vaccinated. Persons vaccinated at the jail and hospitals were not included in this return, but were shown separately till this year. The vaccinator reports that he has great difficulty in getting some parents to permit their children to be vaccinated, and afterwards there is great difficulty in finding them to ascertain the result, and it is only when small-pox comes to the immediate neighbourhood that they seek vacci- nation. KETI BANDAR DISPENSARY. Mr. F. Jacob, 3rd Class Hospital Assistant. Population 2,199. The total children vaccinated during the year is 228, being 167 in excess of the previous year. 2. The quality of the lymph was very good. 3. On my arrival in April last, I heard that small-pox was prevailing in the town and adjacent villages. I immediately applied for and obtained fresh lymph from the táluká vaccinator and vaccination was practised until 15th July last. The assistant superintendent of vaccination, Karáchi collec- torate, on visiting this dispensary in February last, informed me that one case of small-pox had been seen by him in the out-skirts, in close proximity to this station : I therefore applied to the vaccinator for fresh lymph and commenced vaccinating the children newly-born and also those that were left unvaccinated from July owing to their illness. 19 cases of small-pox have been reported at the kotwál's office during the year, of these 3 were males, 10 females, and 6 children, out of these 3 cases proved fatal. None of these applied
65 for treatment at the dispensary. During the prevalence of this epidemic great sanitary precantions have been taken since my arrival. The disease disappeared from this town immediately on finishing the vaccination in July last. TÁTTA DISPENSARY. Mr. Sylvester, Apothecary. Population 7,951. The number vaccinated this year is 342, and the number of operations were 364 or 23 in excess of persons. In comparing the number vaccinated with the preceding year there appears an increase of 233 in favour of this year. This in- crement is due to the following circumstance. At the end of March it was reported that there were 105 children still unprotected in the town, although previous to this vaccination was carried on continuously from week to week, and the peons could not succeed in bringing more than 3 or 4 at a time. However during the month of April last, with the assistance of the head munshi and some of the municipal commissioners, I managed to obtain 76 children for vacci- nation. Again during the month of May Dr. Williams visited this town, and through his influence nearly 700 children were collected for inspection. Out of this number 163 were found unprotected and lymph being at hand. 104 of them were vaccinated by me on the spot and others gradually afterwards, so that in the month of May there were in all 190 children operated upon. Since then vaccination continued until the end of December, when no more children could be had. 2. Out of the number vaccinated there were 233 males and 108 females and these when classified according to caste were 198 hindús and 143 musalmans : 60 of them were under one year and 281 above it. The result of those primarily vaccinated was 272 successful, 72 unsuccessful and doubtful, and 20 unknown ; the percentage of successful cases being 79.0. Several of the unsuccessful cases were operated on two or three times without beneficial results. One young man with faint marks of previous vaccination was revaccinated unsuccessfully. 3. The condition of the lymph was generally good. The vesicles were round and pearly with a central depression, the skin surrounding it being lense, painful, and rosy red in fair children. The cicatrices were circular foveated, depressed, and of a darkish colour. 4. I am glad to record that there has been no case of small-pox this year. I am not aware of inoculation being practised here. The chief obstacle to the spread of vaccination is the prejudices amongst hindús ; as they believe that their deity is displeased if the children are vaccinated, and many of them in consequence prefer to be attacked by small-pox. This idea could only be removed gradually as education advances, and the benefits of vaccination are more appreciated. 5. This is a large town and although a great many have been vaccinated this year, I am assured there are still more unprotected ; and these can only be de- tected by frequently going about the streets. Very few voluntarily present their children for vaccination, and those vaccinated are often hidden to prevent the lymph being removed. Often, children vaccinated during a week cannot be found next week, and if these are present fresh subjects are not forthcoming. Also the mukhtiarkar's peons being frequently changed, the children are brought irregu- larly, and thus the lymph becomes degenerated and unfit for use. To obviate all these drawbacks and to ensure the dissemination of vaccination effectively I would suggest that a special peon should be allowed me, whose duty should be solely to look out for children during the week and have them ready on the vaccination day. 9 VAC
66 6. With the exception of sometimes an erythematous or eczematous eruption occurring after vaccination on the arms of children, I have not observed any irregularity in its progress or any ill effects resulting from it. 7. In this town only one case of small-pox after successful vaccination was brought to my notice, and it was a very modified type of the disease. 8. During the last year when small-pox broke out in this town, only those who were not vaccinated were attacked, while the vaccinated children escaped the disease. MEHAR DISPENSARY. Mr. Hanmantráo Bhosle, 3rd Class Hospital Assistant. Population 1,246. 325 vaccine operations have been performed during the year under report, of which 223 were primarily vaccinated and 102 revaccinated. The former consisted of 193 males and 28 females ; 85 hindús and 136 mohamed- ans ; 45 were under one year and 176 above it; the result was 207 successful, 2 unsuccessful and doubtful, and 14 unknown, and the percentage of success is 990. The result of the latter was 92 successful and 10 unknown, and the percentage of success 100. 2. There is a considerable increase of 291 in the number of persons vaccinated and revaccinated compared with the previous year ; this is chiefly owing to the adoption of special measures for securing the attendance of persons at the dispensary by me as well as to my taking the trouble to visit them at their own houses for the purpose of vaccinating. 3. The lymph during the year was fresh and good ; the vesicles appeared full and were of large pearly appearance, and the cicatrices were good in most of the cases. 4. No small-pox came under my notice nor the custom of inoculation. 5. No ill effect resulted from vaccination ROHRI DISPENSARY. Mr. Shaik Walí, 1st Class Hospital Assistant. Population 8,781. The number of children vaccinated was 303 and as compared with the pre- vious year there is a decrease of 234. This is chiefly owing to an order having been received on the 21st December last from the Superintendent of Vaccination in Sindh, to the effect that I should discontinue the performance of the operation till further orders, as also to strong objection and opposition on the part of the inhabitants of the town. 2. There were 174 male and 129 female children vaccinated; 193 were un- der and 110 above the age of one year. The number shown above comprises 133 hindús, 166 mahomedans and 4 other castes. The result in those primarily vacci- nated was 296 successful and 7 unknown.
67 3. The lymph was very good ; the vesicles appeared full and the cicatrices good. 4. No small-pox prevailed during the year, nor inoculation or other obstruc- tion to the spread of vaccination existed with the exception of the one mentioned in the first para. of this report. 5. No irregularities in the progress of the vaccine disease have occurred, nor have any ill effects resulted from vaccination. 6. No instance of small-pox occurred after unmistakeably successful vaccina- tion or after well marked previous small-pox. ADEN. Surgeon G. W. R. Hay, M.D., Acting Civil Surgeon. Population, 19,289. There has been an increase in the number of persons vaccinated during the past year of no less than 581 as compared with 1872-73. The number of cases in which the operation was successful is also greater by 386. The percentage of success is also higher, but is still, I think, much lower than it might be. The un- successful operations are, I am led to believe, principally among the Somalis, while among the Jews nearly every one succeeds ; this I think shows that it is not altogether the manner in which the operation is performed which influences the result. Many of the cases brought for inspection have the vesicles quite destroyed by the persons having scratched them about the fifth or sixth day. I have not been able to find out what sort of cicatrices result. The vesicles are also stated to have been good. Those I have seen during the last two months when not scratched have been typical. Lymph has been supplied during the year to the different regiments and I believe has given satisfaction. 2. At present vaccination is practised thrice a week, once in camp and the other two days at the Malla and Steamer Point.
68 Report on Re-vaccination by the Deputy Surgeon General, Puna Division of the Army. In conformity to the instructions contained in your letter No. 3198, dated the 12th September 1872, monthly returns of revaccination from 6 jails and 4 native regiments have been received, and the results are shown in a tabulated statement appended to this report. The experiments undertaken embrace a period of three months, and the total number of persons operated on is 249. Of these 76 were adults, bearing distinct traces of previous vaccination and 173 who showed equally traces of small-pox. Of the 76 persons operated on who had been previously vaccinated 17 or 22 per cent. proved successful. 52 or 67 per cent. were unsuccessful and in 7 the results are unknown. The results obtained from persons who had had small-pox were still more un- successful. Of the 173 vaccinated, only 41 or 23 per cent. were successful cases and 130 or 75 per cent. unsuccessful, leaving 2 in whom the results could not be ascertained as they left the jail very shortly after vaccination. The summary then of these experiments is as follows :69 Extract from the Report on Revaccination by the Deputy Surgeon General, Presidency Division of the Army. In the regimental hospitals 186 were revaccinated, the persons bearing marks of previous genuine vaccination ; out of these 41 cases were pronounced successful, that is the resulting vesicles were, 20 good, and 21 middling ; the remainder were followed by a few with badly formed vesicles and the larger number were unsuc- cessful. The percentage of success here is 22.04, excluding vesicles pronounced bad. 61 cases showing marks of small-pox were vaccinated ; in these, 26 cases were successfully operated on, that is 16 cases had good vesicles and 10 middling vesicles, the rest of the operations were followed by 10 bad vesicles and 25 with no success. The percentage of success here is so large as 42.62. Of 11 cases vac- cinated, which bore the distinctive inoculation mark on the front of the fore-arm, 2 were operated on with good vesicles resulting, 7 with middling results, and 2 were unsuccessful. The percentage here is 18.18. In jails :70 The percentages shown by the medical officer, Sappers and Miners, Madras, are 77.77, 78.57 and 65.67 respectively ; these results are, I am glad to say, not approached by the revaccinations performed in this division, which however appear to me, as regards vaccination, to point out the necessity of a most watchful care being taken in securing perfect lymph, from carefully selected vesi- cles ; for it had been observed by an authority that the protective power of vacci- nation has been &quot; impaired to an incalculable extent by imperfect vaccination&quot; ; and Jenner himself said that &quot; there may exist every gradation in the state of a pustule, from that slight deviation from perfection which is quite immaterial, up to that point which secures no protection at all.&quot; T.

72 REVACCINATIONS. RÁJKOT JAIL. In accordance with the instructions contained in the letter of the In- spector General, Indian Medical Department, No. 3215 of 1872, dated 13th of September last ; and also the recommendation contained in the letter No. 669 of 1872-73 of the Superintendent General of Vaccination, Bombay Presidency, dated 26th September 1872, I have the honour to forward herewith a detailed statement of revaccinations carried on among the prisoners at the Rajkot jail, the results of which I am satisfied by personal observation have been most carefully and diligently noted by 3rd Class Hospital Assistant Rámráo Jánú attached to the jail hospital. The total number of prisoners vaccinated was 70, of whom 46 were pro- tected by small-pox ; 8 were protected by previous vaccination and 16 by revaccination. It will thus be observed that not a single unprotected case was to be found among all the prisoners in the jail, a circumstance that speaks well for the careful and efficient manner in which vaccination has been per- formed in the province for some time ; although the fact that there were 46 prisoners who had small-pox previously, the great majority in their childhood, would tend to prove that inoculation is still widely practised among the peasantry of Káthewád. Of the 46 cases protected by small-pox, vaccination was successful in 26 cases or in the proportion of 56.52 per cent. ; unsuccessful in 13 cases or 28.26 per cent., and doubtful in 7 cases or 15.21 per cent. ; or in other words it was found that the number of successful cases was about double the number of the unsuccessful ; and nearly four times that of the doubtful cases. There were no doubtful cases in those previously vaccinated. Finally, as regards those cases, 16 in number, protected by revaccination only 2 or 12.5 per cent. were successful; whereas 14 or 87.5 per cent. were unsuccessful ; or in other words the successful cases were to the unsuccesful nearly in the proportion of 1 to 7. Revising the results of the foregoing experiments, if it be permitted to draw inferences from the figures above stated and if we are to regard suscep- tibility to vaccination as a measure of liability to the attacks of small-pox, it will be conceded that neither infant vaccination nor a previous attack of small-pox affords a very efficient protection against a subsequent attack ; and that the best hope of security would seem to lie in revaccination. I would, however, respectfully submit that the number of cases experimented on is hardly sufficient to warrant us in making deductions in any other than a tentative manner ; and that our duty lies rather in carefully noting and stating facts than in dogmatizing on what at best in the present state of our knowledge can be but a theory. I am at present conducting a further series of investigations into this most important and highly interesting subject, the results of which shall be duly laid before you and may it is to be hoped shed some further light upon what now seems obscure, and so enable us to correct inferences we may be disposed to draw too hastily from the facts and figures now presented to your notice.

73 KÁRWAR JAIL. An account of the vaccination of 136 inmates of Kárwár jail during the month of April 1874, tabulated according to the previous protection or otherwise of those operated on : the lymph was obtained from healthy infants and arm-to- arm vaccination was performed in each case. As regards the meanings of the terms applied to the results of the vaccina- tion : by &quot; Good&quot; is meant a large perfectly formed vesicle ; by &quot;fair&quot; is meant a large perfectly formed vesicle but smaller than the preceding ; both of these would be included under the head of successful vaccination: by &quot; Doubtful &quot; is meant those cases in which perhaps a small amount of lymph is formed but the vesicles have no definite shape and are very minute although there is a certain amount of inflammation round them; by the term &quot; Unsuccessful &quot; is meant, that there is nothing to be seen but the small puncture made by the lancet : the two latter classes have been taken both together as &quot;unsuccessful&quot;. Cases previously protected by both Small-pox and Vaccination Abbreviations : &quot; D &quot; means doubtful and &quot; U &quot; means unsuccessful. Number of persons. Character of small-pox marks.

BOMBAY: PRINTED AT THE GOVERNMENT CENTRAL PRESS.
Vaccination Report. No. 2473. GENERAL DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 27th August 1874. Letter from the Surgeon General, Indian Medical Department, No. 2085, dated 9th July 1874(2) primary vaccinations should be 99 per cent., there is evidently much room for improvement, especially in the army. 6. The returns still show a disparity between the number of males and females vaccinated. This is greatest in the city of Bombay, where the males number 55 per cent. of the whole. For the Presidency generally there are 52.8 males to 47.2 females vaccinated. The cause is propably to be found in the feelings and usages of Native Society. It is satisfactory to observe from a comparison of the results of previous years that there is a gradual decline in the excess of males. 7. The percentages of caste stand very much the same as in the reports of previous years. It is to be hoped that by the completion of the census it will become practicable in future years to show what proportion they bear to each section of the population ; but it is evident that some castes have greater prejudices than others against vaccination. The strongest opposition is experienced from the Lingayats in Dharwar, Sholapur and elsewhere, who object particularly to lymph being taken from the vaccinated child's arm. This difficulty might be successfully met by Dr. Turnbull's suggestion to the Barsi Municipality to introduce animal vaccination, being generally adopted. 8. There was an increase of Rs. 5,281-7-5 in the total expenditure during the year, owing principally to the increase of establishment. On the other hand there was a decrease of 6 pies in the cost of each successful vacci- nation, but it varies considerably in the different establishments, being as follows:(3) ren who might be primarily vaccinated. According to this calculation, nine- tenths of the number were vaccinated last year, which is a result highly credit- able to the Department. The average number of operations of each Vacci- nators was 1,652, being 146 more than that of the previous year. It was highest in Sind, and lowest in the Presidency Circle. 10. The least satisfactory general results are in the Southern Circle(4) 15. Government are glad to learn that their orders with respect to ex- aminations have been so promptly attended to, all the Superintendents but one, who is acting, having already passed in a vernacular language. They are also pleased to endorse the view of the Surgeon General with regard to the nature of the work done by the Department, and concur in the com- mendations bestowed on the Superintendent General, and Drs. Williams, Butler, Cody and Cola. Dr. Turnbull conducted the duties of Acting Superintendent General during the absence of Dr. Pinkerton to the entire satisfaction of Government. 16. It has been suggested by the Army Sanitary Commission that the Vaccination Establishment should be associated with the Sanitary Establish- ment, and in this opinion Government are disposed to concur. As long as at present the Sanitary Commissioner's duties are mainly limited to the com- pilation of vital statistics of more than doubtful reliability, but insignificant practical results can be looked for. What is wanted is periodical personal inspection of the large Towns; and as far as possible personal supervision over the preparation of the Returns of vital statistics. The existing very com- plete organization of the Vaccination Department, with an Assistant Super- intendent for each Collectorate, a Superintendent over each Circle, and a Superintendent General over the whole, affords, in the opinion of His Excel- lency the Governor in Council, the best means of securing these important ends. Authority might also be given with advantage to the Vaccination officers to inspect the village Registers of Births. 17. Government are glad to observe that the assistance given to the Department by Civil and Political Officers is duly acknowledged. Their countenance and support are essential to success. 18. The plan introduced by Dr. Pinkerton for the first time of giving in his report a separate sketch of the operations in each Collectorate is very convenient. His suggestion too in respect to maps is valuable, and he is authorized to apply to the Survey Commissioners for as many copies of both Taluka and District Maps as he may require for the use of the Department.

REPORT ON VACCINATION THROUGHOUT THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY AND SIND FOR THE YEAR 1874-75. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Bombay: PRINTED AT THE GOVERNMENT CENTRAL PRESS. 1875.
REPORT ON VACCINATION THROUGHOUT THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY AND SINDNo. 2542 A. To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, GENERAL DEPARTMENT. Bombay, 14th June 1875. SIR, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Gov- ernor in Council and Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India, the Annual Report on Vaccination in this Presidency and Sindh for the year 1874-75. 2. Briefly, there is progress in all respects. The number of vaccinations are 80,401 more than in the preceding year; the success is higher, the cost of each successful case less, and the conduct of the vaccinators has been satisfactory. 3. The strength of the Department shows 8 more vaccina- tors than in the preceding year; in other respects there was no change. 4. Dr. Pinkerton describes the Bombay System of vaccination as reorganized in 1871, and says no change either in it or in the constitution of the Circles took place last year; that as far as he can see the system is perfect in theory, and in its application it has realized his best hopes. The work of the year bears out this statement. 5. The total number of persons vaccinated and re-vaccinated were 732,624, being an increase of 80,401, and this increase is chiefly owing to increased exertions of all the officers and vaccinators of the Department. The itinerant vaccinators of the Local Funds establish- ment contribute 59,605 of the increase and the Native States' vac- cinators 20,325 ; the rest is by Municipal and by the 2 Govern- ment vaccinators. There was a decrease in the army, which appears to be due to want of subjects. 6. The primary vaccinations were 671,089, and the re-vac- cinations 60,807; the latter were chiefly in Sindh, where there were 48,504. No attempt has been made to push re-vaccination anywhere but in Sindh; because in the other Circles the vaccinators have enough to do to get through their primary vaccinations. By and by more attention will, I hope, be given to re-vaccination in the other circles; Sindh has set the example of what can be done. B 99( 2 ) 7.I am glad to observe that the disparity in the sexes is again less, and that it is now probably pretty correct in general, but it is very much too high in Aden and Sindh. 8.The percentages of castes differ from the census, but this is reported to be due to the method of registering the low caste Hindus. As there is, Dr. Pinkerton thinks, some inclination on the part of high caste Hindu vaccinators to avoid contact with the Sudras, it is considered the vaccination columns for castes are very suitable for the purpose of preventing them being left unpro- tected. It is shown that the Musalmans accept vaccination more freely than Hindus, and this is in accord with the general experience of the Department; but the city of Bombay forms a Striking contrast to this almost universal rule. 9.One of the best signs of progress in this report is the fact of there having been 294,841 infantile vaccinations, which is an in- crease of 55,098 over the preceding year. Since the re-organization of 1871 these have increased by one hundred thousand, and in this report they stand at 43.9 per cent. on the total number of persons operated on. This is a very high percentage for itinerant vac- cinators to reach. I note that the infantile vaccinations are again highest in the Presidency Circle and lowest in the Southern Circle of all British Circles; but I am pleased to see that the Southern Circle, though still the lowest, is 6 per cent. higher than in the last report. 10. There were 635,254 primary vaccinations, and in them the successful was 96.4 per cent., which is 1.6 higher than in the preceding year. It was highest in Sindh, and lowest in the Presi- dency Circle of all British Circles; but the lowest is only 3.2 less than the highest. This is considered a very satisfactory rate of success for an itinerating establishment, such as ours is, to reach. The re-vaccinations numbered 60,807 ; of these 48,504 were in the Sindh Circle, and of the total 45,618 were successful, or a percentage of 80 .8. This is 15.1 higher than in the previous year. The percentage in the army returns, however, was 44.6, and it is considered that the army rate is probably, the Superintendent General considers, the most correctly noted. 11. On our population of over twenty-five millions, as shown by the census, Dr. Pinkerton calculates that, with a birth-rate of fully 40 per mille, there might be about 850,000 persons primarily vaccinated per annum, after writing off 18 per cent. of the births for still-born, deaths, those having small-pox and those escaping the vaccinators. On this calculation, the Department vaccinated eight-tenths of the available children last year. This must be viewed with much satisfaction, and I fully endorse the words of the
( 3 ) Superintendent General, that &quot; nothing but the utmost devotion to their duty could obtain such a result &quot; by the officers and vac- cinators of the Department. There were 26.7 per mille of the population primarily vaccinated last year, but the Depart- ment should aim at 33 per mille if the birth-rate be as high as it has been computed to be by Surgeon-Major Lumsdaine in the Census Report. The rate of vaccinations per mille of population ranges from 39.1 in Sindh to 19.3 in the Presidency Circle. It is certain, however, that the birth-rate of a city like Bombay can not be anything like 40 per mille; it is probably not over 25, as stated by the Superintendent General in his report of last year ; so that 19.3 in Bombay city is positively higher than 21.7 in the Southern Circle. On the whole returns it is shown that there were successfully vaccinated in British territory 26.9 per mille and in Native States 22.3. 12. The lymph degenerated for a short time in three Circles, viz., Eastern Gujarath, Western Gujarath, and Sindh, but was promptly renewed. The lymph which was received from England succeeded in five Circles, and was unsuccessful in two; sufficient was, however, obtained to multiply to any extent required. An- imal vaccination was practised in Bombay, Poona and Barsi. The cow-lymph in Bombay was abundant and good, and the success resulting from its use was higher than in any previous year. This is of special use in Bombay, where of all places it has been found next to impossible to induce parents to bring their children to give lymph for further vaccinations. 13. The expenditure from all sources was Rs. 2,20,663, of which Government contributed about half. This is an increase of Rs. 4,580 over 1873-74. Government contributed of this increase about one-half, and the other half was provided by Native States, local and municipal funds. The cost of each successful case was 5 annas and 4 pies, or 10 pies less than in the preceding year. A memorandum is now before Government, in which Dr. Pinkerton shows how a portion of the vaccine expenditure ought to be debited to general sanitation. 14. The Superintendents and their Assistants inspected 47 per cent. of the persons operated on, without discovering any falsi- fications in the registers of the vaccinators in British territory; but I regret to observe that Dr. Blomfield, in Kathewad, discover- ed ten instances of this very serious offence, and Dr. Raby reports another in the Kolhapur State. The Superintendent General is of opinion that the practice is now very limited ; it cannot escape the searching tests to which the registers are subjected.
( 4 ) 15.It is to be regretted that vaccination is still so back- ward in Kutch, and that it is so costly. The supervision there and in Gaikawadi territory appears to be really nil, and I concur with the Superintendent General in thinking these Circles should be joined to the two Gujarath circles, and supervised by Drs. Cola and Blomfield. 16.Inoculation is reported to have been practised in 3 vil- lages in Mahad taluka and in the Thar Parkar, but in both in- stances to a very small extent. As a matter of fact, the inoculator cannot compete with the vaccinator; still it is probable, as Dr. Pinkerton says, inoculation will not entirely cease until all the old inoculators are dead. 17.Dr. Williams brought to notice a &quot;false vaccinator.&quot; A man went about in the Thar and Parkar pretending to vaccinate by making punctures, but had no lymph; the people paid him for the operation. This shows what a firm hold vaccination has on the people of Sindh. The man was prosecuted and convicted. 18.In regard to vaccino-syphilis, the Superintendent General says not a single instance has yet come to light of syphilis having been communicated by vaccination to any person in this Presidency, notwithstanding every effort on the part of the officers of the De- partment to discover any such case; and their experience in this matter extends to over a million and a quarter of observations. 19.The Superintendent General's tour was an extensive one, including Sindh, the Dekkan and Konkan; the only part not visited was Gujarath. 20.The tours of Superintendents appear to have been exten- sive and judiciously arranged. I observe, however, that Palanpur districts had not been visited by the Superintendent of the Western Gujarath Circle in the last two years. Dr. Blomfield says he found so much to do in Kathewad itself, that he could not find time. I am of opinion that this district ought to have a Native Assistant Superintendent who should be paid by the Chiefs. 21.As regards small-pox, the year 1874-5 was a non-epidemic one, and the recorded deaths stand at 3,903 only, and of these it is known that some were incorrectly returned as having died of small-pox, when in reality many died of measles and other diseases. The deaths in the two preceding years were 9,946 and 26,699. If the returns are not quite correct, still they show this disease to be much less last year than in the two preceding it. I am afraid the statistics of births and deaths in this Presidency are at present of very little value, though it is cheering to know they are improving.
( 5 ) If Government adopts Dr. Pinkerton's suggestion to give the village returns into the hands of the officers of the Vaccination Department for compilation as well as inspection, I feel sure that in a very few years fairly correct figures would be obtained of immensely more value than the very doubtful ones at present recorded. 22.The progress shown by districts is very interesting. Belgaum is still the backward zilha, but there an increase of 3 vac- cinators will improve matters. It is very evident that in some of the larger talukas more than one vaccinator is required, and I am glad to see the Superintendent General is gradually obtaining and plac- ing a second where necessary. 23.The work of the officers of the Department in the past year is in every respect highly satisfactory, and I have much plea- sure in commending to the favourable notice of Government Drs. Williams and Cody, as named by the Superintendent General. Although I mention these names only, yet I most gladly put on record my entire satisfaction with the work in all British Circles in the past year. The conduct of the Assistant Superintendents and vaccinators has also been satisfactory. Each vaccinator on an average vaccinated 1,828 persons, or 176 more than in the preced- ing year, which, taken in conjunction with the higher rate of success and lower rate of cost, is very creditable, indeed, to the Department, so well and ably conducted by the Superintendent General, who I would beg specially to commend to the favourable notice of Gov- ernment, as I fully believe, to produce such results as are here shown, the guiding hand must possess a great amount of tact to ensure the harmonious working of so large a Department in a manner so satisfactory. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, W. THOM, F.R.C.S.L., Surgeon General.

This is the seventh annual report by the Superintendent General of Vac- cination. It is somewhat different from former ones, as Government have issued orders not to print the circle superintendents' reports, but to embody the substance of them in this one. This report will show : 1st, a general view of the working of the depart- ment as a whole ; 2nd, the progress of vaccination in each district; and 3rd, the tables of figures, showing the number of vaccinations, cost, &c. Constitution of circles. 2. There was no change in the constitution of the circles during the year, and they remain as described in last year's re- port at page ii; but it has recently been recommend- ed that the circles of vaccination be made uniform with the sanitary registra- tion divisions, which, if sanctioned by Government, will be convenient for working, and also for making comparisons between the progress of vaccina- tion and the number of deaths from small-pox, &c. I may here notice that Her Majesty's Secretary of State has sanctioned the creation of a superintendent of vaccination for the Western Gujarath circle, and a transfer of Rs. 7,000 from Imperial to Provincial Service has been made for this purpose ; hitherto the civil surgeon of Rájkot has also been superintendent of vaccination, but the two appointments can now be separated. Strength of the department. 3. The following table shows the strength of the department, by cir- cles, as it existed at the close of the year, and as compared with the preceding year.

3 Bombay system of vaccination. 4. There has been no change made in our system of working, and the principles laid down by Government have been strictly adhered to. The &quot; Bombay System of Vaccination&quot; may be described in very few words :4 on the eighth day after having been vaccinated. The peons add consider- ably to the cost of our system ; although at present I do not see how we could do without them, still I think it may be reasonably expected that at some future time the vaccinator will be able to work without a peon. 7th. Over the whole department there is the Superintendent General, who is under the control of the Surgeon General of the Indian Medical Department. 5. This &quot; Bombay System of Vaccination &quot;, as reorganized in 1871, is, as far as I can see, perfect in theory, and in its application it has realized my best and highest hopes5 Udaipur : the former at the end of the year, and the latter at the beginning of the year 1875-76. Besides the increases which took place during the year under report, I have to notice a further increase at the commencement of the year 1875-76 of 3 local fund vaccinators in Belgáum collectorate: 1 in Násik for the new táluká of Kulwan, and a second vaccinator for the very large táluká of Dhanduká in Ahmadábád zilhá. Work of the year is the largest ever attained. 7. The past year's work shows not only the largest amount of work ever done in a year, but also the largest increase that has ever been obtained in any one year. It gives me much pleasure to be able to say that the increase is distributed over the whole country, though, as might be expected, the actual rate of increase differs a good deal in the different circles ; but there is a very considerable increase of work where it was most desired6 zealous way in which the superintendents themselves have carried on their duty. The increased number of vaccinators (8) has helped only a very little to swell the increase. I here show the increase in the number of vaccinations, as compared with the previous year, in each establishment:7 Sindh ... 48,504 Southern ... 2,810 Western Gujarath ... 2,614 Eastern do. ... 1,759 Presidency ... 1,562 Native Army ... 1,430 Central ... 942 Western ... 933 Baroda ... 173 Aden ... 67 Kutch ... 9 Muscat ... 4 Total re-vaccinations... 60,807 There has been no attempt made to push re-vaccination, except perhaps in Sindh, because in most of the other circles the vaccinators have found quite enough to do to carry out primary vaccination; but I think a little more attention must now be given to this subject. Percentages. 15. The percentages of sex, caste, age and result can be shown for primary vaccinations in all establishments except the British Army, but for re-vaccinations the percentage can only be shown for the result of the operations. Sex. 16. There are only two columns for entering the sexes, and they show the sexes at all ages only8 Males. Females. Census 19 for Musalmans, 0.18 for Parsis, and 7.15 for all Other Castes combined. Arranged in the way shown by the census this would give :10 Ages. Progress of infantile vaccination. 20. There are two columns in the vaccination returns to enter the ages of those who are vaccinated. The 1st column is for all &quot; under 1 year old &quot; and the 2nd column for all &quot; above 1 year old &quot;. Exclusive of the British Army returns there were 294,841 under one year old and 376,248 above that age. This gives an increase of 55,098 infantile vaccinations over the preceding year and an increase of 219,686 as compared with the year 1857. The following figures,taken from previous annual reports, but corrected to show the number also vaccinated under 1 year old at dispensaries and in the Native Army, show how infantile vaccination has progressed in the past 18 years :11 In the Native Army ... 83.9 12 columns. I mentioned in my previous report that it is very difficult to define exactly what success is in re-vaccinations, and personally I do not think these figures are of any exact value as statistics. They are so far of value that they show a large number of persons have been protected who had only a very doubtful protection before submitting to the operation of the so- called re-vaccination. Experience may yet show that re-vaccinations are more successful than has been generally supposed13 From these figures it will be observed that as regards primary vaccina- tions in circles, Sindh again has the highest success, and the Presidency and Western circles the lowest; but by circles the lowest is only 3.2 less than the highest. It is with much pleasure I note the improvement in the success here as compared with last year. The percentage of success in primary vaccinations is very satisfactory indeed, and as regards its general correctness there can hardly be any doubt, because a very large proportion of the vac- cinated persons have been seen by the supervising officers of the department. As regards the success in re-vaccinations the Army is the lowest, except Kutch, where there were only a very few re-vaccinations altogether ; and as the results are noted in the Army by qualified medical officers, they are much more reliable than the other figures. 27. It may be as well here to show also the resulting success of the operations as performed by the different establishments :14 rate ranged from 7.9 to 30.5, the highest rate being in Liverpool district. Again, the English Life Table gives the death-rate in the first year of life at 16.6 per cent. from 2 to 5 years 2.6 15 actual protection afforded. I have again to notice that the protection varies very much in the different circles as shown below :16 assistant superintendents speak also the same language. The vesicles and cicatrices were good and perfect in type as a rule, exceptionally some cicatrices were seen to be less marked than desirable. The English lymph was success- ful and was distributed here and there. Lymph in Southern circle. 3rd. In the Southern circle the lymph seen by Dr. Raby was excellent, &quot; producing large and well-defined vesicles for the most part,&quot; and his assistants generally reported it good. English lymph succeeded and was distributed. Lymph deteriorated in Kolhápur and was replaced by English lymph. Lymph in Western circle. 4th. In the Western circle Dr. Cody says :17 Lymph in the Sindh circle. 7th. In the Sindh circle Dr. Williams says :18 49 tubes of English lymph were used; 55 children were operated on ; 282 insertions were made, and there resulted 34 good and 10 imperfect vesicles. The success cannot be considered as good as desirable ; but it gave a supply of English lymph, which once started we could multiply to any extent required. Whence received.

19 33. Supplies of lymph were sent to Bassadore in the Persian Gulf, to Muscat in Arabia, to the Central Provinces, and in short to all applicants. Animal vaccination. Animal vaccination in Barsi. 34. The practice of inoculating calves with cow-lymph has been con- tinued in Bombay throughout the year. It is much appreciated by the people, and by the abundant sup- ply of good lymph which it gives it greatly facilitates the operations of the Presidency circle. The practice has also been continued in Poona under the health officer, but I have received no report from him for the past year. The practice has been introduced into Barsi town, and was practised for the greater part of the year. The municipality granted a small sum to cover the cost. Dr. Turnbull was of opinion that animal vaccination might over- come the objection of the Lingayat Wanis. He thought they do not accept vaccination, because they fear the lymph will be taken from their children's vesicles. The cost has been Rs. 47-11-6 for the 25 calves used. The percentage of success appears to be only 78 per cent. There were only 247 persons vaccinated with cow-lymph, and 399 with human lymph in a population of 18,560; so there has been progress, but I cannot speak very warmly of the percentage of success, which appears to be only 75 in vaccinations with cow-lymph here. I made an effort also to introduce the practice into Sholapur, but the municipality passed the following resolution on my letter:20 shown below. The increase in the Government establishment has been kept down by my holding charge of the Central circle. Establishments. Total expenditure. Compared with the preceding year. Increase. Decrease.

It is a pleasing feature in the above expenditure that native states, municipalities and local funds together have increased their expenditure in about the same rate as Government. In a paper now before Government I have shown how the vaccination charges ought to be considerably reduced by debiting a portion of the superintending charges to sanitation, because the supervising officers now are health officers as well as superintendents of vaccination. Cost of each successful vaccination, excluding the pay of superintendents. 38. The cost of each successful vaccination is considerably influenced by the pay of the superintendent. In the Western Gujarath, Baroda and Kutch circles the cost of super- intendence is much less than in the other circles, because the superintendents hold other substantive appointments from which nearly the whole of their pay is drawn, and again, the cost has been less than usual in the Central circle, owing to my having charge of it in addition to my duties of superintendent general. The pay of a superintendent may also vary in different circles according to rank and length of service. This quantity is, therefore, such a variable one that in comparing the cost of each successful case in one circle with another, it should be excluded. I have, therefore, excluded it from the following table, and also the cost of the four army vaccinators, because they do a great many vaccinations in regiments which do not appear in these four vaccinators' own returns:21 Cost of each successful vaccination including all charges. Vaccination is again dearest in Kutch, but each successful vaccination was less than in the preceding year by one anna and seven pies. I wish I could add that it is as good as it is dear. But I fear it is just the reverse. Vaccination in Bombay city is the next most expensive; but here it is good, and I do not think it ever can be as cheap in a large city as in the coun- try districts. The cost in the rest of the circles does not vary very much, but the Western is the highest a little, and Sindh the lowest. The general average cost of each successful vaccination, after excluding the pay of the superintendents, was 3 annas and 11 pies, or 7 pies less than was shown in the previous report; but, including all charges, it was 5 annas and 4 pies,or 10 pies less than in the proceeding year. Although the average cost of each successful vaccination has been nearly one anna reduced, still I am afraid our cost is high as compared with other provinces in India; but I do not think it is now too high for the work done, and for the surety that it is well done. It may still be reduced a little by the further extension of vaccination. Inspections by the offi- cers of the department 39. What I have already written affords conclusive evidence that all the officers who have been working with me in the department last year have exerted themselves in a way that I cannot speak too highly of. When I say I am entirely satisfied, I express in terse and plain language what 1 mean ; but if anything more be required, the figures below prove how active and energetic all have been :22 Cola, Blomfield, Raby and Williams inspected the greatest number of vacci- nated children. Two methods of test- ing the correctness of the returns. 40. There are two methods of testing the vaccinators' work : one is by calling over the names of the vaccinated children and seeing one by one that the entries in all the columns of the vaccination registers have been correctly filled up, as regards name, sex, caste, age and results ; the second method is by collecting as many children as can be got together without much inconvenience to the people, and ascertaining the character of the vesicles or vaccine marks on their arms. The first method is, of course, by far the best, but it cannot always be done in large towns such as Poona, Dharwad, and many others. However in these towns most of the civil surgeons or dispensary officers see the vaccinator's work weekly, and this guards against falsification to an extent that may be accepted as sufficient. In the above table I have shown the total number of children inspected by superintendents. I now show below the number inspected by the first or better method of calling over the names from the vaccinators' registers :23 will be so too. If there be any cause not to be so, it is in the one matter of the degeneration of the lymph during a small portion of the year, in parts of Drs. Cola, Blomfield and Williams' circles; but these officers, with their usual promptness, speedily replaced the less active lymph by pure vaccine virus. Commendation of superintendents. 42. It has been customary to commend two or three of the most deserving officers of the department in the annual report; but when all have done so well, it is very difficult for me to perform this duty. However, as it must be done, I would beg to commend to the favourable notice of Govern- ment Drs. Williams and Cody; and I must not forget to notice the progress which Dr. Raby has made in the Southern circle. I cannot close this paragraph without noticing the long connection of Drs. Butler and Turnbull with this department, which has been severed, for at least a time, and probably, in both cases, permanently. Dr. Butler in Kathewád and Dr. Turnbull in the Central circle have earned reputations that will not be soon forgotten in the vaccination department. Total number of children inspected. 43. The assistant superintendents inspected the vaccinators' work mostly by the best method of calling over the names of the vaccinated children. They tested 267,239 nominal entries in the vaccinators' registers. In no instance in British territory were any falsifications detected. Inspections 47 per cent. of total operations. 44. The inspections of superintendents and assistant superintendents combined numbered 341,844, or fully 47 per cent. of the total operations of the year; and with the exceptions of the few falsifications detected byDr. Blomfield in Kathewád and by Dr. Raby in one instance in Kolhapurstate, no falsifications were noticed. Falsifications cannot escape our testings ;but it is very much more to our credit to prevent falsifications than to findthem out. Conduct of the assis- tant superintendents. 45. The assistant superintendents as a body have given great satis- faction. One, who was acting on probation in Sindh circle, was found guilty of conniving at the absence of one of his vaccinators from his taluka,and was reverted to his former position of a vaccinator. Four of the best of them having served 3 years in the lowest grade, and having given entire satisfaction, were promoted to 2nd Class, and a fifth was also promoted on 1st May 1875. In my previous report it was stated that the only circle in which the assistant superintendents did not give entire satisfaction, was the Southern; but even there I am glad to be able to say that Dr. Raby in his report says they have done better. Dr. Blomfield has had reason not to be pleased with two of his assistants; one of whom he reports as wanting in intelligence and inattentive to orders, and the other was fined a month's pay for having taken a loan and supplies from one of his vaccinators. Both these men are marked, and if it be necessary they will be degraded to the position they formerly held before being appointed assistant superintendents. 46. Thus far I have reviewed the work of the department as a whole. I will now briefly show the work done by the different circles, next by establishments, and finally the progress made in each district of this Presi- dency.
24 Operations of the differ- ent circles. 47. There has been an increase in the number of vaccinations in all circles. Aden and Muscat are entered here for the sake of the total, but they are not circles in any sense ; they are merely towns. In Aden only is there a decrease. The following figures show the increase in each circle :25 Causes of decreases in municipal vaccinators' work. The decrease in the Central circle is owing to the abolition of the vacci- nators in the towns of Walwa, Karhad and Narayan- gaon. The decrease in the Eastern Gujarath circle is attributed by Dr. Cola to the lymph deterioratingin Surat city. The decrease in Sindh circle is due to the reduction of onevaccinator in Karáchi town. Causes of increases in municipal vaccinators work. The increase in the Presidency and Southern circles is due to an increase in the number of vaccinators. In the Western and Western Gujarath circles the increase is due apparently to the increased activity of the vaccinators themselves, which Dr. Cody, for his circle, says is the result of increased supervision by the assistant superin- tendents. Average vaccinations by each municipal vacci- nator. The average number of persons operated on by each municipal vacci- nator was 1,176, which is 652 less than the average for the whole presidency. This is not surprising, because the spheres of the municipal vaccinators are more limited than the other vaccinators have. The percentage of success in primary vaccinations is 95.9, or 3.0 higher than in the previous report. The cost of each successful vaccination is four annas and seven pies, or seven pies less than in 1873-74. Work of the local fund establishment. 50. The number of local fund vaccinators was 203, or 1 more than before, and he was appointed in Kanada zilhá. These men operated on 427,658 persons, or 59,605 more than in the previous year. This immense increase is due to the greater activity of the vaccinators, to their using the birth registers to find out where the unprotected are and how many children there are avail- able for vaccination, to the close supervision of the assistant superintendents, and to the zeal and ability of the superintendents of circles. The following figures show the increase in each circle :26 in re-vaccinations was 84.2. The cost of each successful case was 2 annas 4 pies, or 6 pies less than last year. The work of the 129 native states' vacci- nators. 51. The native states of this presidency maintained 129 vaccinators, or four more than in the previous year. The increase of vaccinators was one in Bhor, one in Sangli, one in Janjira, and one in Gondal. The number of persons vaccinated was 211,656, which gives an average of 1,640 to each vaccinator. The percentage of success was 95.9 in primary and 73.9 in re-vaccinations. Each successful vaccination cost three annas and one pie, or two pies less than in last report. The increase by circles is here shown :27 in the year, and as the number is limited the choice of vaccinifers is also limi- ted. By circles the increases and decreases in dispensary vaccinations are :28 56. In the Eastern Gujarath circle there is a special peon at each of the dispensaries of Anklesar and Sádrá; a dispensary peon at Borsad, Mahmudábád, Mahudá and Godhra; and at all the others the aid of a municipal peon or some other local official is obtained on vaccination days. Dr. Cola thinks the aid given at Balsád, Rándir, Jambusar, and Borsad, is not sufficient; but after a trial for a year or two, we will know exactly whether it is so or not. 57. In the Western Gujarath circle the dispensaries have each a peon. 58. In Sindh Dr. Williams thinks a special peon is an unnecessary expense, and he has made arrangements for the dispensary officers being assisted by existing local officials, viz., Kotwal's peon, Mukhtiarkar's peons, municipal peons or dispensary peons. At only one dispensary, viz., Manorá, there is no aid, and as there are only about twenty vaccinations a year there, Dr. Williams does not think any special aid necessary. Army vaccinations. 59. There was a decrease of 824 in the number of vaccinations in the Army in the year 1873-74, and again in this year's report there is a falling off of 2,074. As far as I can see, it appears to be due to want of subjects, as I have already stated. Average number of vaccinations by each vaccinator for the whole department. 60. For the whole presidency the average number of vaccinations by each vaccinator is 1,828, or 176 more than in the preceding year. The four Army vaccinators are excluded from this calculation, because a good deal of their work is returned in regimental returns. By establishments the average of each vaccinator's work is as follows :29 The high average in Sindh is due to the very large number of re- vaccinations. Dr. Williams deserves great credit for having attained such a very high average. The Western Gujarath, Central and Eastern Gujarath circles have very good averages. Some improvement may be looked for in the Western and Southern circles. Baroda circle has room for great ex- tension. In the Presidency circle I can hardly promise a much higher num- ber of vaccinations than was reached in the year under report. In Kutch there is room for so great an extension that one might truly say the vacci- nator has hardly begun to work in Kutch. Conduct of vaccinators. 62. The conduct of the vaccinators, as a body, has been, I think, un- usually good. In the Presidency circle they &quot; gene- rally conducted themselves well.&quot; In the Central circle the vaccinators have all behaved well. In the Western circle &quot; the general conduct of the vaccinators has been good, though there are still &quot; one or two men in Khandesh with whom I am far from satisfied.&quot; Dr. Cody here alludes to the manner of working rather than to the personal character of one or two of his men. Dr. Cola says that in Eastern Gujarath circle, with a few exceptions, their general conduct was good, but during the year he fined 15 vaccinators &quot; chiefly for culpable negligence and working with &quot; bad lymph, &c.&quot; In the Western Gujarath circle Dr. Blomfield says : &quot; I &quot; regret that I cannot report favourably of their conduct generally ; of the 27 &quot; whose work I inspected, only seven or eight gave me full satisfaction. The &quot; principal faults were disobedience of orders, working with bad lymph, &quot; neglecting to report small-pox, and falsifying their register ; ten having &quot; been convicted of the last offence. &quot; One man was dismissed, and four suspended for a time. &quot; With a view of enforcing attention to my orders and the proper per- &quot; formance of their duty generally, I inflicted fines for which there is &quot; in Kathewád a peculiar facility, as an extra Rs. 5 a month under the name &quot; of batta is granted by the Chiefs to those of the vaccinators whose conduct &quot; has satisfied the superintendent during the past six months; the batta &quot; being paid at that interval.&quot; It appears to me to be utterly wrong to merely fine a vaccinator for falsifying. It is a crime, and if a vaccinator be not prosecuted for the crime, he should certainly be dismissed the service. I hold that no superin- tendent ought to condone a crime by a fine. Falsification no longer dis- graces the department in British territory, and it ought to be wiped out of native states too. With a view to this I directed Dr. Blomfield to issue a circular for the purpose of informing all the Chiefs' vaccinators in Kathewád, that any one found falsifying his register will be either prosecuted or dis- missed the service. Dr. Blanc and Colonel Anderson achieved a great deal when they got the Chiefs to subscribe to a vaccination fund; and now I think we are bound to see that the vaccinators paid from that fund shall not give false returns. Dr. Williams says of the vaccinators in his circle :30 Clerks... Dismissed ... ... ... 2 Government servants. Resigned and discharged ... 0 Truthfulness of the returns. 63. The inspections of the superintendents and their assistants give ample testimony to the truthfulness of the vacci- nators' returns in British territory. In native states there have been ten instances of falsifications report- ed by Dr. Blomfield in Kathewád. About the beginning of the current year (1875-76), the Gadinglaj vaccinator in Kolhapur native state was dismissed for falsifications. But as far as I can make out in both circles the falsifi- cations were to a very limited extent. The returns even of most native states appear to be fairly correct, but I will not vouch in any way for the returns from Baroda and Kutch, where there is no real supervision at all. The practice of inoculating with small- pox virus. 64. The practice of inoculating with the virus of small-pox has been said to be, by several writers, of ancient date in India, but there is no real evidence of its practice previous to the Mahomedan invasion. Within my own recollection the practice was common in this presi- dency ; now, it has all but ceased. The inoculator has been driven to the wall by the vaccinator without the necessity of any legal penalty or even restriction ; this is a first-rate testimony to vaccination : but it is probable that inoculation will not be quite abandoned until the old practitioners have died out of the land. Dr. Cody mentions in his report that inoculated small-pox had been introduced into three villages of the Mahad táluká, and adds that, owing to the Kolábá collectorate being so well vaccinated, the disease did not spread. Two inoculators were also detected in Thar Parkar district, one a native of the dis- trict, and the other from Jodpur state. Dr. Williams states that the practice in Kutch has been the means of keeping up small-pox there for the last few years, but the report from Kutch makes no mention of this. Speaking of the small- pox in Kolábá zilhá, Dr. Cody says : &quot; I can fully account for how a portion &quot; of this small-pox had its origin, and if I detail in full here the circumstances, &quot; it is only to use them as an argument in favour of the introduction of &quot; prohibitory measures against inoculation. In the course of the year the &quot; vaccinator for the Mahád táluká, and Mr. Mahádeo Vináyak, the assistant &quot; superintendent for Kolábá, both reported to me the presence of small-pox in &quot; three villages of the Mahád táluká, viz., Chandwe, Parle and Selwade, at the &quot; same time stating the origin of the disease was with some children who were &quot; inoculated. The assistant superintendent stated in his report that he had &quot; personally seen the children and found the marks of inoculation on their left &quot; forearms31 &quot; list of callings endangering the safety of the public health for the prohibi- &quot; tion of which the Penal Code provides is more than I can understand ! It &quot; appears to me to be the one calling against which the section could be en- &quot; forced with most effect, for its danger is manifest; and it is entirely owing &quot; to the efficient way in which Kolábá is protected that such danger did not &quot; make itself a startling notoriety by imperilling the lives of thousands.&quot; A false vaccinator in Sindh. 65. Dr. Williams mentions in his report that a false vaccinator has been detected in the practice of deceiving some villagers by making them believe he was a vaccinator. This is a most extraordinary testimony to the hold vaccina- tion has acquired on the people of Sindh, and I note it accordingly and add Dr. Williams' own words. He says :32 He is devoted to his work and carries it on to my entire satisfaction. I did not visit the Gujarath circles. In my tour as officiating superintendent of vaccination of the Central circle, I went through the zilhás of Poona, Sholapur, Satara, and Ratnagiri. Ahmadnagar zilhá alone was not visited, but it was very carefully gone over by Dr. Turnbull in the preceding year. Tours of superintendents of circles. Dr. Raby's tour. Dr. Cody's tour. Dr. Cola's tour. Dr. Blomfield's tour. 68. In my former reports I never said much about the tours made by the superintendents of circles because generally the tour or a resume of it was printed in each superin- tendent's own report; but this year I must notice this very important subject, as the superintendents' reports are not to be printed. It would, however, make this part of my report too long were I to extract the whole of the tours from all the superintendents' reports ; I will therefore only take the pith of each. I have already given my own tour in the capacity of superintendent of the Central circle. In the Southern circle Dr. Raby visited all his collectorates except Kanada, which he had just gone through at the end of the preceding year. He visited and inspected the work of all the Belgaum and Kaladgi vaccinators, most of the native states' vaccinators, and some of the Dharwad and Kanada vaccinators. Dr. Cody says of his tour :33 &quot; districts of Talájá, Mowá, Jafrábád, Una and Viráwal; in each I found there &quot; had been much small-pox during the previous year and that it was still pre- &quot; vailing in Jafrábad, where the vaccinator denied its existence, although I &quot; found cases in the village in which he was residing. I found it also in Una &quot; and Viráwal to a small extent though the virulence of the epidemic had &quot; abated. &quot; The work in these five districts was bad, and the returns false, with &quot; the exception of Mowá, where that which I inspected was well done and the &quot; register correct. &quot;At Viráwal I was attacked by sunstroke on the 27th of May and was &quot; unable to travel until the 10th of June, when I started for Rájkot inspecting &quot; en route parts of the districts of Junágad, Jaitpur and Gondal dispensary, in &quot; all of which the work was indifferent. I arrived at Rájkot on the 20th of &quot; June. &quot; On the 5th November, I started again posting through Bhownagar to &quot; attend the thakur, who was sick. I there inspected the work of Lal Sing, &quot; who had been lately appointed, and found it satisfactory ; but small-pox had &quot; recently appeared in the town. &quot; I then returned to the Jasdan district where the work was good. I &quot; discovered twelye cases of small-pox in one village and sent for the vacci- &quot; nator. &quot; In Botád some of the work was good, and the cicatrices from English &quot; lymph, introduced last year by Dr. Butler, some of the best I have ever seen ; &quot; the vaccinator, however, had neglected parts of his district for three years &quot; and his register was false ; as he had been previously discharged by Dr. &quot; Blanc for the same offence but re-appointed, he was dismissed the service. &quot; In Saela the work was middling and the register incorrect. &quot; In Wakaner the work was carelessly done and the register wilfully &quot; falsified. &quot;I then returned to Rájkot, finding in the district of the station vacci- &quot; nator that many of the children in his register had not been vaccinated by &quot; him, but by candidates who were placed with him for instruction. Having &quot; been directed by the superintendent general to inspect the district of &quot; Sanand in the Ahmadábád collectorate, in which the vaccinator was suspend- &quot; ed for charges brought against him by Assistant Superintendent Sardarmia, &quot; who also said the man was infirm and unfit for further service, I started on &quot; the 15th of January, passing through Saela. In the town I found that &quot; small-pox had prevailed during the monsoon and was still present, though &quot; only lately reported by the vaccinator. &quot; I next visited the Wadwan district where the vaccinator had been &quot; reported for false entries. I verified the report, and the superintendent &quot; general suggested his discharge ; but as he had hitherto borne a good cha- &quot; racter, he was cautioned and reprimanded. &quot;I next passed through the border of the Limdi district, where I found &quot; the work neglected, but the vaccinator had commenced in that direction. In &quot; the Veramgaon district I found the new work good, but the old very bad, &quot; as reported last year by Dr. Butler; there had been much small-pox which was &quot; not reported, though the vaccinator had been at some of the villages while &quot; it prevailed. B 9934 &quot; At Sanand, I saw the vaccinator Valabrám Dinánáth, and found him &quot; quite competent to carry on the work which had been very much neglected, &quot; and small-pox had been very prevalent, but not reported by him or the &quot;Assistant Superintendent Sardarmia; his recent work however was good. &quot; With the consent of the superintendent general he was re-instated on &quot; the 1st of March, having been suspended for two months. &quot; In the town of Sanand, which is in charge of the hospital assistant at &quot; the dispensary, Balaji Mukund, the vaccination had been much neglected. &quot; This man, who was on leave at the time of my visit, had been repeatedly &quot; supplied with fresh lymph, which generally failed in his hands though re- &quot; ported good by other vaccinators. I introduced good lymph before I left. &quot; At Veramgaon the work of. the municipal vaccinator was good, but &quot; the amount was insufficient. &quot; In Jinjiwada the cicatrices were middling, and there had been much &quot; small-pox which had not been reported especially in the town of Lakhtar. &quot; In Dhrangdra the work was good, but small-pox prevailing to a small &quot; extent. I saw several cases amongst the Dheds at the village of Matak. &quot; I sent for the vaccinator who reported that it did not spread any further &quot; after my visit. &quot; In the Morvi district small-pox was prevailing in an epidemic form ; &quot; it had previously been reported by Assistant Superintendent Ranchoddás, &quot; who, with the assistance of a candidate, was engaged in suppressing it. &quot; I found it in many villages, principally among the Dheds, who were en- &quot; tirely unprotected. &quot; In Dharol, where I was at the end of the year, I found small-pox in &quot; the Amrun and Juria tálukás. It is reported to be raging in the town of &quot; Juria, which I am about to visit. &quot; On the whole, I think vaccination is making satisfactory progress in &quot; the circle. &quot; In Kathewád, the only part of which I have any previous knowledge, &quot; it has certainly made a great advance since 1867, when I acted as super- &quot; intendent; but still small-pox is very prevalent, and nothing but constant &quot; supervision will keep the vaccinators up to working in a way that will &quot; effectually suppress it; they are too apt to be careless about their lymph, &quot; and consequently much of their work is comparatively useless.&quot; Dr. Williams' tour. Dr. Williams' tour in Sindh covered nearly the whole province. In Karáchi zilhá he visited 6 tálukás and 4 dispen- saries. In Haidrabad collectorate he visited 8 tálukás. In Shikarpur zilhá 13 tálukás, and the whole of the tálukás in the Upper Sindh Frontier district and in the Thar and Parkar. He inspected every dispensary on his route. Aid from civil and poli- tical officers. 69. It may be said that the backbone of the department is the aid and support it receives from the revenue and political offi- cers. The officers of the department are the head and arms; but they would fall to pieces in useless efforts without the willing aid of all local authorities. This dependence on such aid is probably more marked here under our voluntary system than it would be among a more highly educated and better off people : but, even
35 where vaccination is compulsory, and the people highly educated and well-off, as in England, Germany and Sweden, the influence of local authorities is a constant moral aid to the compulsion of the law ; and we have seen the disas- trous results of ignoring such aid in the epidemics of small-pox which have in recent years afflicted London as compared with the immunity of Sweden, where the influence of the clergy, all officials and leading men of the country throw the weight of their influence on the side of the law of compulsion. While then heartily acknowledging the moral aid of the revenue and poli- tical officers, I invoke its continuance. The youngest revenue officer can aid the department by merely calling for a village register of vaccination and calculating roughly the rate per mille vaccinated to population in say the preceding two years. We should certainly aim at vaccinating over 30 per mille annually of the population if the births be 40.96 per mille. Deaths from small-pox . 70. In table No. VII. I have shown, in the last column, the number of deaths from small-pox in each registration circle. The total registered for the whole presidency in the calendar year 1874 was 3,903, in 1873 the number was 9,946, and in 1872 it was 26,699. There is not the least doubt about the uncertainty of these figures, and I consider them so unreliable for statis- tical purposes, that I place no exact value on them; but, although they are not of any exact statistical value, they are of this relative value36 &quot; duced from Kamrej pargana of Gaikawadi territory; everywhere the dis- &quot; ease was readily checked. In the whole of Gujarath a very severe epidemic &quot; of measles and chicken-pox prevailed from February up to the close of &quot; the year.&quot; 473 deaths were reported. Small-pox in the West- ern Gujarath circle. 4th.37 &quot; 1 in July) in the Karáchi collectorate*; 1 in Badin in July in the Haidr- &quot; abad collectorate ; one in Ghotki in April in the Shikarpur collectorate ; &quot; 2 in Thul* in May in the Jacobabad district; and 4 in Nagar Parkar (338 year 26 really died of measles. Here is an error to the extent of 35 per cent. The errors so carefully and precisely shown by Dr. Williams exhibit how useless the small-pox deaths' returns really are as far as exact knowledge is concerned. The frequent irruptions of small-pox into Sindh was brought to the notice of Government through the Commissioner in Sindh's Memorandum No. 243, dated 9th March 1875, giving cover to Dr. Williams' letter No. 921, dated 20th idem, and Government in their Resolution No. 849, dated 20th idem, in the General Department, transfer red the subject to the Political Department, and a Resolution was passed, in order to ascertain if a better system of vaccination could be introduced into Kutch and into the Rajputana states, which was communicated to the political officers there. Obstacles to the spread of vaccination. 71. It may be affirmed generally that there is no real opposition to vaccination anywhere now ; but if we come to par- ticulars we note a good deal of apathy and care- lessness on the part of communities that are not only intelligent but are believers in the value of vaccination as a prophylactic. Then again there are limited areas, or rather castes, in which vaccination makes but slow progress; such are the tálukás of Nargund and Ron in Dharwad collectorate, and in a part of Bombay city itself. In the first instance, the caste is the Lingayat Wanis who stop progress ; in Bombay it is the Mahomedans. Dr. Raby has complained of want of assistance, in collect- ing the children for inspections, from village officials in some few instances. But I do not think the officers of the department have much to complain of in this respect. Speaking for myself I can say I do not meet the least diffi- culty, and further I have almost always met with the very best attention from village officers. But even if an officer of the department occasionally do meet with some little want of the usual politeness of village officials, it can- not be very much wondered at, for it is self-evident that our inspections must be a trouble to parents : they cannot bring their children for our inspec- tion without leaving their own work to stand for at least some little time. These inspections are absolutely necessary, because without them Govern- ment could not be certain that the vaccinations are good. Mr. E. P. Robert- son, collector of Dharwad, in his letter No. 3783, dated 10th December 1874, says:39 protect their offspring from the dangers of small-pox. To attempt to drive them would not only defeat our object but would bring odium on Govern- ment. Maps supplied to vacci- nators. 72. During the past year a good many of the vaccinators have received maps of their tálukás, and as soon as Mr. Light can supply the remainder they will be issued to the vaccinators. In the Southern circle Dr. Raby has numbered each village on the maps in a serial order, thus, 1, 2, 3, 4, &c., and his vaccinators are to go over their táluká villages in the serial order. This, I believe, will answer most admirably, and will ensure that all villages are visited. Inspection of dispen- saries. 73. In the revised rules regarding charitable dispensaries (1875) para- graph 23, Government have ordered superintendents of vaccination to inspect the dispensaries in their circles when they are on tour. Dr. Cody, in refer- ence to the orders of Government, has asked for further and more particular orders, and in submitting his letter to Government I suggested that super- intendents of vaccination, after inspecting a dispensary should put on record in a visitor's book in the dispensary their opinions on the following points, viz. :40 of population were successfully vaccinated. The re-vaccinations numbered 1,562. The percentage of success in primary vaccinations was 95.0, or 7.1 higher than in the previous year; in re-vaccinations it was 54.0. Each vacci- nator vaccinated or re-vaccinated 919 persons, or 345 less than in 1873-74 ; this is owing to the number of vaccinators being higher than in the preced- ing year. The average cost of each successful operation was 13 annas and 10 pies, or 3 annas and 5 pies less than in the former report. The progress in this circle is as satisfactory as can be expected. The deaths from small- pox are returned for the official year at 224, and for the calendar year 1874 at 258. The disease is endemic; only 6 deaths occurred in the three months of August, September, and October, and 60 in April. I visited the Byculla Station several times, and saw Mr. Anantá Chandrobá practising both on the human subject and on the calves. I am satisfied that he and his establish- ment are doing all they can, in the city of Bombay, to protect life from small-pox. Progress in the Central circle. 77. The Central circle was about half the year in charge of Dr. Turn- bull ; in the latter half it has been under mine. The population is 4,866,162, and the area 28,282 square miles ; this is exclusive of Poona and Kirkee canton- ments, but inclusive of the native state of Jat. There are 6 assistant super- intendents and 63 vaccinators. Each vaccinator has an average population of 77,240 and an area of 448 square miles. The primary vaccinations numbered 129,405, including vaccinations at 24 dispensaries and 2 jails; and the suc- cessfully vaccinated were 25.5 per mille of population. The percentage of suc- cess on operations was 97.2. Re-vaccinations numbered only 942. The vac- cinations done by each vaccinator averaged 2,001, or 173 above the average for the whole presidency. Each successful vaccination cost 4 annas and 2 pies, or 1 anna 2 pies less than the average. There were 572 deaths from small-pox in the five collectorates of Poona, Sátárá, Sholápur, Ahmadnagar, and Rat- nágiri, but it is not known how many there were in the native states of Bhor, Phaltan, Jat, Atpadi and Akalkot. The progress in this circle is on the whole very satisfactory. I went through all the districts, except one last cold season. Poona collectorate. 78. The Poona collectorate has a population of 878,785, exclusive of Poona and Kirki cantonments, and an area of 5,095 square miles. There are 8 local fund and 3 municipal vaccinators, and returns have been received from 8 dispensaries. For each of the 11 vaccinators there is an average population of 79,889, which is too high, and an average area of 463 square miles; but these averages do not convey a good idea of the actual of each vaccinator's charge: for instance the Haveli táluká vaccinator has a population of 155,082 and an area of 766 square miles. It is impossible for one vaccinator thoroughly to vaccinate this population in such an area; and these remarks also apply to Khed and Bhim- thadi tálukás. Each of these 3 tálukás ought to have two local fund vac- cinators instead of only one. The total number primarily vaccinated, includ- ing the work of the dispensaries, was 19,381, or 2,408 more than in the pre- vious year41 sorry I cannot speak well of the progress; the establishment has worked well, but is too weak. The total deaths from small-pox were 129. I went through this zilhá last November. Ahmadnagar collecto- rate. 79. The population of Ahmadnagar is 773,938, and the area is 6,647. There are 11 local fund vaccinators and one munici- pal vaccinator, The average for each vaccinator is 64,494 population and 554 square miles. The aver- age area is large, but the average population is not. The total number of primary vaccinations is 24,378, including the vaccinations done at the dis- pensaries of Ahmadnagar and Sangamner and in one jail, which only amounted to 172. The successful operations per mille of population were 30.5, which is very satisfactory, as compared with many other zilhás. The success in primary vaccinations was 98.3 per cent., and in re-vaccinations 75.0. There were only 8 re-vaccinations. Each vaccinator's number of operations aver- aged 2,017, which is very high. There were only 22 deaths from small-pox. This is the only zilhá in the Central circle I did not visit on my last tour. Sholápur collectorate. 80. In Sholápur collectorate the population is 662,986, and the area 3,925 square miles. There are 6 local fund and 3 municipal vaccinators, so each has an average of 73,665 population and 436 square miles, neither of which is too great; but the 3 municipal vaccinators have nothing like the average, so several of the táluká vaccinators have too great an area and too high a population42 vaccinations numbered 31,327, or 27.3 successful operations per mille of po- pulation, and the success in primary vaccinations was 98.2 per cent., and in re-vaccinations 77.7. There were only 79 re-vaccinations. Each vaccinator's average number of vaccinations was 2,173. The progress in this zilhá is very satisfactory. There were only 71 deaths from small-pox. I went through this zilhá from east to west in February last. Ratnágiri collectorate. 82. The collectorate of Ratnágiri has a population of 1,019,136, and an area of 3,868 square miles. There are 11 local fund vaccinators, so they have an average of 92,648 of po- pulation, and 351 of square miles each; the former is a very high average, and the latter a very fair one, but the vaccinators in the tálukás of Ratnágiri, Dápuli and Deogad have respectively populations of 119,741, 143,137 and 118,921, all much too large for one man to protect thoroughly. There were 28,343 primary vaccinations, or 27.3 successful operations per mille of popu- lation, and the percentage of success in primary vaccinations was 96.6. The re-vaccinations reached 810, and the percentage of successful in them was 57.8. Each vaccinator averaged 2,550 vaccinations, which is the highest in the circle. Although there is less work in this report than in the preceding year, still the year's outturn must be considered satisfactory, and is probably about as high as can be maintained for a series of years by the present staff of vaccinators. I regret to notice 321 deaths from small-pox during the year, which is more than occurred in the other four zilhás of the Central cir- cle put together. I went through a portion of this zilhá in March. Native states. 83. There are 5 native states in the Central circle, viz. :43 gives promise of bringing his circle to the front before very long. I met Dr. Raby in Kaladgi zilhá in January last. Belgaum zilhá. 85. The population of Belgaum zilhá is 938,750 and the area is 4,592. There are 8 local fund and 2 municipal vaccinators, and returns are received from the dispensary of Athni. Each vaccinator has an area of 459 square miles and a population of 93,87544 for 2 months, so I shall reckon the total at 10. Each vaccinator had an aver- age area of 569 square miles and a population of 81,603 : both averages are too large. There were 18,887 primary vaccinations or an increase of nearly 5,000, but the successfully vaccinated amounted to only 21.5 per mille of population. The percentage of success was 97.6. Re-vaccinations only numbered 199. Each vaccinator on an average vaccinated 1,734 persons. Small-pox killed 286. Like Belgaum and Dharwad there is much room for further extension here, and I am happy to say there is every probability that the increase next year will be even higher than here shown. I went through this zilhá last January, and I feel sure that real progress is being made. Kanada collectorate. 88. This zilhá, has a population of 398,406 and an area of 4,235 square miles. There were 11 local fund vaccinators, and one municipal vaccinator worked in Karwar for 2 months only. Each man has an average of 36,219 population and of 385 square miles 45 fully vaccinated; on the total operations the percentage of success was 94.946 Kolábá collectorate. 96. The population of Kolábá is 350,405, and the area 1,482 square miles. There are 5 vaccinators, so each has averages of 70,081 and 296 population and square miles re- pectively47 &quot; 3. As this reply gave so little encouragement to any proposal for the &quot; maintenance of an establishment, and as I could not well spare a local &quot;fund vaccinator to go into this country to carry on work, I have taken no &quot; further steps in the matter. I shall, however, take the first opportunity of &quot; introducing, at a personal interview with both the collectors of Khandesh &quot; and Nasik, the subject again with a view of ascertaining what likelihood &quot; there may be of the states contributing towards the expense of a vacci- &quot; nator.&quot; Method proposed of in- troducing vaccination into the Dangs. 100. As far as I know these Dangs are the only places where vac- cination is not practised in this presidency. The population is 39,111, and the area 3,840 square miles, so one vaccinator would at least be required. The people are, I believe, very poor; so perhaps Govern- ment might give a grant of Rs. 276 a year for the maintenance of a vaccina- tor, his peon and contingent expenditure. Unless Government do so, I am afraid vaccination can never be introduced into the Dangs. If Government will give the grant, a native of the Dangs could be trained to vaccinate. Jawar. 101. Jawar has a population of 37,406 and an area of 534. It main- tains 1 vaccinator, who operated on 1,903 persons and successfully vaccinated 47.3 per mille of the popula- tion. This is a very high rate, and it must be over the birth-rate consider- ably. There are no small-pox returns. Janjira. 102. For many years the Sultan of Janjira held out against vaccination, but since the appointment of a vaccinator by His Highness in 1871, vaccination has made wonderful progress, which I believe is a good deal due to Mr. Larcom's influence. The area is 151 miles, and the population 71,996. There are two vaccinators now, but one will be sufficient after the whole of the villages have been once gone over. They vaccinated 4,287, and the percentage of success was 93.8. No less than 54.8 per mille of population were successfully vaccinated. This is the highest rate, except one in the whole presidency, and cannot, of course, be maintained for any length of time. There are no small-pox returns. Penth. 103. The Penth state has a population of 47,033 and an area of 960 square miles, so the population is thin. There is 1 vac- cinator who operated successfully on 26.9 per mille of the population. His total primary vaccinations were 1,361, and there were 51 at the dispensary. The success was 98.3 per cent. on operations. There was only one death from small-pox during the year in the whole state. Progress is very satisfactory. Progress in Eastern Gujarath circle. 104. Dr. Cola is the superintendent of the Eastern Gujarath circle. It has an area of only 15,939 square miles, and a population of 3,147,853. There are 4 assistant superintendents and 46 vaccinators; returns were also received from 19 dispensaries and 1 jail. There is an average population of 68,431 for each vaccinator, and an area of 346 square miles. The pri- mary vaccinations reached 88,885, and the percentage of success 97.1. There were 27.2 per mille of population successfully vaccinated. Re-vaccina- tions reached only 1,759. The average number of persons operated on by each vaccinator was 1,872, or 44 above the general average. The cost of each suc- cessful vaccination was 4 annas and 11 pies, or 5 pies below the average of the
48 whole presidency. The deaths from small-pox were 473. Progress is very satisfactory. I only add a few words to say that we must guard against deterioration of the lymph in the rains, and make an example of any vacci- nator who is detected working with lymph of bad quality. Kheda collectorate. 105. The Kheda collectorate has a population of 782,733 in an area of 1,561, so there are 501 persons to the square mile. There are 9 vaccinators49 population. The area is much too large, and the population is a little too high also. The primary vaccinations numbered 9,634 including 221 at the Sadra dispensary. The percentage of success is 97.1, and there were only 20.8 per mille of population protected during the year. Re-vaccinations only numbered 86 ; no returns of small-pox are received. There is room here for a good deal of progress and extension. Rewá Kanthá. 111. Rewá Kánthá with a population of 512,569 and an area of 4,736 maintains 10 vaccinators ; so each has an average of 51,256 of population and 473 of square miles ; returns are received from the dispensary in Baria. The primary vaccinations were 14,067 and the percentage of success 95.8. There were 26.1 per mille of population successfully vaccinated. There were only 97 re-vaccinations. I have no returns of small-pox. The progress here is very good. Cambay. 112. Cambay state with a population of 83,494 and an area of 350 square miles has 1 vaccinator who primarily operated on 2,660 persons with a success of 98.1 per cent. There were 31.4 per mille of population successfully vaccinated. Re-vaccina- tions were only 24. Progress is very satisfactory. Dharmpur. 113. Dharmpur state has a population of 74,592 and an area of 225 square miles. The 1 vaccinator primarily operated on 3,668 persons and obtained 99.2 per cent. of success. There were 48.7 per mille of population successfully vaccinated. This is a very high rate and must decline after vaccination has been prac- tised a few years more and when all the arrears shall have been worked up. Bansda. 114. Bansda has a population of 32,154 and an area of 321 square miles, and 1 vaccinator primarily vaccinated 2,127, of whom 98.1 per cent. were successful. 66.1 per mille of the population were vaccinated successfully. Vaccination has only been practised here since 1871. The operations were in 1870-71 .................. 89 1871-72 .................. 762 1872-73 .................. 1,457 1873-74 .................. 2,860 1874-75 .................. 2,127 7,295 Sachin state. 115. The small state of Sachin has only 16 villages, a population of 17,103, and an area of 65 square miles. The Chorasi táluká local fund vaccinator of Surat zilhá does the vaccinations in these villages. In the year under report there were 546 primary vaccinations and 1 re-vaccination. There were 30 per mille of population protected in the year. 116. Dr. Cola has written an interesting account of the introduction and progress of vaccination in these native states, which I here give in ex- tenso :50 &quot; The credit of the systematic introduction of vaccination into the native &quot; states of Gujarath is due to Dr. Mahaffy, who was for a lengthened period &quot; superintendent of vaccination in the North-Western Division of Gujarath. &quot; In 1848 Dr. Mahaffy, desirous of carrying out the benevolent intention of &quot; Government with respect to vaccination, suggested to Captain Wallace, the &quot; Political Agent in the Mahi Kánthá, ' the great blessing it would be to the &quot; people in that province if the chiefs would consent to support a couple of &quot; vaccinators to be constantly employed in his districts.' This suggestion &quot; was warmly taken up by the Political Agent, who offered to guarantee the &quot; pay of one vaccinator himself. The scheme, having been submitted to the &quot; Medical Board, was placed before Government and circulars were addressed &quot; in March 1849 to several political officers on the desirability of introducing &quot; vaccination into the native states, in response to which the first steps were &quot; taken and vaccination was commenced in several states. As regards Mahi &quot; Kánthá, Rewá Kánthá and Pálanpur, the following information will not be &quot; altogether uninteresting. Mahi Kánthá. &quot; In 1849, on the suggestion of Dr. Mahaffy, the Political Agent succeeded &quot; in inducing the Maharaja of Idar to engage one vac- &quot; cinator for his districts. It was not possible to get &quot; the minor chiefs at once to agree to defray the expenses of another vaccina- &quot; tor, but the Sadra Bazar Fund was at the time rich, and Captain Wallace, &quot; with the sanction of Government, engaged an additional vaccinator who &quot; was paid out of the Bazar Fund for some time till assistance from the minor &quot; chiefs was obtained. The following shows the progress of vaccination for &quot; the few years following the introduction of vaccination :51 &quot; 2. Such were the first steps in the introduction of vaccination in the &quot; three principal native states in the north of Gujarath. The persevering &quot; efforts of the officers of the vaccination department, combined with the &quot; cordial assistance rendered by the political officers, have succeeded in placing &quot; vaccination on a firm and permanent footing everywhere. In Mahi Kánthá, &quot; the Idar Darbar now entertains two vaccinators on liberal allowances, and &quot; the minor chiefs all contribute towards the expenses of three vaccina- &quot; tors ; in all five vaccinators are employed in this district, and the number &quot; is quite sufficient; but owing to physical and territorial difficulties, vaccina- &quot; tion is still somewhat backward in the eastern and northern parts. In &quot; Pálanpur the diwan sahib employs two vaccinators, the nawáb of Rád- &quot; hanpur one, the petty thakurs contribute to the pay of one vaccinator, &quot; and from the fine fund of the superintendency two vaccinators are paid, &quot; in addition to which one man is paid by Government for camp Dísá and its &quot; environs, making in all 7 vaccinators. There is no difficulty of any kind &quot; in this state, and vaccination is carried on everywhere with ease. The &quot; Rewá Kánthá is sufficiently well provided with vaccinators, there being in all ten men, and vaccination is progressing well (marginally noted) in all the states which are under the immediate control of the agency. The Chotá Udaipur and Rájpiplá states are ruled by indepen- dent princes, and vaccination in these states is not so good, nor so extended, owing to the want of cor- diality and support of the darbárs to the vaccina- &quot; tors ; partly also it is owing to the inefficiency of the men employed, but &quot; it is hoped that, with time, these difficulties will be got over. Rájpiplá, 2 vaccinators. Báriá, 2 52 average proportion of 68,770 of population and 570 square miles. The primary vaccinations numbered 113,928, of which 2,937 were returned by 14 dispensaries and 1 jail, and the percentage of success was 95.9. There were 29.0 per mille of population successfully vaccinated. The re-vaccinations were 2,614. Each vaccinator averaged 2,141 persons, or 313 above the general average. The cost of each successful vaccination averaged only 3 annas and 9 pies, or 1 anna 7 pies less than the general average. I have no returns for Kathewád and Pálanpur regarding small-pox, but the deaths in Ahmadábád zilhá were 388, 165 of which were in the Dhanduka táluká alone. As we have now another vaccinator in that very large táluká, I trust the deaths from this disease will not be so many again. The progress in this circle is very satisfactory, but I regret to add that it was tarnished by ten instances of falsification of registers. Ahmadábád collectorate. 118. The population of Ahmadábád collectorate is 829,637, and the area 3,844 square miles. There are 7 local fund vacci- nators and 5 municipal, and returns were received from 6 dispensaries. Each vaccinator has an average population of 69,136, and an area of 320 square miles. The primary vaccinations numbered 22,998, and the percentage of success 95.5. There were 25.7 per mille of population primarily vaccinated successfully. Re-vaccinations were 1,930. I have already said that there were 388 deaths from small-pox. Progress in this zilhá is very satisfactory. Kathewád. 119. The population of Kathewád is 2,312,629, and the area 20,339. There are 33 vaccinators maintained by the chiefs and 1 by Government. The latter is in Rajkot camp. Each vaccinator has an average population of 68,018, and an area of 598 square miles. The average population is moderate, but the area is high. The primary vaccinations numbered 77,311, and the percentage of success was 96.1. There were 31.1 per mille of population successfully vaccinated primarily. Re-vaccinations were 1,222. Each vaccinator on an average operated on 2,253, or 425 above the average for the whole circle ; but I regret to add that ten of the vaccinators were found to have falsified their registers, but in nearly all cases to such a very small extent, that I am compelled to doubt there having been much intentional or criminal falsification. There are 8 dispensaries and 1 jail in Kathewád, from which returns were received. The progress in Kathewád is very good, and I doubt not but Dr. Blomfield will soon suppress all falsifications. Pálanpur states. 120. The area of the states of Pálanpur is 6,041 square miles, and the population 502,586. There are 6 vaccinators main- tained by these states and 1 by Government for the camp of Dísá. Each vaccinator has an average population of 71,798 and 863 square miles; the area is very large, but the population is moderate. The primary vaccinations reached 13,612, and the percentage of success was 96.0. There were 24.8 per mille of population protected in the year. Re- vaccinations only numbered 2. The progress is very good. Progress in Sindh circle. 121. The Sindh circle is under the superintendence of Surgeon Williams. He has 6 assistant superintendents, but only 5 were employed for the greater part of the year. There are 50 vaccinators, of whom 5 are municipal, 2 are paid by native states, and 43 by local funds, and vaccination is carried on at 19 dis- pensaries. The population is 2,322,755, and the area 49,306 square miles, so
53 each vaccinator has an average of 46,455 of population, and 986 of square miles. The average population is small, but the area is very high. The number of primary vaccinations was 94,263, and the percentage of success 98.2, There were 39.1 per mille of population primarily vaccinated successfully. Re-vacci- nations reached 48,504, or more than all the other circles put together. The success in re-vaccinations was 85.9. Each vaccinator, on an average, vaccinat- ed or re-vaccinated 2,790, or 962 above the general average for the whole presidency. The cost of each successful vaccination was 4 annas 2 pies, or 1 anna 2 pies below the average. There were only 31 deaths returned for small-pox, and even of this small number, Dr. Williams thinks, some were not deaths from small-pox at all, but from measles ; but to counter-balance this, he says all the deaths from small-pox have not been registered. I visited this circle in September. Karáchi. 122. The population of Karáchi collectorate is 423,495, and the area is 14,091. The vaccinators numbered 1054 primary vaccinations numbered 10,371, and of these 97.7 per cent, were successful. There were 54.5 per mille of population protected by primary vaccination. Re-vaccinations numbered 9,694 and the percentage of successful in them was 65.2. The average number of persons operated on by each vaccinator was 3,167, or 1,339 above the general average. The deaths from small-pox were only 5. Progress is satisfactory, but I do not think the primary vaccinations can possibly be kept as high as last year for any length of time. Upper Sindh Frontier District. 126. The Frontier district of Upper Sindh has a population of 89,985 and an area of 1,913 square miles. There are 3 local, fund vaccinators, so each has an average of 29,995 of population and 637 square miles; the population is very small but the area is large. The primary vaccinations numbered 3,599 and the percentage of success in them was 99.1. There were 39.7 per mille of population protected. Re-vaccinations numbered 1,322, and the percentage of success was 98.4, or nearly as high as in primary vaccinations. Each vaccinator, on an average, vaccinated 1,640 persons, or 188 less than the general average. 2 deaths only occurred from small-pox. The progress here is satisfactory. Khairpur native state. 127. His Highness Mir Ali Murad's territory has a population of 130,350 souls and an area of 2,708 square miles. His Highness keeps 2 vaccinators. They primarily vacci- nated 9,536 persons and re-vaccinated 163. The percentage of success in the former was 97.5 and 81.8 in the latter. There were 69.1 per mille of popula- tion protected by primary vaccination. This high rate could only be reached by vaccinating many grown up boys and girls, if not actually young adults. It is the highest recorded. Progress in Baroda circle. 128. The Baroda territory extends to about 4,400 square miles and has a population of 2,000,225, so there are about 450 souls to the square mile. H. H. the Gaikawad maintains 1 assistant superintendent and 23 vaccinators, and the whole is administered by the residency surgeon of Baroda. Each vaccinator has an average area of 191 square miles and a population of 86,96655 Progress of vaccination in Kutch. 130. H. H. the Rao's territory extends to 6,500 square miles and has a population of 487,305. There is 1 assistant superin- tendent, and there are 11 vaccinators maintained by H. H. and by the Bhayads. Over the whole, the medical officer of H. H.'s hospital in Bhuj, Mr. Dorábji Hormasji, exer- cises a kind of supervision. Each vaccinator has an average area of 590 square miles and a population of 44,300, but really the vaccinators work in very limited populations and areas, and little or no attempt has ever been made systematically to vaccinate over the whole country. The primary vaccinations numbered only 3,025 and the percentage of successful was 93.9. There were only 5.7 per mille of the population vaccinated successfully in the year 1874-75, whereas there might have been six times as many. Each vac- cinator on an average only operated on 275 persons, while the average for the department as a whole in Bombay Presidency is 1,828. The cost was 14 annas and 8 pies for each successful case, or 9 annas and 4 pies above the general average. Vaccination is very backward in Kutch, and if any real wish exists for the benefits of vaccination, H. H. the Rao's Vaccination establish- ment should be placed under the superintendence of the superintendent of vaccination in Western Gujarath circle. If this were done I would guarantee that the progress of vaccination would soon be as good as in British circles. H. H.'s establishment is too small to require a superintendent all to itself, and the cost of one would run up the cost of vaccination even higher than it is already; but if H. H. will place his establishment under Dr. Blomfield, and give that officer a small allowance for the charge, I have not the least doubt but the greater amount of work would amply repay H. H. and be an immense boon to his subjects. 131. When I returned to India from furlough in 1873 I found on the records of my office Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India's despatch No. 4 (Sanitary) dated India Office, London, 26th March 1872, in which the Army Sanitary Commission recommended that the vaccination department should be utilized in the general sanitation of this presidency, and the Duke of Argyll, in the despatch, said in reference to this, &quot; I commend to the particular &quot; attention of your Excellency in Council the views expressed in the latter &quot; part of the paper received from the Commission.&quot; In my previous report I drew attention to the despatch, and stated my conviction that the vaccination department might aid in the general sanita- tion of the country without injuring the efficiency of the vaccination depart- ment, and since then Government has been pleased to issue the following orders :56 &quot; 3. They will advise generally on local sanitary matters, more especially &quot; with regard to surface conservancy, ordinary surface and subsoil drainage, &quot; and the conservation of tanks, wells and other sources of water supply. &quot; 4. As regards Epidemics, they will advise general precautionary mea- &quot; sures, and try to find out their distinguishing characteristics, their causes &quot; and their course. &quot; 5. In all that relates to their duty as Health Officers they will commu- &quot; nicate direct with the Sanitary Commissioner and with local authorities. &quot; 6. Assistant Superintendents and Vaccinators will also inspect the &quot; registers and report to their Departmental Superiors as to how they are &quot; kept. Assistant Superintendents will advise Patels and others as to ordi- &quot; nary village cleanliness, will look at wells, tanks, &c., and report generally &quot; what attention is paid to simple matters of conservancy. &quot; 7. Neither the Superintendents nor their subordinates are to do &quot; more than advise, and they will confine their advise (the latter especially) &quot; to such simple matters as are within the reach of the people, or which &quot; involves no outlay beyond the means of those advised. &quot; 8. The Birth and Death registers will be kept by the present agency &quot; (Kulkarnis and others), but all entries are to be made in Register Books, &quot; which will be prepared under the orders of Government, and no change is &quot; to be made in them without the sanction of Government. &quot; 9. As suggested by the Surgeon General, the Sanitary Commissioner &quot; should, in conjunction with the Superintendent General of Vaccination, &quot; draw up such general rules or directions relating to the matters above re- &quot; ferred to, as will enable the Superintendents of Vaccination to familiarize &quot; themselves with the kind of work expected of them, and also afford them &quot; the means of instructing their subordinates, the more intelligent of whom &quot; may be expected to become useful assistants in Sanitary work.&quot; I feel certain this step will in a short time obtain for the sanitary de- partment more correct figures regarding life and death ; but until the vital statistics are in the hands of the health officers the progress in respect to correctness will be limited. I have, in a memorandum now before Govern- ment, expressed my views on the whole subject of the union of the sanitary and vaccination departments, but as it is still under consideration I can only just allude to the matter here.

Vaccination. No. 2349. GENERAL DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 6th August 1875. Letter from the Surgeon General, Indian Medical Department, No. 2085, dated 9th July 1875( 2 ) in Cutch and 919 in Bombay to 2,790 in Sind. So that, taking the work- ing days of the year at 300, each Vaccinator in Sind operated on 9 persons daily, while in Bombay the number was only 3, although the population in Sind is widely scattered and that in Bombay is just the reverse. 8. Government concur with the Superintendent General in consider- ing the punishment of fine to a Vaccinator who falsifies his returns as wholly inadequate. Such an offence is invariably to be punished by dismissal. 9. Government are not prepared to pay for a Vaccinator in the Dangs, but it is clearly desirable that the people there should be protected. The question should be referred for the consideration of the Political Agent in Khandesh. 10. The addition of sanitary work to the duties of the Vaccination Department is a measure which will enable that efficient but expensive body to show greater returns of work, and it will, the Government are confident, be attended with excellent results to the country generally. 11. The Government of India have recently drawn attention to the necessity for economy in printing annual reports. Government recognize, in the length of that under review, the careful attention to minute details, which, coupled with the zeal Dr. Pinkerton has infused into his subordinates, has rendered the work of the Department so satisfactory. But they trust that the Superintendent General will be able next year to condense a good deal of his information, especially that towards the conclusion of the report. 12. Copies of the Report and this Resolution should be sent to the Secretary of State as usual. W. G. PEDDER, Acting Secretary to Government.

FROM THE SURGEON-GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, GENERAL DEPARTMENT. Bombay, 4th July 1876. SIR, I have the honour to forward the annual report on vaccination for 1875-76. 2. This report shows that vaccination has been considerably extended at a comparatively less cost than in any one of the pre- ceding 7 years. No changes of any importance have taken place in the system during the year, but that of placing the vaccination of civil populations in cantonments under this department. 3. There were 4 more vaccinators employed during the year. 4. The total number of persons vaccinated and re-vaccinated was 808,353, or 75,729 of an increase over the previous year, of which 18,822 were primary vaccinations and 56,907 re-vaccinations. It is very gratifying to observe that there were 22,573 infantile vaccinations more than in the preceding year : so, the percentage being 46 on the total, 3 higher than in 1874-75. The whole in- crease in primary vaccinations has been among infants, the best possible sign of satisfactory progress that could be offered. The great increase in re-vaccinations is chiefly noticed in Sind and the city of Bombay. In the latter it is wholly due to the recent severe epidemic of small-pox. Considering that in the previous report Dr. Pinkerton estimated that eight-tenths of the available children were primarily vaccinated, it is obvious that future progress must be slow. 5. The disparity between the sexes is again less, but Aden and Bombay city still show a large excess of males. In the for- mer it is satisfactorily accounted for in this report by Dr. Hay, and the same reason may be said to hold good in Bombay, viz., the objection of parents to bring their grown-up girls into public. B 106( 2 ) As regards caste, there is a large increase of Hindus and a decrease of Musalmans, chiefly in Sind, where the subjects for primary vaccination are said to have been fewer. The number of Parsis is fully double that mentioned in the previous report, the result of the epidemic in Bombay. 6. The percentage of success in primary vaccinations was 97, being higher than in the previous year; in re-vaccinations it was 85.2, also higher ; but there is considerable doubt of this latter percentage being correct, owing to the difficulty of determining what is a success. It would, I think, be well were re-vaccinations tabulated under the heading &quot; perfect &quot; and &quot; imperfect success&quot;, instead of &quot;successful&quot; and &quot;unsuccessful&quot;; this, although open to the objection that the vaccinators are not scientifically trained medical officers, yet would, in my opinion, be an improvement, and give more precise information on this point. 7. The work has been carried on in a population of 25,167,234. In British territory 27.1 per mille of population were successfully vaccinated primarily, and in native states 24.4. These figures show an increase, respectively, of 0.2 and 2.1, and, on the whole Presidency, 26.2 of primary successful vaccinations to popula- tion. 8. The lymph, generally, was good, but in 4 circles had to be renewed. The usual annual supply of lymph from England was not received ; and I concur with Dr. Pinkerton that the Secre- tary of State should be asked to send out 2 supplies, of 45 tubes each, in October and November. Cow-lymph has been kept up in Bombay throughout the year, and was found of the utmost value during the epidemic;( 3 ) 395,657 vaccinated persons, which is almost 50 per cent. of the work of the year. I regret to observe that 12 vaccinators were dismissed for falsification( 4 ) will be pleased to notice the efforts of Dr. Dorabji Hormasji, medi- cal officer to H. H. the Rao of Cutch, to improve the state of vacci- nation in his territory. 17. It is gratifying to notice the remark by Dr. Pinkerton in para. 111, that the past year's work is the best he has ever re- corded. The work of vaccination has been so ably superintended by this officer for above 8 years, as evidenced by the yearly pro- gress it has made, that I cannot but regret the possibility of his appointment being abolished; and I feel sure Government will gladly recognize the great value of the services of this officer in this special department of sanitation. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, WM. THOM, F.R.C.S., Surgeon-General.
REPORT ON VACCINATION THROUGHOUT THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY AND SIND FOR THE YEAR 1875-76. Divisions of Report. This is the eighth annual report of the Superintendent Ge- neral of Vaccination. As usual, it will show : 1st, the work of the past year as a whole ; 2nd, the progress vaccination has made in each district; and, 3rd, the tables of figures, in which the number of vaccinations, cost, &c., are given in the forms ordered by the Government of India. No changes in Circles. Contemplated changes in Circles. 2. No change has been made in the circles of vaccination; but a proposal is now before the Government of India which, if ap- proved, will cause the circles to be arranged after the manner of the registration divisions. The circles will then stand thus :2 Compulsory Vaccination Bill in accordance with the suggestions made by the Government of India. The subject is now before Government. Cantonments situated with- in Circles to be under Su- perintendents of Vaccina- tion. 4. This Government in their Resolution No. 3550, dated 26th November last, under instructions from the Government of India, ordered that the vaccination of all cantonments situated within vaccination circles shall be under the circle superintendents of vaccination; and with reference to this, I recently submitted to the Surgeon-General a detail of the changes and arrangements necessary to carry out the orders. The principles laid down by the Govern- ment of India are : 3 Table No. I. Number. Circles. Area in Square Miles. Population. 1875-76. 1874-75. Superintendent General. Superintendents.

4 Increases and Decreases in Establish- ments. 6. All the vaccinators, except the 6 in Government employ- ment, are paid by municipalities, local fund committees, and native states. The municipalities maintained 50, or 1 less than in 1874-75; the local funds 207, or 4 more; the native states 130, or 1 more ; and Government 65 Table No. III. Circles.

There is an increase in all circles except one, but the greatest advance has been made in the Presidency and Southern circles, where there is most room for it ; there are also very good increases in the Central and Sind circles, but in the latter the increase is wholly due to the number of re-vaccinations, as there is an actual decrease in the primary vaccinations.

The total number of persons primarily vaccinated was 690,639, being an increase of 18,822 over the year 1874-75. Table No. V. shows the number by each establishment. It could hardly be expected that the increase in primary vacci- nations would be great, seeing it was estimated in last report that they had amounted to eight-tenths of the available children in the year 1874-75. Future extension must now be very slow and gradual. Excess of operations over the number of persons vac- cinated. 14. There were 4,699 operations more than persons; that is to say, so many secondary operations were performed on persons who had been unsuccessfully vaccinated. I wish more of the 20,351 un- successful cases had been operated on a second time, but I know that many mothers object to a second operation immediately after a failure. Re-vaccina- tions.

The total number of persons re-vaccinated was 117,714, or 56,907 more than in the preceding year. In this table is shown the number in each circle. There is a large increase in the Sind and Presidency circles, and con- siderable progress in the Southern, Central, and Gu- zerat circles. Re-vaccination is making quite as much pro- gress as can be expected. While there is a great increase in Sind in respect to re-vac- cinations, there is a consider- able decrease in primary vaccinations, due, Dr. Williams says, to want of subjects and much attention having been given to re- vaccination. There were 960 operations more than persons ; that is to say, so many persons were operated on more than once. In the two talukas of Badin and Bago Tando, in Hyderabad Zillah, there were 12,001 persons re-vaccinated, or 120 per mille of population. Dr. Williams says :7 3 years previously; but if the vaccine marks be not good, I think a child in the presence of small-pox is all the safer for being re-vaccinated. In Bombay city the desire for re-vaccination dur- ing the epidemic became very great, especially among the Euro- pean and Parsi communities. Mr. Ananta Chandroba says that children were brought to be re-vaccinated who had been vaccinat- ed only 6 months before, and whose good marks plainly showed the protection was complete. The strain on the establishment was very heavy, as may be readily understood when I mention that the crews of 58 ships in harbour, the employés in 27 public offices and work-shops, the residents in 5 hotels, the clerks, peons, and coolies in 32 private offices and banks, and the scholars in 14 schools and colleges were re-vaccinated. If the work had been done at public vaccine stations, it would have given little or no trouble; but it was done at the dockyard, at public and private offices, schools, &c., and caused an immense amount of hard work to the establishment. I think Mr. Ananta Chandroba de- serves the thanks of Government for the excellent manner he has carried on his duties during the epidemic, for the zeal he has dis- played, and for the great labour he has undergone in meeting the demands of an alarmed community. Mr. Ananta Chandroba speaks very highly of the exertions of his Head Vaccinator, Sada- sheo Balshet, and of the rest of his establishment, who did their very utmost from early morning till evening every day8 is some objection to vaccinate grown-up girls, while there is none for boys. The disparity in the Western Circle is very small, and Dr. Cody says in some talukas the females exceed the males in his returns. The disparity in the Presidency Circle is due to the epidemic causing many more adult males to seek vaccination than grown-up girls, who cannot go out in public so easily as their brothers. Caste. 18. There were primarily vaccinated 4,094 Christians, 535,230 Hindus, 100,110 Musalmans, 2,848 Parsis, and 47,532 of other castes. The percentages on the total are :9 Table No. IX.

I am afraid the per- centage in re-vaccinations cannot be considered of much value, as it is difficult often to say whether the result in a re-vaccination should be considered successful or not. Very few of the re-vac- cinations which I have seen, have been successful in the sense of having well-shaped vesicles, and running the course a primary vaccination does ; but in most cases which are reckoned success- ful a kind of vesicle was formed, and the course of it was irregu- lar, generally maturing much quicker than in primary vaccination. 22. I here show the result by establishments :10 Table No. XI. Circles. Total number of persons primarily vaccinated successfully. Populations.

These figures show an increase of 0.2 and 2.1 respectively as com- pared with those of 1874-75. Lymph. 24. No lymph was received from England during the past year. That in use has been generally reported as good and efficient. In the Presidency circle animal lymph was chiefly used, and it was of good quality; but at the beginning of the epidemic of small-pox it was difficult to get enough of calves to supply sufficient lymph to vaccinate the crowds of people who flocked to the vaccine stations. Mr. Pedder and Dr. Weir promptly stepped in with their aid, and supplied as many calves as were necessary by purchasing them at the slaughter-house. I trust Government will be pleased to acknowledge this aid. In the Central and Western circles the lymph was everywhere good throughout the year. In the Southern, Eastern Guzerat, and Western Guzerat circles it was generally good, but in some instances it had to be renewed. In Sind circle it was better than usual. In Cutch it was generally good, but was renewed in October by lymph sent from Kattywar by Dr. Blomfield. I need only add that, whenever the lymph of a vaccinator is in an unsatisfactory state, it is immediately replaced by virus of unquestionable quality. English lymph ; an- nual supply desirable. 25. I regret that the annual two supplies of English lymph were not received, because it is a good thing to have new lymph at the beginning of the cold season to replace any which may have deteriorated. I would beg to suggest that Government call the attention of Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India to the omission of the annual supplies last November and January, and
11 that a request be made to continue them ; and, if possible, each of the two supplies should contain 45 tubes, which would enable me to distribute 5 to each superintendent. They should be despatch- ed from England in October and November. Animal vac- cination. 26. Animal vaccination was practised throughout the year in the city of Bombay, and the lymph taken from the calves pro- duced excellent vesicles in children ; but I regret to observe the resulting percentage of success is 2.1 lower than in the preceding year, which is accounted for by the percentage of success falling to 88.93 in February, when the epidemic of small-pox was causing people to crowd to the vaccine stations, and the supply of calves was then insufficient. I drew the superintendent's attention to the probability of the vaccinators being induced, by entreating crowds of people, to vaccinate too many persons from one vesicle, and told him to guard carefully against this ; but the figures show that the pressure caused, to some extent, what I feared. In March the percentage rose to 91.06, when the calves were sufficient in num- ber to supply any amount of demands for vaccination. Mr. Ananta Chandroba says in his report:12 Expenditure. 28. The total expenditure was Rs. 2,22,802, or an increase of Rs. 2,138 over the preceding year. The following table shows the sums expended by each establishment:13 Table No. XIV.

In the Presidency and Cutch circles the reduction is most marked, being from annas 8-9 to 4-4 in the former and from 14-8 to 10-11 in the latter. In the Central circle there is a decrease of 4 pies, in the Southern 3 pies, in Sind 5 pies, in Baroda 10 pies, and in Aden annas 2-3. The Western and Western Guzerat circles remain the same as in 1874-75, and there is an increase in Eastern Guzerat circle of 2 pies. The great decrease in the cost of each successful case in the Presidency circle is owing to the increase in the number of persons vaccinated during the epidemic, and in Cutch it appears to be due to better arrangements and extension of vaccination in that province. Average cost of each suc- cessful vac- cination. 33. The average cost of each successful vaccination, includ- ing all charges, was annas 4-11, or 5 pies less than in the preced- ing year, which is entirely owing to the extension of vaccination. Seven pence farthing is a very moderate cost for each successful vaccination. Table No. XV. 1875-76. 1874-75. Rs. a. p. Rs. a. p. Government 0 1 9 ......

I think each superintendent has seen suffi- cient children to test thoroughly the work of his vaccinators. Dr. Williams in Sind has again the greatest number of encamp- ments ; Dr. Cody stands next. Dr. Colah has again the greatest number of travelling days. Drs. Williams and Cody have the highest mileage. Dr. Colah inspected the greatest number of vil- lages, and Dr. Blomfield the greatest number of children, but Dr. Colah stands very close to him. Names tested in registers. 36. The following table shows the number of children in- spected by calling the names from the vaccinators' registers :15 Dr. Colah again stands first, but Dr. Cody also stands high, and the lowest figure is 5,68916 of the year, excluding the army vaccinations, which are performed under the supervision of the regimental medical officers. 12 Vaccina- tors dismissed for falsifying registers. 40. The inspections show that the vaccinators' registers are, on the whole, very satisfactorily kept. But I regret to notice there were 2 vaccinators in British territory dismissed for falsi- fication, one in Sind and one in the Southern circle. In Native states 8 were dismissed in Kattywar for this crime, 1 in Cutch, and a third in Kolhápur. So 12 vaccinators were dismissed for falsification. Conduct of vaccinators. 41. Speaking generally the conduct of the vaccinators has been satisfactory. In the Central circle the conduct of the vac- cinators was very good'; Drs. Cody and Colah say the same of those in their circles. Dr. Blomfield dismissed altogether 11 vaccinators, and fined 22 for various faults. The fines ranged from Re. 1 to Rs. 30; several were fined as much as Rs. 15. Considering the pay of a vaccinator is small, it seems to me these fines are excessive in amount. However, I hope the conduct of the vaccinators in Dr. Blomfield's circle will now be improved. In Kattywar harsh measures were necessary to put down falsification, and the dismissals had my hearty approval; but I am doubtful about the good effect of inflicting very heavy fines on men drawing such small pay as vaccinators. Inoculation. 42. Inoculation is said to be practised in Cutch by 2 men when small-pox prevails, and I regret to say I have had informa- tion of it being also carried on by 2 inoculators in Ratnágiri Zillah. I at once communicated with the Collector, but have not since heard from him. The vaccinator of Dápuli taluka re- ported that the police patel of the village of Wágra had 4 of his own children inoculated with small-pox virus, and that 57 other children of the village were also inoculated. I think Government should make an example of this patel, if the Collector have not already done so. I have not heard of this baneful practice being pursued in any of the other circles. Mr. Larcom, the Political Agent at Janjira, informs me that H. H. the Nawab has forbid- den the practice of inoculation since the introduction of vaccina- tion. I think the time has now arrived when Government might forbid its practice in British territory, as there is now means every- where for people to be vaccinated. A proclamation would be sufficient. Vaccino-sy- philis. 43. In no instance has syphilis been known to be com- municated by vaccination, nor has any other ill-effect been ob- served. Small-pox. 44. The returns of small-pox which I receive from the Sani- tary Commissioner are for the calendar year. The total number registered, is 3,545, but in addition to these there were 54 deaths in Aden, 1 in the British army, and 9 in the Native army: total 3,609. This is 298 fewer deaths than in preceding year. I again state my opinion that the returns of deaths from small-pox are not of any exact value, because in Western India deaths from measles are often recorded as from small-pox. The calendar year 1875 was, as regards small-pox, a non-epidemic one, but towards
17 the end of that year small-pox began to assume greater activity, and in January it burst out into an epidemic of unprecedented virulence in the city of Bombay, whence it has spread to the Konkan and Deccan districts. Small-pox in Central circle. 45. In the Central circle the deaths from small-pox were 368, or 204 less than in 1874-75. Small-pox in Southern cir- cle. 46. In the Southern circle 1,406 deaths are recorded, or 186 less than in the preceding year. Small-pox in Western cir- cle. 47. In the Western circle the deaths were 420, or 169 of a decrease as compared with the preceding year. Dr. Cody says :18 Table No. XVIII.19 cases of small-pox ; this is 46.2 per cent. of deaths to attacks. Mr. Ananta Chandroba in his report says:20 how far vaccination and re-vaccination have afforded protection from death by small-pox in the present epidemic in the city of Bombay. I, therefore, take the liberty of asking you, for the pub- lic good and in the interest of science, to kindly fill up, in the form on the back of this letter, the particulars of cases of small-pox which have come under your cognizance as far as you can, and return the form to me after the 1st July next, by which time I hope the epidemic will have completely ceased.21 &quot; fatal. There are also many cases of small-pox after vaccination, &quot; but, as a rule, of a very mild type.&quot; Dr. Dorabji Hormasji reports :22 &quot; cinations are sufficiently prophylactic, there cannot be the shadow &quot; of a doubt; and eventhe death reports of the registration depart- &quot; ment, imperfect as they are proved to be, give ample corrobor- &quot; ation of the fact. Out of 2,272 deaths from small-pox, informa- &quot; tion regarding previous vaccination is recorded in 1,998 cases ; &quot; and of these in only 149 instances is vaccination reported to have &quot; been performed. The rest were not vaccinated at all. That 149 &quot; even is not the correct figure, will be seen when it is known that &quot; in two of these instances the children were barely 2 months &quot; old when they were attacked with small-pox. That these were &quot; previously vaccinated, and that too successfully, is not at all likely. &quot; One of these 149 previously vaccinated, is reported to have died &quot; from small-pox, the disease being only of 8 hours' duration ! &quot; How this was found out, is to me a mystery, seeing that the pre- &quot; liminary fever itself is of 3 days' duration; and, unless the &quot; eruption makes its appearance, nothing can be positively affirmed.&quot; 56. I will now review the work of the different establish- ments23 tion was annas 3-7, or 1-0 less than in the preceding year. On the whole the work of these vaccinators has been satisfactory.

There were 207 local fund vaccinators, or 4 more than in the preceding year24 in primary vaccinations, and is spread more or less over several of the native states of this circle. Each vaccinator operated on 1,749 persons on an average, or 109 more than in 1874-75 ; but this average is 246 below the general average. The percentage of success in primary vaccinations is 96.3, or 0.4 higher than in last report, and each successful case cost annas 3, or 1 pie less than in the preceding year.

Vaccination was carried on at 110 dispensaries by the medical subordinates in charge of them, and returns have been received from 2 jails. At these places 23,744 persons were operated on, or an increase of 2,552, and the success in primary vaccinations is 93.3 to 92.5 as compared with the preceding year. These operations cost the de- partment nothing except lan- cets, forms, and postage. The percentage of success is consi- derably below that obtained by the itinerant vaccinators, but when the number of vaccina- tions is small the success must be comparatively low. The de- crease in the Central circle is owing to work at the dispen- saries of Ahmednagar, Khed, Bársi, Sholápur, Pandharpur, and Talegaon having been placed in the hands of the municipal vaccinators of these towns. Army vacci- nations. 62. Army vaccination shows an increase of 1,027, but in the previous year there was a decrease of 2,074. The total num- ber of persons operated on was 8,307. Average number of persons vac- cinated by each vacci- nator.

The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator for the whole Presidency is 1,995, or an increase of 167 over the preceding year. The average for the 4 army vaccinators cannot be given, as their work is returned in the monthly returns of regi- ments as well as in their own returns, but for other establishments the aver- ages are here given. They each show an increase, except in the case of the 2 Govern- ment vaccinators. Average number of vaccinations per vaccina- tor in each circle, 64.

The Sind circle again stands first as compared with the preced- ing year ; the Presidency circle has jumped from the 9th to the 2nd place; the Central circle again holds the 3rd place ; Western Guzerat has fallen from the 2nd to the 4th place; Aden has risen from the 8th to the 5th place; the Western circle has fallen from the 5th to the 9th place ; and Cutch is again last. The average has risen in all circles except two, viz., Eastern Guzerat and Western circles ; in both the decrease is small. The very high average in Sind is due entirely to the great number of re-vaccinations. Tours of su- perintendents 65. In the Central circle I went through the zillahs of' Poona, Ahmednagar, and Sholápur. I intended to visit Ratnágiri and Satara, but was called into Bombay on account of the severe epidemic of small-pox. I inspected the work of all the vaccina- tors in the Ahmednagar zillah very carefully, and was well pleased with their work in nearly every instance. In the 3 talukas of Poona which I visited the work was also very good, and in Karmála taluka of Sholápur zillah it was fair. Dr. Raby's tour extended through Dharwar and Belgaum zillahs, in which he examined most of the vaccinators' work, and in Kanara he saw the work of 5 men. Dr. Cody visited all the zillahs in his circle, and saw work in 27 talukas. Dr. Colah went through the whole of his districts except Máhi Kánta, and saw work in nearly all talukas. Dr. Blomfield visited the 4 divisions of Kat- tywar, and two talukas of Ahmedabad zillah, but Pálanpur has not been visited for the last three years. Dr. Blomfield was in expectation of being relieved of his vaccination duties; had he thought it likely he should be still in charge of the West- ern Guzerat circle he would have made a point of visiting the Pálanpur territory last cold season. Dr. Williams went through all his districts. He says :26 &quot; Jerruck divisions of the Kurrachee collectorate. On my way I &quot; inspected the work in nearly all the talukas. I did not go to the &quot; talukas of Jacobabad and Kashmor, as there was no work going: &quot; on in them at the time. I omitted inspecting any portion &quot; of the work in H. H. Mir Ali Murad's territory.&quot; Aid of civil and. political officers. 66. All the superintendents, except one, acknowledge the aid they have received from the civil and political officers. With- out their aid and countenance vaccination never could have made the progress it has done. 67. I will now show the progress in each district, and be as brief as possible27 Ahmedna- gar collector- ate. 71. Ahmednagar collectorate is well provided with vaccina- tors, and for the last few years has consequently been making more progress than the other districts of the Central circle. There were 34.3 per mille of population vaccinated. The small- pox deaths were 40, or 18 more than in the preceding year. Sholápur col- lectorate. 72. Sholápur collectorate had too few vaccinators, but one was added during the year, and another has been sanctioned, and will be appointed on 1st March next. The successful vaccinations have risen from 25.5 per mille in 1874-75 to 28.9. The deaths from small-pox were 19, or 10 fewer than in 1874. Satara collec- torate. 73. The Satara collectorate had 12 vaccinators, but 2 more were appointed at the beginning of the year 1876-77. 27.6 per mille of population were successfully vaccinated, or 0.3 more than in 1874-75. The deaths from small-pox were 20, or 51 less than in 1874. Ratnágiri collectorate. 74. Ratnágiri collectorate has too few vaccinators for the population, and at least 3 more are required. There were 26.6 per mille of population successfully vaccinated, or 0.7 fewer than in 1874-75. Each vaccinator vaccinated on an average 2,675, which is the highest average of the circle. The talukas of Ratnágiri, Deogad, and Dápoli each require a second vaccinator, which has been represented to the president of the local fund committee. The deaths from small-pox were 103, or 218 less than in 1874. Native States in Central circle. 75. The native states in the Central circle are making progress : there were 28.3 successful primary vaccinations per mille as compared with 19.1 in the preceding year. Progress in the Southern circle. 76. The Southern circle is in charge of Surgeon Raby. He has 5 assistant superintendents and 74 vaccinators, or 2 more than shown in last report. The population in charge of these vaccinators is 4,601,407: so each has, on an average, 62,181. The primary successful vaccinations were 116,985, or 24.6 per mille of population, which is 2.9 more than in 1874-75. The re-vaccinations numbered 3,425, or an increase of 615 as compared with the pre- ceding year. The cost of each successful case was 5 annas, or less by 4 pies than in the previous year. Each vaccinator on an average operated on 1,658, or 138 more than in 1874-75, but still 337 below the general average. This circle is making progress. The deaths from small-pox were 1,406, or 186 less than in 1874. Belgaum col- lectorate. 77. Belgaum collectorate had 2 more vaccinators than in 1874-75. There are 12 vaccinators altogether, and each has an average population of 76,212. The municipal vaccinator of Gokák was abolished in May 1875 for want of funds, and the dispensary officer has now charge of the town. The successful primary vaccinations were 22,464, or 23.9 per mille of population, or an increase of 7.5. This is very satisfactory, and a further increase may be expected. The deaths from small-pox were 693 to 537 in the previous year.
28 Dharwar col- lectorate. 78. Dharwar collectorate.29 so there are now 12 vaccinators in this zillah ; each has an average area of 598 square miles and 53,919 of population. The primary successful vaccinations were 17,899, or 26 per mille of population, being an increase of 3 as compared with the preceding year. Each vaccinator's average was 1,547, or 38 below the preceding year. The deaths from small-pox were 39, or 8 less than in 1874. Khandesh collectorate. 86. In Khandesh collectorate the number of vaccinators re- main as in 1874-75. The vaccinations numbered 27,906 success- ful, or 27.1 per mille of population, which is exactly the same number as in the preceding year. Only 22 persons are returned as died of small-pox, or 111 fewer than in 1874. Native States in the West- ern circle. 87. The native states in this circle are Jawhár, Janjira, and Peint. The number of vaccinators was reduced by 1 in Janjira. There were 25.8 per mille successfully vaccinated. Progress is satisfactory. Progress in the Eastern Guzerat cir- cle. 88. Dr. Colah is superintendent of Eastern Guzerat circle. There has been no change in the number of vaccinators. The pri- mary successful vaccinations were 83,906, or 26.6 per mille of popu- lation. Re-vaccinations numbered 2,191, or a slight increase over the preceding year. Each vaccinator averaged 1,814, or 58 fewer than last year. The percentage of success in primary vaccina- tions was 97.830 Progress in Western Gu- zerat circle. 94. The Western Guzerat circle is superintended by Dr. Blom- field. There was 1 more vaccinator than in the previous year. Each has now an average population of 65,010. The primary successful vaccinations numbered 112,241, giving 30.7 per mille of population, or 17 more than in the preceding year. The re- vaccinations have slightly decreased. On an average each vac- cinator operated on 2,188, or 47 more than in 1874-75 and 193 above the general average. The cost of each successful case was annas 3-9, or exactly the same as in 1874-75 : this is anna 1-2 below the general average. Ahmedabad collectorate. 95. In Ahmedabad zillah there was 1 more vaccinator enter- tained for the Ranpur petha of Dhanduka taluka; each vaccinator has now an average of 57,808 of a population. There were 27.4 per mille successfully vaccinated to 25.7 of the previous year. Small-pox carried off 177, or 211 fewer than in 1874. Province of Kattywar. 96. In Kattywar the staff remained unchanged. There were 32.9 per mille of population successfully vaccinated, or an increase of 1.8 over the preceding year. Each vaccinator operated on 2,355 persons on an average, or 360 above the general average; but 8 vaccinators were dismissed for falsifying their registers. Pálanpur States. 97. In Pálanpur States there was no change. The number of successful primary vaccinations per mille of population was 26.6, or 1.8 above the preceding year. Progress in Sind circle. 98. The Sind circle is in charge of Dr. Williams. During the year there was 1 vaccinator less employed than the sanctioned strength, and also 1 assistant superintendent less. The number of primary successful vaccinations were 65,954, or 28.3 per mille of population31 Thar and Párkar. 102. Thar and Párkar staff was unchanged. 39.4 per mille of population were successfully vaccinated, or 15.1 below the preced- ing year ; but this is still very high. The deaths from small-pox were 35 to 5 in 1874. Frontier Dis- trict. 103. In the Upper Sind Frontier district only 2 of the 3 vaccinators were employed during the year. The number of primary successful vaccinations equal 19.5 per mille of population, or 20.2 of a fall as compared with the preceding year. No deaths from small-pox. Khairpur State. 104. Khairpur is the only native state in the Sind circle ; in it there are 2 vaccinators employed who successfully vaccinated 39.2 per mille of the population, or 29.9 below the previous year, but still very high. Now that the work here has been so well carried out for the last two years we must expect the numbers to decrease. Progress in Baroda circle. 105. There has been no change in the staff in Baroda circle, but 2 extra vaccinators were temporarily employed for a short time. The successful primary vaccinations were 17.3 per mille of population, or an increase of 4.1 as compared with the preced- ing year, and the percentage of success was 0.3 higher. Each vaccinator on an average operated on 1,679, or 384 more than in 1874-75, but 316 below the general average. The cost was only annas 3-4 per each successful case, or 10 pies below the former year. Progress in Cutch circle. 106. The progress in Cutch is considerable, and gives promise of a still further extension of vaccination in H. H. the Rao's territory. The number of vaccinators was increased from 11 to 12, and the number successfully vaccinated was equal to 9.6 per mille of population, or 3.9 higher than in 1874-75. Each vaccina- tor averaged 436 operations, or 161 more than in the preceding year, but 1,559 below the general average. The cost of each successful case was reduced from annas 14-8 in 1874-75 to annas 10-11 in the year under report. There is still much room for progress in all respects here. Epidemics : Cholera. 107. Epidemic cholera occurred in many zillahs of this presi- dency, and to some extent interfered with the vaccinators carrying on their work. It was considered injudicious to carry vaccinifers from one village to another during the prevalence of cholera, and so there was a diminution in the numbers vaccinated during the prevalence of cholera in a district. Measles. 108. Measles was also epidemic, and there is not the least doubt but many deaths from that disease have been returned as having occurred from small-pox. Inspection of dispensa- ries. 109. Inspection of dispensaries is now one of the duties of superintendents32 2nd.33 Dr. Raby reports :TABLES OF VACCINATION RETURNS, &c., FOR 1875-76.

Letter from the Surgeon-General, Indian Medical Department, No. 2631, dated 4th July 1876( 2 ) dency, from 8 annas 9 pies to 4 annas 4 pies, and Cutch from 14 annas 8 pies to 10 annas 11 pies. In the last-named there is still much room for improvement. The average number of persons vaccinated by each operator varies from 436 in Cutch to 3,060 in Sind. These show a large increase on the previous year, while the Presidency Circle rises to 2,228 from 1,176. 6. The work done by the various Superintendents seems to have been thoroughly satisfactory, Drs. Williams, Cody, Raby, and Blomfield, and Mr. Ananta Chandroba, being specially brought to the notice of Government. Dr. Pinkerton's opinion that personal examination of some 3,000 children by each Superintendent in his own division as to the success of the operations is a sufficient test of the work done, is concurred in. 7. It is much to be regretted that no less than 12 vaccinators had to be dismissed; and, judging from the heavy fines inflicted by Dr. Blomfield on others, more ought to have shared this fate. The expediency of fining repeatedly or heavily such men as vaccinators is open to question. 8. The report of the Collector of Ratnágiri on the subject of inocula- tion in that district, as pointed out in paragraph 42, may be awaited, and the attention of the Collectors of Surat and Kaira called to Dr. Pinkerton's remarks in his 48th paragraph on the extreme inaccuracy of the death re- gisters in their respective districts. Such cases as these show the advantage of utilising the services of the officers of the Vaccination Department in sanitary inspections. 9. In addition to their proper duties as Superintendents of Vaccination the officers of the department have inspected dispensaries, examined birth and death registers, and advised on the removal or abatement of nuisances. 10. In conclusion, Government fully recognise the excellent services of Dr. Pinkerton as head of the department over which he has so long and successfully presided. 11. The usual copies of this report and Government Resolution should be sent to the Secretary of State. E. W. RAVENSCROFT, Acting Chief Secretary to Government.
