No. R1-1REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, ASSAM, FOR THE YEAR 1927-28. PREFACE.2 5. In the Laboratory at Gauhati 443 specimens of various kinds were examined microscopically of which 36 were diagnosed as Anthrax, three as Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and 21 as Surra. The remainder were examined for other blood, skin and intestinal parasites, etc. In the previous year 607 specimens were examin- ed of which 25 proved Anthrax, 18 Hæmorrhagic Septicaemia and 70 Surra. PART I.3 11. The total mortality reported from contagious diseases during the year as compared with the previous two years is as follows : 4 19. Foot-and-mouth disease,28. Anthrax.6 for contagious diseases and 53,297 cases for non-contagious diseases. In the previous year 9,783 villages were visited, 1,591 animals castrated, 28,173 cases treated for contagious diseases and 4.9,263 cases for non-contagious diseases. There was thus an in- crease of 179 villages visited, 72 animals castrated and 4,032 cases treated for non-contagious diseases. There was a decrease of 7,996 cases treated for contagious diseases which was due to less prevalence of contagious diseases during the year. Eight dispen- saries remained temporarily closed for short periods as Reserve Assistants were not available to fill the vacancies. 34. The Veterinary Assistant employed by the Local Board, Dhubri, resigned during the year and the post remained vacant up to the end of the year. As no Veterinary Assistant was found willing to accept the post the Board applied for a Government Veterinary Assistant. The Government was moved accordingly and the post of a 3rd Veterinary Assistant under the Dhubri Local Board was sanctioned at the close of the year. A Veteri- nary Assistant has accordingly been sent there at the beginning of this year. 35. The Reserve and Staff Veterinary Assistants on their tours visited 369 villages, castrated 14 animals, treated 1,574 cases for contagious diseases and 496 cases for non-contagious diseases. In the previous year they visited 917 villages, castrated 34 animals, treated 2,723 cases for contagious diseases and 3,121 cases for non-contagious diseases. VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. 36. Table V shows the work of the three Government Veterinary hospitals at Gauhati, Silchar and Shillong. The total number of animals treated in the hospitals during the year under report including both in and out-patients was 4,221 against 4,275 in the previous year. The total number of cases supplied with medicines for the treatment of animals not brought to the hos- pitals was 54 against 421 last year. The distribution of medicines without the cases being seen is discouraged. Owners are encouraged to bring their animals to the hospitals for examination and treatment. 37. Gauhati Veterinary Hospital.7 16 cruelty cases and no maiming cases last year. Medicines were supplied in 20 cases for treatment of animals not brought to the hospital against none in the previous year. 33. Silchar Veterinary Hospital.8 divided into two, viz., Gauhati Circle No. I and Gauhati Circle No. II with effect from the 27th May 1927, and consequently the Assam Valley Circles were readjusted as follows :9 Nazira Pinjrapoles and Dibrugarh Gowshalla once. He attended the Veterinary Gamp Hospital at Dibrugarh during the Camp of Exercise of the Assam Valley Light Horse. Thirty-five speci- mens were examined by him microscopically during the year. (3) Babu Srish Chandra Ghose, Veterinary Inspector, Silchar, held charge of the Silchar Circle throughout the year except for the periods from the 19th May to the 15th June 1927 and from the 18th July to the 5th August 1927 during which he was on leave. He was on tour for 120 days and travelled 2,684 miles by rail, 250 miles by steamer and 1,278 miles by road and country boat. He visited and re-visited 42 villages and tea estates in connection with the inspection of Veterinary Assistants' work, investigation of diseases and enquiry into the result of inocula- tions. The following hoipitals and dispensaries were inspected by him :10 days and travelled 1,205 miles by rail, 807 miles by steamer and 1,409 miles by road and boat. The following dispensaries were inspected by him :CORRECTION SLIP TO THE REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, ASSAM, FOR THE YEAR 1927-28. In paragraph 50 of the report for the figure " 19 " in column 2 against " Number of cruelty cases examined " substi- tute " 219 " and for the word " maining " in the next item substitute the word " maiming". A. S. P. O (Edn.) No. 41-62511 PART V.12 As I mentioned in my previous reports these figures bear no relation to the great, amount of cruelty which is inflicted on animals in this province. Carelessness, ignorance and lack of sympathy amongst the general population is responsible for this most unsatisfactory state of affairs. I hope further efforts will be made to punish the worst offenders. 51. During the year under report the Veterinary Assistants observed 462 cases of suspected poisoning amongst cattle ; of these 393 were reported to have died. In four cases material sent to the Chemical Examiner showed poisoning by Arsenic. In the previous year 54 cases were suspected to be of poisoning of which 46 cattle died. Sunamganj Circle is responsible for the increase in the number of poisoning cases during the year under report and contributes 367 cases of suspected poisoning and 342 deaths. These cases were reported to the local authority by the Veterinary Assistants. 52. During the year one horse, one elephant and 11 dogs were injected with anti rabic vaccine supplied from the Pasteur Institute, Shillong. In the previous year, one horse, one calf and 22 dogs were injected. 53. One Veterinary Assistant had to undergo anti rabic treatment at the Pasteur Institute, Shillong, during the year as he was exposed to infection during the course of his duties. In the previous year the Superintendent and two Assistants underwent the treatment. 54. The question of grazing grounds and their further extension is so often under discussion that a few remarks from the Veterinary aspect may not be out of place. Public grazing grounds are a great danger to the cattle population because it is there that contagious and parasitic diseases get their best chance of spreading. Contagious diseases acquired in the common grazing grounds are responsible for a great part of the high death-rate. These diseases are rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease, anthrax, etc. No less fatal, but acting more slowly and insidiously are the parasitic diseases which makes animals useless for work or for milk. These infected animals die slowly and all the time they are infecting the pastures so that the healthy become infected and they in their time slowly go the same way. Every grazing ground is well stocked with these useless emaciated, dying animals. They are a danger and should not be allowed on public grazing grounds. Cattle owners who wish to keep their stock fit and healthy must avoid grazing on these common grounds. The alternative is to have a private grazing ground,
13 grow fodder crops and keep only a limited number of healthy animals. Again at certain times of the year the grazing ground is a misnomer, it would be more correct to call it a starving ground. 55. His Excellency the Governor of Assam visited the Veterinary hospitals at Silchar and Gauhati. 56. The Hon'ble Minister of Education, Sir Saiyid Muhammad Saadulla, visited the Veterinary hospital at Silchar and dispensaries at Hailakandi, Sylhet, Karimganj, Maulvibazar, Kulaura, Sibsagar and Jorhat. 57. All the Inspectors carried out their duties in a very satisfactory manner and the Department owes much of its success to their keenness and ability. 58. Office Staff.TABLE II.

REPORT ON THE VETERINARY ADMINISTRATION OF THE MANIPUR STATE FOR THE YEAR 1927-1928. 1. Personnel.31 5. In-patients.GOVERNMENT OF ASSAM. The Governor and the Minister of Educa- tion. Resolution on the Veterinary Report for the year 1927-28. Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Assam in the Education Department, No. 2624E., dated the 18th September1928. READ2 anthrax and ' other contagious diseases.' The use of preventive inoculation on a large scale was continued throughout the year with excellent results. The total number of outbreaks in which inoculations were undertaken during the year was 284 in which four equines, and 5,354 bovines died before inoculation. The total number of animals inoculated was 224 equines, 16,669 bovines and 194 ' others ' of which only 163 bovines died after inoculation. In the preceding year inoculations were under- taken in 565 outbreaks and the number of animals inoculated was 213 equities and 42,200 bovines, of which 752 bovines died after inoculation, the mortality previous to the inoculation being 6 equines and 14,772 bovines. 3. The staff consisted of four veterinary inspectors and 55 veterinary assistants (including one on deputation to Iraq) in addition to three new veterinary assistants who joined during the year. The number of veterinary assistants at the close of the year was 59 against 57 in the preceding year. A post of a third veterinary assistant under the Dhubri Local Board was sanctioned at the close of the year. The redistribution of the inspectors' circles consequent on the appointment of the fourth veterinary inspector has resulted in greater efficiency. His Excellency and his Minister have read with satisfaction the account of the activities of the staff of itinerating and reserve veterinary assistants. During the year these assistants visited 9,967 villages, performed 1,663 castrations and treated 20,177 cases for contagious diseases and 53,297 cases for non-contagious diseases, showing an increase of 179 villages visited, 72 animals castrated and 4,032 cases treated for non-contagious diseases. Due to the decreased prevalence of epidemics there was a decrease of over 8,000 cases treated for contagious diseases. 4. The Superintendent has drawn attention to a remarkable increase in the number of suspected poisoning cases amongst cattle reported by veterinary assistants. The total number was 462 against 54 in the previous year, the increase being almost entirely in the Sunamganj circle. The matter seems to merit further enquiry or explanation. 5. The Governor and his Minister endorse the Superintend- ent's remarks on the dangers attaching to the unrestricted use of public grazing grounds. Not only are these grounds the most common source of infection from such dangerous diseases as rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease and anthrax, but they help to spread those more slowly fatal parasitic diseases which make animals useless for work or for milk.
3 6. The expenditure of the department during the year was Rs. 1,71,801 against Rs. 1,78,041 in the previous year, the decrease of a little over Rs. 6,000 being due to smaller expendi- ture under the heads " superintendence " and " hospitals and dispensaries." 7. The thanks of the Governor and his Minister are due to Mr. Harris and Babu G. P. Sen for their efficient administration of the department. The latter was in charge of the duties of: the Superintendent for eight months during the absence of the former on leave. They are pleased to note the names of officers specially mentioned in the report and are glad to learn that the standard of work has been well maintained. ORDER.SHILLONG : Printed and published by O.

No. Rl-1REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, ASSAM, FOR THE YEAR 1928-29. PREFACE.2 PART I.3 9. One student from this province graduated from the Bengal Veterinary College in the previous year and joined the department during the year under report. PART II.4 17. Other contagious diseases.5 Altogether 4,790 animals were inoculated by the serum alone method. Forty-four deaths were reported amongst the inoculated animals. In the previous year inoculations were carried out in 252 outbreaks in 17 subdivisions and one Hill district (Khasi and Jaintia Hills). In these outbreaks 5,189 animals were reported to have died before inoculation. The total number of cattle inoculated was 15,308 of which 163 died after inoculation. 27. This year there was a smaller number of outbreaks and the disease was of a less virulent type. Sylhet district contributed the largest number of outbreaks and the greatest number of inoculations. In the previous year outbreaks of rinderpest were severe in the districts of Sylhet, Kamrup and Sibsagar and the greatest number of inoculations was done in tone Sylhet district. 23 Anthrax.6 31. Black quarter.7 medicines without the cases being seen is discouraged. Owners are encouraged to bring their animals to the hospitals for examination and treatment. 36 Gauhati veterinary hospital.8 PART IV.9 (2) Babu Srish Chandra Ghose, Veterinary Inspector, held tcharge of the Silchar circle throughout the year except for the period of one month from the 22nd May 1928 to 21st June 1928 when he was on leave. He was on tour for 138 days and travelled 3,174 miles by rail, 815 miles by steamer and 1,432 miles by road. He visited and re-visited 55 villages and Tea Estates in connection with the inspection of veterinary assistants' work, investigation of diseases and enquiry into the results of inoculations. The following hospitals and dispensaries were inspected by him:10 rail, 391 miles by steamer and 1,084 miles by road. He visited and re-visited 69 villages in connection with the inspection of veterinary assistants' work, investigation of diseases and enquiry into the results of inoculation. He inspected the following hospitals and dispensaries:11 PART V.12 49. The number of cruelty and maiming cases examined and reported on during the year and previous years is as follows:13 I regret to say, did not show any enthusiasm or interest in this work, which is so important in any scheme of cattle improve- ment. 53. The opportunity was taken of carrying out farther experimental treatment of surra. The method recommended by Dr. Edwards of the Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar, was tried this year. In this method intravenous and intra-thecal injections of Nagonal (Bayer 205) are given at definite intervals. The treatment extends over a month. Eleven horses were placed under treatment and of these eight appear to have been cured. Three died during the course of treatment from various causes. These results are much better than any previous efforts at treatment. The disadvantage of this method is that it is not one that can be carried out in the field. This drug was also used as a preventive in cases where valuable horses were exposed to infection. No definite decision as to the value of the drug for this object has been arrived at. No horse receiving preventive treatment acquired the disease, On the other hand other methods of prevention, e.g., eradicating biting flies, etc. were adopted at the same time. 54. For some years my attention has been drawn to the poor condition of many elephants including those of Government, The poor condition was usually found to be due to various intestinal and hepatic parasites and was characterised by emaciation and anæmia which gradually became more profound and complicated with dropsical swellings on various parts of the body. It was also found that when the clinical symptoms were at all advanced it was difficult to cure the animals so that they would be of further use and, death often supervened. With the object of getting these cases treated earlier and before any or only slight clinical symptoms were shown, the fæces of most of the Government elephants including those of the Forest Department have been examined from time to time. All veterinary assistants were instructed to forward specimens, and after examination a suitable treatment for the condition shown, was prescribed. It was found that all elephants were infested with various forms of Nematodes and when these became numerous the health of the host suffered. A considerable number of specimens showed that the liver was infested with a liver fluke14 in time have improved in health and condition. It is necessary to re examine each animal at various intervals. Instructions have also been issued to avoid as far as possible re-infection. 55. The Hon'ble Minister of Local Self-Government visited the veterinary hospital at Silchar during the year. 56. All the inspectors carried out their duties in a very satisfactory manner and the department owes much of its success to their keenness and ability. 57. Office staff.TABLE II.

REPORT ON THE VETERINARY ADMINISTRATION OF THE MANIPUR STATE FOR THE YEAR 1928-1929. 1. Personnel.31 5. In-patients.GOVERNMENT OF ASSAM. The Governor and the Minister of Education. Resolution on the Veterinary Report for the year 1928-29. Extract from the proceedings of the Government of Assam in the Education Department, No. 2282E., dated the 28th October 1929. READ2 inoculations were performed on 12,799 animals only 60 died after inoculation, while the reported number of deaths of uninoculated animals in these particular outbreaks was 2,197. The corre- sponding figures for the previous year in 284 outbreaks were 17,087, 163 and 5,380 respectively. 3. The strength of the staff, four veterinary inspectors and 64 veterinary assistant surgeons excluding one lent to the Iraq Government, remained unchanged. The Governor and his Minister have noted with pleasure the account of the good work done by the four inspectors and by the staff, itinerating and reserve veterinary assistant surgeons named. The veterinary assistant surgeons visited 10,561 villages, performed 4,430 castrations, and treated 21,389 cases for contagious diseases and 59,613 cases for non-contagious diseases, an increase over last year's figures of 694 villages visited, 2,767 animals castrated, 1,212 cases treated for contagious diseases and 6,316 for non- contagious diseases. The number of in and out patients treated at the three Government veterinary hospitals at Gauhati, Silchar and Shillong rose from 4,221 to 4,471 in the year under review. 4. Government have read with interest the acoount of the efforts made to promote the castration of weedy bulls. This work is assuming increasing prominence in the light of Royal Agricul- tural Commission's report and the endeavours which Government hope to make to improve the cattle of the province. The Governor and his Minister share the regret of the Superintendent that a considerable number of assistants did not show interest in castration, and expect the staff as a whole to support the Superin- tendent's campaign with enthusiasm in future. They are glad to hear of the successful experiments in the treatment of intestinal complaints among elephants, and of the progress made in the experimental treatment of surra by the method recommended by Dr. Edwards of the Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar. These advances were rendered possible by the comparative absence of epidemics and the decreased demand for inoculation. A large number of suspected poisoning cases amongst cattle was again observed by the veterinary assistant surgeons, especially in the Sunamganj circle. It is regrettable that according to reports received by Government the failure to secure definite evidence as to the facts, save in one case, is due to lack of co-operation by the cattle owners. 5. The total expenditure of the department during the year was Rs. 1,60,502 against Rs. 1,71,801 in 1927-28, the decrease being due to less expenditure under the head "hospitals and dispensaries."
3 6. The Governor and his Minister desire to acknowledge the work of Mr. Harris, who held charge throughout the year, and of his staff. They are glad to find that the standard of work was well maintained and that satisfactory progress was made. ORDER.SHILLONG: Printed and published by O. M.

Resolution on the Veterinary Report for the year 1929-30. Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Assam in the Education Department, No. 2754E., dated the 15th August 1930. READ2 2. The cost of the Department rose from Rs. 1,60,503 in the previous year to Rs. 2,04,305. This was largely clue to purchase of serum to cope with the wide-spread outbreaks of rinderpest which are mentioned below. Local boards also incurred expend- iture to the extent of Rs. 82,27b. The three Government hos- pitals at Gauhati, Silchar, and Shillong continued to do good work and some valuable tests were carried out at the Gauhati laboratory. A new Government hospital was opened at Sadiya during the year and the provision for permanent buildings for it has since been sanctioned. 3. The year was on the whole an unhealthy one, as cattle in the Surma Valley succumbed in large numbers to rinderpest on ac- count of their emaciated condition after the floods. Three reserve veterinary assistant surgeons were deputed to Karimganj, Kulaura and Sunamganj and other parts of the Surma Valley. In all 36,301 animals were inoculated, among whom 778 died after inoculation. The number of deaths previous to inoculation is reported to have been 17,924. Towards the close of the year enquiries were instituted into the prevalence of kumri and it is proposed to bring the matter up before the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. 4. As regards other diseases, there were 31 outbreaks of hæmorrhagic septicæmia in which 8 equines and 278 bovines were inoculated. Two bovines died after inoculation. Foot and mouth disease as usual occurred sporadically and was responsible for 2,353 deaths. Among horses glanders made an unwelcome reappearance after a period of six years and three horses had to be destroyed. Anthrax occurred in all districts and 61 horses and 733 cattle died from this disease. There was also an outbreak of surra in Manipur. 5. Veterinary stalls were opened at various fairs held throughout the province and attracted a good deal of attention but it must be admitted that more interest in the working of the Department on the part of local board members and of the general public would be a great encouragement to it. The Gover- nor and his Minister are anxious that the Department should give every assistance in the matter of cattle-breeding, both as regards propaganda for the construction of silos and stall feeding and also in the sterilization of undesirable bulls. Veterinary assistant surgeons could probably also give advice in the matter of cattle selection or obtain it from the Live-Stock and Dairy Expert. But there must be a readiness on the part of the public to avail themselves of such assistance.
3 6. The Governor acting with his Minister notes with pleasure the names of 8 veterinary assistant surgeons who have been specially mentioned for good work during the year. He is also indebted to Mr. Harris for his administration of the Department and to Babu Guru Prasanna Sen, the Superintendent in charge, for an interesting report.

No. R1-1/1844. FROM W. HARRIS, ESQ., M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., SUPERINTENDENT, CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, ASSAM, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ASSAM IN THE TRANSFERRED DEPART- MENTS, SHILLONG. Dated Gauhati, the 6th July 1931. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, for the year 1930-31, Your obedient servant, W. HARRIS, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Assam.
REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT ASSAM FOR THE YEAR 1930-31. PREFACE.2 5. In the laboratory at Gauhati 2,919 specimens of various kinds were examined microscopically during the year, of which 38 were diagnosed as Anthrax, 16 as Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and 8 as Surra. The remainder were examined for other blood, skin, and intestinal parasites, etc. From Khanapara Farm 1,863 specimens were examined. This was in connection with a campaign for the eradication of parasites from the alimentary tract which jeopardised the life and health of almost the entire herd. In the previous year 1,781 specimens were examined of which 48 were diagnosed as Anthrax, 61 as Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and 54 as Surra. PART I.3 9. Four students from this province4 15.

Rinderpest.6 and 2 others were reported to have died before inoculation. The number of animals inoculated were 218 equines, 1,182 bovines and 1 other of which only 2 bovines were reported to have died after inoculation. In the previous year inoculations were carried out in 43 outbreaks in 13 subdivisions. In these outbreaks 8 equines, 365 bovines and 57 others were reported to have died before inocu- lation. The number of animals inoculated was 166 equines 3,035 bovines and 14 others, of which 5 bovines were reported to have died after inoculation. 30. The submission of the monthly return of Anthrax out- breaks to the American Consul General in Calcutta was continued. 31. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.7 In the previous year inoculations were undertaken in 504 outbreaks in which 9 equines, 18,526 bovines and 60 others were reported to have died before inoculation. The number of animals inoculated was 174 equines, 42,143 bovines and 14 others, of which 785 bovines were reported to have died alter inoculation. 34. The submission of the monthly return showing the prevalence of Rinderpest and other contagious diseases to the Consul General for Italy in Calcutta was continued. ITINERANT VETERINARY ASSISTANT SURGEONS' WORK. 35. Table IV shows the work of the Staff, Itinerating and the Reserve Veterinary Assistant Surgeons during the year. They visited 11,035 villages, performed 12,233 castrations and treated 24,390 cases for contagious diseases and 63,037 cases for non- contagious diseases. In the previous year 10,701 villages were visited, 7,102 animals were castrated, 20,292 cases were treated for contagious diseases and 66,365 cases for non-contagious diseases. Nine dispensaries remained temporarily closed for short periods as Reserve Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were not available to fill the vacancies. VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. 36. Table V shows the work of the three Government Vete- rinary Hospitals at Gauhati, Silchar and Shillong. The total number of animals treated in the Hospitals during the year under report including both in-patients and out-patients was 4,640 against 4,277 in the previous year. The total number of cases supplied with medicines for treatment of animals not brought to the hospitals was 16 against 90 in the previous year. The distribution of medicines without the cases being seen is discouraged. Owners are encouraged to bring their animals to the hospitals for examination and treatment. 37. Gauhati Veterinary Hospital.8 88. Silchar Veterinary Hotpital.9 was on deputation to the Iraq Government returned on the 25th September 1930. One Veterinary Inspector retired from service on invalid pension. 44. A brief account of the work performed by the Veterinary Inspectors is given below :10 Shaistaganj, Habiganj and Patharkandi twice each. The work of the Staff and Reserve Veterinary Assistant Surgeons attach- ed to Silchar was also inspected by him. He attended the Camp Veterinary hospital opened during the Camp of Exercise of the Surma Valley Light Horse at Silchar. He inspected the breeding bulls in his circle and the live-stock in the Govern- ment Agricultural Farm at Akbarpur. (3) Babu Hem Chandra Sen, Veterinary Inspector, held charge of the Gauhati Circle No. I throughout the year. He was on tour for 179 days and travelled 1,379 miles by rail, 644 miles by steamer and 2,125 miles by road and boat. He visited and re-visited 102 villages in connection with the inspection of the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, investigation of diseases, enquiry into the result of inoculations, etc. He inspected the following hospital and dispensaries:11 for the rest of the period. Maulavi Azizuddin Sarkar was on tour for 4 days and travelled 138 miles by rail and 35 miles by road. He visited 3 villages and inspected the dispensaries at Barpeta once. Babu Bhudhar Chandra Chatterjee, Staff Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeon, Gauhati, held charge of the Gauhati Circle No. II from the 14th June 1930 to the 5th November 1930. He was on tour for 53 days and travelled 972 miles by rail, 498 miles by steamer and 347 miles by road and boat. The following dispensaries were inspected by him :12 (8) Babu Narendra Nath Dutta, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Silchar. (9) Maulavi Muhammed Brizish Quader, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Nowgong. (10) Srijut Surjya Lal Das, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, North Lakhimpur. (11) Babu Abani Kanata Dutta, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Sylhet. (12) Maulavi Sajidur Reza Laskar, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Shaistaganj. PART V.13 52. The following table shows the doses of the various sera received during the last 5 years :14 living with the local chamar had fled from the place. This year no suspected case of poisoning was reported from the Sunamganj Circle which showed the largest number during the previous three years. In the previous year there were 133 cases of suspect- ed poisoning, of which 121 died. 55. One elephant, one horse and 34 dogs were treated with anti-rabic vaccine supplied from the Pasteur Institute, Shillong. In the previous year 5 horses, 3 bullocks and 14 dogs were successfully treated. 56. The campaign for the castration of weedy bulls was continued during the year and for the third successive year showed a great increase. This year one Veterinary Assistant Surgeon passed the 600 mark (Srijut Bhabit Chandra Das, Dibru- garh) which is a creditable performance. I hope there will be more over this mark next year. Cattle owners are showing their appreciation of this method by bringing their bulls to dispensaries from considerable distances. The great majority of cases are done by Veterinary Assistant Surgeons when on tour. This is a great step forward in the scheme for the improvement of cattle. 57. The number of outbreaks of Surra were fewer this year and no opportunity was given to continue the treatment which was found successful last year. 58. During the last three years the Department has been carrying out experiments in the treatment of Anthrax in bovines by the intravenous injections of Arsenic and the definite conclu- sion has been reached that this treatment can save a large number of animals. 59. The regular examination of Government elephants for intestinal and hepatic parasites, which was mentioned in a pre- vious report, has been continued. This is found very necessary to keep the animals at work and in good condition. 60. The work of all the Veterinary Inspectors was carried out satisfactorily. It is greatly regretted that owing to lack of funds, their inspection work had to be curtailed and some Assis- tants were only inspected twice instead of four times during the year. This is a serious matter regarding the efficiency of the Department and to the Assistants who look forward to the Inspec- tor's visit for assistance and advice. 61. Office Staff.15 62. The Hon'ble Minister of Education visited the Tezpur Veterinary Dispensary during the year. 63. The Department wishes to thank the District Officers, members of the local boards and private gentlemen who have taken an interest in Veterinary work and the general welfare of cattle. We wish that there were more enthusiasts who would see the great opportunities that are possible for the enrichment and improvement of the country and people by the possession of better, healthier and more useful cattle.

The Governor and the Minister of Education. Resolution on the Veterinary Report for the year 1930-31. Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Assam in the Education Department, No. 2037 E., dated the 15th September, 1931. READ2 24,017 bovines and 1 other were inoculated against 174 equines, 42,143 and 14 others respectively in 1929-30. Five hundred and nine bovines died after inoculation in 1930-31 as against 785 in 1029-30. 3. The staff of 4 Veterinary Inspectors and 54 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons including the one deputed to Iraq was increased by 3 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeon on deputation to Iraq returned towards the middle of the year. His Excellency and his Minister have read with pleasure the account of good work done by the staff. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeons visited 11,035 villages, performed 12,233 castrations and treated 24,390 cases for contagious diseases and 63,037 cases for non-contagious diseases as against 10,701, 7,102, 20,292 and 66,365, respectively in the previous year. 4,640 cases of in-patients and out-patients were treated in the three Veterinary hospitals of Shillong, Gauhati and Silchar, as against 4,277 cases in the previous year. 4. The total expenditure of the department during the year was Rs. 1,81,667-0-7 as against Rs. 2,04,305-3-6 in the previous year, the decrease of about Rs. 22,000 being mainly due to a smaller expenditure under heads " Superintendence " and "Hospitals and Dispensaries ". 5. General progress of veterinary work was maintained in the year, and the campaign for castration of weedy bulls was con- tinued with greater vigour. Cattle owners seem to be alive to the necessity and cattle were brought to dispensaries from consider- able distances. The main work of castration was, however, done by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons while out on tour in the muffassil. Treatment of elephant for intestinal complaints was also successfully continued in the year. His Excellency and his Minister have noted with great satisfaction that the experiments in the treatment of anthrax in bovines by the intravenous injec- tions of arsenic have been successfully carried out and they share the hopes of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, that this treatment can save a large number of animals. Thanks of His Excellency and his Minister are due to Mr. Harris, for his efficient administration of the department. Ordered that a copy of the resolution be published in the Assam Gazette.

In the previous year inoculations were carried out in 12 outbreaks in 6 subdivisions. In those outbreaks 182 bovines were reported to have died before inoculation. The number of animals inoculated was 994 bovines of which one bovine was re- ported to have died after inoculation. 29. Black quater.7 VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. 33. Table V shows the work of the three Government Veteri- nary Hospitals at Gauhati, Silchar and Shillong. The total num- ber of animals treated in the hospitals daring the year under report including both in-patients and out-patients was 4,794 against 4,640 in the previous year. The total number of cases supplied with medicines for treatment of animals not brought to the hospitals was 36 against 16 in the previous year. The distri. bution of medicines without the cases being seen is discouraged. Owners are encouraged to bring their animals to the hospitals for examination and treatment. 34. Gauhati Veterinary Hospital.8 CATTLE FARMS. 39. There were three cattle breeding farms at work in this province during the year. They are placed at Upper Shillong, Sylhet and Khanapara and are under the control and manage- ment of the Agricultural Department. The farm stock were inspected when necessary by this department. 40. Upper Shillong Farm,9 45. A brief account of the work performed by the Veterinary Inspectors is given below :10 at Shillong and the dispensaries at Nowgong, Misa, Behaii and Sootea twice each. He inspected the cattle and poultry of the Government Agricultural Farm at Upper Shillong, the Munici- pal breeding bull of Nowgong and the elephants and transport bullocks of the 5th Assam Rifles at Lokra. He gave magic dantern demonstrations in 13 villages in his circle. (4) Babu Guru Prasanna Sen, Veterinary Inspector, held charge of the Gauhati Circle No. II, throughout the year. He was on tour for 86 days and travelled 1,348 miles by rail, 494 miles by steamer, and 918 miles by road and boat. He visited 76 villages in connection with the inspection of the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, investigation of diseases, enquiry into the result of inoculations and castrations, etc. He inspected the following hospital and dispensaries :11 (5) Srijut Jagadish Prasad Das, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Shillong.

(10) Babu Abani Kanta Dutta, Veterinary Assistant Sur- geon, Sylhet, (11) Maulavi Sajidur Reza Laskar, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Shaistaganj, PART V.12 52. This Department praticatty stairtei from zero in -1907, when ten Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were recruited and posted as follows :13 56. In regard to Surra recent discoveries were promptly adopted and animals can now be saved if the disease is discovered in time and the animal is not emaciated and weak. Horses exposed to infection can also be protected. 57. The Department has now treated successfully a large number of cases of Anthrax in bovines by intravenous injection of Arsenic. We are not aware that this treatment has as yet been generally adopted in other parts of India. 58. The work of the Laboratory has been greatly increased due to the routine examination of fæces, first from the cattle at the Government farms and second from Government elephants. It has been found that for treatment to be successful, the presence of parasites, e.g., the stomach worm of cattle and a hook worm of elephants must be diagnosed early and before clinical symptoms such as anæmia and dropsy are shown. 59. During these twenty-five years, the Department has gained the confidence of the public and every year a greater demand is made for its service. Unfortunately this demand can- not always be fully met owing to the limited number on the cadre. 60. It is of interest to note that up to date no case of tuber- culosis in cattle has been observed or reported. This satisfactory condition is probably due to the open air life the cattle live during the day and being housed in open sheds during the night It is satisfactory to know that the province is at present free from a disease of cattle which causes considerable loss, anxiety and expense to other countries. 61. During the year under review the general progress in veterinary work was continued and the standard maintained. Contagious diseases-in animals were not so prevalent or severe and consequently less inoculation work was required. 62. An adequate supply of serum was received from the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar. The following table shows the doses of the various Sera re- ceived during the last 5 years : 14 63. The number of cruelty and maiming cases examined and reported on during the year under report and previous years is as follows : 15 to 17,374 against 12,532 in the previous year. This year one Veterinary Assistant Surgeon (Maulavi Muhammad Brizish Qua- der, Nowgong) castrated 949 animals and 4 others passed the 600 mark which wa3 the highest individual number last year. 67. The number of outbreaks of Surra was again few and little opportunity was found to continue the treatment by Bayer 205 which proved so successful two years ago. 68. During the last two years, the attention of the Depart- ment has been drawn to the heavy mortality amongst poultry. Fowl cholera and fowl pox have always been more or less preva- lent at certain seasons of the year and have caused a considera- ble number of deaths. The recent and much heavier mortality seems to ho due to a new disease which has been spreading over India and found its way to Assam. It is known by several names16 wish to keep their stock fit and healthy must avoid grazing on these common grounds. The alternative is to have a private grazing ground, grow fodder crops and keep only a limited num- ber of healthy animals. 70. The work of all the Veterinary Inspectors was carried out satisfactorily. It is regretted that their inspection work had to be curtailed to effect economy in expenditure. For this reason work of many Veterinary Assistant Surgeons has been inspected twice or thrice instead of four times. It is hoped that circumstances will allow of the full number of inspections being made in the future, otherwise the standard of work cannot be maintained. 71.

GOVERNMENT OF ASSAM. The Governor and the Minister of Education. Resolution on the Veterinary Report for the year 1931-32. Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Assam in the Education Department, No. 3314E., dated the 10th September 1932. READ2 3. In the year under review the total number of deaths due to contagious disease among all kinds of animals in all districts excluding the Gauhati subdivision of the Kamrup district (figures wherefrom were not received in time) fell from 29,859 to 21,723. Outbreaks of rinderpest were fortunately less severe. Revision of the system of mortality reporting agencies is under considera- tion. 4. During the last two years there has been heavy mortality among poultry, due not only to fowl cholera and fowl pox but also to a new disease which appears to be spreading in Assam, known variously as the Newcastle disease, Ranikhet disease, fowl pest or Doyle's disease. At present there is no known method of cure or preventive inoculation, and segregation of the healthy birds, destruction and burial of the diseased birds and disinfection of the place seem to be the only remedies open. This year 175 birds were inoculated in an outbreak of fowl cholera. 5. In view of the increasing demand for veterinary services it is unfortunate that the staff of 4 Veterinary Inspectors and 57 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons cannot be strengthened during the present period of financial depression. Government are glad to learn that though the department's activities had in some respects to be curtailed owing to the need for economy, the standard of work has been maintained, and good progress made. In particu- lar, owing to the efforts of the Superintendent the number of bovines castrated by Veterinary officers rose to 16,278. His Excellency and his Minister endorse the remarks of the Superin- tendent that in the possession of better, healthier and more useful cattle lie very great opportunities for improving the general welfare of the province. They also agree that public grazing grounds, besides, being communicants of disease, are a very poor substitute for regular and proper feeding. 6. His Excellency and his Minister have noted with satisfac- tion the good work done by officers of the department. They are indebted to Mr. Harris for his efficient administration of the department and for his interesting report.

REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, ASSAM, FOR THE YEAR 1932-33. PREFACE.2 4. In the laboratory at Gauhati 1,940 specimens of various kinds were examined microscopically during the year. Of these 61 were diagnosed as Anthrax, 13 as Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, 49 as Surra and 3 as Johne's disease. The remainder were examined for other blood, skin and intestinal parasites, etc. From the Khanapara Government Farm 711 specimens were examined. In the previous year 2,305 specimens were examined of which 39 were diagnosed as Anthrax, 10 as Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and 14 as Surra; and from the Khanapara Farm 702 specimens were examined. PART I.10. The total mortality reported from contagious diseases during the year under report as compared with the previous two years is as follows :4 from 10 districts in the previous year. The number of outbreaks of this disease was greatest in the districts of Sylhet, Sibsagar, Lakhimpur and Nowgong. 18. Foot-and-mouth disease.5 26. During the year under report the outbreaks of Rinder- pest were greater than in the previous year. The districts of Sylhet, Sibsagar, Lakhimpur and Nowgong contributed the largest number of outbreaks and the greatest number of inocula- tions. In the previous year Sibsagar, Cachar and Lakhimpur districts contributed the largest number of outbreaks and the greatest; number of inoculations. 27. Anthrax.6 inoculated was 227 equines, 19,902 bovines and 21 others, of which one equine and 286 bovines were reported to have died after inoculation. In the previous year inoculations were undertaken in 261 outbreaks, in which 7 equines, 5,650 bovines and 11 others were reported to have died before inoculation. The total number of animals inoculated was 193 equines, 14,691 bovines and 107 others of which 395 bovines and 7 others were reported to have died after inoculation. 32. The submission of the monthly return showing the prevalence of Rinderpest and other contagious diseases to the Consul General for Italy in Calcutta was continued. ITIENRANT VETERINARY ASSISTANT SURGEONS' WORK. 33. Table IV shows the work of the staff, Itinerating and the Reserve Veterinary Assistant Surgeons during the year. They visited 11,227 villages, performed 20,987 castrations and treated 19,892 cases for contagious diseases and 72,342 cases for non-contagious diseases. In the previous year 10,685 villages were visited, 17,062 animals were castrated, 16,129 cases were treated for contagious diseases and 68,911 cases for non-conta- gious diseases. One hill district dispensary remained temporarily closed for a short period as no substitute could be arranged. VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. 34. Table V shows the work of the three Government Vete- rinary Hospitals at Gauhati, Silchar and Shillong. The total number of animals treated in the hospitals during the year under report including both in-patients and out-patients was 5,201 against 4,794 in the previous year. The total number of cases supplied with medicines for treatment of animals not brought to the hospitals was 53 against 36 in the previous year. The distribution of medicines without the cases being seen is discouraged. Owners are encouraged to bring their animals to the hospitals for examination and treatment. 35.

(3) Babu Hem Chandra Sen, Veterinary Inspector, held charge of the Gauhati Circle No. I, with his headquarters at Gauhati throughout the year except the period from the 1st April 1932 to the 15th May 1932 when he was on leave and Babu Bhudhar Chandra Chatterjee, Staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Gauhati, was in charge from the 29th April 1932 to the 15th May 1932. Babu Hem Chandra Sen also held charge of the Gauhati Circle No. II for the period from the 1st August 1932 to the 30th September 1932 in addition to his own duties. He was on tour for 161 days and travelled 668 miles by rail, 772 miles by steamer and 1,995 miles by road and boats. He visited and re-visited 125 villages in connection with inspection of the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, investigation of diseases, etc. He inspected the following hospital and dispensaries :10 His tour was very much curtailed owing to Mr. Harris' absence from headquarters during the 1st four months of the year. Babu Bhudhar Chandra Chatterjee, Staff Veterinary Assist- ant Surgeon, Gauhati, held charge of the Gauhati Circle No. II as an officiating Veterinary Inspector from the 1st October 1932 to the end of the year. During this period he was on tour for 74 days and travelled 1,160 miles by rail, 252 miles by steamer and 1,020 miles by road and boat. He visited and re-visited 84 villages in connection with inspection of the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, investiga- tion of diseases, enquiry into the result of inoculation and castration, etc. He inspected the following hospital and dis- pensaries :11 (6) Babu Lalit Mohan Das Gupta, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Sootea.

An adequate supply of serum and other products was received from the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar. The following table shows the doses of the various sera and products received during the last five years 13 of which 153 in Habiganj, 120 in Goal para, 120 in Shaistaganj and 30 in Maulvibazar died. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, Habiganj, Shaistaganj and Maulvibazar suspected the local chamars and threatened to report against them, and advised the villagers to slash the skins of the dead cattle and bury them and not to allow the chamars to take them. No further cases of poisoning occurred after this action. In the previous year there were 415 cases of suspected poisoning amongst cattle of which 409 died. The largest numbers were 131 in Habiganj, 90 in Maulvibazar, 85 in Shaistaganj and 69 in Nalbari all of which died except one in Nalbari. 57. During the year under report 2 horses, 2 bullocks and 39 dogs were treated successfully with anti-rabic vaccine supplied from the Pasteur Institute, Shillong. The number would have been much greater if the vaccine were available free of cost to the poor cultivators. In the previous year one horse and 12 dogs were treated with anti-rabic vaccine successfully. 58. In combating Rinderpest, serum simultaneous method of inoculation could not have been introduced except on Govern- ment farms. The new method of vaccination called virus alone method was started during the year as an experimental basis and the result obtained was promising and the Department wishes to adopt this method more widely as soon as funds are available for a separate staff for the purpose. In the meantime the work will be continued as far as possible with the existing staff when oppor- tunity occurs. The present procedure of serum alone method of inoculation combined wi!h infection with saliva and urine will be continued until the new method can replace if. 59. During the year under report the epidemic of surra was greater than in the previous year ; and where the owner consented to pay the cost of medicines and the condition of the affected animal was not gone too far, the curative treatment was adopted. The demand of such treatment was greater during the year which indicates that a time is approaching when a separate staff for treatment of surra cases may be necessary. The course of the treatment extends for a month in each case and consequently it is inconvenient for the Local Board Veterinary Assistant burgeons to undertake this treatment without detriment to their other work. 60. The death amongst the fowl from the diseases as mentioned in the previous year seems to have been much less this year. 61. The Department continued the treatment of cases of Anthrax in bovines by intravenous injection of Arsenic with successful result.
14 62. The work of the laboratory has been greatly increased and the services of the Staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Gauhati, were fully occupied in the laboratory work. This has deprived the Department of the services of a Staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeon for which his services wore primarily intended. A separate arrangement is, therefore, necessary for laboratory work including the receipt and despatch of sera. 63. No case of Tuberculosis was observed in this province so long but towards the close of the year under report a para- tubercular disease (Johne's disease) was found amongst the Sindhi cattle at the Government Cattle Farm at Khanapara. So far as investigation was carried out this disease was not seen amongst the indigenous cattle but owing to the insufficient staff a thorough investigation could not be held and so it is still uncertain whether the cattle that die of obstinate diarrhoea has not had Johne's disease in them along with the common disease known as parasitic diarrhoea. 64. Glanders in the province was very rarely noticed since a long time but during the year a good number was found in the transport ponies of Assam Rifles stationed in the Lushai Hills. The origin was traced and found to be imported from Burma from which place some animals were purchased. 65. The Department has gained much popularity and its services are very much appreciated by the people who could realise that the small number of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons employed in each subdivision is quite insufficient in consideration of the area and the number of cattle in it. Out of 19 subdivisions 3 have entertained three Veterinary Assistant Surgeous each, one entertained only one and the rest entertained 2 each. The finan- cial crisis has driven some Local Boards to suggest for curtail- ment of the existing number of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons under them but there are some who in spite of financial depression are endeavouring to increase their number as they thought it was their essential duty to help the rate-payers15 67. The work of all the Veterinary Inspectors was carried out satisfactorily. It is regretted their inspection had to be cur- tailed to sometextent to effect economy in expenditure. For this reason work of some Veterinary Assistant Surgeons was inspected thrice or twice or even once instead of four times. It is hoped that circumstances will allow of the full number of inspections being made in future, otherwise the standard of work cannot be maintained. 68. The Hon'ble the Minister of Education visited the Vete- rinary Dispensary at Goalpara during the year. 69.

Orders by the Governor and the Minister of Education. Resolution on the Veterinary Report for the year 1932-33. Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Assam in the Education Department, No. 2108E., dated the 20th September 1938. READ2 the " serum alone " method. The more effective but costly "serum simultaneous " method was more or less confined to the Government cattle farms. This in its turn has latterly given place to the " virus alone " method which combines the advan- tages of the " serum simultaneous " method with the additional advantage of cheapness. In view of the debates in the last March session of the Legislative Council Government are con- sidering the question of extending the benefit of these new methods of inoculation to other areas where there is demand for them, and the Superintendent's proposal for an increase in his staff is at present under consideration. 3. Efforts to improve the cattle were continued from the Veterinary side. They must be considered as being supple- mentary to the measures taken in the Live-stock branch of the Department of Agriculture. The number of castrations done during the year was greater than in the preceding year. Govern- ment share the Superintendent's disappointment for the number of breeding bulls maintained by local bodies being so small. The smallness of the number was perhaps due to the fact that local bodies were not aware that the Agricultural Department was in a position to supply more bulls. Government have lately brought to the notice of the local bodies the readiness of the Agricultural Department to supply bulls. 4. In an agricultural province like Assam where man's life is so much bound up with that of cattle, it is essential that people should know more about breeding and taking care of cattle and further that for cases of illness there should be adequate facilities available for treatment. The appreciation of what little is done by the Veterinary staff is encouraging and should stimulate the staff to further effort. It must be conceded that the cattle in the province have so far not had their due share of attention and that the long leeway can only be made up if the boards seriously consider the question of increasing their Veterinary staff. Though one board has been unfortunately compelled to curtail its activities temporarily under pressing financial necessity, Government hope that even that board will retrace its steps at the earliest opportunity and join the rest in extending the beneficent services of Veterinary officers. 5. With the help of the funds provided mainly by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research Government have engaged the services of a qualified Disease Investigating Officer who will shortly take up a survey of the diseases prevalent among cattle in Assam and carry out clinical investigations in the particular areas where chronic disease and degeneration of stock is met with. Government have also drawn up a scheme on animal
3 nutrition research for the consideration of the Imperial Council of Agriculture. It provides for research work in regard to deficiency of nutrients and mineral content in local feed stuffs and the infestation of animals with internal parasites. This scheme, if sanctioned, along with the work of the Disease Investigating Officer should at the end of the experimental period of five years yield results which will be of use in the preservation and improvement of cattle. 6. The strength of the staff remained the same as during 1931-32. Though financial conditions remained had and rigid economy affected the touring of inspecting officers, it is satisfac- tory to observe that the outturn of work of the Veterinary Assis- tants was greater than during the previous year. His Excellency and his Minister have noted with satisfaction the good work done by officers of the Department. They are indebted to Mr. Harris and to Mr. Sen who was in charge of the Department for the greater part of the year, for their efficient administration.

No. R1-1/1810. FROM BABU GURU PRASANNA SEN, G. B. V. C., OFFG. SUPERINTENDENT, CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, ASSAM. To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ASSAM IN THE TRANSFERRED DEPART- MENTS, SHILLONG. Dated Gauhati, the 4th July 1934. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Annual Adminis- tration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, for the year 1933-34. Your obedient servant, G. P. SEN, Offg. Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Assam.
REPORT OF THE Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, for the year 1933-34 PREFACE.2 5. In the laboratory at Gauhati 2,564 specimens of various kinds were examined microscopically during the year. Of these 78 were diagnosed as Anthrax, 13 as Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, 49 as Surra and 6 as Johne's disease. The remainder were examined for other blood, skin and intestinal parasites, etc. From the Khanapara Government Farm 966 specimens were examined during the year. In the previous year 1,940 specimens were examined of which 51 were diagnosed as Anthrax, 13 as Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, 49 as Surra and 8 as Johne's disease From the Khanapara Farm 711 specimens were examined. VETERINARY INVESTIGATION OFFICER. 6. A post of Veterinary Investigation Officer subsidised by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research was created for this province during the year for a period of 5 years and Mr. P. G. Pande, M.SC., m.r.c.v.s., was appointed to hold it. According to the terms of the scheme he joined the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research at Muktesar on 26th April 1933 for a course of training in different sections of the Institute for a period of six months. On the completion of the course of training Mr; Pande joined his duties in this province with headquarters at Gauhati on the 6th November 1933. The officer has been placed under the direct control of the Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, and has been provided with separate office establishment and accommodation with necessary instruments, appliances, etc. He has begun the work of investigation in some of the diseases that are very com- monly seen amongst cattle and ponies. PART I.3 11. Three unemployed Veterinary graduates of 1931 were employed during the year4 16. Epizootic Lymphangitis.5 OTHER ANIMALS. 27. Contagious diseases amongst other animals.6 In the previous year inoculations were carried out in 32 out- breaks in 13 subdivisions. In these outbreaks 8 equines, 235 bovines and 16 others were reported to have died before inocula- tion. The number of animals inoculated was 227 equines, 1,227 bovines and one other of which one equine and 3 bovines were reported to have died after inoculation. 32. The submission of the monthly return of Anthrax out- breaks to the American Consul-General in Calcutta was continued. 33. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.7 ITINERANT VETERINARY ASSISTANT SURGEONS' WORK. 37. Table IV shows the work of the staff, Itinerating and the Reserve Veterinary Assistant Surgeons during the year. They visited 11,287 Villages, performed 23,542 castra- tions and treated 22,851 cases for contagious diseases and 69,520 cases for non-contagious diseases. In the previous year 11,227 Tillages were visited, 20,987 animals were castrated, 19,892 cases were treated for contagious diseases and 72,342 cases for non-contagious diseases. Three dispensaries remained tempora- rily closed for short periods as no substitute could be arranged. VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. 38. Table V shows the work of the three Government Veterinary Hospitals at Gauhati, Silchar and Shillong. The total number of animals treated in the hospitals during the year under report including both in and out-patients was 5,632 against 5,201 in the previous year. The total number of cases supplied with medicines for treatment of animals not brought to the hospitals was 136 against 53 in the previous year. The distribution of medicines to the owners living at a reasonable distance from the hospital without the cases being seen is discouraged. Owners are encouraged to bring their animals to the hospitals for examination and treatment. 39. Gauhati Veterinary Hospital.8 42. During the year under report a sum of Rs. 1,103-14-0 was realised in the Veterinary Hospitals as hospital fees and credited to the treasuries against a sum of Rs 1,032 in the previous year. Besides this a sum of Rs. 443-12-0 was realised at headquarters as cost of treatment for Surra and Piroplasmosis and inoculations undertaken at the request of the owners in the absence of outbreaks, and credited to the treasury against a sum of Rs. 82-4-0 in the previous year. PART III.9 48 In view of the large number of valuable pedigree stock that is maintained in each Government Cattle Farm and constant sickness amongst them it is desirable that the Live-stock Branch of the Agricultural Department should have at least one Vete- rinary Officer in each farm under professional control of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam. CATTLE FAIRS AND SHOWS. 49. Table XIV shows the number of cattle fairs and shows held during the year. There were nothing of much importance to note in these fairs. In one place a Veterinary stall was opened by a Veterinary Inspector with the assistance of local Veterinary Assistant Surgeons where lectures on cattle welfare were given, Veterinary pamphlets were distributed and demon- strations with Magic Lanterns were made on various points relating to cattle diseases and their prevention, etc. The people showed much interest in these affairs which indicates the useful- ness of such functions. PART IV.10 travelled 3,864 miles by rail, 126 miles by steamer and 2,491 miles by road and boat. He visited and re-visited 384 villages and tea estates in connection with inspection of the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, investigation of diseases, demonstration of castrations, enquiry into the results of inocula- tion, castration, treatment of cases, etc. He inspected the following dispensaries :11 Babu Bhudkar Chandra Chatterjee, Officiating Veterinary Inspector, Gauhati Circle No. II, while in charge of Gauhati Circle No. I in addition to his own duties visited Nowgong and Misa in connection with outbreaks of Surra and Rinderpest. Babu Hem Chandra Sen, Veterinary Inspector, held charge of the Gauhati Circle No I, from the 1st to the 3rd April 1933, and visited Khanapara Farm twice in testing some cases for Johne's disease. (3) Babu Hem Chandra Sen, Veterinary Inspector, held charge of the Silchar Circle with headquarters at Silchar through- out the year except the period from 1st to 6th April 1933 when the circle was without an Inspector. He was on tour for 191 days and travelled 3,179 miles by rail, 416 miles by steamer and 1,603 miles by road and boat. He visited and re-visited 128 villages in connection with the inspection of the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, investigation of diseases and enquiry into thf3 results of inoculation, castrations, etc. He inspected the following hospital and dispensaries:12 Gauhati and the dispensaries at Goalpara, Bilashipara and Dhubri four times each, Patacharkuchi and Sukchar thrice each, and Bar- peta and Abhoyapuri twice each. He visited the Khanapara Agricultural Farm and carried out testing of the cattle for Johne's disease. He inspected and supervised the work of the Staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeon and the Reserve Veterinary Assistant Surgeons at Gauhati. While at headquarters he worked in the Laboratory and imparted necessary instructions to the Reserve Veterinary Assistant Surgeons about their work. 53. The number of Reserve Veterinary Assistant Surgeons was increased temporarily during the year from 10 to 12. 1 wo posts were sanctioned temporarily with effect from the 1st November 1933 for work in connection with the virus alone method of inoculation against Rinderpest. Two Reserve Veter- inary Assistant Surgeons were as usual employed in charge of the two hospitals at Gauhati and Silchar and the rest were em- ployed on leave vacancies and on deputation to supplement the local staff during outbreaks of cattle disease. 54. The number of Staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeons em- ployed during the year was 2 as in the previous year, with head- quarters at Silchar and Gauhati. 55. The names of the following Veterinary Assistant Sur- geons are noted for their good and steady work : 13 (9) Babu Abani Kanta Dutta, Reserve Veterinary Assis- tant Surgeon, Silchar. (10) Babu Lalit Mohan Das Gupta, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Sootea. (11) Srijut Joy Ram Borcloloi, Veterinary Assistant Sur- geon, Tangla. (12) Maulavi Fariduddin Ahmed, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Tinsukia. (18) Babu Debendra Nath Chatterjee, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Kulaura. PART V.14 59. An adequate supply of serum was received from the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar. The following table shows the doses of the various sera received during the year under report and previous years : 15 practice sometimes take the advantage of epidemic as was noticed in Nalbari Circle during the year under report. In the previous year there were 549 cases of suspected poisoning amongst cattle of which 455 died. The largest number was 203 in Habiganj, Goalpara, Shaistnganj and Maulvibazar came next with 150, 120 and 38 cases respectively of which the number of death reported was 153 in Habiganj, 120 in Goalpara, 120 in Shais- taganj and 30 in Maulvibazar. 62. During the year under report 1 cow and 36 dogs were treated successfully with anti-rabic vaccine obtained from the Pasteur Institute, Shillong. In the previous year 2 horses, 2 bullocks and 89 dogs were treated successfully. This treatment has found a check owing to the following two reasons, viz, (1) so long a great number of dogs used to be treated but lately the Pasteur Institute, Shillong, has suggested destruction of dogs bitten by rabid dogs and (2) the price of vaccine for cattle is prohibitive and the cattle owners with all their intention to have their animals treated cannot afford to pay the cost of the vaccine specially because the value of cattle has since fallen greatly. Unless the vaccine is supplied free to the indigent owners they will be deprived of the benefit obtainable by this treatment. 63. The most prominent feature of the Department was the expansion of the work in the virus alone method of inoculation against Rinderpest. In the previous year this method was tried as an experimental measure on a small number of animals in the Government Farms and in a Tea garden, and the efficacy of the method so far obtained induced the Government to sanction a special staff of two Reserve Veterinary Assistant Surgeons temporarily for one year for the purpose with effect from the 1st November 1933. With this increased facility the Department was able to carry out inoculation of 2,773 animals by this method. It is interesting to note that the result so far obtained is so promising that the public has already begun to appreciate this method and the demand was greater than what could be met with the staff available for the purpose. This indicates as noted in my report for the year 1932-33 that a separate permanent staff exclusively for this purpose is an impending necessity. Pending the creation of this staff the temporary staff as sanctioned by the Government for one year, I think, shall have to be maintained still further. Since the close of the year a further advance has been made in the matter by obtaining a modified Rinderpest virus locally from affected cattle in a natural outbreak. The result so far obtained is encouraging and the experiment deserves further trial.
16 A. scheme for further investigation of efficacy of the virus alone method of inoculation against Rinderpest on different breeds of cattle under different environments and conditions was submitted to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. The Advisory Board of the Council has in its last meeting acknowledged the importance of this scheme as an All-India problem and provisionally accepted the scheme, which provides for the entertainment of four Veterinary Assistant Surgeons for the purpose to work under the Veterinary Investigation Officer for three years. 64. The treatment of Surra cases increased considerably. It is gratifying to note that the public has learnt to appreciate the curative treatment of Surra so well that many of them agree to get their ponies treated on advance payment of the cost of medicine. 65. The treatment of Anthrax cases with arsenic was conti- nued. Besides this, Anthrax and Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia cases were also treated with camphor with excellent results. The treatment with this drug gives a good facility to the cattle owners as the medicine is available almost everywhere and the administration is so easy that it can be carried out by the owners themselves. 66. As reported last year Johne's disease was first detected in Assam in 1932 in the Government Cattle Farm at Khanapara. During the year under report more cases were found at the Khanapara Farm as well as amongst the animals in the Jorhat Government Cattle Farm and in Nowgong Jail Dairy, where these animals were caused to migrate from the Khanapara Farm. It is therefore evident that the Khanapara Farm has become a nucleus for the disease. The Veterinary Investigation Officer has been entrusted with further investigation on this disease with special reference to indigenous cattle, among which so far no case has been detected. 67. This province offers an excellent field for investigation into diseases of animals of various kinds specially of parasitic origin, but so long the Department was handicapped for want of adequate staff. It is however gratifying to note that a Veterinary Investigation Officer has been appointed for this province for this purpose and he has taken up his work since November 1933. 68. It is regrettable to note that at a time when the Depart- ment has gained much popularity and the demands for service and its appreciation are greater than ever the North Sylhet Local Board owing to their adverse financial condition had to suspend the entertainment of the two Government Veterinary Assistant
17 Surgeons placed under them and appointed a Veterinary Assis- tant Surgeon of their own. While two Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were not sufficient for the subdivision covering an unwieldy jurisdiction with seven thanas where the numerical strength of live-stock was over 2,00,000, the measure taken by the Board was undoubtedly a retrograde step, as was apparent from the complaints received from the rate payers. The result of this economy in the Board's expenditure will continue to be a matter of considerable inconvenience and loss to the poor cattle owners of the Subdivision. The earlier the number of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons is increased by the Board the better for their rate payers. It is however gratifying to note that three more Local Boards have decided to entertain a third Veterinary Assis- tant Surgeon under each of them ; of these one Board has already employed a third Veterinary Assistant Surgeon after the close of the year under report and the other two Boards would give effect to their decision as soon as funds would permit. Haila- kandi Local Board still continued to maintain only one Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeon, while complaints were received from the cattle owners about the insufficiency of staff. 09. The campaign of castration of weedy bulls was conti- nued during the year. The total number of castrations rose to 23 873 from 21,272 in the previous year. This shows the grow- ing popularity of the operation amongst the mass. As this is a measure towards improvement of live stock of the province the work would gradually shift to the Live stock Department, which it is understood has commenced it. This arrangement will afford the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons of the Department more time for the treatment of the sick and other departmental work of scientific interest. To secure the best results it is desirable that necessary measure be taken for sterilising weedy bulls before they get matured and for placing good bulls amongst the herd. 70. The work of all the Veterinary Inspectors was carried out satisfactorily. This year also due to economy in expenditure the full number of inspections could not be carried out on all the dispensaries and hospitals. As a recognition of his good work Babu Srish Chandra Ghose, Veterinary Inspector, had conferred upon him the well merited title of Rai Sahib during the year Under report. 71. During the year under report the Hon'ble the Minister of Education visited the Veterinary Dispensary at Nalbari.

READ2 as well as in the lower ranks, but financial difficulties preclude any immediate steps in either direction. 2. The Veterinary servicer co-operated with the work of the Government Cattle Farms in the attempt to secure improve- ment in the cattle breeds of the province. It is satisfactory to observe that parasitic troubles at Khanapara have been reduced. The discovery of Johne's disease among imported animals is a serious matter which will require careful watch. An interesting suggestion by the Superintendent that Veterinary Assistant Surgeons should be posted at the farms must receive considera- tion when it becomes possible to contemplate expansion of staff. 3. It is suggested in the report that the anti-rabic vaccine should, be supplied free in order to encourage preventive inocula- tion of animals. There are difficulties in the way of free supply, but a reduction in price is under consideration of Government, and the conditions on which inoculation is done are also being reviewed. 4. Government have read the report with much interest, and acknowledge the unsparing efforts! of the Superintendent and numerous members of his staff in the cause of animal life. The loss of Mr. Harris, who had been in charge of the Depart- ment for so many years, was very seriously felt, but the progress achieved has been worthily maintained and a measure of advance secured by his successor.

No. R1-1/2267. From RAI SAHIB SRISH CHANDRA GHOSE, G.B.V.C., SUPERINTENDENT, CIVIL VETERINARY DEPART- MENT, ASSAM. To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ASSAM IN THE TRANSFERRED DEPART- MENTS, SHILLONG. Dated Gauhati, the 2nd July 1936. Sir, I have the honour to submit herewith the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, for the year 1935-36. Your obedient servant, S. C. GHOSE, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Assam.
Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, for the year 1935-36 PREFACE.2 Veterinary Investigation Officer. Out of these, 56 were diag- nosed as Anthrax, 32 as Hæmorrhagic Septicaemia, 59 as Surra, 3 as Black-quarter, 1 as Fowl Cholera, 1 as Dirofilaria Immitis in a dog and 34 as Johne's disease. The remainder were examined for other blood, skin, and intestinal parasites, etc. From the Khanapara Farm 682 specimens were examined during the year. In the previous year 2,405 specimens were examined of which 44 were diagnosed as Anthrax, 13 as Hæmorrhagic Septicaemia, 12 as Surra, 8 as Black-quarter, 1 as Fowl Cholera and 5 as Johne's disease. From the Khanapara Farm 667 specimens were examined during the year. VETERINARY INVESTIGATION OFFICER. 6. Mr. P. G. Pande, M. Sc., M. R. C. V. S., continued to hold the post of the Veterinary Investigation Officer, Assam, throughout the year. He was on tour for 158 days and travelled 2,078 miles by road and 720 miles by rail. The rest of the days in the year were utilised for work at the Khanapara Government Cattle Breeding Farm in connection with Johne's disease. He visited 20 villages, 4 Tea Estates, 3 Government Farms and 2 Jails for the purpose of investigation of animal diseases. Forty- two specimens of all kinds were despatched to the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, for examination and confirmation during the year under report. 7. He attended the Animal Husbandry Research Workers' Conference held in new Delhi in February 1936. 8. The following diseases were investigated by him during the year:3 10. The Department proposes to conduct further investi- gation through the Veterinary Investigation Officer on the diseases he undertook during the year under report, more parti- cularly Johne's disease, which is growing to be an increasing menace in Assam. VETERINARY INSTRUCTION. 11. During the year under report the number of students who attended the Bengal Veterinary College, Calcutta, was 6. Of these two were Government stipendiaries who had been promoted to the 2nd year class and 4 were private students. Amongst the private students one passed the final examination of the College and one was promoted to the 2nd year class and two others were detained in the 1st year class. There was no Local Board stipendiary from this province in the college during the year. The passed veterinary graduate has since the close of the year joined the Livestock section of the Agricultural Department in Assam, so that no qualified graduate was available for employ ment in this Department.

Table V is a review of the work done in the three Government Veterinary Hospitals in the province, viz., Gau- hati, Silchar and Shillong. It is interesting to report that the number of patients treated in these institutions during the year under review showed a distinct advance over that of the last year. What is more gratifying is that the receipts of each of these institutions this year compared favourably despite the fact that the country has been passing through an economic depres- sion. This is a clear evidence that the service rendered by these institutions is daily growing in popularity. Total number of in and out-patients treated this year was 5,862 as opposed to 5,544 of the last year. It should be mentioned here that these are excluding the cases for which medicines were supplied free of charge but were not actually presented in the hospitals. Hospital receipts went up this year to Rs. 1,217-12-0 against Rs. 1,055-0-0 of the last year. This amount does not include Rs. 123-12-0 (against Rs. 133-4-0 of the last year) received as cost of certain special treatment. It should be recorded that both the number of patients and hospital receipts this year are the highest as compared with any of the preceding ten years. 35. Gauhati Veterinary Hospital.8 PART III.9 PART IV.10 Assistant Surgeons, investigation of diseases and inoculation of cat- tle against Rinderpest by the goat virus method. He inspected the following Veterinary Dispensaries :11 (3) Maulavi Azizuddin Sarkar, Veterinary Inspector, held charge of the Dibrugarh Circle throughout the year. He was on tour for 265 days and travelled 2,701 miles by rail and 4,763 miles by road and boat. He visited and revisited 501 villages and Tea Estates in connection with inspection of the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, investigation of diseases, demon- stration of castration and enquiry into the results of inoculation, castration and treatment of cases and in conducting and super- vising the work of virus inoculation against Rinderpest. He had most trying time in combating the heavy and wide-spread epidemic of Rinderpest in the Sibsagar District during the year under report. He inspected the following dispensaries :12 43. The demand for extra help from the districts was so great that it was not always possible to meet it with the Reserve at disposal of the Deparment. 44. There were two staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeons as usual, one with headquarters at Gauhati and another at Silchar, whose services were particularly utilised for special work, the demand for which was great. THE SCIENTIFIC AND OTHER IMPORTANT WORK CARRIED OUT DURING THE YEAR. 45. The following scientific work of importance was dealt with by this Department during the year 1935-36, besides the ordinary professional work of a routine nature :13 PAPT V.14 While 65,000 doses of Rinderpest Serum had to be purchased during the first three months of the year under report not a single drop of the serum has been purchased since the close of the year up till now notwithstanding the fact that epidemics are prevalent both in the Assam Valley and the Surma Valley. To illustrate the savings specifically it may be mentioned that the cost of the serum per thousand plain Assam cattle is Rs. 400 as opposed to Rs. 6 of the vaccine for the same number of animals. The magnitude of the benefit will be better under- stood when it is said that occurrence of Rinderpest is rather too frequent in Assam and that more than half of the total mortality of cattle in Assam every year is due to Rinderpest. The change would thus amount not only to an active protection of the stock against the scourge of so fell a disease as Rinderpest but also to an annual saving of several thousand rupees which were hitherto spent for the purchase of costly and less protective Anti-Rinder- pest Serum. Experiments are in progress to test the degree of reaction produced by the Goat Virus in hill bred and cross bred English cattle and in highly susceptible buffaloes in Assam. In March last the Staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Gauhati, was deputed to Imphal to test the degree of susceptibility of the Manipuri cattle to the virus. The result obtained is encouraging and promising to be of great help both to the department and the State. More extensive experiments are in contemplation. 49. Another signal success which the department claims this year is a simple six days' short course treatment of equine Surra which proved almost 100 per cent. a success as opposed to a complicated five weeks' course treatment of distinctly lesser efficacy hitherto followed. Further experiment of the treatment is contemplated this year if opportunity occurs. Indeed the result so far obtained is so full of promise that destruction of horses under the Glanders and Farcy Act for Surra should be a past history. The department encountered this year for the first time in its history in the province two very wide and serious outbreaks of Bovine Trypanosomiasis and is in a position to report that it was able to combat the epidemics with Antim Pot. Tart, treatment intravenously, both as curative and preventive. 50. Johne's disease continued to be an increasing menace to the stock of the Government Farms and Jail Dairies and amongst those issued or sold from the Farms. Government were pleased to appoint a Committee of enquiry and advice
15 headed by Mr. F. Ware, F.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Director, Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, towards the latter part of 1935, as a result of letter No. 3169, dated the 16th September 1935, from this department to the Director of Agriculture, Assam. The Committee finished its labour early in January last and agreed with the recommendations of this department in all essential points. Action is being taken according to the recommendation of the Committee. The disease was not found in the village herds during the year under report. This corroborates the finding of my predecessors, which was also confirmed by the Ware Committee. 51. It needs hardly be emphasised that serious contagious diseases of livestock act as deterrent towards the progress of the animal industry in the province and has a great direct bearing on the Agriculture, dairy produce, public health and economic condition of the province which exert considerable influence upon the general welfare and more particularly upon the revenue paying capacity of the ryots. It is therefore of paramount importance to educate the illiterate cultivators who form the great bulk of the livestock owners in the matter of prevention of epidemic diseases and in all other matters concerning the general welfare of the livestock. Intensive educative propa- ganda work in rural areas with lantern lectures, by cattle show, exhibition, demonstration of models, charts, diagrams and pathological specimens and distribution of leaflets would go a great way to gain the end. Inclusion of subjects containing instructions about general welfare of livestock, particularly of cattle, in the curriculum of primary and secondary schools should form another line of work in this direction. The present staff maintained by the department is inadequate to meet the demand for the routine work. It is therefore necessary to have a propaganda section of the Veterinary Department. This section should form the nucleus of the future " Animal Health Branch " of public service in the Veterinary Department. 52. A very heavy increase in the number of specimens received in the Laboratory for microscopical examination during the year is another feature worth mentioning. As many as 3,653 specimens of various kinds were examined during the year under report against 2,405 of the year before. These are excluding the specimens which were examined by the Veterinary Investigation Officer during the course of his investigation. A fee for examination of specimens sent by or for private parties and not in connection with control of epidemics and scheduled diseases is now charged.
16 53. Departmental activities in every direction have during the recent years so enormously increased both in volume and in importance that without the least exaggeration it may be said that it has already grown an absolute necessity to relieve the Superintendent of a considerable part of his office and technical work of routine nature to let him free for more important technical and administrative work. It is therefore no more consistent with efficiency to keep the post of the Deputy Superin- tendent vacant. It is extremely unfortunate that the present financial position stands in the way of materialising the idea. Similarly in view of overwhelmingly increasing demand for Veterinary aid by the public which the present staff can hardly adequately deal with, the original programme of maintaining two Veterinary Assistant Surgeons by each Local Board needs immediate revision if the department is to be run with any degree of efficiency. There is no good hiding the fact that the department goes to-day very much less appreciated than it deserves for insufficiency of staff. While four of the Local Boards (Dhubri, Tezpur, Nowgong and Jorhat) appreciating the increasing demand and hardship have each been entertaining three Veterinary Assistant Surgeons the rest of the Local Boards employ only two each except Sylhet and Hailakandi Local Boards which employ only one each. The Government have however strengthened the subordinate staff of the Department by according sanction for four more Veterinary Assistant Surgeons during the year under report. Since the close of the year the Government have been pleased to sanction a Special Officer (Johne's Disease Officer). The appointment of two Veterinary Graduates as Assistant Farm Managers for the Khanapara and the Sylhet Cattle Farm during the year under report should add to the efficiency of the Farms. While the expansion of the department is urged for it should be mentioned that there is just now dearth of qualified Veteri- nary Graduates who are natives of the province. Two Govern- ment stipendiaries were sent to the Bengal Veterinary College during the year under report and two more have been sent since the close of the year. It is unfortunate that few youths of this province go for this vocational education at their own expense. To keep pace with the anticipated demand more qualified Veterinary Graduates are necessary. 54. Despite handicaps the department continued to do useful work and maintained progress. Successful experimental treatment, both preventive and curative, and other useful investigation into animal diseases mark the advancement in the standard of the service done. Giving deduction for a very large
17 number of cases treated in the Nowgong district for " Mud and Water Sore " and Foot and Mouth disease following the devas- tating flood of 1934 which swelled the number of patients consi- derably last year, and having regard to the fact that half a lakh more Goat Virus Inoculations were done during the year under report over that of the last year, the number of cases treated this year should be considered as a distinct advance. It is a satisfac- tory feature that though the volume of service rendered this year excelled that of any of the previous years the expenditure has been effectively controlled to be within the reasonable limit. 55. As a step towards regeneration of the stock emascula- tion of weedy bulls was intensively carried out. As many as 25,733 animals were sterilised during the year under report against 23,232 of the last year. Attempts were made by the department to encourage the owners to preserve good local bulls by selection with the help of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons for breeding purpose. The department also advised livestock owners against other causes of degeneration of the cattle in the province which are briefly (1) Injudicious breeding, (2) Milk starvation of calves, (3) Improper feed and keep, (4) Over- stocking, (5) Owner's neglect and (6) Influence of disease and climate. 56. On account of paucity of funds and for other reasons the idea of local manufacture of the Goat Virus has been held in abeyance. The Government have, however, been pleased to accord their sanction for procuring the product from Bengal as the viability of the Muktesar Virus deteriorates by reason of long distance covered in transit. My thanks are due to Mr. P. J. Kerr, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Director, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, Bengal, for his assistance in supplying the material. 57. The Veterinary Investigation Officer, Assam, has been doing useful investigation into animal diseases. As already hinted by my predecessor Assam affords an excellent opportu- nity for such work and credit is due to the Veterinary Investiga- tion Officer for the detection of a microfilaria as the cause of a condition locally known as " Hump-Sore " in cattle. He con- tributed a valuable paper on this and another on " Acute Amphistomiasis." 58. Propaganda by the officers of the department against the nefarious design of cattle poisoning for hides and bones by interested parties has met with little success as evidenced by an increase in the crime during the year under report. In all 513 cases were reported this year against 459 of the last year.
18 59. It was a great encouragement to the officers of the department that the Hon'ble Minister of Education, Assam, paid a visit to the Government Veterinary Hospital, Laboratory and office at Gauhati during the year under report. 60. The Department has become poorer by the premature death of two of its most devoted officers, viz., Babu Girish Chan- dra Dev, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Jagannathpur and Babu Jagadish Das Gupta, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Tangla. While the loss is very much regretted I take this oppor- tunity to place on record the excellent service they rendered to the department and through it to the public all throughout their career. The Department also lost the service of Babu Guru Prasanna Sen, who after a full career proceeded on well earned pension with effect from the 1st July, 1935, from the topmost post of the department. The Government were pleased to record their appreciation of service rendered by Babu Guru Prasanna Sen in their Resolution on the last year's Annual Report. 61. I feel diffident to select names for good work when the entire staff worked so loyally and assiduously which is very much appreciated. I however feel that my report will be incom- plete if I do not mention the names of Mr. P. G. Pande, M.Sc., M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Investigation Officer, Assam, for his useful investigation into animal diseases, Babu Bhudhar Chan- dra Chatterjee, Veterinary Inspector, Gauhati Circle No. II, (since appointed Johne's Disease Officer) for his consistent all round good work, Maulavi Azizuddin Sarkar, Veterinary Inspector, Dibrugarh, for his laborious work in connection with epidemic in the Sibsagar district, Babu Hemanta Kumar Nag Chaudhuri, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, for his unabating devotion to laboratory work, and lastly both the staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeons for their help in conducting the experi- mental work. Consequent on the expansion and progr:ss of the Depart- mental activities office work has considerably increased in volume which the present staff find difficult to cope with. My Head Clerk Maulavi Muhammad Eunus tried to be useful under these limitations. I must however say that before any proposal for an increase in the ministerial staff is made in these days of financial difficulty serious attempts will be made for readjustment and any possible modification of the system of work in the office with a view to secure the desired efficiency with the present limited staff.
19 62. Thanks of the department are due to those public spirited gentlemen who took great interest in Veterinary matters and rendered active help to the department. I also acknowledge with thanks all assistance the department received from the District and Subdivisional Officers and the Chairmen, Local Boards, who showed a keen interest in matters concerning the department and general welfare of the livestock. Lastly I take this opportunity to express my thanks to Mr. F. Ware, F.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Director, Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, for the service the department received from him and his Institute, to the Director and the Deputy Director of Agriculture, Livestock, Assam, for their assistance to the department in dealing with Johne's disease in their stock both in and outside the Farms and to the President, Manipur State Durbar, for the facility and help he rendered to the department in carrying out an experiment to test the degree of susceptibility of the Manipuri cattle to Goat Virus. S. C. GHOSE, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Assam.

Read2 whereas previously a complicated five weeks' course of treatment was required, with distinctly less efficacy. The result so far obtained is full of promise and the destruction of horses under the Glanders and Farcy Act for Surra may now be looked upon as a thing of the past. The number of cases treated this year considerably in- creased, being 112,680 against 107,086 of the last year. There was an equally substantial increase in the number of castrations performed, 25,334 against 22,914 in 1934-35. The total number of Serum-alone inoculations performed was 27,415 against 25,305 last year, and to these must be added the 70,081 inocula- tions performed with Goat Vaccine against 20,396. These figures illustrate the increasing popularity of Goat Vaccine inoculation which is now thoroughly appreciated by the ryots. It of course greatly increases the work of the Department. The three Government Veterinary Hospitals in the province registered 5,862 patients against 5,544 in 1934-35. The appoint- ment of a whole-time officer for the Gauhati laboratory was also amply justified by the rise in the number of specimens examined in the year under report from 2,405 to 3,653. In the field of research and investigation, which have been actively pursued through the Special Officer appointed by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, the great problem presented to the Department has been the surprisingly high incidence of Johne's disease among farm cattle, as indicated by tests with Avian Tuberculin. The tests are not yet complete, and meantime it is not possible to evaluate with any precision the meaning of this high incidence and its necessary effect upon cattle-breeding policy in Assam, in particular the future of the farms. The matter has however been repeatedly and anxiously considered by Government, who appointed a committee in December 1935 under the chairmanship of Mr. F. Ware, F.R.C.V.S., Director, Imperial Veterinary Institute, Muktesar, to advise upon the action to be taken. All positive known eases have been with- drawn to the Khanapara and Sylhet farms in accordance with their advice, and these farms have for the time being been placed temporarily out of action so far as concerns issue of animals until they can be declared wholly or partially clear again. The loss entailed by the disposal of animals determined to be hopelessly diseased has reached serious proportions. Government appreciate the need for strengthening the Veterinary staff. They hope that the good example shown by Dhubri, Nowgong, Tezpur and Jorhat Local Boards in
3 entertaining a third Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, will eventually be followed by other Boards in the province. The subordinate staff of the Department was strengthened by accord of sanction for four more Veterinary Assistant Surgeons during the year under review in addition to the Special Officer of the Inspector class appointed since the close of the year for the test and retest of animals for Johne's disease. Two of those Veterinary gra- duates were appointed as Assistant Farm Managers of the Khanapara and the Sylhet Government Cattle Farms. It is hoped that they will add greatly to the efficiency of the Farms. Government appreciate the active co-operation received from the Livestock branch of the Department of Agriculture in the working of the Department. While Government agree with the Superintendent in his remarks that serious contagious diseases of livestock have a direct bearing on agriculture, public health, and the economic condition of the province, and while they appreciate the probable usefulness of a propaganda section in educating the masses, they regret that the present financial position does not permit anything concrete to be done. Government regret the premature death of two devoted officers of the Department in Babu Girish Chandra Dev and Babu Jagadish Das Gupta : they note the good work done by the other staff and are glad to record that the Department has considerably progressed under the present Superintendent, Rai Sahib S. C. Ghose. Besides an all round substantial increase in the volume of service rendered, successful experimental treatment, both preventive and curative, and other useful investigations into animal diseases mark the advance obtained. They also observe with satisfaction that in spite of these in- creased activities, the Department was run economically.

No. R1-1/2396. From RAI SAHIB SRISH CHANDRA GHOSE, G.B.V.C., SUPERINTENDENT, CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, ASSAM, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ASSAM EDUCATION AND LOCAL SELF- GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS, SHILLONG. Dated Gauhati, the 12th July 1937. Sir, I have the honour to submit herewith the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, for the year 1936-37. Your obedient servant, S. C. GHOSE, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Assam.
Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, for the year 1936-37 PREFACE.2 In the previous year 3,653 specimens of all kinds were exa- mined of which 56 were diagnosed as Anthrax, 32 as Hæmorrha- gic Septicæmia, 59 as Surra, 3 as Black-quarter, 1 as Fowl Cholera, 1 as Dirofilaria Immitis in a dog and 34 as Johne's dis- ease. VETERINARY INVESTIGATION OFFICER. 5. Mr. P. G. Pande, M.SC, M.R.C.V.S., continued to hold the post of the Veterinary Investigation Officer, Assam, throughout the year except for 26 days from the 23rd May, 1936, to the 6th June, 1936, and from the 23rd December 1936, to the 2nd Janu- ary, 1937, when he was on leave. He was on tour for 219 days and travelled 2,073 miles by rail and 5,952miles by road and boat. He visited 68 villages and Tea Estates, 5 Jail Dairies twice each and 5 Government Farms thrice each excluding the Khanapara Farm where several visits were made during the year in connec- tion with Johne's disease. He examined 1,027 specimens of all kinds in his laboratory and 112 specimens were sent to Muktesai for examination and confirmation. 6. The following diseases were investigated by the Veteri- nary Investigation Officer, Assam, during the year:3 he undertook during the year under report, specially on Kumri in horses particularly to ascertain if any relation the disease has with Osteoporosis4 15. Surra 5 30. Pleuro Pneumonia.6 40. Anthrax.7 VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. 44. Table V shows the work of the three Government Vete- rinary Hospitals in the province, viz., Gauhati, Silchar and Shillong. The total number of animals treated in the hospitals during the year under report including both in and out-patients was 6,094 against 5,862 of the previous year. The total number of cases supplied with medicines for treatment of animals not brought to the hospitals was 209 against 14 in the previous year. A sum of Rs. 1,102-8-0 was realised as hospital receipts against Rs. 1,217-12-0 of the previous year. This amount does not include Rs. 230-0-0 received as cost of certain special treatment. 45. Gauhati Veterinary Hospital.8 PART IV.9 The following hospitals and dispensaries were inspected by him :10 several scattered localities all over the province in connection with the Johne's disease work and carried out tests mainly in different rural areas and also in the Government Farms which however were mainly taken up by the Veterinary Investigation Officer. In this connection he made six hundred and ninety- seven tests. At headquarters he had to devote time in the Laboratory when the Laboratory Veterinary Assistant Surgeon alone could not cope with the work. (4) Maulavi Fariduddin Ahmed, Officiating Veterinary Ins- pector, held charge of the Gauhati Circle No. I from the 1st April, 1936, to the 28th February, 1937, and Lower Assam Circle from the 1st March, 1937, to the 31st March 1937. He was on tour for 141 days and travelled 1,944 miles by rail, 454 miles by steamer and 1,586 miles by road and boat. He visited and revisited 140 villages and Tea Estates in connection with the inspection of the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, investigation of diseases, enquiry into the result of inoculations, etc. He inspected the following hospital and dispensaries. The dispensaries at Nalbari and Mangaldai four times each, Gauhati, Tangla, Tezpur, Sootea, Behali, Nowgong, Misa, Marigaon thrice each and hospital at Shillong and dispensaries at Kohima, Patacharkuchi and Abhoyapuri once each. He visited Habaipur Grazing Reserve and carried out Goat Tissue Virus inoculation against Rinderpest. He visited the flood- affected places in the Nowgong district in June 1936 and orga- nised and supervised Veterinary relief work there. He attended the cattle and Agricultural Exhibition held at Gauripur and Agricultural and Industrial Mela at Kokrajhar. He inspected the animals of the Gauhati Jail Dairy, Tezpur Jail Dairy, Tezpur Mental Hospital Dairy and Nowgong Jail Dairy. He inspected the Government breeding bulls at Nalbari, Mangaldai and Palashbari. (5) Babu Annada Mohan Das, Officiating Veterinary In- spector, held charge of the Gauhati Circle No. II from the 7th June, 1936, to the 28th February, 1937 and Central Assam Circle from 1st to the 31st March 1937. He was on tour for 100 days and travelled 1,784 miles by rail, 286 miles by steamer and 1,381 miles by road and boat. He visited and revisited 68 villages in connection with the inspection of work of the Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeons, investigation of diseases, enquiry into the result of inoculation etc. He inspected the following hospi- tals and dispensaries :11 53. There were 8 Reserve Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and 2 temporary Veterinary Assistant Surgeons during the year. Their services were fully utilised in leave vacancies and in sup- plementing district Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in combating outbreaks of cattle diseases. In fact the demand of extra help was so great and constant that it was not always possible to meet it with the Reserve Officers at the disposal of this Depart- ment. This again points to the necessity of increasing the Veterinary Staff maintained by the Local Boards in this pro- vince. 54. There were two Staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeons as usual one with headquarters at Gauhati and one at Silchar. Their services were particularly utilised for special work the demand for which was great. THE SCIENTIFIC AND OTHER IMPORTANT WORK CARRIED OUT DURING THE YEAR. 55. The following scientific work of importance was dealt with by this Department during the year under report besides the ordinary professional work of routine nature :12 PART V.13 59. The department is now in a position to confirm its report of the last year that the Goat Tissue Vaccine inoculation in actual seat of epidemic of Rinderpest has now passed its experimental stage in respect of plains cattle of Assam. It is indeed a great relief to all concerned. The success of the method solves a triangular problem14 able to spot out the cause of the loss. Thanks of the depart- ment are due to the Director, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar, for his collaboration and assistance given in confirming local diagnosis. Another interesting find was a case of Piroplasmosis in elephant which has so far very rarely been reported by veterinary workers. The case was successfully treated by the department. 61. Investigation into Johne's disease in cattle was exten- sively carried out. The Government in view of the importance of the disease was pleased to appoint a special Veterinary Ins- pector (Johne's Disease Officer) during the year. His main duty was survey of the disease in the province by application of specific test. The Veterinary investigation Officer, Assam, also carried out an extensive investigation into the disease during the year as in previous years and collected data. Though the department did all that were possible under the limitation of the local conditions to prevent the spread of the disease it is extremely unfortunate that the disease crept in some cases amongst the indigenous village stock. The disease is so insidious in character that it is a problem to the department. It is how- ever gratifying that stern measures adopted according to the recommendations of the WARE COMMITTEE appeared to have lowered the incidence of the disease in two main Govern- ment Cattle Breeding Farms. It is of interest to report that for the first time in India Johne's disease has this year been detected amongst goats in the Sylhet Government Cattle Breeding Farm. It was thought necessary and important to investigate if the strain of Mycobacterium Paratuberculosis responsible for the caprine disease is the same as that of Johne's disease in cattle. Materials were therefore collected from the affected goats of the Sylhet Farm and sent to the Director, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar, who after due examination reported it to be the same and identical which suggests the possibility of transmission of the disease from cattle to goats and vice versa. 62. Success in the treatment of Equine Surra last year gave incentive to give the remedy a further trial this year. Oppor- tunity came during extensive epidemics this year and was availed of. I am glad to be able to confirm my report of the last year that the treatment is of signal value as indicated by excellent results recorded this year in a number of cases. Forced and legalised destruction of horses for Surra as an incur- able and highly infectious disease, often with the help of the Police, during the last hirty years considerably prejudiced the cause of the Department and made it extremely unpopular in
15 the estimation of the public. I repeat that destruction of horses under the Glanders and Farcy Act for Surra should be a past history. This is another mile-stone in the history of the Civil Veterinary Department. Incidentally it may be noted that the drug was also tried as a preventive against the disease in a very limited number of cases with apparent good result. 63. Incidence of Anthrax in human beings simultaneously with cattle was reported from some localities in this province. In fact two localities became veritable home for the disease and serum inoculation was of no avail to prevent frequent recru- descence of the disease. So with the consent of one of the affected tea estates vaccination with Anthrax-Spore-Vaccine was undertaken. My thanks are due to Mr. D. T. Mitchei, M.R.C.V.S., Director of Veterinary Services, Burma, an officer with considerable experience of the disease in Africa, through whose courtesy I obtained the vaccine. It is pleasing to note that the protected animals are so far resisting the disease. This method of protection against Anthrax in cattle in the face of epidemic had for the first time been introduced in Assam and was given another trial in an epidemic in a village with good result so far. It is intended to give the vaccine further trials. 64. Rabies was reported to have occurred extensively in Tinsukia Circle as though endemic. Not only animals but valuable human lives were also reported to have been involved and lost. This is a preventible disease. Such a high incidence of the disease again urges the necessity of prophylactic treatment of all canines with anti-rabic vaccine and immediate destruction of all infected dogs. 65. Glanders amongst the Civil and Military Transport ponies in Lushai Hills had been a source of considerable anxiety to the department. Repeated recrudescence of the disease there necessitated the measure of Glanders and Farcy Act being intro- duced to certain areas of the Lushai Hills district this year. This is another intercommunicable disease between man and animal. This disease, the occurrence of Anthrax simultaneously in man and cattle, high incidence of Rabies involving human and animal lives simultaneously, detection of Bovine Contagious Abortion which has a relation with the Undulant Fever (Malta Fever) in man suggest the necessity of co-operation between the Public Health and the Civil Veterinary Departments in the matter of intercommunicable diseases. 66. A less thought of yet far-reaching problem which deserves public attention is the effect of unbalanced diet to the stock. As in human being so in livestock diet lacking in certain essentials is the source of many evils. This calls nowhere for so
16 much attention as in Assam. It predisposes not only to diseases but also to unproductiveness. Cattle in Assam is the poorest of the type found in India. Its unproductiveness and proneness to diseases are equally a contrast with that of the rest of the pro- vinces in India. The remark is more specially applicable to our milch cows so that the dairy industry which has been adding to the resources and solving the poverty question of many a poor family in other provinces can but little be thought of in Assam. An investigation into the cause of decline of our stock in size, strength and efficiency seems to be a call. Without this any attempt to improve the stock merely by introduction of improved bulls may in the long run prove abortive. Our cattle wealth (if it can be so called) in Assam mainly depend on pasture for their nutrition and subsistence. An investigation into the mine- ral contents of the pasture would therefore appear to be a step in the right direction. This is thought necessary not only for the development of the dairy industry in the province and health of the livestock in general and milch cows in particular but through the milk and its products also for the health and efficiency of the human race. The evil of mineral and vitamin deficiency is now an accepted truth. 67. During the year under report activities of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, towards the improvement of the livestock deserve more than a passing notice. This is represent- ed not only by emasculation of a very large number of weedy bulls exceeding a little over twenty-eight thousand but by active co-operation in every possible direction with the Agricultural Department. Thus as many as 117 stud bulls donated by the public for improvement of the breed of cattle in Assam were secured by the officers of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam. Besides this they in course of their tour in the interior examined breeding bulls for their fitness and advised stock owners on the feed and keep and general welfare of stock. Some of them signified their active co-operation by becoming members and office bearers of the branch Livestock Association in districts and subdivisions. One of them secured a donation of Rs.1,500 for the purchase of improved bulls. I myself acted as a member of the Executive Committee of the Central Livestock Improve- ment Association, Assam. As a measure of intensive propaganda for livestock improvement two mauzas in Sibsagar district were taken up where the local Veterinary Assistant Surgeons supple- mented by the specially deputed staff from headquarters carried out extensively the bloodless method of sterilisation of weedy bulls under close supervision of the Veterinary Inspector, Upper Assam Circle. They also simultaneously protected all available
17 stock there against rinderpest with Goat-Tissue Vaccine. This course was adopted prior to the introduction of improved stud bulls so generously donated by Rai Bahadur Siva Prosad Baruah who for some years past had been stipulating a scheme in colla- boration with my Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at Jorhat. The department is indebted to the Rai Bahadur, to the Deputy Com- missioner, Sibsager, Rai Bahadur Heramba Prosad Baruah, B.L., M.L.C., Chairman, Local Board, Jorhat, Khan Bahadur Maulavi Keramat Ali, B.L., M.L.A. and to Srijut Nil Moni Phukan for their active co-operation and assistance in carrying out the programme. While the good work of the subordinate staff of the department in this direction is appreciated it should be brought to the notice of the Government that difficulties of devoting attention to this useful work by the members of this department have on more than one occasion been brought home by reasons of paucity of officers and undue pressure of tremend- ous routine professional work the very limited veterinary staff have to do in response to ever-increasing and overwhelming public demand of service. 68. By way of propaganda the department availed of every opportunity to open a veterinary stall in the Exhibition in different centres of the province. In such gatherings charts and specimens of public interest were exhibited and demonstrated to the mass to educate them on the value of prevention and timely treatment of diseases. Simultaneously with this lectures were given on the feed and keep of the stock, improvement of breed, economic value of cattle, etc. I repeat my remarks of the last year on the necessity and usefulness of a propaganda officer which is keenly felt. 69. It is gratifying to record here that the public apprecia- tion of veterinary service is daily gaining ground in this province. This is indeed a very healthy sign. Public enthusiasm for more Veterinary Institutions was not only confined in passing resolu- tions for increasing the number of such Institutions but it had condensed to proposal of voluntary gift of land and houses for the purpose. Nothing could be a better and surer proof of appreciation of Veterinary Service rendered in the province. 70. As reported last year field for investigation into animal diseases is really very great in Assam. I am glad to be able to report that the Veterinary Investigation Officer has been fully utilising the scope offered by the province and I record my appreciation for the good service he has been rendering. In fact the Veterinary Investigation Officer had so far mostly done the spade work and much of the useful investigation committed to
18 his care remains ahead. To maintain a link between the Centre and Provinces in the matter of investigation of interesting and valuable animal diseases no other better scheme than the existing one (which is financed by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research) can be thought of The present term of office of the Veterinary Investigation Officer expires a few months hence. Needless to say that if the money spent during the last four years and the experience of the work the province gained by the Veterinary Investigation Officer have to be utilised for the practical benefit of the province (and through the pro- vince to the Centre) the scheme has to be extended. 71. Gauhati Veterinary Laboratory had in its credit a record of another year of useful work. In all three thousand, two hundred and fifty-one specimens were examined this year. In fact nature and number of specimens were at times of such character that the Officer in charge of the Laboratory had to be supplemented by another officer. I take this opportunity of expressing my indebtedness to the Director, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar, for the assistance he had rendered me through his various departments whenever required. 72. Two Government stipendiaries were sent to the Bengal Veterinary College during the year. This raised the number of Government stipendiaries in the College to 4. No private student from the province except a Muslim who is hot a native of the province is reported to have joined the College. While unemployment of qualified graduates some years back might have been a discouraging factor to private students for the voca- tional education in this branch it should be pointed out that the department during the last two years absorbed all the unemploy- ed graduates and is now finding difficulty to recruit qualified native of the province on account of dearth of such candidates. 73. The Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, never requir- ed so much attention for a reorganisation of its cadre as it is to-day. The demand for aid has long back far exceeded the capacity of the present staff maintained by the department. In fact call for veterinary aid has reached such a high pitch that the department is no more capable of bearing the burden of it without a substantial addition to its present staff. Recent advances made by the department and increased activity in all directions fully justify the revival of the post of the Deputy Superintendent to relieve the Superintendent of a considerable part of his routine work. In fact such an unusual pressure of work has been brought upon the Administrative Head of the Department, who has to look singlehanded from A to Z of the department, that consistent with efficiency it is no longer feasible for him to discharge his responsibility with any degree of satis- faction unless relief is given to him.
19 74. The entire staff of the department worked so zealously and unsparingly that I find it difficult to pick up names for good work. My Veterinary Investigation Officer, Johne's Disease Officer and all the Veterinary Inspectors devoted best of their attention, energy and time for furtherence of the cause for which they were employed. To my Veterinary Assistant Sur- geons, who form the backbone of the department, I have nothing but my praise for their untiring energy and devotion to duty. At times they had most difficult hours and they rose equal to the occasion. I take this opportunity of recording my high appreciation for the loyal and good service the rank and file rendered during the year. I however regret to miss Mr. K. Angami from the department who served long years as a Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeon but had to retire prematurely by reason of ill health during the year. What is true of the technical staff of the department the same holds good for the clerks of my office. On account of expansion of many sided activities of the department office work has immensely increased so that the present strength of the clerical staff proved to be inadequate. My Head Clerk, Maulavi Muhammad Eunus inspite of his care and attention found it extremely difficult to discharge his responsibility efficiently with the insufficient staff at his disposal so that it has reached a stage when reorganisation of the ministerial service of the department is also a call. 75. Before I close my report I like to take this opportunity of recording my thanks to those public spirited gentlemen who encouraged my officers and extended assistance to them and to the department, to the District and Subdivisional Officers and Chairmen, Local Boards, for their continued and constant inte- rest in all veterinary matters. I am indebted to Sir Arthur Olver, Kt., C.B., O.B.E., F.R.C.V.S., Animal Husbandry Expert, Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, Messrs. F. Ware, C.I.E., F.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Director, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar, P. J. Kerr, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., and D.T. Mitchel, M.R.C.V.S., Directors of Veterinary Services, Bengal and Burma respectively for their continued co-operation and active assistance given to me. I also acknowledge with thanks the assistance which the Director and Deputy Director (Livestock) of Agriculture, Assam, gave me and my staff in carrying out the programme of veterinary work in their farms.

GOVERNMENT OF ASSAM. Orders by the Governor. RESOLUTION ON THE VETERINARY REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1936-37. Extract from the proceedings of the Government of Assam in the Education Depart- ment, No. 2788-E., dated the 15th November 1937. READ2 3. The Veterinary Department worked during the year in close co-operation with the Livestock Section of the Agricultural Department for the all important purpose of the improvement of livestock in the province. Over 28,000 weedy bulls were castrated during the year and the officers of the Department took a lively interest in the work of the Assam Livestock Associa- tion. The success or failure of the scheme for improving live- stock in Assam depends mainly on the Veterinary and Livestock Departments working in the closest co-operation and Govern- ment attach the very greatest importance to securing this result. 4. The total number of cases treated during the year (ex- cluding castrations) was 1,20,610 against 1,12,680 in the prece- ding year and the number of castrations rose from 25,334 to 28,229. The report mentions that the volume of work per- formed is a record in the history of the Department and that the staff is no longer adequate to cope with it. Government appre- ciate the need for increasing the staff and a scheme for reorga- nization of the Department is now under their consideration. 5. The report shows that the Department has done another year of satisfactory work and that its services to the public are being appreciated. The thanks of Government are due to Rai Sahib Srish Chandra Ghose for his efficient management of the Department during the year and for his interesting report.

No. R1-1/2983 FROM RAI SAHIB SRISH CHANDRA GHOSE, G.B.V.C, P.G. (Muktesar), SUPERINTENDENT, CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, ASSAM, To THE DEPUTY SECRETARY TO THE GOVERN- MENT OF ASSAM, EDUCATION AND LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS, SHILLONG. Dated Gauhati, the 25th July 1938. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Annual Adminis- tration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, for the year 1937-38. Your obedient servant, S. C. GHOSE, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Assam.
Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, for the year 1937-38 PREFACE2 In the previous year 3,251 specimens were examined out of which 64 proved to be Anthrax, 29 Hæmorrhagic Septicaemia, 76 Surra, 3 Black Quarter and 47 Johne's disease. VETERINARY INVESTIGATION OFFICER 5. Mr. P. G. Pande, M.SC, M.R.C.V.S., held the post of the Veterinary Investigation Officer, Assam, throughout the year except for one month from the 15th June 1937 to the 14th July 1937 when he was on leave and no substitute was appointed. He was on tour for 148 days and travelled 5,588 miles by road, 3,132 miles by rail, 142 miles by boat. He visited 43 villages, 5.2 Tea Estates and 3 Government Farms in connection with his investigation work. In all he examined 594 specimens in his laboratory. He sent 98 specimens to the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute for examination and confirmation. He was on deputation for a short course of training at the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar, from the 25th September 1937 to the 25th October 1937. 6. He investigated into the following diseases during the year:3 7. A detailed report on the work of the Veterinary Investiga- tion Officer, Assam, for the year 1937-38 has already been submitted to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research through the Local Government. 8. The term of the post of the Veterinary Investigation Officer has been extended for one year and it is proposed that he should continue further investigation during the next year on the line of the programme made out for the year. VETERINARY INSTRUCTION 9. During the year there were six Assam Government stipen- diaries in the Bengal Veterinary College, Calcutta, distributed as follows:4 14. Surra.5 OTHER ANIMALS (SHEEP, GOATS, DOGS) 27. Anthrax.6 alone" method and the rest by the Goat Tissue Vaccine method. The number of deaths amongst the inoculated animals was reported to be 1,117. In the previous year inoculations were performed in 649 outbreaks in 9 districts in which 13,632 ani- mals were reported to have died before inoculation ; 1,14,608 animals were inoculated out of which 1,377 animals were report- ed to have died. 38. Anthrax.7 ITINERANT VETERINARY ASSISTANT SURGEONS' WORK 42. Table IV shows the work done by the Itinerating Veterinary Assistant Surgeons as well as by the Staff and Reserve Veterinary Assistant Surgeons while working in the districts. In all they visited 14,694 villages, performed 28,717 castrations and treated 53,694 animals for contagious diseases and 85,924 ani- mals for non-contagious diseases. In the previous year 13,134 villages were visited, 28,229 castrations were performed, 25,850 animals were treated for contagious diseases and 94,760 for non- contagious diseases. The extensive epidemics of cattle disease caused the number of cases treated for contagious diseases to swell to more than double the number of animals treated for contagious diseases last year. For the very same reason there had been a small fall in the number of animals treated for non-contagious diseases. It should be stated here that the demand for service in connec- tion with epidemics had been so heavy that during the year under report seven dispensaries had to be kept temporarily closed for short periods as the Reserve Veterinary Assistant Sur- geons were occupied in epidemic duties. This factor also contri- buted to the small fall in the number of animals treated for non- contagious diseases and a heavy increase in the number of ani- mals treated for contagious diseases. VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES 43. Table V shows the work of the three Government Veterinary Hospitals in the province, viz., Gauhati, Silchar and Shillong. The total number of animals treated in these hospi- tals during the year under report including both in and out- patients was 6,552 against 6,094 of the previous year and the total number of castrations was 558 against 499 of the previous year. The total number of cases supplied with medicines for treatment of animals which were not presented in the hospital was 592 against z09 of the previous year. Hospital receipts amounted to a total of Rs. 1,075 against Rs. 1,102 of the previous year. 44. Gauhati Veterinary Hospital.8 45. Silchar Veterinary Hospital.9 rail, 56 miles by steamer and 1,884 miles by road. He tested and retested for Johne's disease the cattle of the Government Cattle Farms at Sylhet, Khanapara and Jorhat and also tested those of the Titabar Agricultural Farm, Jorhat Jail dairy, Tezpur Mental Hospital dairy and the Gauripur Rajbati. In all he made 616 tests. He also inspected the animals of the Gauripur Goshala, Dibrugarh Goshala and those of the Gauhati and Tezpur Jail dairies. He examined the Government elephants stationed at Goalpara, Gauhati, Mangaldai and Nowgong. He investigated and organised the work in connection with a severe and wide-spread epidemic of Rinderpest in the Goal- para subdivision. He also demonstrated "Serum alone" method of inoculation against Rinderpest to the Assistant Medical Officers of Tea Estates at Dibrugarh, Doom Doom, Tinsukia, Majbat, Chhatapukuri (Sootea) and North Lakhimpur. He delivered a lecture on veterinary work and its value and impor- tance to the Inspectors of the Co-operative Societies in their Training class at Gauhati. At headquarters he supervised laboratory and serum depot work and assisted and gave me some relief in my work at headquarters. (2) Babu Hem Chandra Sen, Veterinary Inspector, held charge of the Surma Valley Circle during the year except for the period from the 13th December 1937 to the 31st March 1938 when he was on leave and Maulavi Saved Ataul Haque officiated. He was on tour for 85 days, travelled 1,303 miles by rail, 189 miles by steamer, 763 miles by road and 327 miles by boat. He visited and revisited 127 villages and Tea Estates in connection with the inspection of the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, investigation of diseases, enquiry into results of vacci- nation and inoculation. The following hospital and dispensaries were inspected by him during the year:10 He delivered a lecture in the Training class of the Co- operative Inspectors at Sylhet with a view to give them an idea on veterinary work so that they might take up rural reconstruc- tion work in close harmony with local officers of this Depart- ment. (3) Maulavi Azizuddin Sarkar, Veterinary Inspector, held charge of the Upper Assam Circle throughout the year. He was on tour for 176 days and travelled 1,250 miles by rail and 3,672 miles by road and boat. He visited and revisited 294 villages and Tea Estates in connection with the inspection of the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, supervision and organisation of epidemic work and enquiry into results of vacci- nation and inoculation. He inspected the dispensaries at Sibsagar, Nazira, Jorhat, Majuli, Mariani, Golaghat, Badlipar, Tinsukia and North Lakhimpur four times each, Dibrugarh three times and Sadiya and Dhakuakhana once each. He inspected the stud bulls stationed at Sibsagar, Golaghat and North Lakhimpur and the Government elephants at Golaghat and North Lakhimpur. He visited the Jorhat Farm and the Jorhat Jail dairy in connection with epidemic diseases amongst cattle. He also attended the Agricultural, Industrial and Educational exhibition at North Lakhimpur and organised lectures and demonstrations and dis- tribution of Veterinary leaflets with a view to educate the mass on the value of cattle and its welfare. (4) Maulavi Fariduddin Ahmed, Officiating Veterinary Inspector, held charge of the Lower Assam Circle throughout the year. He was on tour for 171 days and travelled 3,202 miles by rail, 28 miles by steamer and 2,186 miles by road and boat. He visited and revisited 202 villages and Tea Estates in connection with the inspection of the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, investigation of epidemic diseases and enquiry into the results of inoculation and vaccination. He inspected the dispensaries at Nalbari five times, Dhubri, Bilashipara, Abhoyapuri, Barpeta, Patacharkuchi, Mangaldai and Tangla four times each, Sukchar three times and Tura once. He also inspected the Government breeding bulls at Dhubri, Nalbari, Kamarkuchi and Kotpowha. He also visited several cattle pounds in his circle. He attended the agricultural and Industrial Exhibition held at Tura and the cattle fair at Gauripur and organised lectures and demonstration of patholo- gical and other specimens of value and interest to the masses to educate them on the general welfare of cattle.
11 (5) Babu Annada Mohan Das, Veterinary Inspector, held charge of the Central Assam Circle throughout the year. He was on tour for 176 days and visited and revisited 143 villages and travelled 3,202 miles by rail, 2,186 miles by road and boat and 28 miles by steamer in connection with the inspection of the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, investigation into epidemics of cattle diseases and enquiry into results of inocula- tion and vaccination. He inspected the Gauhati Hospital and the dispensaries at Goalpara, Polashbari, Tezpur, Sootea and Behali four times each, the Shillong Hospital and the dispensaries at Nowgong and Misa three times each and the dispensary at Marigaon twice. He also conducted the sero-virus method of inoculation amongst certain buffaloes of high susceptibility. (6) Maulavi Syed Ataul Haque officiated as a Veterinary Inspector and held charge of the Surma Valley Circle from the 13th December 1937 to the 31st March 1938. During this period he was on tour for 68 days and travelled 721 miles by rail and 726 miles by road and visited and revisited 27 villages in connection with the inspection of the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and investigation and organisation of epide- mic work. He inspected the Silchar Hospital and the dispensaries at Silchar, Palonghat, Karimganj, Patharkandi, Kulaura, Maulvi- bazar, Shaistaganj, Habiganj, Sunamganj, Sylhet and also the Sylhet Local Board dispensary once each; the Jagannathpur dispensary and the work of the Stationary Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Sylhet Farm, were inspected by him twice. He also visited the Sylhet Cattle Farm and the Karimganj Farm once each. 51. As in the last year also 8 Reserve Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and 2 temporary Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were employed during the year and their services were fully utilised in leave vacancies and in supplementing the district staff in con- trolling epidemic of cattle disease. The demand for extra assistance has been ever on the increase and during this year also the demand was much more than it was possible to meet with this staff. 52. Two Staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were employed as in the previous year, one with headquarters at Gauhati and one at Silchar. Their services were utilised for special work for
12 which also the demand was great. The demand for extra help from different Local Boards and from the public in the province was so great that both the Staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeons had to be deputed in addition to Reserve Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and Temporary Veterinary Assistant Sur- geons to supplement the district staff in controlling epidemics of cattle disease. SCIENTIFIC AND OTHER IMPORTANT WORK 53. In addition to normal routine work the Department conducted scientific work of importance during the year on the same line as was reported last year. Besides investigation and research were also made on the following diseases :13 PART VI.14 59. Goat Tissue Vaccine method of protection against Rinderpest has gained considerable ground so that it is now solely used for plains cattle of Assam. During the year under report in all 125,191 cattle were protected by this method as opposed to 111,895 of the preceding year. Mortality amongst the vaccinated was negligible 0.88 per cent. As a matter of fact the success of the operation is so very striking that it may be said that half the battle to control the deadliest cattle Plague (Rinderpest) is won. Experiments were carried out on the protective value of the product and degree of reaction in buffa- loes in Assam during the year under report. It remains yet an undecided factor as to the use of the product in buffaloes in view of very severe reaction attended with deaths observed in some breed of buffaloes. Attempts are now being made to use the product in a modified dose with a controlling dose of ordina- ry anti-rinderpest serum used simultaneously in case of highly susceptible buffaloes. The degree of susceptibility to the Goat Tissue Vaccine of hill cattle in Assam is another matter which deserves attention but little so far could be done in this direction for want of time, staff and opportunity. 60. The incidence of the Johne's disease has been lowered in the Government Farms under the strict measures adopted under the Ware Committee recommendations. The situation in the rural areas cannot possibly be controlled with the same degree of efficiency for obvious reasons. It is apprehended that the disease has come to stay in the province and would continue to be a menace to cattle population in the same way as Tuber- culosis to human beings. The redeeming feature in this connec- tion is that the experiment with extra mineral feed given to Farm cattle is suggestive of providing at least some resistance against the disease. 61. The cause of deteriorated stock in Assam was dealt with in my general remarks contained in paragraph 66 of the annual report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, for the year 1936-37. As a matter of fact diet deficient in certain essentials not only stunts normal growth but acts as a predisposing factor to many pathological conditions. In this connection it is of interest to note that Dr. N. C. Wright, M.A., D.SC., Ph.D., Director of Henna Dairy Research Insti- tute, Scotland, who specially came out to India at the instance of the Government of India, after due investigation laid particular stress on the question. I repeat therefore that it seems to be a call to have local investigation into the soil and fodder deficiency in the province which is supposed to be at least one of the causes
15 for the deteriorated condition of cattle in the province. Pletho- ra of Endoparasitic infestation, occurrence of Kumri in horses, higher incidence of Johne's disease in Assam, Abortion in cattle, Sterility all might be traced to be predisposed by deficiency of some essentials in food contents. 62. Tuberculosis was detected in an imported Rhodes Island hen belonging to the poultry section of the Government Cattle Farm, Jorhat. Stern measure was immediately taken to stamp out the disease which for the first time was detected in Assam. The control of Avian Tuberculosis is more difficult in the sense that the infection may spread through the infected eggs. It is indeed sad, if not a misfortune, that attempts to improve the breed of cattle and fowls in the province by impor- tation of new blood have found a set back due to importation of such dangerous pathological conditions as Johne's disease in cattle and Tuberculosis in fowls. 63. Slow breeding and sterility were reported in some cases of Farm animals. When remedial measures such as Pro- lan and Hormone treatment are indicated it shall have to be remembered that sterility might be the outcome of some infec- tious diseases, e.g., Brucellosis or Tuberculosis. It is a matter for investigation if Johne's disease which is caused by an orga- nism which has phylogenic relation with Mycobacterium Tuber- culosis plays any part in bringing out the condition. 64. Cattle-poisoning, specially under the cover of epidemics, is another menace which requires very rigid handling. There are instances on record when this nefarious design was respon- sible for heavy loss to ryots. If the object with which the cattle are poisoned by the designing and interested people, viz., the collection of hides and bones, could be controlled the vice might be effectively checked. This is a question which deserves very serious notice not only from the humanitarian point of view but also for economic reasons. 65. A very valuable herd of a Shillong Dairy was affected with grave pathological condition attended with mortality which was supposed to be due to ingestion of some poisonous plant. Investigation led to suspect "Lantana" as responsible for the condition. As similar pathological condition was also noticed amongst cattle in certain plains area of the province a specimen of this plant was sent to the Curator, Indian Section, Indian Museum, for identification and report on its properties. It has since been identified as Lantana Camara Linn by the Superintendent, Royal Botanical Gardens, Sibpur, Bengal. It has further been stated that the seeds, flowers and leaves of the plant are known to be poisonous to cattle in North West India,
16 66. Apathy of stock-owners to proper feed and keep of cattle is so great in Assam that it seems to be an insurmountable problem to deal with. However with a view to demonstrate how practically at no cost and with a little labour fodder can be grown a demonstration plot of Guinea Grass is maintained in the Gauhati Veterinary Hospital compound which after feeding the in-patients yielded a small revenue. A similar demon- stration plot is proposed to be started in the Veterinary Hospital compound in Silchar with the object of educating the public on the necessity of growing fodder. 67. Past experience signifies that until and unless some effective legislative measures are adopted to check the unrestrict- ed movement of cattle at the time of epidemics of cattle disease it will continue to be a very difficult task for all the time to come to control epidemic diseases. Spread of the disease from place to place, nay even from district to district and valley to val- ley could be traced to unrestricted cattle traffic and cattle market to the great loss of the ryots. Compulsory vaccination of cattle against Rinderpest is another matter which deserves considera- tion, specially this is so in any centre where this fell disease breaks out. 68. Total mortality of livestock was greater this year as compared with the previous year. To be precise the mortality was more accurately recorded than in the previous year. What an economic loss it is to the province needs hardly be empha- sised. The saddest part of the situation is that poor ryots who constitute the great majority of the cattle owners sustained the loss almost in its entirety. When the economic uplift appears to be the watch word in every lip such a heavy drainage of ryots' only capital17 parts of the province, secured donation to the extent of Rs. 1,974 and collected subscription of Rs. 1,788 besides securing 430 members for the Branch Associations. This is apart from 29,275 castrations performed by the veterinary staff in connection with the improvement of the stock in the province. I myself served as a member of the Executive Committee of the Central Livestock Improvement Association, Assam. 70. The present system of dual control of the district Veterinary Assistant Surgeons by the Department and the Local Boards has not been working satisfactorily. To serve two mas- ters is to serve none. Difficulties experienced by reason of division of control over the district Veterinary Assistant Surgeons need hardly be emphasised. The public at large thinks that in all matters concerning Veterinary the entire responsibility lies with the Civil Veterinary Department whereas the district Veterinary Assistant Surgeons all over the province mostly are under the direct control and management of the Local Boards. Responsibility without power of control is fundamentally un- sound. No wonder therefore that the Department finds itself in an awkward and unhappy position for no fault of its own and has to court unmerited stigma. The earlier the present dual system of control is ended the better for all concerned. 71. An appeal was made to all the Local Boards impressing upon them the necessity of strengthening their veterinary staff commensurate with the demand for aid. It is to be regretted that though the Local Boards expressed appreciating the neces- sity of increasing the number of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons maintained by them nothing so far materialised except in the case of Dibrugarh Local Board who have temporarily entertained a third Veterinary Assistant Surgeon and the North Sylhet Local Board who have revived the post of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon under them which was held in abeyance. While I congratulate the Chairmen, Local Boards, Dibrugarh and North Sylhet, I take this opportunity of appealing again to the rest of the Local Boards to give their serious thoughts on this urgent and overdue measure. I am also glad to be able to report that the Chairman, Local Board, Jorhat, who already entertains three Veterinary Assistant Surgeons has been contemplating to start a fourth Veterinary Dispensary under his board. The Government have been pleased to accord their sanction to strengthen the number of Reserve Veterinary Assistant Surgeons by two more officers on permanent basis since the close of the year under report.
18 72 Lectures were delivered to the Inspectors of the Go- operative Societies in two centres of Gauhati and Sylhet with a view to secure greater co-ordination between the departments in rural reconstruction work. My thanks are due to Mr. S. L. Mehta, i.c.s., Registrar, Co-operative Societies, who took the initiative in the matter and rendered all help. 73. The entire subordinate staff showed once more loyal devotion to duty. But for their zeal, enthusiasm and assiduous application to duty such a voluminous service with the limited staff at the disposal of the Department would have been impos- sible. The Circle Veterinary Inspectors in general and the Johne's Disease Officer in particular did their parts well. I take this opportunity of recording my appreciation for the excellent work the entire staff did during the year. The Department has become poorer by the well-earned retirement from service of Maulavi Azizuddin Sarkar, Veterinary Inspector, Upper Assam Circle, with the close of the year under report. In him the Department had a zealous and enthusiastic worker, whose ab- sence, I confidently believe, would be keenly felt by all con- cerned. 74. The Office under the guidance of my Head Clerk, Maulavi Muhammad Funus continued to work under handicap. The volume of work to be done had been disproportionately greater than the staff entertained. As all attempts to manage the work by redistribution failed with the existing ministerial staff a proposal to strengthen the staff is now awaiting considera- tion and sanction of the Government. 75. Thanks of the Department are due to those who took an active interest and helped me and my staff in the execution of the work in the districts. I also take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the District and Subdivisional Officers and the Chairmen of Local Boards for all assistance they have extended to the Department. I am indebted to the Director of the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar, for the help he has rendered me through the various Departments of his Institute and to Mr. P. J. Kerr, m.r.c.v.s., i.v.s., Director of Veterinary Services, Bengal, for his continued co-operation. My thanks are also due to the Director of Agriculture, Assam, for the assistance he has rendered me and my staff in carrying out veterinary work in the Government Farms under his control. S. GHOSE, Supdt., Civil Veterinary Deptt., Assam.

With a view to allay discontent in the tea gardens for insufficient veterinary aid during epidemics, Government have approved a scheme under which 115 Assistant Medical Officers of the tea estates were trained during the year in the method of preventive inoculation of cattle against Rinderpest. The arrangement cannot be regarded as satisfactory but Government hope that with the co-operation which the Tea Industry has kindly extended the scheme will go a great way in solving the difficulty of inadequacy of staff under epidemic conditions. As in the previous year, the officers of the Department worked in close co-operation with the livestock section of the Agriculture Department and an increasing number of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons worked as Branch Secretaries and Agents and inspected breeding bulls, secured donations and realised sub- scriptions for the Branch Associations in addition to performing a larger number of castrations of weedy bulls. By adopting strict measures it has been possible to lower the incidence of Johne's disease in the farm cattle. In the periodical test held last cold weather, only 3 positive and 2 doubt- ful reactors were found in the whole herd of 155 animals in the Khanapara Farm. Government have therefore ordered issue from the farm of animals which have been consistently negative to the Avian Tuberculin test. The situation in the rural areas was, however, not equally satisfactory and the Johne's disease officer continued to hold periodical tests with a view to control the disease. The Superintendent refers in his report to the faulty system of dual control of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons by the Department and the Local Boards. Government recognise the difficulties arising from divided responsibility and dual control and have decided to put the matter before the ensuing Local Bodies' Conference for expression of their views. There has been an all-round increase in the volume of work performed by the staff during the year under report, and Govern- ment realise that the strain on the existing inadequate staff has been very great indeed. They can only hope that following the good examples of Dibrugarh, North Sylhet and Jorhat Local Boards, all other Local Boards will increase the number of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons according to their necessity and that funds will be available in spite of financial stringency.
3 Government have noticed with satisfaction the very sub- stantial increase in the volume of service rendered to the public by the staff and their thanks are due to Rai Sahib Srish Chandra Ghosh for his very efficient and economical administration of the department in spite of insufficient staff and also for his interesting report.

(Muktesar), DIRECTOR OF VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, ASSAM, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ASSAM, EDUCATION AND LOCAL SELF- GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS, SHILLONG. Dated Gauhati, the 20th July 1939. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Annual Adminis- tration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, for the year 1938-39. Your obedient servant, S: C. GHOSE, Directors of Veterinary Department, Assam.
Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, for the year 1938-39 PREFACE.2 Surra, 6 proved Johne's disease and 3 proved Black Quarter. These are excluding the specimens examined by the Veterinary Investigation Officer, Assam, In the previous year 2,929 specimens of various kinds were examined of which 74 proved to be Anthrax, 39 Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, 21 Surra, 12 Johne's disease, 4 Black Quarter and 1 Avian Tuberculosis. VETERINARY INVESTIGATION OFFICER 5. Mr. P. G. Pande, m.sc, m.r.c.v.s., held the post of the Veterinary Investigation Officer, Assam, from the 1st April 1938 up to the 4th January 1939 when he was transferred to the United Provinces as Veterinary Investigation Officer there. During the period he was Veterinary Investigation Officer, Assam, he was on leave on average pay for 12 days from the 16th September 1.938 to the 27th September 1938. Mr. Bhudhar Chandra Chatterjee who was temporarily appointed as Veteri- nary Investigation Officer, Assam, held charge from the 5th January 1939 to the end of the year, but owing to his ill health he was on leave from the 17th February 1939 up to the end of the year. Mr. P. G. Pande was on tour for 90 days, travelled 2,054 miles by rail and 1,215 miles by road. He visited 29 villages, 7 Tea Estates and one Farm in connection with investigation of animal diseases. He summed up his experience on the incidence and epizoo- tology of Johne's disease in a paper and submitted the same to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. 6. Amongst others the following diseases were investigated by Mr. P. G. Pande during the year:3 VETERINARY INSTRUCTIONS 8. During the year there were six Assam Government stipendiaries in the Bengal Veterinary College, Calcutta, distri- buted as follows :4 16. Other diseases.5 28. Pleuro Pneumonia.6 327 were done by the serum alone method and the rest by the Goat Tissue Vaccine and amongst the inoculated 1,117 died subsequently. 37. Anthrax.7 districts. In all 15,054 villages were visited by them in which they castrated 30,758 animals and treated 29,001 animals for contagious diseases and 1,15,431 for non-contagious diseases. In the previous year 14,694 villages were visited in which 28,717 castrations were performed and 53,694 animals were treated for contagious diseases and 85,924 for non-contagious diseases. During the previous year owing to extensive epidemics of Foot-and-mouth disease the number of cases treated for contagious diseases swelled up to more than double the number of the year previous to that. Even in spite of this the total number of cases treated for contagious and non-contagious diseases together shows a substantial increase this year over that of the last year. VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES 42. Table V shows the. work of the three Government Vete- rinary Hospitals in the province, viz., Gauhati, Silchar and Shillong. The total number of animals treated in these Hospi- tals during the year under report including both in-and-out- patients was 7,844 against 6,552 in the previous year, and the total number of castrations performed during the year was 542 against 558 in the previous year. It seems that the owners are gradually realising the value of presenting sick animals to the Dispensary and Hospital so that the number of cases for which medicines were supplied but not brought to hospitals was very meagre this year (14 against 592 of the previous year) Total hospital receipts amounted to Rs. 1,066 against Rs. 1,075 in the previous year. 43. Gauhati Veterinary Hospital.8 PART III.9 Anthrax Spore Vaccine in cattle. He also investigated into an outbreak of suspected Surra amongst the transport animals at Kohima and also investigated into the result of treatment of Surra cases in Kamrup. During extensive epidemics of Rinderpest the Johne's Disease Officer had to be withdrawn from his specific duties and was deputed as a special case to investigate and organise Rin- derpest epidemic work in the Kamrup district. He was also entrusted to give demonstration of Anti-Rinderpest Serum inocu- lation to 86 Assistant Medical Officers of Tea Estates in six different centres in the province. While at headquarters the Johne's Disease Officer also supervised work in the Laboratory and in the Serum Depot. (2) Babu Hem Chandra Sen, Veterinary Inspector, held charge of the Surma Valley Circle throughout the year except for the period from the 1st to the 18th April 1938 when he was on leave and Maulavi Syed Ataul Haque officiated in his place. He was on tour for 166 days and visited 166 villages and Tea Estates ; he travelled 2,308 miles by rail, 82 miles by steamer, 1,178 miles by road and 256 miles by boat. He inspected the following hospitals and dispensaries:10 He inspected the Veterinary dispensaries in his charge as follows11 SCIENTIFIC AND OTHER IMPORTANT WORK 50. The Department continued its usual normal activities. Besides research and investigation were done on the following pathological conditions amongst other things : (1) Kumri in horses. (2) A disease in buffaloes simulating Kumri clinically. (3) Effect of Anthrax Spore Vaccine in the face of Anthrax epidemic. (4) Non-specific prophylactic treatment of Surra in horses. (5) Investigation into Bovine Pleuro-Pneumonia. (6) An obscure pathological condition in cattle alleged to be due to ingestion of grass parasitised with fungus of Balancia Species. PART V.12 Notwithstanding the fact that Foot-and-Mouth disease, which caused the number of cases to swell up last year considera- bly, was conspicuously of minor occurrence this year, there is yet an increase in the total number of cases treated. Similarly there is an increase in the number of animals castrated. But the most outstanding feature is the increase in the volume of preventive vaccinations against Rinderpest which had surpassed all. To control Rinderpest, which alone is responsible for more than half of the total mortality of cattle in Assam and which year after year puts a heavy toll upon cattle population of the province, is the most sacred duty of the Department. With that object in view and having regard to extensive virulent epidemics which were prevailing the Department concern rated its attention to the most effective yet incredibly cheap system of vaccination against the disease. It has very good reasons to feel gratified that its earnest efforts succeeded in efficiently protecting more than double the number it did last year and much greater than that of any of the previous years. Thus the total number of cattle which had been protected against the disease this year with the Goat Tissue Vaccine rose to 276,814 against 125,521 of the last year, 111,859 in the year 1936-37, 70,081 in 1935-36, 20,396 in 1934-35 and 2,773 in 1933-34. This at once suggests to what extent this measure of the preven- tive vaccination has become popular with ryots. It is indeed gratifying that the number of vaccination which stood at only 2,273 in 1933-34 has gone up as high as 276,814 during the year under report. 54. While I report this rapid expansion of veterinary work in the province I am not slow to realise that it would have been an impossible task to attain this but for the selfless, strenuous and ungrudging service rendered by the earnest band of the loyal subordinate officers placed at my disposal. The facilities and active co-operation rendered by the ryots were also no less responsible for the substantial progress in work. While efficien- cy and usefulness of service rendered are mainly responsible for the success, intimate mixing of the staff with the ryots to make them feel that the Department shares with them their pains and sorrows and therefore stands by them at their needs contributed immensely. What a tremendous task it had been to educate the masses against their superstitious faith will be realised when I say that in the past they not only stoutly resisted vaccination of cattle lest they offend the Goddess of the disease (" Aye " or " Sitala " as they call it) but many used to go up to the length of suppressing the information of epidemics. Active propaganda, efficient service, practical demonstration of the value of the preventive and curative treatment, and close touch
13 and active co-operation with the ryots have been able to earn their confidence and dispel the superstitious faith so that owners who would once suppress the report of epidemics now send requisition for veterinary aid even by wire. This is not only true of the people of advanced rural areas but the usefulness of the Department has penetrated far deep into the interior so that the most orthodox and backward tribal people also send now telegraphic requisitions for veterinary aid. 55. Rinderpest had never been so bad as it was this year particularly in Sylhet, Kamrup, Goalpara, Nowgong and Darrang districts which had been the worst sufferers. The situation was indeed so seriously alarming that it confronted the Department. It necessitated not only mobilising all the reserve force of the Department but permanent district staff had to be withdrawn, even temporarily closing some of the dispensaries against the wishes and incurring displeasure of the local authori- ty in cases, with a view to control the epidemics. This explains higher mortality of cattle this year. The situation was indeed so pressing that the Government sanctioned extra staff which however could not be availed of on account of paucity of quali- fied Veterinary Graduates. In this connection I like to refer to paragraph 67 of my annual report for 1937-38 and I cannot help but bring it once more to the notice of the Government that unrestricted movement of cattle had again been responsible for the spread of the disease which is always a handicap in effectively controlling epidemics. I should like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to Mr. K. Cantlie, C.I.E., I.C.S., Deputy Commissioner, Khasi and Jaintia Hills, for his active co-operation given to the Department by enforcing strict quarantine of imported cattle when Rinderpest was introduced to Shillong through the migratory stock from Kamrup district so that the spread of the disease was effectively checked without further loss. This one instance explains the value of legislative measure in localising even the deadliest of the cattle diseases. 56. The Department encountered one of the worst type of epidemic of Surra amongst horses in South Sylhet subdivision this year. As this subdivision suffered from a similar lot some years back when a large number of horses were seized and des- troyed by the Department under the provisions of the Glanders and Farcy Act for Surra there had been an attempt to suppress cases by the owners so that the epidemic came to the notice of the Department rather late. Thanks to the zeal and tact of Babu Hem Chandra Sen, Veterinary Inspector, Surma Valley Circle, who was specially deputed to deal with the epidemic and carry out special curative treatment, a large number of clinical cases were brought to light and placed under treatment with such
14 great success that many owners came out later voluntarily with their sick ponies and many paid for the treatment. The result was so strikingly successful that not a single horse had to be destroyed. This is indeed a great contrast to the sad experience of mortality, natural and forced, just a few years back. Non- specific prophylactic treatment of horses for Surra was in greater demand this year which yielded a receipt of Rs.634 being the cost of the product. 57. Tick infestation of cattle is not uncommon in the pro- vince and is given but little significance by the owners. It is a definite menace to cattle. Ticks not only act as vector of many tick-borne diseases but they cause considerable economic loss to be sustained in consequence of the lowered efficiency of the tick infested live-stock during their life time and low value of the tick-damaged hides Hide is one of the important pro- ducts of live-stock that finds its way out of the province every year to be turned into finished products. It seems desirable therefore that apart from humanitarian point of view it behoves owners to pay better attention to keep their stock tick free. 58. A pathological condition of cattle which simulates Bovine Contagious Pleuro-Pneumonia clinically15 during the year under report in the Naga Hills which had been a source of great danger to public health and live-stock alike. Needless to say opening of the infected carcase and use of the in- fected meat as food had been responsible for the spread of the disease involving human lives. I take this opportunity of ex- pressing my thanks to the Deputy Commissioner, Naga Hills, for the active co-operation that was rendered by him to control the epidemic. 61. Practical difficulties having been encountered in con- trolling Anthrax in some notoriously infected localities Anthrax protective serum which gives only a transient prophylaxis was substituted by Anthrax Spore Vaccine and used with very pro- mising result even in the face of epidemic. The main difficul- ty is however that the product does not keep fit for long so that it cannot be stored in sufficient quantity. 62. Experiments were carried out with a modified dose of the Goat Tissue Vaccine (virus alone) and with normal dose of the Goat Tissue Vaccine and a controlling dose of ordinary Rinderpest Serum (sero-virus method) in a hill breed of cattle at an altitude of 2,500 feet and over above the sea level. Similar experiments were also carried out in more susceptible buffaloes. Reaction was found to vary. More work in this direction is pro- posed as opportunity may occur. 63. While there is constant complaint for more grazing lands for cattle it may not be out of place to point out that maintenance of unthrifty and inefficient cattle which the pro- vince possesses in very large number is a heavy drain on the grass and fodder resources of the province. While it is an ad- mitted fact that proper and sufficient grazing must be found for cattle it is also reasonable to suppose for every right thinking man that the grass and fodder resources of the province should be given first preference to deserving stock. If means could be devised for better grazing facilities for the improved stock it is expected that this would give incentive to better breeding. 64. Collection of figures for vital statistics of live-stock though under the existing system is done with a certain amount of check it cannot be said to be always reliable. It remains therefore to consider if some better workable method cannot be devised. Instances had been reported when mortality during epidemics had been exaggerated by the owners or interested party with ulterior motive. 65. Each flood in Assam, which is now an annual occur- rence, leaves the ryots poorer in their live-stock wealth. Its immediate baneful effect upon live-stock is too patent to be described. The remote effect of the flood upon the live-stock
16 is as serious if not more. Helminthic infestation and diseases predisposed by lowered resistance of live-stock with consequent loss of their efficiency following each flood are common occur- rence. As the deterioration of the health of stock from this source comes on slowly and at a later date it is hardly realised by the owners. It seems therefore that the cumulative after- effect of floods on the live-stock is as much a concern for stock- owners as its immediate effects. 66. Like previous years the District Veterinary Staff of this Department were closely associated with Live-stock Improve- ment work in the province. To many of them District and Subdivisional Branch Live-stock Improvement Associations owe their usefulness. They functioned as ex-officio Branch Secre- taries or Branch Agents of the Live-stock Improvement Associa- tions in addition to their normal duties as Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. During the year they attended several meetings of the Associations and inspected breeding bulls located in different parts of the province. They secured new members for the Branch Associations and collected subscriptions and donations in cash and in kind. The Circle Veterinary Inspectors also showed a keen interest in the Live-stock Improvement work and general welfare of cattle. Apart from these the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons of this province performed 31,300 castra- tions in connection with the improvement of live-stock in the province which forms the basis in any scheme of Live-stock Improvement work. I myself continued to serve as a member of the Executive Committee of the Central Live-stock Improve- ment Association, Assam. 67. It has been the earnest desire of the Department to pursue a policy of recruiting the best academically qualified candidates for veterinary education with Government stipends. The necessity of such a course is indicated by the fact that at least one of the Vererinary Colleges in India has already been affiliated to the University for the Bachelor Degree in veterinary science. For this and to keep pace with the recent advancement in veterinary science its necessity was never so pressing as it is to-day. It is a happy feature that there is now no dearth of qualified youths who arc keen for veterinary education with Government stipends. 68. It is indeed a very healthy sign that the representatives of ryots, in the Local Self-Government Institutions have been truly ventilating the feelings of their constituency by pressing for more Veterinary Institutions. I record my high appreciation of three Local Boards, viz.,17 jurisdiction. It is pleasing to report that Barpeta, Gauhati, Sunamganj, Jorhat and Sibsagar Local Boards are also trying to find their ways and means to have more Veterinary Institutions under them. Government have been pleased not only to extend the term of the temporary officer in the rank of the Veterinary Inspector but have also sanctioned two more posts of Reserve Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and four Government Veterinary Assistant Surgeons under Local Boards on permanent basis. These are excluding 43 posts of Veterinary Field Assistants which the Government have sanctioned. For the last-named posts recruits are now undergoing a practical course of training in the Gauhati Hospital under a capable and experienced Instructor. This expansion has taken place since the close of the year in spite of adverse finance of the province. The Department which has been steering through troubled waters, never before felt the necessity of its thorough re-organisation as it does to day. I am therefore extremely grateful to the Government and the Legislature and to those of the Local Boards which have acti- vely co-operated for this expansion. I hope that the good example shown by Nowgong, Dibrugarh and Hailakandi Local Boards will inspire other Boards in the province for strengthen- ing their veterinary staff. 69. For the first time a veterinary subordinate was given a chance of temporary deputation to the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute in Muktesar on the recommendation of the Department for the post of an upper subordinate in the Ins- titute. The idea underlying such temporary recruitment is to give the deserving staff an opportunity of picking up as far as possible the scientific work in the Institute so that the experi- ence gained there may be applied to the province when he reverts, practically at no cost but to immense benefit of the province. 70. The departmental activities have so enormously in- creased that it is considered imperative to give the Head of the Department some relief from his routine work. Necessity for the revival of the post of the Deputy Superintendent which has been held in abeyance was never so keenly felt as it is to-day. While it is felt that for efficient administration close supervision and control are indispensably necessary it is idle to suppose that the Head of the Department should be able to personally look into every detail alone and discharge the responsibility efficiently single-handed when the Depart- ment has recently expanded to nearly double of its original strength and activities have increased manyfold.
18 71. While there is a great rush of candidates for all other services paucity of qualified veterinary graduates who are natives of the province still continues so that all vacancies in the rank of Veterinary Assistant Surgeon could not be filled up. With a view to remedy this Government have raised the num- ber of veterinary stipends from two to five this year. Even then the situation will not be eased as the retirement of senior Veterinary Assistant Surgeons is drawing well nigh. So with a view to recoup this and meet the growing demand of expan- sion of the Department some remedy to augment recruitment appears to be an urge. It is therefore a matter for considera- tion whether besides award of Government stipends some other facilities cannot be extended to deserving candidates who desire to go for veterinary education. Reservation of a fixed number of seats in the Bengal Veterinary College for non-stipendiary natives of Assam might prove helpful. 72. In spite of unprecedented expansion of work and depart- mental activities the Department had been run very economi- cally. What a tremendous saving it had been to the Government Exchequer and a blessing to the stock-owners by reason of int o- duction of the Goat Tissue Vaccine as a prophylactic against Rinderpest will be understood when I say that there had been a saving of nearly a lakh of rupees this year alone, which would have otherwise been required for the purchase of more costly and less efficient Anti-Rinderpest Serum against the incredibly cheap and highly efficient Goat Tissue Vaccine. The Department has therefore very good reasons to feel extremely gratified not only for the enlarged and efficient service it had been able to render to the ryots but also for the substantial monetary relief it had been able to secure to the Government on their obligatory expenses when the Government are faced with acute financial difficulties and the Resources and Retrenchment Committee had been devising means to secure economy. 73. The Hon'ble Minister in charge of the Veterinary De- partment was pleased to pay a visit to the Veterinary Institute and Laboratory at Gauhati headquarters and the Veterinary Hospital at Silchar during the year. It was indeed a great encouragement to the Department and to the staff. 74. Technical staff of the Department worked on the whole exceedingly well. My Circle Inspectors and the special Veterinary Inspector did everything possible by them to main- main the standard of efficiency. I am glad to be able to say that they ali quite fittingly shared with me the extraordinary strain of duty evolved upon the Department. I therefore feel
19 it my bounden duty to record in writing and to bring to the notice of the Government the excellent work done by the entire staff. 75. To my office I have nothing but my appreciation for their assiduous work. With increased activities of the Depart- ment office work has immensely increased so that one additional clerk sanctioned and entertained on permanent basis has been found to be inadequate. A fresh proposal will soon be submit- ted to the Government for reorganisation of the ministerial staff without which it is difficult to maintain the efficiency. My thanks are due to Maulavi Muhammad Eunus, my Head clerk, who did everything possible under the limitation. 76. I take this opportunity to thank those of the public who showed keen interest by actively co-operating with the Department and to the District and Subdivisional Officers and the Chairmen, Local Boards, for their everincreasing interest in all matters relating to the Department contributing towards its progress. I am indebted to the Director, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, for the continued active assis- tance he had rendered me through the various Departments of his Institute. My thanks are also due to the Animal Husban- dry Commissioner with the Government of India and to the Director, Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, for their con- tinued co-operation and to Dr. S. K. Mitra, Ph.D., m.s., i.a.s., Director of Agriculture, Assam, for assistance he has rendered me and my staff in carrying out veterinary work in the Govern- ment Farms under his control. S. GHOSH, Director of Veterinary Department, Assam.

READ2 Government note with satisfaction the very rapid increase in the volume of work performed by the staff showing an increase in cases dealt with by the department from 3,06,990 to 4,70,718 during the year under report. To lighten the strain on the overworked staff additional posts of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were sanctioned, but owing to the dearth of qualified local candidates these posts could not be filled up. The 43 Veterinary Field Assistants sanctioned during the year were put under training and on its completion have been posted to differ- ent districts except one who got plucked in the test examination. It has been proposed to train another batch of such Assistants and provision for more stipends has been proposed in the next year's budget. In addition to this increasingly heavy normal duties, the officers of the department took a very keen interest in the work of the Assam Livestock Association and worked in close co-opera- tion with the Livestock section of the Agriculture Department. Besides inspecting breeding bulls and attending meetings of the branch Associations, the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons secured new members, collected subscriptions and donations for the Associations and castrated as many as 31,300 weedy bulls in suitable areas. A satisfactory feature of the year was that there were only 14 cases for which medicines were supplied but not brought to the Government Veterinary Hospitals as against 592 cases of the previous year. This as well as the rapid expansion of work testify to the popularity of the department for which the Direc- tor and his staff are to be congratulated. Rai Sahib Srish Chandra Ghosh deserves thanks for his efficient administration of the department and also for his inter- esting report. By order of the Governor of Assam S.

(Muktesar), DIRECTOR OF VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, ASSAM, To THE DEPUTY SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ASSAM, EDUCATION AND LOCAL SELF- GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS, SHILLONG. Dated Gauhati, the 21st August 1940. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Annual Adminis- tration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, for the year 1939-40. Your obedient servant, S. C. GHOSE, Director of Veterinary Department, Assam.
Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, for the year 1939-40 PREFACE.2 A Serious Epidemic of Foot-and-Mouth disease involving the entire valuable stock of the Upper Shillong Farm which maintains pure and Gross English bred cattle caused consider- able anxiety to the Department so that I personally visited the Farm and organised control and remedial measures. Though the loss was negligible3 During the period Mr. V. R. Gopalakrishnan was in charge he was on tour for 98 days and travelled 1,780 miles by road and 3,563 miles by rail. He visited 15 villages, 12 Tea Estates, 4 Government Farms and 2 Jail Dairies in connection with investigation of animal diseases. 7. The following diseases were investigated by Mr. V. R. Gopalakrishnan:4 College from Assam in the second year class. It is however to be regretted that both of them failed in the annual examination of the College. PART II.5 BOVINE (CATTLE AND BUFFALOES) 19. Rinderpest.6 30. Foot and Mouth disease.7 breaks and 2,78,812 animals were vaccinated and inoculated (only 1,998 having been done in the serum alone method) and amongst the vaccinated and inoculated 1,724 died subsequently. 38. Anthrax.8 VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES 43. Table III shows the work of the three Government Veterinary Hospitals in the province, viz., Gauhati, Silchar and Shillong. The total number of animals treated in these Hospi- tals during the year under report including both in and out-pa- tients was 8, 221 against 7,844 in the previous year, and the total number of castrations performed during the year was 658 against 542 in the previous year. The total number of cases supplied with medicines but not brought to the Hospitals was 30 against 14 of the previous year. The total Hospital receipts amounted to Rs.1,104 against Rs.1,066 in the previous year. The figures above indicate an all round improvement of work including receipts done by the Veterinary Hospitals this year as compared with the previous year. 44. Gauhati Veterinary Hospital.9 48. Table V is a new statement and it shows the number of castrations performed and the number of cases treated district by district. These figures have been worked out from the state- ments in Table III and Table IV. The figures of live-stock population have been obtained from the report of Cattle Census held in 1935. PART III.10 PART IV.11 he was on tour for 66 days and travelled 722 miles by rail and 1,508 miles by road. He tested and re- tested 429 animals for Johne's disease with Avian Tuberculin and Johnin in the Government Cattle Breeding Farms at Khanapara, Jorhat and Sylhet. He was specially deputed to study the reaction of Goat Tissue Vaccine in Bhutia breed Hill Cattle and to treat a valuable Government elephant belonging to the Forest Department at Kulsi. He attended the Minett Committee held in Shillong in March 1940 to review the present Johne's disease situation in the province. At the request of the Organisers of the Adult Literacy Campaign he was deputed to give a lantern lecture at the Cotton College, Gauhati, on the economic value of cattle and their importance in Agriculture in India. (2) Babu Hem Chandra Sen, Veterinary Inspector, held charge of the Surma Valley Circle throughout the year. He was on tour for 203 days and travelled 2,184 miles by rail, 208 miles by steamer and 1,741 miles by road and boat. He visited and revisited 127 villages and Tea Estates in connection with the inspection of the work of the Veterinary Assistant. Surgeons, investigation of diseases, enquiry into the results of vaccination, inoculation, castrations, etc. The following Hospital and Dispensaries were inspected by him:12 (3) Maulavi Fariduddin Ahmed, Veterinary Inspector, held charge of the Upper Assam Circle from the 1st April 1939 to the 15th December 1939. He retired from service with effect from the 16th December 1939. During the period he was in charge of the Upper Assam Circle he spent 114 days on tour, travelled 716 miles by rail, 222 miles by steamer and 1,938 miles by road and boat. He visited and revisited 183 villages and Tea Estates in connection with the inspection of the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, investigation of disease, enquiry into the results of inoculation and vaccination. He inspected the following Veterinary Dispensaries :13 from the 2nd to the 26th October 1939. He was on tour for 82 days and travelled 723 miles by rail, 36 miles by steamer, and 1,081 miles by road. He visited 50 villages in connection with the inspec- tion of the work of the Veterinary Assistant Sur- geons, investigation of diseases and enquiry into the results of inoculation and vaccination. While in charge of the Central Assam Circle he inspected the following Veterinary Hospital and Dispensaries :14 at Tezpur, and breeding bulls of the Agricultural Department and Livestock Improvement Association in his circle. SCIENTIFIC AND OTHER IMPORTANT WORK 57. The Department continued its usual normal activities. Besides research and investigation were done on the following pathological conditions amongst other things:15 PART VI.16 adopted by the Department during the recent years not only considerably added to the efficiency of the Department but during the last five years the Department had been able to secure an economy to the Government Exchequer of an amount which might be safely assessed to over four and half lakhs of rupees as may be seen from a quinquennial review given below of only one item of work, viz., Goat-Tissue-Vaccine inoculation against Rinderpest:17 as apprehended in certain quarters. The Department and the Government are fully conscious to the necessity of strengthening scientifically trained Veterinary officers which is clearly evident by their move in sanctioning more Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and greater number of veterinary stipends for education of our youths in the Bengal Veterinary College during the current year in spite of recruitment of Veterinary Field Assistants. There is hardly any room to question that the Department would not continue its onward march. 63. While the question of cattle breeding has been enga- ging attention of all concerned in the general welfare of livestock it will not do to forget that the question of nutrition and disease-control of stock should have as much, if not a greater attention. The need of raising a disease-resisting stock cannot be too strongly emphasised. Animal nutrition, disease-control and scientific cattle breeding should be co-ordinated in such a way that maximum result might be secured at a minimum cost. The veterinary and the livestock improvement work is so inti- mately connected that both are interwoven and inseparable from one another. To know the livestock in health one must know the livestock in disease because what is true of the Public Health and the Medical Departments is also true of the Animal Health and the Veterinary Departments. So to keep the Live- stock Section separate from and independent of the Veterinary Department is, to my mind, to keep the soul out of the body. To what national benefit these two branches can be amalgama- ted is answered by the Punjab Veterinary Department where the livestock and the veterinary work is under the unified and undivided control of the Director of Veterinary Services so that the Punjab to-day rightly feels proud as the foremost province in livestock resources in India. The same is to be found in the North West Frontier Province. Good example of the Punjab had lately inspired Madras so that the Livestock Section of the Agriculture Department there had recently been transferred and placed under the Director of Veterinary Department, Madras. Bihar, the United Provinces and the Central Provinces have made a beginning. Even the new province of Orissa has follow- ed the good example. If utmost benefit is to be secured, if effi- ciency and economy are to be combined, if Assam is to pool well directed energy and scientific intelligence together, if she is to have a powerful and productive Animal Husbandry Depart- ment to the greatest benefit of the province where livestock is the mainstay of 95 per cent. of the population I visualise that Assam cannot follow a different course. It needs hardly be emphasised that the veterinary service is the rock-bed of sound foundation on which livestock section can stand and thrive with safety.
18 64. While unemployment amongst educated middle class Bhadraloks is an acute problem engaging serious thoughts of Government and public alike it cannot be denied that acute economic depression of our ryots arising out of loss of cattle every year is no less a serious problem. Attempts to improve agriculture and livestock which daily and directly concern our ryots will continue to be in jeopardy so long we may not be able to effectively control the huge drainage upon the cattle resources of our ryots. To save the life of a pair of plough bullocks or a couple of milch cows is a greater relief to an average ryot than what is accrued from relief given otherwise, viz., agricultural loan, remission of land revenue, etc., for which such a vigorous plea is put forward by the press and the public which by reflect- ing on the Government revenue is bound to affect other benefi- cial measures of national importance. A ryot is happier to see his field laden with crop and his cattle-shed full of efficient and productive stock. Loss of a pair of bullocks, specially in plough- ing season, is a double-edged weapon which cuts an ill-clad and ill-fed cultivator both ways. He not only loses his valuable cattle but he has to leave his otherwise arable land a fallow to starve himself and his family unless he desperately gives himself up to the clutches of money-lenders which in itself in many cases makes a cultivator eventually homeless. As the real test of a nation-building department lies in its usefulness to the great- est number of people of the nation the Civil Veterinary Depart- ment as the custodian of livestock of the province is ever anxious to do as much as possible. To attain this there can be no two opinion that we must have an enlarged and a thoroughly reorga- nised veterinary department. I tried to impress this one fact in the past and I repeat that we can no more afford to give this factor an importance next to any other national project. I am glad to be able to report that further reorganisation of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, is now contemplated and scheme for the same will soon be submitted to the Government for their consideration. 65. While the Government have been exploring every venue to strengthen the Veterinary Department in Assam it is to be regretted that in spite of earnest appeal by the Depart- ment the Local Boards except in solitary instances did not so far seem to actively appreciate the necessity of increasing the veteri- nary staff maintained by them. I hope the Local Boards will agree with me when I say that to administer veterinary aid over a vast area covered by an entire subdivision with a huge num- ber of livestock by two Veterinary Assistant Surgeons is more an apology in the name of rendering service. To meet this uncom- fortable situation the Government had to employ extra staff of
19 forty-two Veterinary Field Assistants during the year under re- port and the department had frequently to depute the reserve officers to supplement the district staff. The Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, has passed the stage of infancy and grown into adolescence requiring adequate number of duly qualified staff but for which loss of cattle is bound to continue. To let cattle die in such large number is to kill a goose which lays gold- en eggs. So every self-governing institution, every society, every community, every individual, who has the good of the nation at heart, has to pause and think seriously how to save cattle20 68. I desire to record a simple yet very cheap and effect- ive curative treatment evolved by the writer of this report for two of the most fatal and highly infectious diseases of cattle, viz., Anthrax and Hæmorrhagic Septicaemia. This treatment had been given such extensive trials for several years in the field that it can now be safely declared that an ordinary bazar drug (Camphor), which many a household possesses, is a specific for these two fatal diseases which cause great loss to ryots year after year. The process of treatment is so simple and the ingredient so readily available even in the remotest corner in a village bazar that the treatment can be resorted to by average ryots themselves. As a matter of fact the treatment has become so popular in the province that it is now adopted by villagers themselves without waiting for Veterinary Surgeons with excellent result. Before the result of the treatment was made known to the public the Department carried out this treatment in many microscopically confirmed epidemics of Anthrax and Hæmorrhagic Septicaemia keeping control. The result so far obtained (about 70 per cent. cure as opposed to 100 per cent. mortality amongst the untreated) is a mile-stone in the history of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam. 69. South Sylhet Subdivision had again been a victim of severe type of Equine Surra. However, cases confirmed micros- copically were given prompt treatment and they responded successfully. As a result of extensive trials the short course treatment evolved in this province has been found to be safe and effective. The field workers are able to carry out the treatment without difficulty as the scheme of dosage is very simple. A statistical survey on the line of treatment adopted now as a routine measure clearly indicates that this is a method of choice both for clinical cases as well as in prophy- laxis. 70. A detailed survey of the Epizootology of a pathologi- cal condition of cattle simulating Bovine Contagious Pleuro- pneumonia clinically and further investigation into etiology were conducted during the year in collaboration with the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar. Examina- tion of morbid materials and transmission experiments seem to indicate the presence of fungoid bodies of the nature of Blastomyces as the probable cause of the specific nature of pneumonic lesions in the affected animals. Although experi- mental findings do not appear to be conclusive, the clinical observation in the actual outbreaks, the tendency for the pro- gressive spread of the disease, the high rate of mortality, etc., point to the possibility of the disease being identical with the
21 classic Bovine contagious pleuro-pneumonia with such slight variation in the severity as are likely to appear within the boundaries of any bacterial or virus disease. I shall not there- fore wonder if further research and investigation tend to prove the pathological condition to be the one and the same as Bovine contagious Pleuro-pneumonia from which India is supposed to be free. 71. Investigation on Kumri in horse was continued. In addition to the clinical and pathological observation experi- mental work was in progress to elucidate the cause of the disease by biological tests for the study of a neurotropic filtrable virus as there seems to be an evidence of a close pathological relationship between Kumri and Equine Encephalamyelities. As opportunity occurs this line of approach of the problem will be pursued further in collaboration with the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar. 72. The problem of Johne's Disease amongst cattle in Government Farms in particular and in the province in general, has been engaging the anxious thoughts and serious attention of the Veterinary Department for some years now. The effec- tive application of the recommendations of the Committee headed by Mr. F. Ware, C.I.E., F.R.C.V.S., F.N.I., I.V.S., Animal Husbandry Commissioner with the Government of India, gave ample indication of success in the control of the disease in Government Farms as reported by the Second Ware Committee and evidenced by substantial reduction in the incidence of the disease in the Farms. Unfortunately however, for reasons which were beyond the control of my Department, the disease mounted again. However when the situation again assumed a retrograde turn the Local Government seized the opportunity of a visit by Dr. Minett, D.Sc., M.R.C.V.S., Director of Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar, who reviewed the Johne's Disease situation when he visited the province towards the close of the year. Dr. Minett's recommendations are now under consideration of the Government. 73. A comparative diagnostic test with Johnin and Avia Tuberculin simultaneously in 206 cattle of Government Farms was carried out during the year under report and very interes- ting observations were recorded. The result of field tests of this nature are of much importance. It is indeed of great value in the study of methods of diagnosis as an aid to solve the problem of control of Johne's Disease. I take this oppor- tunity to thank Mr. K. Krishna Iyengar, Superintendent of Mysore Civil Veterinary Department, for assisting me with supply of Johnin free of charge manufactured in his Serum
22 Institute to carry out this comparative test. Another sugges- tion interpreted by this test is that though Tuberculosis had not so far been detected in cattle in Assam the result of this test indicated that it is worth while to take up an investigation in that direction. 74. The economic loss in animal wealth and lowered efficiency of cattle accruing from helminthic infestation about which I also made mention in my previous report is indeed fairly high in Assam. It is extremely fortunate that the Depart- ment during the year under report has been able to make a survey in certain centres in collaboration with Dr. G. S. Thapar, M.Sc., ph.D. (London), Officer in-charge of Helminthiasis scheme of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research attached to the Lucknow University. A plan of work for a pre- liminary field experiment for the comparative and seasonal study of the degree of helminthic infestation is now contem- plated and preliminary measures are being taken to start the work. 75. Vaccination against Rinderpest with Goat Tissue Vaccine both in absence as well as in actual seats of outbreak had again been demonstrated with very encouraging results. While this disease alone was again responsible for more than half of the mortality of cattle in Assam during the year under report it is gratifying to record that the loss amongst the vacci- nated cattle again proved to be less than negligible 1 per cent. It is gratifying that the popularity of Rinderpest preventive vac- cination with the Goat-Tissue-Vaccine is phenomenal and there had been such an increasing demand for this operation from the public that the number of Goat-Tissue-Vaccine inoculation had excelled the capacity of the present staff necessitating the employment of Veterinary Field Assistants. 76. During the year investigation into an out-break of disease amongst sheep simulating Rinderpest clinically was carried out in the Lakhimpur district. The disease on clinical basis was tentatively diagnosed as Rinderpest pending further investigation. It was reported that the flock of sheep was brought by road marches from Muzaffarpur (Bihar) to Assam. The disease broke out almost immediately after their purchase in two Tea Estates. Immediate control measures were adopted to check the spread of infection. One feature of the disease was that it was exclusively confined amongst the imported sheep and no cattle or goat caught the infection though they were grazing and moving almost on the same, pasture land.
23 77. A very severe type of Foot and Mouth disease as already mentioned broke out in the Upper Shillong Government Farm where in spite of all rigid attention and measures almost the entire stock became infected which presented a very serious problem to the Department to handle. The stock in the Farm represented quite a good number of pure and cross bred English cattle. As the disease in English and Cross-English cattle as well as well-bred heavy animals is by far more severe than what is seen in ordinary indigenous cattle the disease occurred in its worst form so far seen in Assam. As many as 87 animals were attacked leaving only a residual stock of three highly resistant cattle unaffected. In fact the epidemic so seriously threatened the Farm that I had to pay my personal attendance and with the active assistance of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Shil- long the loss was limited to death of negligible minimum of 3 only, due to secondary complications of Pneumonia and Pyemia. While it is gratifying to record that the life of such a valuable stock could be saved by active and efficient treatment rendered by the Department the Farm had to suffer as the diseased stock went economically unproductive for some time. 78. A very severe type of Goat-Pox (confirmed by the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute) broke out in the Khanapara Cattle Farm amongst 23 imported goats obtained from the United Provinces immediately on their arrival. As a matter of fact the disease broke out en route so that 3 animals died in the train and 15 died on their arrival in the Farm. Peculiarly enough not a single of the local goats already in the Farm died though the disease extended to the stock and as many as 43 were affected with the disease. 79. Slow breeding and sterility had been reported from time to time. Hormone treatment was adopted in such cases and responded satisfactorily. For this purpose detoxicated urine from pregnant cows in doses of 10 c.c. per 100 pound body weight of cattle was given subcutancously with very satis- factory result. 80. The Hon'ble Minister for Veterinary Department of Assam paid a visit to the Headquarters Institutions at Gauhati and to the Veterinary Institution at Nowgong during the year under report. The Institute at Gauhati was also visited by Dr. Minett, D.Sc., M.R.C.V.S., Director, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar, and by Dr. G. S. Thapar, M.Sc., ph.D., (London), Officer in-charge of Helminthiasis Scheme of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. The value of such visits is immense and it is an encouragement to the Department and to the staff.
24 81. The Department has become poorer by premature death of one of its devoted officers in the person of late Maulvi Aktar Ahmed, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon who died in har- ness when he very nearly completed his service. While I deeply regret the loss sustained by the death of this senior member of the Department I take this opportunity to place on record the good service he rendered to the Department. The Department also regrets to lose the services of Maulvi F. Ahmed, Veterinary Inspector, who after a full career proceeded on well-earned pension with effect from the 16th December 1939. I record my high appreciation of service he had so loyally and jealously rendered to the Department. 82. My entire technical staff applied themselves unsparingly and with great enthusiasm to their duties. But for their zeal and unflinching and loyal devotion to departmental instructions the report I submit now might present a different picture. My Inspectors did everything for furtherence of the cause for which they were employed. I should like to record that Mr. V. R. Gopalakrishnan, G.M.V.C., P.G. (Muktesar), the newly appoint- ed Veterinary Investigation Officer, during the short period of his service in Assam had proved himself to be an acquisition to the Department. I wish to record once more my appreciation of service which my office staff under the supervision of my Head Clerk, Maulvi Muhammad Eunus rendered. Being under- staffed both the technical and ministerial officers had to work under difficulties. They should have this much consolation that I was not unmindful of their needs and have been able to obtain the Government sanction of one Field Veterinary Assis- tant for each of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and three more office assistants which must have gone a great way to ease the difficult situation. 83. I take this opportunity to thank the Commissioner of Divisions, Deputy Commissioners, Subdivisional Officers, and Chairmen, Local Boards, for assistance they had rendered me. With very great pleasure I also acknowledge the keen interest which peoples' representatives in the Assam Legislative Assem- bly had shown in veterinary matters. I must not forget the ryots with whom I had the pleasure of mixing very intimately and whose voice hardly goes beyond the boundaries of rural areas. To them I have nothing but my sincere thanks for their active co-operation with the Department. I must also thank the Animal Husbandry Commissioner with the Government of India and to the Director of Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar, for their co-operation. My thanks are also due to .he Director, Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, for the
25 assistance he rendered my Department through his Veterinary Vaccine Section though at times our demad for the supply of Goat-Tissue-Vaccine had been unusually heavy. I also mention the name of Dr. S. K. Mitra, Ph.D., M.S., I.A.S., Director of Agriculture, Assam, for the assistance he rendered me and my staff in carrying out veterinary work in the Government Farms under his control. 84. Before I close I think my report will be incomplete if I fail to express my deepest sense of gratitude to the Government for their active support in every measure I placed before them for their consideration but for which I could not achieve the results. S. C. GHOSE, Director of Veterinary Department, Assam.

No. 9GOVERNMENT OF ASSAM ORDERS BY THE GOVERNOR Resolution on the Veterinary Report for the year 1939-40 Extract from the proceedings of the Government of Assam in the Educa- tion Department, No.752-E., dated the 28th March 1941. READ2 against 1,743 deaths in the previous year. Only 5 animals subsequently died out of a number of 2,423 animals which were inoculated with Anthrax Spore Vaccine. The Director of Veterinary Department reports that he has found out a simple method of treatment of animals attacked with Haemorrhagic Septicaemia and Anthrax, by which numerous cattle are being saved at comparatively nominal cost. The problem of Johne's disease among the cattle in the Government Farms and also elsewhere in the Province has been causing anxieties for sometime. A Veterinary Investigation Officer was appointed to carry on investigation on this and other diseases, the cost of which was partly met by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. It appears that some of the Local Boards have not so far appreciated the necessity of increasing the Veterinary Staff under them. No import of costly stock and no improvement in cattle breed will be of any avail unless the Local Boards come forward with a determination to control effectively the huge drainage upon the cattle resources in their local areas. The Director of Veterinary Department reports that the present dual control of the District Veterinary Staff by the Veterinary Department and the Local Boards was not working satisfactorily due to certain restrictions imposed on Veterinary Assistant Surgeons by some Local Boards, which interfered with the activities of the Department. It is hoped that the Local Boards will give no cause for adverse criticisms in future. Government note with satisfaction that the Department has maintained a steady progress and has been gaining in popula- rity. Their thanks are due to the Director of Veterinary Department, Rai Sahib Srish Chandra Ghose for his very efficient administration and interesting and illuminating report. On the eve of his retirement in the current year they take this opportunity of acknowledging the valuable services rendered by him in bringing about an all round improvement in the Department. By order of the Governor of Assam A. HYE CHAUDHURI, Deputy Secretary to the Government of Assam, Education and Local Self-Government Departments. A. G. P. (Edn.)

No. R1-5/3791 FROM RAI SAHIB SRISH CHANDRA GHOSE, G.B.V.C., P.G. (Muktesar), DIRECTOR OF VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, ASSAM, To THE DEPUTY SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ASSAM, EDUCATION AND LOCAL SELF- GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS, SHILLONG. Dated Gauhati, the 8th September 1941. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Annual Adminis- tration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, for the year 1940-41. Your obedient servant, S. C. GHOSE, Director of Veterinary Department, Assam.
Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, for the year 1940-41 PREFACE.2 6. The following diseases were investigated by the Veterinary Investiga- tion Officer during the year :3 14 Dourine. -No death was reported from this disease as in the previous year. 15. Anthrax.4 32. Other contagious and parasitic diseases.5 In all 260 bovines were inoculated of which 1 died subsequently. In the previous year 1 outbreak was reported in which 2 bovines died uninoculated in course of the outbreak, 26 bovines were inoculated6 at the beginning of the year was 620 and the number at the close of the year was 741. In all there were 47,538 breeding bulls in the province, i.e., entire males over 3 years kept or used for breeding purposes according to the Cattle Census of 1935. 47. Table VI-B shows the number of approved buffalo bulls at stud in the province. There were only 5 buffalo bulls at stud in the beginning of the year and at the close of the year the number was 13. There were in all 19,075 buffalo bulls in the province, i.e., the entire male buffaloes over 3 years kept or used for breeding purpose according to the Cattle Census held in 1935. 48. Table VI-C shows the number of horse or donkey stallion at stud in the province. There was only 1 horse at stud during the year against none in the previous year. CATTLE FAIRS AND SHOWS 49. Table VII shows the number of cattle fairs and shows held in the province during the year as reported by the Deputy Commissioners. There were in all 4 fairs and shows in 3 districts as against 8 in 6 districts in the previous year. The Department as usual participated by opening stalls and exhibiting specimens, models, charts, etc. Lectures on the general welfare of cattle and measures for prevention of contagious diseases were given and departmental leaflets were distributed. STATISTICS OF LIVE-STOCK SLAUGHTERED 50. Table VIII shows the statistics of livestock slaughtered in slaughter houses in the province during the year. This statement has been adopted from the last year only and the figures have been collected through the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. The number of recognised slaughter houses was reported to be 2 under Government and 63 under Local Bodies against 1 under Government and 50 under Local Bodies in the previous year. The number of unrecognised slaughter houses was reported to be 49 against 41 in the previous year. In these slaughter houses 67,048 animals of all kind were slaughtered during the year against 61,796 animals in the previous year. PART IV.7 were re-employed as Veterinary Assistant Surgeons on a temporary basis to fill up some of the vacancies which are lying in the cadre of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. 52. A brief account of the work performed by the Johne's Disease Officer and the Veterinary Inspectors during the year is given below :8 He inspected the Dairy Cattle in Silchar and Gauhati Jails and breeding bulls of the Livestock Improvement Association as opportunity oc urred. He also inspected the Dairy Cattle and sheep of the 3rd Assam Rifles and Kohima Jail. He visited the Rural Uplift Centres in his circle and gave necessary instructions to the persons concerned. (3) Babu Annada Mohan Das, Veterinary Inspector held charge of the Lower Assam Circle from the beginning of the year up to the 15th December 1940. He retired from service on superannuation pension with effect from the 16th December 1940. He was on tour for 87 days and travelled 1,594 miles by rail, 70 miles by steamer and 836 miles by road and boat in con- nection with the inspection of the work of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and Veterinary Field Assistants, investigation of diseases, enquiry into the results of vaccination, inculation, castrations, etc. The following Veterinary Dispensaries were inspected by him :9 He inspected the following Veterinary Dispensaries in the Lower Assam Circle :10 incurred for the Veterinary Investigation Officer, Assam debitable to the grant of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Rese?rch. 55. The Local Boards in Assam incurred the following expenditure in connection with Veterinary Charges. These figures were furnished by the Local Boards:11 Department responsible for such a beneficial measure brought to the doors of our ill-clad and ill-fed ryots can reasonably feel proud. I visualise that the progressive application of this incredibly cheap yet very effective method of active immunisation would one day lead Assam to be almost Rinderpest free to the great relief of ryots, of the Civil Veterinary Department and of the Government alike. 58. While prophylactic treatment has earned such a popularity further appreciation of services rendered by the Department is signified by the fact that despite the year being healthy from the view point of contagious diseases there had been substantial increase in the total number of cases treated which stands at 1,94,632 this year as against 1,77,270 of the last year. This progress proves beyond a shadow of doubt that the ryots have been increasingly realising the value of scientific veterinary aid so that they are coming with greater number of sick animals to the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons for treatment whether in the interior or in the dispensaries and hospitals. 59. It is equally gratifying to record that the first and foremost step for improvement of livestock, to wit, emasculation of weedy bulls has been receiving very close attention of the Department so that the volume of service rendered in this direction has been quite significant and showed a considerable improvement over that of any of the preceding years. Thus the total number of castrations performed in bloodless method with Burdiz- zio's castrator, which was first introduced in India by the Civil Veteri- nary Department, Assam, stood at 37,364 as against 33,997 of the last year. 60. Another redeeming feature is that ail told there had been a total mortality of 35,017 animals this year against 48,317 of the last year and 59,241 of the year 1938-39. Nothing could be more eloquent proof of efficient veterinary service than this. The appreciation of service rendered is also exhibited in the constant demand from ryots and private organi- sations on the Department on the Local Boards and sometimes direct on the Government and also in the floor of the Legislative Assembly for more veterinary institutions in the province specially in rural areas sometimes even with voluntary offer of land and money. 61. The value of livestock in India in all its bearing according to the latest information given by the Principal Information Officer with the Government of India is estimated at two thousand crores of rupees12 It would thus appear that the Civil Veterinary Department as the custodian of livestock contributes immensely to conserve the chief national Wealth of the country. Besides its share of contribution towards public health through control of milk and meat borne diseases and through control of other intercommunicable diseases between man and animal, though very little thought of, has been immense. In fact veterinary service is of such national importance that it should engage serious thought and attention of every one who has the good of the country at heart. Any expenditure however significant should be considered to have been well spent to reorga- nise and develop this much needed and most useful of the nation-building departments. To retrace its past history one cannot deny that the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, had not been given the same attention as had been given to other nation building departments. 62. The Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, besides control of and scientific investigation and research into animal diseases took an active interest and substantially contributed to the work of livestock improvement in Assam. I myself acted as an Ex-officio member of the Executive Com- mittee of the Provincial Livestock Improvement Association, Assam. Twenty-six of my Veterinary Assistant Surgeons served as Branch Secretaries or Agents of Branch Livestock Improvement Associations in districts and Subdivisions. They in all attended 32 meetings, inspected 207 breeding bulls stationed in different districts, castrated 34,251 scrub bulls in connec- tion with livestock improvement work. Besides they secured 37 members to the Association and collected donation of bulls and cash money to the extent of Rs.480. It would thus appear that contribution of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, towards the improvement of livestock is not mean. 63. The question of more grazing lands and grazing reserves is a burning one and too much pressure is being brought upon for more grazing areas. While the anxiety of livestock owners to add to the already existing grazing lands is appreciated it must be said that it is not an unmixed blessing. If the cause of propagation of such highly infectious diseases as Rinderpest, Anthrax, Foot and Mouth Disease, helminthic infection, etc., which put a heavy drain on cattle resources of the province each year, is traced it will be found that not infrequently these are gifts of common pasture lands where large number of cattle from different areas are congre- gated for grazing. There is still the other side of the shield to be looked at. It must be conceded that general indifference of average cattle owners to grow fodder is too patent a fact requiring comments. If this common apathy is even partly attributable to the existing grazing facilities in Assam then provision of extended grazing areas is bound to have a greater repercussion on our livestock. It seems therefore that to resist diseases and to make our stock more efficient we should not only overcome injudicious breeding, milk-starvation of calves and over-stocking but we must also educate our ryots to grow sufficient fodders for cattle in their own control- lable limited holdings. 64. While contagious diseases reflect very seriously on any attempt to improve the animal industry in Assam nefarious activities of cattle poison- ing by interested parties for hides and bones under the cover of epidemics and sometimes oven in absence of epidemics put the last straw on camel's back so that ignorant ryots sustain heavy losses year after year seldom realising the mischief wrought upon them. While I acknowledge with thanks the active co-operation of the executive authorities with the Civil Veterinary Department, in respect of some of the affected areas which had
13 partly controlled this, vile practice (as it was in Sunamganj Subdivision) it occurs to me that systematic operations against it is necessary. The Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, has been investigating into various methods applied in carrying out the mischief and proposes to leave nothing undone to effectively check it on the basis of the results of this investigation. 65. Poultry breeding has been in operation in Assam not only in some of the Government Farms but it has been taken up by many private indi- viduals. Poultry breeding is thus gaining ground even as a cottage indus- try so that almost every household resort to rearing and breeding poultry in rural areas as a lucrative business. It is a definite source of income solving economic problem at least to a certain extent to many a poor owner. Unquestionably this offers scope for a subsidiary source of income to many in this province. There however can be hardly any denial that thousands of birds perish every year from known and other little investi- gated poultry diseases which have been seriously affecting the progress of poultry industry in Assam. The Department and the Government have given their anxious thought to remedy this and with this object in view initiated a scheme for research and investigation into poultry diseases in Assam. It is gratifying to record that the Imp rial Council of Agricultural Research having appreciated the value of the scheme have been pleased to agree to take financial responsibility with the Government of Assam on 50: 50 basis. It is now proposed to depute a suitable Veterinary Officer for training in Poultry Husbandry and Poultry Diseases in the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, so that the scheme may be operated in collaboration with the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute as soon as possible. 66. Further investigation on epizootiology of the pathological condi- tion of cattle simulating Bovine Contagious Fleure-Pneumonia as reported in paragraph 70 of my annual report of 1939-40 was carried out in col- laboration with the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar. Results of this investigation and research indicate that my observation that this pathological condition is the one and the same as classic Bovine Contagious Pleuro Pneumonia was appropriate. Though India was sup- posed to be free from this fell disease it is no good hiding the fact that spasmodic incidence of this disease has been known in Assam for over two decades and it has been responsible for considerable economic loss to the Assam Valley. The causal organism of this disease as it occurs in Assam has been isolated by the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, from materials collected and sent from natural eases of infection in Assam. Transmission experiments done in Assam gave sufficient evidence that the disease can be reproduced in cattle and that goats are resistant thus confirming the observations in the actual field of outbreaks. Further work for determining the strain of the causative organism and evolving a vaccine for immunisation of healthy cattle against this fell disease has been engaging the attention of the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute. In the meantime amongst the various methods of curative treatment followed in Assam the one adopted lately with Novarsenobillon (N. A. B) through intravenous route appeared to be promising and more of the treatment is contemplated as opportunities may occur. These investigations and findings are of great scientific and economic importance as there is no denial that this disease has a great economic bearing upon the cattle wealth of our ryots. The following extract from an authenticated report will indicate the magnitude of loss suffered abroad from this one disease alone and nothing more eloquent need be cited to prove the seriousness of this disease.
14 "Contagious Pleuro Pneumonia had raged in former times in Great Britain with such severity that in I860 for instance 1,87,000 animals with a value of nineteen million pounds sterling fell victim to the disease". This disease in Assam has not only been rendering our ryots poorer in their cattle wealth but had a deterent effect upon agriculture and dairy industry. Besides, it has been striking at the very root of the cattle- breeding-operation in Assam in certain cattle breeding areas organised by the Agricultural Department proving once again that any attempt to improve agriculture and breed of cattle without first making adequate arrangement for prevention of scourge of diseases by strengthening the Veterinary Department is just like putting the cart before the horse. However the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, has very good reasons to feel happy for the result in respect of etiology and curative treatment of this fell disease which have been evolved as a result of persistent efforts during the last five years. I venture to say that this constitutes another landmark in the history of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam. I take this opportunity to acknowledge my indebtedness to the Director, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, for valuable service rendered by his Institute and for the advice and encouragement given by Mr. F. Ware, C. I. E., F. R. C. V. S., F. N. I., I.V.S., Animal Husbandry Commissioner with the Government of India. 67. As I reported last year the problem of Johne's disease in cattle in the Government Farms in particular and in the province in general has been engaging anxious thoughts and attention of the Civil Veterinary Department Assam and of the Government. Thus the Government has been exploring all possible means to control this disease with scientific advice not only given by the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, but also by such eminent Scientists as the Animal Husbandry Commissioner with the Government of India and the Director, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar. Government held a very important conference on this vexed question during the year under report over which the Hon'ble Prime Minister presided the Hon'ble Minister for Veterinary Department participating. It was extremely fortunate that we had the advantage of mature and valuable scientific advice in this conference from no less a personality than the highest Veterinary authority in India in the person of Mr. F. Ware, C. I. E., F. R. C. V. S., F. N. T., I. V. S., the Animal Husbandry Commissioner with the Govern- ment of India. 68. A disease in birds which has a direct bearing upon public health has been detected in pigeons as a result of investigation undertaken in collabora- tion with the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, during the year under report. This is perhaps the first instance in the history of India where natural cases of Para-typhoid in pigeons due to Salmonella Typhimurium were detected. This organism is said to be responsible for causation of specific Gastro-Enteritis (Para-typhoid) in human beings. Very little attention has so far been paid to the pigeon disease the importance of which can hardly be minimised, if for nothing else, at least for the bearing it has on public health. As pigeons often constitute edible dishes for table purpose and the disease has a distinct and direct bearing upon public health this finding is most significant specially when it is known that even apparently healthy pigeons might serve as "carriers" of the disease. It would thus appear that isolation of this organism in pigeon in a natural outbreak with such an important bearing upon public health sets another mile-stone in the history of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam.
15 69. Milk as a dietary was never brought to so much prominence during the recent years. It has indeed taken root in the train of thoughts of the people. Infant mortality and some of the deficiency diseases can be traced to the quality and quantity of milk consumed. If we want to make our future generation healthy and efficient consumption of milk is essential. Similarly meat forms a part of Indian dishes more commonly now than it did in the past. It cannot therefore be too strongly emphasised that no effort should be spared to ensure that these two articles of diet are made available not only in quantity sufficient but also in quality wholesome and free from any infection. There cannot be two opinions that these two commodities should be scrupulously examined before they are allowed to be offered for sale for human consumption. None but a qualified Veterinary surgeon is better suited to carry out this responsibility. This has not only been recognised by the Public Health Commissioner with the Government of India but has also been specially stressed by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. 70. The Department took an active interest in and substantially contri- buted towards the success of the scheme of Rural Uplift work in the province. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeons did excellent work in the Rural Uplift centres by protecting cattle against the worst fell disease of cattle, to wit, Rinderpest, undertook mass castration of weedy bulls to exclude them from the field of breeding operation with a view to improve the breed of cattle and as occasion arose rendered requisite veterinary aid to sick animals. Besides these they also impressed the stock owners on the general welfare of cattle particularly with reference to prevention of epidemic diseases and improve- ment of breed and feed of cattle. Myself and my circle Inspectors visited such centres as often as possible where we tried to infuse the spirit of service, co-operation and self-help. 71. The undesirable effect of the dual control of the Department conti- nues. Instances can be cite where administratoin had to be relegated to the back ground to satisfy personal consideration, where policy and working of the Department had been unnecessarily encroached upon and interfered with, where the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons had to harp under difficulties to carry on responsible duty imposed upon them, where personal interest was brought to play superior to public interest for which the veterinary service, nay any service, stands so that harmony is lacking and discipline withering. 1 am afraid that the contagion may spread unless treated in right time. If we do not mean to give efficient administration a good-bye. measures to remedy this should be considered with as little delay as possible. It is to be regretted that appeal as embodied in the Government Resolution No. 752-E., dated the 28th March 1941 had so far produced little effect. I would therefore suggest With all the emphasis I can command that the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, should be entirely provincialised on the same principle as it has been in the case of other nation-building departments such as agriculture, Industry, Co-operative, etc. 72. As I remarked once before Assam offers an excellent opportunity for investigation of animal diseases. This has proved to be true. It is ex- tremely fortunate that I have got so ardent and zealous a Veterinary Investi- tigation Officer in the person of Mr. V. R. Gopalakrishnan. He has been discharging his responsibilites with that loyal devotion to duty which has impressed me very much. My thanks arc due to him for his ever-abiding readiness to carry out any instruction given to him and successful prosecu- tion of his work. Now that an Animal Nutrition Officer has been appointed for Assam and has already commenced his work how very much I wished
16 that this officer and my Veterinary Investigation Officer could constantly remain in touch and actively co-operate with each other as animal nutrition and animal diseases are intimately connected and the one is correlated with the other. As a matter of fact I personally consider that these two schemes should have worked under the administrative control of a single head of the Department. 73. I would urge once more for the oft repeated proposal of entertain- ment of one Deputy Director in the Veterinary Department. The Depart- ment has passed its infancy and expanded to more than double of its original strength and activities with many complexities the burden of which the Director can no more bear alone. If the efficiency of the Department is to be maintained, if the Director is to be given any opportunity to think on greater scientific and administrative matters the appointment of a Deputy Director to relieve the former from routine nature of work cannot and should not be clayed a moment more so that higher and original scientific and administrative matters might receive his due and better attention. 74. The Hon'ble Minister in-charge of Agriculture and Veterinary Departments, Assam, paid a visit to my office and Laboratory at Gauhati. Our Institutes at Gauhati had the privilege of a second visit from the Hon'- ble Minister when no less an august personality than the Hon'ble Minister of Agriculture, Bengal was also pleased to pay a visit and enquire about the working of the Department in Assam. The Department considers it not only a great honour done to it by such visits but also values it immensely as a great encouragement to the staff. 75. The Veterinary Institutes and Laboratory and Veterinary Investi- gation Officer's office at Gauhati were visited by Mr. F. Ware, c.i.e., f.r.c.v.s., f.n.i., i.V.S., Animal Husbandry Commissioner with the Govern- ment of India during the year under report. He felt a very keen interest in the work done in Assam and was pleased to discuss at length many scien- tific matters of importance. His advice on the spot touching several impor- tant scientific matters was of immense value. This was particularly so in respect of Bovine Contagious Pleuro-Pneumonia which has been causing great anxiety to the Department and considerable economic loss to the province. My Veterinary Investigation Officer and myself very much appreciated his advice on the line of action to be taken in future research and investigation of animal diseases in Assam. The value and importance of such a visit from the head of the veterinary affairs in India cannot be too strongly emphasised and I am extremely grateful that though we are in the extreme north-eastern corner of India I had the privilege of a third visit from him in less than six years to the great benefit of my Department and of the province. 76. My technical staff showed once more their zeal and loyal devotion to duty. The appointment of 60 Veterinary Field Assistants to assist the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons has given considerable relief to the latter in ordinary routine work of inoculation and vaccination, and in the matter of castration by Burdizzio's castrator which has afforded the Veterinary Assist- ant Surgeons better scope to carry out work requiring scientific skill and knowledge. My Inspectors and Mr. Bhudhar Chandra Chatterjee, Johnes Disease Officer, Assam, did as much and as best possible under limitations. Inspector Babu Annada Mohan Das retired on well earned pension towards the close of the year. In his retirement the Department has lost the services of a senior and experienced officer. I take this opportunity to place on record the long and meritorious service he rendered to the Department for
17 long 32 years. I also take this opportunity to repeat my appreciation of service which my office staff rendered under the able guidance and super vision of my Head Clerk, Maulavi Muhammad Eunus. 77. My thanks are due to the District and Sub-Divisional Officers and to the Chairmen of Local Boards for their co-operation. My thanks arc also due to the Director, Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, for assistance he rendered me and my Department in supplying Goat-Tissue-Vaccine which was very extensively used and indented from Veterinary Vaccine Section under his control during the year under report.

Ware, Animal Husbandry Commissioner with the Government of India who attended a Conference on Johne's disease and furnished advice on several scientific matters. Some Local Boards again gave cause for adverse comments in connection with veterinary matters and the Director of Veterinary Department has again dwelt upon the undesirable effect of the dual control of the Veterinary Staff on the effi- ciency of the administration and emphasized the desir- ability of entirely provincialising the Department like other Departments. The Government congratulate Rai Sahib S. C. Ghosh, Director, Veterinary Department who has since retired on superannuation after short extension of service, on the growing popularity and activities of the Department and thank him for his interesting report.

Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, for the year 1945-46 Preface2 office of the Veterinary Investigation Officer, Assam, throughout the year under report except for a period on leave on average pay from the 16th July to the 15th September 1945. During the period of leave of Rao Sahib V. R. Gopalakrishnan, U. Nobindra, Assistant Investigation Officer (Poultry), Assam, officiated in his place. During the period Rao Sahib Gopalakrishnan was on tour for 143 days and travelled 6,487 miles by rail, 1,602 by road and 35 miles by boat. He has also visited 39 villages, 4 Tea Estates, 2 Government Farms and 2 Jail Dairies and 2 private farms in connection with his carriying out survey and investigation of animal disease condition in the province. He attended the 33rd session of the Indian Science Congress Association at Bangalore and read a paper entitled "A preliminary note on vaccination against Bovine Contagious Pleuro-pneumonia in Assam" He also attended the conference of the Veterinary Investigation Officers and Assistant Veterinary Inves- tigation Officers at the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar. He also helped the Army Veterinary Officers of the Defence Forces in the province in professional matters relating to investigation and control of diseases. The following diseases were investigated by Rao Sahib V. R. Gopalakrishnan :3 Veterinary Instructions 8. During the year there were 12 Assam Government stipendiaries in all in the Bengal Veterinary College, Calcutta against 9 of the preceding year and they were distributed as follows:4 17. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.5 Preventive inoculation and vaccination 33. Table II shows number and results of preventive inoculation and vaccina- tion undertaken during the year. It needs hardly any mention that the Depart- ment directed its energy to its utmost capacity to prophylactic inoculation of cattle against Rinderpest which is the main concern and the work therefrom mainly consisted of vaccination of cattle with the Goat Tissue Vaccine which was extensively under-taken. 34. Rinderpest6 Itinerating Veterinary Assistant Surgeons' work 44. Table IV.7 (4) Babu Annada Prasanna Das held the charge of the Upper Assam Circle. The following dispensaries were inspected by him. Veterinary dispensaries at Dhakuakhana, Jorhat, North Lakhimpur and Golaghat. Scientific and Other Important Work 51. The department continued its usual normal activities. Besides that research and investigations were done on the following pathological condition amongst other things. (1) Research and investigation into a pathological condition in cattle Simula ting Bovine Contagious Pleuro-pneumonia. (2) Investigation into pathological condition in sheep clinically simulating Rinderpest in cattle. (3) Investigation into poultry diseases, viz., Ranikhet Salmonellosis and Bacillary white diarrhoea, Fowl pox, Fowl cholera, Spirochaetosis, Avian Tuberculosis and Helminthiasis. (4) Investigation into Kumri in horses. (5) Investigation into Johne's disease. Part V8 Due to war there was a large influx of British and American troops in this Province and also Indian soilders from other parts of India. The livestock of this Province had been collected to provide a part of the diet of them. Therefore a great responsibility has devolved upon the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, for the improvement of the Livestock of the Province. Though there is a separate Department of Livestock in this Province under the Agriculture Department for the welfare of the cattle by their breeding and feeding the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, has also got no less responsibility for them as it has to look after the health and treatment of the animals. Civil Veterinary Department with its limited staff and resources rendered invaluable service to the Livestock of this Province. In many other Provinces in India Livestock and Veterinary Depart- ment have been combined and formed into an Animal Husbandry Department under the Veterinary control and the combined Department has been rendering yeomen service to the dumb cattle population of the Provinces. Though the Veterinary and the Livestock Department, are not amalgamated in this Province on account of various obstacles, such as shortage of staff, etc., it can be easily foreseen that in no distant time this obstacle can be easily surmounted, and the combined Department can be formed. The combined Department will be able to give valuable service to the cattle population of the poor Ryots, to most of whom, a pair of Bullocks is the sole capital property. 55. The Department is short of staff. The Goat Tissue Vaccine which is essentially required for the protection of cattle amongest Rinderpest, had to be brought from outside provinces, such as Bengal, etc. On some occasions they could not supply the quantity of vaccine actually required by us after meeting their own demands. Rinderpest serum which also may be used as a substitute for Goat Tissue Vaccine and which is indented for from the Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar could not be procured according to the need owing to dislocation in Railway Service at times, perhaps, due to want of waggons. It is Rinderpest alone which is the greatest enemy of the cattle population and which alone is responsible for the heavy toll of deaths of the cattle population of the Province and thus for making the helpless Ryots to be more helpless and +victim to Mohajons (money lenders). There are no laws regulating the move- ment of cattle in epidemic areas. The ignorant mass people do not co-operate with the Veterinary staff as they should do in their work. Thus though the Veterinary aid has been subject to a great handicap the Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, Assam, became successful in surmounting the difficulties and rendering great service to the people of the Province. 56. The mass people are understanding day by day the utility of Veterinary aid, which is evident from the reports of the Veterinary staff, as well as from the requisition for Veterinary Dispensaries and Hospitals from all parts of the Province9 insidence of diseases has been noticed in all seasons of the year. During the year there were outbreaks of this disease in the districts of Kamrup, Sibsagar, Naga Hills and Sylhet. As the disease has got every chance of being spread over the whole Province its control at this stage is very essential. A scheme for the control of this Bovine Contagious Pleuro Pneumonia in Assam was submitted to the Indian Council of Agriculture Research and it has been sanctioned by them with effect from the 1st April, 1946. 59. The problem of Johne's Disease amongst cattle in the Province and particularly in Government Farms has been also engaging the serious attention of the Department The control measures adopted in farms according to the recommendations of the Wars committee had reduced the incidence of the disease there and eliminated the possibility of its spread. According to a proposal of the Minett Committee, 1940 Mr. M. L. Sahoi, Research Officer, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, paid a visit to Assam in February, 1944, investi- gated the incidence of Johne's Disease in the Province, and tested the farm cattle. After his test with Jonin and Tuberculin he had suggested for a second test according to which Dr. P. C. Nag, Assistant Research Officer, Tuberculosis and Johne's Disease Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, visited Assam and carried our the test of Government cattle once more. The results of the test have not been received. During the year my Veterinary Investigation officer Rao Sahib V. R. Gopalakrishan, g. m. v c., p. g. (Mukteswar) investigated the disease and as a result of his investigation eight cases manifesting clinical symptoms of Johne's Disease were detected and confirmed by microscopical Exa- mination of faecal material obtained by bowel washing and of scraping from mucosa of posterior bowel in the Bappapang Farm, Digboi, the Government Cattle Breeding Farm, Khanapara, Larsing Tea Estate, Cachar District and Government Cattle Breeding Farm, Jorhat. 60. During the year under review Mr. A. Rahman b.a., g.b.sc., p.g., (Mukteswar), Assistant Investigation Officer, Poultry Disease had rendered inva- luable service by investigating Poultry diseases such as Ranikhet Disease, Fowl Pox, Fowl Cholera, etc. By his timely action the outbreak of the Poultry diseases in Government Farms at Khanapara and Shillong had subsided. He had visited many other localities of the Province, and tried to advise the interested villagers and private farmers how to construct cheap houses for Poultry, work out balanced rations from the grains available locally to feed their birds, and had advised the methods of controlling diseases in face of epidemics and precautions to be adopted in absence of it. It is noticed that Poultry keeping is a very good and substantial means of livelihood for the poor Ryots of the Province. More Poultry Diseases Officers are necessary to educate the Ryots as to keeping of their Poultry and also for rendering help to the diseased ones and thus saving them from heavy loss. 61. As I have stated this Department was bringing vaccine and serum from outside this Province and had a contemplation of having vaccine section of its own where the vaccine can be prepared according to it demand. It had also been thinking of the expansion of the Department by an increase of Veterinary personnels, Veterinary Dispensaries and Hospitals through- out the Province. The present staff of about 150 of the Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, Assam, is quite in-adequate to deal with about 127 lacs of livestock of this Province (cattle, goats, and sheep) acoording to 1945 cattle census report. According to this the Department was in need of at least 425 Veterinary Assis- tant Surgeons and 780 Veterinary Field Assistants for dealing with the whole cattle population of the Province. 62. Owing to the Financial difficulties I had not submitted many schemes for such development though I had a strong mind to do so. At this stage this province got a huge sum of money from the Government of India in connection with Post- war Development work and I, in order to fulfill my projects had submitted many
10 schemes to the Government for their consideration. Among these schemes the scheme for the establishment of Veterinary Vaccine Section in Assam and Veteri- nary Hospitals in the district headquarters and appointment of two (2) Deputy Directors are most important. In this connection, I would like to impress upon the Government that the Director, Veterinary Department, Assam, is perhaps the only Head of the Department in India who has been working single-handed without any Officers of the Gazetted rank, such as Deputy Director, Assistant Director, etc., to help him for smooth running of the Administration of the Department. I had on several occasions moved the Government for their assis- tance in this respect but unfortunately I was not favoured with it. 63. It would be unfair not to acknowledge the services of the Veterinary staff as a whole for their enthusiastic contribution and willingness to shoulder additional burdens to present a healthier season. A mention must also be made for the good work of my Inspectors who did everything for furtherance of the cause for which they were employed. I should like to record the valuable services put in by Rao Sahib V. R. Gopalakrishnan, Veterinary Investigation Officer, Assam, and Mr. A. Rahman, Assistant Investigation Officer (Poultry). I wish to record my appreciation of service which my office under the supervision of my Head Assistant Babu Satya Bhusan Sen and Officiating Head Assistant Babu Akshay Kumar Deb, b.a. rendered. 64. My thanks are due to the Commissioner of Divisions, Deputy Commissio- ners, Subdivisional Officers, Chairmen, Local Boards for assistance they have rendered me. My sincere thanks are also due to the Ryots of the Province whom I had met and who had given me their active co-operation. I must also thank the Animal Husbandry Commissioner with the Government of India and the Director, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, for their co-operation and help. My thanks are also due to the Director, Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal for the assistance he had given to this Department, through his Veterinary Vaccine section though at times the demand for vaccine was great. I also mention the name of Mr. Woodford, Director of Agriculture Assam, for the assistance he had rendered me and my staff in carrying out Veterinary work in the Government Farms under his control.

Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, for the year 1946-47 Preface2 He attended the seventh meeting of the Animal Husbandry Wing of the Board of Agricultural and Animal Husbandry in India, Lucknow, from the 16th to 20th December, 1946. In the 1st week of January, 1947 he attended the 34th Session of the Indian Science Congress Association held at Delhi and presented a paper entitled "Rinderpest among sheep and Goats in Assam" in the meeting of the section of Medical and Veterinary Sciences. Major G. Williamson, O.B.E., M.R.C.V.S., D.V.S.M., Animal Husbandry Commis- sioner with the Government of India, visited the Office and Laboratory of the Veterinary Investigation Officer, Assam, on the 8th April, 1946. The Hon'ble Minister for Agriculture and Veterinary Departments, Government of Assam accompanied by me paid a visit to Veterinary Investigation Officer's office on the 13th Deccmber,1946. I directed Rao Sahib V. R. Gopalakrishan, Veterinary Investigation Officer, Assam, to accompany and help Mr. V. R. Raja Gopalan, Research Officer, Tuber- culosis and Johne's desease, Indian, Veterinary Reseach Institute, Mulueswar, when he paid a visit to Assam in January, 1947 to investigate the incidence of Johne's disease in the Province and to test the cattle in the Government Farms. The following diseases were investigated by Rao Sahib V. R. Gopalakri- ahnan:3 Mr. A. Rahman, B. A., G. B. V. C, P. G. (Mukteswar), Assistant Veterinary Investigation Officer (Poultry), Assam, travelled 1,565 miles by train, 3,378 miles by road, and remained on tour for 133 days and visited 105 villages and Poultry Farms during the course of invesigation. The following Diseases were investigated by him during the period. (1) Ranikhet disease. (2) Helminthiasis. (3) Avian Tuberculosis. (4) Clinical Nutritional Survey. (5) Fowl Pox. (6) Salmonellosis in Ducks. (7) Survey of contagious diseases of Poultry. A detailed report on the work of the Assistant Veterinary Investigation Officer (Poultry), Assam, for the year 1946-47 had already been submitted to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research through the Local Government as usual. Veterinary Instructions 8. During the year under report there were in all 13 Assam Government stipendiaries in Bengal and Bombay Veterinary Colleges against 12 in Bengal Veterinary College of the previous year and they were distributed as follows:4 12. Dourine.5 Preventive inoculation and Vaccination 33. Table II shows the number and result of preventive inoculation and vaccination undertaken during the year. The Rinderpest is the most dangerous and fatal disease and it causes a large number of cattle death in every year. This Department devoted its utmost energy to prophylactic inoculation and vaccina- tion with the Goat Tissue Vaccine. 34. Renderpest.6 42. Silchar Veterinary Hospital.7 Scientific and other important work 51. The Department continued its usual normal activities. Due to the Post-War Schemes the value of work much increased. Besides this Research and investigations were done on the following Pathological condition amongst other things. 1. Research and investigation into a Pathological condition in cattle simula- ting Bovine Contagious Pleuro-Pneumonia. 2. Clinical survey and investigations of animal diseases of probable nutri- tional origin. 3. Preliminary survey of Bovine haematuria. 4. Investigation into Johne's disease. 5. Investigation and clinical observation of the skin lesions of ear-sore in buffaloes in winter and summer seasons were continued. 6. Investigation into Bovine Contagious abortion. 7. Investigation into Poultry Diseases 'viz.,8 been rendering yeomen services to the dumb cattle population. In Assam there is a separate Section of livestock under the Agriculture Department for the welfare of the cattle, their breeding and feeding. The Veterinary Department has to look after the health and treatment of the animals. Though I have a contemplation for submission of a scheme for combining the Veterinary Depart- ment and Livestock Section into one Department under Veterinary control for some reasons, such as shortage of technical staff, etc. I have to keep it postponed for a deferred date. However I would expect that in near future these two will be combined into one Department and be able to render invaluable service to the cattle population of the Ryots. 55. The Rinderpest disease is the most fatal disease in Assam which is a cause for the loss of thousand of cattle every year. The Goat Tissue Vaccine which is the most preventive medicine for this disease is essentially required for combating it. But this Department has got no Vaccine Depot of its own so that it may produce Goat Tissue Vaccine here. This Department has to indent for Goat Tissue Vaccine from outside the Province such as from Bengal. But on some occasions that Province also could not supply the quantity required by us after meeting their own demands. The Rinderpest Serum which also may be used as a substitute for Goat Tissue Vaccine and which is indented for from Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, could not be procured according to the need owing to dislocation of traffic at times Thus when other medicines were not available at all the staff of this Department were supplied with M & B 693 (Veterinary) to deal with Rinderpest epidemic as this drug being powerful anti- septic and has got action upon secondary invaders but has got no curative value in Rinderpest. But this medicine is a costly one and only to save the emergent situation this was used with some good result. There is no law regulating the movement of cattle in and from disease9 due to unrestricted movement of cattle from one place to another in the Province. The incidence of this disease has been noticed in all seasons of the year. As the disease has got every chance of being spread over the whole Province its control at this stage is very essential. Accordingly a scheme for the control of Bovine Contagious Pleuro-Pneumonia was submitted to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and it has been sanctioned this year. But due to shortage of technical staff it has not yet been given effect to. As soon as technical men even from outside the Province will be available the scheme will be materialised. 59. The problem of Johne's Disease amongst cattle in the Province and particularly in Government Farms has been also engaging the serious attention of the Department. During the year under report Mr. V. R. Rajagopalan, Research Officer, T. B. and Johne's Disease, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, visited Assam to test cattle in Government Farms. My Veterinary Investigation Officer, Assam, Rao Sahib V. R. Gopalakrishnan helped him in his research work in the Government Farm; while visiting the. Upper Shillong Farm they found two Farm sheep suspected for Johne's disease on clinical basis. Postmortem examination was conducted and the lesions in both of them were indicative of the infection. But the smears from the thickened portions of the intestines and the enlarged and oedematous mesenteric lymphatic glands, were negative for acid fast organisms. However, material was collected for cultural examination and histopathological study by the Research Officer. During the year under report my Veterinary Investigation Officer Rao Sahib V. R. Gopalakrishnan investigated the disease and as a result of his investigation four cases manifesting clinical symptoms of Johne's disease, were detected and confirmed by microscopical examination of feacal material obtained by bowel washing and of scrapings from musa of posterior bowels. In all cases of confirmation of disease, control measures were suggested to check the further spread of infections. Examination of material from local cattle outside the Government Farms, proved negative for the disease. 60. During the year under report Mr. A. Rahman, B.A., G.V.Sc, P.G., Mukteswar, Assistant Investigation Officer, (Poultry) diseases, Assam, had rendered valuable service by investigating Poultry diseases such as Ranikhet disease, Fowl-Pox, Fowl Cholera, etc. But no extensive investigation of all the items under the technical programme could be undertaken owing to his absence from the headquarters from the 8th October, 1946 to the end of March 1947 for undergoing a training at Izatnagar. Among the poultry disease Ranikhet is the most fatal disease in Assam causing a heavy toll of lives of poultry of the poor cultivators of the Province. Assam, has got no Ranikhet Vaccine Depot of its own and has to depend upon Bengal to meet its demand. But Bengal cannot supply the required quantities. I have seriously taken account of this and have decided to submit a scheme for the establishment of a Ranikhet Vaccine Depot to the Government for their approval. 61. I have already stated that this Department has to indent Goat Tissue Vaccine from Bengal, Bihar, etc., and without a Vaccine Section of its own the Province cannot be self supported and at times cannot cope with Rinderpest epidemic. Hence I found it necessary to establish a Vaccine Section of cur own Department, Gauhati, where Vaccine can easily be prepared according to the demand. Accordingly I paid a visit to the Bengal Veterinary Vaccine Section, Calcutta, in August, 1946. I had submitted a detailed scheme to the Local Government for approval. The present Veterinary staff of the Province is quite inadequate to deal with about 127 lacs of livestock of the Province according to 1945, Cattle Census Report. According to this the Department was in need of at least 425 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, and 780 Veterinary Field Assistants for dealing with the whole cattle population of the Province. I have paid my. serious attention to get more men trained in Veterinary Science In case sufficient number of seats are not available in Veterinary Colleges outside the
10 Province in India. I shall consider whether a Veterinary College can be establi- shed in this Province. 62. Owing to financial difficulties and shortage of technical staff I had not submitted many development schemes earlier though I had a strong desire to do so. However during the year many development schemes under Post-War Reconstruction work have been submitted to the Government for their sanction. In this connection I would like to impress upon the Government that the Director of Veterinary Department, Assam, is perhaps the only Head of the Department in India who has been working single handed without any Gazetted Officer in the Department to help him for smooth running of the Administra- tion of the Department. 63. I am grateful to Rao Sahib V. R. Gopalakrishnan, Veterinary Investi- gation Officer, Assam, Mr. A. Rahman, Assistant Veterinary Investigation Officer (Poultry Diseases), Assam, and to the Veterinary Inspectors, Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and Veterinary Field Assistants for their enthusiastic contribution and willingness to shoulder additional burden to present a healthier season. I wish to record my appreciation of service which my Office had rendered besides manifold difficulties in the present abnormal time under the able guidance of the Head Assistant, Babu Akshay Kumar Deb, B.A. In this connection I would also impress upon the Government that though my Office staff is doing work which is as responsible and arduous as the work of the Office Assistants of the other Heads of Departments in respect of pay, etc., they are not treated like them; they are allowed salaries, etc., like those of the Assistants of district Offi- ces. This not only discourages them but also lowers the position of the Depart- ment to a great extent. 64. My thanks are due to the Commissioner of Division, Deputy Commis- sioners, Subdivisional Officers and the Chairman of the local and Municipal Boards of Assam for assistance they have renderd me. My sincere thanks are also due to the Ryots of the Province whom I had met and who had given me their active co-operation. I must also thank the Animal Husbandry Com- missioner with the Government of India and the Director of Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar for their co-operation and help. My thanks are also due to the Director of Veterinary Services, Bengal, for the assistance he had given to this Department. I also like to mention the name of Mr. Woodford, Director of Agriculture, Assam, for the assistance he had rendered me and to my staff in carrying out Veterinary work in the Government Farms under his control. Dated Shillong, the 12th December 1948. A. K. MITRA, Director of Veterinary Department, Assam.

9 due to unrestricted movement of cattle from one place to another in the Province. The incidence of this disease has been noticed in all seasons of the year. As the disease has got every chance of being spread over the whole Province its control at this stage is very essential. Accordingly a scheme for the control of Bovine Contagious Pleuro-Pneumonia was submitted to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and it has been sanctioned this year. But due to shortage of technical staff it has not yet been given effect to. As soon as technical men even from outside the Province will be available the scheme will be materialised. 59. The problem of Johne's Disease amongst cattle in the Province and particularly in Government Farms has been also engaging the serious attention of the Department. During the year under report Mr. V. R. Rajagopalan, Research Officer, T. B. and Johne's Disease, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, visited Assam to test cattle in Government Farms. My Veterinary Investigation Officer, Assam, Rao Sahib V. R. Gopalakrishnan helped him in his research work in the Government Farm; while visiting the Upper Shillong Farm they found two Farm sheep suspected for Johne's disease on clinical basis. Postmortem examination was conducted and the lesions in both of them were indicative of the infection. But the smears from the thickened portions of the intestines and the enlarged and oedematous mesentoric lymphatic glands, were negative for acid fast organisms. However, material was collected for cultural examination and histopathological study by the Research Officer. During the year under report my Veterinary Investigation Officer Rao Sahib V. R. Gopalakrishnan investigated the disease and as a result of his investigation four cases manifesting clinical symptoms of Johne's disease, were detected and confirmed by microscopical examination of feacal material obtained by bowel washing and of scrapings from inusa of posterior bowels. In all cases of confirmation of disease, control measures were suggested to check the further spread of infections. Examination of material from local cattle outside the Government Farms, proved negative for the disease. 60. During the year under report Mr. A. Rahman, B.A., G.V.Sc, P.G., Mukteswar, Assistant Investigation Officer, (Poultry) diseases, Assam, had rendered valuable service by investigating Poultry diseases such as Ranikhet disease, Fowl-Pox, Fowl Cholera, etc. But no extensive investigation of all the items under the technical programme could be undertaken owing to his absence from the headquarters from the 8th October, 1946 to the end of March 1947 for undergoing a training at Izatnagar. Among the poultry disease Ranikhet is the most fatal disease in Assam causing a heavy toll of lives of poultry of the poor cultivators of the Province. Assam, has got no Ranikhet Vaccine Depot of its own and has to depend upon Bengal to meet its demand. But Bengal cannot supply the required quantities. I have seriously taken account of this and have decided to submit a scheme for the establishment of a Ranikhet Vaccine Depot to the Government for their approval. 61. I have alrendy stated that this Department has to indent Goat Tissue Vaccine from Bengal, Bihar, etc., and without a Vaccine Section of its own the Province cannot be self supported and at times cannot cope with Rinderpest epidemic. Hence I found it necessary to establish a Vaccine Section of our own Department, Gauhati, where Vaccine can easily be prepared according to the demand. Accordingly I paid a visit to the Bengal Veterinary Vaccine Section, Calcutta, in August, 1946. I had submitted a detailed scheme to the Local Government for approval. The present Veterinary staff of the Province is quite inadequate to deal with about 127 lacs of livestock of the Province according to 1945, Cattle Census Report. According to this the Department was in need of at least 425 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, and 780 Veterinary Field Assistants for dealing with the whole cattle population of the Province. I have paid my. serious attention to get more men trained in Veterinary Science In case sufficient number of seats are not available in Veterinary Colleges outside the

ORDERS BY THE GOVERNOR Resolution on the Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam for the year 1946-47 Extracts from the proceedings of the Government of Assam in Agriculture Department No.AGV.10/49, dated the 18th June, 1949 READ:2 The scheme for the Investigation of Poultry diseases partly financed by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, was also in progress, during the year under review. The following diseases were investigated by the Assistant Investigation Officer (Poultry), Assam, during the period. (1) Ranikhet disease, (2) Helminthiasis, (3) Avian Tuberculosis, (4) Cli- nical Nutritional Survey, (5) Fowl Pox, (6) Salmonellosis in Ducks, (7) Sur- vey of Contagious diseases of Poultry. Like the previous years, the Department sent altogether thirteen stipen- diaries to the Bengal and Bombay Veterinary Colleges, for training in the Veterinary Science. It will appear from the figures stated below that the activities of the Veterinary Department has extended considerably and become more popular amongst villagers. It is also noted with great interest that consi- derable public co-operation has been obtained by the efforts of the Depart- ment to raise the standard of livestock of the Province. The total mortality of animals during the year under report from all causes was 57,409 against 41,732 of the previous year. Preventive inoculation and vaccination were undertaken in 404 outbreaks as against 1,024 outbreaks in the previous year, and 6,587 were reported to have died uninoculated in course of outbreaks. In these outbreaks 2,72,965 animals were vaccinated with Goat Tissue Vaccine and 2,836 were inoculated by serum method and 95 by sero-virus method. Out of these inoculated animals, only 831 were reported to have died during the year under review. The total number of animals treated in three Veterinary Hospitals (i.e. Gauhati, Shillong and Silchar) during the year under report was 8,372 against 7,420 in the previous year. During the year under report, the Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Sur- geons of the Department visited 21,555 villages in which they castrated 39,319 animals and treated 35,120 animals, suffering from contagious dise- ases, and 1,79,845 animals suffering from non-contagious diseases. During the year under review, two fairs and shows, in all, were ex- hibited by the Department. To be in such a position after the end of the year, gives much ground for hope for the future and there is good reason to believe that the Pro- vince will be in a flourishing condition at least in regard to its cattle popu- lation and livestock within a few years.

Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department Assam, for the year 1948-49 PREFACE2 The following diseases were met by Shri V. R, Gopalakrishnan :3 The following diseases were investigated by him4 11. Anthrax.5 inoculation was undertaken against Rinderpest in 429 outbreaks as against in 407 outbreaks in previous year. Five thousand five hundred and twenty animals died without any "Goat Tissue Vaccination" during the year under report against 11,483 animals in the previous year. In these outbreaks 1,18,720 animals were inoculated with Goat Tissue Vaccine, 35,390 animals Serum alone method while 16,423 animals were inoculated by simultaneous method. Out of 1,70,535 inoculated cattle 121 died of Rinderpest in the year under report as against 462 cattle who died in the previous year due to the same cause. 32. Anthrax.6 Assistant Surgeons and the Reserve Veterinary Assistant Surgeons while on tout- in their particular districts during the year. In all they visited 17,654 villages as against 19,247 villages in the previous year. During the year under report they castrated 19,222 animals and treated 30,711 animals for contagious diseases and 1,37,591 animals for non-contagious diseases making a total of 1,87,524 animals dealt with in the year under report. In previous year they castrated 23,206 animals and treated 24,643 animals for contagious diseases and 1,58,837 for non-contagious diseases making a total of 2,06,686 animals dealt with during that year. 43. Table V shows the number of castrations performed and cases treated, district by district. These figures have been worked out from the statements in Table III and Table IV. The figures of the live-stock population have been obtained from the reports of cattle census held in 1945. Part III7 (5) Investigation into Poultry diseases, viz., Ranikhet, Helminthiasis, etc. (6) Investigation into Surra. (7) Investigation of Bovine Lymphangitis. (8) Investigation of Bovine contagious-abortion. Part V8 (5) The scheme for the expansion of headquarters staff and entertainment of one Deputy Director of Veterinary Department, Assam.9 I held office of the Principal of the Assam Veterinary College from 20th September 1948. I represented the Veterinary Department, Assam in the 36th session of the India Science Congress held at Allahabad and in the 8tb Meeting of the Animal Husbandry Wing of the Board of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry in India held at Mysore and participated in the various delibera- ions. I manufactured the "Goat Tissue Vaccine" for the first time in the State with the help of the College staff and thus considerably reduced the heavy losses caused by the most fatal and devastating disease "Rinderpest". The students took up the "Mass Inoculation Campaign" during the summer vacation in the Nowgong District and inoculated more than one lac of animals against Rinderpest. The vaccine has not only alleviated the untold sufferings of the Cultivators but has brought about a huge economic loss to the State by considerably reducing the mortality of cattle population. The students of the College rendered invalu- able services to the Cultivators through their visits into the interior most of the villages in course of their practical training in the rural areas. The cultivators were thus enlightened and were greatly benefitted in the matter of animal management, disease control feeding and breeding of animals. The college staff actually participated in the flood relief work of the Nowgong District in 1948. It is interesting and heartening to note that the students and the staff of the College have won a great name amongst the cultivators through their selfless service devoted solely to the cause of livestock welfare. Great interest and appreciation were observed amongst the people about the Veterinary profession and its manifold activities. The teaching staff of the College discharged their duties well inspite of many difficulties. The ministrial staff also put in their best foot foremost in discharging their duties and did good work. The receipts and expenditure of the College is given in Appendix 'A'. Appendix 'A' Total receipt:10 the cattle population and combating the epidemic throughout the State. Inspite of this difficulty the activities of the Department extended considerably and became more popular amongst the people. The technical staff thus deserve, all credit and also encouragement in respect of pay, allowances and prospects as these of the graduates of the Agricultural Department. 55. The clerical staff of the Head office which was overworked due to the increasing activities of the Department discharged their duties, satisfactorily. They also deserve to get the benefit of pay and status similar to those in the offices of other Heads of Departments. G. K. MEHRA, Director of Veterinary Department, Assam.

The total number of animals treated in four Veterinary Hospital (i.e., Gauhati, Shillong, Silchar and Tezpur) during the year under report, were 11,197 against 9,36.7 in the previous year. During the year under review, the Itinerating Veterinary Assistant Surgeons of the Department visited 17,654 villages in which they castrated 19,222 animals ; and treated 30,711 animals suffering from contagious diseases and 1,37,591 animals for non-contagious diseases making a total of 1,87,524 animals dealt with in the year under report. During the year, there was only one fair. Besides this, the Department parti- cipated in several exhibitions on the general welfare of cattle and prevention of contagious diseases.
