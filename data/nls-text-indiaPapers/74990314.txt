SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit to His Grace the Governor in Council the Medical and Sanitary Report on the Native Army of Madras, for the year 1878. 2. Under instructions conveyed in G.O., No. 1,268, of 13th March 1878, new forms of weekly and annual sick returns were introduced, and this change, together with the movements of various regiments from one station to another and the absence of others on field service, has prevented some Medical Officers from being as punctual as usual in forwarding their annual reports. 3.

As regards men sent on sick leave the only causes showing increased ratios in 1878 are malarial fevers and skin diseases. 12. Health of individual regiments. 6 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT. the largest ratio of daily sick in 1878 are the 4th Light Cavalry quartered at Bellary, the 8th Regiment at Seetabuldee and Saugor, the 27th at Bellary, the 7th at Vizagapatam, the 23rd at the Andamans, the 16th at Raipore and Jubbulpore, the 41st at Toungoo and 28th at Mercara. As regards the 23rd Regiment the detachment at the Nicobars suffered severely, as usual, from malarial fever, and this complaint was also very prevalent at Port Blair. The disease was most common and severe during the heavy rains, and although the men are quartered in most comfortable barracks they are inevitably much exposed to wet. They were more- over in an enfeebled state on arrival at the station, from previous service in a famine district. Mercara is also a trying climate for the Madras sepoy owing to its cold climate and heavy rainfall, and the 28th Regiment there had a large amount of sickness, chiefly ague, dysentery and diarrhOF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. 7 Corps.

The movements of troops in the course of reliefs were generally carried out without much sickness, except in the case of the 29th Regiment, the head-quarters and wing of which suffered from cholera on the march from Secunderabad to Vizagapatam. The disease broke out when the troops were in the neighbourhood of Rajahmundry, and 5 deaths occurred amongst the men besides a large number amongst the families. The outbreak was attributed to unavoidable detention of the wing near a village in which cholera was prevailing. The expedition to Malta was planned and harried out on very brief notice, but the necessary medical arrange- ments were duly made and worked well. In addition to the ordinary establishment, the 25th Regiment was provided with 1 Surgeon and 1 Hospital Assistant extra, and a Medical Officer was also attached to the 2 Companies of Sappers. The troops for this expedition embarked in April. The 25th reached Malta on the 24th May and left it again for Cyprus on the 17th July. On the 15th August it re-embarked for India, and reached Madras viâ , Bombay on the 8th September. During these novements the men enjoyed good health. The G and H Companies of Sappers were also sent from Malta to Cyprus, but having been detained there for some time, during the unhealthy season, suffered much from the fever of the place. The Madras troops forming part of the Afghan expedition were also provided with. extra Medical Staff, and detailed instructions were issued to the Senior Medical *A detachment of volunteers joined the 25th Regiment proceeding to Malta.
8 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT Officers regarding their duties in the field. To meet the rigors of the northern winter, warm clothing was provided for the men generally, and also for the sick in hospital and followers. The medical stores were issued in light panniers, capable of being carried in sets of four by mules or pack-bullocks, or failing these means of transport by coolies. The contents of the panniers were carefully selected, the object being to make the equipment as light as possible and to restrict the supplies to articles absolutely necessary in actual warfare. The medical equipment of the Madras regiments was on the regimental system, but was so arranged, both as regards Medical Staff and Stores, that base hospitals could be organized, if found necessary, when in contact with the enemy. A good deal of correspondence ensued regarding medical store supplies, warm clothing, water-proof sheets, camp equipage, &c., but everything was satisfactorily arranged and the troops took the field provided with every necessary.

This sudden change of dress in a tired man must be attended with more or less risk even on the plains, and at elevated stations like Bangalore and Mercara and places in the north, subject to great and sudden changes of temper- ature, cannot fail to have a most prejudicial effect on the health of the men.

The huts of the 28th Native Infantry at Mercara have withstood another monsoon very well, and the addition of a fresh coat of thatch each year will make those of the left wing warmer and more comfortable. The east hutting lines at Bangalore, now occupied by the 4th Native Infantry, are, perhaps, with the exception of those of the 4th Cavalry, the least satisfactory in the whole administrative circle. Their defects, both of site and construction, have been mentioned in former reports. No progress has been made with the project for a new water-supply for Bangalore, and it seems to be at a complete stand-still. An attempt was made during this year to cut off one of the many sources of defilement to which the Ulsoor Tank water is exposed, but it was successfully opposed by the Mysore Govern- ment, partly on the plea that there were other and even greater sources of pollution of that water, and that, notwithstanding, the Official Analyst had some years ago reported it to be good. There are causes of disease, however, which the Analyst is powerless to discover, probably, because, in many instances, he destroys them in the search. The contagium of cholera has hitherto eluded the quest of the crucible, and malaria the microscope. It is therefore not safe to trust exclusively to analysis when other sources of information are open to us. The highest sanitary authority in India goes even further, and lays it down as a rule that it is superfluous to test a water the source of which is manifestly impure, and the water of the Ulsoor Tank is gathered from ground which is exposed to almost every kind of impurity, human and bestial, that civiliza- tion engenders.

The boarded floor of one of the wards in the regimental hospital at Mercara was taken up, and the space underneath cleaned, laid down with concrete, and ventilated. The necessity for this was pointed out in the last report. The hospital at Hunsur was overcrowded, although the Civil Dispensary had been removed from it to another building; but the space thus rendered available could not be utilized until shelves had been put up for the medicines and other stores that were kept in a portion of the main ward, partitioned off from that occupied by the sick. All the hospitals were lime-washed according to the regulations. Latrines .50 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. STATEMENT No II. Mysore Division. Stations. Corps.

It is probable that the eye-flies are a potent factor in the production and dissemination of these diseases. Wounds and accidents were fewer in Bangalore but more numerous in Bellary than in 1877. In the latter station the presence of a cavalry corps serves to keep up the admissions from this class. Fortunately none of these proved fatal. Rheumatism was more prevalent at the French Rocks and Bellary than at Bangalore or Mercara. This disease was less prevalent in every station last year than in 1877. The damp climate of Mercara only contributed 7 cases, while the French Rocks, with a nearly similar strength, produced 21. Six cases of phthisis pulmonalis occurred, all of which were at Bangalore, and 3 of them proved fatal. Respiratory diseases were more prevalent this year at Bangalore, but less so at Bellary and Mercara than in 1877. They were nearly the same at the French Rocks. In the Bangalore force the Sappers seem to suffer more than any other corps from this class of disease. Of hepatitis only 3 cases occurred and they were all in Bangalore. Of abscesses and ulcers 122 cases were admitted against 118 last year, though there were then 21 cases at Kurnool alone. Mercara seems to be especially obnoxious to these diseases, as many as 54.06 per 1,000 having been attacked; the damp climate is doubtless the cause. STATEMENT No. VII. Invaliding. Diseases.

During the heavy rains many of the huts fell and have been renewed. The lines of the Sappers are not well situated as they have to the west a large tank and swampy paddy-fields. The floors of the huts are very low, and during the rains the walls of a great many huts fell. The drains about the lines are better than in any of other Native corps, for the skill of the Sappers has been usefully employed to build and keep them in order. The ventilation and construction of the huts are much the same in all lines, those of most modern date being somewhat larger and more uniform; the number of openings for ventilation depends much on the ideas of the occupant: some huts have only the doors and the open spaces about the roof for the admission of air, whilst others have small windows or openings made in the front and back walls. The public latrines of the regiments are carefully attended to by the use of dry earth and coal-tar. They have been built by the Municipality in the vicinity of regiments and are fairly resorted to by both males and females of lower castes. The better class of females and their families use private latrines in their small compounds, and these are kept in order by daily conservancy, and the constant inspection of the lines checks any nuisance being permitted to occur from neglect on the part of the occupants of the huts. Hospitals.74 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. drains are swept daily and existing covered drains are cleared, opened and repaired under the orders of the Magistrate and Assistant Quartermaster-General, Hyderabad Subsidiary Force. There are patches of wet cultivation and several small tanks in the cantonment, and they become marshes as they dry up; proposals have been submitted for improving the general conditions of the water-shed in which they occur, and there are no great engineering difficulties in the way. The drainage of the town of Secunderabad is a much more extensive undertaking, as a great part of the drainage runs into the Hussain Saugar Tank. It would be very difficult and costly to divert this drainage, so that it may be taken round the tank and provided with an outfall below the tank bund, as the town is built on either side of a nullah which runs into the tanks, and most of the town drainage naturally flows into this nullah. To give some idea of the levels of the ground which would have to be dealt with in diverting the drainage, it may be mentioned that the level of the waste weir of the tank is the same as that of the bed of the nullah (or town drain) at a point several hundred yards within the town on the side next the tank, i.e., now that the tank is as full as it can hold, the water of the tank extends some distance up the town drain within the town. A large number of public latrines are erected in various parts of the town and cantonment, and they are effectually cleansed by a suitable staff of scavengers, and it is reported there are 3,500 houses with private latrines which are carefully attended to by the conservancy department under municipal rules. The conservancy of the station generally is very fairly executed, and the streets and roads rarely present any defects to indicate neglect. In consequence of the very heavy fall of rain many of the compounds of unoccupied houses became much overgrown with rank vegetation, and some more active supervision regarding them would have been advantageous.

Surgeon-Major Rean, M.D., in his remarks on giving over charge of the Lock Hospital, states, "It is noticed that if a registered female absents herself for some weeks and she is brought up for examination, she has generally contracted disease, her non-attendance being due to the consciousness that she would be detained in hospital, and these facts point to the necessity of the detective agency being particularly active in bringing up all prostitutes who absent themselves from the regular examinations." Although the admissions of European troops have increased, yet on analyzing the table (vide above) there is reason to hope that the working of the Contagious Diseases Act has not been inoperative, and that a fair amount of success has been obtained, for the number of admissions from secondary syphilis are very much reduced, and it is this affection especially which so undermines the constitution of the soldier, and not the simple primary soft sore which appears to be yearly becoming the predominating infecting virus in parts where lock hospitals are established. This table shows the admissions in this force for secondary syphilis during the past five years:HYDERABAD SUBSIDIARY FORCE. 81 " I may premise by stating that I only held medical charge of the companies for about six weeks, from 18th November to 31st December 1878. " The chief cause I think is to be found in the insalubrity of the lines, for on inspection of the men by my predecessor about 75 per cent. of them were found to be suffering from anæmia, ague, and enlarged spleen, and they were consequently reported unfit for duty. The heavy and continuous rain and the defective construction of the huts told with even greater severity on the families of the men than upon themselves. " Despite the improved circumstances as regards housing, dieting, and medical treatment under which the men were when in hospital, 8 of them succumbed. " Their wives and children, without these aids to recovery, suffered in much larger proportion. " The defects in the men's huts have been noticed in previous annual reports, and I believe the Public Works Department are surveying and inspecting the lines at present in view to carrying out improvements. When the lines are rendered more healthy by drainage and better construction of huts, it is believed the death-rate may be reduced." I have already expressed my opinion that the lines are unhealthily situated, and as the drainage and construction of the huts is much the same in all the Native lines, I think that bad position is one of the chief causes, and possibly the habits and castes of the Sappers is another. Further information obtained from all stations where Sappers are stationed may throw additional light on this subject. The death-rates among the other corps are high, and may be put down to the unusual inclemency of the year. European Commissioned Officers. 82 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS.

Ventilation and drainage for the men's barrack-rooms, huts, &c.BRITISH BURMAH DIVISION. 109 This state seems to have been brought about in many cases through a defective supply of sufficiently nutritive food, and to have resulted in other instances from repeated attacks of fever and dysentery. Syphilis has prevailed to a great extent and been the cause of a considerable amount of invaliding. The large number of new recruits in the regiment, of course, tends to augment the number of admissions under this head. The general sanitation of the barracks and hospital has been on the whole very good. The most urgently required remedial measures are the building of a new hospital and more suitable barrack latrines. Deputy Surgeon-General H. R. Oswald, M.D., inspected this corps on the 2nd December 1878 and reports as follows:110 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. Climate of the station.

On the whole the health of the regiment was satisfactory, and the mortality was less than in the preceding year when 8 men died in hospital and two out of it. Four sepoys succumbed to cholera in January whilst the regiment was stationed at Trichinopoly; a naigue died at Kamptee where he had gone on sick leave; a sepoy fell a victim at Rangoon (where he had been sent from here for disposal) to diabetis; and two men died here from general debility followed by general dropsy. The health of the regiment does not appear to have deteriorated since arrival (in March) in Burmah, but it is probably too soon yet to form onclusion on this point. Deputy Surgeon-General H. R.

None of these eases proved fatal. Including followers there were 11 admissions and 7 deaths from cholera at the camp, which shows that the disease was virulent. The immediate cause of cholera could not well be determined, but there was no doubt that some of the patients attacked had been eating a short time previously badly-boiled rice and some unwholesome vegetables.
