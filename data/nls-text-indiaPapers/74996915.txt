No. 641. FROM J. FULLARTON BEATSON, ESQ., M.D., C.I.E., Surgeon-General, Indian Medical Department, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, MILITARY DEPARTMENT. Fort William, the 19th August 1878. SIR, I HAVE the honor to forward, for submission to the Right Hon'ble the Governor General in Council, the Medical and Sanitary Report of the Native Army in the Bengal Presidency for the year 1877 (forming the tenth of the series), which has been compiled, under my supervision; by my Secretary, Surgeon-Major K. McLeod, M.D. 2. I am gratified that I am this year able to report that a considerable improvement has taken place in the punctuality and accuracy with which Medical Officers have submitted their reports and returns for the year under review. This, together with the great relief which I have experienced in being freed of the burden of the medical administration of the Province of Bengal, has enabled me to prepare and submit this Report sooner than has hitherto been found possible. I anticipate that this improvement will be not only sustained, but may even be surpassed in future years. Greater punctuality in submission of reports. STATEMENT No. I.

The strength of the Native Army and of its different sections is shown in Statement No.1 The figures represent averages for the year, founded for the most part on daily census. They may, therefore, be accepted as being as accurate as it is possible to obtain; and, with regard to these and all the statistical returns presented in this Report, I may state that they have been subjected to a most systematic and searching scrutiny, by a detailed and thorough comparison of the en- tries made in the annual returns with those of the weekly returns, which were carefully tabulated for that purpose. The figures are, therefore, as perfect representatives of the facts which they are intended to represent as figures can be "Present" strength is, as usual, to be understood to indicate the strength Strength of the Native Army.

As compared with the preceding year, the figures representing the total strength of the Regular Army, the Central India Force, and the Punjab Frontier Force present a remarkable similarity. They also agree relatively as regards the proportions of absentees, but the figures for 1877 exhibit a lower range; the percentage of "absent" strength being in the case of the Regular Army 11.8 against 12.3, in the Central India Force 20.4 against 21.2, and in the Punjab Frontier Force 16.6 against 17.1. The Madras troops, consisting of one Cavalry and four Infantry regiments, also present very similar figures; the proportion of absentees being again conspicuously small. The regiments are the same as were included in last year's returns; the only change of consequence being the removal of the 11th Infantry from Nagode to Dorunda, where it is now stationed.

While the strength of the Native Army of Bengal (excluding Madras troops) averaged 62,794 for the year, the number on the rolls on the first day of January was 62,685, and on the 31st of December 63,061. There was thus a net increase of 376 men during the year. The additions to the Army by recruit- ing amounted to 5,536, and the permanent loss to 5,160, the difference between these numbers accounting for the gain of strength. The gain represents a proportion of 8.81 per cent. of average strength, against 9.02, 9.61, and 11.02 in the years 1876, 1875 and 1874; and the loss of 8.22, against 9.24, 9.76 and 10.35 in the same years. Of the 5,160 men who were removed from the rolls from various causes, 1,594, or 30.9 per cent., were invalided; 1,519, or 29.4, were discharged by commanding officers at their own request; 578, or 11.2, removed for physical disability; 622, or 12.1, for misconduct, &c.; and 847, or 16.4, died. The relations which these events bore to the average strength of the Army are shown in the accom- panying statement, as compared with the three preceding years. The year under report pre- sents lower rates under every head than its pre- decessor; and it is only in the item of deaths, and that to a very tri- fling extent, that any one of the figures ren- dered by 1877 exceeds any one of those of any of the three previous years. Statistical importance of fluctuation. The fluctuations which a body of men undergoes within a given period of time, and more especially the removals which take place on account of physical disability, profoundly affect the value of vital statistics, which are capable of comparison for different periods only if the liability to sickness and mortality of the units composing the body remains the same. When the fluctuations occurring from year to year are equal, or nearly so, the vital sta- tistics are capable of true comparison; but if, from any cause, such as an excess of invaliding or discharge of sickly and weakly men, the liability to sickness and death of the whole body is reduced, it is obvious that the significance of the sick and death rates is correspondingly modified. Holding these princi- ples in view, it is satisfactory to observe that the fluctuations which take place in the strength of the Native Army from year to year are so similar, and that the events of 1877 are rather against than in favor of low sickness and death rates; for the numbers invalided and discharged for physical disability are unprecedentedly few, either indicating greater healthiness of the men, or leaving a wider margin for sickness and mortality in the force. "Lines, sick" and "conva- lescent" lists. There is, however, one source of fallacy in the vital statistics of the Native Army which has been prominently brought to notice and discussed by Surgeon A. Barclay in his report of the 2nd Central India Horse, namely, the treatment of men out of hospital when their cases are of a trivial nature, or, when other reasons exist why it is desirable to allow them to remain in their lines. In
iii Cavalry regiments more particularly, it is expedient to permit men to stay out of hospital and look after their horses, unless they are so ill as to incapacitate them for work of any sort, or to require constant attention. If men so cir- cumstanced, or men discharged from hospital as convalescent before they have become quite fit for duty, are not registered and included among the sick, it is obvious that the returns must understate the number of men incapacitated for duty by sickness, and the amount of incapacity caused thereby. Moreover, as different medical officers might, under such a system, entertain different views and adopt different practices as regards the kind and degree of sickness necessitat- ing treatment in hospital, the statistics of different regiments would not be capable of comparison. The radical remedy for this source of fallacy would be to admit into hospital every man in any way incapacitated by sickness for the full performance of his duties, and retain him in hospital so long as he may continue to be so, or until he proceeds on sick furlough; but it would attain the same end as regards the accuracy of hospital statistics, and entail no other inconveniences, if men unfitted for the performance of their duties by illness were placed and retained on the hospital registers, whether they were treated as "out-door" or "in-door" patients; and this is the system which I shall insist on for the future. All extraneous or supplementary lists or registers of sick sepoys are entirely unauthorized and open to serious mis- understanding and abuse; and the plain and simple rule in such matters is, obviously, that a man must be either fit for all or any duties, or on the sick list. His disposal and treatment while on the sick list are matters regarding, which the medical officer may, under the general sanction of the commanding officer, exercise his discretion.

The Central India Force. The Punjab Frontier Force. The Madras troops again present more favorable admission and death- rates than those of the Bengal troops. This result is apparent in every one of the five years embraced in the statement. It is not due to the removal of sickly men by invaliding or sick furlough; for in these respects also the Madras regiments present a favorable comparison with Bengal regiments. On analyzing the Native Army of Bengal into its three component sections, it will be observ- ed that the local regiments stationed in Rajputana and Central India, and constituting the Central India Force, render sickness-rates very nearly as low as those of the Madras troops, and give a somewhat more favorable death-rate. The experience of previous years demonstrates that the statistics of these two sections are very much alikeV tion in their number left a residue of comparatively more serious and prolong- ed sickness. The figure for 1876 was, however, unusually favorable; for the average period of detention in hospital in 1875 was 11.02 days, and in 1874, 11.2. The average period spent on sick leave does not possess the same signifi- cance as regards severity of sickness as the average period spent in hospital. 8. The total number of deaths was 847, of which 510 took place in hospital, 48 in the lines, and 289 among men not under medical supervision, on furlough, sick leave, &c. These three figures represent percentages of 60.3, 5.6, and 34.1 upon the whole number of deaths, against 60.2, 1.4, and 38.4 in 1876. The causes of death in the first two groups are accurately known; but in the case of absentees, except when they happen to have been admitted into a military or civil hospital and died there, the true causes of death are seldom ascertainable with sufficient accuracy to justify their admission into statis- tical returns. The rate of deaths "present" per cent. of strength "present" was .94 in 1877, against 1.05, 1.32, 1.06, 1.35, and 1.03 in the five preceding years, and the proportion of deaths in hospital per cent. of treated,.95, against.74, .94,.74,.93, and.92. These figures are not of much significance; but they present a remarkable similarity from year to year, and 1877 does not constitute a conspicuous exception to the rule of previous years. Analysis of mortaliy. 9. The average strength of European officers attached to the Native Army in 1877 was 601.64, against 572 in 1876. Among these, 275 were placed on the sick list, and 5 deaths took place, or 45.7 and.83 per cent of strength, against 44.93 and.69 in 1876, and 47.23 and.51 in 1875. Two of the deaths were due to violent causes. The other casualties were due to apoplexy, enteric fever and cholera. Statistics of European officers. The officers whose deaths were due to violent causes were Colonel Craigie, Commanding the 1st Native Infantry, and Captain Swiney, of the 17th Bengal Cavalry: the former casualty resulting from a carriage accident in canton- ments; the latter from a severe sabre-cut received in action with the enemy. The lesson plainly deducible from Captain Swiney's sad death is, that some of the native non-commissioned officers in every regiment should be carefully instructed in the use of field tourniquets, the application of bandages, and other simple operations, which they might easily master under a little patient instruction, such as Surgeon-Major J. E. Tuson, M. D., initiated in his regiment, the 16th. Bengal Cavalry, and which, I am glad to see, Surgeon G. P. Mackenzie, M.B., has been assiduously carrying out in the 3rd Bengal Cavalry also. Many a life may in the future be saved by the extension of the practice. 10.

vi These three arms contribute a proportion of 1.1, 19.4, and 79.5 per cent. to the strength of the Native Army. The figures representing the sickness of the three arms take the same relative position as in previous yearsvii 13. In Statement No. VIII the sickness and mortality of the Native Army is shown according to military commands, and the statistics of the four preceding years are re-produced for comparison. As regards sickness, the various commands take very much the same order as in previous years; though the rates present generally a lower range. This is more marked, however, in the case of the healthier commands. The Eastern Frontier and Presidency Districts, the Punjab Frontier, the Lahore Division, and Peshawar District, are the most sickly, both in 1877 and in the four previous years; and this is true as regards both the number and severity of cases. The principal departure from the rule of former years is manifest in the case of the Central India Force, which rises in the scale of severity. The Rawalpindi and Allahabad Divisions and the Rohilcund District are the healthiest in both series, the remaining commands holding an intermediate place. Statistics of the several military commands. As regards mortality, the principal departures from the experience of past years are in the cases of the Peshawar District, which shows a much smaller mortality than usual, and of the Sirhind Division and Rohilcund District and Rajputana, which rise in the scale. The causes of these features will be more profitably discussed in a future paragraph, when the diseases to which sickness and mortality were mainly due are under consideration.

Having in the preceding paragraphs displayed and commented upon the main statistical facts of the year, I shall now proceed to offer some observ- ations upon the various circumstances, as set forth in the appended reports, which exercised an influence upon the health of the Native Army during the year. Meteorologi- cal peculiari- ties of the year. 16. The year was, meteorologically, a remarkable and unusual one through- out the Presidency. It was characterized by an excess of spring rain, associated with diminished temperature, an absence, more or less complete, of "the rains," associated with an abnormally high temperature, and an excess of autumn rain. These conditions were universally prevalent in varying degree. They were more pronounced in Central and Upper India than in Bengal and Assam. They involved several consequences which possess an important relation to the sanitary history of the year. In the first place, owing to the absence of " the rains," the rivers did not rise and overflow their banks to the usual extent, nor was the land subjected, from direct and indirect causes, to the same degree of soaking as usual. The principal factor of malarious fever was, therefore, absent, or weak. I shall show in a future paragraph that there was a very marked diminution of malarious disease on the whole and in the majority of stations. Secondly, there was, in consequence of the failure of rain, a scarcity of food in many parts of the Presidency, almost amounting to famine, and everywhere the prices of food staples ruled high. The sepoys were, however, protected from any hardship or evil on this account by the compensation which is given them when the price of food exceeds a certain limit. Thirdly, the heavy autumn rains involved discomfort and exposure to troops on the move, more particularly in the Punjab, where regiments on frontier service encountered very trying weather. And, lastly, the high and sustained temperature of the hot months, amounting virtually to a prolongation of the hot weather through- out June, July and August, constituted a very unusual state of matters. The reports contain a general account of the meteorology and climate of all the stations in which troops were cantoned during the year; and though these have no pretensions to be scientific or exhaustive, they are necessary and instruc- tive elements in the consideration of sanitary conditions. The quarters of the Native Army. 17. It is gratifying to observe that attention continues to be paid to the important subject of accommodation. New lines of a superior kind. have been built for the 16th Bengal Cavalry at Allahabad and 5th Bengal Cavalry at Nowgong. These are carefully described in the reports of these regiments, the descriptions being illustrated by sketches showing the disposition and dimen- sions of the buildings. New lines have also been built for the 7th Bengal Cavalry at Morar and the 17th Bengal Cavalry at Peshawar. The lines of the 1st Goorkhas at Dharmsala have been completed. In many cases huts have been dismantled and re-built, and sundry improvements, tending to pro- mote their comfort and ventilation, made. The want of verandahs has been supplied in some instances. Existing defects. Still, though improvements are being accomplished in various stations, it cannot be said that the accommodation of the Native Army is, on the whole, satisfactory. The principal defects now existing are (1) the low level of the floors, which are actually in some cases excavated, and below the level of the ground. This condition should never exist. The floors of the huts of the poorer natives are almost invariably raised about a foot off the ground. level; and this should be the minimum height of the floors of huts. (2) The space, both superficial and cubic, is in most cases insufficient; 62.5 superficial and 875 cubic feet have been laid down as the rule for sepoys' barracks, but the reports show that in many cases less than half of this allowance is available. Raising the walls a foot or two would often remedy a deficiency of cubic space; and I observe that this measure has been adopted in one or two instances. (3) The want of ventilation is frequently noted; and this must, necessarily, aggra- vate the evil of insufficient space. Partition walls are a frequent cause of defective ventilation, and openings in these are destructive of privacy. Openings in outer walls are also a cause of discomfort, when there is no verandah. Over- crowding is often caused, more particularly in Cavalry and Madras regiments, by the men having their families living along with them. This is an evil with which it is difficult to deal. In other cases the family quarters when they are
xii Improvements required. separate from the barrack huts are reported to be ill-constructed and overcrowd- ed; and, as many of the men spend a large portion of their time there, this condition must operate prejudicially on their health. The principal indications for improving the quarters of sepoys arexiii at Shillong, further measures can be adopted to that end by sending specimens of the suspected water to the Chemical Examiner of the Province, or, still better, by deputing a competent officer for the purpose of examining the water on the spot. The reports show that in many cases "rough analyses" of waters were made by medical officers; and this practice will in future years become universal. The scanty rainfall and drought of the year caused wells in several Stations to become very low, or even to dry up, and deepening had to be resorted to in such cases. It does not appear, however, that this circumstance was a cause of disease in any instance. In some stations, as at Agra and Delhi, the water is apt to be brackish from the large admixture of saline ingredients obtained from the soil. The practice of occasionally filling wells from canals adopted in the latter station appears to be a good remedy for this condition. The pure filtered water supplied by the Calcutta Municipality is now in use by the troops sta- tioned at Fort William, Alipore, and Ballygunge, and there can be no doubt that the measure is eminently favorable to health. Difficulties appear to exist in procuring a sufficiency of the same excellent water at Barrackpore, for the use of the native regiments stationed there. The water used by the wing at Dacca is of very doubtful purity, and liable to serious contamination. The prevalence of dyspepsia and bowel-complaints at this station is attributed to this cause. The town of Dacca is, under arrangements resembling those in force in Calcutta, now supplied with pure water; but this unfortunately is not available for the wing. At Umballa wells have been sunk at some distance from cantonments, and a sufficient supply of good water is conveyed from them to a covered-in reservoir by an aqueduct. The arrangements for supplying water to the troops at Peshawar are the same as have been so frequently reported on unfavourably, but an improved system of covered channels will soon become available, and will, it is hoped, secure for this station a more wholesome supply. Precautions for preventing the contamination of wells, by masonry platforms, drains, and parapets, are everywhere adopted; but it is only at Mooltan that a pump has been introduced for drawing water from wells; and this does not seem to work well.

In consequence of the failure of the monsoon rains, and the very general wreck of summer crops, there resulted during the last half of the year scarcity of food and high prices of all descriptions of supplies. The degree of enhancement varied in different parts of the country, but provisions were everywhere unusually dear. There appears to have been, no difficulty any- where in obtaining a sufficiency of food at the advanced prices; but the quality of the article supplied was sometimes inferior, and had to be closely watched. Compensation for dearness of food was drawn throughout the Presidency. The amount varied, reaching, in the case of the 5th Madras Native Infantry at Saugor, as much as Rs. 6-14-2 in October. With their compensation, and the increased pay bestowed on the occasion of the Imperial Proclamation, the Native Army was well fed amidst a stinted, and perhaps starving, population. The reports are strong and unanimous to this effect. It is only in a few regiments that any disposition to under-feeding is reported to exist, more especially in Madras regiments, where men have large families and many dependents. Re- giments serving in Bengal are also apt, if not carefully watched, to adopt a rice in place of a wheat diet. There is evidence, however, that any tendency to under-feeding which may exist is capable of easy check by the commanding officer, and several instances are recorded in which his interference became necessary. The supply of food through the agency of regimental bunniahs enables the regimental authorities to find out what each man purchases, and it is easy to lay down a scale, and insist upon it as a minimum. The scale for which compensation is calculated is a good basis, and the withholding of com- pensation when the scale is not reached is a fair and effectual means of pre- venting under-feeding. Only 60 cases of scurvy have been registered throughout the year. The reports of the Bhopal Battalion, 42nd Assam Light Infantry, and 38th Native Infantry allude to a scorbutic affection of malarious origin which has been frequently observed in Bengal jails. It is important to distinguish this condition from true scurvy. The system of messing by troops or companies has been advantageously adopted in many regiments. The rationing of all native troops is advocated by some medical officers. The system works well in the province of Assam; but the experience of the year, which was one of general Food.

xiv Hospital diet. scarcity, shows that it is not really required as a rule. The troops on service on the Punjab frontier were also rationed. In both cases complaints are made that the men have to buy vegetables and extras in addition to the ration; and these in Assam are very dear. In the Punjab, scorbutic symptoms appeared in some of the regiments on service, which were speedily checked by the supply of fresh vegetables. Hospital dieting presents many difficulties, more especially in a regiment prostrated by malarious disease, as the 38th Native Infantry at Bar- rackpore; but medical officers are doing their best to meet them. The import- ant duty of inspecting bazars and supplies has been diligently carried out by medical officers and committees of native officers. Clothing. Great-coats. Undress clothing. Valise equip- ment. 22. No change of consequence has been made in the uniform clothing of native troops. In the 6th Native Infantry, khakee blouses or overcoats have been introduced, which are worn on fatigue duties. These no doubt contribute to cleanliness and neatness, as they must protect the tunics from soiling. In the 12th Native Infantry each sepoy has been provided with a great-coat, of English beaver cloth, which is said to be a great improvement upon the old country article. Woollen great-coats and capes of regulation pattern have also been furnished for the men of the 23rd Pioneers, 32nd Pioneers, 3rd Punjab Infantry, and 44th Sylhet Light Infantry. In the Punjab poshteens and chogas are used as great-coats. They are much liked by medical officers, and the fron- tier service of the past year put them to a severe test, which they stood well. In some regiments great-coats are used in addition to these garments. The pre- valence and fatality of chest diseases in the Punjab render this a matter of great moment, and it is satisfactory to find that these articles fulfil their purpose so efficiently. As regards undress clothing, the reports show that in many cases sepoys are neglectful in protecting themselves suffici- ently from vicissitudes of weather. This is more conspicuously the case in regard to Madras regiments coming to serve in the colder latitudes of Bengal; regiments moving in course of relief to up-country stations, and corps proceed- ing to occupy hill stations, such as Buxa and Shillong. Medical officers are fully alive to the importance of watching the men under such circumstances, and inducing them to adopt a warmer style of undress clothing, as in the 16th and 34th Native Infantry, 8th Bengal Cavalry, and 1st Punjab Cavalry. There is evidence that recruits are now better provided in this respect than formerly since the sanction of a free kit and the issue of blankets and pillows for use in hospital. Mention is made in the reports of the 4th and 5th Native Infantry of the introduction of a new valise equipment for the carriage of am- munition, &c., which appears to secure the important end of relieving the chest from constraint, and distributing the weight of those articles which the soldier has to carry in heavy marching order over the shoulders and loins. Blistered feet. Socks. 23. The boot question is still in an unsettled and unsatisfactory condition, and the testimony contained in these reports is of a conflicting and indecisive description. In some regiments "ammunition" boots are used, in others native shoes; and both are praised and condemned. It would serve no good purpose to analyse the various opinions recorded. If socks were worn with ammunition boots, and care were taken that these fitted accurately, and if, more- over, they were regularly greased, as in the Sappers and Miners (p. 96, X), inefficiency from blistered feet would, I am sure, be very rare. Socks ought to be laid down as an indispensable article of the sepoy's uniform. In the 9th Native Infantry I observe each man is provided with two pairs of socks. In the 11th Native Infantry a cheap description of native sock is used; but it has the disadvantage of being very thick, and not capable of being worn with boots. Surgeon-Major Potter, of the 18th Native Infantry, praises a boot supplied by Sir William Palliser and Company; and Colonel Winson mentions that an additional supply has been ordered, which indicates that the article has been found suitable. Surgeon Mackay, in his interesting report of the 32nd Pioneers, recommends a description of shoe worn by the Pathans, to which a legging is attached. The native shoe. The quality and build of the article designated as "native shoe" must vary; for some officers extol it, and in some regiments the ammunition boot has been discarded in its favor, while in other cases it is condemned, on the ground of causing ulcers upon the opposite ankle, or because, in heavy marching, it comes to pieces and has to be tied on.

The number of cases admitted into hospi- tal on account of blistered feet is shown in the following statement as compared with the preceding five years. The statement does not represent all the cases of blistered feet which occurred, but only those that were sufficiently severe to demand admission into hospital. The practice regarding these cases differs in ditterent regiments, and the large class of ulcers, no doubt, contains many cases due to injury caused by boots and shoes. The number of cases was, it will be ob- served, below the average of the preceding five years; but this cause still ac- counts for a considerable proportion of admissions into hospital; and it must be remembered that there was no severe marching in 1877, except in the case of the regiments that proceeded to Quetta and those that took part in the frontier expeditions. 24. Duty in cantonments has nowhere been so heavy as to affect the health of the men. The regiments at the Presidency are subjected to excep- tionally hard work on account of the number of guards. In Central India the Bheel Corps furnish a large number of escorts, and at Morar and Peshawar the Infantry regiments are required to do more work than at other stations; but it does not appear to be excessive. The corps which took a share in the Punjab Frontier expedition performed work of an arduous kind, under circumstances of hardship, which will be alluded to in a future paragraph. Duty. 25. The subject of providing exercise and recreation for native sepoys continues to obtain attention, gymnasia having now been organized at almost every station; and in addition to the feats of wrestling, &c., which sepoys in- dulge in of their own motion, arrangements have been made in many regiments for putting recruits and young soldiers through a regular course of gymnastics. The reports testify that this is highly conducive to improvement of the phy- sique and bearing of the men (p. 21). Recreations. Gymnasia.

Williams has, in the report of the 3rd Peshawar Mountain Battery, recorded some instructive notes on the topography and climate of this station. It is premature to pronounce on the salubrity or otherwise of Quetta; but the details indicate that very special attention will have to be paid to the accommodation and clothing of the troops. The Frontier expedition had not come to a close at the end of the year; and the reports of medical officers for the current year will, no doubt, discuss the medical and sanitary aspects of the expedition as a whole. This volume con- tains interesting notes regarding the circumstances of the service, as far as it had gone, by the officers in medical charge of the regiments engaged. These notes make it clear that the native troops underwent fatigue and exposure to sun and rain and cold with admirable spirit, and without any material injury to health. I would invite special attention to the report of Surgeon-Major W. S. Caldwell, which gives an excellent account of the sanitary circumstances of the expedition, as far as the 27th Native Infantry was concerned. Surgeon- Major Govan, in his report of the 3rd Goorkhas, relates an interesting expe- rience. While the regiment was returning, in February, from the Imperial Assemblage at Delhi, it encountered a snow-storm on the hills, which was so severe as to delay its progress for five days. The health of the men did not suffer any harm under these circumstances; though the sick and followers were not so fortunate. Dr. Govan's account of the sure-footedness of the camel does not consort with general experience. But it is important to know that this mode of carriage does not fail even in snow and slush on the hills. Experiences such as these prove to demonstration, that the Native Army is composed of material of excellent mettle, and is equal to whatever kind of service it may be called upon to perform, and able to surmount whatever difficulties and hardships service may entail. Hospitals. New hospitals. Improve- ments. Deficiencies. Cleaning of Hospital accommoda- tion at Quetta. 27. Many important improvements have taken place during the year in hospital accommodation. New hospitals of a superior description have been completed for the Cavalry regiments stationed at Allahabad and Nowgong; for the Infantry regiment at Benares, and for the 2nd Goorkhas at Dehra Dun. Descriptions of these will be found in the reports, which indicate that they are admirably adapted to their purpose, and fulfil all the sanitary requirements of the day. Radical alterations have also been made in the Infantry hospitals at Jullundur, Ferozepore, and Rawalpindi, tending greatly to improve them. New Infantry hospitals have been commenced at Morar and Dera Ismail Khan, and sanctioned for the Cavalry regiment at Morar and one of the Infantry regiments at Agra. Many minor improvements have also been accom- plished, which are calculated to promote the comfort and welfare of the sick: such as the provision of coarse chicks and jhamps for the openings in veran- dahs, the insertion of fine chicks and purdahs in the doors, the erection of stoves and fire-places, the division of two large wards by partitions, and the erection of out-houses and isolation wards. In many stations wants still exist. Accommodation for hospital subordinates and servants is in many cases reported to be insufficient; and the hospitals occupied by the 20th Native Infantry at Peshawar and the 18th Native Infantry at Buxa are pronounced to be bad. The addition of a Zanana enclosure to the quarters of married hospital assistants is a thoughtful measure, which must encourage the comfort and respect of these useful officials. In some hospitals built on the old standard pattern, as that occupied by the 39th Infantry at Meerut, the 28th Infantry at Meean Meer and the 37th Infantry at Barcilly the glazing of winter season, be either very cold or very dark. The insertion of a few panes of glass in the doors would exclude the cold, without depriving the inmates of the benefit and comfort of light. This is a measure to be most strongly advocated on sanitary and humanitarian grounds; and I trust the present year may not be allowed to close without the necessary orders having been sanc- tioned. The augmented comfort of the sick in hospital will be out of all proportion to the money outlay required. Warmth and light cannot at present be enjoyed together, during the winter season in Upper India, by the sick in the ordinary. Native Infantry hospital. Hopital accommodation has not as yet been provided for the troops at Quetta, and the sick were treated in tents and huts. The supply of blankets and pillows, under the provisions of G. G. O.
xvii No. 681 of 1877, has proved a great boon; and in many regiments, the im- portant matter of hospital clothing and bedding has been made the subject of special regimental arrangement. The 2nd Goorkhas at Dehra Dun is the only regiment in which hospital clothing has been specially provided; but in the 6th Native Infantry at Lucknow and 36th at Barrackpore, sheets and counter- panes have been introduced, which subserve the purposes of cleanliness, neatness and refinement. The supply of fires in hospitals on a more liberal scale than formerly has been productive of great benefit to the sick. Alto- gether there is abundant proof in these reports that, within late years, many salutary changes have taken place in hospital construction and arrangement, which must greatly enhance the comfort of the sick, and contribute most materially to their recovery.

The sickly men of the 38th have been removed to Cawnpore, and the whole regiment is to be sent in course of relief to Moradabad and Shajahanpur, where no doubt, under the more healthy influences of these stations, it will regain its tone; but I am very strongly of opinion that lines which have apparently shattered the health of two regi- ments, and caused serious mortality in each, ought to be abandoned, and a bet- ter site sought for the second Infantry regiment at Barrackpore elsewhere, as near the bank of the river as possible.

Statement No. XV shows that 1877 is rather below than above previous years. These diseases are reported to be specially prevalent at Almora, Jhansi and Lucknow. The closure of the city lock hos- pital at the latter place is alleged to be the main cause to which this result is due.

xxi The particulars related in the reports of the 2nd Bengal Cavalry, 2nd Central India Horse, Meywar Bheel Corps,8th and 40th Native Infantry, regarding pre- cautions adopted to protect these corps from cholera, are interesting. Although small-pox was very prevalent throughout the Presidency, and prevailed severely in Cawnpore, Lucknow and Bareilly, only 37 cases and 5 deaths took place during the year in the Native Army. The reports show that the men are well protected against small-pox; and that when any men are found not to be so, care is taken to have them vaccinated. Chicken-pox, measles and mumps broke out in some regiments, but they caused very little disabling sickness; and there was an out- break of epidemic jaundice in the Deolee Irregular Force. Precautions against cholera. Small-pox, 34. Having now displayed the vital statistics of the Native Army as a whole, and of its component sections and units; and having passed in review the various influences affecting the life and health of the men, as well as exhibited the principal diseases to which sickness and mortality were due, I shall briefly dis- cuss, by way of summary, the causes which explain excessive sickness and mortality in the most unhealthy commands and regiments. Causes of sickness and mortality in the most unhealthy commands and regi- ments. 35. The Eastern Frontier District comes first in order of constant sick-rate, second in the series of admission and death-rates. It may, therefore, be held to be the least healthy command in the Presidency. This is due in part to the un- healthiness of the stations where the head-quarters of regiments are located, but largely also to the insalubrious " out-posts " to which the Assam regiments give detachments. The 18th Native Infantry at Buxa and the 35th Native In- fantry at Cachar present the highest sickness and death rates. Buxa has always been a trying station and the out-post duty at Cachar subjects the men to malarious influences. The 42nd Assam Light Infantry was very sickly at Gauhati, the depressing and morbific effect of which is forcibly depicted by Surgeon Wilson. The corps will, no doubt, recover its health somewhat under the more favorable influences of Shillong; but detachments will still have to serve in malarious out-stations. Two companies of this regiment proceeded on ser- vice in the Naga Hills. The statistics of the remaining regiments are more favorable. The change to Shillong has had a most favorable effect on the health of the 43rd; and the Station may be pronounced as well suited to native troops, provided certain precautions as regards food and clothing are taken. The high sick-rates of Assam regiments are to some extent due to the difficulties connected with giving men leave for change of air. The arduous journey to and from Assam more than neutralizes any benefit they might derive from the measure, and medical officers naturally hesitate to recommend it. Intermittent fevers, rheumatism, bronchitis and asthma, bowel-complaints, spleen-diseases, ulcers, and debility, are the diseases which account for the majority of admis- sions; and they exhibit high rates of prevalence, as compared with other com- mands. Injuries and blistered feet contribute to the sick-rates, but not in excep- tional excess. Ague, debility, remittent fever, phthisis, diarrhxxii The Punjab Frontier Force. Diseases causing sick- ness and mortality. 37. The Punjab Frontier Force occupies the third place in order of con- stant sick, the fifth as regards admissions, and the fourth in mortality. The 1st Punjab Infantry at Quetta gives the highest sick-rates; but all the regi- ments in this command manifest a high standard of sickness, and most of them a considerable mortality. This is due mainly to the unhealthy stations occupied and the trying climate of the Frontier generally. Some of the regi- ments suffered from the hardships of service, as I have already stated. Chest diseases are the most conspicuous speciality of the Punjab Frontier; but fevers, rheumatic affections and bowel complaints also present high figures. The morta- lity was due principally to chest-diseases, remittent fever, ague and bowel complaints. The Lahore Division. Diseases. 38. The Lahore Division comes next in order of sickness, but ranks sixth in order of mortality. The high sick-rates were contributed mainly by the two Infantry regiments at Meean Meer, which suffered severely from fever. This seems an inevitable ordeal both in this station and at Morar. The quar- ters occupied by both the 9th and 26th Regiments are reported to be very inferior. The 1st Goorkhas at Dharmsala were also unhealthy; fever being the main cause. Fever is conspicuous among the diseases causing sickness; but the proportional prevalence of chest and bowel complaints and rheumatism is also high. Spleen disease gives a high, but not extreme, figure. The, Peshawar District. Diseases. 39.The Peshawar District, though ranking fifth as regards constant sick- ness, comes first in respect of number of admissions, and appears unprecedently low in the death list. The past year was, indeed, a favorable one for Peshawar. The troops suffered from fever to a great extent, but its amount fell short of pre- vious years, and its type was mild. The 7th, 14th, and 22nd Infantry Regiments were the least healthy. The two latter proceeded on service towards the close of the year. The accommodation of some of the Infantry regiments is inferior, and the water-supply liable to contamination. The Peshawar District is facile princeps, even in the past healthy year, as regards the prevalence of malarious fevers. The figure for spleen disease is also high. Rheumatism, chest diseases, and bowel complaints also exhibit high figures. The Sirhind and Gwalior commands. 40. The comparative unhealthiness of the Sirhind Division is due to the high figures contributed by the 12th Native Infantry at Jullundur, whose de- tachments at Ludhiana and Phillour have been, as usual, very unhealthy. The men also suffered from bowel-complaints at Delhi, owing apparently to impure water. The 41st Native Infantry at Morar suffered severely from fever; and this explains the position of this command in the sick list. The circumstances and causes of this fever are very intelligently discussed by Surgeon Lewtas, the officer in medical charge. Itch and guinea-worm in central India. The disproportionate prevalence of itch in the Bheel Corps is noticeable, and the large number of cases of guinea-worm in Rajputana and Central India. Efforts are being made to train the Bheels to greater personal cleanliness. The prevention of guinea-worm is a more difficult problem. It is, however, a comparatively rare disease in this Presidency, though there have been occasion- ally striking instances of extraordinary prevalence of it among the Native troops, notably in a wing of the 15th Native Infantry at Khytul in 1843. The cinchona febrifuge. 41. During the year herein reviewed the "cinchona febrifuge," in sub- stitution of quinine, in the treatment of intermittent fever, has been largely introduced into the practice of all Native hospitals, and with perfectly satis- factory results. There is really no difference of opinion as to its entire suitability in the vast majority of fevers; in fact, the cases have been very exceptional where complete reliance was not placed on its antiperiodic power. This was to be fairly anticipated, since I only ventured to recommend the drug as an efficient remedy after extensive and special experiments with it had been carried out most loyally by a large number of medical officers in civil as well as in military employ. Though the economic advantage of the substitution of this cheap sub- stance in lieu of quinine is one well worthy of being considered, it is by no means the chief one. The satisfaction of feeling that we have always at our command locally a medicine of undoubted efficacy in the great mass of the cases in which quinine was supposed to be the sole remedy can hardly be overstated,
xxiii especially as there is much reason to believe that improvement may yet be effected. in the manufacture of the drug, without much modification of existing machinery. Though in the experience of the past year there has been a happy exemp- tion from the supposed injurious symptoms inseparable from the exhibition of the drug, it has been thought advisable to push our inquiries still further, and to see whether it is not possible, by combining certain of the alkaloids in definite proportions to exclude completely the less salutary principles, while retaining to the full the real efficiency of the febrifuge. With this view, a triple combination of the commercial sulphates of quinine, cinchonidine and. cinchonine, suggested by Dr. King, of the Royal Botanic Gardens, and. Mr. Wood, Chemical Examiner to the Government, has been prepared and issued to some selected medical officers for trial and report with the view of ascertaining by the simple process of elimination what constituents of the " cinchona febrifuge " may be advantageously excluded. Though this investigation may not really be necessary, it is well to leave no- thing undone which may possibly silence all objections in the future against the universal introduction of the indigenous article: cheapness, freedom from adulteration, and constancy of supply, are advantages of a very solid nature. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, J. FULLARTON BEATSON, M.D., Surgeon- General, Indian Medical Department.

Drainage, &c. As regards drainage, conservancy and water-supply, no change has taken place. Hospital latrine. The hospital latrine, described in the report for 1873, has, been somewhat enlarged, and glazed gumlahs substituted for those previously used. A Crowley conservancy cart has also been obtained, in which the filth is removed daily, and discharged into one of the main sewers of Calcutta about a mile from the hospital. I have merely to add that the system has worked admirably throughout the year. Diet. Price of food- supplies. IX.

I am inclined to think an important element in the causation was the continued residence of the regiment, an up-country one, in Bengal. An undue proportion of fever, dysentery and diarrhoea occurred while the troops were out at target practice at Dum-Dum, arising, there is little doubt, from the condition of the encamping ground, which at times was little better than an ordinary swamp. Insufficient undress clothing, as mentioned already, and want of proper care on the part of the men in changing their dress, were important factors in the production of those diseases which are predisposed to, or excited, by chills Causation.

I cannot say that either this or the heavy duties have had directly any unfavorable influence on the health of the men.

There is room for 80 patients, and the highest number under treatment during the year was 65, average 21.55. XV.

There is no doubt that it is a very valuable remedy, although inferior to quinine. It is very seldom that it has given, rise to gastric irritation or giddiness, and probably where it did so the same effect would have followed a dose of quinine or any other anti-periodic. Sixty-six recruits joined during the year, and 7 were discharged for physical disability. They are, as a rule, of very good physique, and above the standard laid down.

The attacks of ague were of a persistent nature, and more severe than in 1876, when they were of a mild but recurrent form. The causes of the excessive sickness of the regiment were described in the report for last year, and these still exist, viz.,. (1) original inferior physique of the sepoy on enlistment, but this has been in a great measure remedied by a careful selection of well-developed, healthy recruits; neverthe- less, recruits still suffer to a large extent; (2) three years' residence at Baxa Duar, Bhutan, in 1873, 1874, and 1875, where, owing to climatic and dietetic causes, all diseases were of an asthenic or scorbutic type; (3) then a change to a damp malarial station like Barrackpore; (4) unhealthy, low-lying, and badly-drained lines; (5) the very heavy duties; (6) a dislike on the part of the men for service in Bengal, and the resulting depressive effect; (7) the unvaried ration of the native soldier, and his abstinence from animal food. The regiment was inspected on the 3rd December 1877 by Deputy Surgeon General R. Cockburn, with the result given below:12 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OP BENGAL. Epidemics.

Dysentery, which caused the next highest number, was readily amenable to ipecacuanha, and bael was also found useful. Syphilis caused 22 admissions, and this is said not to represent the whole number of cases occurring in the regiment; for the men have a delicacy in coming to hospital for venereal diseases. No preventive measures are adopted at Bhagalpur. The statistics of rheumatism are said to be unreliable; because many of the cases are held to be either trivial or simulated.

There is only a narrow strip of water between it and the lines, which is daily forded by people crossing the river. The river is also silting up towards the west of the station, from which side the current runs, and it is thought by some of the old inhabitants of Dacca that in a few years it will become a mere stream. The bit of marshy ground in cantonments, also mentioned in last year's report, was covered during the hot weather and rains with jungle, so tall and thick, that cows feeding in it could hardly be seen, A large surface drain has now been dug, which will probably cause much improvement.

It is only reasonable to suppose that our immunity from small-pox was in a great measure due to this. There was, in fact, no nidus for the disease. Small-pox appeared amongst the native civil population of the district towards the end of February, and cholera early in March. Small-pox appeared to diminish as cholera increased. Cholera was much more prevalent than in the previous year, especially in the month of April. On 20th May, there was a fall of rain (1.5 inches). This was followed by a very marked diminution in the number of cholera cases. At the end of May, again, there was a slight recrudescence, but only for a short time. In the month of November there was some hooping-cough amongst European children in cantonments. We had no case in the regiment. Towards the end of the year, a few cases of dengue occurred amongst the European inhabitants of cantonments; none that I am aware of amongst natives, and none in this regiment. Vaccination. XIX.

The dry-earth latrine trenches occupy a piece of ground lying west of the lines; this piece of ground is, however, too small, and already the trenches have advanced unpleasantly near to the lines. The presence of the river Morar makes it impossible to dig trenches further to the west, and there will be no alternative but to make them at an inconvenient distance from the lines, until the ground already turned over shall be ready for second use. For the accommodation of those using the trenches, both mat and wooden screens are provided; the former are unfitted for the purposes for which they are intended, as they afford no protection from rain or sun, and during high winds are frequently blown down. There are not these drawbacks to the wooden screens moving upon wheels, and they, moreover, afford more complete isolation to each man from others who may be using the trenches at the same time. I would therefore strongly recommend these to the exclusion of mat screens, and the more so that every inducement is necessary to prevail upon sepoys to make use of the trenches. Trench Latrines. The trenches being unavailable for men in hospital, the excreta of the latter are collected in iron filth-pans which are every night carted to filth pits at a considerable distance from the lines.

Improvements suggested. moisture towards the front, where the whole drainage of the lines is received by a cutting leading to the Koomraree nuddee. At the bottom of the centre and larger interval is the original quarter-guard, and in rear of the lines, and separated from them by an interval of some 60 paces, is a new row of small bungalows for native commissioned officers' quarters. These, in structure, are quite equal to miniature dk bungalows, and face towards the lines looking north-east. On the right flank in front is the mistry-khana, and on the left flank in front is a building which accommodates the regimental schoolmaster, moonshee, and others belonging to the regiment. On the right flank in rear is a building for the Muhammadans of the regiment to attend to religious observances. The regimental bazar (in consequence of some buildings remaining in that position which could. again be utilized), is at present in rear of the native officers' bungalows on ground higher than the regimental lines. I certainly think that when. a favorable opportunity offers, this bazar should be removed from its present position, either to the right flank, or in halves to the two flanks of the lines, or to some other position where it will not shut out the free current of air from the public road running between the cavalry lines and Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 7 compounds. In its present position during the ordinary rainy season, its watershed must be towards, instead of from, the regimental lines. It abuts too closely on the public road before-mentioned, thereby destroying the picturesque appearance of this portion of cantonments, besides shutting out air from the compounds mentioned (to which future occupants might object). Moreover (as often happens), if contagious disease at any time should break out in this regimental bazar, it would be difficult to place it in quarantine whilst situated close to a main thoroughfare, only a few yards from officers' com- pounds, and between them and the regimental lines. The stables for native officers' horses are situated on the same ground as the bazar, in rear of each native officer's bungalow, and open south-west towards the public road. I think it would be a decided improvement if they were at the side of each native officer's bungalow and made to open north-east, so as to front towards the regimental lines. This arranement would leave a free open space, which is well studded with trees, between the native officers' quarters and the public road before-mentioned, and the Hindoo and Sikh places of worship; and native officers' bungalows alone remaining on this higher ground, the appearance of this part of the station would not be spoilt and air would not be shut out during the hot and rainy seasons in future. Of course cattle detained about any bazar, as well as horses in stables, must deposit on the surface a good deal of urine, &c., which becomes absorbed by the surface only to be washed towards the regimental lines and towards lower ground (where the regimental wells are situated), during heavy rain. Any one having to go from the regimental bazar to the latrines must pass through the regimental lines; at present the latrines being situated well out to the left front of the lines near the Koomraree nuddee.

SAUGOR DISTRICT. 53 The hospital, which has been occupied by the sick since the 2nd November, was previously occupied by the sick of D-3 Royal Artillery, and I believe in former years was the hospital of the old light cavalry. It is a roomy building, situated on the left flank of the new lines at a short distance. It is, in my opinion, suitable in every respect for the treatment of native sick soldiers, and is almost the same as the old standard native infantry hospital of the Company's time. It consists of a long centre ward, two entrance vestibules, four corner rooms (for office, medicine, and dispensing store-room, and a room convenient for isolating a case of contagions disease, or treating a case in a quite darkened atmosphere). On either side of the centre ward is a long closed verandah, wide enough for receiving patients, too numerous to treat in the centre ward when fever is in excess after an ordinary rainy -season; and the outer wall of this closed verandah is protected from the direct rays of the sun by an open, narrow verandah.

Brinton's plan of giving an (ipecacuanha) emetic early (with a view to relieving gall-bladder and more readily producing diaphoresis) has been almost invariably adopted, and the cinchona febrifuge in 5-grain doses, with dilute sulphuric acid, has been used in the place of quinine in 3 to 5-grain doses which I in previous years usually found enough for native soldiers after the effects of the emetic had passed off. But I believe that the good anti-periodic effects of even large and repeated doses of cinchona febrifuge or quinine may be wasted, unless by an emetic or cholagogue aperient the toxmic effects of vitiated bile are first got rid of. Ten cases of rheumatism occurred as com- pared with 26 in the previous year, probably depending on decrease in rainfall; also 17 cases primary syphilis, and 1 case secondary syphilis occurred as compared with 20 primary syphilis and 6 secondary syphilis in previous year. These venereal diseases have been generally reported to have been contracted by contagion which is at present not within scope of cantonment lock- hospital regulations. Injuries.

Return of rainfall. of the rice, maize and bajra crops, and the unwonted demand upon our supplies by the large number of emigrants wandering throughout these provinces. As the year has been so remark- able in its rainfall I here give an analysis of it in greater detail than usual. Rainfall for the year 1877. Month. Total fall in inches. Number of days on which it fell. Date of fall (inclusive). January ... ... February 1.46 1 6th instant. March ... ... April ... ... May 0.61 3 4th, 7th, and 17th instant. June 4.44 7 3rd, 7th, 24th, 25th, 28th to 30th instant. July 5.16 6 1st, 13th to 17th instant. August 3.06 9 4th to 6th; 25th to 29th; 31st instant. September 0.20 1 1st instant. October 1.80 2 6th, 7th instant. November ... ... December 4.26 5 6th to 9th; 18th instant. Total 20.99 34 Thus it becomes apparent that not only was rain deficient in quantity, the usual annual fall being over 50 inches, but most irregular in its distribution. Level of sub- soil water. With reference to the level of the sub-soil water, no means were at hand for recording it accurately. I ascertained, however, before the rain of December, that numerous wells, which usually contain water up to the commencement of the hot weather, had become completely dry, and others, which at that time of the year generally contained water to a depth of from 6 to 7 feet, then contained only half that quantity. Thus there had been a considerable subsi- dence of the sub-soil water. Crops. The rain of the 6th and 7th October fell just in time to save the joari crops which were beginning to droop from the excessive dryness of the soil and air. The rain which commenced to fall on 6th December, in a manner simulating the commencement of the rainy season pro- per, was also most opportune, giving an immense impetus to the growth of the cereal crops, which were just sprouting, and which would otherwise inevitably have perished to a large ex- tent. Agricultural prospects here were much brightened by this late rain. Lines, conser- vancy. No change has taken place as regards the lines or their drainage. Conser- vancy arrangements continue the same, and the supply of water was ample and good. Diet. IX. Diet. 63 CENTRAL INDIA. The admissions, 92 in number, are very few in number, and below those of any of the preceding 8 years, but the figure does not represent the whole sickness of the regiment, because a certain number of men are placed on the "lines sick" list. The following table shows the number of these:64 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. Cholera among emigrants. From the special report on the outbreak of cholera among the emigrants as seen at Goona, which I had the honor to submit in December, it will be seen that 75 cases were treated with a mortality of 60 per cent. This large mortality is to be attributed not only to the severity of the type of the disease, but also to the reduced condition of the patients from extreme poverty previous to attack, and the late stage in which treatment is generally commenced. Measures adopted to guard the station. Measures were adopted to guard the station against contamination by these emigrants. These have been fully detailed in the special report, and apparently proved successful. They consisted mainly in diverting the stream of travellers, protecting the city from suspicious visitors, and treating those actual- ly seized in special segregated places. Vaccination. XIX.

The Banswara detachment has had an average present strength of 25.81 for the year, and a total strength of 30.98. The amount of minor escort and command duty has as usual been considerable. An escort of 93 men accompanied Captain MacRae in December 1876, to Banswara, returning to head- quarters 11th January 1877. The Kotra detachment is purely a local force, never being relieved, although the men come to Kherwara for musketry practice. The Oodeypore and Banswara detachments are relieved every two or three months. IV. Meterology and climate. 66 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. were not held. They are now held regularly. All the men with itch are sent to hospital until well; and on their discharge, they have to make up their duty for the number of days they were in hospital. Daily bathing parades are held for all itch patients, and it is hoped by these means to keep the men cleaner. These large "admissions" of itch give the appearance of a greater reduction of the effective strength than is really the case, as nearly every one, if necessary, could go out to duty at any time. The endeavour is to make things unpleasant for them, if they will not keep themselves clean. At one of the first of these weekly parades over 50 itch cases were found. It is needless to point out how very objectionable such a state of things must be to officers superintending the musketry course. Principal causes of sickness. Guinea-worm. XVI.

Vegetables are said to be scarce and dear in the hot weather, but Mr. Odevaine is inclined to attribute the spongy condition of the gums, occasionally observ- ed, to malarious rather than scorbutic causes. It is intended to change the colour of the hot weather unifom from white to brown. Food. The shoes now worn by the men answer their purpose very well, and in support of this statement I have only to say that not a single case of blistered feet has been recorded in the whole regiment during the year, notwithstanding that pretty strong detachments marched all the way from Delhi to Sehore, and that the whole strength at head-quarters, not otherwise employed, are frequently out "route marching". Shoes. In contrast to the above, I would refer to my remarks on the subject at page 104 of the annual sanitary report of the Bengal army for 1870. The shoe at present worn is that of the country, the leather being soft and limp, and the sole not too heavy. Buff leather gaiters are being supplied to the men, which are fastened over the trousers, the latter being somewhat of the Zouave pattern; besides giving the sepoys a smart appearance, these gaiters are of use in protecting the upper part of their feet when marching through thorny ground or jowar stubble fields, &c.

The portion of the Bahraich district about here is very flat, highly cultivated (at present chiefly barley mixed with mustard and sugarcane), and abounds with beautiful topes of mango trees. Irrigation in the immediate vicinity of the camp would, I fancy, even in ordinary seasons, be anything but required; but here and there further on towards Baraich signs of its use are met with, chiefly in the form of the long bamboo weighted at one end, leathern bag and kutcha well. The soil is a light sandy one. It is a curious fact that the grass here, whatever the cause may be, although excellent for horses, does not suit cows or buffaloes, whose condition and amount of milk comes down at once. The villagers say this is pretty general throughout the district, and an officer in the regiment who brought out his cows, soon finding that the abundance of that kind of food here was worse than the poverty of Lucknow, was glad to send them back again.

In addition to the first alluded to, the third case proved fatal. Another admission and death from cholera appears in the minor return for officers; but, although both events are recorded as having taken place at Fatehghar, I think the following facts prove that the disease must have been contracted in Agra. Captain B. P. Hodgson joined the head-quarters of the regiment on the 14th October, on his return from six mouths' leave in Cashmir, and started for Fatehgarh on the 27th. Eight hours after he had left Agra, he was seized with symptoms of cholera while in a dk gbarry, and died at the former station the following evening. In all instances the inmates of the affected and adjacent buildings were at once removed, the patients on the first four occasions to tents, and in the last two to temporary grass huts, while the healthy men were sent to tents and empty barracks. Causation. Surgeon Reid proceeds to discuss the leading theories of cholera causation in the light of these facts; but as the considerations and arguments adduced have been already published in the Indian Medical Gazette (January 1st, 1878 ), it is not considered necessary to reproduce them here. The general conclusion is that the "atmospheric theory" chimes most closely with the facts, Vaccination. XIX. Vaccination.89 MEERUT DIVISION. 15th May another, 160 strong, under a European Officer, marched to Morar, in charge of treasure, and returned on the 31st of the same mouth. A detachment of 155 men, under a European Officer, has been posted at Fatehgarh since the 5th December. The exceptional weather, already described in the report of the 8th Native Infantry, was the most remarkable circumstance in the sanitary history of the year. The water used by this regiment has the same defect as in the case of the 8th Native Infantry. Trench latrines are in use, and work well. Though the number of admissions for blistered feet is small, this is owing not to any exceptional merit in the boots used, but to the practice of only admitting severe cases into hospital. The issue of a "free kit" to recruits and of blankets to hospi- tals is considered to be a great boon. The recruits and young sepoys are put through a course of gymnastics by the Adjutant with benefit. The same hospital is in use, but arrangements for the erection of a new one are in progress.

Hospital and bedding. 20 feet, the walls being 13 feet 4 inches high. The flooring is of bricks laid edge-wise. There are 20 doors and as many windows, and there are two fire-places in each ward. It is calculated for 50 beds and gives 60 superficial feet per bed. At each end of the building are two rooms, each 12 feet square; those at the eastern end are used for dispensary and office; those at the western for separate wards. The two wards of the hospital are connected by a large, wide arch. In addition to the foregoing, are two buildings of brick, roofed with tiles, for infectious diseases. They consist of three separate wards in each, measuring 11 feet square each room. These buildings are at some little distance from the hospital and on a lower level. The out-houses consist of a good bath-room, cook-house, two sets of quarters for hospital assistants, a set of 12 rooms for hospital servants, a dead-house and latrines, all excellent and in good repair. No fuel is allowed for the hospital. Each ward is lighted by a large lamp. The patients bring their own bedding. Up to the number of 50 sick, there is allowed from the hospital for each man one koorta, one pyjama, one sheet and one pillow-case. The ventilation is thorough: no crowding. Altogether the hospital and out-houses are excellent and sufficient for all ordinary requirements. There is also a guard-room about 60 feet to the north-west of the hospital.

Pathans do not much use milk, but eat meat more plentifully than the other castes, consuming every alternate day 4 chittacks of mutton or goat's flesh, of the value of 8 pies, at the rate of 2 annas per seer. The Mahomedan and Hindustani sepoys eat meat about once a week, using 4 chittacks or 8 ounces of mutton or goat's flesh at a meal. The Sikhs very occasionally have the opportunity of eating meat, as they are precluded by their religion from using the bazar meat, killed by a Mussulman butcher.

The men's huts are kept in good order, and are probably no worse than those of other native cavalry regiments. Still, Surgeon-Major Watson would like to see a better style of accommodation available for native soldiers. The dwellings of the regimental servants and camp-followers were improved in the hot weather. The trees which were planted last year have not made much progress. The dra inage of the lines is not quite satisfactory owing to backwater during heavy rains. A sluice gate has been put on the principal drain, but the water regurgi- tates through the others. Banking with earth temporarily during heavy rain would, it is believed, be a better plan. Some of the drains were widened; deepened and bridged during the year.

As the men occupied the same station and lines, and were therefore exposed to the same local influences in both years, the above return shows how much the prevalence of this disease is influenced by climatic causes. Attention has been called in para. IV of this report to the difference in the rainfall in the months of July and August in the years 1875 and 1876 as compared with that of the same period of the past year; and it is probably to this that we must look for an explanation of the great prevalence of fever during the two former years, and. its comparative rarity in 1877. On comparing the second table of the rainfall given in para. IV with the one shewing the admissions from fever, it is difficult to resist the conviction that they stand in some close relation to each other as cause and effect. It has been already stated that the canal irrigation in the station has not been less, but if anything a little more than in 1876, and therefore it is evident that this cannot per se be blamed as the cause of the frequency of intermittent fever at Meean Meer. It may, perhaps, be thought that the small amount of fever in the regiment this year is due to the men having become habituated to the climate of Meean Meer, and this would to some extent be borne out by the fact that a large proportion of the admissions from fever in October and November of this year have been amongst the recruits; but I do not think it in any Way explains the remarkable difference in the two years, as in 1876 the disease was almost universal amongst both old residents and new arrivals.

Owing to its low level and consequent bad drainage, the site is, after rain, little better than a marsh. The extent of the cantonment comprises 8,336 acres, or 13 square miles. The soil consists of a stiff clay mixed with "kunkur," about 8 feet deep; about 6 feet of clay without kunkur underlies this; then come 3 feet of light sandy clay, and lowest of all an unknown depth of fine grey sand. Water is found at about 30 feet. The soil is almost a dead level, falling into depressions in places and presenting serious obstacles to drainage. V.

All "solutions of continuity" of the integument took long to heal; an average of 19.29 days appears for each case, showing a deficiency of reparative function. Though the returns show statistically an average state of good health, a careful analysis cannot but impress one with the idea that cachexia is the penalty demanded by acclimatization as regards malarious disease.

The disease bore an exceedingly close resemblance to relapsing fever; and reminded me greatly of an epidemic of the latter which I met at Ferozepore 1864. The two deaths from it occurred in young men of healthy and robust constitution. There was also a remarkable prevalence of ordinary intermittent fever during May, June and July, a season in which ordinarily the sick-rate from paroxysmal fevers is minimised in this district. Two conditions may be remarked as being with some probability causually connected with it, viz., the rainfall of 2.33 inches in April, which was not only heavy, but most unusual for that month, and the great diurnal ranges of, temperature which prevailed through the first part of the hot season. The men of the regiment, from having suffered so severely from fever in 1876, were probably also much more susceptible to changes of temperature and the malarial influence than other bodies of Men who came into the station in 1877. There were only five admissions for venereal affections, and of these, three were for gonorrhLAHORE DIVISION. 125 IV.

The men arrived in bad health from Peshawar, but have greatly improved since reaching Feroze- pore. There were only 13 in hospital on the day of inspection.

The Ordnance hospital was inspected at the same time. The building is a dilapidated old bungalow capable of accommodating about 32 patients: 9 men were under treatment out of a strength of 674.

The Lock-hospital was visited on the 27th November. It was under charge of Surgeon E. H. Fenn, A. M. D. There had been 84.8 women on the register, of whom an average of 4.2 had been under treatment. There had been 70 admissions for venereal in a strength of 854 European soldiers against 102 in the preceding year.

Vegetables, which are always rather dear at this station, became scarce, and more than usually expensive in the hot weather. These causes led, in the case of some of the men at least, to the use of an insufficiently nourishing diet, but this Was checked by an order of the commanding officer prohibiting all indulgences to Men reported as showing symptoms of scurvy or underfeeding.

The straps worn to fasten on the Pioneer tools are very badly placed, there being a piece of leather across the upper part of chest to keep the side straps in their places; consequently all the weight of the shovel or pick rests on this cross-strap: this could easily be avoided by continuing the shoulder straps to the waist belt in the form of an ordinary trace. The upward dragging on the waist belt would be counterbalanced by the weight of the ammunition pouches. The weapon is the short Snider. Duty. XI.

These appeared at first as it they were stagnant, but lower down we came across running water coming out of the sand. The water in all these nullahs have a peculiar way of disappearing and turning up again some distance off. Water at tins camp very brackish, The march to Kajuri was through the Soori nullah the whole way; steep cliffs on each side, and pools of undrinkable water were found here and there. The camp was on the side of a hill over the Kajuri nullah and at the junction of the five valleys; water brackish. Our next march was a very short one; the first half was a gradual ascent over a range, on the top of which we found the ground covered with fossils. Several perfect specimens of crabs, starfish, seaweed, wood, and a great variety of sea shells were picked up. A descent of about two miles brought us to our camp, Soti, on the banks of the Soori nullah again; water a little better. The first five miles of our next march was through the Sihaf nullah to a narrow, steep rocky pass about a mile long, almost impassable for camels. The regiment had to mend it before the camels could get along; the remainder of the road to Bugti Dun was sandy. Bugti Dun is a largish village, surrounded by a wall. Water was obtained from a nullah , and was good. There were several acres of ground under cultivation. Very little can be obtained here in the way of supplies. The road for the next three marches was fair, over stony ground intersected by numerous nullahs. Water fair and plentiful none to be obtained except at camps. Just before entering the camp at Dingan (Sulani-ki-khoond) we came across a small pool, 10 feet wide of yellow-looking water. The dogs had a drink and a swim; the horses had a walk through, and so did the camels. On arriving in camp we were informed that the only water to be obtained within five miles was in that pool. We had brought water with us from the last camp in pakals, but the men in charge had carefully filled them up with this coloured fluid on passing. It was perfectly undrinkable, and the day being hot, and there being no trees anywhere near, we were not sorry to leave this place. Our next march saw us out of the hills after about five miles of the Murwar nullah, the remaining fourteen miles being across the Kutchi, an immense plain covered with low shrubs and wild cabbage, and extending about 48 miles. We saw Lehri, seven miles off, looking as if it had been built on a mound and surrounded by a large mass of water. On arriving, the water had gone further on, and we found a large village surrounded as usual by a wall. This place is the great tannery of the district, and supplies of all kinds can be obtained here (mustard seeds and arrack), also vegetables, We had had no green food since leaving Rajhan, and our cook had forgotten potatoes. There is a squadron of the Sind Horse stationed here. We continued along the Kutchi next day to Mutch, though why it should be called Mutch or any other name we could not understand; for if we had not come across a ditch containing water, we might easily have passed it, there not being a tree, nor even a mud wall, to be seen; water good and plentiful. Continuing along the plain we came to a nullah (Nari), crossed it, and found the village of Mittri on the other side surrounded by a wall. Supplies of all kinds can be obtained, but dearer than at the next camp, Dadur. The 2nd Beluchis, Jacob's Rifles and a battery of artil- lery, with the 2nd Sind Horse were stationed here; they were in tents and complained very much of the cold winds which frequently blew. A mile beyond this place we passed through some low hills and over some swampy ground. Dadur is situated on a piece of high ground and is the cold weather residence of the Pass people. All the sheep, &c, are driven out of the pass to Dadur during the cold weather, returning to the Dust near Quetta in the hot. All the country roundabout this was cultivated and intersected by deep cuttings filled with water. The old cantonments are still standing in a wonderful state of preservation, water was plentiful and good, but there is a large sheet of very dirty-looking water just below the city, which, in the hot weather, must make the place very unhealthy. Three miles from this is Pir, the entrance to the Bolan Pass. At first it is between low hills, which gradually get higher and steeper. The Bolan River flows swiftly, now at one side and now at another side of the Pass; consequently in about three miles we crossed it seven times. The camp Khunch- lani is at the junction of the rivers Pushtal and Bolan. A moderate quantity of wood is to be found here. Camp ground rocky and limited; water very good. The first three miles of the next march was along the bouldery bed of the Bolan. The river had to be crossed nine times. About half a mile after the last crossing, we left the river, turning to our left, and slightly ascending, came into a plain, which we crossed again corning to a stream, on the side of which was Khirta, a small village. Here Government is building a serai and digging a well. Continuing along the pouldery river-bed, we encamped next day at the entrance of a narrow gorge, having the river to our right. The next day we bad to cross two branches of a river close to camp, and continued along a narrow path as usual; we came to Ab-i-gam, the last water. Here the river is very small; at the camp, and a little below it, it suddenly disappears in the sandy ground. Between Ab-i-gam and Sir-i-Bolan is a village to the right on a small cliff called Mutch. Government has a dept of stores here. A little further on to the right a jet of water comes out of a rock At Sir-i-Bolan, the source of the river, the water comes out of a rock in numerous jets; it is warm and tastes good. The rock itself is covered with beautiful moss and maiden-hair ferns. The first ten miles of the next march was through the Bolan Pass; the clans on each side were very nign and steep, and the Pass was very narrow and winding. We turned to our right over a citadel and descended a little, coming on the famous Dasht-ki-Daulat, a large plain surrounded by high hills. Continuing for about three miles over this, we came to our camp, Durwagao, a narrow place between the Great and Little Dasht. A well is being dug here, and a semi is to be commenced next month. The water was obtained from a pond of melted snow. This place is held in Brackish water. Kajuri. Soti. Bugti Dun. Dingan. Lehri. Mutch. Mittri. Dadur. Pir. Khundilani. Khirta. Bibinani. Ab-i-gam.

It is not a bad place, if there is no wind, snow nor rain; but if there is either of these, it is a fearful place. On our way across, we came on several dead camels, and also the bones of a man. Fortunately we had a beautiful day; the thermometer at night went down to 23Fahr. The march to Sir-i-Ab was over the great Dasht; it is said to be only 15 miles in the Route-book, but I should put it down as a good 19 miles. At this place we came across water channels, which are common beyond. The water is brought from the hills by underground channels; wells are dug about 30 yards apart, and are joined together by tunnels. By this means water is brought from and used for irrigating purposes. Seven miles beyond this is Quetta, at the end of the valley, with the pass to Candabar to the left, and that to Dera Ghazi Khan to the right. The town itself is built round a large mound, on which is the meri or fort, and the whole is surrounded by high walls. The cantonment is a little to the east of the city, and is on the lowest piece of ground about. The old cantonments are to the north, about one mile off, on a shingly soil, about 20 to 25 feet higher than we are. Hospital. XIV. Hospital.139 RAWAL PINDI DIVISION.

We remained a few days encamped in front of the village of Kandao. On the 7th December we were ordered to encamp in front of the Shirgussa Pass, through which one of the columns under Colonel Buchanan advanced on Bori. We remained at Shirgussa till the end of the year, with the exception of a few days spent at Fort Mackeson. The encamping ground is situated about half a mile in front of the Pass; it is a fairly elevated site intersected by large nullahs. The soil is soft and porous, and there is a good deal of sand and shingle mixed with it, the detritus of the neighbouring hills. The rocks in the hills are chiefly limestone, and the water is highly impregnated with salts of lime. The bed of a stream running through the Bori rocks is quite white from the deposit of chalk on the gravel. The water for the troops was obtained from a spring at the base of the Shirgussa ridge. It was probably free from organic impurities, at least at first, but it is very hard. According to recent authorities, this latter point is not of much importance in a hygienic point of view; its chief disadvantage being that it leads to the loss of much soap and is therefore unfavorable to cleanliness. The source of the water is liable to be polluted by the washings from the ridge, where a considerable portion of the troops had bivouacked for several nights, and where a strong party has been encamped since the beginning of the campaign. It is a significant fact that three cases of typhoid fever occurred among the British Officers in camp. No strict system of conservancy was carried out for the camp in general, and a great many of the native soldiers, and most of the camp-followers, resorted to the nullahs all round, which are filthy in the extreme. The health of the regiment has been excellent all through. Slight cases of dysentery and diarrhea were common, but there was almost a complete absence of chest affections. XIV.

The soil was a heavy clay, and being under cultivation When the weather was wet, which was a frequent occurrence, the ground became a perfect swamp, and it took several days of bright sunshine to dry. In many respects no worse ground could have been selected, but the water-supply was good and near, and the guns and detachment on the ridge only two miles distant, and on those accounts the camp was not sub- sequently moved. With this in view, surveys were made of the neighbouring country, but I believe in no one particular spot was there found sufficient water for the whole force, and a proposition of the General's to divide it into three camps was not carried out. On Christmas day a reconnoissance was made through the Bori Pass, and the regiment had a long and trying march, commencing at 4 A. M. and returning to camp at dusk. On the 31st the force again started at the same hour, and, marching through the Bori Pass, descended into the Peshawar valley, and at midday captured the Jowaki villages there after interchanging a few shots with the enemy. The head-quarters of the regiment occupied a deserted village, leaving two companies to guard the Bori Pass, and a company on a hill which commanded a Pushteoni village. In this valley, which is over 2,000 feet above the sea, there was intense frost, and the water in the bottles of the men who were on the hill became frozen, and in the morning they were unable either to drink or wash their faces. The water-supply was good and plentiful both from wells and small chur streams. The camp below the ridge. Capture of Jowaki villages. XIV.

The one about a mile on the extreme right of Shindee was held by the 5th Punjab Infantry. The Shum is well watered by nullahs, ponds and springs, and is bounded by high hills, which usually assume a parallel position as regards one another. About three miles directly in front lies the stronghold of Jummoo, imbedded among towering hills, and occupying an almost impregnable position. In front and to the right is the stronghold of Gareeba. Beyond these are the high hills of Mundehr-Sir, Doorgai-Sir, and Gareeba-Sir. Another valley and stronghold named Payah lies a few miles to the north-east of Shum, and separated from it by some low hills and an elevated plateau. This Jowaki valley was the first into which the 5th Punjab Infantry, forming a part of the Shadipur column under Colonel Gardiner of the 5th Goorkha Regiment, fought their way from British territory.

Small parties were also occasionally sent off on short excursions for the protection of villages threatened with Afridi raids. On the 9th of November the corps left its camp equipage, &c., at Lukha Talao, and advanced with No. 3, or the Shadipur column, against the Jowaki Afridis. It is still engaged in active field service in their country. XIV. Hospital.168 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. Blisters of the feet. Chest diseases. were left behind in hospital out of a strength of 414. "Diseases of the digestive system" were also less frequent, and milder in type in. 1877 than in the preceding year. Feet blisters occupy a prominent position in the list with 45 admissions. This is still lamentably high, but there can be no doubt as to the existence of a vast improvement in the regiment with reference to shoes and boots. A few years ago ammunition boots, English pattern, but of native manufacture, were worn at all times. They looked neat, but nothing further could be urged in their favor. They were badly made, ill-fitting, and a more fertile source of feet blisters than any other pattern of boot or shoe. Two years ago native shoes were substituted on marches or service for ammunition boots. The latter, however, continued to be worn on station and parade duties. Most of the men now wear native shoes on service, but many still cling to the ammunition boot, and suffer in consequence. I observe that some corps adopt a system of native shoes for cantonment work, allowing the men to wear on service whatever suits their own comfort best, and in these corps feet blisters are reduced to a minimum. Diseases of the respiratory system is the only group in which admissions during 1877 exceeded those of the preceding year. The increased prevalence of these affections was due to a severe winter and damp inclement spring. Coughs and colds were common in January, February and March, and it is worthy of note that during the intense cold of these months there were only two cases of pneumonia.

On the 18th August the head-quarters and 220 rifles were ordered to Gumbut, about 15 miles from Kohat, on the first outbreak of the Jowakis, for the purpose of holding the road towards Rawal Pindi. They remained there till the 4th September. The work, which consisted of patrolling the road from 6 A. till 4 P. M., was very trying on both officers and men, as the weather was excessively hot. On the 30th August the head-quarters, together with about 100 rifles of the cantonment detachment, took a part in that day's expedition in the Jowaki territory. This was an exceedingly hard day's work, the troops having been under arms from 2 A. M. to 9 P. M. without food, and frequently without water under a burning sun. In this business one officer and five men were wounded, and 2 men were knocked over by the heat. On the 9th November the head-quarters and 250 rifles marched again into the Jowaki country, forming a part of the present expeditionary force. Of these, up to date two have been killed and three wounded176 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. Principal causes of mortality. XVII. Principal causes of mortality.

On the 9th of November the head-quarters and about 270 rifles marched from Kohat as part of the Jowaki field force under Brigadier General Keyes, C.B., and have been engaged up to the end of the year in the various opera- tions against the Jowakis, conducted by that officer. The men have undergone a good deal of hardship and exposure, on numberless pickets and guards often in bitter cold and drench- ing rain, besides being but lightly provided for in the way of bedding. The commissariat arrangements were, however, good; the supply of food was abundant and of excellent quality; and to this fact I attribute in great part the excellent health enjoyed by the men. XIV. Hospital. 178 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL 4th Regiment, Punjab InfantryPUNJAB FRONTIER FORCE. 179 Comparing this return with last year's, the salient features are that the regimental strength was almost identical; its extern mortality 8 more; there were 23 fewer men invalided, and 7 less sent on sick leave. The number of days spent in hospital was materially lessened, being equal to over 3 days per man of total strength in favor of 1877. The actual number of days spent on sick leave was equal to 6 of a day per man of total strength in excess of 1876. This is accounted for by the more than usual severity of ailments the absentees were suffering from, resulting fatally in 10 instances against 2 last year. Not- withstanding all, it appears that, taking both factors into consideration, viz., the number of days spent in hospital and on sick leave, to wit, the total inefficiency for service per man of total regimental strength, there are three days per man in favor of 1877, which means that each sepoy in the regiment was on the annual mean 3 days more fit and efficient for duty in 1877 than he was in 1876.

Although heavy rain fell in the first-half of 1877, scarcely any fell in the autumn months, and this will account for the remarkable decrease in admissions from so-called malarial fevers and their consequences in 1877. The average sick for 1876 was 18.58, and for 1877 was 10.10. XVII. Principal causes of mortality.182 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. accommodation.

The Shawl valley possesses a rich, though tenacious and clayey, soil, with a substratum of kunkur; and there being numerous springs throughout the greater portion of its extent, large crops of corn are easily produced, and around the numerous villages flourish large gardens of fruit trees requir- ing but little attention, and yielding abundance of apricots, grapes, figs, plums, apples and melons, and several other fruits, but to a less extent. Other than in these gardens, but few trees, principally mulberry, grow in the valley. Lucerne grass (ushpusht) is extensively cultivated, grass existing in but small quantities, and only in the water-courses or on almost swampy ground, and in the winter it is unprocurable; cattle and horses having to be fed on bhnsa. Most of the springs of the. valley are superficial, but in several cases water is procured and conducted to its destination by a series of wells situated some 15 to 30 yards apart connected by tunnels, along Which the water flows, the wells decreasing in depth as they get on lower ground, till eventually water is brought into shallow channels for purposes of irrigation, &c. Quetta itself, situated in latitude 3012' north and longitude 6655' east, and at an elevation of 5,768 feet, is the principal town of the valley, and is surrounded by a mud wall, about 25 feet high and 1,500 yards in length, pierced with two gateways, the city itself being about 500 yards long by 250 broad. Within the enclosure is the miri (keep) on an artificial mound, about 80 feet high, with a command of the whole of the surrounding country. All the houses of the city are built of mud, and are in a very dilapidated state. The streets are narrow and filthy, and after heavy rain are ankle-deep in mud, no attempt ever being made to drain, clean, or repair them. The cantonments, commenced during the summer, are situated about three-quarters of a mile to the east of the city, on not very high ground, which previously had been under cultivation, but which, when the lines are completed and the ground well drained, may prove a fairly dry position. About two miles to the north of the city, on high uncultivated gravelly soil, the remains of walls of huts built in formation, and the quantity of pieces of black bottles, indicate the site of the encampment of the army of 1839.

There is little rain in the summer, and in winter only when the wind is south; it is therefore a matter of chance whether the weather is cold or mild, wet or dry. There are no roads yet, and in rainy weather the whole ground is turned into deep mud. The summer begins in May, and the weather continues warm till the middle of September, and dry till early in November; the spring is changeable.

Notwithstanding the sparse population, and the facility with which trees of the pine, family grow in them, the Khasia Hills near Shillong were almost bare of trees when the English settlement was established in 1866. The destruction of the timber was due partly to the large quantities consumed in iron smelting works, partly to the wholesale ruin of the young trees caused by the annual firing of the jungle. The firing of the jungle has now been prevented to a great extent, and large tracts of the hills, especially in the watershed of the streams which supply the station, have been reserved for the growth of timber. In a few years the effects of these beneficial measures will be apparent, and the hills, from being bleak and monotonous in appear- ance, will be pleasantly diversified by forest tracts.

Blisters of the feet, although caused in the first instance by wearing unsuitable boots, gave more trouble, and unfitted the men for a longer period for their duty than they would have done elsewhere. The third group is the result of local causes. Goitre is endemic among the residents. The Bhooteas suffer severely from it. The cases of scurvy were not of a severe nature, and they yielded rapidly to treatment, but men who were admitted for other complaints were sometimes found slightly affected by the disease, and it doubtless had its effect on some of the cases in the first and second groups. The cases in the fourth group require no particular remarks. Fifty-one of the respiratory affections were coryza, and 14 were pleurisy. There were no cases of pneumonia.
