No. 1306. FROM J. FULLARTON BEATSON, ESQ., M.D., C.I.E., Surgeon-General, Indian Medical Department, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, MILITARY DEPARTMENT. Fort William, the 16th December 1879. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward, for submission to.the Right Honour- able the Governor General in Council, the Medical and Sanitary Report of the Native Army in the Bengal Presidency for the year 1878. 2.The delay which has taken place in completing the report for publication has been occasioned by the sudden commencement of active service which involved a very large proportion of the Native regiments, and the peculiar char- acter of the operations in Afghanistan which necessitated an extreme curtail- ment of all superfluous baggage, so that in many cases the hospital records had to be left behind with the depôts and were not available until the return to cantonments in June 1879. 3.Moreover, the postal arrangements were often insecure, so that several official packets were lost in transit; and. Medical Officers had great difficulty in communicating with the depôt which remained in India, and in ascertaining the results of sickness among men, who had been transferred en route to base and field hospitals. 4.If it had been advisable to do so, an incomplete annual return, omitting to a wide extent the sickness, invaliding, and mortality, of the troops in the field might have been prepared much earlier; but such a breach in a compact series of statistics would have been much to be regretted; while it is, on the other hand, a wholesome discipline to require that duty should, be sustained, even under such a trying strain as that which has been caused by the campaign in Afghanistan. 5.The last annual return, that of the 21st Native Infantry, has only to-day been received back corrected, thereby completing the statistics; and I have much satisfaction in reporting to the Government of India that they are reason- ably accurate, regard being had to the many difficulties which have attended the compilation.

In Statement No. I the strength of the Native Army, founded on a daily census, represents the average of the year. By General Order 1 A., Military Department, of the 7th December 1878, the strength was tem- porarily augmented from 384 to 480 sowars in each cavalry regi- ment, and from 600 to 800 sepoys in each infan- try regiment; but any material increase will not come into force until 1879. The strength present represents the effectives who have been within reach of medical aid, while the strength absent comprises soldiers on leave, on. detached employ.
ii or on recruiting service who have been temporarily withdrawn from regiments. The "total" embraces the mean number retained on the regimental rolls. These vary in no appreciable degree from the strength of the various sections of the Native Army in 1877 and preceding years. The mean total of the Regular Army in 1877 was 44,755; in 1878, 45,105; of the Central India Force, 5,667 and 5,639 respectively; of the Punjab Frontier Force 12,370 and 12,352; and of Madras troops serving in the Bengal Presidency, 3,146 and 3,152; the grand total for 1877 having been 65,940, and for 1878 it is 66,248.

Excluding for the present all mention of the Madras troops serving in Bengal, the statistics regarding them being very partially available in this department, it is to be observed that the mean strength of the Bengal Native Army in all the sections had risen from 63,078 on the last day of 1877 to 64,576 on the 31st December 1878. There was thus a net increase of 1,498. The total accessions to the Native Army during 1878 were 7,824, while the permanent loss reached 6,326, the difference marking the absolute increase of strength. It is only necessary to explain the items of the permanent loss: 1,592 died, 1,724 were invalided, 738 were discharged for physical disability, 1,301 received dis- charges at their own request, and 970 were struck off for bad conduct, &c. With an ever-varying strength as a denominator, a comparison can only be accurately drawn by a series of percentages through several years, and this is given in Statement II. The loss by invaliding (other- wise pensioning) sepoys who are unfit for any further service in the field, has been higher in 1878 than in 1877, but lower than in-the three preceding years; the variation reaches as much as 12 per mille. in the quinquennial series. The number of men who left the Army at their own request exhibit a lower ratio than in any former year, while those who were discharged either for, physical disability or for misconduct exhibit no marked fluctuation, though both classes were in a proportion markedly higher than in 1877 STATEMENT No. III.

The greatly increased death-rate of 1878, as shown in the last figures, exemplifies the unparalelled excess of the general sick list which has befallen the Native Army generally throughout the year. In Statement III the facts of this general sickness are embodied in the sim- plest form; and on comparison with those of the previous decade, it will be seen that there have been admitted into hospital 178 per cent., 2.52 per cent. have died, and that the daily average of sick has been 5.25 per cent. The nearest approach to this rate of sickness occurred in 1869, a year remarkable for epidemic malarious fever, but to which the increased sickness from exposure on active service was not superadded. By way of contrast it may here be stated that in 1868, when the want of rain produced a famine in the North-West, and agues were almost unknown, the admissions were only 111.8 per cent., the deaths 1.65 per cent., and the daily average sick 3.72 per cent.

The several regiments composing each portion of the forces serving in Bengal have a sufficiently distinct isolation, and the results of service may advantageously be compared; but it is manifest that on the opening of war any geographical immunities, or pro- tective economies, at once disappear in the duties of a campaign, more or less shared by all branches. Regiments of the Regular Army and of the Punjab Frontier Force are brigaded together and suffer from similar exposure and pri- vation. Madras troops have garrisoned stations on the north-west frontier in considerable bodies; while, in the year under review, the Regular Army has not only crossed the frontier both at Sukkur and Peshawar, but experienced the vicissitudes of life in a voyage to Malta and the subsequent occupation of Cyprus. The Central India Force has alone remained stationary, and shows in the lower rates throughout, the advantages to health of a body of men who are harassed by no night duties, have no scarcity, nor stint of food, nor any great vicissitudes of temperature to encounter. It will be obvious that, under so many variations of duty and station, there can be no accurate comparison made with previous years from the figures of the remaining sections of the Army. They all share in the excessive sickness which has been the characteristic of the year. The figures of the troops in Bengal proper are greatly weighted by the severe epidemic of malarious fever and its consequences, which shattered the 38th Native Infantry at Barrack-pore. The statistics of the Madras Troops do not include any serving on the north-west frontier, but only those which occupied stations in the Saugor Command; and both these and the Central India Force are very favourable in comparison with the other sections. 10. The total number of admissions into hospital in the Native Army from all causes during 1878 was 99,453, and the daily average number of sick 2936.8;
iv the actual number of days passed. in hospital was 1,071,932; 1,649 men also proceeded on sick leave-and were absent from duty on that account 213,406 days. The grand total represents 3,520 men daily absent from duty on account of sickness, representing in other words five battalions of 700 men each. The same proportion for 1877 was 3.17 battalions; 1876, 3.51; 1875, 3.6; 1874, 3.5. The constantly ineffective ratio of sick to strength present has never before reached 5 per cent. 11. Each case admitted into hospital was detained there under treatment 10.5 days, a figure which is moderate and scarcely removed from an average of several years in which admissions were fewer; this is due, as was explained in last year's report, to the vast majority of admissions being from ague in different forms; a disease which multiplies admissions rather than retains men long under treatment. The average absence of men who were sent to their homes on medical certificate for change of air was as nearly as possible the same as for 1877, viz. , 129.4 days. 12. The total number of deaths was 1,592; and of these 1,166 occurred in hospital while under medical treatment; and in addition there were 68 who died out of hospital, that is, killed in action, by accident, suicide, or from any other form of death which took place before medical aid reached them; 358 men died while absent from the colours, either on sick leave, or on private furlough, or whose sickness, if any, was not recorded. 13. The average strength of European officers attached to the Native Army in 1878 was 639.6; among these 313 were placed on the sick list and 12 died. The percentage of the former was 48.9, and of the latter 1.8. In 1877 the figures were 45.7 and83 respectively; but in that year only 2 officers met with violent deaths, whereas in 1878, 5 officers were killed from gunshot wounds and 1 from fracture. Of the 313 admitted, there were agues 94, re- mittent and continued fevers 20, diseases of the digestive organs 53, surgical 36, rheumatisms 6, general debility 6, gout 10, other diseases 88. Besides the 6 deaths already noted, 2 occurred from dysentery, and 1 each. from.acute gout, remittent fever, typhus fever and gastritis. 14. The further subdivision of the Native Army into artillery, cavalry and infantry, which has been admitted into the annual report for some years, has, under my direction, been now discontinued. No sufficiently useful purpose seems to be answered by continuing these statistics indefinitely; it is sufficient that the figures are at hand for future reference and already covers a sufficient length of time to answer all practical questions.

In Statement No. V the constitution of the Army as regards age, and the mortality in three selected stages is given, viz. , youths, adults, and old soldiers. A glance at these figures will shew that the days when se- poys continued to serve on until they were worn out have passed away; only 10 per cent. of the men who enlist serve beyond 40 years of age; 33.4 per cent. are youths under 25 years of age; 56 per cent. are between 25 and 40. The mortali- ty exhibits a correspond- ing advance according to age, viz. , 2.18, 2.57, 3.25 per cent. respect- ively. The variations in this table between different arms of the service, and also between the several component sections of the Army, are open to so many disturbing influences that practical lessons cannot be educed from the figures.
V STATEMENT No. VI. Strength and Death-rate according to Caste. Strength. Death-rate. Hindus 45,077 2.75 Mussulmans 19,199 1.79 Christians 300 2. 16. There Were 45,077 Hindus, 19,199 Mahomedans; and 300 Christians serving in the Native Army in 1878. The mor- tality exhibits a decid- ed preponderance in re- spect of Hindus; but, as will be shown here- after, the entire ratios have in this year been unduly affected by in- dividual regimental loss- es, and it is certain that the Hindu death-rate has been seriously augmented from the great mortali- ty which occurred in the 38th Native Infantry at Barrackpore and the 14th Native Infantry at Peshawur, two regiments almost exclusively Hindu. Also, it may be admitted that many of the Bengal regiments transported to Afgha- nistan for service were at first ill prepared to withstand the rigours of the climate, and in these risks also the Hindu classes predominated. The number of Chris- tians enlisted is too small to enable any conclusions to be drawn from the statistics. Last year, for example, they were 287 strong and had not a single death registered; this year there have been 6 deaths in a strength of 300. 17. In Statement VII will be found a scale of progressive sickness and mortality according as the troops in each Command have been affected. There is considerable variation in all of them from year to year, and, moreover, it often happens that the statistics of one station or district are greatly lowered by the transfer of a sickly regiment to a more healthy locality, and, vice versâ, a healthy station may have the hospital statistics gravely augmented by the arrival of a regiment which has been a long time suffering from agues, &c., elsewhere. For example, in 1877, Meerut stood No. 10 in Table VII with an average per- centage of daily sick of only 2.8,vi STATEMENT No. VII.

vii 18. In Statements VIII and IX which follow, is exhibited the sickness and mortality as it has affected the units of the Army. These tables have now been prepared for several years, and have at all times exercised a superficial interest in ascertaining the precise condition of individual regiments; but it is certain that no scientific results can ever be drawn from this breaking up, as it were, of the general body of figures, and it is not intended to continue these tables beyond the current year. As a simple fact, the deductions go no further than the data recorded. In Table IX, for example, of 1877 we find the 4th Bengal Cavalry at Meerut to have had the cleanest bill of health in the whole service, and in 1878 the 39th Native Infantry and the 9th Bengal Cavalry are both very low indeed in the whole scale; but it may be confidently predicted that in 1879 the 38th Native Infantry at Meerut will show very nearly the worst of allViii STATEMENT No. IX.

D., availed himself of the same route to describe the physical features of the country between Sukkur and Kandahar in a very clear and intelligent manner. Similarly the novel experiences of transporting native troops of all arms to Europe was made the fitting occasion for medical observation of life on board- ship, of the various methods of sanitation, the proper quality, quantity, and variety of food, and the diseases which originated in new habits and climates. Surgeons-Major R. Mantell and C. E. Raddock have given good topographical descriptions of Malta and Cyprus. The ordinary cantonments have now been so often and thoroughly described that medical officers may fairly be excused for entering into a repetition of details. The march of the two divisions of the Khyber Field Force was accurately described by the late Surgeon-Major W. W. Galloway, M. D., 45th Regiment, Native Infantry, and Surgeon-Major S. C. Amesburgh, 6th Native Infantry. 21. The meteorological section of the various annual reports is less satis- factory. Many circumstances combine to render accurate observations, both barometrical and thermometrical, almost impossible in military hospitals, such as the frequent change of station caused by ordinary relief, by camps of exer- cise, and by active service; and even though the remove may be temporary, nevertheless it is a disturbance of all calculation for the current year, where exact records suited for scientific generalization had been begun. In past years regi- mental surgeons have not infrequently been in the habit of closely observing the natural phenomena of the climate and studying its changes, yet this cannot be persevered in when, as before explained, the changes of locality recur at such short intervals. Meteorology, as a science, is now taken up by a distinct department; for no definite results would ever have been obtained from the desultory and imperfect figures which are transmitted from Army hospitals. It should not, however, be understood that the main features of climate, as factors in the production of disease, have passed unobserved. The depressing influence of the damp and heat of Assam, the excess of rainfall at Bareilly, the flooding of the Punjab rivers, the regular mountain cold blasts of the Kur- rum valley, the excessive heat by day and bitter cold at night of the Kutch desert, the 25° of frost in the Pishin valley, have all been recorded, and their influence on the health of the troops described. It is known that the Punjab and Trans-Indus stations have been widely desolated by malarious fever at the close of the rains of 1878, and the condition of the land after the drying up of the floods, which almost surrounded Jullundur and swept away the entire canton- ment of Dera Ghazee Khan, may be fairly held accountable for its production. 22. The barrack accommodation for the sepoys is not on a proper footing. The Army Sanitary Commission's comment on the report for 1877 draws pointed attention to this. Although some "lines" are better than others, and sanitation is more cared for in some regiments than in others, yet it may be said, speaking broadly, that the dwelling-house of the native soldier is unhealthy from top to bottom. The flooring, as a rule, is excavated instead of being raised; at Peshawur the medical officers describe it as on a level with the irrigation channels, which scour the cantonments in every direction; in the Eastern Frontier district the Deputy Surgeon-General has repeatedly pointed out the mistake of having the floors dug out to build the walls. There are doorways alone, and the ventilation is always imperfect. Even before the present increase to the strength of regiments, the principal medical officers have in several instances, notably at Meean Meer, spoken of over-crowding as plainly productive of disease, and it will therefore be most injudicious to put up the 800 sepoys of the pre- sent regiment in the same lines in which 600 have hitherto been accommodated. But as regards the men on field service there does not seem much ground of objection. The "lascar" form of pâl-tent is recommended by medical officers as most suitable for Afghanistan, chiefly on account of its portability and the more complete shelter which it affords to small detached bodies of men. The half pâl of the sepoys' common tent is a miserable shelter against either heat by day or cold by night. The 21st Native Infantry had bell tents issued on first marching to Kurrum, and found them most inconvenient. 23. The drainage of military cantonments may be dismissed with a very few remarks. It is entirely "surface" in every one of them, and the c
X rapid depletion of surface rainfall is rather a result of happy accident than of reliable construction. The area is too immense to be sensibly corrected even by such extensive improvements as have lately been carried out in the Meerut district; nor is it by any means sufficient to drain localities by a rapid surface outfall, for this leads to torrents in the river, and this again to back-flow and overflow beyond. The medical history, both of 1878 and 1879, proves, unfortu- nately too conclusively, that local surface drainage is no remedy at all against a general prevalence of malaria, and the localities which are drained show a very trifling, if any, advantage in their sickness and mortality over those which lie beyond. 24. The conservancy of cantonments has remained unchanged in its general regulations; but it is very doubtful if in practice the trench system is so thoroughly adopted as it ought to be. The medical reports show that the prac- tice of sepoys "resorting to the jungle" is still far from uncommon, notwith- standing its well-understood baleful influence both on the air and water. On the other hand, in stations which are more immediately under inspection, every- thing is being carried out in as perfect a manner as the circumstances will permit. There can be no question about the excellence of the system of shallow trenches and cultivation; the difficulty lies in its universal application and efficient attention to details. The instincts and habits of the natives lead them in all cases to prefer a resort to waste or arable land for purposes of nature; but the Mosaic rules for deodorization will never be observed by individuals without control. Roorkee, for example, may be instanced as a station where for many years the right system was neglected, and the wrong one permitted under vari- ous excuses; "there was no ground available," "there were no sufficient funds," "the nullahs only were used, and these answered all the purposes of trenches," &c., &c. Now, under an active Magistrate, the same station is quoted as the pattern of excellence; there was no difficulty in extending cantonment limits; the land trenched pays; and the natives prefer the cleanliness and convenience secured by them just as Europeans would. 25. There does not appear to have been sufficiently careful carrying-out of the trench system in the many camping grounds which marked the routes of the several divisions composing the Army of Afghanistan. Whether the hurried preparation and advance, or the lack of servants, or the distraction of more pressing needs, or the helplessness of the crowd, or all combined, rendered sani- tation on the road hopeless, is not stated; but all the medical reports mention the condition of the camping grounds in terms of melancholy presage of future disease. Of course the standing camps at Kandahar, Jellalabad and Kurrum were placed under the trench system; but Afghanistan is an un- favourable locality generally for its adoption from the contracted limits of the camps, the nature of the soil, and the enemy ever lurking to murder on the outskirts. Urinals are not so generally provided regimentally as they should be. It seems reasonable that every cantonment should be provided with such accessories to the comfort and cleanliness of the soldier. The Sappers and Miners have one in each company, described in the annual report for 1874. It is constructed at a very trifling cost and maintained at no extra expense. 26. So much has been written on the inestimable value of a pure water- supply in India, so many advantages have followed its introduction in some places, and so many disasters have followed the neglect of proper precautions in providing it, that little remains to be said on the subject. In the report for last year allusion was made to the importance of having periodical analysis of water prepared, and it was suggested that this could be better carried out if special bottles were forwarded to the several Chemical Examiners for report. But to this I have objected. Efficiency must be combined with economy; and it would be doing scant justice to the careful practical education in water ana- lysis which medical officers have undergone previous to entering the service, if from the day they entered it, the duty was entirely taken from them and placed in the hands of officials who, however experienced and skilful, could have neither local judgment nor responsibility. My obligations are due to Mr. Wood, late Chemical Examiner to the Government of Bengal, for his aid in devising, at my suggestion, the apparatus and re-agents necessary for a rough and ready analysis of water. There will soon be a supply of these chemical cabinets ready
xi for issue at the medical depôt, and it is intended that on every occasion of an epidemic, or long-continued sickness at a station, the medical officers of the troops there are to be required to submit an analysis of the water-supply. In Assam the Deputy Surgeon-General and the medical officers, both civil and military, are using their best endeavours to promote the only proper form in which water should be available for domestic use, viz., tapped at a source of comparative purity, conveyed for distribution in covered channels, and protected from local contamination. But it happens here, as elsewhere, that the perver- sity of the people, their indolence or ignorance defeats the best efforts for their welfare; and it is reported that they are inveterate to use the polluted stagnant tanks about their dwellings rather than carry the pure water from the hydrants to their doors. In Dacca the extension of the town filtered-water to cantonments has not been carried out, if indeed the water-works are as vet efficient in the town alone, and the Medical Officer, 10th Native Infantry, at Dacca, has been at some pains to arrange a floating filter in the river itself which will supply com- paratively pure drinking and cooking water to the garrison. The water-supply at Peshawur remains in the same state of open courses. 27. As regards the troops in the field, there is abundant evidence that they have had to undergo every variety and risk in drinking water: absolute want in the Sind desert; water bitter, brackish, saltish, with chlorides, sulphates, nitrates; water which had been stagnant and loaded with solids; water bright, sparkling and pure from the melted snow. At one place, Ali Musjid, the water was said to carry antimony in solution; but I conjecture that the peculiar colic which ensued in drinking it was more the result of initiation to cold rations and snow water than to metalloid, salts. At all events, the existence of antimony in the Khyber river water at Ali Musjid has not been chemically demonstrated, and the suspicion of it has died away since the garrison has been supplied with better food and cooking. Some attempts have been made by medical officers to filter running water roughly by means of storage tanks in the stony river-courses. Surgeon-Major Chesnaye contrived in this way to obtain clear water for drinking, at Jumrood, apart from the stream commonly used by transport animals and followers. The brackish water in the Kutch district was so loaded with salines that vegetables were with difficulty cooked, and the dhall which was issued to the native troops was harder after half an hour's boiling than when first put in. The water-supply along the new route viâ Thull Chotiali is reported to have been very bad at many of the camps. 28. The diet of the native troops under circumstances where all food required transport and necessitated the supply of every trifle which helps to stimulate appetite or aid digestion has occupied the attention of the medical officers of the Army. Unfortunately regiments seem to have been so differently placed to procure extras, and circumstanced as regards general health, climate and medical recommendations, that it is difficult to define a single ration which could be recommended to all. In the Eastern Frontier districts the excessive price of milk is regretted, and its want as an article of food dwelt upon; rice is very expensive also, and were it not for potatoes the Assam regiments would be in a bad way. Although in the cantonments of the settled provinces nothing has occurred regarding the food-supply of the native troops which requires special notice, the year was one of high prices generally, caused alike by a deficient harvest and the drain of food staples to the North-Western Frontier. The question whether a sepoy stints himself in food below what is necessary for a soldier's duty may now, I consider, be pronounced settled. The enquiry has lasted through some years and under many aspects, and the result points clearly to the opinion that while individual sepoys, under special inducement of saving, penury, and possibly religion, do stint their appetite, the great body of men do not. Indeed, it may be stated that the regimental checks to underfeed- ing are now so complete that such a practice is impossible, except among indi- viduals. In those instances where a whole regiment (improbable in itself) has been reported to be sickly from underfeeding, the real explanation, as in the 38th Native Infantry, is, that the men cannot eat their usual diet in full, simply from their sickly state of health; and that the medical history has preceded, and not followed, the use of small rations. 29. The history of the expedition of native troops in transports to the Mediterranean during the year gives full details of the food-supply on board-
xii ship. Every account represent both quantity and variety as good and sufficient. The only circumstance which has not been quite explained, but which was said to have arisen from the diet on boardship, was the prevalence of a low form of inflammation, affecting the mouth and soft-palate, which appeared among both the troops and followers of the Contingent soon after its arrival at Malta. The cases were not serious, and the medical enquiry as to its origin seemed to refer the disease rather to surfeit of food and want of sufficient exercise. There was no evidence of ergotized grain, nor of parasitic growth in the ulcers which broke out on the gums, teeth, tongue, and lips. It was certainly not of a scorbutic type, though all were advised by the Maltese to eat oranges for their cure. 30. As regards the rations which were issued to the Native Army and camp followers who had crossed the frontier, the medical opinions regarding their merits and sufficiency vary a good deal, a result which is chiefly due to the many experiences of service and the different races of men composing the invading force. For example, the Surgeon-Major of the 4th Goorkhas states that the physique of the men was certainly improved by free rations, and the Surgeon-Major of the 1st Goorkhas concurs in this view and suggests as an explanation that many of the married men do certainly not get the same quantity of food when in quarters with their families. The 15th Native Infantry "has had good food throughout the year; on the march from Lahore to Mooltan large quantities of milk and mutton were obtained at cheap rates" (R. W. Cun- ningham, M.D.): "Government rations fairly liberal, supplemented by working pay and purchase of fowls, eggs, goats, vegetables, when procurable (E. Tayler, 23rd Native Infantry) "Rations ample, followers and kahars grow fat on them" (Surgeon W. E. Griffiths, 21st Native Infantry). On the other hand, Sur- geon H. Boyd considers the rations insufficient and not enough variety (14th Native Infantry). Surgeon-Major H. N. Keefer is of the same opinion; while Surgeon Lewtas, 27th Native Infantry, after a very careful and close enquiry, considers the flour is in excess, and that a meat ration is, to a wide extent, indispensable to troops across the North-Western Frontier. 30. Many diseases appear to be contracted from the habit of cooking food hastily, or eating it when cold and sodden. The natives drink water too largely, and often crave for the indulgence of tea, sugar, tobacco or opium to allay sub- sequent indigestion. Army medical officers are commonly of opinion that the issue of rations should in future be universal, and that an increase of efficiency would result, especially if to this system were superadded the insti- tution of messes with one cook to each section. It appears that this was really tried in the 13th Native Infantry on boardship, and was also successful at Malta and Cyprus (Surgeon W. R. Murphy). The quality of the rations is not complained of except that the atta had occasionally an excess of bran; but this was found to be due rather to careless filling of bags than to the quality of the supply. The want of milk and vegetables was always much felt, scurvy did not exist in any regiment to an appreciable degree except as a concomitant of general ill-health,xiii it may be said that a native of Hindustan if sent on service into Kabul should have had as ample an allowance of body clothing and bedding as a European, especially when the larger share of night duties falls to the lot of the former. The peculiar feature of the climate is intense range of the thermometer, and the most effective protection would be found in wool next to the skin. But the reports show that many regiments from the plains of India, having hurried to the seat of war in advance of the commissariat supplies, had not received, when the severe cold set in, the supply of jerseys, suits, socks, and poshteens which had been sanctioned for free issue; and the great prevalence of agues, especially on the route to Southern Afghanistan, was ascribed by medical officers mainly to exposure to night air and extreme cold when insufficiently clad. While several medical officers consider that the regulated 20 lbs. allowed to each sepoy for baggage is too small, others give a distinct opinion as to its sufficiency. On this subject it is desirable that a more definite report should be issued; the statements are inconsistent. In the 5th Goorkhas the carriage as- signed is considered too little for warmth and health (Surgeon-Major Farrell), while the medical officer, 1st Sikh Infantry (Surgeon-Major A. P. Holmes), with a very high rate of sickness and mortality, considers the "clothing ample, no further improvement necessary." 27th Native Infantry, "Two blanketsneces- sary." 7th Native Infantry, "Undress clothing insufficient." 23rd Native In- fantry, "Great coats and caps exceptionally good, otherwise one blanket and one durrie not sufficient" (Surgeon-Major E. Tayler). The conclusion which I have come to, though it is one which I should expect modified by further evi- dence, is this, that 10 seers of baggage for each sepoy is ample in all cavalry regiments in the service, and in the infantry of the Punjab Frontier Force, in which experience of climate and possibly a little help in regimental carriage, enable the native soldier to add to his uniform a poshteen or a choga, to his undress a wadded "meerzaie," and to his bedding a wadded "razaie." In the regular infantry some regiments are better equipped than others, the great coats are longer, the blankets are heavier, the carriage possibly is not closely checked. If, however, the proportion of carriage laid down in Quarter Master General's "Revised Cabul Scale" is rigidly observed, and the 10 seers include the extra free clothing in G. O. C. C. of 1st October 1879, then I should certainly consider the proportion available for bedding as too small for that climate. It is a really important question, and one which has an especial significance in the liability of the native troops to attacks of ague; and the value of ample and good clothing in keeping the men fit for duty has been nowhere more thoroughly established than in the hospital records of the troops serving in Afghanistan. 32. On the vexed question of boots much has been written, and opinions are still widely at variance. It is indeed almost impossible that any single pattern of boot should answer equally well in the jungle tracts of Assam, the swamps of Bengal, the level roads of Hindustan, the sandy wastes of Belu- chistan, or the rocky defiles and towering passes of Kabul. I notice that many Commanding Officers are prompt to modify or change the boot as the service varies, and in nearly all cases some useful hint in this respect may be learnt from the people of the invaded country. The Guides Infantry use the Afghan "chaplie " largely, and "have fewer admissions from sore feet than any other regiment in the service" (Surgeon J. Lewtas, M. B.). The native shoe, which has so many advocates, was found to fill with sand at every step in the desert and to cause cracks beneath the toes, across the heels, and where the edges brushed the opposite ankles. The use of puttis is much advocated in preference to gaiters. The long boots in the cavalry render them almost helpless when dis- mounted in the hills and defiles of Kabul. The ammunition boot, with a broad tongue and with strap and buckle, seems to have been most serviceable. There is, a very general admission as to its superiority for all purposes if only socks are worn with it; but unfortunately this implies either frequent mending or peri- odical replacement, and neither can be relied on. The drawbacks of the ammu- nition boot are, its manufacture of inferior country leather, the bad cut, and its rough hardness at first. If improvements could be effected in the tanning so as to supply a soft and yet durable leather, and equal attention paid to the fit as to a coat (the latter far less important of the two), and the soldier saved from rough duty the first time they are worn, it is likely that no reasonable complaints d

It too often happens that a regiment is newly equipped With boots and. makes the first march before even they have been sodden- ed with grease. Some of the regiments of the Kandahar divisions are reported to have march- ed their boots off, and were some time without any. It is remarkable that certain regiments which have always. had a share in every field service seem to be even more subject to " blis- tered feet" than others. In Table No. X the figures of admissions from this disease alone show the great increase of the year and the large numbers of men who are incapacitated for duty from this cause. 33. The duties of the troops have been most varied during the year, and have ensured a high state of discipline in the Army. The engagement of the Punjab Frontier Force and several regiments of the regular army in Jowaki, the expedition of a combined force of 14,000 men of all arms to the Mediterranean, and the assembly of an army to cross the North-Western Frontier, have given ample opportunity to test the moral and physical stamina of the native soldier by throwing on him for many months a serious strain of duty; and, in addition, the exceptionally high sick list, not only in the field, but also among regiments who had continued to garrison cantonments has kept the few who escaped fever constantly on duty. In some instances, where the regiments had not been long under the depress- ing influence of malaria, the march on service produced a favourable effect (8th Bengal Cavalry, 1st Punjab Cavalry), but in the majority, especially those which had been long in the Peshawur Valley, the exposure and privation led to a very high rate of sickness and mortality. The experience of nearly all the regiments has been the same, that pneumonia is most prevalent and most deadly when it attacks those who have a previous history of ague, and that of all other duties, night picket is, as might be expected, the most predisposing. Regi- ments which marched as escort to convoys had the additional labour of loading and unloading camels twice daily, and the weight of accoutrements and ball ammunition (33 lbs., 5th Goorkhas) seems to have told heavily on all who were weakly from fever. The regiments which remained in Peshawur had harassing duties (the 7th Native Infantry, 22nd Native Infantry, 17th Bengal Cavalry), and all had a high sick-rate. The. 38th Native Infantry had such a large number always in hospital that those who were able to remain on duty felt the effects. The remarks of the medical officers are briefly such as these: 14th Native Infantry, "Hardly a night in bed" (Surgeon H. Boyd). 27th Native Infantry, "Barely two nights a week in bed" (Surgeon J. Lewtas, M.B.). 17th Bengal Cavalry, "Severe duty and exposure added greatly to the sick list (Surgeon D. P. Macdonald). 2nd Punjab Cavalry, "Night duty is the sole explanation of the higher ratio of sickness and mortality which affected the fighting men as compared with poorly clad and worse-fed follow- ers" (Surgeon J. C. Macartie). It is impossible to enter into suggestions in the face of important military necessities; but the remarks quoted will give potency to recommendations of the principal medical officers in the field to provide shelter for the native soldier at the earliest possible date, and to save him from excessive night-guard. 34.The gymnastic drill, the amusements, school and recreation of the Native Army have been reduced to a very low ebb during the current year. Wherever the brave Goorkhas march, at Jellalabad or at Shillong, their fishing is never forgotten, and the pleasure which these valuable soldiers take in passing their time off duty in sport of one form or another might well be imitated by
XV other classes, European and Native alike. The 16th Bengal Cavalry continue to have a school of arms, and the growth of the recruits and their muscular development following exercise are registered The 34th Native Infantry at Cachar do the same. The Central India Horse, who have occupied their stations undisturbed through the year have, as usual, shared largely in the annual fête of tiger-slaying; and regiments of Bengal Cavalry, with leisure to do so, practise feats of horsemanship which advantage them so much in real war; but gardening is not a success, except on a small scale in Assam. 35. In my report for the year 1877 I concluded the remarks on Native Army hospitals by the welcome statement that "within late years many salu- tary changes have taken place in hospital construction and arrangement which must greatly enhance the comfort of the sick, and contribute materially to their recovery." And it is satisfactory to observe that through all the regi- mental reports of 1878 which refer to these buildings there are few and unimportant objections. It is desirable that most of them should have a par- tially glazed door for comfort in the cold season; the fire-places are in many instances of the rudest construction, often filling the ward with smoke, to the distress of patients who are ill from respiratory diseases; and the incomplete- ness of out-buildings is still reported in some stations: but these details are not of primary importance and might easily be remedied by local energy. I am more concerned with the condition of hospitals in the field. It has been strongly urged that the ordinary 'pâl' should be discontinued for hospital use in hill warfare except when a field or depôt hospital is estab- lished and likely to remain at one post. For regiments the substitution of the lascar 'pâl' is advocated as being lighter, easily carried, struck and pitched; and especially as obviating that inconvenience of service in a cold climate, the "half" pâl when divided for detachments. Some of the regiments appear to have had this particular equipment and to have been satisfied. The 3rd Goorkhas took six to Kandahar; in each twelve men might find room, but usually only eight. In addition to straw the sick appear to have been allowed to use as bedding the 'jhules' or warm covers of dead camels. Everywhere on service, where a halt admits of it, the tents are banked about with stones and mud, the earth inside trenched to allow the recumbent figure more ease, a bolster of withes runs from end to end as a pillow support, and a fire-place with an underground chimney built to the end. Many medical officers write of the hos- pital blankets which were given by Government as having proved most grateful and "saved many lives." 36. Many other details of hospital equipment have received extended notice; but it is necessary to abridge them in recapitulation. The "field com- panions" have obtained unqualified praise. It is not easy to devise such a medicine chest as can accommodate itself to all descriptions of carriage and to travel over every road to be found in Afghanistan, but the mule trunks have answered their purpose fairly well. It is doubtful if they are often so lightly loaded as to be a mule's burden; but they are fitted with every medical and surgical appliance usually called for in the field; and there can be no doubt that in durability and ready access to contents they are very serviceable. 37. Surgeon J. Lewtas, M.B., who has succeeded the late lamented Sur- geon A. H. Kelly, as medical officer of the Guide Corps, contrives to carry his entire hospital on mules alone, the tents keeping up with the column in rear of the sick carriage. Hence, on arrival at a camping ground the sick speedily obtain shelter. Such a practice, if generally introduced, would save the sick from the discomfort and risk of being turned out of bed in the bitter early mornings when the camp is struck for two hours before starting, and similarly from exposure in all weathers, while waiting for the camels and tents to arrive at the end of the march. 38. Of the various descriptions of carriage which have been employed in the transport of sick and wounded, all have been subjected to severe practical trials; and it seems that all have had serious complaints against their efficiency. The "bearers" have too often been found more fit to be carried than to carry the sick; too debilitated to bear up against the hard work and exposure which befell them. The kahars furnished by the Punjab, and especially from Seal- kote, were of better stamina and more useful; the same class of natives in the North-Western Provinces has had their occupation taken away by improved
xvi methods of travel and have become charcoal-burners, or tillers of the soil, but certainly no longer bearers. A large proportion were so reduced by fever, and weak from want, that they fell an early prey to sickness themselves. It is, however, their due that a kindly word should be said of the performance of their duty to the best of their ability; in many instances it amounted almost to devotion; many of them were cruelly murdered by the enemy; they were too often neglected in the ordinary necessaries of life, shelter, food, pay, warmth, and clothes, and were always under requisition for work. The intentions of Government towards them were most benevolent; their value was fully recog- nised, and their nominal pay most liberal; but they had no organization; they were continually being shuffled and lost sight of, and the strong and the weak inextricably confused for an equal burden. The medical officers in the field are unanimous in suggesting that some definite plans of drill and discipline should be substituted for the present unmilitary state of affairs, and I cannot better illustrate the individual energy and intelligence of regimental surgeons than by copying the following extracts from the narrative of the march of the 15th Loodhiana Sikhs from Sealkote to Kandahar by Surgeon-Major R. W. Cun- ningham, M.D., an officer of distinguished good service:xvii of fevers being 57.4 in 1878, while dysentery, the next highest disease of a defined type, gives only 7.02 injuries, which include the wounded, coming third with 4.7. At the opposite end of the scale it is worthy of note that phthisis gives less than two in 1,000 of admissions in the army, the majority being in Ghoorkha regiments, and cholera also gave exactly the same proportion. Res- piratory diseases were high, and diarrhxviii 42. Of the special epidemic of ague which prevailed in 1878, the medical officers of the Army give no novel description. Its origin is commonly ascribed to the heavy rainfall, the flooding of rivers, swamps and inundations, and sub- sequent exhalation. It was most widely prevalent through the Punjab, although in absolute sick rate no regiments suffered more largely from the disease than the 38th Native Infantry at Barrackpore and Meerut, and the 41st Native Infantry at Gwalior (Morar). The medical history of both has been fully described in former annual reports. The 38th Native Infantry has unfortunately, since its arrival at Meerut, had to experience a second malari- ous influence which has been so widely distributed over the North-West Pro- vinces during the present year. The health of the troops which were sent to Malta remained very good until they were transferred to Cyprus later in the autumn, when all the regiments, more particularly those stationed at Larnaka, contracted malarious ague largely, and retained it till long after their return to India. The medical officers of the 13th Native Infantry, writing from Agra in January of the present year, considered the Cyprus ague as peculiar, its bilious symptons being very marked, and the relapses obstinately frequent; but the general evidence leaves little doubt that the modifications of malarious ague were not greater in Cyprus than may be met with in widely separated districts of India itself. 43. It is perhaps unnecessary to remark that the 13th, 38th, 41st, 31st and many frontier regiments are only exaggerated instances of a type of disease which has been almost universal. The percentage of admissions shows how general it has been, while the primary mortality is little higher than that of previous years. In 10,000 admissions from fevers, there died 32, 46, 28, 43, 50 from 1874 to 1879 respectively; but if the intimate relation recog- nised to exist between a malarious taint of constitution and the liability to pneumonia is considered, it is evident that the secondary mortality from bron chitis, from splenic affections and from dysentery is a very serious matter, and one which is apt to be lost sight of when the figures of ague alone are taken into account; and from the annexed statement, No. XIII, the proportions of admissions and deaths from pneumonia and allied respiratory disease shows a very grave increase in both the number and the mortality of admissions. I repeat that the explanation of the large increase is to be found in the great number of men who, with a taint of malaria, had to face exposure in the field in a country especially trying to men accustomed to the plains of India, and under circumstances which often found them ill-protected against the cold; and that the real significance of this large augmentation of respiratory disease can never be properly appreciated except in reference to the previous medical history of many of the regiments and the climate of Kabul combined. Good cloth- ing, good food, and a sound constitution are all essential to a native of Hindus- tan rendering efficient service in Afghanistan. STATEMENT No. XIII.

In 1877 the presence of cholera throughout the Army was at the lowest figure which it has reached for many years; but in 1878 the admis- sions were more fre- quent than in any year since 1872. This was chiefly due to a remark- ably violent epidemic occurring in a strong de- tachment of the 41st Native Infantry which left Morar cantonments in the early part of May to escort treasure from Dholpore Railway ter- minus. On their way back the escort was caught twice on the march in heavy dust storms followed by rain, and on the 13th, the day it reached the old resi- dency, the epidemic burst out. It had the usual ten days' duration, and by the 23rd. had disappeared, 115 cases and 58 deaths taking place in the interval. Very clear narratives of this outbreak, which unfortunately do not explain the origin of the epidemic, have been contributed by the medical officers to the Sanitary Department, and by the Deputy Assistant Quarter-Master General of the district. Eliminating the figures of the Gwalior epidemic from those of the whole year, there were only 54 cases and 29 deaths, these being wholly confined to regiments serving in the Eastern Frontier, the Presidency and the Agra circles.

Gonorrhxxi sugar would be a healthful addition, but a special ration for the sick in hospital is undoubtedly required. Surgeon-Major Oldham, of the 1.st Ghoorkha Regiment, presses this point with much earnestness. Indeed, the followers have from the first obtained rice and milk instead of flour and ghee; and all sick native soldiers should get it. Tea is frequently granted as a hospital ration and is not only very grateful, but most proper in the treatment of most diseases. The "poshteen," a sheep's skin overcoat, is eminently desirable to be generally adopted on service; some regiments have it as a part of their regular uniforms and found increased protection from respiratory disease and fevers; to those who had it not a certain proportion for general use on night duties was allowed. 49. The most important of the special observations which have occurred during the year is undoubtedly the lamentable poisoning of some troopers of the 9th Bengal Cavalry at Malta by the issue of Burnett's disinfecting fluid instead of lime-juice. The circumstances which brought about this deplorable mistake have been minutely detailed in the annual report of the regiment, and, since a court-of-inquiry and subsequently a lengthened correspondence has satisfied the Government of India that it was caused more by accident than by care- lessness, it is perhaps enough for me to mention here that I have issued the most precise instructions that in future all bottles containing poison shall have their distinctive labels written in both English and vernacular, and that medical officers cannot divest themselves of responsibility if no examination of their contents has been made before they have been issued medicinally. 50. The substitution of cinchona febrifuge in considerable quantities for quinine has been continued in all the native military hospitals throughout the year; and I am glad to observe that its efficacy in a very large proportion of the ordinary climatic fevers is generally admitted. By a recent resolution of the Bengal Government, the manufacture of the commercial sulphates of quinine, cinchonine, and cinchonidine is to be commenced on a large scale; and it is hoped that these, combined as a mixed sulphate, will, without a very material increase of cost, form a febrifuge equally efficacious without the disagreable nauseating effects which have hitherto obviated the universal use of the drug in place of quinine. 51. In a memorandum, No. 84, dated India Office, 10th July 1879, forward- ing a review by the Army Sanitary Commission of my Report on the Native Army for 1877, the Right Honourable the Secretary of State desires that especial attention shall be given to the increased prevalence of chest diseases in India. I have already adduced what I consider to be the measures best calculated to protect the native soldiers and camp followers from the attacks of these diseases, viz., woollen body clothing of good quality, less night duty if possible, and early removal from extreme cold of regiments which are infected with malaria. The first of these palliatives has already been sanctioned by the Government, but the other two must wait the cessation of hostilities. At the time of writing the present report, I have the satisfaction to observe that the health of the troops in Cabal has greatly improved, and it is hoped that, with the disappearance of the autumnal fevers and the careful hutting and clothing of regiments, pneu- monia will be averted. 52. I do not propose to answer in detail the other suggestions which have been put forward by the Army Sanitary Commission as improvements to the hygiene of the Native Army. Some of them are already discussed in the body of this report; some involve far too great an expenditure to he thought of at the present moment; and others are inopportune when the greater portion of the Native Army is in the field, and duty has first to be considered. But the observations of the Sanitary Commission have had my best consideration, and I shall endeavour at a fitting time to place them before the Government of India in such a shape as may secure for them not only approval generally, but also the likelihood of their being carried out. 53. In this, the fifth report, which I have had the honour of submitting to His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General in Council, and the last which will be submitted by me, I crave permission to bring most prominently under notice the fidelity, humanity, zeal, and ability of the Officers of the Indian. Medical Service. I believe it to be simply impossible for any body of men to endeavour to perform their duty to the State with greater strictness, or more sterling honesty; and after nearly 5 years' experience of their work, I consider
xxii myself justified in adding, with more successful and beneficial results. I trust they will ever strive to merit, as in the past, the confidence of those committed. to their charge, and to deserve the approbation of the Government of India. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, J. FULLARTON BEATSON, M. D., Surgeon-General, I. M. Dept.

It is a mud fort, about 400 yards square, with walls of great thickness. There are rows of mud barracks built into the walls; these are occupied by: the troops. When the place was first taken possession of, there were a number of broken-down buildings in the middle of the square. These were pulled down, and the materials used for filling up unsightly holes, which disfigured the place and would doubtless have added to its insalubrity. On the southern side of the fort, where the chief gateway is situated, a small part of the square is divided from the rest by a wall and row of huts. In this part the bazar is located and the baggage animals are picketed. Diet. IX.

The rest are with the Commissariat, and would be supplied on indent if the regiment were ordered to march. There does not appear to have been much care taken in the selection of the kahars. Many of them are old men scarcely able to crawl, and quite unfit for service. I think four kahars quite unequal to carry a dandy with a sick man in a hilly country. In the second Bazaar expedition six kahars were allowed for each dandy, and were certainly required. All the kahars and camp- followers were provided by Government with a posteen, a warm pair of drawers, a blanket, and a pair of puttees. They are also supplied with tents. I am not aware if there has been much sickness amongst them. There certainly has not been any since I joined. 36th (The Bareillg) Regt., Nat. Infy.5 PRESIDENCY DISTRICT. Inspection.

The ex- cessive mortality is readily explained by the physical exhaustion to which the men were reduced by such a long continued exposure. There was nothing neces- sarily fatal either in the character of the sickness or its intensity. It was the time to which they were exposed to the noxious influences. No doubt the men presented the appearance of being underfed, because to most of them healthy appetite and digestion had long been unknown. Dr. Thorp's closing remarks refer to the improved health of the men as seen after four months' change of station to Meerut.

Alinagar still gives the largest ratio of admission and daily average sick, and is evidently a very unhealthy post. The mortality in the regiment was nearly equal to that of last year. Two cases of cholera at Chargola and a case of tiger-bite at Shillong reduce the amount to be attributed to the health statistics of the regiment. The large number invalided arose from the fact that there were two committees during the year, the annual date of the committee for Assam regiments having. been changed. A curious epidemic of dropsy occurred in the latter part of the year, attacking civil and military residents at Shillong alike, for which no cause can be assigned. It somewhat resembles beri-beri, except that it is rarely fatal. The whole course of the disease is being thoroughly investigated at present. Nearly all cases observed in the regiment were scorbutic.

XIII. Marches and service.EASTERN FRONTIER, DISTRICT. 27 for 13 cases, There were 80 cases of febricula, i.e ., of ordinary feverish cold. These cases were readily distinguishable from ague by the absence of the cold stage of spleen compli- cation and of the general appearance of malarial cachexy. The history of each case and the temperature also furnished a sure guide to a correct diagnosis. A very large proportion of the fever and dysentery was no doubt due to the recent change of the regiment from the plains to the hills. The men were readily subject to chill, and attacks of ague and dysentery were the result. Now that the men are acclimatised by a year's residence in Shillong I expect the sick rate in 1879 will be much reduced. Still, notwithstanding the recent change from the plains the health of the men in Shillong has been fairly good, the admission rate being. only 128, and the death rate 1.8 per cent. The men of the regiment are chiefly hillmen, 650 out of 850, or about 70 per cent being Goorkhas; they are therefore, unlike Sikhs and Up- countrymen, eminently suited to this climate. Many cases of ague occurred amongst men who had recently joined from furlough or leave in the plains. In fact, a journey between Shillong. and Gauhati in the rains is inevitably followed by an attack of either malarial fever or dy- sentery.

In consequence of the floods polluting water-supply and creat- ing vast swamps, bowel disorders and malarial fevers were prevalent during the rains, and con- tinued into the cold weather to an unusual extent; while the enhanced price of provisions probably assisted in producing liability to anæmia and disorders of all kinds.

Most of the men are Goorkhas, and these probably consumed their rations of atta, together with some rice, habitu- ally. Some of the men, probably most of the Jerwahs (who are rice-eaters like most Assam- ese), having drawn their ration of atta on a cheap scale from the Commissariat, accumulate it and sell it at enhanced rates to the bunniahs, and thus consume their rice with profit to themselves. The Goorkha as a rule lives well, and underfeeding as an economic resource does not to any extent prevail in this wing. Besides the regimental bazar, the station bazars have ample supplies of all kinds for sale. The numerous cases of anæmia were not due to scurvy, but to the general depression, enervation and feebleness of organic functions which Europeans and natives alike suffer from during the hot months in this damp malarious climate.

There is no doubt that the spleen tissue was ruptured at the time of the accident, but that the dense thickened capsule remained entire. The man lived for three days, when from distention of spleen substance from hæmorrhage the capsule burst on the fourth day; the capsule had become softened in the parts which ultimately gave way. The accident was caused during exercise, after a heavy meal of rice, in the gymnasium. The man slipped on the horizontal bar and fell with his left side against the bar; the spleen was evidently crushed between the bar on one side and the hard stomach full of rice on the other. One man died of abscess of liver. While on duty, some months before, with a survey party in the hills, he had evidently suffered from suppurative inflammation of liver (returned as ague by the hospital assistant); nearly three months after this illness he returned to Gauhati, and was admitted for abscess of liver. While I was watching for indications of its exact site with a view to operating, the abscess ruptured on the man's turning in bed one day, and he sud- denly died. The third death was from anæmia; he had been on furlough, away from his corps, and had been ill for some months. He returned in an almost dying condition from exhaustion of anæmia, was at once admitted, but died the next day. XVIII.

The river water too was very muddy owing to the season, and superadded to these drawbacks. More than one break-down occurred in the transports, causing further delay and difficulty. Owing to the high heat in the hold of the flat too, some of the provisions went bad, and had to be replaced. In consequence of these disadvantages the general health of the regiment broke down before reaching Allahabad, and it continued very sickly for about a month after its arrival there.

In consultation with the Officer Commanding and the District Engineer Officers, various proposals have been considered for the adoption of the best and most immediate mode which can be devised to mitigate this deficiency. The one, which seems to find most favor, is to deepen and enlarge a well situated near the Nek-Chal tank, and about 800 or 1,000 yards from the lines, into which the water from the tank may percolate. This, however, at the best, seems only a make-shift arrangement, and a much more satisfactory one, though involving considerably more expense, would appear to be the construction of an aqueduct with head-works from the river Bun as, which, in a direct line westwards, flows within little more than three miles from the station.

Inspection. MEERUT DIVISION. 71 2 officers, 42 fighting-men, in medical charge of Surgeon Brereton; whilst some details and ponies were put on board a native craft. At the time of starting, the destination of the regiment was unknown. Had it been necessary to land in an enemy's country, and at once take the field, the necessary equipment for each separate body of men in each ship would have been faulty to a degree, as no one ship contained its complement of baggage, baggage animals, or followers. As far, however, as medical arrangements were concerned, each ship had a medical officer or qualified medical subordinate, for whose use medicines and medical comforts were separately supplied by the Bombay medical authorities. All the ships left Bombay during the 3rd of May, and after a slow but prosperous voyage reached Malta on the first week of June, the only occurrence of any note on the journey being that, in consequence of high winds and heavy seas in the Red Sea, the native craft with 80 baggage animals went adrift, but fortunately was able to make for Jeddah, where it was found and whence it was subsequently towed to Malta. Free rations were issued to fighting-men and followers on board ship; these consisted of rice 1 lb. or flour 1 lb. 4 oz., dhal and potatoes 4 oz., on alternate days, ghee 1 oz., salt 1 oz., sugar 2 oz., firewood 2 lbs., water 1 gallon. The followers received three-fourths of this ration. The men were allowed to take a few sheep with them, and thus had a small quantity of meat about twice a week; and after the ships had lett harbour eight days or so, lime-juice was issued every second or third day. On board one ship, in which the doolie bearers were conveyed, dry rations only were issued. viz. , parched gram or rice (powa), sugar, onions, tamarind. ghee and salt. For cooking purposes there were four cabooses (on the main deck of each ship), each about 6 ft. X 5ft. x 4ft., lined with tin. Cooking was only permitted during certain hours of the day, and every care was taken to prevent accident by fire. Great attention was paid through- out the voyage to keep the ships in as good a sanitary condition as possible, by frequent sweep- ings and cleanings, by the use of numerous windsails, and by disinfectants and deodorants freely scattered about the decks, &c., and the men were encouraged to bathe frequently. Most of the horses were placed between decks. All litter was collected and flung overboard, and the boards were scraped and brushed and freely strewn with McDougall's powder. Every third day, however, the decks were flushed with salt water, which flowed into the bilge (carrying with it a certain amount of litter and urine), and was thence pumped out of the ship. This plan was adopted in all the ships, and towards the end of the voyage the bilge-water so pumped out was naturally very offensive. Indeed this method of keeping a ship (conveying horses) clean is faulty. No refuse matter of any kind should be allowed to flow into the hold. All litter and urine should be collected and soaked up with mops and at once thrown overboard. The system of cleansing should be a dry one, that is to say, scraping and brushing, and the deck on which horses stand should rarely be flushed with salt water. On the return voyage, this dry plan was carried out, and with eminent success. Latrines for the troops consisted of wooden cages hung over the bulwarks on either side. They answered this purpose, and were easily kept clean. The supply of water was good and free from impurities, and was fairly plentiful throughout the voyage. On the 4th of June, the last ship of the expeditionary force reached Malta. On the 6th, the head-quarters of the 9th Bengal Cavalry disembarked, and with the assistance of carriage, provided by the local Government, marched 3½ miles and encamped with the rest of the regiment at a spot called San Antonio alongside the 1st Bombay Lancers, and near two batteries of field artillery and two regiments of Bombay Native Infantry. The position occupied was on the side of a long valley extending from the town Citta Vecchia, the highest and most central part of the Island, and the head of the grand harbour. Like all parts of the island, it consisted of numerous small pieces of ground, each 50 to 60 yards square, surrounded by walls, and each enclosure having its own tank, a bag like excavation (dug out of the sandstone) lined with cement and containing rain or surface drainage water. Here the regiment was encamped in troops, as on the line of march, and the ordinary duties of camp-life were carried on, with riding school and rifle drills; but, with the exception of a few special occasions, there were no general parades, there being no ground for such purposes. The geology of the island may be briefly described thus: coral limestone at the top of the highest parts, next a layer of marl, under- neath this a thick layer of white and pale-yellow sandstone (the surface soil of San Antonia and of most parts of the Island), and beneath all semi-crystal limestone. The nature of the sur- face soil renders the general appearance of the island bare and barren, except in the season of crops. Of large shelter trees there are few, and in the complete absence of grassy vegetation, the white, dusty ground is particularly unpleasant to the eye-sight. The fig and lotus, and orange, and vine, however, flourish abundantly, as well as a large kind of prickly-pear, whose leaves afford food for cattle, and whose succulent fruit, in July and August, are a source of nourishment for the poorer classes. Of true alluvial soil there is next to none, yet with the abundant use of manure, and under the influence of heavy dews, the island is very prolific, yielding crops twice a year of cotton, wheat, barley, gram, clover, potatoes, melons, tomatoes and many other articles of diet. The climate is semi-tropical, mild in the winter months, when the thermometer ranges in the shade between 48° and 60°, and hot in summer, with the ther- mometer between 80° and 95°. The air is usually sub-charged with moisture, and at night dews are very heavy indeed. Plentiful rains are said to fall in winter; but during the summer months there are no rains, and this was the case in 1878, until September, when there was a heavy fall on two successive nights, previously to which, for a month or so, the usual north-west wind was frequently varied by a wind from the south-east called the sirrocco in consequence being attended by or giving rise to malaise, dyspepsia and bowel complaints.

Two latrines were constructed in rear of the lines, each consisting of a long trench some four feet deep, dug out of the sandstone, and enclosed with suitable board partitions to ensure privacy, Care was taken to cover over all excreta with crushed sandstone, and when the trench was three parts full, a new one was dug, and soon on a similar plan a small latrine was erected Tor the use of the hospital. The supply of drinking water was at first a little defective, and the men made use of that contained in the tank previously alluded to of which there were 18 in and near the lines. But in the course of a few days the use of this water was prohibited, and a plentiful supply was obtained from a closed aqueduct which was the means of conveying water from springs in a hill some five miles distant to Valetta. From this aqueduct it was brought close to the lines by means of iron pipes which led into covered cisterns for the use of the men and was thence issued by taps and into open troughs for the horses. This water was clear, wholesome, and apparently free from all impurities. Free rations were issued to all. At first flour, rice, dhal, ghee and spices, but on a representation that the dhal (urhur, toor) was a probable source of disease, vegetables were substituted for it, and meat also was served out as part of the ration. Fruits and vegetables were, however, cheap and plentiful, and were freely made use of, and liquor being readily procurable was partaken of by a great many; excess in its use was a rare occurrence. The regiment remained at Malta four months, and at the beginning of October, it again embarked on board two steamers, fitted up in and sent out from England, and reached Bombay in the third week of the month. As in its outward journey, it now proceeded to Meerut by trains, and went into its lines on the 1st November. The dieting of the troops somewhat differed from that of the trip to Malta, consisting of flour 1lb. 8 oz., dhal, potatoes, onions, 4 oz. alternately, fresh meat 4 oz. every other day, and all followers were considered non-cooking and bad dry food consisting of gram, dried rice, tamarind or raisins, ghee and sugar, &c.

On the 10th of July, a similar supply was received in two baskets packed in straw, the bottom of bottles upwards and exposed to view. On the morning of the 11th at 8 A.M., an inspection of the regiment was held at hospital, and some 90 men (of the 9th Bengal Cavalry and 10th Bengal Lancers) were picked out to receive lime-juice. To each man so selected about half an ounce was given, mixed with an equal quantity of water. The parade was dismissed, and the men went to their lines. In the course of about 20 minutes, two men were brought back to hospital foaming at the mouth, vomiting, and in great pain, and a report was made that all who had that day taken lime-juice were in a similar state. A reference to the bottles from which the lime-juice was said to have been given at once shewed that 2¼ bottles had been expended, of which the first from a previous stock contained lime-juice, a second from the new supply, similar in appearance in every respect and unlabelled, had contained Burnett's fluid, and a third from which ¼ had been used also contained poison, but was labelled. A subsequent examination of the baskets in which the supposed lime-juice had been received, proved that there were still 10 ordinary beer bottles filled with fluid which had the appearance of lime-juice, but which afterwards turned out to be poison, all unlabelled except one. In a very short space of time all the men who were suffering were brought to hospital, and with the assistance of other medical officers remedies were at once applied. The number poisoned was 48, viz ., 31 of' the 9th Bengal Cavalry and 17 belonging to the 10th Bengal Lancers. The symptoms varied in intensity in different individuals, but as a general rule, they were of much the same character in all, and commenced in about 20 minutes after the poison was taken. At first there was great burning and pain in the epigastrium, with vomiting, foaming at the mouth, and vertigo, succeeded by intense thirst, syncope, &c. The face became very pale, the eyes blood-shot, pupils contracted, pulse very small, and the heart's action feeble. The treatment at first consisted in encouraging sickness, chiefly by mustard and hot water, and as soon as this had been effected, raw eggs, magnesia, milk, soda- water and coffee were freely administered, and it is calculated that all had received remedies, on an average, within half an hour of being poisoned. Subsequently large quantities of milk and soda-water were obtained, and these were freely given to the unfortunate sufferers to relieve their intense thirst. At 10 A.M., or in about two hours after the poison had been taken, the most severe primary effects in many had subsided; but in some 8 or 10 cases the depressing effects of the poison were most marked, and it was feared that many of these would at once terminate fatally from collapse. In these cases the pulse was almost imperceptible and often intermittent, the pupils were contracted, the skin cold with clammy sweats, and there was partial insensibility. Mustard poultices and frictions were used, and brandy, chloric ether, ammonia and other stimulants were administered. Indeed, during the whole day, to these as well as to all others, stimulants were given in some form or other, and anodynes were also exhibited to relieve pain. Purging in five or six cases, with blood, was noticed between four and five hours after the poison was taken. At 2 P.M. there was a marked improvement in all those who, earlier in the day, were in a state of semi-collapse, and at 6 P.M. all were able to converse and answer questions freely. Many, however, were still very weak and vomiting continually, blood in five or six cases; others were still complaining of intense thirst and great burning pains in the esophagus and stomach. None, however, mentioned any pain in the mouth, nor was there in any case any indication of the mouth having been affected by the poison. In the evening morphia was subcutaneously injected over the epigastrium in 18 cases with marked beneficial effect both in allaying pain and in arresting vomiting. The treatment by palliatives and anodynes was continued during the next day. Many had recovered from the more urgent primary effects of the poison, but others were still very sick and were passing blood by the bowels; and some five or six cases were still very ill. On the 13th there was a marked improvement in the appearance of all, including the worst cases. The countenance, which before had exhibited an appearance of great pain and anxiety, was more natural, the skin was cool, the pulse less frequent, and the pupils acted freely. Many, however, were still suffering from purging and vomiting, and nearly all complained of burning pains behind the sternum and in the epigastrium. Very little medicine was used except anodynes, and no food was given except milk, soda-water and ice, until the evening, when several partook of a small quantity of sago. On the 14th, most of the sufferers were sitting up and cheerful, and were able to take small quantities of light diet of sago, arrowroot and soup. And between the 22nd and 26th, 17 were discharged who were able to eat their own food and who had apparently got over the effects of the poison. At the end of the month there were still 13 under treatment, and of these 5 were thin, weak and anæmic, and were unable to retain or digest anything but a very small amount of light farinaceous food, and they occasionally passed blood by the bowels. At the end of August, there were 5 cases still under treatment, and 2 of those which had previously been discharged were re-admitted in consequence of wasting, occasional sick- ness, pain in the epigastrium and inability to take proper food. At the end of September there were 4 cases of poisoning in hospital, and 4 re-admissions from the same cause. On the 3rd October, 1 man died from inanition. The regiment embarked for India on the 4th, and 2 cases of poisoning died during the voyage. They were mere skeletons. Very little food, of the small quantity retained, was either digested or absorbed, in consequence probably of extensive ulceration or destruction of mucous membrane, and indeed one of these was kept alive for three weeks solely by the use of injections into the bowel. In neither case could a post-mortem examination be made. Since the arrival of the regiment in India there has been no further mortality; and at the end of the year, of the 28 remaining cases, 15 were appa-

Such is a brief account of the sad catastrophe which befel the regiment during its residence at Malta. Before concluding, it may be well to observe that cinchona alkaloid has been extensively used in cases of periodical fever, and with almost, if not quite, as much success as quinine. In cases in which it has failed, quinine has failed likewise. Often, however, where both of these have been given in the usual way without benefit, hypodermic injection of quinine has effected a cure, and no bad result has ever followed, chiefly, it would appear, from taking two precautions, viz ., first, to use a very neutral solution of quinine, dissolved with tartaric acid; secondly, to allow none of the injected fluid to remain in one spot, but gently and carefully to rub it well into the interstices of the areolar tissue.

This, as far as it goes, would lead to the conclusion that the "jorab" is a very admirable protection against feet blistering, and it is what the men themselves most approve of, and in war time, it may be worth while to supply two pairs to each soldier at the public expense.

A small supply of rum for the use of the weakly only was here procured. Warm clothing, consisting of one jersey, two pairs of warm socks (both English), and a native blanket of very inferior texture, were sup- plied. The water-proof sheets and mittens for each man and the 15 per cent. of poshteens for sentries, were not available although clearly directed to be furnished (vide Military Department No. 789K, dated 9th November 1878). The want of them caused much misery, and when the mettle of the men were overtaxed by deficient clothing, especially when on night guard, and deficient and unsuitable food, less than half rations, and excessive work too. Nearly all our deaths arose from pneumonia in spring. One cannot but remark on the policy which led to the serving out of two pairs of socks, while a pair of boots or shoes was denied, although the men were prepared to pay any money for them; many of the boots were already worn out, and ere the Bolan was passed, a very large number from being compelled to walk on their stocking soles arrived at Quetta bootless and bare-footed. Blucher used to maintain that food and leather were the real elements of military success. The water in the Bolan was however good, the men had better food, and there was no night marching; so the sick list soon began to drop and the flagged and jaded to pick up. Every care was taken of the men and follow- ers, and no matter at what hour they arrived, herbage was cut for bedding and the tent sealed from the keen winds by earth trenches and "pies." This was a tedious duty, but in association with the dietetic care of the sick, bore its own reward, for in the sequel it will be noted that by a rigorous pursuit of this plan, the regiment consisting of 1,381 (of whom 618 were combatants) reached the year's end without the loss of a single life in any grade; and I may add, en parenthese, without the loss of a sepoy until the 14th day of February 1879, when the first man perished from asthenic pneumonia induced by excessive cold, insufficient food and unsuitable clothing.

The camels of the convoy alone, exclusive of those of the wing and those carrying a month's provisions, were 520 in number. To load these camels in the morning with the ammunition boxes was 2½ hours' hard work for the sipahis, the wing being 240 strong. The camp and baggage had then to be laden. The camels marched very slowly and were constantly falling down, and loads had to be changed. The work on the march was very severe, and then on arrival at camp there was two hours' hard work to be done100 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL, STATION PERIOD. Strength.

The severe duties of the large convoy especially, told on the right-half battalion, it, with an average strength of 234.06, losing 7 men (died) on the march to Quetta; whilst head-quarters on the same march, with an average strength of 358.69, not losing a single man. The brackish water affected almost every one without exception very disagreeably; when not causing severe illness, it gave rise to looseness of the bowels, with very severe griping pains. The prevalence of certain disorders changed very regularly with the vary- ing conditions under which the regiment was placed; the prevalent disease being invariably such as was to be expected. Thus at Mooltan, in October and early part of November, men were in thin tents on a hot plain, subjected to great heat in the day, with comparatively chilly nights; and, as might be expected, malarial affections predominated enormously, the total treated for them being 146; while only 11 were treated for bowel complaints. In the next month, when the day temperature was still high and nights cold, we have still numerous malarial affections, total treated 109; but in this month we have a second factor, bad water, and we find total treated for bowel complaints, 61. In the third mouth, when the temperature fell, we find a remarkable change in malarial affections, total treated now being reduced to 25. But in the early part of the month the water was still very bad, until the regiment entered the Bolan Pass. Hence we had bowel complaints 47 total treated, nearly all being admissions in the early part of the mouth. The records of the right-half battalion show equally clearly, the connection in disease between cause and effect, and how regularly certain diseases will result from certain conditions.

In the latter half of December, When exposed to the bitter cold and hard frost in the Bolan Pass, and at Quetta, many- men contracted pneumonia. They had not the constitution to withstand the disease, and several- men succumbed to it. One-fourth of the whole regiment (129 men). were left at the base hospital at Quetta as unfit to proceed to the front, and most of their diseases were induced by insufficient and unwholesome food, insufficient clothing and bad drinking water. At the com- mencement of this year, some striking instances of the ultimate effect of bad and insufficient food occurred at Khelati-i-Ghilzi. Several men complained of swollen feet. I suspected at first that it might have been caused by wearing the putties too tightly, or by exposure to cold; but there were no marks of pressure on the legs. The feet were equally swollen, and there was no burning pain as though they had been touched up by the frost. The disease was simple SIRHIND DIVISION. 103 XVI.

The accommodation for the sick was not sufficient to admit all the cases into hospital. It became the practice to call the disease remittent fever at Cyprus in the returns submitted, but I could not and cannot subscribe to the doctrine of the summer fever at Cyprus being a remittent fever, and differ from the high opinion of Dr. Sullivan in considering it an intermittent fever purely. It May be a curious coincidence of ardent or heat fever and malaria, for after the fever had lost its continuous character, and when the strength of' the disease was broken, an intermit- tent type was assumed. This was observed in many of the cases at sea where they had begun at Cyprus as a fever constantly or without any remission or intermission and ended as agues with shivering and periodical returns. It was not uncommon to get relapses of the complaint, and this continued till some few days after the arrival of the regiment at Cawnpore on the 20th September. There was great prostration with the fever, severe headache, and much bilious vomiting. The majority of the cases were slight and of three or four days' duration, but several were very severe, and many very persistent, leaving the men very anæmic and broken in health, which a change to India alone cured. There were no deaths from the fever; the vomiting was the most distressing symptom present, and was checked most by effervescing draughts and stimulants; quinine and cinchona febrifuge could only be given when the force of the fever had abated. Stimulating diaphoreties were freely used for the first few days. The following is a table of the Cyprus fever in the 31st Puniab Native Infantry:106 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL, from there marched to Kohat, arriving on the 22nd of October; again marching on the 2nd of November arrived at Thull on the 20th of that month; crossed the frontier into the Koorum valley on the 21st with the field force, and was on service in the Koorum and Harriah valleys to the 31st of December.

During the halt of the regiment at Rajanpore, great efforts were made to remedy the unsatisfactory sanitary condition of the camp, but this was rendered difficult by there being only one mehter allowed for each troop.

Cultivation was rare, and even where it existed there were often no habi- tations, the ground being cultivated by wandering tribes, who only remain in the neighbourhood of their crops during the rainy season. A few cows were occasionally seen grazing, but animal life was scarce. Even vultures and birds and beasts of prey seemed to shun these desert regions, for the dead. bodies of camels left by corps that had preceded us remained for days untouched. It was at first intended that the regiment should halt one day at Dera Bughti and one at Lehri, but at the former place orders were left not to halt till arrival at Mittri; here a halt of one day was made, and was much needed and gladly welcomed by everyone. The regiment reached Dadur on December 19th and halted there till the 26th, when it marched through the Bolan Pass, reaching Sir-i-ab on December 31st. This part of the march was very trying from being an ascent a great part of the way over gravel and stones. Water, it is true, with the exception of at Dasht-be-doulat, was good and more plentiful than in the early part of the march, but in some places no supplies of any kind were procurable, and even forage and food for camels had to be carried with us. The climate became much colder as we ascended, and at Dasht-be-doulat we were -glad to pitch the camp under the shelter of some hills to protect us from the cold cutting wind. On the long marches the baggage and followers did not come in till late at night, when the sick suffered greatly from want of food, which there was no time to cook, and at Dasht-be-doulat their poultices could not be changed for want of water to prepare them with. Some of the encamping grounds were in the stony beds of rivers, where the ground was very rough and uncomfortable for the men to lie on. XIV.

Second, the flatness of the general surface and the,absence of all natural lines of drainage prevent the surface water, after a heavy fall of rain or an inundation from the Chenab, from running off.

Special observations and remarks. 142 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL, Subsequently, however, it being found that the men were in the habit of selling a portion of their flour ration, this was reduced to three-quarters of a seer. The quantity of the other constituents of the ration was left unchanged. Some goor was also carried by the Commis- sariat, but as it did not form part of the rations issued, it may be left out of consideration. Throughout this campaign the sensitiveness of the sepoy to cold has often been the subject of remark, and in the search for the reason of this I had considered amongst other things his diet, comparing it with that of the European soldier whom cold has affected much less. The following may be taken as a fairly accurate statement of the amount of albuminates, fats and carbo-hydrates in the sepoy's present ration:143 PESHAWAR DISTRICT. the same dietetic value, we cannot say that the sepoy is not placed at a disadvantage by his, exclusively vegetable diet. My own impression is that he would be more robust and better able to resist cold if a small allowance of meat were substituted for a part of his large allow- ance of flour.- It is an error to say that Hindus will not eat meat of any kind; they will all, if allowed to kill it themselves, eat the flesh of sheep and goats. (An officer Who was with the 2nd Goorkhas at Malta tells me that he frequently saw his men buying Meat at butchers' stalls.) And here, too, the few sheep and goats that have fallen as spoil to the men, have been eaten by them with great satisfaction. Clothing. X.

About the sixth day, when the signs of irritant fever subside and are replaced by those of general depression, and there is abundant secretion of mucus, I have stopped the aconite and given the ammonia mixture. The results of this treatment have been very encouraging; not only has the mortality been much less, but the duration of individual cases much shorter. Instead of as formerly dragging out a long convalescence of several weeks, they are sometimes fit to return to duty in a fortnight. It must, however, be added, that the present cases of pneumonia are of a less serious type than the earlier ones, usually two, only one lung is now attacked; still after making a deduction on account of the foregoing, I am convinced that by giving aconite at the be- ginning in small often-repeated doses, both the fatality and the duration of pneumonia may be material1y lessened.

On the 27th November the regiment reached Koorum Fort, and at daybreak on the 28th marched for the Peiwar Kotul, about 18 miles distant, and found the Afghan army posted on its crest. In the reconnoisance which followed, the regiment lost one sepoy wounded. At daybreak on the 2nd December, after marching throughout the whole of the previous night over very difficult ground, the regiment gallantly led the attack on, and captured the Afghan position on the Spingawai Kotul. Two sepoys were killed and 18 wounded on this day. Subsequently the regiment marched to Ali Kheyl in the Hariah valley, and formed part of the force that reconnoitered to the foot of the Shuturgurdan Pass, 11,500 feet above the sea. On the 12th December, General Roberts led a small part of his force, among them the 5th Goorkhas, back to Koorum by an unfrequented route on the south-west Of the Hariah valley, and which passing through difficult and mountainous country led into the Koorum valley on its extreme west. It was while passing through the Mungear defile leading into this valley that the regiment was attacked on the 13th December by the Munguls, a marauding tribe living in the neighbouring hills, and three sepoys killed, and one officer and 11 sepoys wounded. Captain Powell, who was the officer wounded, and one sepoy subsequently died of their wounds. On the 19th December the regiment returned to Koorum Fort, and active opera- tions ceased. From the date the regiment left Thull till its return to Koorum on 19th De- cember, a period of 27 days, 5 men were killed in action, and 1 officer and 30 men wounded out of 30 wounded 8 were so slightly injured as not to require treatment in hospital.

Its accession was sudden. The regiment reached Thull on 23rd October with 9 cases of fever in hospital; on the 31st there were 50 cases.

There were also 7 men who died out of hospital, and from the following causes, viz.: PUNJAB FRONTIER FORCE. 157 keep up with the regiment; the men were consequently Without great-coats or bedding for three nights, and without food for the last clay also. The nights were very cold and windy, and I have no doubt that the seeds of many a fatal illness were there sown. On the 24th the regiment marched to Lundi.Khana, 11 miles distant,158 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL, in hospital, experiencing attacks of fever day after day until they were reduced to an extremely anæmic and debilitated condition, in which state they readily succumbed to the first attack of any serious disease. The fever (endemic) began to decline about the beginning of October, but its effects were apparent in the men's health for a long time afterwards. a During the time the regiment was at Jumrood, the men suffered much from dysentery, no less than 88 admissions for this disease having taken place in a strength of 362 in about six weeks. I am ignorant as to What may have caused the prevalence of the disorder. Food supplies were very good, vegetables procurable, and the camp was kept in a fairly sanitary condition; possibly it May have been due to the drinking-water, which was very muddy, but in other respects seemed to be as wholesome as water generally is in India. I append an analysis of a specimen of this water, which was made by the Chemical Examiner at Lahore. On the arrival of the regiment at Dakka, the men began to suffer greatly from inflammatory affections of the lungs, in the Shape of pneumonia, pleurisy or bronchitis; frequently from a compound of all these. The first case was admitted on the 26th November, and between that date and the 31st Decem- ber no less than 70 admissions from these diseases took place in a strength of 478 men. The disorder doubtless originated in the exposure undergone on the march (as stated at paragraph 13) from Jumrood, and was further aggravated by the unsanitary state of the Dakka Fort, and by the arduous duty, especially at night. I have reason to think that it extended also by infection, as several cases occurred among men who were in hospital for diseases of a totally different nature, such as colic, dysentery, congestion of spleen, &amp;c.; not only this, but several healthy men who were attending on pneumonia patients were seized by the same disease, as also were two hospital assistants who slept in the tent in which the worst pneumonia cases were being treated.

In many cases the patients, although they affirmed that they had been in good health a few hours previously, already had the appearance of men smitten by a fatal disease; their faces wore an anxious look, and they seemed to have lost the power of self-control, tossing their limbs about, and talking in an excited, half-rational manner. In some cases there was active de- lirium, in others unconsciousness more or less complete, and in som.e violent convulsions. The pulse was invariably very quick, 140 or thereabouts, generally weak and compressible; the respiration was much accelerated, about 40 or 50; and the breath often had a peculiar cadaveric odour at an early period of the disease. The temperature seldom rose above 103°. The tongue was generally dry and brown, sometimes almost black, and the teeth covered with sordes at the time of admission. The chief symptoms complained of were pain in some portion of the chest, with difficulty of breathing. The character of the expectorated matter varied; in some of the worse cases there was none at all, in others it was thin and frothy, but in a considerable num- ber it was viscid and tinged with blood or rust-coloured; these cases usually did well. With regard to treatment, nearly every reputed remedy, short of venisection (which did not appear suitable to any of the cases) and aconite (which was not procurable), was tried. The internal medicines included stimulants in moderate and few quantities; calomel, tartar emetic, in a few cases ipecacuanha, carbonate of ammonia, quinine, inhalations of steam and of steam impregnated with carbolic acid. The external remedies were:160 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL, CASTE. Strength on 1st December 1878. Admissions. Admissions per cent. of strength. Deaths.

The bank is Within about 100 yards from the lines occupied by the 3rd Punjab Infantry, and a little lower down within 10 yards of the Commissioner's house; but the energetic steps taken diverted the current till the floods began to subside. I was only able to visit one outpost, Drabund, about 45 miles due west and situated beneath the Tukht-i Suleiman (about 12,000 feet high). The fort, as it is called, is merely a square enclosure, with a Watch-house, and is garrisoned by 25 sowars and 50 bayonets. The road is over barren plains to within 5 miles of the village of Drabund, where there is dense cultivation at that time (April) of wheat. There is a perennial stream from the hills, and the whole country round is irrigated by it. There are no wells, not even in the fort, and the men complain of the hill-water, though it seemed and tasted good. Close to the village is an old Sikh fort in ruins, which would hold 2,000 or 3,000 men, built by the Sikhs to command the pass. Supplies are plentiful and cheap. The men say it is very cold in winter and hot in summer; it is not a favourite outpost with them. The hospital-assistant at Manjhi outpost visits Drabund weekly or oftener if required; but there is very little sickness. Near the village are large encampments of puvindahs, who yearly come down to trade; they leave their families here, and go on with their camels and goods. The country near is much cut up with ravines and old beds of nullahs. The road crosses the Luni nullah, 16 miles from Dera Ismail Khan, which empties itself into the Indus below the station, and when in flood its water is used for irrigation purposes. The other outposts are Zam and Girni; another hospital- assistant has charge of both. There is little sickness at any of the outposts, but the duties are heavy, and now the work is monotonous, there having been no raids for a long time. Meteorology. IV. Meteorology.

On the march of a convoy to Kandahar, some thieves attacked a straggling party and left a syce for dead, but he managed to crawl into camp. On the return of the division some weeks after, just as we were entering camp, a man who was working in the fields turned round to see the tumasha and was instantly recognised by the syce, who was then on a camel, as the man who had attacked him. He was taken into camp and searched; articles of the syce's property were found on him and in his house. A commis- sion was ordered to assemble, and sentence of death was passed on him.
