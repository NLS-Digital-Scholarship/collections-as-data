D. No. 836. OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH . MADRAS, 15th August 1922. From MAJOR A. J. H. RUSSELL, M.A., M.D., D.P.H., I.M.S., Director of Public Health, Madras. To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT (PUBLIC HEALTH) DEPARTMENT, MADRAS. SIR, I have the honour to forward the Report on Vaccination in the Madras Presidency for the year 1921-22. The report being intertriennial, it is necessarily a brief one. The old designation of &quot; Deputy Sanitary Commissioner and Inspector of Vaccination&quot; was changed into &quot;Assistant Director of Public Health &quot; in G.O. No. 367-P.H., dated 8th March 1922. 2. Dr. Jesudoss was Assistant Director of Public Health in charge of the Central range, and Captain Ubhaya of the Southern range throughout the year. Dr. Adisesha Ayyar was in charge of the Northern range till the end of November 1921, and on his appointment as Assistant Director of Public Health (Vital Statistics), Captain Subrahmanyam took charge of the Northern range. 3. The following statement shows the inspection work of Assistant Directors of Public Health:2 Range. Name. Date. Places inspected. Purpose. Central range ...

The following table exhibits the total vaccination work performed by all agencies in the Presidency :5 An improvement of 17.1 per cent in the total success rate under primary vaccination is a satisfactory feature. The improvement is almost the same in all three ranges, the rates being about 19 per cent in the Southern range, about 18 per cent in the Central range and 14 per cent in the Northern range. The cessation of vaccination during the hot weather months and improved quality of the vaccine lymph supplied by the King Institute, Guindy, probably both combined to make the improvement possible. Now that the downward curve of the past few years has been reversed it is hoped that the increased percentage in success rate will be progressively higher. 8. Compared with the previous year there was an increase of 62,985 in the number of children under one year of age successfully vaccinated. This is more or less satisfactory especially when one remembers that routine vaccination was entirely stopped for nearly four months in the year, but inspections of the child population in the Presidency make it evident that a very large proportion is still entirely unprotected by vaccination. The districts which attained the largest percentage of increase were the Nilgiris (+ 24.2), R6 11. The percentage of success obtained by the use of different kinds of lymph in local fund and municipal areas is compared in the following table:VACCINATION STATEMENTS.

No. 1496-P.H, 31st October 1922 Vaccination Report Recording the 2 No. 1496-P.H., 31ST OCTOBER 1922 the population is ripe for another epidemic. The vicious circle will continue unless and until the necessity for protection is realized by local bodies and the public. 5. Responsibility for ensuring protection rests with municipal councils and local boards. A fair index of their conscience is the number of successful operations performed annually per thousand of the population. The figures are tabulated in Annexure A to this order, together with the number per mille &quot; protected.&quot; This &quot; protection rate &quot; is calculated on the total number success- fully vaccinated or revaccinated during the preceding seven years, seven years being the period at which vaccination normally requires to be reinforced by re-vaccination. 6. In the districts the &quot; protection rate &quot; in the year under report ranges from 297 per mille in the Nilgiris to 135 per mille in Salem, the mean being 179 per mille. In municipalities the variations are much more startling. The mean is 312 per mille. Madura stands easily first, with 764 per mille. Calicut stands second (586 per mille), Vizianagram third (519 per mille). The last ten munici- palities on the list have been rather recently constituted, and it is hardly fair to reckon against them the bad old record of their pre-municipal days. But older municipalities such as Nellore (185 per mille). Tirupati (169), TiruvNo. 1496-P.H., 31ST OCTOBER 1922 3 10. In one respect vaccination work in rural areas contrasts very favourably with that done in municipalities, viz., in the number of operations performed by the vaccinators. The facts given in column 8 of statement I on pages 84 No. 1496-P.H., 31ST OCTOBER 1922 figures would be far worse if the true number of births were known.

D. No. 202-P.H. OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH, MADRAS, 15th August 1923. From MAJOR A. J. H. RUSSELL, M.A., M.D., D.P.H., I.M.S., Director of Public Health, Madras, TO THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT (PUBLIC HEALTH) DEPARTMENT, MADRAS, SIR, I have the honour to forward the Report on Vaccination in the Madras Presidency for the triennium ending 1922-23. 2. Consequent on the introduction of the complete District Health Scheme, the Vaccination Department as such has been merged into the wider Public Health Department. The Deputy Inspectors of Vaccination who previously supervised only vaccination work in their ranges are now, under the District Health Scheme, responsible for all branches of Public Health Administration. As a consequence, their designation has been altered to that of Health Inspectors2 Educational Department and the Military Department have all agreed to postpone vaccination amongst their employees during the summer months. Instructions have been issued to all Vaccinators and Health Inspectors that during the off- season the unprotected registers should be brought up to date by house-to-house inquiry, if necessary, so that when the vaccination season recommences no delay need be experienced. 7. The publication of the revised Vaccination Code, or more properly the Vaccination Section of the Public Health Code, was delayed pending the issue of the rules for vaccination in non-municipal areas. These have now been approved by Government in G.O. No. 832-P.H., dated 23rd May 1923, and the Code is in the Press. 8. Captain N. R. Ubhaya was the Assistant Director of Public Health in charge of the Southern range and Captain R. B. Subrahmanyam of the Northern range throughout the year. The late Dr. S. Jesudoss held charge of the Central range till 13th August 1922 when he proceeded on leave handing over charge to Dr. R. Adisesha Ayyar who continued to be in charge till 5th September 1922. Dr. Adisesha Ayyar was relieved by Dr. K. T. Matthew who was in charge of the range till 5th December 1922, when Dr. Ethirajulu Nayudu took charge. 9. The following statement shows the inspection work of Assistant Directors of Public Health:3 Range. Name. Date. Places inspected. Purpose. Central Range 4 Range. Name. Date. Places inspected.

The increase in the number of Health Inspectors and Vaccinators as com- pared with the previous years was due to the introduction of the District Health Scheme in 5 districts, viz., Tanjore, Trichinopoly, Vizagapatam, Kistna and Kurnool. 11.

In the Northern Range, the municipalities showed an improvement chiefly- due to the failure of the non-co-operation movement. There was a fall in the local fund areas due to (1) employment of inefficient and unqualified vaccinators and paucity of first-class vaccinators, (2) failure to verify all cases vaccinated, (3) failure to raise the minimum of vaccinators in order to make up for non-vaccination during the off-season and (4) non-employment of additional vaccinators. In the Central Range, when compared with the two previous years all the districts except Kurnool showed an increased rate. The lowest figures are those of Salem district (19.4) and South Arcot district (19.9). For the Presidency the percentage of success under primary vaccinations has progressively increased during the past two years, the actual figures for 1920-21, 1921-22 and 1922-23 being 61.5 per cent, 78.6 per cent and 87.6 per cent, respectively. These large increases are very gratifying and the figure for 1922-23 is one which American authorities consider to be very satisfactory. It is hoped that by (1) the cessation of vaccination during hot weather months, (2) the supply of improved quality of vaccine lymph by the King Institute of Preventive Medicine and (3) the recent introduction of District Health Scheme throughout the Presidency, there will be a still further increase in the percentage of success in future years, when it will be possible to explain more satisfactorily the variations in success rates as required in G.O. Mis. No. 1672-P.H., dated 2nd December 1922. 18. Infantile vaccination.8 Districts which showed a decrease of over 10 per cent in this respect were Nellore (9 and municipalities during the year is shown in the annexed diagrams. The year under report recorded the highest number of deaths in the Northern Range, the majority of which occurred in the local fund areas. The largest number of deaths was recorded in South Arcot (1,754) and the lowest in Kurnool (244). Though vaccination was compulsory in the South Arcot district, the recorded birth rate is the lowest in the Central Range, viz., 24.5. Imperfect registration is evidently the root cause of the high prevalence of this disease in this district. In the Southern Range, the mortality from smallpox was 10,512 during 1922 against 2,846 in 1921, an enormous increase. The eastern districts were very badly affected. Amongst municipalities, Madura, Cochin, Palghat and Coimbatore suffered badly and in the latter two towns vaccination and re-vaccination were carried out in a most unsatisfactory fashion. In the Agency, 6 ranges out of 9 were free from smallpox. In the other 3 ranges the total number of attacks were 250 and deaths 32. 22. The conduct and work of the Health Inspectors has been generally satisfactory during the year under report. Inspection of vaccinated cases by Health Inspectors was on the whole fair, 99 Health Inspectors having verified over 75 per cent and 53 below 75 per cent. Suitable notice has been taken of those Health Inspectors who failed to reach the minimum percentage of verifi- cations. 23. During the year under report 5 Health Inspectors were punished with fine, two with suspension and one with stoppage of increment. 24. The Service Registers of all Health Inspectors are verified in this office. 25. With reference to Government Memorandum No. 5265-1 P.H., dated 25th May 1922, I append herewith a consolidated statement showing the quantity of lymph supplied to municipalities during 1922. There was a general increase in the demand for vaccine lymph in the following municipalities over that of 1921 :10 local knowledge they think that the percentage falls short of the Presidency average of 1919-20. Registration of vital statistics must be made compulsory and, if local boards are to be responsible for the public health of the area under their control, should be in close touch with the registered figures. With the recent increase of pay to village headmen who have hitherto been considered as honorary revenue officials in the villages, it should be possible to legislate on more rigid lines and fix a definite responsibility on them in this respect and subject to legal penalty. At present neither the local boards on whom the responsibility for public health administration rests nor the superior members of the Public Health Department have any sort of control over these village headmen who are also the registrars of vital statistics. The superior District officers of the Revenue Department under whose control village headmen are placed are unable to devote any appreciable time in checking the accuracy of registration in villages. Under the rules in force local bodies are not furnished with statements of vital statistics registered in their areas and until such facilities are afforded local boards will be unable to discharge their duties in a fitting manner with regard to the public health of the areas entrusted to their care. Village officers can only have one controlling head, namely, the Collector. But as the Collector or his Deputies have no time to control their village officials neglect of vital statistics must involve statutory and legal punishment. Failing this, Government must make up their mind that any statistics are inaccurate and will continue to be inaccurate.

D. No. 245-P.H. OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH, MADRAS, 28th June 1924. From DR. K. T. MATTHEW, D.Hy. (Durham), D.P.H. (Cantab), Officiating Director of Public Health, Madras. To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT (PUBLIC HEALTH) DEPARTMENT, MADRAS. SIR, I have the honour to submit the Report on Vaccination in the Madras Presidency for the year 1923-24. 1. The District Health Scheme, which had been in force in the districts of Kistna, Kurnool, Tanjore, Trichinopoly and Vizagapatam, was on 1st April 1923 extended to the remaining districts of the Presidency with the exception of the Nilgiris and the Agency portions of Ganj2 6. Captain N. R. Ubhaya was Assistant Director of Public Health in charge of Southern Range and Dr. B. Ethirajulu Nayudu of Central Range, till 1st October 1923, when their duties were re-allocated on a functional basis. Under this arrangement, Captain Ubhaya was in charge of vaccination throughout the Presidency for the remaining period. Captain R. B. Subrahmanyam was in charge of Northern Range till 16th August 1923, when he was reverted to his permanent appointment as Health Officer, Ootacamund Municipality, owing to reduction in the number of Assistant Directors of Public Health. 7. The subjoined statement shows the inspection work of the Assistant Directors of Public Health:3 Range. Name. Date. Places inspected. Purpose. Capt. N. R. Ubhaya 4 districts, because attempts to secure properly qualified men were not made by the Taluk Boards. Special stress was laid on the subject by this department in previous vaccination reports but with no tangible result. Presidents of local boards should be required to appoint the full number with the least possible delay. There is no dearth of qualified hands now, and if only the local boards would offer adequate pay and allowances, any number of qualified men will be readily forthcoming. The district of North Arcot gives a more adequate pay to its vaccinators and it would be well for the other districts to follow its example. Here it may be mentioned that only in a few districts in the Presidency the posts of vaccinators are pensionable. As an important step towards improving the efficiency of this branch of administration, the other District Boards would be well advised to make the posts of vaccinators pensionable at as early a date as possible. 11. The new scheme of vaccination was in force during the year throughout the Presidency and the rules for working the scheme were revised and re-issued in G.O. No. 832-P.H., dated 23rd May 1923. The quality of vaccination in general showed a distinct improvement over the results recorded last year. The obstacles to the progress of vaccination alluded to in paragraph 13 of the last year's report remain much the same as before and any attempt at improvement is not possible until the revenue authorities and magistracy evince a more genuine interest in the progress of vaccination. The District Health Officer, Ganj5 15. The indifference of the village officers in the proper maintenance of the village vaccination registers is another great obstacle to the progress of vaccination. The record of work done by the District Health staff in this direction during the last vaccination off-season shows how numerous are the omissions of unprotected cases in the registers. Complaints preferred by the Health staff on this account are often taken no notice of. The instructions laid down in regard to the maintenance of these registers by Presidents of Union Boards in union areas, are in some instances not given effect to. The District Health Officer, Trichinopoly, reports that the Lalgudi Union Board has refused to undertake this duty and has formally passed a resolution to that effect. 16. The kits of vaccinators in certain districts were either not promptly supplied or were very unsatisfactory. A circular detailing the list of articles to be supplied to vaccinators was issued to all local bodies during the year and they were requested to see that the supply was made promptly. It has been suggested that it would conduce to greater efficiency if the supplies and renewals of equipments are undertaken by the District Boards themselves, recovering the cost thereof from the Taluk Boards in due course. This is worth consideration. 17. In regard to the enforcement of the compulsory provisions of vaccination there seems to be wide variations between one district and another. The great majority of the Taluk Boards show disinclination to sanction prosecutions. This hampered the work of vaccination a good deal and afforded every convenience to the villagers to slight the rules and render the compulsory system practically a misnomer. Until more of the Taluk Boards realize the necessity for enforcing the compulsory rules, not much benefit will result from &quot; Compulsory Vaccination.&quot; In one district6 Compared with the previous year, the total number of operations during the year under review shows a satisfactory increase. The increase noticed may be attributed to the following causes:7 Districts. No. Particulars of vaccination. No. District Health Scheme, 1921-22. Partial introduc- tion of District Health Scheme, 1922-23. Full District Health Scheme, 1923-24. Increase over 1921-22. Increase over 1922-23. Kurnool 8 The percentage of success under primary vaccination and re-vaccination showed an increase during the year under report. Compared with the previous year, the increase under primary vaccination amounts to 10.8 per cent and under re-vaccination 3.0 per cent. The supply of glycerine lymph, the suspension of routine vaccination work during the hot-weather months and the better interest taken by the vaccinating staff as a result of the introduction of the District Health Scheme, all combined, brought about this increase. 25. Persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population varied from 20.7 in Salem district to 52.0 in the Nilgiris district. The most prominent feature during the year under report is the steady and distinct increase over last year in the ratio per cent of successful cases in all the districts in the Presidency. The largest increases were noticed in the districts of Gunt9 Vizianagram (10 infantile mortality, secondary vaccinations and out-births. None of these calcula- tions however hold good for a municipality where vaccination has been systemati- cally neglected for years. In such cases the fixing of an arbitrary minimum as proposed by Government till the arrears are worked up is the only right course. 30. The percentage of success obtained by the use of the different kinds of lymph in primary vaccination (including secondary) in Local Fund and Municipal areas is compared in the sub-joined statement:11 disposed to think that an extension of the scheme to areas where it is not applicable at present, and the appointment of Health Officers in at least all the larger munici- palities in the Presidency would enable still further progress being made in this direction. It should be noted that vaccination is particularly backward in the Agency tracts where owing to unhealthy conditions and difficulty of communica- tion, supervision over vaccinators' work is at a very low level. 36. For the preparation of this report, the consolidated annual returns of vaccination received from the several districts were found incorrect and I had therefore to call for the individual returns of Health Inspectors. The checking of these returns and the compilation of the figures for the Presidency took time. Besides, the returns from the District Medical Officer, Ganj12 VACCINATION A.13 STATEMENTS. DEPARTMENT.

The formula proposed by the Director of Public Health for fixing the minimum outturn of vaccination in municipalities is commended to Chairmen of Municipal Councils for adoption. The Government trust that all Municipal Councils will realize the importance of employing trained Health Officers to guard public health. By taking advantage of the scheme of provincialization of munici- pal health officers, the cost incurred by the Councils will be very little when compared with the manifold advantages which they will derive from the services of trained health officers.

REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1924-25 MADRAS PRINTED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT, GOVERNMENT PRESS 1925
ANNUAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1924-25. 1. Except in the Nilgiris, where the District Board exercises control, the administration of vaccination in rural areas continues to be vested in Taluk Boards. District Health Officers are unanimously of opinion that, in the interests of efficiency and discipline, this branch of Public Health administration should be transferred to the District Boards. This subject has been before Government for a considerable time and it is hoped that favourable orders will be issued at an early date. 2. Glycerinated lymph was used throughout the Presidency during the year under report. Revised instructions in its use were embodied in G.O. No. 1125- P.H., dated 6th August 1924, which was issued to all officers of the department for guidance. 3. An important innovation during the year was the substitution of the old scarifying lancets by rotary lancets. Although these are comparatively expen- sive, both as regards their initial cost and their maintenance, the higher percentage of success obtained and the greater uniformity in the results justify the increased expenditure. 4. During the 32 I.3 the additional Health Inspectors asked for were not sanctioned by Government, and this increased the difficulties. In G.O. Mis. No. 1170-P.H., dated 9th.June 1925, the proposal to create additional vaccination ranges in the Agency Tracts has been deferred until 1926-27. It is hoped that the Government in the budget for 1926-27 will make provision not only for the increased staff of Health Inspectors in the Agency, but also for all the twenty-eight additional men already asked for. 7. In spite of the criticisms made in these annual vaccination reports, many Local Boards and Municipalities either fail to maintain the full complement of vaccinators, or employ men who do not possess the qualifications prescribed in G.O. No. 963 L., dated 4th July 1917, as modified in G.O. No. 1167, L. and M., dated 4th April 1925. With few exceptions these unqualified men are incompe- tent, and are a serious handicap to the administration. A large number have not even an elementary knowledge of antisepsis, far less of the technique of vaccina- tion. Their retention is to be entirely deprecated, especially as at the present time the Public Health Department has to counteract the insidious propaganda of the anti-vaccinationist, who is always prepared to publish exaggerated reports of any untoward incidents. Immediate steps should therefore be taken to replace all unqualified men with qualified vaccinators. The continued employment of a large number of unqualified vaccinators, although men with qualifications are available, is mainly due to the reluctance of local bodies to offer adequate scales of pay. In G.O. No. 354-P.H., dated 1st March 1923, the Government expressed the opinion that a uniform scale of pay for vaccinators employed by local boards and Municipalities was neither necessary nor desirable, and they left the discretion of determining the scale of pay to the Local Bodies themselves. This has unfortunately led to a considerable degree of inconsistency. The pay offered by a number of local bodies is so small that it is impossible to expect any qualified vaccinator to accept the appointment. Unless a minimum scale of salary sufficiently high to attract qualified men is fixed by the Government, and local bodies are given the option of giving higher scales suitable to local exigencies, the improvement in the staff, which is so desirable, will be a matter of extreme difficulty. Proposals are being submitted separately to Government regarding the revision of the scales prescribed in G.O. No. 963 L., dated 4th July 1917. 8. The compartmental system of control of vaccination was in operation throughout the Presidency, excepting G4 vaccinator is interfered with in his work, he cannot expect any assistance from the Local Board. Instances have occurred where equipment has been damaged, and the vaccinator himself has been assaulted ; whilst in one extreme case in Bellary district there was even an attempt at murder by an enraged parent. In view of these facts, it is very desirable that vaccination should be declared compulsory throughout the whole Presidency. Every District Health Officer, in whose district non-compulsory areas exist, has urged that the change is essential. In several districts, e.g., North Arcot, Tanjore, Madras and Trichinopoly, vaccination is already compulsory, and there is no reason why it should be otherwise in other parts of the Presidency. (b) Declaration of compulsory vaccination is, however, not a sufficient remedy unless the law is enforced. Wholesale prosecution of defaulters is admittedly unwise ; but cognizance of breach of the law is occasionally essential, if the law is to be obeyed. It is therefore to be regretted that Presidents of Local Boards and Chairmen of Municipal Councils, in whom the powers of prosecution are vested, are generally unwilling to exercise them. For instance, the President of a Taluk Board in Tanjore district refused to sanction prosecution even in a single case, although a large number of defaulters was reported to him ; while it also appears that he attempted, happily without success, to induce the other Presidents to follow his example. Unless local bodies realize that no law is self- enforcing, and that a few selected prosecutions are necessary, the declaration of compulsory vaccination will be of little avail. (i) Another regrettable feature is the attempt of some union boards to disown the statutory obligations imposed on them under the Local Boards Act and the rules framed thereunder. In other cases these obligations are carried out in a very unsatisfactory manner. The Muthupet Union Board in Tanjore district, for example, has passed a resolution refusing to take up the administration of vaccination. (ii) Many union boards fail entirely to maintain unprotected lists. One indeed has passed a resolution to the effect that house-to-house vaccination should be done without fees, a procedure discountenanced in the rules issued under Sections 137 and 200 of the Madras Local Boards Act, 1920. (iii) Several of the presidents of union boards in Nellore district have refused to have vaccination notices served. The Government is requested to take due notice of such instances, and insist on the union boards and their presidents carrying out the obligations vested in them by statute. (c) It has become a perennial complaint of the District Health staffs that many village headmen neglect the duties assigned to them in G.O. No. 832-P.H., dated 23rd May 1923, regarding the proper maintenance of unprotected lists, and the assembling of children in suitable centres at the time of the vaccinators' and the Health Inspectors' visits. As the co-operation of the village headmen is essential for the proper conduct of vaccination in rural areas, the attention of all Collectors may be once more drawn to the difficulties experienced by the subordi- nate vaccination staff. (d) Another factor which retards vaccination work is the frequent failure of local officers to report outbreaks of small-pox, whilst more frequently reports are inordinately delayed. One or two of the worst examples may be quoted. In the Union of Melvisharam in North Arcot district, an outbreak of small-pox commenced in December 1924, causing over 150 attacks and 25 deaths, but not a single report was received from the revenue authorities up to the date of the submission of the District Health Officer's Annual Report on 25th May 1925. In the village of Karnatham in Vriddhachalam taluk, South Arcot district, the District Health Officer at his inspection found 87 attacks and 7 deaths due to small-pox during the previous two months, while none of the cases was reported by the village headman, though he had registered 3 small-pox deaths in the death register. These instances could be multiplied many times. It has been constantly emphasized in the Annual Reports of the Public Health Department that prompt notification of infectious disease is of the greatest importance in its prevention and control. Failure to submit reports, or delayed
5 submission of reports, amounts almost to criminal neglect, as by the time information reaches the public health staff the disease has frequently assumed unmanageable proportions. This should be brought home to the minds of village headmen and the subordinates primarily responsible for notification. (e) An obstacle to the progress of vaccination which is of recent origin, at any rate as far as this Presidency is concerned, but which neither the Public Health Department nor local bodies can afford to ignore, is the activity of anti- vnccinationists, although their presence has so far been felt only in one district. Whilst ignoring the history of smallpox in this country prior to and subsequent to the introduction of vaccination, they present sensational propaganda full of perverted statements and statistics, which cannot but have effect on the minds of the ordinary credulous villager unless an active counter-propaganda campaign is carried on. It has been represented by several Health Officers that their propaganda work is greatly handicapped for want of magic lanterns and slides. This equipment is not only necessary if the education of the people in health matters is to extend, but will be a very useful aid to district officers in their attempts to defeat anti-vaccinationists' activities. 10. Notwithstanding these disabilities, the number of vaccination operations performed during the year, namely, 2,033,997, is probably the highest figure recorded in the history of the Presidency. The sub-joined statement gives figures for the last three years :6 to the inadequacy of the sanctioned scales of pay. The decrease in Kurnool, although it is small, is regrettable, as smallpox was prevalent. It is reported by the District Health Officer that in the taluk of Nandyal which has the largest population, only one vaccinator is employed in spite of his repeated represen- tations. This Taluk Board has refused to declare vaccination compulsory or to increase its permanent staff, whilst it also declined to employ additional temporary vaccinators even although smallpox was prevalent. The special attention of Government is invited to the indifference displayed by this Local Board. 12. The results of primary and secondary vaccinations and re-vaccinations performed by the different agencies are set forth in the subjoined table along with the corresponding figures for 1923-24. It will be seen from this table that, compared with 1923-24, the percentage of success has increased by 4.6 in the case of primary and secondary vaccinations, 1.8 in the case of re-vaccinations, and by 2.0 when the total operations are taken into account. Since 1920-21, therefore, when the success-rate was only 59.6 per cent, continued improvement has been maintained. Number of successful vaccinations. Total number of successful vaccinations.

In many municipalities vaccination work is still very unsatisfactory, this being due not only to the want of effective supervision, such as can be exercised by a Health Officer, but also to the continued employment of unqualified men as vaccinators. The number of municipalities employing trained Health Officers is steadily increasing and improved supervision of vaccination may therefore be expected in these towns. Irrespective of the employment of a Health Officer, however, it is of the utmost importance that every vaccinator should possess the qualifications prescribed in G.O. No. 1167, L. & M., dated 4th April 1925. The suggestion is made to Government that Municipal Councils employing vaccinators not possessing these qualifications should be surcharged with the salaries of these subordinates. Until some such step is taken, it is doubtful if any improvement will be effected. 17. Infantile vaccination in municipalities.9 2,000,000 mark, whilst the success rate for primary vaccinations rose to the high figure of 94.6 per cent. Although smallpox continues to levy a considerable toll on human life, this is not surprising when one remembers the low success rates registered during the decade prior to 1922. The full benefit of the improved vaccination work of the last three years will only be felt in years to come, and only if the present degree of success can be maintained. Vaccination is still very backward in certain areas, and increase in both vaccination and health staffs is essential if the full benefits of protection are to be brought to these areas. Pro- posals for increases have been already submitted to Government and deserve favourable consideration. 22. Dr. R. Adiseshan, DIP. HYG. (Cantab), the Assistant Director in charge of Vaccination, has worked with enthusiasm and energy, and has made many useful suggestions for improving the administrative control of this branch of the Public Health Department's activities. To him and to the District and Municipal Health Officers, my best thanks are due. OOTACAMUND, A. J. H. RUSSELL, M.A., M.D., D.P.H., Major, I.M.S., 25th June 1925.

INDEX TO THE VACCINATION REPORT FOR THE TRIENNIUM ENDING 1925-26. PARAS. ADMINISTRATION ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 1REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR THE TRIENNIUM ENDING 1925-26. In the Vaccination Reports for the last three years, reference has been made to the desirability of transferring to District Boards the administration of vacci- nation in rural areas. In G.O. No. 2304, P.H., Mis., dated 13th November 1925, the Government, however, declined to accept this proposal, and the control of vaccination is still vested in Taluk and Union Boards, except in the Nilgiri district. The existing arrangement has numerous disadvantages. The policy of the individual Taluk Boards of the same district frequently varies to such an extent that the District Health Officer meets with administrative difficulties which would never arise if the control were vested in a single authority. Secondly, the inequalities in the pay and allowances of the vaccinators employed by different Taluk Boards cause difficulties in the transfer of vaccinators from one Taluk Board to another and prevent the exaction of a uniform standard of work. Other defects will be mentioned in later paragraphs of this report, but so much incon- venience has been experienced that almost every District Health Officer has pressed for the transfer of the control of vaccination to the District Board. For this reason, the question deserves reconsideration at the hands of Government. 2. Glycerine lymph, which was introduced as an experimental measure during the triennium ending 1922-23, was found to give such consistently satisfactory results that the manufacture of lanoline lymph was entirely given up from 1923. 3. Revised instructions for the use of vaccine lymph were issued to all officers of the department in the annexure to G.O. No. 241, P.H., dated 4th February 1926. 4. In 1925 and 1926, the vaccine lymph department of the King Institute carried out detailed investigation in connexion with the varying month-war success rates in each district over a series of years. It was found that certain changes in the prescribed off-season were essential if the most satisfactory results were to be obtained. The proposals made in this connexion by this office in consultation with the Director, King Institute, were approved by the Government in G.O No. 279, P.H., Mis., dated 12th February 1926, and the alterations have now been brought into force. 5. The vaccination off-season, as usual, was utilized for the scrutiny of vital statistics and vaccination records, and the detection of unregistered births and deaths and unprotected children. A great deal of work was done in this direction in 1925-26, e.g., nearly 22,000 unregistered unprotected children were discovered in Coimbatore district and 15,000 in North Arcot. The cases detected in other districts, although not so numerous, amounted in toto to many thousands. Whilst this is creditable to the Public Health staff, it is direct proof of the bad work of registering officers, whether village headmen or presidents of union boards. If these cases had not been detected, it is probable that a large number would have fallen victims to smallpox. It may also be pointed out in this con- nexion that registration work is often deliberately neglected because the regis- trars are confident that shortcomings will be made good by the Public Health staff. This pernicious practice should be taken severe notice of by the officers of the Revenue Department. As regards union boards, many fail to maintain their registers correctly and do not co-operate with the Public Health staff in connexion with the issue of the required notices to parents and guardians and the prosecution of defaulters. In addition, some few disown their responsibility and refuse to recognize the
2 obligations imposed on them by statute. If the proposal to place the control of vaccination in the hands of district boards were adopted, most of these difficul- ties would automatically disappear. Meantime, it is suggested that Government should issue a circular to all union boards on the subject. In municipal areas, the off-season detection of unrecorded births and unpro- tected children was generally unsatisfactory, although many of the municipal registers showed grave deficiencies. With the increased employment of Munici- pal Health officers, gradual improvement may be anticipated. 6. The delegation of powers to Health Officers in matters of Public Health administration, including vaccination, has been a vexed question during the triennium under review. This would not be so keenly felt by Health Officers, if the presidents and chairmen accepted their recommendations. Unfortu- nately, even in matters affecting discipline, reasonable requests are ignored, as the following instances show. In the case of Hospet Taluk Board, the District Health Officer is not permitted to grant even casual leave to vacci- nators, whilst the President sanctions leave without the Health Officer's knowledge, so that lymph is wasted. The same President has himself taken charge from his vaccinators after granting them privilege leave; and has delayed the supply of equipment because he is of opinion that the old scarifying knife is as good as the new rotary lancet. In Dharmavaram taluk, the President gave five increments at a time to a vaccinator in spite of the District Health Officer's objection. In Chicacole Taluk Board area, unqualified men have been appointed, although qualified candidates are available. Vaccinators are also granted leave without reference to the District Health Officer ; they are permitted to corre- spond directly with the President, and are paid in full in spite of the District Health Officer's recommendations regarding recovery of the cost of wasted lymph. Finally, in Palladam taluk, the District Health Officer for obvious reasons recommended the removal from service of an unqualified vaccinator suffering from chronic intractable eczema. The President, Taluk Board, gave him six months leave, and at the end of the period sent him with a requisition to the District Medical Officer (without the District Health Officer's knowledge and without furnishing particulars of the case) asking his opinion if the disease was contagious. On receipt of a negative opinion, the vaccinator, still suffering from eczema, was taken back into service. These examples afford sufficient indication of the difficulties experienced by Health Officers in vaccination administration. Unless local bodies are prepared to trust their Health Officers, give due consideration to their advice, and, at least, give them disciplinary powers over the subordinate staffs, it will be very difficult to effect improvements. 7. The office of Assistant Director of Public Health (Vaccination) was held by Dr. R. Adiseshan from the 1st April to 31st August 1925, by Dr. Matthew from 1st September to 31st October 1925, and by Captain N. R. Ubhaya during the rest of the official year. The subjoined statement shows the inspections carried out by these officers. Dr. R. Adiseshan. Date. 1925. Remarks. 7th to 11th April Inspection of vaccination in Negapatam and M3 Date. 1925.

Proposals for the employment of additional Health Inspectors were not accepted during 1925-26, but the Government has since sanctioned the entertain- ment of thirty-two additional Inspectors, and this increased staff should go far to remove many of the difficulties experienced in past years. 10. It is to be regretted that, notwithstanding repeated instructions, local bodies, both Municipal and District, persist in retaining unqualified and incom- petent men as vaccinators. Many of these have been characterized by Health Officers as not only inefficient and incapable of improvement, but a positive danger to the community. If any untoward incident occurs as a result of their ignorance and carelessness, the local body concerned may be held liable for heavy damages. In the interests of the health and safety of the public, the qualifications laid down in G.O. No. 1167, L. and M., dated 4th April 1925, should be enforced, and local bodies at default should be surcharged. Unless some such drastic step is taken, the chances of improving vaccination staffs are remote. 11. The compartmental system of control of vaccination was in force throughout the Presidency in 1925-26, except in Gunupur Range in Vizagapatam Agency. In the Nilgiri district, it had to be suspended on account of the inadequacy of the vaccination staff, and the frequent and scattered outbreaks of smallpox. 12. Some of the factors retarding progress were discussed in the vaccination report for 1924-25. They continued to operate in 1925-26, and may be again made the subject of brief comment. (1) In many parts of the Presidency, vaccination is still non-compulsory, and notwithstanding the propaganda work carried out, it is very difficult to secure the vaccination of all unprotected children in those areas. Moreover, where there is no compulsion, the vaccinator has no legal locus standi and is not supported by local bodies, if he is molested or if his work is interfered with. Instances of such interference are not uncommon, and on occasion vaccinators have even been assaulted. The urgent necessity for the introduction of compulsory vaccination throughout the Presidency cannot be over-emphasized, and Govern- ment is once more requested to address all District Boards in the matter. (2) Even where vaccination is compulsory, the regulations are seldom enforced. A number of District and Municipal Health Officers have laid special stress on this defect and, finding themselves unable to overcome the indifferent attitude of the local authorities, have pressed for the delegation of plenary powers. These have been granted to the District Health Officer, Ganj5 13. (1) Vaccination in districts.6 to be met with. Probably, these are now more difficult to obtain. As regards the interference of cholera epidemics with vaccination work, it is hoped that with the additional Health Inspectors recently recruited, the necessity for deputing vaccinators for preventive work will not ordinarily arise. The attention of Government is once more drawn to the repeated failure of local bodies to fill up temporary vacancies in the vaccination staff. No difficulty would exist in getting qualified men for either temporary or permanent vacancies, if local bodies offered suitable salaries. A decline in the incidence of smallpox is not an accept- able excuse for reduction in vaccination operations. All Health Officers should constantly remind their subordinate staffs of the importance of a regular re-vaccina- tion campaign. (2) Excluding the Nilgiris district, where the rate of successful vaccina- tions per mille of population was 110.5, the rates in other districts varied from 25.2 in South Arcot to 38.2 in Salem and 39.4 in the Agency. Compared with the previous year, only six districts registered an increase, the most important being the Nilgiris (+39.0), R7 Ootacamund and Pollachi with increases ranging from 500 to 700. The largest decreases were returned by Madras (8 Establishment. Number of successful vaccinations. Total number of successful vaccinations. 1923-24. 1924-25. 1925-26. Primary vaccination.

A general reduction in the percentage of success for re-vaccinations has occurred, but too much importance cannot be attached to this because of the varying degrees of immunity met with in the individuals concerned. Compared with the previous triennium, the results attained in the period under review are very favourable. The following table gives comparative figures :9 17. The King Institute, Guindy, continued to supply all the vaccine lymph required for the Presidency, and glycerine lymph only was used throughout the triennium. The percentages of success for the different administrative areas of the Presidency are given in the following table :10 three less than 4,000 and two less than 5,000. In some cases, the shortage in inspections has been explained by the presence of cholera epidemics. Due notice will be taken of those cases where no satisfactory explanation has been given. (2) The number of cases inspected by Municipal Health Officers (excluding Madras Corporation) ranged from 461 in Coonoor to 14,269 in Madura. Ten Health Officers verified more than 75 per cent of the cases (the minimum prescribed in the Public Health Code), four inspected between 65 and 75 per cent and nine between 50 and 65 per cent. Those in the latter two groups will be asked to explain the shortage. (3) In municipalities not having Health Officers, the percentage of cases inspected varied from 33.3 in Bimlipatam to 100.0 per cent in Kodaik11 These facts clearly establish the protection afforded by vaccination, and this is still further exemplified in the following statements which give mortality rates among groups of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. (1) ANANTAPUR DISTRICT. Under one year, 112 (h) Though early diagonosis, prompt isolation of smallpox patients in suitable hospitals, effective disinfection, supervision of &quot; contacts,&quot; and other such public health methods are invaluable, they are no substitute for vaccination. 23. In letter No. 1250, Health, dated 4th September 1925, the Government of India required information regarding the number and situation of smallpox hospitals in the Presidency, the number of patients treated therein and their vaccinal condition, etc. Information on these points was called for, and the follow- ing figures have been consolidated from district reports. Only seven institutions exist for the isolation and treatment of smallpox patients in this Presidency. 1,292 cases were treated therein in 192 , but an additional 160 patients were accommodated in sheds provided for general infectious diseases. As regards the vaccinal condition of these 1,452 patients, details are available for only 1,411:[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]

In the matter of inaccurate registration all Collectors have been, requested in paragraph 4 of G.O. No. 241-P.H., dated 4th February 1926, to instruct the village headmen to co-operate with the health staff in vaccination work by keeping the vaccination registers up to date. It is unsatisfactory that in several cases union boards have failed to maintain their registers correctly and have not been prompt to assist the Public Health staff in the issue of notices to parents and guardians and the prosecution of defaulters. All Collectors are requested to issue strict instructions to their subordinate officers to ensure the despatch of immediate information to the Public Health Officers, whenever smallpox breaks out in any town or village within their jurisdiction. 5. The Director of Public Health suggests that the question of transferring the administration of vaccination in rural areas from Taluk Boards to District Boards should be reconsidered. The Government will consider the suggestion, if it is embodied in the proposals which the Director of Public Health has under consideration in connection with the framing of Public Health Act for this Presidency. 6. The Director reports that in the few cases in which sanction to prosecute offenders against the vaccination regulations has been obtained, the courts have only imposed very small fines, and he is of opinion that this has no deterrent effect at all. He is requested to bring specific eases to the notice of District Magistrates, or, if necessary, of the Government. 7. The suggestion of the Director that Act III of 1899 should be extended to all rural areas is separately under consideration. 8. The Government would invite the special attention of the Presidents of local boards to paragraph 6 of the Director's report, in which the Director quotes instances of the difficulties experienced by District Health Officers in vaccination work, and emphasises the need for closer co-operation between Presidents of local boards and the District Health Officers in the administration of vaccination, and the disciplinary control over vaccinators. The Government trust that, as already advised in G.O. No. 389, Public Health, dated 4th March 1926, all Presidents of local boards will give every consideration to the recommendations of District Health Officers in all matters relating to the vaccination staff. 9. The Government are glad to note that during the triennium under review there has been a very distinct advance throughout the Presidency in the success attending vaccination operations, mainly as a result of the introduction of the District Health Scheme and of the substitution of glycerine lymph for lanoline lymph for use in vaccination.

ANNUAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1926-27 MADRAS PRINTED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT, GOVERNMENT PRESS 1927
INDEX TO THE VACCINATION REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1926-27. PARAS. ADMINISTRATION ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 1ANNUAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1926-27. The administration of vaccination in rural areas still remains vested in taluk and union boards, and another year's experience has only emphasized the desirability, expressed in the last four vaccination reports, of transferring this public health function to district boards. In G.O. No. 1415-P.H., dated 13th August 1926, the Government suggested that this proposal should find a place in the draft Public Health Act which was then under contemplation. In a subse- quent order, however (G.O. Mis. No. 509-P.H., dated 23rd March 1927) the question of a Public Health Act was rejected in favour of amendment of the existing Local Self-Government Acts, and it is sincerely to be hoped that the draft amendments will include one dealing with the administration of vaccination. 2. Glycerine lymph was used throughout the Presidency during the year under report, and the results obtained have been uniformly satisfactory. 3. In accordance with a promise made by Government in the Legislative Council, revised instructions in the use of vaccine lymph were issued in G.O. No, 241-P.H., dated 4th February 1926, and no pains have been spared to ensure that vaccinators adhere strictly to these rules. 4. Routine vaccination work was as usual suspended during the four hottest months of the year. During this off-season, the vaccinators are expected to check vital statistics and vaccination records and to enrol all unregistered births and unprotected children is the respective registers. The detection work done by the Health Staff continues to give surprising results in every district and reveals the same old defects in the work of village headmen and Presidents of Union Boards, on whom devolves the maintenance of the vaccination and vital statistics records. In North Arcot and Coimbatore, as many as 15,000 unregis- tered and unprotected children were detected during the last off-season ; in South Arcot and Malabar the numbers totalled nearly 12,000, and, in Nellore, 11,000. Further comment as to the hazards run by the child populations of these districts seems superfluous, although it must be added that the increasing interest taken by Collectors and Revenue Officers in the registration of vital statistics has given promise of improvement in the future. 5. In spite of the remarks made by Government in their review of last year's report, many union boards still fail to maintain proper vaccination registers, still refrain from rendering the necessary assistance to the vaccination staffs and still fight shy of sanctioning the prosecution of defaulters. A few specific instances will indicate the difficulties met with. Out of 31 union boards in Tinnevelly District, no less than 22 are reported to have maintained their unprotected registers in a most unsatisfactory and perfunctory manner, whilst the union boards of Kulas2 6. In municipalities, the off-season work of vaccinators has, generally speaking, been more effectively supervised. During the year, three additional municipal Health Officers were entertained, and District Health Officers were, in G.O. No. 1393-P.H., dated 11th August 1926, made responsible for the supervision of vaccination and registration of vital statistics in municipalities having no Health Officers. The best results will, however, be impossible of attainment until every municipality has its own Health Officer. Under present circum- stances, the off-season work is very frequently neglected, and the vaccinators are employed on other duties. It is reported, for instance, that in one municipality the vaccinator was employed during the off-season in the preparation of electoral rolls. However important these may be to would-be municipal councillors, it is more importaut that the child population should be effectively protected, and the time spent by the vaccinator in tabulating voters would have been not only more usefully, but more legitimately, expended in preparing his unprotected registers. 7. Mention was made in last year's report of the lack of co-operation between the Presidents of Local Boards and District Health Officers in the matter of vaccination, and the Government in their review advised Presidents of Local Boards to give every consideration to the recommendations of these officers in this connexion. Local boards have, unfortunately, made little effort to follow that advice, and, as a rule, the recommendations made by Health Officers have been ignored. In a number of cases, the question has now become acute, and calls for the immediate delegation of powers of control to Health Officers both in the interest of discipline and of efficient work. For instance, the President of Hospet Taluk Board gave a vaccinator his full travelling allowance after the District Health Officer had recommended reduction because of waste of four successive supplies of lymph. In Bast G3 Captain N. R. Ubhaya, D.P.R.4 training course required for this qualification, so that if reasonably attractive- scales of pay were offered, there would be no lack of suitable applicants. Unfor- tunately many local boards decline to offer suitable salaries, and, as a result, they only obtain men who are otherwise unable to earn a living. 12. The Public Health Department has made every effort during the past three or four years to improve the district and municipal vaccination staffs, and in accordance with G.Os. No. 931-P.H., dated 2nd June 1926, and No. 569, L. & M., dated 1st March 1924, steps have been taken to inspect the work of all unqualified and undesirable vaccinators, so that a final recommendation might be made as to their retention or dismissal by the local boards concerned. Where exemption by the Director of Public Health is finally refused, payment of the salary has been declared illegal and surchargeable, and, in certain cases, it has been necessary to make use of this argument, before undesirables have been, finally got rid of. 13. Despite the orders of Government in G.O. No. 1415-P.H., dated 13th August 1926, only one or two District Boards have agreed to make vaccination compulsory. In view of the fact that in some districts smallpox still continues to break out in virulent form, it is to be hoped that the District Boards concerned will shortly see their way to adopt the repeated recommendations of the Public Health Department made in this connexion. In those areas where vaccination is compulsory, the regulations, of course, must be enforced, or progress will be slow. In Pattukkottai Taluk, for instance, of the 67 defaulters recommended for prosecution by the District Health Officer, Tanjore, not one was sanctioned by the Taluk Board President. Difficulties such as these would disappear if Presidents of Local Boards would delegate the power of sanctioning prosecutions to their District Health Officers. Delegation of powers in this connexion has been granted to the District Health Officers concerned by the President, Taluk Board, Uppinangadi, and the President, Taluk Board, Berhampur, and has been used successfully by these officers. It would be to the benefit of all concerned were the Presidents of other Local Boards to follow these examples. 14. In contrast with the complaints made in previous reports, it is pleasing- to be able to state that in certain districts the punishments awarded by the magistrates in respect of vaccination offences were so exemplary that a distinct improvement was secured in those areas. It is to be hoped that this change of attitude will spread rapidly over the whole magistracy in the Province. 15. Extension of Act III of 1899 throughout the Presidency has been constantly urged in previous reports, and the fact that very large numbers of unrecorded births and deaths are detected by the health staffs year after year emphasizes the need for the early introduction of this measure. In their review of last year's Vaccination Report, Government remarked that this subject was separately under consideration. It is requested that early orders on the subject may be issued. 16. The maintenance of village vaccination registers is still unsatisfactory in many instances, but health staffs have made constant efforts to rectify defects by making house-to-house enquiries in the villages they visit. 17. The anti-vaccination campaign in Tanjore District, which was alluded to- in last year's report, has developed in intensity, and was one of the main causes for the decreased numbers vaccinated in that district and for the wastage of large quantities of lymph. 18. With regard to the supply of equipment to vaccinators by Taluk Boards, it is to be regretted that in a number of instances the necessary purchases were inordinately delayed. The District Health Officer, Vizagapatam, reports that his indent for the supply of equipment has not yet been sanctioned by the Vizia- nagram Taluk Board although the last supply was made as far back as 1924, and similar delays have occurred in other districts. These difficulties would never arise if supplies were made in the first instance by the district boards and necessary adjustments made later between them and the taluk boards.
5 In this connexion, it may be noted that, in Ganj6 number of revaccinations all go to explain the rise in numbers. In Bellary and Kurnool, a change was made in the off-season months, and the vaccinators worked eight months as compared with seven months in the previous year. Moreover, vaccination was made compulsory in three taluks of Kurnool District. In Coimbatore District, one additional vaccinator was employed during the year under review. (2) The districts which recorded large decreases included G7 Twenty-eight municipalities returned decreased figures, the most outstand- ing being Madras ( 8 22.

No. 1432, P.H., 25th July 1927 Vaccination2 No. 1432, P.H., 25TH JULY 1927 lack of adequate supervision over the work of the vaccination staff. The muni- cipal councils concerned are requested to take early steps to rectify these defects. 5. In G.O. No. 1393, P.H., dated 11th August 1926, the District Health Officers were made responsible for the supervision of vaccination and the registration of vital statistics in municipalities in which there are no health officers. The strength of the inspection staff was also increased during the year under review by the employment of 32 additional health inspectors. The Director of Public Health reports that a further increase in the strength of the Health Inspectors' staff is necessary. As regards vaccinators the number of first- class men employed by local bodies fell from 202 to 195. The number of second- class vaccinators increased from 397 to 432, while that of probationary vacci- nators continued to decrease. The Director of Public Health reports that although trained men are now available, the full complement of vaccinators is maintained only in very few districts and that one of the reasons for this is the failure on the part of local boards to offer scales of pay sufficiently attractive to induce suitable applicants to accept Local Fund employment. The Government have recommended suitable scales of pay for adoption by local bodies and as the payment of salary to unqualified men who have not been exempted by the Director of Public Health or whose employment has not been sanctioned by the Government has been declared to be illegal and surchargeable, it is hoped that qualified men will be employed by local bodies in increased numbers on suitable rates of pay. 6. The Government are pleased to learn that the health staffs continued to do good work in detecting cases of unprotected and unregistered children. As many as 15,000 cases of unprotected children were detected in the North Arcot and Coimbatore districts, 12,000 cases in South Arcot and Malabar and 11,000 in Nellore. The maintenance of vaccination registers continued to be unsatisfac- tory in many unions. The Government note with regret the instances mentioned by the Director of Public Health in paragraph 5 of his report and they trust that presidents of the boards concerned will realize the obligation imposed upon them by the statute and take effective steps for the improvement of vaccination in the areas under their control. 7. In G.O. No. 1415, P.H., dated 13th August 1926, the Government emphasized the need for closer co-operation between Presidents of Local Boards and District Health Officers in the administration of vaccination and disciplinary control over vaccinators. The Director of Public Health points out that local boards have made little or no effort to follow this advice and that on the other hand the recommendations made by the Health Officers have often been ignored. The attention of the local boards concerned is invited to the instances quoted by the Director of Public Health in paragraph 7 of his report and the Government trust that they will in future work in closer touch with the Health Department and will give every consideration to the recommendations made by the District Health Officers in all matters relating to vaccination as directed in G.O. No. 389, P.H., dated 4th March 1926. In the interests of discipline and efficient work Presidents of Local Boards are also requested to consult the District Health Officer in all matters regarding the leave, transfers, appointment and punishment of vaccinators. The example of the Presidents of the Taluk Boards of Puttur and Berhampur in having delegated to their District Health Officers their power to sanction the prosecution of defaulters is commended to the Presidents of all Local Boards for adoption. 8. The Director of Public Health has again emphasized in his present report the desirability of transferring the administration of vaccination in rural areas from the taluk boards to the district boards. This suggestion will be considered when the amendment of the Local Boards Act is undertaken. In regard to the proposal that the Registration of Births and Deaths Act III of 1899 should be extended throughout the Presidency all Collectors have been requested in G.O. No. 2022, P.H., dated 11th November 1926, to submit proposals for the extension of the
No. 1432, P.H., 25TH JULY 1927 3 Act to such portions of their districts as they consider desirable and orders have been issued on the proposals so far received. 9. The Director of Public Health points out that only one or two district boards have agreed to make vaccination compulsory within their areas. The Government trust that all other district boards will further consider the question of adopting this course. (By order of the Government, Ministry of Local Self-Government) C. B.

INDEX TO THE VACCINATION REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1927-28. PARAS. ADMINISTRATION ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 1ANNUAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1927-28. The administration of vaccination in rural areas has been for a number of years vested in Taluk and Union Boards, but, in the interests of efficiency and uniformity of procedure, an amendment to the Local Boards Act has been suggested by the Public Health Department which, if accepted, will place vaccination in the hands of District. Boards. This proposal is unanimously supported by every officer in the Department. 2. The glycerine lymph in use has continued to give most satisfactory results, the percentage success-rate during the year under report being the highest ever recorded. 3. During the hot. weather, when routine vaccination is suspended for a period of four months, the health staffs carried out the usual scrutiny of vital statistics' and vaccination registers, and detection of unregistered births, deaths and unprotected cases. Reports go to show that grave defects still exist in many of the vital statistics' and vaccination records. In Coimbatore District as many as 37,461 unregistered unprotected cases were detected during the year; in Tanjore the number totalled 32,666; in Vizagapatam 20,137 ; in North Arcot 16,104; in Malabar 15,657, and in Kurnool 11,882. In view of these figures, it is requested that Government will once more impress upon all revenue authorities and Presidents of Union Boards the vital need for the correct maintenance of birth and vaccination registers. 4. &quot; Many Union Boards still fail to maintain proper vaccination registers, still refrain from rendering necessary assistance to the vaccination staffs and still fight shy of sanctioning the prosecution of defaulters.&quot; This sentence appeared in last year's report, and still unfortunately requires no amendment. Numerous specific instances can be quoted without fear of contradiction. Out of the 22 defaulting unions in the Tinnevelly District which were mentioned in last year's report, only ten have made any attempt to improve vaccination in spite of repeated instructions from the President of the District Board. Two of the Boards, viz., Puliangudi and Udangudi, even now do not maintain any register at all, and in others the registers are kept in most unsatisfactory fashion. In South Arcot District, no less than ten Union Boards out of 18 are reported to have maintained their &quot; unprotected cases&quot; registers in a very perfunctory manner, whilst the registers in Panruti, Nellikuppam and Porto Novo Unions are anything but satisfactory. In Gunt2 6. Despite the orders issued in G.O. No. 1432, P.H., dated 25th July 1927, the Presidents of certain local boards continue to ignore the recommendations of their District Health Officers in matters connected with vaccination.

(Camb.), Asst. Director of Public Health, Vital Statistics5 work was found to have attained a reasonable standard. In every case, full consideration has been given to long service, improvement in work after refresher courses of training, etc., before exemption was finally refused and before Presi- dents of Taluk Boards were informed that further employment of the individuals concerned would result in the surcharge of their salaries. These efforts of the Public Health Department to effect much-to-be-desired improvements have, unfortunately, been frequently misunderstood by local bodies, and the extreme step of refusing further exemption to unqualified vaccinators has, therefore, been adopted only when other methods have failed to effect the desired result. 12. Vaccination is now compulsory in the districts of West G6 17. Vaccination in districts.7 (2) The districts which recorded large decreases include Tinnevelly (-7,171), Ganj8 With the exceptions of Cuddapah, Rajahmundry, Vizianagaram and Vizaga- patam, none of these towns have Health Officers, so that it may be assumed that vaccination work received little or no supervision. A Health Officer has recently been appointed in Conjeeveram, and most of the other towns in the list are in urgent need of the technical services of such an officer. (3) The recorded percentage of successful infantile vaccinations to total births ranged from 29.8 in Chidambaram to 100.0 in Tirupati. This latter figure was also returned by Tirupati in last year's report, where attention was invited to the obvious error. Apparently the Chairman has failed to notice the remark. In eight other municipalities, viz., Adoni, Bodinayakkanur,. Cochin, Ellore, Nandyal, Peddapuram, Vellore and Srirangam, percentages of over 90 were also returned. In these nine towns infantile mortality rates vary from 1009 Establishment. Ratio per cent of successful cases. Ratio per cent of total successful cases. 1926-27. 1927-28. Primary vaccination.

The small decrease in the success rate for revaccinations is again entirely due to the very low figure obtained by local fund vaccinators. 21. The percentages of success for the different administrative areas in the Presidency are given in the following table :10 The slight increase in the cost per case is partly due to the employment of additional Health Inspectors and vaccinators, and partly to decreases in the number of successful vaccinations in certain districts. The average cost per successful case varied from Re. 0-4-10 in Vizagapatam to Re. 0-9-2 in Cuddapah district. In municipal areas, the average cost ranged from a minimum of Re. 0-3-3 in Calicut to a maximum of Rs. 1-8-7 in Palacole. Attention has already been drawn to the very unsatisfactory vaccination work done in Palacole, and the high cost, which is a natural consequence of a low success-rate, was further enhanced by the inclusion of the leave allowances of the vaccinator, for whom no substitute was appointed. The Director of the King Institute reports that he issued lymph for 2,063,925 cases to district boards and municipalities against 1,945,944 operations performed in these areas. The difference of 117,981 represents a wastage of 5.7 per cent which is only slightly above the permissible percentage. 23. (a) The number of vaccinated cases inspected by District Health Officers ranged from 839 in Tanjore to 6,326 in South Arcot. Two District Health Officers inspected less than 1,000 cases, 7 less than 2,000, 8 less than 3,000, 4 less than 4,000, 2 less than 5,000, 1 less than 6,000 and 1 less than 7,000 cases. The low figure in Tanjore was entirely due to the continued prevalence of cholera in that district. (b) The inspection of vaccinated cases by Municipal Health Officers (exclu- ding Madras) ranged from 618 in Hindupur to 14,689 in Madura. The work of seven Health Officers fell short of the prescribed minimum of 75 per cent and their explanations have been called for. (c) In the 45 municipalities where no Health Officers are employed, the percentage of cases inspected by the Medical Officers in charge of vaccination varied from 23.5 in Cannanore to 99.3 in Kodaik[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Survey Office, Madras. 1928.
11 of advantage to make revaccination temporarily compulsory in infected areas, and Government is requested to give every consideration to this suggestion. With this additional weapon, and with more prompt notification of outbreaks, there seems to be no reason why-this loathsome disease should not be finally eradicated. Although every district was infected at one time or another during the year, only two districts reported severe epidemics, South Arcot recording 1,165 and Tanjore 668 deaths. Only 565 deaths from smallpox were registered in municipal areas, and nearly one half of this total occurred in the two towns of Virudunagar (109) and Tinnevelly (99). No other municipality recorded more than 30 deaths, and-34 municipal towns remained entirely free throughout the year. In the districts of South Arcot, Coimbatore, Ganj12 ANNEXURE A.

No. 1703-P.H., 21st August 1928 Vaccination2 No. 1703-P.H., 21ST AUGUST 1928 The number of children successfully vaccinated increased from 639,827 to 689,422. Some doubt is thrown, however, upon the absolute correctness of these totals by the Director of Public Health who reports that the figures relating to infantile vaccination appear to be incorrect in the case of Tirupati and eight other municipalities. The attention of the municipal councils concerned is invited to the remarks of the Director of Public Health in paragraph 18 (3) of his report and they are requested, if the Director's suspicions are well founded, to exercise greater care and supervision in the preparation of their returns. 4. The number of first-class vaccinators employed by local bodies rose from 195 to 208 and of second-class vaccinators from 432 to 459 during the year under review. The number of probationers again declined from 128 to 100. The Director of Public Health considers that if a satisfactory standard of work is to be reached, more first-class vaccinators should be appointed and the disbandment of probationers should be accelerated. The Government trust that local bodies will cease to employ unqualified men and succeed in recruiting more first-class vaccinators by offering them reasonable salaries. The strength of the inspection staff has also been increased during the year under report by the appointment of a District Health Officer and four Health Inspectors for the new district of West GNo. 1703-P.H., 21ST AUGUST 1928 3 the disease. The Director of Public Health is requested to submit this proposal separately for consideration by the Government. 8. The Government regret to note that, in spite of the orders issued from time to time, the presidents of certain local boards have shown little disposition to co-operate with the District Health Officers or to accept their advice in matters connected with vaccination. Vaccinators are for the most part still appointed, transferred and granted leave without consulting the District Health Officers concerned and local bodies generally seem reluctant to delegate to these officers any powers in such respects, although wherever local boards, as in the case of Bellary and GhumsAGENTS FOR THE SALE OF MADRAS GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS.

INDEX. PARAS. ADMINISTRATION ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 1REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY FOR THE TRIENNIUM ENDING 1928-29. 1. The proposal for the transference of the administration of vaccination from the taluk and union boards to the district board which has been urged in the Vaccination Reports of the last six years has, according to the suggestion in G.O. No. 1415, P.H., dated 13th August 1926, been included in the draft amend- ments to the Local Boards Act. It is hoped that these amendments including the one relating to vaccination will be passed into law at an early date. 2. Glycerine lymph was used throughout the triennium under report, and the results obtained have been quite satisfactory. 3. The suspension of routine vaccination work was, as in previous years, utilized by the health staffs for intensive investigation of vital statistics and the detection of unprotected cases. During the triennium, about 2.5 lakhs of un- registered births and nearly a million unprotected cases were discovered. Of these, the detections during 1928-29 amounted approximately to 77,000 births and 316,000 unprotected cases. The districts from which large numbers of unregistered events were reported were Coimbatore (about 40,000), Tanjore (31,000), East G2 headman of a village in Nuzvid Division did not report the occurrence of smallpox which had been prevalent therein for nearly eight months when the vaccinator detected the presence of the epidemic on the occasion of his routine visit. It is to be regretted that the punishment awarded to the village headman consisted of only a black-mark. The District Health Officer of Trichinopoly brings to notice that, in at least four instances, smallpox was prevalent in a virulent form and that the first report was received by him only after the almost complete subsidence of the epidemic. These instances can be multiplied. As pointed out in paragraph 18 of the Annual Report on Public Health for the year 1928, considering the disastrous consequences arising from such belated intimations, it is the duty of the revenue authorities to take necessary action to minimise these delays by issuing warnings and imposing deterrent punishments on the worst delinquents. 6. Partly as a result of the failure to send daily reports and partly due to the errors in compilation, serious discrepancies continue to occur between the epidemic mortality figures contained in the Collector's returns and the reports forwarded to the Health Department by Tahsildars. The following are illustrations :3 account of the increased attention devoted to primary and secondary vaccination, the incidence of smallpox is becoming gradually shifted from the younger to the older ages. As the immunity conferred by successful infantile vaccination begins to wane after a period of about 74 Dr. A. Thirumalaiah.5 15.

The percentage of successful infantile vaccination in 1928-29 to the registered births varied from 25.2 in G9 23. Excluding Karaikudi, the rate of successful vaccinations per mille of population ranged from 19.9 in Palakole to 71.6 in Proddatur. Although Calicut returned a rate of 109.3 it may be ignored from consideration on account of the unreliability of the vaccination records. The rates were below 30 per mille in Chidambaram (29.4), Parlakimedi (28.5), Tadpatri (28.3), Tirupati (27.4), Gudiy10 The average cost per successful case varied from Re. 0-4-4 in Malabar to Re. 0-11-6 in Cuddapah District. In municipal areas, the average cost ranged from 'Re. 0-2-5 in Calicut to Rs. 1-9-0 in Palakole. Reference to the latter place was made even in last year's report and the high cost is presumably due to the comparatively low outturn of work and the low success rate. 27. The number of vaccinated cases inspected in 1928-29 by District Health Officers ranged from 739 in Cuddapah to 6,393 in Malabar. Three District Health Officers inspected less than 1,000 cases, 13 less than 2,000, two less than 3,000, four less than 4,000, two less than 5,000 and one less than 7,000. As most of the District Health Officers were engaged on cholera preventive work, the number of inspected cases has fallen during the year. In the case of municipalities having Health Officers, the number of inspec- tions ranged from 351 in Hindupur to 15,393 in Madura. The work of 12 Health Officers fell short of the prescribed minimum of 75 per cent and their explanations will be called for. The total number of operations and the number of cases inspected by District and Municipal Health Officers are given in Annexure C of the report. In the 43 municipalities where no Health Officers are employed, the percent- age of cases inspected by the medical officers in charge of vaccination varied from 17.4 in Chittoor to 99.4 in Bimlipatam. Thirty-one medical officers inspected more than 75 per cent, five between 65 and 75 per cent, three between 50 and 65 per cent and the rest four below 50 per cent. The attention of the Surgeon-General will be invited to the instances in which the inspection rates are low. District Medical Officers and Civil Surgeons inspected 11,572 cases against 7,979 cases in 1927-28. Two hundred and thirty-one Health Inspectors inspected more than 85 per cent of the cases and 52 failed to reach the prescribed minimum. Suitable action will be taken against those Health Inspectors whose explanations for the shortage in inspection are unsatisfactory. 28. The mortality from smallpox during the last seven years is given in the following statement:11 30. Thirty-five municipal towns were entirely free from smallpox ; the rest reported in all 1,537 deaths during the year. The mortality was high in Madras (391), Calicut (345) and Mann12 in sheds provided for infectious diseases in general. Information regarding vaccinal condition could be ascertained only in 1,302 patients.13 ANNEXURE A.

The essential point which should receive the attention of local bodies in the interests of efficient administration of vaccination is the provision of an adequate vaccination staff adequately paid. The number of first-class vaccinators employed during 1928-29 was 20 less than the number employed in the previous year and this is to be regretted. The example of Malabar in having appointed a female vaccinator for the gosha community is commended to other local bodies. 6. The conduct of vaccination in non-compilsory areas is reported to be unsatisfactory. The remedy suggested is to make vaccination compulsory in these areas. The district boards concerned are requested to take up the question for consideration as early as possible.
