The average cost of each successful vaccination in different States varied from 10 pies in Sirohi to 147 pies in Jaisalmer which is due to the fact that there is only a small population living in villages scattered over a large area. 40. During the year under report a revised scale of pay of vaccinators was introduced in the Eastern Rajputana States according to which a vaccinator can by degrees rise to R15 a month, the maximum pay previously being R12 per mensem. 41.

Except patients are under control in an institution or belong to the better class the full results of the Nastin treatments are difficult to gauge, certainly all patients expressed a marked feeling of well being during the course, acid fast bacilli could still be found in the ulcerations up to the submission of the report.&quot; 63. All Medical Officers serving in Rajputana have been asked to try the treatment and report the results. RELAPSING FEVER. 64. There was a mild outbreak of this disease in the jail, regiments and in the City of Alwar. The Agency Surgeon, Alwar, reports that &quot; the disease was of a severe type and was easily diagnosed by the recognition of the spirochocts in the blood. It is of interest to note that the occurrence of the disease coincided with the outbreak of an epidemic of bugs but the careful examination of many of these insects failed to reveal the parasite in their intestine.

CANCER. 66. Reports on cancer investigation have been necessarily incomplete owing to local difficulties in research and no remarks of any special value can be deduced from them. PLAGUE. 67. During the year from 1st April 1910 to 31st March 1911, 38,809 cases of plague and 32,523 deaths were reported and 871 towns and villages were infected in Rajputana including Ajmer-Merwara District as compared with 30,549 cases and 26,223 deaths and 627 towns and villages in 1909-1910. The percentage of total plague deaths of population was 1.32, vide table attached against 0.99 in the previous year. 68. Twelve thousand one hundred and thirty two anti-plague inoculations were done during the year under report at the following places :DISPENSARIES IN RAJPUTANA. 7 was in existence in the Ajmer District throughout the year excepting in June and July but totally disappeared from Merwara in May. It was most prevalent in April 1910. 70. People are learning the value of evacuation of infected quarters and generally leave their houses of their own accord when dead rats appear about. This early evacuation is naturally more freely practised in the villages than in the towns. 71. Considering the high degree of immunity afforded by inoculation it is remarkable that people are still so reluctant to avail themselves of this valuable protection. 72. The special staff engaged on plague duty in the Ajmer-Merwara District was abolished on 1st July 1910, with the exception of one Sub-Assistant Surgeon for duty in the Plague Camp at Ajmer as well as to visit infected villages, to inoculate and advise the inhabitants regarding sanitation generally. 73. The plague Inspecting Staff at the Ajmer railway station was also aboli- shed on the 16th September 1910, as its existence was not considered of much value in view of the fact that the Ajmer and Merwara Districts are surrounded by Native States generally plague infected and that the disease is introduced chiefly by apparently healthy persons by means of infected fleas in their bedding and clothing. 74. Disinfection continued to be practised as before. Houses or quarters are emptied, the floors treated with kerosine emulsion, walls are whitewashed, light and air being admitted as far as circumstances permit. Native States. 75. There were 37,820 cases of plague and 31,605 deaths reported from Native States during 1910-1911 against 21,803 cases and 18,294 deaths in 1909-1910. 76. The epidemic affected 14 States and 776 towns and villages including the Deoli Cantonment against 10 States and 431 towns and villages in the previous year, i.e., out of 19 Native States in Rajputana from which returns are received only 5 States were free from the disease. 77. Jaipur.8 PLAGUE IN RAJPUTANA. 85. The disease was in existence in Mewar, Alwar and Marwar throughout the year as well as in Jaipur and Bharatpur except in July and August. It is still in existence in a less degree in these States. 86. In the infected villages of the Native States, evacuation, disinfection and segregation was carried out, also freely airing and exposing to the sun all garments, bedding, grain, etc., removed from evacuated houses. Evacuation was the most popular of the methods employed against the disease and was readily resorted to by the villagers when rats were found dying or plague appeared. 87. Inoculation was carried out in the places mentioned above (paragraph 68) but was steadily opposed by the majority of the people in the Native States on account of their prejudices and ignorance of the connected facts with it. 88. Pamphlets in English and Vernacular were circulated and distributed widely throughout the towns and villages. 89. Measures for rat destruction can seldom be adopted in the Native States as the people are against the practice. 90.

From this statement it will be seen that 801,036 men, 285,965 women, 231,214 male children and 156,162 female children were treated as compared with 844, 158; 316, 887; 229, 747; and 154,412 respectively in the previous year. STATEMENT G. 92. During the year under report a total number of 68,446 operations were performed on 68,177 persons in Ajmer-Merwara and in Native States against 67,178 operations done on 66,969 persons in the previous year. The cures amounted to 67,356, the numbers relieved 332, discharged otherwise 181, and died 90 against 66, 180, 286, 182 and 81 respectively in 1909 while 218 remained under treatment on 31st December 1910 as compared with 240 in 1909. 93. Of the operations performed 1,460 were extractions of the lens for cataract of which 1,178 or 80.70 per cent. proved successful, 38 lithotomies, 145 litholapaxies and 189 amputations against 1,587 extractions of the lens for cataract, 48 litho- tomies, 149 litholapaxies and 158 amputations in 1909. 94. There were 375 abdominal operations performed of which 6 were laparo- tomy with 3 deaths 4 abdominal sections with 2 deaths, 15 for abscess of liver with 1 death and 28 hernia with 2 deaths. 95. It is worthy to note that the operative work during 1910 shows a satisfac- tory increase in spite of plague being epidemic during the greater part of the year. STATEMENT H. 96. Shows the income and expenditure of Government dispensaries and hospi- tals and the expenditure only on those in Native States. 97. The total income of hospitals and dispensaries in Ajmer-Merwara was R20,495 as compared with R19,686 in 1909, this increase is due to the fact that arrears of contribution were paid by certain Istimirardars and Jagirdars. The cash balance at the close of the year stood at R4,707. The value of the invested capital of the dispensaries in this division remained the same as in 1909. 98. In Ajmer-Merwara the total expenditure fell from R17,104 in 1909 to R15,866 in 1910 which shows a marked decrease in expenditure under head &quot; Dieting &quot; but the expenditure under heads &quot; Buildings and Repairs &quot; rose from R1,146 in 1909 to R1,296 in 1910. 99. The expenditure of the Victoria Hospital at Ajmer under head &quot; Building and Repairs &quot; rose from R598 in 1909 to R1,160 in 1910, owing to the cons- tructions of servants' quarters and certain improvements and repairs in the hospital building. Native States. 100. The total expenditure on hospitals and dispensaries in Native States of Rajputana rose from R363,854 in 1909 to R372,397 in 1910 which is due to increase under all heads except under column &quot; Dieting.&quot;

Of the total cost on hospitals and dispensaries in these States R76,973 were expended in Jaipur, R50,588 in Marwar, R40,095 in Bharatpur, R37,735 in Mewar, R37,313 in Kotah, R36,238 in Bikaner, R28,718 in Alwar, R10,785 in Tonk, R9,391 in Jhalawar, R8,043 in Dholpur, R5,669 in Karauli, R3,573 in Kishangarh, R3,481 in Dungarpur, R3,395 in Banswara, R3,310 in Sirohi, R2,423 in Jaisalmer, R2,326 in Bundi and R2,142 in Partabgarh. 102. The average cost of each case treated in Ajmer-Merwara and in the Native States hospitals and dispensaries was 43 pies and 52 pies respectively against 39 pies and 48 pies in 1909. 103. In accordance with the sanction of the Hon'ble the Agent to the Governor- General, Rajputana, the Government Sub-Assistant Surgeon was withdrawn on account of the financial position of the Kushalgarh Estate: no annual returns of dispensary and jail of the Estate for 1910 have been received. MISSION HOSPITALS. 104. During the year under report the number of Mission Hospitals in Raj- putana was the same as in 1909, viz., six. 105.

Civil Sub-Assistant-Surgeons. 139. On the 31st December 1910, there were 185 Government Sub-Assistant Surgeons on the rolls against the sanctioned strength of 195, there being 10 vacancies, 2 on the Government reserve list and 8 on the Native States reserve list. Out of 195 Sub-Assistant Surgeons, 23 were permanently employed on the Government List and 172 working in the Native States. There is now only one local class Native Doctor and one locally entertained Sub-Assistant Surgeon under this Department, against three and one respectively in 1909, two of the Native Doctors were replaced by qualified Government Sub-Assistant Surgeons owing to the transfer of one to the Vaccination Department in Mewar and to the death of another in Bharatpur. 140.

There were 170 in and 7,190 out-door patients treated as compared with 197 in and 9,595 out-patients in the previous year, this considerable decrease is due to the fact that there was no female Hospital Assistant in charge for about 8 months. 166.
