Under sanction of the Government of India the course of instruction has been extended by another year, and the status of the school raised to that of a college. Proposals to meet the new demands upon the College have been submitted and are under consideration. STIPENDS. 7. Class A.( 3 ) opportunities to the students of making themselves familiar with the contagious diseases which they will be called upon to diagnose. (Appendices VII, VIII, IX, and X). 16. At the request of the Director of Land Records and Agriculture, Bengal, the Commissioner of Police has sent one horse for treatment, and I hope he will send more, and through the courtesy of the Chairman of the Calcutta Corporation and also on Mr. Lyon's recommendation, 11 municipal bullocks suffering from rinderpest have recently been treated in the College Hospital. Although 8 of these bullocks died within a few hours of their admission into the hospital, owing to the cases being far advanced when sent, yet they afforded the students some further opportunities for clinical study of the disease, and as I hope arrangements will be possible whereby we shall be able to treat the cases earlier I look forward to a smaller death-rate in future. Two municipal ponies suffering from glanders were also admitted into the hospital. The students have also been to the Municipal Gowkhana to take temperatures of the cattle with the view of early detection of disease in connec- tion with the recent outbreak of rinderpest among the municipal cattle. The increase in the number of cases treated at the college( 4 ) The outstanding accounta of the year under report amount to Rs. 214-3-6, of which Rs. 164-8 have been realised since, and the balance, Rs. 49-11-6, is expected to be realised soon. The expenditure in feeding during this year exceeds that of 1897-98 by Rs. 661-0-6, which is due to the increase of patients and to the free treatment of a large number of them. The usual financial state- ment is appended (Appendix XII). HOSTEL. 23. The hostel continues to furnish a comfortable home for the students. Fifteen students in Class B and 7 in A were boarders during the year under report. Of the above 22 students, 1 was a Muhaminadan, 1 a Christian, and the remaining 20 were Hindus, most of them being of the Brahmin and the Kayasta community. The meals of the Hindu students are given together and the Muhammadan and the Christian students given separately. It will thus be seen that separate arrangements have been made for the meals of the Hindu, Christian, and Muhammadan students. As usual, there was a uniform course of dieting such as rice, ddl and such other things used in ordinary native families. There were fixed scales of diet, and the expenditure did not exceed the sanctioned grant for the year. The students took it in turn to make bazar purchases and watch the cooking of their meals. The hours for the meals of the students were between 9 and 10 in the morning and evening, and the tiffin was given between 3 and 4 p.m. 24. The medical officer in connection with the hostel attended his duties regularly throughout the year. The general health of the boarders was satisfactory. 25. The municipal filtered water main pipe has been connected with that of the hostel, and a source of great discomfort to the men has thus been removed. 96. The staff of the hostel was as last year, viz., one sub-assistant superintendent, 4 ward servants, 3 cooks, 2 sweepers, and one durwan. 27. Proposals have been submitted to Government to provide for the increased number of boarders which will have to be accommodated during the three years' course which has been sanctioned.

I append a complete list of the passed men of the Bengal Veterinary College, arranged according to seniority and showing their employment during the year 1898-99. (Appendix XIII). APPOINTMENT OP VETEKISTAKY ASSISTANTS. 29. Nanda Lal Gupta( 5 ) months' service left the place. The Subdivisional Officer reports that through his careful treatment the number of attacks and deaths, which was very great when he first came, greatly diminished and ultimately disappeared. In addi- tion to his other duties, he gave instruction to the public as to the best way of constructing cowsheds, and the manner of feeding the cattle, which had some effect in checking cattle disease. The public held a very good opinion of him. No account was kept of the number of cattle treated by him. He was also employed under the District Board of Saran from 23rd July to 12th September 1898, for combating cattle disease in the district. The Chairman reports that there was no means of finding out what public opinion was as regards his work. Fifty-two animals were treated by him, of which 36 were cured, 1 relieved, and 15 died (Appendix XIV). He served the Hatwa Raj with others under a senior lecturer for some time in testing the Raj horses with mallein. He also served under the District Board of Darbhanga from 29th October to 10th December 1898 to combat cattle disease. The Chairman of the Board reports that he was deputed to Naraya and Phulpara, but finding no disease went to Benipara and Bahera, and found a very small amount of cattle disease there. He found only 4 cases of rinderpest in the jurisdiction, two of which were cured and two relieved. (Appendix XIV). He was sent recently to Ranchi, but too late to be of use. Hemanta Kumar Roy( 6 ) he served he was employed in thana Jhargram, where there was an outbreak of cattle disease at the time. As he was in the district for less than two months, no definite opinion could be formed of the nature of the work done by him during that time. No statistics are available of the number of cattle treated. He was employed for some time by the Hathwa Raj in testing the Raj horses with mallein with others under the orders of a senior lecturer from this College. Ashu Tosh Biswas( 7 ) Satyendra Kumar Biswas( 8 ) year. The fall in number is due to the sudden transfer of the Veterinary Dispensary from its place of prosperity. The dispensary has again been removed to the head-quarters, the present building of which serves the purpose fairly well. The establishment of a shoeing forge is under the contemplation of the Board, as there is a great demand for it, and it is expected to be shortly opened. The total amount of receipts during the year under review was Rs. 1,514-2, of which Rs 805-11-9 were expended on the Veterinary Assistant's pay and travelling allowance, medicines, furniture, &c., &c., leaving a balance of Rs. 708-6-3 (Appendix XV)." Dumraon( 9 ) 37. Cuttack.( 10 ) The total number of animals treated at the dispensary at Burdwan during the year under report was 152. The number treated by the Veterinary Assistant in the interior of the district was 231 during the year. (Appen- dix XIV). Appended will be found a statement which shows in detail the income and expenditure of the veterinary dispensary during the year under report (Appendix XV). The Chairman also reports that from the remarks left by his predecessor on the tour diaries and from the reports of the present Veteri- nary Assistant, he was satisfied with his work. The dispensaries were inspected by me or by a member of my staff except the one at Burdwan. The Magistrate- asked that the inspection of that dispensary might be postponed, because the Veterinary Assistant was away at the time. Reports were duly forwarded. GLANDERS AND FARCY OPEEATIONS IN NORTH BIHAR. 41. In last year's report I mentioned that three Veterinary Inspectors were engaged under the Glanders Act in each of the three districts of Saran, Muzaffarpur, and Champaran, where there was an outbreak of glanders, to test horses with mallein. Besides these, two of the lecturers and the Veteri- nary Assistant attached to the Muzaffarpur Veterinary Dispensary were also gazetted as Veterinary Inspectors under the Act. In Saran, 342 horses were tested, including the 92 Hathwa Raj horses, of which 2 were found to be glandered; in Muzaffarpur 197 were tested and 4 were found to be glandered; and in Champaran 105 were tested, of which 4 were declared to be glandered. The operations have ceased in Saran and Muzaffarpur, and in Champaran they are expected to be shortly closed. Fortnightly progress reports were duly sent to the Director of Land Records and Agriculture, Bengal. A complete report will be submitted as soon as the operations come to an end. The expenditure on account of the glanders work during the year under report was Rs. 4,523-2-8, which includes the pay and travelling allowance of Veterinary Inspectors, price of mallein, temperature charts, syringes, &c. CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 42. In Calcutta.( 11 ) were (a) that injections of virulent blood and immune serum produced irregular results and were not recommendable for Bengal; (b), that injections of superim- munised serum as a treatment for rinderpest brought about more cures than ordinary medical treatment. I was also led to report that stronger serum than mine could be prepared, and that by taking the cases earlier, the percentage of cures could be increased. 45. Bile.( 12 ) measures I would advocate to develop this industry. In consultation with the District Officers, I was able to ascertain that mule-breeding is not possible in Bengal, because the prejudices of the people generally are dead against it. I thought at one time that Darjeeling might be used for mule-breeding, but the missionaries and other people I have sounded are not in theleast keen. DONKEY STALLION AT GUNTAK. 51. The Political Officer of Sikkim, under whose charge the donkey stallion " Charak" is being maintained, reports that during the year under review 10 mares were covered by the stallion (Appendix XIX) and that Rs. 199-4-7 were expended to meet the cost of his feed, keep, attendance, &c., which will be seen from Appendix XX. If this stallion turns out to be a foal-getter, many more mares will be brought to him. Mule-breeding in Sikkim is under a cloud just now, owing to the former stallion being useless. ARAB PONY STALLION AT BUXAR. 52. Babu Hardhyan Singh, who looks after the District Board pony stallion " Ruby," reports that during the year 1898-99 the stallion covered 57 mares, against 56 last year. (Appendix XXI). The result of cover- ings is not known, as many of the mares came from different places and different districts bordering Shahabad. But he says the stallion is very much appreciated, and his services are successful as far as is ascertained. The cost of feed and keep of the stallion during the year under report was Rs. 200-3-3, against Rs. 273 last year (Appendix XXII). CATTLE-BREEDING. 53. In Appendix XXIII will be found some information as to the results of coverings by several bulls supplied by this Department, and by the Department of Land Records and Agiculture, Bengal. During the year under report many requisitions for bulls were received, but as few good bulls could be procured, I have been unable to comply with them fully. 22. Bihari Brahmini bulls (Sitamarhi and Darbhanga), for which requisitions were made, were procured and supplied to the following persons:( 13 ) expense from other provinces. The first lot collected this year was fair, but the last was not good. Plenty of bad Behari Brahminis are obtainable, and there is no difficulty in collecting them, but the people object to their good bulls being caught. During the year I corresponded with the Manager of the Darbhanga Raj, and received permission to export some of the local Brahminis, but my Agent reported that those he saw were rather old and not up to the standard required. Mr. H. E. Abbott, of Shapur Undi Factory, rendered me assistance in securing bulls. Recently he procured 10 bulls for this Depart- ment, but they are not of such good stamp as I expected them to be. I do not like this system of exporting bulls from Behar, for though there are many bad ones there, I doubt if there be too many good ones. To export the bad ones for breeding purposes is not an advantage to the districts they are sent to: to export the good bulls is bad for Bihar. 56. I suggest that if we are to attempt to improve the cattle of the lower districts, we must do it by breeding our own bulls, and by distributing them in a proper systematic way. The same remarks applies to the import- ation of bulls from Hissar into Northern Bengal. Out of 8 Hissars imported last year, I castrated one, as he was not suited to improve any breed, and one purchased by Mr. Toomey has not covered a single cow throughout the year, nor will he go near one; and I think the Hissar Farm has not treated us at all well in this matter. It was never intended to establish a Hissar breed in North Bengal, but to use it to refresh the local one. Here, again, it would be much better if we were to breed our own bulls, and distribute them in Bihar, &c. If Hissars are to be purchased, it would be well if I went to the Farm and selected them myself. I have come to the conclusion that the attempts we make now to distribute bulls is not of much use, and we had better let the matter rest until we can breed our own bulls. 57.

( 4 ) APPENDIX IV. List of prizes awarded to the students of the Bengal Veterinary College. Serial No. Description of prize. Awarded for( 5 ) that it was, at his instance, raised to the status of a college. He was greatly impressed and very much surprised at the excellence of the arrangement of the school in which they were. It was the most practical thing he had seen in Bengal outside the walls of the Sibpur College, and he was so pleased with the practical usefulness of the instruction given here that he had no longer any hesitation in advising the Government of India to complete the system by allowing the students to be taught for three years, and to give the graduates the status of a degree. The school had made very considerable progress in many directions, and one had been in the increase of the size of the building connected with it and the branches appertaining to it. Mr. Lyon spoke of it as a modest school. His Honour would not call it an immodest school, but he would say that he had not seen in Bengal better buildings fitted for the purpose than these. One of the best things done in connection with the school was the building of a hostel for the students. The young students went there and were made comfortable. His Honour had satisfied himself that they were, and he hoped that the existence of a place where they might live with comfort and convenience, and where they were looked after by the Superin- tendent and staff, would do much to attract to the College a larger number of students in the future than even in the past. There had been, besides, an increase in the building, a remark- able increase in the number of animal patients, and from which the students got their best practical clinical lessons. It was a remarkable story which the Principal had told them of how in six years the number of animals treated in this hospital had risen from 104 to 1,041. That showed that the people in the neighbourhood were more interested and more confident in the character of the treatment received, and nothing was better for a number of young students learning a practical science than to have these opportunities of clinical knowledge. In another matter the success of this school was unique. The number of passes were formerly not very distinguished; half the boys used to fail: all the students have passed this year. It was perhaps just as well that all the students should not pass. He thought it might be supposed that the examinations then were more rigid than they were now, but the examiners were very much the same now as they were three years ago, and he had no doubt the exa- mination was conducted under the same system with the desire of testing the actual practical knowledge of the students, just as was done three years ago when the percentage of passes was not so good. His Honour was particularly pleased to hear what the Principal had told them about the number of students who succeeded in after-life. The aim of the school was to prepare the students for their duties in after-life, and if they did not succeed, the institution would not have the success its friends would like it to have. But when they found that nineteen out of thirty-five had all recently got employment, and that those who had not got Government employment were already in private practice, he thought they had done a great achievement. There was no other school in Bengal which had been so successful in this way as the Sibpur College. If the people came to know the advantages of the treatment of animals afforded at the institution, the increase would be still greater. That was the result which had been attained at the Sibpur College, and he was confident the same results were going to follow" here at Belgatchia. His Honour then referred to the report, and said that one of the things he wanted to speak to them about was riding. He had an opportunity of seeing how well some of them rode when he was here in August last. The Principal had borne testimony to the improvement in the activity and energy of the students since the riding lessons were introduced. These were lessons which it became young students here to learn. There were other lessons which they learned there which were invaluable to them in after- life. One learned as one got older that it was not only by mild and gentle measures that they could succeed in relieving disease. Sometimes diseases could only be relieved by sharp and, what seems to an outsider, cruel remedies. There was one other thing which struck His Honour in this report, namely, the entire absence of Muhammadan students here. He anti- cipated that Muhammadans would have come readily to a school of this kind, and he thought there must be some sort of misunderstanding on the part of the Muhammadan community that they did not come forward readily. He hoped that before long some Muhammadans would enter into the competition for themselves, and show that Muhammadans are not behind Hindus in this work of charity and sympathy. Now, there was one word he wanted to say to the students in the presence of their Principal, and that was to congratulate them upon the share they had with him in two very important experiments during the year. One of them was the experiment the Principal had conducted with mallein. Only the other day there was a Bill before the Legislative Council of the Viceroy in which strong powers were given to In- spectors for the suppression of glanders, and that every horse suffering from glanders should be destroyed Major Raymond brought forward his proposal to show that, by treatment under mallein, it was possible to save horses suffering from glanders which would otherwise have been destroyed. At any rate, in the Bill the test of mallein was to be introduced before horses suffering from glanders were destroyed. The other experiment was in regard to rinder- pest. Mr. Lyon had spoken of the terrible loss caused to agriculturists by this terrible disease. Major Raymond and other gentlemen, in a lesser degree, have been carrying on experiments in this direction, and His Honour wished him success in the experiments he was now carrying on. In conclusion, His Honour said that there were few departments in which he had been more impressed with the progress that had been made than in the Veterinary Department. Students had begun every year to be better taught; every year a larger number of students were sent out into Bengal to carry out these measures for the preservation of cattle ; every year there was more, and would be more, sympathy for the young students who are being turned out by the school; every year they would be receiving more and more support from the outside world, and the school was getting even more and more distinguished for its progress in the diagnosis and treatment of the diseases of dumb animals.

Remarks by the Civil Veterinary Department. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Sitamarhi ... ... 2 Muzaffarpur ... ... March 1896 ... ... Cossipur and Chitpur Muni- cipality. The Secretary to the municipality reports that two of the bulls died, and that the one living served 20 cows during the year. It has shown much improvement on the local breed and the people have much appreciat- ed it. 1 Ditto ... ... April 1898 ... ... Ditto ... ... ... 2 Ditto ... ... September 1895 ... Hitampur Raj, Birbhum ... The Manager reports that during the year under review about 250 cows were served by the two bulls. There is some improvement on the local bleed, i and the bulls are gradually being appreciated by the people. Ditto ... ... ... 3 Ditto ... ... November 1895 ... Are let loose among the herds at Dum-Uum. The Chairman of the Dum-Dum Municipality reports that nothing is known of the bulls. Ditto ... ... ... 1 Ditto ... ... May 1898 ... ... Tikari Raj ... ... ... The Manager reports that the bull was of no use ... ... ... ... ... Subsequently the bull was reported to be covering country cows. Ditto ... ... ... 1 Ditto ... ... July 1898 ... ... Narsingpur estate, Augul ... The Manager of the Narsingpur estate reports that the bull was supplied to some cowherds and to some other persons on requisition, and from their statement it appears that up to 31st March 80 to 100 cows were served. The services of the bull having been utilised for about 8 months only, the Mannger thinks it too early to say if there is any improve- ment on the local breed of cattle. From the requisition which the people are nowadays making of their own accord, the Manager is led to believe that it is being gradually appreciated. Ditto ... ... ... Ditto ... ... July 1898 ... ... Pal Lahera estate, Angul ... The Manager reports that 10 cow9 were served by the bull, all of which are pregnant. As no calves have yet been born, no remarks can be made regarding the improvement of the local breed of cattle. The people appreciate the bull, but their appreciation will be fully expressed after the birth of calves. The bull appears to be well suited to the local breed of cattle. Ditto ... ... ... 1 Ditto ... ... July 1898 ... ... Baraæba estate, Argul ... The Mannger reports that the bull is a fine specimen of Sitamarhi bull, and hopes that it will improve the cattle by cross-breeding ; but owing to its Size, being smaller than some o the local bulls available, it is not so much appreciated by the people, who understand very little the benefit to be derived by cross-breeding. The bull was kept for more than two months under proper care, but as very few persons bring their cows to be covered by it, it has been left to graze with the minor Raja's cattle in pastures under the care of the Raja's cow-keeper. During the first two months it was kept separate in a house of its own. It covered four cows only, and since it has been left to move with the Raja's cattle, it has during the six months from October to March covered eight cows belonging to the Raja's herd, besides a good many other cows belonging to the people that come on its way while grazing in the common pastures. The bull is only eight months there, and it is too early to ascertain the improvement it will create in the local breed of cattle. Ditto ... ... ... 1 Ditto ... ... November 1895 ... Ward's estate, Chittagong ... The General Manager reports that 18 cows were covered by the bull during the year 1898-99, of which 7 only have given birth to calves during the year, and the rest are in a pregnant state. The calves born appear to be much stonter and healthier than those of local breed. The bull is appre- ciated by the people. Durbhanga ... ... 2 Darbhanga ... ... January 1899 ... ... Collector of Pabna ... ... The Collector reports that of the two bulls supplied to him, one was sent to Sirajganj and the other kept in the Sadar subdivision, Thirty cows have been served by the former and 5 by the latter up to 31st March 1899. The people in the Sirajganj subdivision have begun to appreciate the services rendered by the bull, but the people of the Sadar subdivision still seem very apathetic about the matter and are not yet able to appreciate them. As these bulls have been supplied very recently, nothing definite as to results in the way of improvement of breeding cattle can be said now.
( 21 ) Sitamarhi ... ... 2 Muzaffarpur ... ... February 1896 ... District Board, Khulna ... The Vice-Chairman of the District Board reports that the bull maffitained at the Khulna Jail is dead. The Manager of the Morrelgunge estate, where the other bull is being main- tained, reports that he cannot tell exactly the number of cows served by him, as the bull is let loose among the cows in the field. No doubt the bull has improved the local breed of cattle. but as the cattle are smaller in size, many Traiyats who bring their cows to be covered, have to take them back on that account. Ditto ... ... ... 1 Ditto ... ... July 1808 ... ... Talcher estate, Angul .. The Manager of the estate reports that the hull belongs to a good caste, but the people have an idea that on account of its malia colour (sanguine complexion), its bullocks will not be strong and stout to work in the fields. In the head-quarters there is one bigger bull than the new one. and the people like to have their cows served by it. As the people do not willingly bring their cows to the bull, it is let loose in day-time to graze and mix with the cows. Some cows served by the bull have not yet given birth to any calf. Under such circumstances, it is not possible to say whether it has improved the breed of cattle. Ditto ... ... ... 2 Ditto ... ... Ditto ... ... Dhenkanal estate, Angul ... The Manages of the estate reports that nearly 30 cows have been served by each of the two bulls. As the cows served by the bull have not yet brought forth any issue whatever, it is not possible to say of the result, improve- ment and appreciation of the people on the local breed of cattle for the present. Ditto ... ... ... 1 Ditto ... ... 1896 ... ... Bubu Bhola Nath Ghoshal, land-holder, Bosonti. The land-holder reports that the bull has given birth to 10 bull-calves and eight cow-calves, all of which are strong and good-looking. The people liked the bull. It died in March. Ditto ... ... ... 4 Ditto ... ... December 1898 ... District Board, Backergunge The Chairman reports that the four bulls have been kept in the four sub- divisions. They served only nine cows up to the 31st March. The bulls are being gradually appreciated by the people. Ditto ... ... ... 2 Ditto ... ... May 1898 ... ... Howrah Municipality ... The Secretary to the municipality reports that 330 cows were served by the two hulls, of which one died of rinderpest in October. He says that no improvement in particular has been marked as yet in the local breed of cattle, but that the surviving bull is highly appreciated by the people. Darbhanga ... ... 2 Darbhanga ... ... January 1899 ... North Lakhimpur, Assam .. The Chairman of the Local Board, North Lakhimpur, Assam, reports that 17 cows were served from January to 31st March 1899 by one bull, which has been kept in charge of a tea-garden Manager, but no calf has been born as yet. The second bull has not been a success, as it has covered no cows up to date. Hissar ... ... ... 1 Hissar ... ... ... March 1898 ... ... Hatwa Raj ... ... ... The Manager reports that the bull, being as yet too young to breed from, has not been made any use of. This bull is one of the eight bulls brought down from Hissar. He is a handsome animal. Do. ... ... ... 1 Do. ... ... ... December 1898 ... Bettia Raj ... ... ... The Manager reports that as the bull was only supplied in December 1898, no appreciable results can be reported on. Do. ... ... ... 2 Do. ... ... ... March 1898 ... ... Kunti Indigo Concern ... The Manager reports that one of the Hissar bulls seems to be useless, because he does net go near cows. The other is reported to have served 18 cows during the year under report, with 5 calves as the result. The calves have shown a very great improvement in colour, and their size is twice as much as that of local calves. The Manager paid laltogether Rs. 250 for each of these Hissar bulls. I suggest that the people at Hissar should be careful not to sell impotent bulls, when they must have the means of testing their capabi- lities on the spot. This bull should be changed, or the money refunded. Do. ... ... ... 1 Do. ... ... ... September 1891 ... Bhagalpur Central Jail ... The Superintendent of the jail reports that the big Hissar bull served 13 jail cows during the year with success, and on two occasions met with failure. Three outside cows were also visited, but with what result cannot be ascertained. The bull had suffered for sometime from the inflammation of the penis. Since his recovery he was tried on one cow, but failed. His offsprings are good, and one big male calf of his, aged now four years, pro- mises exceedingly well, and has begun recently to serve cows. Only slight use is made of this bull by the public, as there are several other good bulls in the neighbourhood. The Superintendent is willing to part with the bull, which is about 14 years old, and maintain two other good bulls, which are enough for the needs of the jail. Do. ... ... ... 3 Do. ... ... ... March 1898 ... Dumraon Raj ... ... ... The Manager reports that out of the three Hissar bulls, one is kept in Dumraon, another sent to Gazipur, and the third is reserved for Arrah. No register could possibly be kept showing accurately the number of cows : covered by the bulls, for they go out among the cattle in villages, where they cover cows in large numbers, so the exact number cannot be given. But it is known that each bull has covered nearly 144 cows, three of which have produced very good bull calves, strongly-built and well set-up. The results, from the cows of the distant villages are not known, and some of the cows are pregnant in Dumraon. The leal breed of cattle is slowly im- i proving. The bulls are much appreciated by the public. The people of distant villages, as well as those of Dumraon itself, are using the bulls where they can manhge to secure their services.
