ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1899-1900.
No. 641 OF 1900 From THE SUPERINTENDENT, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency; To THE UNDER SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Camp Ahmednagar, dated 7th June 1900. SIR, I have the honour to submit, for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council, the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department in the Bombay Presidency for the official year 1899-1900. 2. 1 was on furlough until 6th November 1899, on which date I took over charge of the Department from Veterinary Lieutenant Baldrey, who acted as Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, during my absence. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, J. W. A. MORGAN, Veterinary-Major, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency. Through the Survey Commissioner and Director of Land Records and Agriculture, Poona. B 347GOVERNMENT OF BOMBAY. ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1899-1900. PART I.4 existed of importing nothing but 13-2 and 13-3 ponies as the more saleable article to the exclusion of bigger horse will to a great extent be done away with by this measure, and I trust to see a revival of the days when the majority of the animals imported were from 14-1 to 14-2, which is without doubt the average height of the Arab horse. Number removed from re- gisters. 5. Five stallions were removed from the registers during the year for various reasons as detailed in Tables II and III. The T. B. E. stallion "Montezuma," who since his arrival in 1897 has constantly suffered from "colic," died from "enteritis" in December 1899. The pony stallion "Mimic" was suffering from a permanent enlargement of the sheath of the penis, which rendered him useless for stud purposes. He was recommended to be cast and sold (vide Government Resolution No. 2030, dated 18th March 1899, Revenue Department). Subsequently the pony was castrated, in the hope that the operation would cause a reduction of the enlargement of his sheath. But finding that the desired effect was not attained, it was deemed advisable to destroy him, and a report to that effect was made to Government. The animal, however, died from "meningitis" (staggers), before a reply was received from Government. One Arab horse and one Arab pony were destroyed, old and worn out. At the last Ahmednagar Horse Show the judges were of opinion that Norfolk Trotter stallions were unsuitable for the mares in the Deccan, and should be removed from the Bombay Presidency. The proposal was approved of by the Inspector General, Civil Veterinary Department, and the N. T. E "Model" was cast and sold during the year under report. There are only two more Norfolk Trotters in this Presidency and they will be removed as soon as new horses are available to fill up their places. The general percentage of casualties was 7.69 for horse and 12.5 for pony against 3.03 and 23.53 respectively last year. Number present at close of year. 6. The number of horse and pony stallions present at the close of the year was as shown below:[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]

5 9. The attached sketch map of the Bombay Presidency will show the various stands and the number and class of stallions at each of them tin the last day of the year under report. Number of mares covered and demand for stallions. 10. The total number of mares covered by Government horse and pony stallions during the year was 1,162 against 1,466 last year. The average number of mares covered per stallion employed at stud work was 28.81 against 35.42. This result is satisfactory when the famine conditions which have provailed throughout the Presidency are taken into consideration, and the great difficulties which breeders have experienced in bringing their mares to the various stallion stands. Stallions which produce the most suitable stock for army. 11. Table V shows that out of 34 head of stock reared in the Ahmednagar Depôt, 28 were allotted to British Cavalry, 2 to Native Cavalry and 4 rejected. Of those issued to British. Cavalry, 1 was selected as a charger and 2 to Royal Artillery. Of those got by thorough-breds, 73.33 per cent. were issued to British Cavalry, 6.67 per cent. to Native Cavalry and 20.00 per cent. rejected. The get of Norfolk Trotters were all issued to British Cavalry, but the total only amounted to 4. Of those got by Arabs, 77.78 per cent. were issued to British Cavalry, 11.11 per cent. to Native Cavalry and 11.11 per cent. rejected. Of the unknown sires, of which there were only 2, 100 per cent. were issued to British Cavalry. Of the 4 got by Australian sires, 100 per cent. were issued to British Cavalry. Two of the above were got in Australia, foaled and reared in the Ahmednagar paddocks, and 2 were by the thorough- brod Waler "Bassanio" out of country-bred mares. The rejections, of which there were 4, were got by thorough-bred English 3 and Arab 1. They were cast for being under-sized and too light, and averaged Rs. 307 at auction. It is most satisfactory to notice that this batch of horses averaged 15-1 in height and measured 7¼ inches below the knee. The batch of 7 got by Arabs were, without a single exception, very high class, standing over 15-1 in height, com- pact, short-legged horses, with great quality and bone, and perfect for the work required of them. I do not think that it is advisable in any way to go beyond this standard with the Indian country-bred, as horses of this stamp are fully capable of carrying the ordinary trooper and are hardy and will stand great fatigue and exposure; if bred bigger, they are generally high on the leg, inclined to be flat-sided, and have neither the stamina to withstand bad times, nor are they so sound as the smaller and more compact horse. (2).6 13. There is an increase of 90 compared with last year, which is due chiefly to the number bought by the Native Cavalry and the Central Division Police. The Remount Depôt remains more or less stationary. It is very satis- factory to find that the number sanctioned by Government, viz., 150, to be reared at Ahmednagar can be purchased in the districts. It is pleasing to note that there is a considerable improvement in the returns furnished by purchasing officers, and that out of 242 remounts purchased, 120 are the known get of Government sires. There is yet room for further improvement under this head. 14. The various places at which these remounts were purchased are given in the table below:7 cost of maintaining a horse and a pony stallion separately in each district, excluding the transit charges:8 Number removed from re- gisters. 23. The following table will show the number of branded mares removed from registers for various causes as given in Table XII:9 given below and compared with the figures for the last year in each pro- vince:10 III.[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]

11 Veterinary Assistants distinctly state that outbreaks of rinderpest and foot and mouth disease occurred in the two districts, i. e., Kolába and Surat. The Collectors have been asked in future to forward reports in the prescribed form. As there are no Veterinary Assistants in Sholápur and Bijápur it is difficult to ascertain whether these districts were free. The probabilities are that they were not. The report- ed numbers of attacks from various diseases was 5,465 against 4,284 last year. Of this number 1,934 or 35.4 per cent. proved fatal. The attached sketch map of the Bombay Presidency will show the tracts affected by cattle-disease during the year and the degree of severity with which they were affected. (2).12 Simultaneous13 Collector of Purport. Khándesh ... Approves the recommendation, but states that it should stand over till better times. Násik ... It is not feasible to purchase a bull and let it wander as a hull dedicated to a deity, because the rayat would not consider such a dedication as genuine. Ahmednagar ... The experiment was tried in 1881 and after a trial of 5 years it was given up. The proposal cannot be entertained at present owing to want of funds. Poona ... The District Local Board decided to consult the Director of Agriculture as to the nature, number and cost of bulls to be purchased. Sholápur ... Resolved to buy a Khillari bull to be kept at Sholápur City, its services being gratuitously offered. The system to be extended if works well. Sátára ... Some of the Boards are willing to accept the proposal, but the pecuniary difficulty precludes them from adopting it for the present Belgaum ... Stud bulls were maintained from 1887 to 1893 and the cost was out of proportion to the work done by them. The Board is unwilling to pur- Bijápur ... chase any more bulls in view of these facts. The proposal is not approved, giving full reasons. Dhárwár ... The matter will be considered. No decision arrived at. Kánara ... This is not a cattle-breeding district; besides the finances of the Board are Ratnágiri ... poor. The system is not known in the district and the Board is unable to bear any expenditure at present owing to plague charges. Kolába ... The Board is unable to consider the proposal at present owing to want of funds. Thána ... Sympathises in the desire to improve the breed of cattle, but is unable to hold out any hope for some years to come, as all the money the Board Surat ... can spare is dedicated to plague measures. The matter will be considered. Broach ... The year being one of scarcity in which it is hard to find fodder for ani- mals, the Board does not consider it advisable to make any provision for keeping stud bulls. Kaira ... The Board is of opinion that no action should be taken at present. Panch Maháls ... The Board has already purchased a bull and handed it over to a herdsman on certain conditions and that they are unable to purchase another bull. Ahmedabad ... The proposal cannot be adopted by the Board. 49.With the exception of Dhárwár and Surat, who simply state that they will consider the matter, and Sholápur and Poona, who are willing to assist in the scheme, the remaining 14 are either unable or unwilling to assist in any measures being taken with a view of attempting to improve the breed. I need hardly point out that after two or three seasons of scarcity the climax has been reached this year, and that the present is a particularly bad time to bring forward any measures requiring money, as the finances of most of the Local Boards show a large deficit owing to plague and famine. I have gone very carefully into the cattle question of this Presidency, its various breeds, demands, sources of supply, breeding grounds, &c, and have already shown in former reports that when the conditions are favourable, viz., in the Krishna Valley, Northern Gujarát, the Gir hills of Káthiáwár and amongst the large herds of Malvi and Khillari cattle, the breeder is quite alive to the necessity of keeping his breed pure, and the characteristics which distinguish these various breeds could only have been arrived at by maintaining them pure for many generations. 50.Few finer cattle are to be found in India than exist in the districts I have named above, and there is no doubt that breeders in these particular tracts are men who thoroughly understand their business and the greatest care is taken to use only bulls of superior class. The bull calves are castrated when young, and sold as yearlings or two year olds to occupants of land in Kaira, Ahmedabad and Baroda, and on the breeding grounds nothing but a few of the highest class bulls are allowed to graze with the calves and heifers. 51.In the Deccan the conditions are completely reversed, and in no sense of the word can this particular tract be called a cattle-breeding district. The rayat finds that his wants are better supplied by purchasing from the large herds B 34714 of Malvi and Khillari cattle that are bred on the Sátpura range and brought annually to the Deccan for sale, and that any attempt to breed working cattle is done at a loss. 52.To regulate the breeding of cattle in a district of this sort would necessitate the entire change of the present system of village cattle management, and the expenses attending the production of young stock would be considerably increased. Village cattle are herded together, attended by two or three small boys. They are separated by their owners at night, but all run promiscuously together during the day. It is the custom of the district not to castrate young bulls until they are nearly full grown, and these cover the best cows, such as they are, before the owner knows that they are in season. Under these condi- tions an owner can have no possible idea when his particular cow is in season, and if he had, the expenses incurred by taking her to a special bull would not repay him, as the offspring when mature, say at 5 years old, would not be worth Rs. 10 more than the ordinary village cattle. To gain this small advan- tage he must forego all the advantages of cheap herding, he must tend and feed his cattle separately, castrate his young bulls and be certain that his cow has had the services of a superior bull. Will he take this trouble and set aside the custom of generations, or fight against natural conditions which from time im- memorial had proved to him as unsuitable for cattle breeding? More especially when he finds that his wants can be supplied by superior animals at a cheaper rate than he can breed himself. I have not thought it necessary to go into minute details, but have given the broad facts with reference to the totally opposite conditions from a cattle-breeding point of view which exist in this Presidency and which will require careful consideration before formulating any plan for improving the various breeds. It is most essential that the scheme should be one when it is possible to get a continuity of action and when the breeder can be shown that by adopting the method recommended his stock become more valuable in the market. 53.That any plan to be successful must be worked on broad and general lines and the placing of a few selected bulls amongst the millions of cattle in this country can have no appreciable or permanent effect. The establishment of Government farms, where only the very best cattle would be bred, would only be sufficient to meet special requirements, and in no case, without very great expense, is the output likely to meet the demands of a vast country like India. Moreover, owing to the conditions of the country in which these farms many be situated, it will only be possible to breed the particular class of bull suitable to that particular locality. It is a well-known fact that any attempt to move the cattle or sheep of one part of India to another is fatal, and experience condemns any attempt at working on these lines, so that, if any system of Government supply of bulls is contemplated, it will be necessary to establish farms in several parts of India so as to meet the requirements of each district with its own particular breed of cattle. 54.I take it that the main object of the whole scheme is to improve each indigenous breed without attempting any violent outcross or the introduction of blood that would be unsuitable for the district, and in which no possible chance of permanency could be hoped for. 55.That each district possesses its own particular breed of cattle in which a certain percentage of good bulls can be found, there can be no doubt, and it is by the careful selection of the best bulls in each district that a permanent and general improvement throughout the various breeds can be brought about; but before any such improvement can possibly be hoped for, it will be necessary that steps should be taken to enforce the cumpulsory castration of all young bulls not required for stud purposes. There should be no difficulty whatever in adopting this measure throughout India, as the large majority of bull calves are at some period of their lives either castrated or mulled by their owners. The only necessity would be to ensure it being done at a certain age and not delayed, as it is in most districts of India, until the bulls are 2 or 3 years old and have done incalculable harm. 56.By adopting this measure we at once get to the root of the present evil and commence on the sure basis from which all successful stock breeding
15 springs. We also establish a system that could be made general, is applicable to the whole country, and one that would be permanent, requiring no outlay or expenditure on the part of Government to keep it going. Neither would the scheme be repugnant to the owner, nor would it entail any hardship or expense on him. The village machinery necessary to put this scheme into working order already exists, and if approved could be put into force at once. I feel confident, with this proposal in working order, that a very great improvement would soon be apparent throughout India. Mortality amongst cattle. 57.It is difficult to estimate the mortality which has taken place in cer- tain parts of this Presidency. But there can be no doubt that the districts of Ahmedabad, Kaira, Panch Maháls and Broach have lost something like 70 per cent. Surat, being well supplied with fodder both from grass lands and arable fields, has not suffered to the same extent. Before the famine the above 4 dis- tricts had a little over 13 lákhs of head of cattle, and during the 8 months, from August to March, exported about 300,000 maunds of hides. Assuming 6 hides go to an Indian maund, the above figures represent a mortality amounting to 1,800,000 head of cattle. Sind and Native States, from where cattle were brought early in the season into Ahmedabad and the Panch Maháls in the hope of find- ing grazing, are to a great extent responsible for this number. The figures, however, give an approximate indication of the cattle mortality in the British districts of Gujarát. Among the Gujarát districts, Ahmedabad has suffered most. Next comes the Panch Maháls. In Kaira, where fodder crops were raised to a considerable extent, the mortality was not so high as in the first named two dis- tricts. Broach, by timely removal to the Rájpipla forests, has been able to save a considerable percentage of its cattle. Among the Deccan districts, Khándesh appears to be suffering most. In the five months ending January 1900, it ex- ported 20,300 maunds of hides. Prom Násik the exports for the same period amounted to 10,600 maunds, from Ahmednagar to 4,400, from Sholápur to 4,900 and from Poona to 1,100. The mortality in Sátára and the Karnátic districts of Belgaum, Bijápur and Dhárwár is not likely to be very heavy, as those districts are well supplied with fodder. The mortality in the Deccan districts during the months of February, March and April amounted to 33,282 and in the Guja- rát districts for the month of April to 8,144; the total mortality up to the end of April according to these figures amounts to 2,089,226 head. But i do not think that they can be anywhere near the mark, as they are only calculated up to the end of April, leaving the two most trying months (May and June), in which the mortality must have been very high, still to be accounted for. No proper estimate can possibly be found until next August or September, as very large numbers of the cattle which have managed to exist during the hot weather are in their impoverished state bound to succumb from the effects of eating the young green grass. 58.The Native States bordering on the Bombay Presidency have suffered to a very great extent, and Káthiáwár, as far as I was able to judge when touring in that district, must have lost between 60 to 70 per cent., as very early in the season nearly all the carts were worked by hand labour. The Junágadh State is estimated to have had 105,411 head of cattle before the famine commenced, and if the figures are reliable, at the end of April about 70,000 were still alive. If this is correct, the percentage saved is high. 59.The Deccan cultivator, who is a man accustomed to deal with times of scarcity, realized the position very early in the season and concentrated all his efforts in endeavouring to save his working cattle, and, as far as I can gather from personal observation and enquiry, has to a great extent succeeded. The mortality in the Deccan has been chiefly confined to the small useless cattle that are invariably to be found in large numbers in every village in times of prosperity, and who do not assist in working the land. Cattle Camps in Gujarát. 60.In the month of August 1899 the Government of Bombay realized that the famine in Gujarat had assumed such a serious aspect, and that the mortality amongst cattle would be so great, that it was necessary that some steps should be taken with a view of endeavouring to save even a small propor-
16 tion in that district, and the experiment of establishing cattle camps under European supervision was attempted. Large numbers of cattle were also sent by train to districts where grass and water was abundant. As these camps have yet some time to run, it is impossible in this report to state whether they have been successful and whether it would be advisable under similar circum- stances to adopt similar measures. However, I feel sure that, when the final statistics of these experiments are compiled, they will prove of the utmost value in future famine years. It is more with outbreaks of disease that have occurred that I propose dealing. When these camps were established, the fact was re- cognized that the bringing together of so many animals from different parts of the district would most probably end in outbreaks of epidemic diseases, and with a view to prevent such a possibility extreme caution and daily inspection by qualified Veterinary Graduates was immediately organised and the sanitary arrangements made as perfect as possible. 61.Sábarmati Camp No. 117 66. Cattle Preservation Company's Camp No. 618 72. Should the misfortune ever arise again to form similar camps, no efforts should be spared to procure men with sufficient knowledge of famine cattle to be able to tell at a glance whether animals ought to be accepted or rejected, as I feel sure that on this first careful selection the success or other- wise of a famine cattle camp mainly depends. Those camps, where animals were at first carefully selected, have shown a very slight mortality and scarcely above what was to be expected under normal conditions; but those, on the contrary, where all animals were taken regardless of conditions, show a very high mortality, entirely due to the above cause. Cattle sent by rail to forest lands. 73. In the month of October some 3,500 cattle were railed from the Ahmedabad District and sent to the Thána forests and Dharampur. They were sent inland some 30 miles and grazed in the forests and uplands of the Thána District. The mortality was heavy, and I visited the various herds in April. No disease was apparent, and they were dying of starvation, as the grass was perfectly dry and yielded absolutely no nourishment, and the water- supply indifferent. This somewhat doubtful experiment affords another instance of how careful one should be in moving cattle from one part of India to another either for breeding or any other purpose, and how little adapted the cattle of one district are to accommodate themselves to totally altered conditions. The large heavy Gujarát cattle practically hand-fed, living and working in a perfectly level and flat country, suddenly find themselves transported to a mountainous tract, where to gain a livelihood they were compelled to climb steep places. This they were unable to do and suffered in consequence; whereas the small hill cattle indigenous to the country capable of climbing like goats were able to live in the same forests and keep in condition. Before condemning this experiment as one to be avoided in the future, I think that evidence should be forthcoming as to whether it was not possible under slightly altered conditions to have achieved better results. But there can be no doubt that working on general principles the moving of a heavy breed of cattle from the plains to the hills is not sound policy and apt to end in failure. Another instance has been brought to my notice where the results have been the same. The following Veterinary Graduates were employed on famine cattle camps in Gujarat and did excellent service:19 Násik Itinerant. Of these treated. Cases cured ... ... 452 20 Khándesh Itinerant. Of those treated Cases cured ... ... 138 21 Belgaum Itinerant. Of those treated. Cases cured ... ... ... 808 22 Of those treated. Cases cured ... ... ... 522 23 Kaira Itinerant. Of those treated. Oases cured... ... ... ... ... 475 24 conditions prevailed throughout the entire district and a very considerable por- tion of my time was occupied in the various cattle camps. 91.The following studs were visited during the year in Káthiáwár, viz., Vánkáner, Rájkot, Pálitána, Bhávnagar, Gondal, and 8 head of young stock and one mule purchased. Káthiáwár. 92.As the horse-breeding resources of this Province had been allowed to lapse for a lengthened period, I determined in the year 1894 to visit the various studs and make some attempt to revise the then existing ones and to establish others where suitable conditions existed. The Province now contains 9 studs; the Chiefs were asked to sell their young stock to Government, to introduce good Arabs and thorough-bred English sires, to draft all old and unsuitable mares and to attempt mule breeding. This policy of improvement has been maintained and is most noticeable in the Vankáaner paddocks, where the 2 and 3-year-old fillies by the thorough-bred Government horse "Young Chieftain" out of mares with one or two strains of Arab blood are for size, shape, bone and substance difficult to equal. These fillies are intended to replace old, worn out mares, drafts, &c. They are true types of a successful breed, of which the Deccan and Káthiáwár contain very many notable examples: roomy, compact mares, with the best of legs and feet, very sure breeders and excellent mothers. You can depend upon them to throw true to type, generation after generation, and no fear need be entertained that they will ever throw back to a strain that would unfit their offspring to become cavalry remounts, as they are descendants of three strains only, all of which are pure, viz., Káthi, Arab and English thoroughbred. 93.I have gone carefully through the horse-breeding records of this Province for the last 60 years and know no other part of India where prejudice against what is termed foreign blood, viz., Arab and English thoroughbred, exists to the extent that it does in Káthiáwár. The Garásia of the present day much prefers his own undersized, unsound Káthi sire, whose sole recommendation is that his head is small, that the tips of his ears meet when pointed forward and that he has the requisite number of lucky marks, to the best Arab or thorough- bred that you could produce. This state of affairs, in spite of the efforts of Civil officers and officers of this Department for the last 60 years, still exists, and a very large percentage of the owners of mares in this Province would unhesita- tingly utilize the service of a bad Kathi stallion in preference to a good Arab or thoroughbred. Prejudices, so deep rooted, are difficult to break down and it is for this reason that many of the Chiefs who have realized the value of Arabs and thorough-breds and the immense superiority of their stock over the indi- genous Káthi may eventually, through the medium of their studs, overcome the prejudices of the small owner. 94.That a complete change has taken place in this Province, the following facts go far to prove. For the sake of comparison I will take the 6 years com- mencing 1850 and the 6 years commencing 1894. During the former period Government purchased in this Province and Cutch 415 remounts for Light Cavalry at an average of Rs. 385. History does not relate what size these horses were, but I have great doubts whether many of them would be bought at the present day for cavalry remounts, as the standard required for the Army Remount Department far exceeds anything that the Káthi could, as far as I have been able to ascertain, ever have approached. There is no doubt, however, that these 415 horses were bought from Garásias, were pure Káthis and that the private studs in that day did not contribute a single remount. Take the latter period, viz., from 1894. Government have purchased 83 head of young stock and 5 mules. They have without a single exception been bought from private studs, the property of Chiefs, and are the produce of Arabs and thoroughbreds. Not a single pure Káthi has been bought or has a single head of young stock been purchased from a Garásia. 95.These simple facts are difficult to explain, but there can be no doubt that Káthiáwár as a horse-breeding country has completely changed within the last 60 years, and the same causes have affected this country and brought about this change as they have in other parts of India.
25 96. This Department, since 1894, has purchased 4 Arab, 1 thoroughbred and 3 donkey stallions for this Province, and completed an arrangement with the then following studs to maintain a Government stallion free of cost with certain restrictions as to their produce. The working of these three stallions is shown in paragraphs 28 to 30 above:26 failed, and it was necessary that some steps should be taken immediately. Cart- ing water being both expensive and inconvenient, I determined, in spite of the opinion of all local experts, to deepen the well. After blasting through solid rock for some 8 feet I came on soft, blackish, crumbling rock holding a quantity of water which gushed out so fast as to interrupt the work. The well now contains some 12 feet of water and there has been no diminution in the supply since. Another well, some 300 yards away, was treated in the same man- ner with similar results. I have simply quoted these two experiments, as Mr. Santo Crimp considers the Deccan unsuitable for Artesian wells. Neither of these wells can be called Artesian in any sense of the word, except the fact that they are of great depth (57 feet), that the various strata gone through have yielded no water until the solid rock was reached, underneath which a large quantity of clean sweet water was obtained. Nagar is more or less surrounded by hills, and although not an expert in the matter I see no particular reason why the valley should not have the necessary basin-like formation which is so essential for an Artesian well. 103. When taking into consideration the large number of Government horses, troops, &c., at this place, I think, under the circumstances, if a boring apparatus is available, that it would be both advisable and interesting to further test this well as to whether Artesian conditions exist or not in this particular part of the Deccan. The experiment would not be costly and if successful would be most beneficial. General Remarks. 104. The progress of the Department has been much hampered during the past year, as famine conditions prevailed throughout the entire Presidency, and Local Boards and District Bodies have been unable from want of funds to assist in furthering suggested improvements, and any attempt to establish new veterinary dispensaries has had to be abandoned until better times. Horse- breeding has suffered to a great extent and the growth of the young stock of the present season is likely to be permanently affected by the long period of scarcity through which they have passed. I do not think that any of the best mares have been lost, although much reduced in condition, and several have not been covered. Former experience has shown that the Deccan possesses great recuperative powers, and I trust that, given two or three good seasons, matters will soon right themselves. District. Name of return.

REVIEW BY THE SURVEY COMMISSIONER AND DIRECTOR, LAND RECORDS AND AGRICULTURE, BOMBAY. NO. A/2824 OF 1900. Poona, 30th July 1900. Submitted to Government. The Superintendent's tour. Ahmedabad, Kaira, Surat, Khándesh, Násik, Ahmed- nagar, Poona, Sholápur, Sátára, Belgaum, Dhárwár, Thána, Pálanpur, Vankáner, Rájkot, Bhávnagar, Gondal, Songad, Pálitána and Gondal. 2. The office of Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay, was held by Veterinary Lieutenant Baldrey till 6th November 1899, when Veterinary Major Morgan, the permanent incumbent, returned from furlough. The distance travelled by the Superintendent beats the records of many years past, being 1,352 miles by road, 13,701 miles by rail, total 15,053 miles. The Superintendent visited the marginally noted districts and States and also paid thirteen visits to Bombay, mostly in connection with experimental inoculation against rinderpest. Horse and pony stallions on the register. 3. There were 45 stallions on the register at the commencement of the year. Of these 5 were removed from the register, 2 being destroyed, 2 having died and 1 being sold. Six stallions (2 thorough-bred English and 4 Arab) were added during the year. Thus the number of stallions at the close of the year was 46, of which 10 were thorough-bred English, 2 Norfolk Trotter, 1 Austra- lian, 32 Arab and 1 country-bred. Ten of the stallions were located in Gujarát and the rest in the Deccan. Stallions actually at stud work. 4. Though the number of stallions at the close of the year was thus one more than in the preceding year, the effective strength or the actual number at stud work showed a slight fall, being 40.33 against 41.39. Mares covered. 5. The following statement shows a considerable fall in the number of mares covered as compared with the preceding year, owing to the famine, which prevented breeders from bringing their mares. But it is satisfactory to find that the figures, excepting those for Gujarát, compare favourably with those of 1897-98, when similar con- ditions prevailed in the Deccan :2 Province. Year.

The number of results unknown is still large, and it is hoped that the forms for the registration of mares and their produce, which have recently been introduced, will bring out better results in future. Relative merits of stallions as foal-getters. 7. As regards the relative merits of the different classes of stallions as foal-getters, the subjoined statement comparing the average percentages of known produce to mares covered for each of the classes shows that the Arab classes of stallions maintain their precedence oyer the thorough-bred English. The results attained by the Australian may be left out of consideration for the present, as they relate only to one mare covered by the single stallion lately imported. Similarly no notice need be taken of the country-bred stallions, horse and pony, as the results recorded pertain only to one stallion in each class. Besides it is doubtful whether the so-called country-bred sires are of pure indigenous breed; and Veterinary Major Morgan, in paragraphs 93 and 94 of his report, does not recommend breeding from sires of even the pure Káthi breed, which he says are too undersized to produce remounts of the standard required by the Army Remount Department. The Norfolk Trotter classes of stallions have, as stated last year, been pronounced unsuitable for the mares obtainable in this Presidency, and one of the three stallions has been sold. Year.

The 4 animals rejected were sold by public auction at an average price of Rs. 307 each. The following statement comparing the per- centages of allotments shows that, as regards supplying British Cavalry remounts, the Australian holds the first rank, the Norfolk Trotter the second, the thorough- bred English the third and the Arab the fourth :3 Year.

The number of country-bred remounts purchased was 242 against 152 during the preceding year, the increase being chiefly due to the larger number of purchases made by the Bombay Native Cavalry. Only 50 of these, however, were pur- chased in the Presidency proper, the rest being bought in Sind, Baluchistán and the Punjáb. The following statement shows the breed of the several country- bred remounts purchased :4 Stallion. Average cost of each stallion excluding transit charges.

But it is doubtful whether the compulsory castration of all but selected bulls, as advocated by those officers, is practicable. There is a general belief among Deccan cultivators that animals, when castrated very young, do not attain the muscle development necessary for draught cattle. At present, persuasion only can be tried, and little can be done in this respect until the Subordinate Civil Veterinary Staff is organized. Shows. 16. No shows were held during the year under report owing to the prevailing scarcity. Cattle-diseases. 17. The following statement shows the extent of epidemic cattle-diseases in the Presidency proper and in Sind as compared with the preceding year : 6 already shown in their Resolution No. 2479, dated 6th June 1900, Famine Department, that this view is based on incorrect information or misapprehension, cut grass being available for all of them. Outside the cattle camps and the Thána forests, the mortality among cattle in Gujarát and the Decean and in the Kohistán hills and the desert of Thar and Párkar was appalling, but owing to various circumstances it is impossible to make even an approximate estimate of its extent. Veterinary Dispensaries. 18. The Ahmedabad District local Board employed an additional Veterinary graduate for itinerating duties in the district. The Superintendent states that this graduate being wholly engaged in supervising one of the cattle camps could not do any regular dispensary work. Leaving out of account this graduate, the number of Veterinary Assistants working in the Presidency proper and in Sind was the same as during the preceding year, including the two Veterinary officers employed by the District Local Boards of Kolába and Ratnágiri at their own cost. The following statement shows a slight fall in the number of cases treated as well as in the percentage of cures as compared with the preceding year:NO. 169 L. OF 1900. From THE PRINCIPAL, Bombay Veterinary College; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department. Bombay Veterinary College, April 16th, 1900. SIR, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report of the working of the Glanders and Farcy Department in Bombay, including animal diseases in general, for the official year 1899-1900. 2. No horses were destroyed for glanders during the year under report. 3. Four suspicious cases were admitted to the Lazaretto, one for farcy and three for glanders, all of which, however, proved refractory to the mallein test 2 that they had to be destroyed. Of the Arabs out of 2,169 that embarked only 14 casualties took place or 0.64 per cent., but it must be borne in mind that the jour- ney the Arabs undertake from the Persian Gulf is much shorter and attended with less risks than the Australians have to undergo. The following Government horse and donkey stallions were landed and received by this Department for despatch to the depôts3 11. In accordance with instructions from Government conveyed in their telegram dated 10th. November 1899, I proceeded to the cattle famine camps at Ahmedabad to enquire into the cause of the mortality amongst the cattle there. I found, from my past experience of Indian famines, what was to be expected, that the majority of the deaths were due to starvation, a fact which was fully borne out by the 42 post-mortem examinations I made, all of which revealed a general atrophy of the tissues of the body and particularly of the heart, the weight of which, in many instances, was only one-third and even as low as one- fourth of the normal weight. That failure of the heart's action was responsible for many deaths was amply illustrated. Cattle would die suddenly when being- sent to the river to water, or be found dead in the enclosures in the morning, without having shown any previous appreciable signs of illness. Fardel-bound, impaction of the third stomach, was extremely common and is always to be found in cattle dying from starvation, because of the want of succulent food and sufficient water ; in fact, cattle in years of scarcity simply browse on what may be called woody fibre; this too hastens to terminate life. There is one point of interest which I consider worthy of record. Out of the 42 post-mortem examinations made by me, I only found signs of tuberculosis in one animal, the seat of the disease being the lungs This goes far to prove that the cattle of the districts are bred from extremely healthy stock. The absence of tuberculosis too can be largely accounted for by the fact that such cattle practically live always in the open, conditions inimical to the propagation of such a scourge. On my arrival at the cattle famine camps, it was reported to me that rinderpest had existed there, but during my stay I saw no cases of the disease. 12. Surra was not so prevalent in Bombay during this year as in the previous year, owing no doubt to the want of rain. The admissions fell below 33 per cent. No cases were reported from Bándra, a suburb where the disease in nor- mal years is always present during the monsoon and after it. On looking over the records relative to surra for the past two years there is one point of interest, viz., that no cases have occurred in the months of January, February, March, April and May, and none in June until after the monsoon had burst, i.e., all the cases took place in the latter half of the year. 13. During the calendar year 1899, rabies increased to an alarming exteut. 32 cases were dealt with as against 14 in 1898 This to my mind is a very serious matter, because of the fact that the number of cases of rabies brought to the College must necessarily be limited owing to the distance of the institu- tion from the City, and the large increase here indicated must as a natural consequence be equally so elsewhere. That several human beings fall victims to this horrible malady annually there can be no doubt. One very sad case came under my notice here where a native gentleman brought his dog suffering from rabies which had bitten him on the 10th August and he died from hydrophobia on the 6th October. Three pigs of the Royal Alfred Sailors' Home in Bombay were bitten by a rabid dog and all succumbed. To prove the correctness of my diagnosis in this instance and to confirm opinions given by me in certain other cases, especially in one where an. English officer had been bitten by a rabid dog, I conducted a series of experi- ments at the Government Lazaretto which fully bore me out4 evening of the sixth, it again began to rise until it reached 106º.6 on the evening of the seventh day, when death took place.5 APPENDIX No, I.

Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department in the Bombay Presidency and the Annual Report on the working of the Glanders and Farcy Act in Bombay for the year 1899-1900. No. 6734. REVENUE DEPARTDMENT. Bombay Castle, 26th October 1900. Letter* from the Principal, Bombay Veterinary College, No. 169-L., dated 16th April 1900 2 7. Veterinary Major Morgan has submitted separately a scheme for the improvement and maintenance of the country breeds of cattle. His summary of the results of the cattle camps in Gujarát and of his experiments with wells in Ahmednagar will be communicated to the Famine Department. 8. It is satisfactory to note that the work of the Veterinary Graduates has reached a very generally high standard, and that their usefulness in the repression of outbreaks of disease is increasing ; but the Collectors and Committees of the Veterinary dispensaries in Násik and Kaira will be requested to note the Superintendent's remarks regarding the graduates in those districts. Government concur in the commendations awarded by the Superintendent, and especially in those bestowed on Messrs. Hyam and Bhatt for their work in Ahmedabad. 9. Government would have been glad to have had fuller remarks regarding cattle disease in the Province of Sind, and the reason why 92 per cent of the cases reported were vaguely ascribed to " other diseases." It is very unlikely moreover that the Shikárpur, Upper Sind Frontier and Thar and Párkar Districts should have remained free from disease, and it is clear that more attention must be given to this important subject. No mention is made by the Superintendent of the cattle mortality in Thar and Párkar. Government are satisfied with the work done by the graduates, especially Mr. Háji, whose duties have been very heavy. The attention of the Collector will be drawn to the high fees levied at Hyderabad. 10. It is satisfactory to note that no animals had to be destroyed in Bombay on account of glanders. Veterinary Major Mills' remarks regarding the improvement in the method of importation of horses and of the readiness of importers to adopt his suggestions have been noted with satisfaction. The attention of the Municipal Commissioner will be invited to Veterinary Major Mills' remarks regarding the undesirability of gully traps in stables. 11. The Governor in Council desires to acknowledge the excellent work done by Veterinary Major Morgan in a trying year, and the successful adminis- tration by him and Veterinary Major Mills of the Departments under their charge.

GOVERNMENT OF BOMBAY. ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT FOR THE OFFICAL YEAR 1900-1901. PART I.4 (2).5 (b).6 This gives a total of 179 against 183 of last year. This number is satisfac- tory considering the conditions of the country and the large number of villages visited where no mares whatever were collected for branding. 15. The following table will show the number of branded mares removed from the registers for various reasons :7 18. The percentage of produce and not held shows improvement. The rise in unknown cases is due to the fact that the place of the Itinerant Veterinary Graduate in Khándesh was vacant at the close of the year and no returns were received from that district. The following table shows the working of the prin- cipal classes of stallions for the last two years :8 PART II.9 districts and 177 cattle successfully inoculated and the system thoroughly explained to all concerned. A certain amount of opposition was shown to the simultaneous method, but none where serum alone was used. The above is a very fair start when the facts are taken into consideration, viz., that the system is new both to village officers and cattle owners and that only a few sporadic cases were reported. Veterinary Graduate Basu investigated an outbreak of Surra in the Bassein Táluka and was of considerable help to me in experimenting in certain villages in the Nagar District with a view of inducing the villagers to get their bull calves castrated at an early date. The work done by him has been most satis- factory. IV.10 remainder small animals. With the exception of a slight outbreak of foot-and- mouth disease, no epidemic was reported in the district. The Veterinary Gra- duate paid 23 visits to owners' houses and inspected the Government stallion at Chálisgaon. The work done is satisfactory. Poona. 32.

Out of the above number 717 were horses, 1,328 cattle, 216 buffaloes and the remainder small animals. The Veterinary Graduate during the year regularly attended the weekly cattle markets, Gov- ernment stallions and Pinjarápol, and paid 148 visits to owners' horses. The steady increase in the number of cases and rapidly growing popularity of the dispensary speak volumes for the graduate in charge. His work is consistently good and the report submitted is most satisfactory. Nadiád. 39. Veterinary Graduate P. D. Maniar.12 Fodder Arrangements. 44. The land within the stable enclosure was sown with jowári, but, owing to insufficient rain, withered, and the entire crop was lost. The grass yield from the Padampur Kuran was also very poor. A small patch of lucern that can be irrigated has been most successful. The following table shows that the land was worked at a loss of Rs. 133-14-8 and must be attributed to insufficient rainfall:13 TABLE I. GOVERNMENT OF BOMBAY.

REVIEW BY THE DIRECTOR, LAND RECORDS AND AGRICULTURE, BOMBAY. No. A/3320 OF 1901. Poona, 3rd August 1901. Submitted to Government. Curtailment of the Re- ports. 2. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay, has tried to curtail his report in accordance with the orders of Government. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Baluchistan and Sind, has given as before a detailed account of the working of each dispensary, which ought to have been curtailed, and states in explanation that he did not receive copies of Government Resolutions on the subject. Some necessary changes in the numbering of the tables and the omission of blank tables (including Table P about tour made) have been made by this office. Superintendent's tour. 3. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay, travelled 843 miles by road and 10,671 miles by rail for the performance of his various duties. Stallions and their actual strength. 4. There were 46 stallions at the commencement and 47 at the close of the year. The effective strength during the year was 39.67 against 40.33 during the preceding year. Mares covered. 5. The number of mares covered was 943 against 1,162, giving an average per stallion of 23.77 mares as compared with 28.81. The falling off is attributed to the effects of famine. Owing to the heavy mortality among mares in Gujarát, the Superintendent has deemed it advisable to temporarily close three of the stands (Deesa, Prántij and Kaira). Produce statistics. 6. Out of the 1,162 mares covered during the preceding year, 405 foaled, 540 did not hold and the result of the rest is not known. In spite of the appreciable rise from 12.75 to 18.68 in the percentage of unknown results, the percentage of produce has risen from 31.45 to 34.85, the percentage of " not held " cases going down from 55.80 to 46.47. The increase in the percentage of produce is confined to the Deccan, Gujarát showing a fall from 29.26 to 21.88 per cent., apparently due to the greater dearth of fodder. Relative merits of stallions as foal-getters. 7. The Arab classes of stallions maintained their precedence over the thorough-bred English as regards the relative merits as foal-getters, the percentage of produce being for Arab horses 35.23, for Arab ponies 37.95 and for thorough-bred English 26.25. No notice need be taken of the other classes of stallions, as they are each represented by a single stallion. Country-bred remounts purchased. 8, Though the number of country-bred remounts purchased was 135, the number purchased within the Presidency proper was only 31, the rest of the purchases being made in Sind, Baluchistan and Punjáb. It is again satisfactory to find that as many as 50 per cent. of the total purchases were the known produce of Government stallions. Castration. 9. Thirty-five colts were castrated in the Pre- sidency proper and 38 in Sind, making a total of 73 as compared with 60 during the preceding year. Mares branded. 10. The number of mares branded was about the same as during the pre- ceding year, being 179 against 183. Of these only 9 were branded in Gujarát and the rest in the Deccan. The depletion of horse-stock in Gujarát accounts for the small number of mares branded in that Province. B 543
2 Maintenance charges. 11. The average cost of maintenance of each horse stallion was Rs. 516 and pony stallion Rs. 470. Both these costs were higher than those incurred during the preceding two years owing to the high prices that prevailed, but they were lower than those of 1897-98. The Superintendent has not explained why the cost of feed of pony stallions was greater than that of horse stallions in Sátára, Kaira and Ahmedabad. Owing to insufficient rainfall, the Padampur Kuran and the land within the stable enclosure at Ahmednagar were together worked at an estimated loss of Rs. 134. Total cost of the Depart- ment. 12. The total cost of the Department amounted to Rs. 55,646, showing an increase of Rs. 10,243. To the items of increased expenditure mentioned by the Superintendent in para- graph 22 of his report, the cost of the Ahmednagar show, which was not held during the preceding year, should be added. Horse and mule-breeding under Local Boards and in Native States. 13. The Arab stallion maintained by the Hyderabad District Local Board covered 23 mares. Out of the 34 mares covered during the preceding year, only 6 foaled, and the result of as many as 22 coverings is reported as unknown. This is hardly satisfactory, and the authorities con- cerned should take steps to ascertain the results as far as possible in future. The cost of maintaining this stallion was Rs. 387. The donkey stallion kept by Khán Bahádur G. R. Jatoi covered 24 mares. The cost of keeping this stallion is stated to have been only Rs. 53, which does not seem correct, the preceding year's cost amounting to Rs. 264. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay, states that the stands at Vánkáner, Rájkot, Bhávnager, Porbandar and Junágadh, which he visited, were in a very satisfactory state. Nine head of young stock and 5 mules were purchased. The Pálanpur State has applied for the loan of an Arab stallion and the Rájkot and Rewa Kántha States are desirous of establishing paddocks for the fostering of mule-breeding. Cattle-breeding. 14. Veterinary-Major Morgan's views with regard to the improvement of cattle-breeding have already been noticed last year. He advocates early castration of bulls as the chief means of improving the breeds of Indian cattle, and attempted to put his views into practice in the neighbourhood of Ahmednagar. He castrated a certain number of bulls without meeting with any opposition, but thinks that no mate- rial progress can be effected without adequate agency. Horse-shows. 15. The Ahmednagar horse-show held in November was pronounced a success. The exhibits numbered 432, and 9 animals were purchased by Government. Cattle diseases. 16. No cattle disease was reported from Broach, Surat, Khándesh, Ahmed- nagar, Sholápur, Bijápur, Thar and Párkar and Upper Sind Frontier. In the Presidency proper, 3,136 animals were attacked against 5,466 during the preceding year. Rinderpest claimed 68.9 per cent. of the attacks, foot-and- mouth disease 22.1 per cent., anthrax, pleuro-pneumonia and charbon-sympto- matique together 3.4 per cent. and other diseases 5.6 per cent. Násik suffered most. 54.30 per cent. of the total number of attacks proved fatal. The figures for Sind seem unreliable. The exact coincidence between the figures given in Tables L and M for Karáchi and Hyderabad leads to the suspi- cion that the figures from Table L, showing cases treated in the dispensaries, have been bodily repeated in Table M, which is to show only cases of epidemic cattle diseases. The remarks made by the Superintendent in his notice of the working of the dispensaries that these districts remained free from contagious diseases during the year cannot be reconciled with the entry of a large number of cases in Table M.
3 No great progress has been made with the experiments with inoculation against rinderpest undertaken by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, Bombay, partly owing to the delay in the receipt of reports of outbreaks and partly to the sporadic nature of the outbreaks. Twenty-seven villages were visited and 177 cattle successfully inoculated. Veterinary Dispensaries. 17. In the Presidency proper 20,497 animals or 1,715 more than during the preceding year were treated in the various Vete- rinary Dispensaries, and the number of cases cured and relieved together formed 88.5 per cent., showing an improvement of 5.82 per cent. The number of animals treated in Sind was 5,053 or 214 more than during the previous year, and the number of cured and relieved was the same as during that year, viz., 95.5 per cent. The work of the various Veterinary Assistants has been commended, espe- cially that of Messrs. Bhatt and Modak in the Presidency proper and Messrs. Haji and Asudamal in Sind. The remark made by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay, that anthrax regularly appears in certain tálukas of the Belgaum District, and that it would be advisable if strict measures were taken for the disposal of the carcasses should be brought to the notice of the Collector. The attention of the Itinerating Veterinary Assistant, Kaira (Mr. Patel), should be again called to the remark made by the Superintendent, that his report, like his last, contains much useless and irrelevant matter. Veterinary-Major Morgan states that no report was received from the Itinerating Veterinary Assistant, Khándesh, as the dispensary was temporarily closed during the year. The Itinerating Assistant, Mr. Kulkarni, took charge of the Dhulia Veterinary Dispensary on the 1st July 1900, on the removal of Mr. Somney and ought to have submitted a separate report on the Itinerating Dis- pensary for the period it was worked. The unsatisfactory financial condition of the Khándesh Veterinary Dispen- saries noticed last year is due to the District Local Board not having drawn the Government contribution towards the pay of the Veterinary Assistants for a number of years. The subject is under consideration. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Baluchistan and Sind, states that the annual report from the Shikárpur Veterinary Assistant was not received although it was both written and telegraphed for. The Collector should call for the explanation of the Veterinary Assistant, who it seems has only supplied bare figures for the use of the Superintendent. Table N of the Sind report has not been properly filled in. No entries have been made against Nausháhro, and only 29 cases are shown against Shikár- pur; while Table L, and the body of the report, show that as many as 347 cases were treated at the former dispensary and 964 at the latter. The figures in both the tables should tally, and it is hoped greater attention will be paid in filling in the tables in future. Miscellaneous. 18. It is satisfactory to note that all the district returns were punctually received by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay. Conclusion. 19. The work done by both the Superintendents was satisfactory. FRED. YOUNG, Acting Director, Land Records and Agriculture.
No. 144-L. OF 1901. From THE PRINCIPAL, Bombay Veterinary College; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department. Bombay Veterinary College, May 20th, 1901. SIR, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report of the Glanders and Farcy Department in Bombay for the official year 1900-1901. 2.Twenty horses were admitted to the Government Lazaretto as against 4 and 7 in 1899-1900 and 1898-99, respectively. Of this number, 17 were from the City and 3 from the Harbour. Three were confirmed farcy cases, 11 were suspicious and 6 were contacts. Three horses, therefore, suffering from farcy were destroyed as against none in 1899-1900 and 5 in 1898-99. Out of the 11 suspicious cases 3 died, but the post-mortem ex- amination proved them free from disease, and 8 were discharged, having proved refractory to the Mallein test. Out of the 6 contacts 1 died and 5 were discharged. Of the 20 cases admitted to the Lazaretto during the year, 4 belonged to private individuals, 7 to Arab dealers, 6 to owners of carriages plying for hire and 3 were ownerless. Out of the 3 horses destroyed for farcy, 2 belonged to owners of carriages plying for hire and 1 was ownerless. 3.There were 3 ownerless horses sent in by the Police as against 2 and 1 in 1899-1900 and 1898-99 respectively. All were found straying in the Dádur suburbs. One was a very terrible case of slow starvation and died on the fourth day of admission. 4.During the year 4,825 horses, donkeys and mules were imported2 S.S. "Domenico Balduino"3 APPENDIX I.

This clearly shows the effects of the famine of the two previous years. The percentage of " produce " is less and of " not held " greater, and the actual number of mares covered in those years is less. This is further exemplified in the following table which shows the working of the principal classes of stallions for the last two years :8 The country-bred would be more correctly described as " unknown," and the Norfolk Trotter winners had strains of Arab or English blood on the dam's side. VI.9 having been taken greater care of. To unusual dryness must also be attributed the decrease in outbreaks of disease, especially of a contagious nature. In some localities, though forage has been plentiful, cattle have died for want of water. The causal organisms of Rinderpest and Foot and Mouth Disease are soon ren- dered inert by desiccation, and the people have proved by experience that the best means they can adopt to check an outbreak of these diseases is to picket the affected herd on the dry sandy bed of a river. The number of cases reported must be very much below the number which really occurred. Relatively, how- ever, it is perhaps much the same. Rinderpest is often reported incorrectly for some other disease. (3)10 Dhulia. 28. Veterinary Graduate D. G. Kulkarni.11 February, and from the 16th March has held charge of the Belgaum Veterinary Dispensary, so that he only worked in the district for a period of a little less than ten months. The total number of animals treated was 900 as against 1,028 last year, the decrease being explained above; of these 68 were horses, 550 cattle, 221 buffaloes, and the remainder small animals. The only epizootic which occurred was foot and mouth disease, of which 147 cases were treated. The Veterinary Graduate paid 85 visits to owners' houses, and attended all the weekly cattle markets within reach of his camp. His work is very satisfactory. Dhárwár. 34. Veterinary Graduate R. N. Sane.12 remainder small animals. The decrease may be attributed to continued famine and prevalence of plague. The Veterinary Graduate paid 82 visits to owners' houses in Nadiád and 37 to owners in neighbouring villages, 10 to the Govern- ment Sire at Kaira and 6 to the charity bullocks under charge of the Mámlat- dárs of A'nand and Mehmadabad. He also attended a course of instruction in rinderpest inoculations at Muktesar, leaving the dispensary in charge of the Itinerating Veterinary Graduate V. D. Patel. He afterwards proceeded to the village of Chaklási to investigate an outbreak of rinderpest, inoculating with success 12 animals, thus making a beginning in this line of treatment. Two cases of suspected poisoning, sent for opinion by the Police, were proved by chemical analysis to have been poisoned by arsenic. The report is satisfactory. Kaira Itinerant. 39.

7 TABLE XIX.8 TABLE XXI.REVIEW BY THE DIRECTOR, LAND RECORDS AND AGRICULTURE, BOMBAY. No. A/4090 OF 1902. Poona, 29th August 1902. Submitted. 2. The progress of the Department in horse and mule-breeding in the last two years is contrasted in the following table:2 From other districts in the Presidency proper, including the Bombay City, only 739 cases in all were reported against 3,136 during the preceding year, while the mortality amounted to some 25 per cent. against 54 per cent. The Superintend- ent ascribes the decrease in the number of attacks to the decrease in the num- ber of animals, to greater care being taken of the animals, to unusual dryness and to greater knowledge of the efficacy of preventive measures. 13. All the Veterinary Assistants received instruction from the Imperial Bacteriologist at Muktesar in inoculation against rinderpest in the course of the year, but owing to the short period that elapsed after their instruction and to the absence of the disease, very few inoculations were possible. The importance of their performing this duty with zeal and discretion has been impressed upon them. 14. In the Presidency proper 21,846 animals were treated and in Sind 5,709 against 20,497 and 5,053 respectively during the preceding year. The number cured and relieved formed 87.7 per cent. in the Presidency proper and 94.8 per cent. in Sind. The small number of cattle treated at the Poona dispensary is remarkable. It is hoped that the opening of a branch dispensary in the City of Poona may effect an improvement. Suitable dispensary buildings are especially required in Dhárwár and Belgaum. The attention of the District Local Boards may be invited to the desirability of their establishing dispen- saries where in-patients can be properly treated in situations convenient to agriculturists. 15. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay, has com- mended the work done by all the Veterinary Assistants, especially that of Messrs. Bhatt, Modak and Mamtora. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Beluchistan and Sind, has made no remarks regarding the work done by the several Veterinary Assistants in Sind. In Provincial tables XIX and XXI information should have been given by the Superintendent separately for each dispensary and not for the Province of Sind as a whole. H. S. LAWRENCE, Acting Director, Land Records and Agriculture.
No. 149-L. OF 1902. From THE PRINCIPAL, Bombay Veterinary College; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department. Bombay Veterinary College, 25th April 1902. SIR, I have the honour to submit the annual report of the Glanders and Farcy Department in Bombay for the official year 1901-1902. 2. During the year under report 20 horses were admitted to the Lazaretto, as against 20 and 4 horses in 1900-1901 and 1899-1900, respectively. All these horses came from the City. Out of this number, 3 were con- firmed glandered cases, 15 were suspicious, and 2 were contacts. Of the 15 suspicious cases, 3 reacted to the mallein test and were destroyed, thus bring- ing up the total number of glandered cases for the year to 6 as against 3 in 1900-1901 and none in 1899-1900. Ten were discharged as they did not react to mallein test, 1 died, but the post-mortem examination revealed no signs of glanders, and 1 remained under observation. Of the 2 contacts, 1 died from pneumonia and 1 was discharged. Out of the total admissions, 4 belonged to private individuals, 2 to an Arab horse dealer, 13 to owners of carriages plying for hire and 1 was ownerless. Of the horses admitted 4 were walers, 1 country-bred and 15 arabs. 3. During this year 5,055 horses, donkeys and mules were imported into Bombay, vide Appendix No. 1, as against 4,825 and 4,112 in 1900-1901 and 1899-1900, respectively. The Australian imports were 1,396 horses, 298 ponies as against 1,738 horses and 119 ponies and 1,545 horses and 132 ponies in 1900-1901 and 1899-1900, respectively. The Arab imports stand at 1,802 horses and 927 ponies as against 1,561 horses and 862 ponies and 1,333 horses and 822 ponies in 1900-1901 and 1899-1900 respectively. The Persian imports were 206 horses and 11 ponies as against 144 horses and 10 ponies and 146 horses in 1900-1901 and 1899-1900, respectively. The Austro-Hungarian imports were 31 horses and 4 ponies as against 98 horses and 1 pony and 13 horses in 1900-1901 and 1899-1900, respectively. 267 mules were imported. Eleven came from Australia and 256 from the Persian Gulf. Out of the Australian imports, the percentage of casualties en route from various causes was 2.405. The casualties amongst the Arabs stood at 401 per cent. 4. During the year under report, the following horse and donkey stallions were landed and received by this Department for despatch to the Babugarh Depôt:2 S.S. "Mikado"3 APPENDIX I.

GOVERNMENT OF BOMBAY. ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1902-1903. PART I.4 The various places at which these remounts were purchased are given below:5 This shows a decrease of Rs. 63, due to the reduction in prices of almost all articles of food owing to an abundant rainfall last year.

The effects of a famine, such as has been experi- enced in the breeding districts of the Presidency for some years past, do not fully show themselves until the famine has passed away, and they continue for some time afterwards. Several years must elapse before the numbers of pre- famine time can again be bred up to. The total number present was 347 as compared to 383 last year. 19. Table XIV shows the Government stallions whose produce won prizes at the Ahmednagar horse show. The following is their order and percentage of winners:9 My opinion is that both surmises are true. The late famine caused great re- ductions generally in the number of outbreaks of disease by the dryness which resulted, and by the reduction of the number of animals and increased care taken of the remainder. It must not be forgotten that the Punjab, the North- West Provinces and Bengal are subject to constant re-infection from China, and it is to be expected that the average number of outbreaks of rinderpest would be greater in those Provinces than in Bombay. The virus of rinderpest would in the majority of cases be destroyed by desiccation before it could be conveyed so far as this Presidency by road from the northern Presidencies. For the past year I have made very careful personal inquiries of officials, ryots, and others as to the prevalence of rinderpest, but have neither heard of the existence of the disease excepting the reports of the four outbreaks noted above, nor have I seen it. An outbreak of cattle disease reported in the Thána District as rinder- pest and attended by my special assistant proved to be "some disease which he could not diagnose," but he afterwards concluded it was a disease known in Italy under the name of "Barbone" (Septicæmia Hamorrhagica). I may say that he had never seen the disease before. Of the four outbreaks of rinderpest reported during the past year only three are worthy of note: one outbreak, each in the Thána, Ratnágiri and Dhár- wár Districts, resulting in 32, 40 and 48 deaths respectively. These outbreaks had ended before the reports of them had reached my office, and it might well be asked in view of the absence of rinderpest in other parts whether these really were that disease. Privately it has come to my knowledge that in some parts there has been considerable loss amongst sheep and goats from the consumption of ergotised bajari. Anthrax.10 5, 30 and 53 cattle. No deaths occurred after the inoculations. It appears the people had seen cattle inoculated in the previous year and asked for it again, because they thought it had caused an improvement in the condition of their animals. An outbreak of bubonic plague among cattle was reported from the Ratnágiri District. This was either quarter ill or Barbone. The Presidency would appear to have been extraordinarily free from rinder- pest, and I cannot help thinking that so far as Bombay is concerned its prevalence has been exaggerated owing to other diseases having been mistaken for it by the uninitiated. IV.11 epizootic which occurred was "foot and mouth disease." Medicine was issued for the treament of 449 cases in 47 neighbouring villages. The Veterinary Graduate paid 43 visits to the stables of various owners. One colt only was castrated. The dispensary is growing steadily in popularity and Mr. Reuben is doing good work. No rinderpest occurred. Násik Itinerant. 27. Veterinary Graduate H. R. Kshirsagar.12 off in numbers is attributed to the introduction of certain rules and fees for the treatment of animals, but more particularly to the rules. Enquiry is being made as to whether these require any modification. Of the total number of cases treated 235 were horses, 544 cattle, 156 buffaloes, 564 dogs, and the remainder, with a few exceptions, goats and sheep. Seven horses were castrated. The Veterinary Graduate visited the Chinchli Cattle Fair, attended the Police horses and the Municipal cattle, and occasionally inspected the cattle market. There is some want of accommodation for in-patients in the dispensary, but this will be attended to when funds permit. The work of the Veterinary Graduate has been satisfactory, No epizootic occurred. Belgaum Itinerant and Chikodi stationary dispen- saries. 33. In charge of Veterinary Graduate D. B. Mamtora.13 cases had ceased on his arrival owing to reports being late. During the past year he has not moved out without receiving early and reliable information. This matter has been brought to the notice of the proper authorities by the Veterinary Graduate. Of the total number of cases treated 19 were horses, 274 bullocks, 154 cows, 247 buffaloes, 57 calves, 8 sheep and goats, 61 dogs and 5 others. The Veterinary Graduate paid 250 visits to owners' stables. Anthrax and foot and mouth disease have appeared in a mild form only. No rinderpest has occurred, but in view of the fact that some years ago a great outbreak of this disease took place (when the late Principal Steel was deputed to investigate it) the Veterinary Graduate should be sent to Muktesar for a course of instruction in anti-rinderpest inoculations as all other Veterinary Graduates have been. Veterinary Graduate Mudliar's work has been very satisfactory. He not only takes great interest in his dispensary, but exercises a friendly supervision over the private byres and stables of the town generally and inspects as far as possible all animals entering and leaving the town. Thána. 37. The employment of a Veterinary Graduate in the Thána District was sanctioned last year and Veterinary Graduate P. D'Souza was appointed on the 1st July 1902. A station- ary dispensary was established in Thána on the 15th October 1902. The total number of animals treated by visits to owners' houses and as out-patients at the dispensary is given in the body of the report as 123, but this does not tally with the numbers given in the appendices. Appendix (Table XIX14 on Police cases were also made. Two animals only were castrated during the year. The Veterinary Graduate visited Ahmedabad and Thásra 5 times and selected 747 bullocks out of about 1,500 for purchase by Government from charitable funds. Plague was very prevalent during the last three months of the year, otherwise the number of cases would have shown an increase. The daily attendance, however, increased from 35.8 to 37.0 and it may be noted that 35 per cent. of the total number of cases came from surrounding villages in the district. No rinderpest or other epizootic disease occurred. Veterinary Gradu- ate Maniar's report is satisfactory. Kaira Itinerant. 40. Veterinary Graduate V. D. Patel.15 is an accepted fact so ordinary that a few deaths here and there do not even create comment: only an outbreak disseminating a locality forces itself to notice by its mere size just as any other calamity would do which affects communities and not individuals only. Animal diseases in the ordinary way are no concern of any one's and will never be taken cognizance of except by persons especially appointed to deal with them and nothing else. Mámlatdárs and other Native officials who are supposed to report outbreaks of disease in animals have generally speaking too much to do to take any interest in such commonplace events as the death of a bullock here and there, besides which they are entirely ignorant of animal diseases.

The progress of the Department in horse-breeding in the last two years is contrasted in the following table :2 Other kinds of cattle disease were reported from nine districts including the Bombay City ; out of some 2,500 cases in the Presidency one-fourth proved fatal ; and out of 500 cases in Sind one-half. A comparison of these figures with the total number of cattle existing in the Presidency 9,400,000 and in Sind 3,000,000 shows the enormous possibilities of useful work in ascertaining and treating out- breaks that lie before the Department. 10. Since the publication of the decision to concentrate the work of the Civil Veterinary Department chiefly on the treatment of cattle disease and the improvement of breeds of cattle, the Superintendent has been collecting infor- mation on points which have hitherto received little attention. Major Joslen's theories on rinderpest infection and on the castration of bull-calves are interest- ing and deserve further investigation. An experiment is being conducted on the Manjri Farm on the comparative growth of castrated and uncastrated bull- calves. Year. No. 1892-93 ... 3 APPENDIX. Reference to erroneous figures.

From THE PRINCIPAL, Bombay Veterinary College ; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department. Bombay Veterinary College, 16th May 1903. SIR, I have the honour to submit the annual report of the Glanders and Farcy Department in Bombay for the official year 1902-1903, for a major portion of which Veterinary-Major J. Brodie-Mills held the office of Principal. 2. During the year, 15 horses were admitted to the Lazaretto as against 20 and 20 horses in 1901-1902 and 1900-1901, respectively. Out of this number, 2 were destroyed as glandered and 13 were suspicious. Of the suspicious cases, 6 reacted to the mallein test and were destroyed, thus bringing up the total number of glandered cases to 8 as against 6 and 3 in 1901-1902 and 1900-1901, respectively. Of the 7 remaining horses, 5 were found to be suffering from Lymphangitis Epizootica (of which 4 died and 1 was destroyed in accordance with the Act) and 2 were returned to their owners as they did not react to the mallein test. Of the admissions, 4 horses belonged to Arab dealers, 9 to owners of carriages plying for hire, 1 to a private individual and 1 was ownerless. Of the 8 horses that were destroyed for Glanders, 4 belonged to Arab dealers and 4 to owners of carriages plying for hire. Of the 5 horses that died from Lymphangitis Epizootica, 4 belonged to owners of carriages plying for hire and 1 to a private individual. The 15 horses admitted to the Lazaretto were all Arabs. 3. During the year under report, 5,482 horses, donkeys and mules were imported (vide Appendix No. 1) as against 5,055 and 4,825 in 1901-1902 and 1900-1901, respectively. The Australian imports were 1,476 horses and 142 ponies as against 1,393 horses and 298 ponies and 1,738 horses and 119 ponies in 1901-1902 and 1900-1901, respectively. The Arab imports stood at 1,808 horses and 786 ponies as against 1,802 horses and 927 ponies and 1,561 horses and 862 ponies in 1901-1902 and 1900-1901, respectively. The Persian imports were 333 horses and 24 ponies as against 206 horses and 11 ponies and 144 horses and 10 ponies in 1901-1902 and 1900-1901, respectively. The Austro-Hungarian imports were 70 horses as against 31 horses and 4 ponies and 98 horses and 1 pony in 1901-1902 and 1900-1901, respectively. This year 627 mules were imported as against 267 and 176 in 1901-1902 and 1900-1901, respectively. Out of the 627 mules, 500 came from America, 126 from the Persian Gulf, and 1 from Australia. The percentage of casualties en route was as follows :2 4. During the year under report, the following horse and donkey stallions were landed and received by this Department for despatch to the Babugarh Depôt :3 APPENDIX I.

No. 475 OF 1904 From MAJOR E. JOSLEN, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency ; To THE UNDER SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay Poona, 30th June 1904. SIR, I have the honour to submit, for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council, the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department for the official year 1903-1904.

ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1993-1904 PART I.4 5. At the close of the year there were in the non-selected districts 3 arab horse stallions and 9 arab and 1 kathi pony stallions. These were standing as shown on the attached map at the following places :5 This shows a satisfactory increase in the percentage of produce with a cor- responding fall under "not held." The increase in the results unknown is due to information not having been received from the Dahivádi stand in the Sátára District where 13 mares were covered ; also the Itinerating Veterinary Graduate, Kaira, who has supplied the horse-breeding statistics in that district, states that he did not find sufficient time to check the results of 18 mares and consequently they have been returned as unknown. It is hoped that more accurate inform- ation will be obtained in future from Stand officers in the Horse-Breeding Return D which has been lately introduced. (4).6 attacked by the various infective diseases was 7,650 as compared to 2,488 last year. Of these 4,647 or 60.75 per cent. proved fatal as against 674 or 27.09 per cent. last year. The increase was due to "Black-quarter" which prevailed throughout the Presidency. (2).7 cattle-breeding farm. Plans and estimates for a cattle-rearing farm at Sholápur have also been prepared and submitted with letter No. 464 of 21th June 1904 from the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, to the Director of Land Records and Agriculture. The Chinchli Cattle Fair was visited by the Superintendant, Civil Veterinary Department. Particulars of this fair were asked for but not received. Mr. Buxy, Special Assistant to the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, toured in the districts of Ahmed- nagar, Sholápur and Thána for the purpose of enquiring into cattle-breeding, &c. He also attended the Mahsa Cattle Fair in the Thána District. Reports submitted with letters Nos. 159 of 28th February 1904, 1123 of 9th October 1903, 226 of 9th April 1904, and 73 of 26th January 1904, respectively, to the Director of Land Records and Agriculture. The Chharodi Cattle Farm was visited several times by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department. About three dozen photographs of different breeds of cattle in the Presi- dency were taken by provincial photographers for the late officiating Deputy Director of Agriculture. These were handed over to me by him, but they are unsuitable for reproduction. Some photographs of cattle taken by myself in the Krishna valley were accidentally spoilt. V.8 otice by me." He also says, "Last year foot and mouth disease was far widely broken out and it attacked herds of cattle unlike Charbon Symptoma- tique which attacks one animal in a herd and disappears." The Veterinary Graduate paid 72 visits to animals at their owners' houses. In this connection he remarks "I have relieved a cow suffering from dystokia (difficult parturition) at the dead of night. I do not find any reason why my services should be utilized by the well-to-do people who can afford to pay my troubles when 1 call upon their animals in their sheds." In one case in which the viscera of an animal were sent to the Chemical Analyser at Bombay, the cause of death was found to be poisoning. The name of the poison is not stated. The Veterinary Graduate appears to have had outbreaks of disease to cope with which were far beyond the power of any one man to deal with with any measure of success. Dhulia. 21.

The total number of animals treated was 2,709 as against 2,129 the previous year9 further remarks:10 were carried out, but in giving these the Veterinary Graduate states:11 latter runs a very rapid course, and as the reports usually take some length of time to reach me through the proper channel I could do hut little. Fortunately, however, it nowhere broke out in a virulent form." Twelve villages were visited. The number of visits paid to owners' stables was 289 as against 250 last year. Ex-King Theebaw continued to avail himself of the Graduate's services for the treatment of his horses. The Veterinary Graduate was absent 15 days in May on privilege leave and was on deputation from the 9th of September to the 22nd October at the Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory at Muktesar for instruction in preventive inoculation for rinderpest. The Veterinary Graduate states that "the long-felt want of a suitable building for the dispensary has at last been removed." A suitable site has been approved of situated "in the heart of the town." His report is satisfactory. Kolába. 30. Mr. V. R. Pitke in charge.12 goats, the property of the pinjrápol, during the last Bakeri Id. He visited an outbreak of gloss-anthrax at Nivarsad, 10 miles from Ahmadabad, four times; also the adjoining villages Jannitpura, Adalaj, and Khonaj, to inspect the cattle at those places. He visited the Chharodi Cattle Farm three times. He paid about 159 visits to owners' houses to treat their animals; gave opinions as to feeding, work, pregnancy, etc., in connection with 123 animals brought to him; treated sick animals belonging to the Municipality and remounts belong- ing to the Police, and inspected about 250 horses belonging to the Ahmadabad City and Cantonment public land conveyances. Voluntary donations to the amount of Rs. 256 as against Rs. 285 last year were made to the institution. An open space of land to the north of the hospital and directly opposite it has been secured and will afford a much needed and very useful extension of the premises which were a good deal crowded during the daily attendance of patients. No indent for European medicines was submitted during the year, a well known Jain shet residing in the city having subscribed Rs. 200 during his wife's illness towards the institutions and the pinjrápol. Out of this amount Rs. 61-18-0 were spent in the purchase of medicines for the dispensary. The Veterinary Graduate gave cattle owners and breeders advise as to the treatment of their cattle in health and disease, and exercised a friendly supervision from time to time over the stables of private persons and imparted instruction to grooms, stablemen and others. In forwarding the Veterinary Graduate's report the Collector of Ahmadabad remarks:13 Mr. P. D. Maniar at the Nadiád Veterinary Dispensary. Of the total number of cases treated 1,092 were new ones and 9 remained at the end of last year. Of the 1,092 new cases 72 were horses, 427 bullocks, 18 cows, 330 buffaloes, 118 calves, 105 goats, 11 dogs, and 11 others. The daily average attendance was 29.7; of these 12.9 were epizootic cases (398 foot and mouth disease and 17 gloss- anthrax) treated in the villages where they occurred. The above cases of foot and mouth disease occurred in 4 villages in the Anand Táluka and 2 villages in the Nadiád Táluka. Five of these were visited by Mr. Patel and one by Mr, Maniar of Nadiád. The cases of gloss-anthrax occurred in 2 villages in the Anand Táluka, in 2 in the Mehamadábád Táluka, in 2 in the Borsad Táluka, and in 1 in the Nadiád Táluka. These were visited by Mr. Patel. Advice and opinion as to age, soundness, pregnancy, etc., was given in 60 cases, and 75 visits were paid to animals at their owners' houses. In addition to the above duties the Veterinary Graduate visited the Panch Maháls where he treated 29 cattle in 19 villages for black-quarter. He worked as a Member of the Táluka Local Board, Anand, and made enquiries in connection with cattle-breeding in the district. He also collected information in connection with horse-breeding. Although the total number of cases treated by the Veterinary Graduate is not large I am of opinion that his work has been satisfactory. Surat. 35. Veterinary Graduate M. F.

In all 2,660 miles were travelled by road and 12,497 miles by rail by the Special Assistant to the Superintendent in connection with outbreaks of cattle disease, chiefly in districts where no Veterinary Graduate or assistant was employed, and in collecting information relating to cattle-breeding. The majority of the outbreaks of cattle disease were found to be "black-quarter" which has been very general in the Presidency. In his report Mr. Buxy states:15 TABLE I. GOVERNMENT OF BOMBAY.

13 TABLE XXIVREVIEW BY THE DIRECTOR, LAND RECORDS AND AGRICULTURE, BOMBAY. No. A/5284 OF 1904 Poona, 24th August 1904, Submitted to Government. 2. The chief event of the year has been the transfer to the Army Re- mount Department of the best horse-breeding districts, Poona and Ahmednagar, together with three-fourths of the stallions belonging to the Department. Since the Army Remount Department made their selection of the whole stock, the 12 stallions not taken over were naturally the least satisfactory. Of these five died or were destroyed. Seven stallions have been added to the strength, but since there are 17 stands in all in the non-selected districts in which stallions should be located, a further addition of 4 stallions was required at the end of the year. Sufficient provision exists in the budget for these purchases, and the Superintendent has been requested to take the necessary measures. 3. Since the full complement of stallions is 50 mares per annum and the average number covered was only 25, half the stallion power failed to be utilized. 4. The abolition of the system of branding of mares, which has been sanctioned since the close of the year, will, it is hoped, lead to the full employ- ment of every stallion. 5. The Ahmedabad Horse Show, which was revived after a lapse of 11 years under somewhat unfavourable conditions, nevertheless demonstrated that good stock still survived in the district in spite of the recent famines. Those breeders who have successfully struggled against the calamities of recent times deserve liberal encouragement and assistance and it is hoped that the Show will not again be discontinued. 6. The cost of the maintenance of stallions has been high, and the Super- intendent is being requested to examine the causes and to effect a reduction if possible in the expenditure. 7. As a result of the transfer of horse-breeding operations the Super- intendent has paid great attention to the questions of cattle-breeding and cattle disease and has collected much useful information. 8. Proposals for the establishment of a bull-rearing dep6t at Sholápur and for assistance from Government to the cattle-breeding farm at Chliarodi, in the Ahmedabad District, are before Government. It is proposed to distribute from the former bulls of the Malvi and Khillari breeds to districts in the Deccan, and from the latter the Kankrej breed to villages in Gujarát. 9. Veterinary Dispensaries continued to do excellent work. A new dis- pensary was opened in the year, at Lárkhána in Sind. 10. Negotiations have been carried on with several District Local Boards for the establishment of new dispensaries, and it is hoped that several districts which are at present unprovided with dispensaries will soon find their way out of the financial difficulties which have so far proved an insurmountable obstacle. 11. It is observed that it was found necessary to close several dispensaries during the absence on leave of Veterinary Graduates and that the graduates in charge of stationary dispensaries attended cases in a very small number of villages. 12. The Director has brought to the notice of District Local Boards the desirability of the employment of the cheaper veterinary agency which has recently been provided by the establishment of classes of Salutris at the Bombay B 4112 Veterinary College. The cost of employing these men is roughly one-third of the cost of employing Veterinary Graduates, and the District Local Boards have been recommended to entertain a Salutri in each stationary dispensary in place of the untrained compounder now employed. If this step were taken, the Salutri would be competent to keep the dispensary open during the absence of the Veterinary Graduate, and it would be possible to send the Veterinary Graduate to attend villages within accessible distance by road or rail and demonstrate to the people in their own villages the value of veterinary assistance. The village ryot would derive more benefit from visits thus paid to important villages on certain fixed days of every month and to cattle markets or fairs than he does at present from the stationary dispensary. 13. Some District Local Boards have accepted these recommendations, and 7 Salutris have been entertained during the year under report. Major Joslen has omitted to refer to the important question of the extension of this cheaper agency of veterinary science. His attention is being called to the point and he is being requested to use every effort to secure their wider employment. 14. Major Joslen and his assistant Mr. Buxy moved about actively in visiting out-breaks of cattle disease and in making enquiries in regard to cattle- breeding. 15. As observed by the Commissioner in Sind the report for Sind contains little information of interest. For horse-breeding purposes the Province has been placed under the super- intendence of an Imperial officer but it would appear desirable that the super- intendence of the Veterinary Dispensaries should be in the hands of an officer of this Government. A proposal to this effect was made in paragraph 7 of letter No. A.-1272, dated 25th March 1903, from this office on which the orders of Government are awaited. 16. A statement is appended of figures erroneously entered in the appendices. H. S. LAWRENCE, Director of Land Records and Agriculture,

From THE PRINCIPAL, Bombay Veterinary College; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department. Bombay Veterinary College, 25th May 1904. SIR, I have the honour to submit the report of the Glanders and Farcy Depart- ment for the official year 1903-1904. 2. During the year, 22 horses were admitted to the Lazaretto as against 15 and 20 in 1902-1903 and 1901-1902, respectively. Out of the admissions, 3 were confirmed cases of Glanders, 14 were suspicious cases of Glanders and 5 of Lymphangitis Epizootica. Of the suspicious cases, 10 reacted to the Mallein test and were destroyed, thus bringing up the total to 13 as against 8 and 6 in 1902-1903 and 1901-1902, respectively. Of the remaining 5 horses, 2 were diagnosed as Lymphangitis Epizootica as against 5 in 1902-1903, and 7 horses were returned to their owners not being diseased. Of the admissions, 11 horses belonged to Arab dealers, 5 to private owners, 3 to owners of carriages plying for hire and 3 were ownerless. Out of the 13 horses destroyed for Glanders, 9 belonged to Arab dealers, 1 to a private individual, 1 to owners of carriages plying for hire and 2 were ownerless. The 2 horses destroyed for Lymphangitis Epizootica belonged to private individuals. The castes of the horses admitted to the Lazaretto were as follows :2 5. Five consignments of horses arrived from Queensland, but no ticks were found on them. One of these shipments arrived without the necessary certificate. Consequently the horses had to be segregated on shore until such time as the certificate was sent to this office by the owners of the vessel that conveyed the animals from Queensland. 6. Owing to certain alterations being carried out by the Port Trust, the Lazaretto at the Docks has been transferred from Mallet Bunder to the Victoria Pock. 7. Veterinary Inspector T. E. Rodrigues, G.B.V.C., took up the appoint- ment of Veterinary Overseer at Babugarh Remount Depot on the 22nd Novem- ber 1903, holding a lien on his appointment in this Department for 12 months. Mr. P. Miranda, G.B.V.C., was appointed to act substantive pro tem. vice Mr. Rodrigues. The Chief Veterinary Inspector and Inspectors in the Department have given me satisfaction in the performance of their duties. 8. Appendix II is the Financial Statement for the year under report. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, J. BRODIE-MILLS, Lieut.-Colonel, I. C. V. D., Principal, Bombay Veterinary College.

ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1904-1905. B 483
No. 520 OF 1905. From K. HEWLETT, ESQUIRE, I. C. V. D., Acting Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency; To THE UNDER SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Poona, 19th July 1905. Sir, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, for the official year 1904-05. 2. This report has been prepared in accordance with the rules laid down in Government Resolution, Revenue Department, No. 1955, of the 8th March 1905. The submission of the report was delayed as the information relating to the Chharodi Cattle Farm had been awaited. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, K. HEWLETT, I. C. V. D., Acting Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency. THROUGH THE DIRECTOR OF LAND RECORDS AND AGRICULTURE, BOMBAY, Poona. B 483ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1904-05. Major F. Joslen was in charge of the office of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, during the whole year. 2. The Superintendent was away from the head-quarters for 195 days during the year and travelled 14,976 miles by rail, 398 miles by road, and 298 miles by boat as against 12,187 by rail, 669 by road and 258 by boat last year. 3. Extensive tours were made in Gujarát, the Deccan and the Southern Marátha Country in connection with cattle-breeding. The following studs were visited in Káthiáwár, viz., Bhávnagar, Pálitána, Junágad, Rájkot and Vánkáner. All Veterinary Dispensaries were inspected. The Horse Shows at Ahmednagar and Ahmedabad and the Cattle Fairs at Mhaswad, Chinchli and Sholápur were attended. Chharodi Cattle Farm was visited 3 times. The Superintendent attended as President of the Board of Examiners at the Bombay and the Panjáb Veterinary Colleges; also at the Army Veterinary School at Poona. I.4 with negative results. If it had existed in districts where there are Veterinary Dispensaries it would almost certainly have been heard of. A few outbreaks of cattle disease reported as Rinderpest have on investigation turned out to be Black quarter or Septicaemia hæmorrhagica. At the largest Cattle Pairs the Superintendent has personally examined the majority of the cattle present, several thousand from all parts of the Deccan, without finding a case of Rinder- pest. The weekly Cattle Fair at Ahmedabad (the cattle mart for Gujarát), where a thousand or more cattle are usually present from all parts of Gujarát, is attended by the Veterinary Graduate at Ahmedabad, but he has found no case of the disease. (2) Other Diseases. 7. There were 276 cases of other diseases, i. e., diseases not named in the report or not properly diagnosed. Besides this the Veterinary Assistants treated 2,717 cases for non-contagious diseases on tour during the year. (3) Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries. 8. There were in all 18 Veterinary Dispensaries open at the end of the year as against 17 last year, an additional dispensary having been newly started at Nandurbár in the Khándesh District as an experimental measure. The total number of animals treated as in and out-patients as shown in Table V is 25,614 as against 25,758 last year. III.5 were 17 stallions, viz., 5 horses and 12 ponies located at the stands noted below:6 in this Presidency, and consequently there was scarcely any spontaneous compe- tition for prizes. On the contrary people regarded the proceedings with suspicion, trying to find out the purpose of Government. Those, however, who got prizes appeared very well pleased, and it is hoped there will be some competition next year. IV.7 Násik Itinerant. 24. Veterinary Graduate H. R. Kshirsagar. Inspected on the 12th August 1904 at Násik. The head-quarters of this dispensary have lately been removed to Manmád in order to have veterinary help readily available in the east as well as in the west of the district. The Veterinary Graduate visited 92 villages and treated 914 cases as against 654 last year. Out of the above number 41 were horses, 792 cattle, 60 buffaloes, 21 sheep and goats and 10 dogs. His work has been satisfactory. Poona District. 25. Officer in charge Mr. D. D. Sanga and the Resident Officer Veteri- nary Graduate Sethna. Inspected on the 23rd June 1904. The total number of cases treated was 1,044 as against 945 last year. Out of this 338 were horses, 194 cattle and 512 other animals (mostly dogs). Four ponies and 6 bulls were castrated during the year. Mr. Sanga's work at the dispensary has been satisfactory. Poona City Branch. 26. Veterinary Graduate T. N. Marathe. Inspected on the 27th June 1904. The total number of cases treated was 1,489 as against 990 of the last year. Out of this 548 were horses, 549 cattle, 143 buffaloes, 51 sheep and goats, 186 dogs, 3 cats, 4 parrots, 3 donkeys and 2 monkeys. The Veterinary Graduate castrated one pony and paid several visits to private stables. The dispensary has been freely taken advantage of by the people of the neighbouring villages. The treatment charges, however, have been complained of as the people cannot afford to pay them. Mr. Marathe has done good work during the year. Belgaum. 27. Veterinary Graduate D. S. Modak. Inspected on the 18th April and again on the 18th September 1904. The dispen- sary has now been removed to the new building where there is sufficient accommodation for in-patients. The total number of cases treated during the year was 1,471 (1,458 new and 13 old) as against 1,314 last year. Out of the 1,45S new cases, 220 were horses, 620 cattle, 159 buffaloes, 59 goats, 378 clogs and 22 others. There was an outbreak of Gloss anthrax in 2 villages and of Charbon symptomatique in 4. In all 48 animals were attacked, of which 19 died. The. Veterinary Graduate performed 14 castrations successfully, paid 138 visits to owners' stables, visited the Chinchli and Mhas- wad Cattle Fairs, attended the Police horses and Municipal cattle; also inspected animals attending the weekly cattle markets. His work has been satisfactory. Chikodi. 28. Veterinary Graduate D. B. Mamtora. Inspected on the 23th Nov- ember 1904. The total number of animals treated during the year was 919 as against 1,033 last year. The cause of decrease has not been explained. Out of. the above number 131 were horses, 747 cattle and 41 other animals. The Veterinary Graduate cas- trated 1 colt and 2 bulls, visited 4 villages and treated 25 animals for conta- gious diseases (not named in the report). Dhárwár. 29. Veterinary Graduate R. N. Sane. Inspected on the 19th Septem- ber 1904. The total number of cases treated was 2,793 as against 1,866 last year. Out of this num- ber 132 were horses, 1,107 bullocks, 333 cows, 376 buffaloes, 378 calves, 50 goats, 379 dogs and 38 others. Besides the above number 131 cases were treated in 8 villages. Foot and mouth disease was prevalent throughout the year, to which fact is mainly due the large increase in the number of cases treated. Anthrax was reported from 2 tálukás, but the reports were received too late by the Veterinary Graduate to be of any use. There were in all 59 attacks and 55 deaths from this disease. The Veterinary Graduate castrated 1 horse and paid 86 visits to owners' houses. He visited the Chinchli Cattle Fair, attended the animals belonging to the Municipality and the Prison dairy and occasionally visited the weekly cattle markets. Ratnágiri. 30. Veterinary Graduate V. R. Mudliar. Inspected on the 18th Nov- ember 1904. The total number of cases treated at the dispensary was 805 beside 2,168 cases treated in the district away from the head-quarters, i. e., a total of 2,973 as against 1,358 last year. Foot and mouth disease broke out in 5 tálukás and Anthrax in 2 villages. The Veterinary Graduate observes that reports of outbreaks reached him more regularly and thus enabled him to move actively in the district and render valu- able assistance. The Veterinary Graduate paid 481 visits to owners' stables as against 289 last year, the increase being duo to "the growing popularity of
8 the institution." It would appear also to be due to an increase of Foot and mouth disease. The Veterinary Graduate's work has been satisfactory. Kolába. 31. Mr. V. R. Pitke in charge. Inspected on the 20th November 1904 The total number of cases treated was 1,822 as against 3,049 last year. The decrease of 2,127 cases is mainly due to the non-prevalence of Foot and mouth disease throughout the year. Out of the total number treated there were 100 horses, 968 cattle, 240 buffaloes, 290 calves, 88 sheep and goats, 115 dogs and the rest other animals. Besides the above number Mr. Pitke visited 11 villages and treated 40 animals for con- tagious diseases and 6 for non-contagious ones. He paid 23 visits to owners' stables and once attended the Magistrate's Court to give expert opinion as to the age of a bullock. The shoeing forge attached to the dispensary was abolished on the 18th June 1904 under the orders of the District Local Board. Mr. Pit- ke's work has been satisfactory. Thána. 32. Inspected on the 22nd July 1904. Veterinary Graduate P. D'Souza got an appointment in the Array Veterinary Depart- ment at Babugarh and Veterinary Graduate Phatak was appointed in his place on the 16th April 1904. A Salutri has also been appointed during the year to tour through the district. The number of cases treated at the dispensary was 668 as against 560 last year. The Salutri visited 103 villages and treated 219 cases. There were 4 outbreaks reported, 1 of Surra, 2 of Gloss anthrax and 1 of Foot and mouth disease. The Veterinary Graduate visited the Mhasa Cattle Fair and attended the weekly cattle market at Kurla. He has also been in charge of the slaughter-house and market of the Thána Municipality for which he gets an extra allowance of Rs. 10 per month. Surat. 33. Veterinary Graduate M. F. Vakharia was in charge till the 14th March 1905, when he handed over charge to Veteri- nary Graduate V. P. Nagarshet. Inspected on the 6th November 1904. The total number of cases treated was 1,381 as against 1,405 last year. The decrease is said to be due to the prevalence of plague in the city for 4 months, also to the starting of an Itinerating Veterinary Dispensary which afforded facilities to the people to have their animals treated where they were kept rather than to have them sent a long distance to the city. Of the total number treated 499 were horses, 585 cattle, 31 buffaloes, 131 sheep and goats, 99 dogs and 36 others. Veterinary Graduate Vakharia castrated 5 horses for vice, paid 36 visits to owners' houses, also visited Government Agri- cultural Farm at Attawa, the Mounted Police stables and the Pinjrápole. He attended the Magistrate's Court 4 times to give professional evidence. His work has been satisfactory. The Salutri D. P. Thakar was appointed in May 1904. He visited 51 villages and treated 663 animals in the district. He has done good work. Nadiád. 34. Veterinary Graduate P. D. Maniar. Inspected on the 8th Novem- ber 1904. The total number of cases treated was 2,496 as against 2,724 last year. The decrease of 228 is said to be due to the prevalence of plague and to the unfavourable condition owing to the failure of rains. Out of the total number treated there were 262 horses, 1,878 cattle and 356 other animals. The Veterinary Graduate paid 78 visits to owners' houses in the Nadiád Town and 16 in villages. There was no outbreak of any contagious disease except Foot and mouth disease to a small extent. He attended the Magistrate's Court three times to give professional evidence. Nearly one-third of the total number of animals treated came from the surrounding villages, which shows that the dispensary is growing in popularity and is becoming widely known. The Veterinary Graduate's work has been satisfactory. Kaira Itinerant. 35. Veterinary Graduate V. D. Patel. Inspected on the 8th Novem- ber 1904. The dispensary was kept working through- out the year; during the 4 months of monsoon it was stationed at Anand and during the remaining 8 months of the fair season it moved systematically through all the tálukás of the district and visited 65 villages. The total number of cases treated was 1,518 as against 1,101 last year. Of this 153 were horses, 775 cattle, 371 buffaloes, 136 calves and the remainder sheep and goats, etc. One hundred and seven visits were paid to owners' houses; advice was given in 75 cases as to health, age, soundness, pregnancy, etc. The Veterinary Graduate attended one outbreak of Gloss anthrax and one of Foot
9 and mouth disease in the Kaira District and an outbreak of Charbon sympto- matique in the Panch Maháls. There were. 133 cases of Gloss anthrax, of which 99 died and Charbon Symptomatique attacked 18 animals, all of which died. In addition to the dispensary work he collected information in connection with horse breeding. His work has been satisfactory. Ahmedabad. 86. Veterinary Graduate J. K. Bhat inspected on the 7th November 1904. The total number of animals treated was 3,548 as against 3,335 last year. Out of this number 1,031 were horses, 1,517 cattle, 294 sheep and goats, 518 dogs, 17 camels, 130 asses, 24 birds, and 17 others. The daily average attendance was 93.3 as against 84.0 last year. The Veterinary Graduate visited the weekly cattle market on every Friday and was always particular to see if there was any animal affected with a contagious disease, but fortunately he found no such animal in the market. He inspected in this way about 20,000 animals during the year. He visited the Government stallions at Ahmedabad once or twice a week usually and as often as was necessary at other times, assisted in the preparation for the Ahmedabad Horse Show and the classification of the exhibits, etc., visited the local Pinjrapole once a week, and its branch at Ranchorda, which contains about 3,000 animals, was visited twice. He paid two visits to a suspicious case of disease in the Ahmedabad Cantonment, visited three villages for an outbreak of Gloss- Anthrax, paid 168 visits to owners' houses, and gave opinion in the case of 144 animals as to food, age, work, pregnancy, etc. He treated animals belonging to the Municipality, Mounted Police, the Lunatic Asylum, and the Agricultural Farm. He inspected about 300 horses belonging to the public land conveyance of the City and the Cantonment. Voluntary donations were received to the amount of Rs. 250 as against Rs. 256 last year. No indent for European medicines was submitted this year also as Rs. 121-13-0 were spent out of the last year's donation of Rs. 200 in purchasing medicines locally. The Veterinary Graduate prepared and collected at his own expense specimens of different kinds of shoes for horses and bullocks in order to instruct the farriers and owners of animals for shoeing in health and disease. Mr. Bhat's work continues to be very satisfactory. Work done by the Special Assistant to the Superintendent, Mr, Buxy, G. B. V. C. 37. Mr. Buxy travelled in all 6,198 miles by rail, and 1,524 miles by road, as against 12,497 and 2,660 respectively last year. He visited the districts of Poona, Sholápur, Sátára, Bijápur, Thána, Surat, Broach, Ahmedabad, and the Panch Maháls, either in connection with outbreaks of cattle disease or to collect information relating to cattle breeding. He attended the annual Cattle Pair at Mhasa, Thána District, visited the Chharodi Cattle Farm, collected specimens of "Black quarter" for despatch to the Imperial Bacteriologist at Muttesar, and treated the Government stallion "Faran" at Sholápur. He also attended with the Superintendent the Cattle Fairs held at Mhaswad (Sátára District) and at Sholápur. At Mhaswad he made all arrangements regarding the classification of exhibits, etc., as the Mámlatdár and his staff, not knowing what was required, had done nothing before he arrived there. Mr. Buxy toured in the districts of Poona, Broach and Surat in connection with cattle breeding and was to have toured in the districts of Sátára, Belgaum, Bijápur, and Dhárwár in March, but owing to illness the latter had to be postponed to a future date. He has done very useful work-during the year. Expenditure of the Department. 38. The information on this head has been supplied by the Accountant General, Bombay, in the prescribed form. It will be seen from Table XIV-A that the total expenditure of the Civil Veterinary Department in the Bombay Presidency during the year under report amounted to Rs. 192,531 of which Rs. 45,003, being the salaries of officers, were debited to the Imperial Funds, Rs. 83,212 were paid from Provincial Funds, and the balance (Rs. 64,316) was charged to Local Funds. It may be noticed here that a contribution of Rs. 1,000 was made by the Government of India towards prizes to be awarded at Cattle Fairs in this Presidency, but the amount has not been shown by the Accountant General in Table XIV-A, column 2, against entry No. 10. From B 483 -3

35 REVIEW BY THE DIRECTOR, LAND RECORDS AND AGRICULTURE, BOMBAY. No. A/6432 OF 1905. Poona, 1st September 1905. Submitted to Government. Veterinary Instruction. 2. A separate report has already been submitted to Government on the administration of the Veterinary College, Parel, and no further remarks are necessary here. It is suggested that the two reports may usefully be published together in future. Treatment of diseases. 3. The Presidency enjoyed a remarkable immunity from contagious diseases during the year and has been free from rinderpest for the last two years. Breeding operations. 4. The practice of maintaining stud bulls for the improvement of cattle- breeding has hitherto been adopted in this Presidency in a few isolated instances only. The ryots depend to a greater extent than in most provinces on the importation of their bullocks from neighbouring places and Provinces; e.g. the best Gujaráti cattle come from Pálanpur and adjoining tracts in Rájputána; and the Málwa cattle, which are especially popular in the Deccan, come from Central India. It is probable therefore that local bodies do not attach the same importance to cattle breeding as in other provinces of India. Mistakes too have been made in the past in procuring unsuitable bulls for mating with local cattle. But with the establish- ment of the bull-breeding farms at Chhárodi and Sholápur the Civil Veterinary Department will shortly be in a position to distribute bulls of the breeds most highly esteemed by the cultivators and local bodies will be able to undertake this branch of their duties with more confidence. A few bulls have already been distributed from Chhárodi with favourable results. Horse-breeding. 5. The abolition of the system of branding mares has as was anticipated led to the fuller employment of stallions. Fairs and Shows. 6. The hopes entertained of the revival of horse-breeding in the Ahmed- abad District have received further encouragement from the results of the last horse-show. In order to determine this point conclusively, it is important that the show should continue to receive liberal support from Government for a series of years. Cattle Fairs. 7. The experiment of the grant of prizes at cattle fairs was revived after many years' disuse, and no conclusion as to its utility can be based on the first experiment. The people were inclined to suspect that Government intended to impress the cattle for military purposes or else to buy them for the meat market. Subordinate establishment. 8. It has been decided to abandon the attempt to train sálutris in the vernaculars of the Presidency; and the charge of Veterinary Dispensaries will be entrusted only to assistants who obtain the English diploma of the Veterinary College. An important scheme for the development of the Department has been submitted to and approved by the Bombay Government and awaits the sanction of superior authority. Veterinary Dispensaries. 9. There are 18 Dispensaries in the Presidency Proper and 5 in Sind New Dispensaries were established at Nandurbár and Lárkhána. The number of cattle treated amounted to 30,700 in the Presidency and 9,000 in Sind. The Dispensaries continued to do very good work, but the number of villages visited and of cattle treated outside Head-quarter Dispensaries are still insufficient (vide Table IV). It is observed B48336 that the Poona Dispensary has a large balance of Rs. 8,500 and the advis- ability of constructing a suitable building for the City Dispensary is being brought to the notice of the District Local Board. The Shikárpur Dispensary also has a balance exceeding Rs. 12,000 and the Board is being invited to consider the employment of an additional Itinerant Veterinary assistant. A benefaction of Rs. 32,250 was received under the will of the late Mr. E. Pratt, and has been distributed between the District Local Boards of Bijápur, Sholápur and Panch Maháls for the construction of Veterinary Dispen- saries which they have agreed to maintain. 10. Major Joslen and his Assistant Mr. Buxy moved about actively in visiting outbreaks of cattle diseases and in making enquiries in regard to cattle-breeding. 11. Owing to changes in the administration of the Department in Sind that Province received no professional supervision during the year. 12. The attention of the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, may be invited to the remarks in paragraphs 40 and 41 regarding the pre- scribed forms. H. S. LAWRENCE, Director of Land Records and Agriculture. BOMBAY : PRINTED AT THE GOVERNMENT CENTRAL PRESS.
Civil Veterinary Department. Annual. Administration Report of the 2 3. The Governor in Council entirely concurs with the Director's remarks regarding the improvement required in the matter of visiting villages. His impression is that in other parts of India far more extensive work is achieved in this line. The reports of other Provinces should be examined and, if the results are as stated, their methods should be ascertained and any useful hints adopted. 4. The Governor in Council much regrets that Sind should have remained uninspected during the year of report, and is glad to hear that a Superintendent for Sind is in future to have his head-quarters at Karachi. 5. The attention of the Inspector General, Civil Veterinary Department, should be invited to paragraphs 40 and 41 of Mr. Hewlett's report. 6.

The following studs were visited in Káthiáwár, viz., Bhávnagar, Pálitána, Junágad, Rájkot and Vánkáner. All the stallion stands were visited, some several times, and all the Veterinary Dispensaries were inspected, with the exception of the Itinerating Dispensary, Dhárwár, which was only opened on January 17th, 1906. The Horse and Cattle Shows at Ahmednagar and Ahmedabad and the Fairs at Mhaswad and Sholápur were attended. The site of the proposed Cattle Farm at Sholápur was visited six times and Chharodi Cattle Farm eight times. The Superintendent acted as adviser to the Gujarát Cattle Preservation Society from August to the end of the year, attended as member of the Board of Examiners at the Bombay Veterinary College in December and conducted the special examination there in March.

He inoculated 13 animals against rinderpest in the Bársi Táluka of the Sholápur District in March. He has done very useful work during the year and has proved himself an exceptionally energetic and capable Veterinarian. V.12 TABLE II.

24 TABLE XIVNo. 3-C. Address27 SIND. ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT I SIND FOR THE YEAR 1905-1906. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. During the year under report Captain W. O. Dawson held charge of the office of Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistan and Rájputána, up to March 29th, 1906, when he proceeded on leave to Europe and Mr. K. Hewlett assumed charge in addition to his own duties as Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, pending further orders. The Head-quarters of the Superintendent were transferred from Ajmer, in Rájputána to Karáchi in December 1905. 2. The Superintendent travelled 3,094 miles by rail and 387 miles by road. 3. Captain Dawson made an extensive tour in the Hyderabad District in order to report on what operations might be undertaken with regard to cattle breeding. He chose this district as he considered it the most important in Sind and as he was unable, owing to want of time, to make extensive tours in all districts. 4. The following Tálukás were visited:28 12. There is great need of a Lazaretto in Karachi. 13. A very serious outbreak of "Foot and Month disease" took place in Thar and Párker District and the Salutri attached to Nausháhro (Hyderabad District) Veterinary Dispensary attended. He was able to treat 64 Bovine and 12 others successfully. 14. Hæmarrhagic Septiæmia is reported to have broken out in the Lar- kána District; 32 deaths occurred*. 15. Others.29 30. Nausháhro Dispensary.30 Cattle Fairs could be started advantageously in connection with them, and he was of opinion that an attempt should be made to start them as an experimental measure. IV.31 that in a few years very great improvements will be noticeable as regards cattle breeding, Veterinary dispensaries and the handling of contagious diseases. I have hopes that a cattle breeding dep6t and several new dispen- saries will be started in the early future. There are most excellent cattle in Sind and all that is wanted to improve them is good sire cattle and proper breeding supervision. All old dwellers in Sind however say that year by year the cattle are becoming smaller and worse milkers and unless some- thing is done I am afraid in a few years the breed will become on a par with that of Rájputána where good cattle are now absolutely extinct although there used to be there one of the best breeds in India. The want of a good Deputy Superintendent is greatly felt in this large district, and I hope when Government decide to appoint one that the post will be given to one of the senior Graduates who have done so many years of good work in Sind and not to an outsider. This appointment would always act as a stimulus, to young graduates. Several new dispensaries are badly needed in the several districts for treatment of disease. I have mentioned in my reports the places I consider most suitable for a start to be made on." K. HEWLETT, I. C.V. D., In charge Office of Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistan and Rájputána.

37 REVIEW BY THE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE, BOMBAY. No. A/4686 OF 1906. Poona, 30th August 1906. Submitted to Government. 2. Orders have not been received on the suggestion made last year that the report on the administration of the Bombay Veterinary College should be published with the report under review. Consequently the reports are still separately submitted. 3. The Pratt Veterinary Dispensaries at Bijápur, Sholápur and Godhra were under construction during the year. Three new Veterinary Graduates will shortly be entertained and will form a welcome addition to the strength of the Department. With the approval of Government the work in connection with the construction of these dispensaries and of that at Dhárwár was conducted by Mr. McNeill. 4. The reappearance of rinderpest in the Presidency emphasises the weakness of the present Veterinary organization and the necessity for early sanction to the re-organization of the Department on the lines proposed in Government Resolution No. 3877, dated 12th May 1905. Revenue Department. Násik, Nagar, Poona, Thána and Dhárwár. Fortunately Gujarat as usual was only slightly affected. The marginally noted districts are not yet free from the disease and measures for the protection of Bombay City are under consideration. Eight temporary Veterinaiy Gradu- ates were sanctioned after the close of the year, but 3 only were appointed and placed under the Superintendent's orders, a moiety of the charges being borne by the District Local Boards concerned. Six temporary appointments had previously been made by the Local Boards of affected districts at their own expense. The results of these operations will be chronicled in the next year's report, but it may be noted here that the dislike of inoculation by the villagers was not universal and good results were subsequently obtained, notably in the Nagar District. In Bombay City also there was a considerable demand for serum by private practitioners and 390 cattle had been inoculated upto 30th April 1906. It has been shown that an energetic Mámledár with the help of Major Joslen's pamphlet on the disease can successfully explain the benefits of inoculation and overcome all prejudices. Vernacular copies of the pamphlet have since been widely distributed. The supply of Veterinary Graduates who have been trained in inoculation work at Muktesar is limited and steps are now being taken to induce a few Local Boards to allow their untrained men to take the Muktesar course and arrange for the current work at the dispensaries by means of temporary substitutes. In the absence of any contagious diseases ward at the Bombay Veterinary College, Parel, adequate instruction cannot be given in Bombay. The questions of instituting such a ward with a view to make local instruction available and of adding a post-graduate course in pro- phylactic inoculation at Muktesar or elsewhere for the purpose of securing a reserve of such trained men are at present under consideration. 5. There has been a satisfactory increase in the number of villages visited and animals treated while on tour. The figures are given below for ready reference:38 absence of a Compounder at present precludes the introduction of the new scheme. Elsewhere orders have generally been given to pay such visits except where no important villages are easily accessible from head-quarters (Upper Sind Frontier) or a Veterinary Assistant is prevented by special duties from leaving head-quarters (Poona). The full result of these orders will appear in the next year's report. The average number of animals treated on tour per Veterinary Assistant or Salutri was 353 in the Presidency proper and 257 in Sind. The figures for other Pro- vinces and Administrations (1904-1905) vary from 387 (Central Provinces) to 1,619 (Bengal). The experiment is still in its infancy and the comparison is not therefore a fair one. The two full-period itinerating Veterinary Assistants have shown a fair number of cases, and the total cases treated on tour and at head-quarters per Veterinary Assistant compare favourably with the figures of all other provinces except Bengal. The United Provinces figures for 1904-1905 are almost identical with last year's Bombay figures but the distribution as shown below is different:No. 198-L. of 1906. Bombay Veterinary College; Parel, 31st May 1906. From M. H. SOWERBY, ESQUIRE, I.C.V.D., Acting Principal, Bombay Veterinary College; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. SIR, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report of the Glanders and Farcy Department in Bombay for the year 1905-06. During this year Lieut, Colonel Brodie-Mills held charge of the Department up to 21st January 1906. 2. During the year 33 horses were admitted to the Lazaretto at Sewri as against 38 and 22 in 1904-05 and 1903-04, respectively. Out of these 33 horses, 2 were confirmed cases of Glanders, 27 were suspicious and 4 were contacts. Out of the 27 cases, 15 proved to be glandered on being subjected to the Mallein test, 1 was diagnosed as Lymphangitis Epizootica, 9 were found to be suffering from Surra, 1 was returned to its owner and 1 died free from any of the diseases under the operation of the Act. The four contacts having deve- loped no disease while at the Lazaretto were returned to the owners. From the above figures it can be ascertained that 17 cases of Glander were found and destroyed during this year as against 29 and 13 in 1904-05 and 1903-04, respectively. One case of Lymphangitis Epizootica occurred as against 2 and 2 in 1904-05 and 1903-04. Nine cases were destroyed as suffering from Surra which was scheduled under the Act in 1905. Out of the 33 horses admitted 2 belonged to Arab dealers, 10 to private individuals and 21 to owners of carriages plying for hire. Out of the 17 horses destroyed for Glanders, 7 belonged to private indivi- duals and 10 to owners of carriages plying for hire. The horse suffering from Lymphangitis Epizootica belonged to a private individual. Out of the nine horses destroyed for Surra, 1 belonged to the Bombay Tramways Company, 1 to a private individual and 7 to owners of carriages plying for hire. The castes of the horses admitted to the Lazaretto were as follows:2 Five mules arrived from Australia and the Persian Gulf as against 2,268 and 768 in 1904-05 and 1903-04, respectively. Two horses were sent from the Harbour to the Lazeretto, one as a suspicious case and one as a contact. Both of these horses were returned to their owners as they did not react to the Mallein test. The percentage of casualties en route was :3 APPENDIX I. Return showing the details of Animals imported into Bombay during the year 1905-06. Caste. APRIL 1905. MAY 1905. JUNE 1905. JULY 1905.

Civil Veterinary Department. Annual Administration Report of the2 3. The inequality of performance at different dispensaries is still noticeable. Thus Nadiád shows an attendance of nearly 3,400, of which 2,724 were cattle, while Surat shows only 1,706, of which only 624 were cattle. The Veterinary Assistants are described in equal terms of praise. It is not easy, however, to conclude that they were equally energetic, or successful in commending their dispensaries to the appreciation of the public. Again, the Superintendent says that a larger attendance than 735 cannot be expected at a place like Thána; this is not easy to understand when a smaller place like Alibág shows an attendance of 1,494 and Batnágiri an attendance of 1,382. Belgaum with 1,464, also, contrasts unfavourably with Dhárwár with 2,412 notwithstanding the diminished prevalence of foot and mouth disease. The attendance at Lárkána and Jacobabad Dispensaries in Sind is at present almost absurdly small. But both institutions are of recent establishment and will, it is hoped, show improving results. 4. Government will await proposals on the subjects mentioned in para- graph 6 of the Director's review. 5. On other matters dealt with in the reports no special comment is needed. It is noticed with satisfaction that the Superintendent made a comprehensive tour in Sind, where much extension and improvement are required, especially in the matter of cattle-breeding. The Governor in Council is pleased to endorse the Director's commendation of the work done by Mr. Hewlett, and his Assistant, and to observe that the great majority of the establishment also worked conscientiously and efficiently.
