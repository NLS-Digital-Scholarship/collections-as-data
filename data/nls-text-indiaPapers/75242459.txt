Director, Imperial Bureau of Animal Genetics, University of Edinburgh. (Received for publication on 10th January, 1938) OBSERVATION and experiment have shown clearly and conclusively that constant and true-breeding differences in resistance to particular diseases distinguish the species and that in all probability such differences are paralleled by differences which distinguish individuals of one and the same species. This is as would be expected by the geneticist. It is indeed safe to assert that such resistance and susceptibility are genetic, in whole or in part, and that natural selection would tend to eliminate the susceptible and produce a population more resistant than one which had not been subjected to such natural selection. Granting this it follows that the genetic improvement of an animal popula- tion is stopped by any measures that prevent selection. Prophylaxis and therapy must necessarily prevent genetic improvement in respect of resistance because the less resistant are saved to reproduce. There can be little doubt that the resistance of an individual host to a given infection is determined largely by genetic factors but the value and the nature of these factors have not yet been disclosed. We do not know how these factors produce their effects, whether they are specific or non-specific, and we do not know whether such resistance is uni- or multi-factor in its origin. Experiment has shown that between strains of the same species there are differences in mortality from specific infections which are to be referred to genetic differences between the strains. Selective breeding within the strain on the other hand has yielded results which lack uniformity. If resistance NOTE.2 Heredity and Disease Resistance were purely genetic it would be expected that increasing and continued selec- tion would yield an increasing uniformity in genetic constitution and in- creasing uniformity in respect of resistance. But this is not always apparent and it is as yet quite impossible to state that by such means a fixed degree of resistance could be realised. It is not even clear that the manifestation of these genetic qualities is regular and orderly ; resistance would seem in general to be an irregular dominant. The possibility of breeding strains of animals of economic importance with fairly fixed high grades of resistance, at least to a particular agent, seems to be an eminently reasonable proposition. But it has to be confessed that in many of the experiments on the results of which this opinion is based the possibility that environmental factors have been operating has not been de- finitely excluded. To design and to complete an experiment of this magnitude is indeed most difficult; to satisfy the bacteriologist, the geneticist and all the rest who have the right to comment and to criticise, is well-nigh impossible at the present time because of the insufficiency of our knowledge. To the breed- er of animals of economic importance the difficulties are almost overwhelm- ing. He must work with animals known to be free from the particular in- fection under consideration and he must keep them free at least until their progeny have been weaned. To incorporate resistance into a group he must either demonstrate that it is already possessed by certain of the individuals or else introduce it by crossing. Selection of the kind required adds to the number of characters already being selected for and therefore complicates the breeding programme. And if and when he reaches his objective, muta- tion of the pathogen can upset all his plans and force him to begin all over again. It seems probable that where adequate methods of prophylaxis or therapy are known and readily applicable they will, in general, be preferable economic- ally to any attempt to breed for resistance. From the nature of the case the number of diseases to be selected against in any animal stock must neces- sarily be limited and the genetic method should be reserved for those which cannot readily be controlled by other means. It seems rather hopeless to breed for resistance save only on a large scale with animals producing numer- ous progeny rapidly. The plan demands large numbers and large scale elimi- nation. This means, under most conditions, that the genetic method can be employed only in the case of animals, individually of but little commercial value.
A FORM OF VERMINOUS OPHTHALMIA IN EQUINES* BY P. R. KRISHNA IYER, G.M.V.C. Assistant Veterinary Research Officer, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on 9th January, 1938) (With plates I and II) IN certain parts of India, an obscure disease affecting the eyes of horses has been known under the name " Periodic Ophthalmia " for many years. The disease occurs in the horse breeding establishments at Montgomery and Probynabad in the Punjab and during recent years a good many cases of eye affection have been met with. Work on the investigation of this condition was undertaken at this Institute in the year 1934 and the follow- ing information was elicited on enquiry. Although the diagnosis " Periodic Ophthalmia" has been in common use for many years in the affected farms and in Army Veterinary Service, the disease is not by any means periodic, but is rather of a recurrent nature. The disease has been established in the stud farms at Coleyana and Probynabad for several years and probably considerably longer and one or two animals are often becoming affected. The aetiology of this condition has for many years been the cause of much controversy, trauma, dietetic deficiency and bacteria being falsely incriminated. SYMPTOMS Initial stage.4 Verminous Ophthalmia in Equines The intraocular pressure is often increased. These symptoms last for ten to fourteen days and then clear up rapidly. When these symptoms have cleared up, it may be difficult to detect any difference between the affected and unaffected eyes. Intermediary stage.P. R. KRISHNA IYER 5 failed to reproduce the disease. The same negative results were obtained even when these organisms were inoculated sub-conjunctivally. The possibility of any bacteria or a virus being concerned in the causa- tion of this condition was thus eliminated. With a view to elucidate the question of a seasonal incidence, if any, occurring in this condition which if present may be attributed to biting flies and other insects, enquiries were made and the following information was received.

TOTAL . 14 4 10 12 16 10 2 4 8 6 8 17 The above tabular statement indicates that the disease is gradually increasing. It also shows that the disease occurs at all times of the year and as such there is no evidence of a seasonal incidence attributable to it, though in the months of May, December and January, the number of cases were more numerous than during the other months. In the colts sold to the Remount Depots from these stud farms, this eye trouble is not marked. Officers in charge of Remounts report that there is not a heavy incidence. It was observed that district mares and foals were never affected and that the incidence of this disease in Remount Depots in animals sent from these stud farms was very rare. But at Coleyana many cases occur in the young stock and the attacks terminate in blindness. The question arises as to whether the source of infection is also removed when the animals leave the Estate and whether the stock then make a complete recovery. One is, therefore, led to consider what differences there may be in the general conditions between the Stud Farm and the Circles and it would appear to be necessary to review them briefly. Coleyana Circles Concentration of stock . . . Dispersion of stock. Free grazing in grass paddocks . Grazing in most cases limited to crops such as lucerne etc., and grass on banks of water courses.

At certain times of the year, i.e., July and August, very long grass in the paddocks which contains a large admixture of weeds. Probably very few weeds in grazing. Mares foal in the open and young stock and mares live out in the open throughout the year. Young stock and mares stabled at night. Stock watered from tanks. .

KRISHNA IYER 7 In regard to the Delhi Show stock, they are brought up from the pad- docks in about the month of November and are kept in loose boxes at night, but they spend most of the day tethered in the sun. They are carefully groomed and they have no free grazing. It is to be noted that no mares with foals at foot or any stock under 12 months of age are taken up for the Delhi Show. ROUTINE FORM OF TREATMENT ADOPTED 1928. Boric fomentation, Boric acid and formaline in powder. 1929. Boric and zinc lotion, Boric and formaline as above. 1930. Boric and zinc sulphas, Atropine and cocaine solution. 1931. Boric and zinc sulphas, Atropine and cocaine and calomel. 1932. Boric and calomel powder, Atropine and cocaine solution and ad- renaline. 1933. As above and Silver Protargol 10 grains to 1 ounce. 1934. As above and yellow oxide of mercury ointment. Mick treatment 2½ to 5 c.c. subcutaneously every alternate day. It may be said that none of these treatments has had any permanent result. HISTOPATHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION On the 14th May 1935, the lachrymal glands and both eyeballs of Brood mare Nili Chiri were sent to this Institute from the Probynabad Stud Farm. Histological examination of the lachrymal glands revealed the presence of chronic congestion, distinct eosinophilia, haemorrhagic foci, fibrotic changes in the blood vessels and oedematous changes in the parenchyma. Fairly frequent microfilariae were also seen in the stroma of the gland. The conjunctiva and cornea showed changes associated with acute in- flammation, eosinophilic, neutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltration and the presence of variable numbers of microfilariae. On finding the first micro- filaria in the section of the lachrymal gland, the writer was rather doubtful as to whether these parasites were the real cause of the disease or whether their presence was more or less accidental. But their constant presence in all the following specimens, eosinophilia and fibroblastic changes demonstrated conclusively that the microfilariae were the aetiological agents. The lachrymal glands and eyeballs of two more animals, Brood mares Nisri Jan and Amanatdarni of Probynabad Stud Farm were also examined histologically with the same findings as those in Brood mare Nili Chiri. The preservative fluid containing the eyeballs was examined for worms and worm larvae with negative results. The lachrymal glands showed congestion, distinct endarteritis of the vessels in the supporting connective tissue, intense eosinophilia and the presence of a few sections of microfilaria. The cornea at its junction with the sclera showed distinct eosinophilia and mononuclear
8 Verminous Ophthalmia in Equines infiltration and fibroblastic stimulation. The capillary blood vessels were dilated and distended with blood. A few sections of microfilaria were also seen at this junction. The eyeballs from Nisri Jan showed evidence of verminous ophthalmia characterised by the presence of distinct eosinophilia and a few sections of microfilaria. In order that this finding may be confirmed or eliminated in cases that occur at Coleyana, it was requested that from any future case which may become available for destruction, the entire eyeballs and lachry- mal glands be removed and despatched to this Institute for examination and confirmation. The affected eyeballs from three Brood mares Viola, Kronella and Momento belonging to the Coleyana Stud Farm were also examined with the same histological features, eosinophilic infiltration and the presence of microfilaria in sections as those observed in the Probynabad animals. The eyeballs from Brood mare Momento were sent to this Institute preserved in saline solution and this fluid yielded no microfilaria on examination ; however, a few eosino- phile leucocytes were seen in this fluid on examination. The corneal epi- thelium in this animal showed only one layer of epithelial cells in some places whereas elsewhere, the epithelium was found to be completely shed. Intense eosinophilia, mononuclear infiltration of the sclera at its junction with the cornea, and intense vascularity of the choroid coat were the other changes observed. A few microfilariae were also seen in the sections and they were situated in the Substantia propria of the cornea surrounded by a zone of eosinophiles and fibroblasts. Smears of eye-discharge from affected cases were examined many a time for microfilaria with negative results. Samples of tears from affected cases were submitted to chemical examination and it was found that the mineral content of the tears was abnormally high. The finding of filarial parasites (larvae) in the materials from Probynabad and Coleyana Farms indicates that the condition is one of verminous ophthal- mia. With a view to determine the incidence of microfilariae in the eye- balls of normal horse, a few eyeballs of healthy horses were examined for microfilariae with negative results. Treatment with Antimosan and other antimony preparations was recommended in these cases. There were two fresh cases in the spring of 1936 and the symptoms shown were typical of this type of ophthalmia and they were treated quite successfully with anti- mosan. Neither of these two cases recurred. DISCUSSION During the recent years many different affections in horses caused by filarial larvae have been recorded in literature. Lichen tropicus or khoojli is a form of cutaneous microfilariasis affecting the horses in many parts of the world and enquiries were made as to whether any of the affected animals had ever shown lesions of khoojli on their skin with a view to correlate these two conditions but it was found that this latter condition has never been parti- cularly noted in these animals.

P. R. KRISHNA IYER 9 None of these affected animals had ever shown worms in the eye and Filaria oculi are rare in the affected area. Diseases of the eye due to filariasis are not uncommon in cattle in this country. Venkataratnam Chetty [1922] describes a form of ulcerative keratitis which occurred in an epidemic form among the Corporation Depot Bullocks and the Buckingham Mill draught cattle in Madras in the years 1917, 1918 and 1919. The outbreak in the year 1919 resulted in loss of sight in over 40 per cent of the affected animals. The pathological changes observed varied from simple ophthalmia to ulcerative keratitis of one or both the eyes. Examination revealed a few thread like worms each about an inch long, wriggling about on the cornea and a bunch of them might be seen under the eyelid. The worms were identified as Thelazia rhodesi. The author suggests the possibility of their being carried from the eyes from animal to animal by flies. Ramaswamy Iyer [1922] records a similar case of infection of the left eye of a cow with Th. rhodesi. The animal was lachrymating profusely for about a month and could not open the eye freely. The eye was washed with saline solution and five worms were removed. As no more worms could be found, a boric lotion bandage was applied and the animal was allowed to go. About three weeks later, the same animal was brought to his dispensary with lachrymation from both eyes. Now the eyes showed moving worms over the conjunctiva in both eyes, with slight opacity of the left cornea. Over a dozen worms were removed from both eyes. The author states that the parasites cause much irritation, severe conjunctivitis and profuse lachry- mation leading on to opacity of the cornea and impairment of the vision. Griffiths [1922] states that members of the genus Thelazia have their normal habitat in the lachrymal ducts of the eye of various species of mammals and birds and that some fly acts as an intermediate host and transmits the parasite to fresh mammalian hosts. The author thinks that it is among the species of Stomoxys, Musca and allied genera that the transmitting agent may possibly be found, flies of these species being a constant source of annoy- ance to all domestic animals by their habits in attacking the orbital region. He adds that the presence of these parasites in the orbit gives rise to ophthalmia terminating in loss of sight. We have not as yet been able to identify the worm responsible for the causation of this condition, and naturally its life-history is unknown. According to the Helminthologist of this Institute, " From an examination of the microfilariae and their ' unsheathed ' character, it appears that the larvae belong to some Onchocercoid worm. Specific identification is not possible from the microfilariae seen in the sections ". From the data given by Steward [1935], Shafi Mohammed [1931], Cleland [1914] and Heydon, [1927] it would appear that Onchocercoid tumours need not necessarily be found in cases of Onchocercoid infections. The adult C
10 Verminous Ophthalmia in Equines. worms may lead a free life in the tissues and deposit their embryos as they move about. One of these cases was sent to Mukteswar from Coleyana for observation and arrived early in July 1936. This animal, Brood mare Epigram born in 1924 had four affections of the eyes, and on arrival she showed a pin-head sized cataract of the left eye and ulceration of the distal opening of the lachry- mal duct of the off-nostril. Apart from the cataract, her eyes appeared normal. This animal was considered a typical case of this condition by the Coleyana authorities, who thought that she would probably go blind in six months. Since arrival at Mukteswar about a year ago, this animal has not shown any signs of relapse, nor has she gone blind as was anticipated. Blood smears from this animal were examined thrice a week for some months for the presence of microfilaria, with negative results. It is possible that the cool Mukteswar climate has prevented a relapse as it is known to do in case of Lichen tropicus and Bursati. Regarding diagnosis in life, Fairley [1931] describes a complement fixa- tion reaction for filarial disease using an alcohol-soluble extract of Dirofilaria immitis as antigen. The intradermal reaction for Wuchereria bancrofti described by Taliaferro and Hoffman in 1930 was confirmed by this worker and extended further to the diagnosis of Loa loa and Onchocerca volvulus infestations. The author states that both these reactions are essentially group reactions, the scope of which probably includes all the filaroid species of the family and discusses in detail the clinical and theoretical aspects of the combined reactions. This test is not a very reliable one for use in the diagnosis of an infection with Onchocerca worms, as it is not specific for this genus. The specific identity of the worm involved will be discovered only by the finding of the adult worm by means of post mortem examinations of affected animals. SUMMARY Under the name "Periodic Ophthalmia, a disease affecting the eyes of horses in the Stud Farms at Montgomery and Probynabad in the Punjab has been known for some years. The disease is of a recurrent nature and terminates in the affected animals going blind. The disease has no seasonal incidence as it occurs at all times of the year. Mechanical irritation by flies and dust, bacteria and dietetic deficiency were all suspected to be concerned in the causation of this condition and every one of these individual agents was finally eliminated. Histopatho- logical examination revealed the verminous origin of the disease and micro- filariae were found in the sections of the affected eyes and lachrymal glands. The sections also revealed intense eosinophilia, neutrophile and lymphocytic infiltration and fibroblastic stimulation. The disease is comparatively rare in the animals issued to the circles from these farms. The transmitting agent of this condition, when it is found
P. R. KRISHNA IYER 11 may possibly be one of the biting flies as there is concentration of stock in these stud farms, and this naturally leads to a concentration of flies. From an examination of the microfilariae and their ' unsheathed' character, the larvae appear to belong to some Onchocercoid worm. Specific identification was not possible from the microfilariae seen in the sections and only post mortem examinations will solve the question of the identity of the adult worm, when found. Treatment with antimosan and other antimony preparations appear to have an inhibitory effect on the progress of the disease. REFERENCES Abdel Shafi Mohammed (1931). Annals of Trop.

SOME EXPERIMENTS ON THE CAROTENE CONTENT OF GRASSES AND CONCENTRATES AND THE FEEDING OF GUINEA GRASS TO DAIRY COWS BY J. K. MAKHIJANI Post-graduate student Imperial Dairy Institute, Bangalore AND B. N. BANERJEE Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (Received for publication on 28th May, 1937) NUTRITIONAL trials have been performed to increase the vitamin and carotene content in milk and butter-fat of dairy cows. In Western countries a marked difference in carotene and vitamin A content in milk has been observed in pasture-fed as compared with stall-fed cows, and in summer and winter seasons. In India such data are not available, and except in big towns the cattle are mostly pasture fed. Vitamin A determination with milk and butter of cows of the Imperial Institute of Dairying, Bangalore, extend- ing over one year revealed the potency to be nearly constant. However, the food and feeding conditions at the Imperial Dairy are almost ideal and the case is nearly the reverse with the farmer or the Indian goala. Poor as they are, they cannot afford to spare money for feeding their milch cattle except with the grasses of forests and waste lands and the remnants of by- products of crops. The estimation of the carotene content of grasses and fodders, never- theless, is as important as the organic or inorganic analysis of the same. In course of an analytical study of over one hundred and fifty species of grasses in Hawaii and other places, it has been observed that the analysis of a. grass is of little value unless the stage of maturity at which it was cut was pro- perly taken into account [Ripperton et al 1933]. Protein is highest in im- mature plants and crude fibre is higher in maturer ones. Watson [1935] carried out experiments on the conservation of grassland herbage and mea- sured the losses in nutritive value during hay-making. The losses in starch and protein equivalents are serious and of about the same order. Early hay dried at a low temperature, or ensiled with acid (A. I. V. process) or molasses provided a satisfactory method of storing grassland herbage. A wide range of material containing from 10 to 20 per cent of crude protein (13)
14 Carotene Content of Grasses. on the dry matter can be conserved with ease. Quick drying of hay is the least damaging as far as the contents of A, D and C vitamins are concerned [Rygh, 1934]. Silo fodder with a hydrogen ion below 4.2 is considered very good, but when the pH is above 4.9 it is considered poor [Kniest. 1934]. Exposure to sunlight and air causes a rapid decrease in the carotene content of forage [Guilbert, 1934]. A good field-cured product may approximate a dehydrated meal in "Vitamin A " value. There is little or no loss of caro- tene after vacuum drying for three hours at 100°C. Alternatively, by means of machine drying, it is possible to preserve grass cut at an early stage of growth and preserve the nutrients in a much larger amount than can be obtained by hay-making. They can be cut several times during the season and in this way the pigments contained in young growing stage can be re- tained. They contain carotene, xanthophyl and chlorophyl. The first is the precursor of vitamin A and the last two are responsible for quality. Gillam and others' experiments [1933] show that the relatively high propor- tion of carotene, xanthophyl and vitamin A present in summer butter can be maintained during the winter period of stall feeding by the use of arti- ficially dried grass. The carotene and vitamin A contents of milk and butter of cows have been found to be influenced by the breed and the diet of the animal. Caro- tene was highest in Guernsy cows, 10.3J. K. MAKHIJANI AND B. N. BANERJEE 15 in judging the correct stage of maturity at which grasses are to be cut and dried or stored in silo. With the co-operation and help of the Imperial Dairy Institute and different Farm officers a number of grasses and fodders have been obtained and their carotene content determined. They represent the stage at which they are fed to the cattle. The results * are given in Table I. TABLE I Grasses and fodders No. Name Place Carotene in mg. per kg.

The residues were again extracted with acetone till the extracts were free from colour. The aqueous and acetone extracts were then extracted with petro- leum ether, washed with water, dehydrated and made up to a volume. A colorimetric reading was then taken of the total carotinoid content in a Lovibond Tintometer, or against a standard bichromate solution. The carotene content was calculated from Ferguson's curves. The carotinoids consist of carotene and xanthophyl and the proportions of the two were determined by the 'methyl alcohol petroleum ether' partition method. In another rapid method by Pyke [1936] the two processes are combined into one and the extraction is performed in a mixture of ether and methyl alcoholic potash solution. The fraction in ether contains the carotene. One hundred mg. of grass-meal was finely ground and shaken vigourously for five minutes in a centrifuge tube with 10 c.c. of ether and 3 c.c. of 25 per cent solution of potassium hydroxide in methyl alcohol. The ether-layer was drawn off, washed with water and filtered in a sintered glass funnel over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The process was repeated till there was no more of ex- traction possible either from the residue or the methyl-alcohol-layer. The extract was evaporated and the residue dissolved out again in 25 c.c. of ether and an equal volume of 85 per cent methyl-alcohol. The upper ether- layer contained the carotene and the lower alcoholic layer xanthophyl. One or both the methods were tried in the case of grasses and fodders and with the necessary modification in the case of other feeding materials. In the case of blood, Palmer's method has been followed. About 5 c.c. of blood was drawn from the animal and centrifuged to separate the cor- puscles. 2 c.c. of serum was then mixed with about 8 grm. of Plaster of Paris. The paste was then extracted with a mixture of 10 c.c. of alcohol and 5 c.c. of petroleum ether. The extraction was repeated with ether till no more coloured extracts were obtainable. The ether-extract was then washed, dehydrated and colour strength matched against a standard bichro- mate solution to obtain the carotene content. The carotene content was determined in butter after saponification, on the unsaponifiable matter. Six Sindhi young cows of almost equal age and second lactation were selected for the feeding trials. The following basic ration was given per cow, each dayJ. K. MAKHIJANI AND B. N. BANERJEE 27 grass consumed was obtained by subtracting the residue from the quantity provided. The milk-yield was measured each day and the fat percentage was calculated on weekly averages. A weekly average sample of butter was used for carotene and vitamin A estimation. The blood was drawn once a week for carotene estimation.

A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE COLOSTRUM OF THE DAIRY COW AND THE DAIRY BUFFALO BY V. SIVASUBRAMANIAN, G.M.V.C. AND C. W. DOVER, B.Sc. (AG.) Imperial Dairy Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 17th November 1937) No study has so far been made of the composition of the colostrum of buffaloes, and the analysis of the colostrum of the Indian dairy cow has been made only in the Montgomery breed, by Shah [1936]. In this experiment a more detailed analysis of the colostrum of cows and buffaloes, than has hitherto been done by any previous worker, has been carried out with a view to make a comparative study of the colostrum of these two types of dairy animals. The most striking difference between normal milk and colostrum is in the amount of globulin, a protein that occurs in blood and in traces only in ordinary milk, but is present in colostrum in a comparatively large amount. This globulin content has been found to correspond perfectly with the amount of hemolysins in colostrum [Rogers, 1935] and other workers [Mason, Dalling and Gordon, 1930 and Davies, 1936] have shown that the transmission of antibodies from the mother to the offspring is through the globulin of colostrum and that there is no transmission of maternal antibodies through the placenta. The animals selected for the investigation were from the two important Indian dairy breeds maintained at the Imperial Dairy Institute Farm, Banga- lore, viz., three Sindhi cows and three Murrah buffaloes. Samples of colos- trum were taken immediately after calving, and every six hours for the first day after calving, every twelve hours for the next two days, and after twenty- four hours on the fourth day, by which time the milk was found to have become normal. Samples were drawn from all the four quarters of the udder. ANALYTICAL METHODS The determination of the proteins was carried out by the newer methods of protein analysis suggested by Moir, and adopted by Bergman and Turner [1937] in their analysis of goats' colostrum. (29)
30 Colostrum of the Dairy Cow and the Dairy Buffalo The total protein was precipitated by warm trichloracetic acid, thereby leaving the non-protein nitrogen in solution. After filtering and washing several times with a dilute solution of trichloracetic acid, the filter paper and precipitate were transferred to a Kjeldahl flask, and the nitrogen content was determined by the usual Kjeldahl method. Casein was precipitated by dilute acetic acid buffered with a solution of sodium acetate to maintain the pH at approximately 4.0, which is the pH of casein. The precipitate was filtered and washed with distilled water, and the filter paper with the precipitate was digested in a Kjeldahl flask to estimate the nitrogen content as before. Casein and globulin were precipitated together by the addition of a saturated solution of magnesium sulphate, after first neutralising the sample to phenolphthalein with sodium hydroxide. An additional amount of anhy- drous magnesium sulphate was added to saturate the water in the sample. After the precipitation was complete, the solution was filtered in a pressure filter and the residue was washed with a saturated salt solution. The nitrogen content was determined as for total protein. The amount of albumin was calculated by subtracting casein and globulin from total protein, while the difference between casein and globulin and casein gave the globulin content of the sample. The specific gravity was determined by the Westphal balance at a tem- perature of 20°C. ; acidity and chloride by titrating with sodium hydroxide and silver nitrate respectively ; fat by the Gerber method ; total solids and ash. respectively by evaporating to complete dryness on a water bath, and subsequent ashing of the residue ; and lactose by titrating with the sample, a. 6 per cent copper sulphate solution saturated with a mixture of potassium thioeyanate, sodium carbonate and sodium phosphate in the ratio of 3 : 6: 10 ; 0.4 grm. of lactose reducing 5 c.c. of the solution. TABLE I Composition of the colostrum of Murrah buffaloes V. SIVASUBRAMANIAN AND C. W. DOVER 31 TABLE II Composition of the colostrum of Sindhi cows 32 Colostrum of the Dairy Cow and the Dairy Buffalo The high percentage of total protein in the earliest stages of the colostral period is due mainly to the high globulin content. Buffaloes' colostrum shows a higher content of total protein than cows' colostrum, and in both cases there is a fall which is more rapid during the first twenty-four hours after parturition than the following days. Both casein and albumin behave similarly in that they are present in large amounts at the time of calving, and subsequently show a gradual fall. In these constituents, also buffaloes' colostrum is richer than cows' colostrum. The important part which globulin plays in the transmission of anti- bodies from the mother to her young justifies the separate analysis of this protein, which has not so far been done in previous investigations on the colostrum of bovines. Starting at the high figure of 10.9 per cent in buffaloes and 6.2 per cent in cows, it falls abruptly within the first twenty-four hours by about 75 per cent in the former and 50 per cent in the latter. The rapidity of the subsequent fall, though not as great as in the beginning, is sufficient to result in only traces of this protein fraction being left in the normal milk. SUMMARY 1. Buffaloes' colostrum is higher in specific gravity, acidity, sodium chloride, total solids, total protein, casein, albumin, globulin and ash than cows' colostrum, while in lactose it is lower. 2. In both animals there is a progressive fall in all the constituents except lactose which shows an increase and fat which is irregular. 3. Globulin constitutes the major part of the total protein of both kinds of colostrum soon after calving, and its decrease is more marked during the first twenty-four hours after parturition than during the remainder of the colostral period. 4. Buffaloes' colostrum changes to normal milk in about three days, while cows' colostrum takes about four days. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are grateful to Mr. Zal R.

Absorption took place in the water-bath at 55° C. for 24 hours. The emulsion was centrifuged, and the supernatent serum recovered. This fluid was submitted to two more absorptions in the same manner. The antigens for the agglutination tests with the absorbed serum were made as follows : The selected organisms (see TABLE below) were grown on plain agar slants for 24 hours, at the end of which they were washed in formal- saline.

DETERMINATION OF SEX FROM THE EXTERNAL FEATURES OF LABEO ROHITA, GÜNTHER AND CIRRHINA MRIGALA CUV. AND VAL. BY HIMADRI KUMAR MOOKERJEE, D. Sc. (LOND.), D.I.C. University Professor and Head of the Department of Zoology, University of Calcutta (Received for publication on 31st December 1937) IN connection with the scheme of fresh-water fishes of Bengal which we are tackling in the Zoology Department of the University of Calcutta, and partly financed by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, India, we were in great difficulty in determining the sex of two best food-fishes of Bengal, viz., Labeo rohita and Cirrhina mrigala. On consulting the literature we could not find any record regarding this point on these fishes of India. We made a considerable study on the subject and found the following points which will not only be of immense use to people trained in scientific line, but also will be of equal use to the lay public which is the main idea of the scheme itself. Regarding Labeo rohita it can be said that when the pectoral fin is greater than or equal to anal, it will be a male specimen. When the pectoral fin is less than the anal, it will be a female. In breeding season the area surrounding the vent of the female becomes reddish and swollen. Regarding Cirrhina mrigala, it can be said that when the pectoral fin is greater than the anal, it will be a male specimen like Labeo rohita, but when the pectoral fin is equal to anal, it will be female. The utility of the problem is obvious as one ought to know the sex of the specimens in breeding, rearing and particularly for artificial fecundation.

KRISHNA AYYAR Animal Nutrition Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 2nd September, 1937) IT is well known that, in feeding cattle, in addition to an adequate supply of proteins, fats and carbohydrates, minerals have to be provided in sufficient quantities and in suitable proportions. Of these phosphorus and lime play a very important part. The deficiency of these in the diet is known to cause many diseases. Orr [1929] in his monograph on " Minerals in Pastures, " Crichton [1930] on " Mineral requirements of Dairy Cattle " and Theiler and Green [1931] in their paper on " Aphosphorosis in ruminants " have given copious references to literature on this subject and have recorded many cases where beneficial results have accrued by feeding suitable mineral supple- ments. Work of this nature in India is of recent growth and indications are not wanting that the feeds in many parts of India are definitely deficient in one or more mineral ingredients which may be one of the causes of stunted growth and emaciated appearance of the animals in those areas. Chaudhari [1933] has reported that calves which were stunted in growth, improved consider- ably in weight and condition after being fed a mineral supplement. The present paper is a study of the mineral assimilation of growing calves, especially of calcium and phosphorus under normal conditions of feeding obtained at the Bangalore Dairy Farm. EXPERIMENTAL Eight bull calves, 14 to 17 months old, were selected and divided into two groups of four each in such a way that the average weight and age of the ani- mals in each group remained approximately the same. Group I received the basal ration which consisted of hay, Guinea grass (green), wheat bran and groundnut cake. The quantities of concentrates provided were so adjusted as to admit of a liberal amount of protein for maintenance and growth. This hay was particularly selected as it was known to be poor in phosphoric acid, where the average percentage was only 0.052. Group II received the same (43)
44 Mineral Assimilation of Growing Calves basal ration supplemented by 30 grm. of calcium phosphate, which raised both the calcium and phosphorus content of the ration. The hay was fed ad lib and the daily consumption of each animal was determined accurately. Guinea grass, which was added to meet the vitamin requirements, was given at the rate of one kg. per head per day irrespective of age or weight. The animals were weighed every day and according to the average weight at the end of the week were given increased quantities of concentrate to meet the increased demands of protein due to growth. Before the mineral feeding was commenced, a digestion and mineral balance experiment with all the animals was carried out. (Experiment I). After seventeen weeks, another digestion and mineral balance experiment was carried out (Experiment II) and then the animals were reversed, that is to say, Group I which was getting no mineral now received the mineral supplement and Group II which original- ly received the mineral supplement was deprived of it. The experiment was continued for a further twelve weeks, at the end of which a third digestion and mineral balance experiment was conducted (Experiment III).

A. VISWANATHA IYER AND N. KRISHNA AYYAR 47 From these figures it may be observed that the digestibility during experiment II is, as compared with experiments I & III, slightly lower. This is due to the poor quality of the hay fed during this experiment. Between the two groups, during experiments II & III, the digestibility of the several ingredients remain practically the same. The digestibility of the crude pro- tein of the mineral and no-mineral groups is 67.10 and 67.16 in experiment II and 72.80 and 72.98 in experiment III and this agreement is remarkable, in spite of the fact, that one set of animals in each experiment received an increased quantity of phosphoric acid in the ration.

In the three experiments the different constituents show a positive balance The actual figures are given below :A. VISWANATHA IYER AND N. KRISHNA AYYAR 53 In a previous paper by one of us [Viswanatha Iyer 1935] it was shown that, when other conditions are favourable, certain minimal quantities of both phosphoric acid and lime are to be present before they yield positive balances. In these experiments the intake of both these ingredients are well above those minimal quantities. While no difference in the appearance and the health of the animals be- tween the mineral and no-mineral groups was noticeable, the feeding of calcium phosphate as a supplement to the animals, resulted only in a greater reten- tion of lime and phosphoric acid in their systems. Perhaps this increased retention of lime and phosphoric acid is stored in the skeletal tissue as no additional live-weight increase was noticed corresponding to the increased mineral retention. SUMMARY From this experiment it becomes evident that when the minerals are sufficient in the feed itself, a supplement of calcium phosphate does not show any visible effect except for the fact that the animals receiving the supple- ment retain more calcium and phosphorus in their systems.

CARLING From the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Research Institute in Animal Pathology, Royal Veterinary College, and the Berks and Bucks Joint Sanatorium, Oxon (With 1 Figure in the Text) (Reprinted from The Journal of Hygiene, Vol. 37, No. 2, April, 1937, pp. 243-253.) THE value of pasteurization in destroying pathogenic bacteria in milk and so safeguarding the health of the human population is beyond question. While admitting this, certain workers have hesitated to give their unreserved support to pasteurization on the ground that it may have some deleterious action on the nutritive value of the milk which will more than counteract the beneficial effect resulting from the destruction of harmful micro-organisms. A number of papers have been published in recent years describing attempts that have been made56 Nutritive Value of Raw and Pasteurized Milk (1) from being carried out on too small a number of animals to enable a satisfac- tory result to be obtained, and (2) from being complicated by the occurrence of disease in the experimental animals which may have entirely falsified the outcome of the investigation. In planning an experiment to be carried out on calves, we determined as far as possible to avoid the sources of these errors. Since for financial and other reasons an experiment on really large numbers of animals presented formidable difficulties, it seemed of special importance to make our observations on absolutely healthy animals so that the results might not be influenced in any way by the occurrence of latent or overt disease. DESCRIPTION OF EXPERIMENT With the kind consent of the Committee of the Berks and Bucks Joint Sanatorium, permission was obtained to carry out an experiment on the herd attached to the Sanatorium. The general plan of the experiment, which lasted from July 1934 to September 1936, was to feed alternate calves, as they were born, on raw or pasteurized milk for eight weeks, and to compare their rate of growth. The relevant details may best be considered under separate headings. It may be pointed out at this stage that the management of the herd and the day-to-day control of the experiment was under the personal control of one of the authors (H. F. C.). The Peppard herd.G. S. WILSON, F. C. MINETT AND H. F. CARLING 57 vaccinated the same month with a living vaccine, since when there has not been a single case of abortion. At a herd test carried out some time before the com- mencement of this experiment, no animals showed the presence of specific agglu- tinins in the blood. Johne's disease has seldom occurred; the last animal to be affected with it was in September 1929. The herd has always been relatively free from udder troubles. In October 1936, at the conclusion of the feeding experiment, the milk of each cow was exa- mined culturally by plating in ox-blood agar, with the result that of the eighteen animals present three were found to be affected with streptococcal mastitis in a subclinical form. Pasteurizer.58 Nutritive Value of Raw and Pasteurized Milk pasteurized milk destined for the evening feed, and this appears to have been responsible for a certain amount of scouring in the calves. As soon as the trouble was traced to its source, the practice of leaving the pasteurized milk to cool slowly in the dairy was stopped and the routine described above was enforced. No further difficulty was experienced from scouring, except in a mild form in occa- sional calves. It may be noted that the milk was always produced under cleanly conditions and was of approximately the same standard as Certified milk. Selection of the calves.G. S. WILSON, F. C. MINETT AND H. F. CARLING 59 though more or less adequate for the first few weeks of life, was found to be in- sufficient for the calves as they grew older. The amount was therefore increased, though not to a sufficient extent, as it subsequently proved, to allow of optimal development. The following summarizes the diet received by the different ani- mals : (A) Raw calves 160 Nutritive Value of Raw and Pasteurized Milk in the pasteurized group. At the end of the experiment the average difference in weight between the two groups was 2.09 lb. The average increase in the animals of the raw group was 53.72 lb., and in those of the pasteurized group 53.86 lb. In other words, so far as the average weight gained throughout the whole course of the experiment was concerned, the two groups behaved for all practical purposes identically (Fig. 1). [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Fig. 1. Graph to show weights of all calves after 1-8 weeks. This was all the more remarkable considering the difference in the sex dis- tribution of the animals in the two groups. Male animals usually grow more rapidly than female. This is well shown in the raw group, in which the bull calves put on an average of 6½ lb. more weight than the heifer calves. In the pasteurized group there were approximately twice as many female as male animals and the average increase in weight of both sexes taken together might well have been expected, independent of the nature of the diet, to have been less than that in the raw group in which the sexes were more evenly distributed.

WILSON, F. C. MINETT AND H. F. CARLING 63 TABLE II64 Nutritive Value of Raw and Pasteurized Milk As is to be expected with relatively small numbers of animals, the differences are subject to a certain amount of variation. On the whole the mean increase in weight tended to be slightly higher in the raw than in the pasteurized group during the first month. This was probably due in the main to the depression of the average by one or two animals in the pasteurized group which, as already noted, suffered from scouring during the first two or three weeks of life. In spite of this, the average total increase for the whole experiment was slightly higher for the pasteurized than for the raw animals, the percentage figures being 62.94 and 61.18 respectively. Compared with calves fed on a normal diet, the gains in weight were un- doubtedly low. The amount of milk given, while permitting good skeletal deve- lopment, was insufficient to fatten the animals. Their weight and their market value at the end of eight weeks were, therefore, inferior to those of calves receiving a more generous diet. As soon as their period of experimental observation was over, and the animals that were not to be sold at once were put on to a liberal mixed diet, their weight increased rapidly and within about two to three months equalled that of normally fed animals. Throughout the experiment the general condition of the calves was good. Though lean, they appeared perfectly healthy and showed no sign of rickets, or of symptoms referable to anaemia such as have been noted by several workers who have fed calves on an exclusive diet of raw milk [see Cannon, 1931 ; Knoop et al. 1935]. The slight scouring that occurred in occasional animals after the faulty cooling of the pasteurized milk had been put right, and which was seen in both raw and pasteurized groups, may well have been due to the system of pail- feeding, since it is known that this is liable to give rise to digestive disturbances [Sheehy, 1934]. At no time during the course of the experiment was any lay or professional observer able to distinguish between the two groups of animals. Towards the close of the experiment heifer Rl, which was two years old, was served twice at an interval of three weeks, and heifer P4, which was twenty-two months old, was served once. Both animals are now ' in calf '. DISCUSSION The results, which have been set out in detail, without any reservations, need little discussion. They speak for themselves. That slight variation should occur in the behaviour of different animals in the two groups was inevitable, but there is nothing whatever to suggest that they are attributable to the difference in the nature of the milk received, or that the differences as a whole are significant. In some respects the results are surprising. Each one of us at the commencement of the experiment was not only prepared to find a difference, but actually expected to find a difference, in favour of the animals in the raw group. Moreover, the farm hands who looked after the animals were strongly prejudiced against the
G. S. WILSON, F. C. MINETT AND H. F. CARLING 65 use of pasteurized milk for the feeding of the calves. This prejudice, which affect- ed all of us, in favour of raw milk for calf feeding, was based of course on pure a priori reasoning without any experimental justification. The outcome of the present experiment seems to leave little doubt that, judged by all the criteria we have used, milk produced in a clean manner from healthy animals and submit- ted to low-temperature pasteurization followed by adequate cooling is equal in nutritive value to milk from the same source consumed in the raw condition. It may be noted that Blackwood et al. [1936], who made a careful study of the assimi- lation and retention of nitrogen, phosphorus, and calcium by calves, were like- wise unable to detect any significant difference between raw and low-temperature pasteurized whole milk. Reference should perhaps be made to the work of M'Candlish and Black [1935], which has frequently been quoted as showing that raw milk is of higher nutritive value for calves than pasteurized. Such an interpretation seems to us to be unjustified. It is true that in certain small groups the animals fed on raw milk increased in weight more rapidly than those on pasteurized, but in other groups the reverse was the case. If an analysis is made of the figures relating to all the animals, it is found that the weighted mean increase was actually greater in the pasteurized than in the raw group, the percentages being 311.3 and 308.4 respectively. It is not proposed to enter here into the possible application of this knowledge to practical farming conditions. Suffice it to point out that adequate pasteuriza- tion of milk should prove of considerable value in the rearing of healthy calves in diseased herds. Some success has already been reported from California in the eradication of tuberculosis from dairy herds by this method [see Roadhouse and Perry, 1930]. In deciding whether or not to adopt pasteurization, farmers need no longer be deterred by the fear that calves brought up on pasteurized milk will develop less satisfactorily than those brought up on raw, because of any hypothetical nutritive inferiority of the pasteurized product. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 1. An experiment on the feeding of calves is described, which lasted over two years, and which was carried out on a healthy Shorthorn herd free from tuber- culosis and contagious abortion. 2. Alternate animals as they were born were allocated, without any selection whatever, to one or other of two groups. One of these was fed on raw, the other on pasteurized milk. Every animal received its mother's colostrum for three and a half days before being put on the milk diet. 3. The milk used was taken from the mixed morning's milk of the whole herd. It was divided into two parts, one of which was given raw, the other of K

J. H. RIETZ (J. Amer. Vet. Med. Assn., vol. XC. N. S. vol. 43, No. 2, pp. 163-170, 1937). THE paper was presented at the seventy-third annual meeting of the American Veterinary Medical Association and in the discussion which followed a number of scientists took part. The control of parasites is one of the major problems confronting sheep husband- men throughout the sheep raising areas. The problem is specially acute in enclosed pastures, for the hazards in the life-cycle of the parasite are considerably greater in open-range pastures. The problem of educating the sheep husbandmen in the better methods of control that are devised must be accomplished before, widespread control methods can be adopted. The author carried out experiments at the West Virginia Station on the treatment, proper feeding and management of sheep. In all, he encountered 16 species of para- sites consisting of stomach, nodular, hook and whipworms, tapeworms, lungworms, coccidia and grubs. A total of 162 sheep exclusive of the untreated controls, were used in the series of experiments and were handled in lots of 20 to 30 individuals. The different treatments were administered at intervals of 21 days. Faecal examinations were re- gularly made before, during and after the treatments. On the basis of the results obtained the writer concluded that 1 to 12 per cent solu- tion of calcium polysulphite, when given in doses varying from 1 to 12 ounces after starving the animals for 24 hours, was irritating to the mucous membranes ; was a poor anthelmintic, caused the death of most of the sheep. Tetra chlorethylene, when adminis- tered in 5 c.c. doses to animals prepared by starving for 24 hours, was found to reduce nematode egg counts but not so rapidly as was the case with some other preparations. It did not relieve cestode infestation. Three ounces of 1.5 per cent solution of nicotine sulphate (40 per cent), when given after starving for 24 hours, nauseated most of the sheep but was found to be quite effective in the reduction of nematode ova and cestode infestation. Colloidal iodine (Merck) proved ineffective in the removal of nematode and cestode infestations. After starving the animals for 24 hours, an average of 8.15 and 14 treatments with 3 and 4.5 ounces of one per cent solution of copper sulphate resulted in 71.7 and 50.8 per cent reduction in the nematode ova respectively. The cestodes were not affected. On an average of 7.5 treatments, without any previous fasting, with 4.5 ounces of 1 per cent solution of copper sulphate effected a reduction of 81.1 per cent in nematode ova ; the cestodes remaining unaffected. An average of 14.8 to 7.1 treatments with 3 ounces of 1.5 per cent solution of copper sulphate resulted in a reduction of 76 to 96.6 per cent in nematode ova. In the former case the animals were not starved previously and the cestode infestations were con- trolled only partially, while in the latter case the animals were starved for 24 hours prior to treatment and the cestode infestations were completely controlled. In one of the lots receiving the latter treatment the reduction of nematode ova was 98.7 per cent. (67)
68 ABSTRACTS A mixture of equal parts of 1.5 per cent solutions of copper sulphate and nicotine sul- phate (40 per cent) when administered in doses of 3 ounces resulted in a reduction of 98.2 per cent in nematode ova and a complete control of cestode infestation. An average of seven treatments were given. The untreated control animals in all the lots showed an increase in parasitic in- festations. Mass feeding of copper sulphate in a salt mixture in the ratios of 1 : 30 or 1 : 50 proved not only ineffective but at times dangerous. Finally the author con- cludes that a 1.5 per cent solution of copper sulphate in dosages of 1 ounce or more for lambs and 3 ounces for adults at intervals of three weeks throughout the year, will effectively control the gastro-intestinal parasites. Fasting for 24 hours before treat- ment is essential. The author reports having obtained fair results in the treatment of lungworms with chloroform. He, however, points out that the method is not unattended with danger of losses from pneumonia following anesthesia. About 250 head of sheep suffer- ing from lungworms were treated with an oily solution of pyrethrum, manufactured from 3 pounds of pyrethrum flowers extracted in one gallon of oil. The solution was injected directly into the trachea in doses of 3 to 6 c.c. Only one treatment was re- quired for 70 to 75 per cent of the sheep treated and only 3 to 5 per cent required a third treatment before the larvae disappeared from the faeces. No losses from pneumonia resulted following the use of this solution. Good feeding and management are markedly reflected in the control of parasites of sheep. [H. D. S.] Immunisation Active des Bovidés contre la Fiévre Aphteuse au moyen d'adsor- bats d'aluminium (Active immunization of bovines against foot-and-mouth disease by means of aluminium adsorbates). M. E. TOUSSIENG (Bulletin de l'Office International des Épizootics, xii, 417-444, 1936). THE article records the results of experiments conducted with a view to test if immunity is conferred upon calves that have been vaccinated against foot-and-mouth disease with virus adsorbed on to aluminium, hydroxide. One or the other of the following three strains of viruses was used in the making of the several brews of the experimental vaccine : (a) " Riems O ", an " O " strain obtained from Prof. Waldmann, (b) " Hansen-Fionie ", a strain recovered from a spon- taneous outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the Fionie Island and ascertained to be an " O " strain, and (c) " Virus 2 ", a second " O " strain obtained from Prof. Wald- mann. Some of the brews of vaccine were made each to comprise two portions, the second portion made to contain double the concentration of virus as that contained in the first portion. Calves that were intended for the test of the efficacy of a vaccine were vaccinated twice at ten days' interval with the brew concerned, first with the portion containing the lower concentration of virus and secondly with that containing the higher. Brews made in single strength were used in much larger quantities for the second inoculation.
ABSTRACTS 69 The vaccine was diluted considerably with physiological salt solution before use, and injected subcutaneously, divided between various sites. Samples of sera were taken from the calves after the vaccination and titrated on guinea pigs against foot-and-mouth virus with a view to ascertain the degree of immunity acquired (but this did not give clear cut positive results in most instances, except that generalisation was delayed in some vaccinated cases). After an interval of about three weeks after the second vacci- nation, the calves were tested for immunity by being placed in contact with an arti- ficially infected calf along with a healthy calf for control. If the healthy control calf contracted foot-and-mouth disease and the vaccinated calf remained unattacked, this was taken as evidence of acquired immunity. This was confirmed, in each such case, by submitting the vaccinated calf after an interval of two to three weeks to a further " tongue-test " by inoculation of virus directly into the mucosa of the tongue and upper jaw. As the " Riems O " and " Virus 2 " strains proved to be of insufficient virulence for calves, it was necessary to repeat the immunity tests of calves vaccinated with these strains, against the " Hansen-Fionie " strain which was virulent for bovines. Three types of material were used as the base for the production of the vaccine (i) culture fluid, (ii) extract of aphthous membranes, and (iii) lymph. (i) Culture fluid vaccine.70 ABSTRACTS Three brews of tissue extract vaccine were made. The first and second brews were made from aphthous membranes of calves infected with the " Hansen-Fionie " and the third from aphthous membranes of swine infected with " Virus 2 ". The first vaccine in the third brew was a formalised one. Six calves were vaccinated with the tissue extract vaccine. Two calves vacci- nated with the second brew contracted generalised foot-and-mouth after the first vacci- nation on account of incomplete adsorption of the virus and were of no use for purposes of the experiment. One calf in the first brew had become solidly immune. Of three calves in the third brew two were susceptible by contact and the third developed a sus- picious vesicle but without pyrexia. The latter was found to be immune to the subse- quent " tongue-test ". (iii) Lymph vaccine.ABSTRACTS 71 Of all the existing lines, susceptible and resistant to natural B. enteritidis infection, only susceptible lines 1 and 2, which showed a relatively stable mortality rate of ap- proximately 85 per cent from the outset and resistant lines 1 and 2, which showed a fluctuating mortality rate of about 15 to 20 per cent were retained for further selective breeding and the rest were discarded. Unselected controls showed a relatively stable mortality rate of 37 per cent. Selections for breeding were made as previously, from litters unexposed to infection, thereby insuring against introduction or persistence of the infection in the stock. The method has been to remove the first and often the second litter from the breeding room at 4 to 6 weeks of age and test each with B. enteritidis or virus. If the mortality was maximum or minimum as required, an additional sibling litter was selected and mated brother to sister without testing. First and second litters of the succeeding generations were then tested in the same manner and a third litter chosen for mating. The mouse colony was subjected to continued search for infectious agents. The occasional sickly mouse was sacrificed and tested for the presence of pathogenic bacteria or virus. Faeces from breeders were tested 6 to 12 times a year for mouse typhoid. Selections of mice for breeding had been made entirely on basis of maximum sus- ceptibility or resistance of progeny to B. enteritidis. The susceptible and resistant lines which developed were later found to be susceptible and resistant respectively to Pasteurel- la avicida, B. friedlanderi and pneumococci administered intranasally. Accordingly the former has been designated as bacteria-susceptible (BS) lines and the latter as bacteria- resistant (BR). But, in 1932 and 1933, when it was shown that BS lines were resistant to louping ill virus and BR. lines susceptible, it became necessary to complicate the termi- nology further and to identify the one as bacteria-susceptible-virus-resistant (BSVR) lines and the other as bacteria-resistant-virus-susceptible (BRVS) lines. Finding the mortalities of BSVR lines to louping ill virus averaging about 50 per cent and often concentrated only in certain litters led the author to attempt to develop sub-lines highly resistant to virus (BSVR) and highly susceptible to virus (BSVS) respectively. Parents whose progeny had shown least and greatest mortality following nasal instillation of louping ill virus were selected for further breeding ; all others in these bacteria-susceptible lines were discarded. Subsequent tests were made with St. Louis encephalitis virus. Rigid selection, testing and discarding procedures on approximately 13,200 mice for twelve generations from 1930 to November 1934, resulted in three inbred lines which have shown percentage mortalities to B. enteritidis and virus averaging as follows: BSVS, 95.2 and 86.3 per cent; BSVR, 96.2 and 6.7 per cent; BRVS, 17.3 and 96.6 per cent respectively. High susceptibility proved relatively stable throughout, while high resistance appeared to fluctuate from generation to generation. The susceptible lines showed high mortalities following doses as little as 1/100th of the standard and the resistant lines showed low mortalities following doses 100 times the standard. Conse- quently, the resistant lines, both bacterial and virus, were considered to withstand 1,000 to 10,000 times the dose fatal for susceptibles. The results of the cross-breeding tests support the selective breeding data in indi- cating that resistance to these infections is controlled basically by inherited factors and confirm the previous findings that: (1) the factors are not sex-linked, (2) resistance is dominant over susceptibility,
72 ABSTRACTS (3) the factors regulating resistance to B. enteritidis are not related to those regu- lating resistance to encephalitis virus. and (4) the mechanism of this inheritance may be relatively simple, since the mor- tality percentages in the cross-bred generations approximate for the most part those expected on the basis of two single factor crossings. When BSVR strain was crossed with BRVS, bacteria-resistant-virus-resistant (BRVR) mice were encountered. Hence it was assumed that among these cross-breds, a pure BRVR strain might be present which could be segregated from heterozygous BRVR reactors by selective breeding. Certain lines have thus emerged from this which to date are resistant to both B. enteritidis and virus. All selected lines proved uniformly susceptible to a strain of mouse passage rabies virus, given by natural or artificial routes. [R. L. K.] The problem of grass silage :ABSTRACTS 73 By addition of moderate amounts of mineral acids with or without molasses.74 ABSTRACTS Molasses Process.ABSTRACTS 75 In trying to combat this belief, the author proceeds to explain in the first place, that no sustainable scientific explanation has been advanced in support of telegony. Among the various theories that have been advanced in its favour, critical examination is made of one that is mostly in vogue, namely, the saturation hypothesis. According to this hypothesis the foetus has in its blood special properties derived from the father and on account of the existence of exchange between the maternal and foetal blood, the constitution of the mother may be affected with the result that subsequent offsprings by another father may be influenced. But this conception is directly opposed to the well established chromogenic theory of heredity. In conducting experiments in animal gene- tics with cross breds, particularly with reference to the transmission of a dominant character, it is found that the sex-cells are not influenced by the bodily peculiarities of the animal which lodges them. No more direct evidence is required to show that the bodily peculiarities of an animal do not circulate in its blood in any form. Such being the case- it is all the more unconceivable that the farther removed embryo could have any influence on the sex-cells of its host. Besides, experiments carefully planned to investigate the problem of telegony, under- taken by various workers with a view to reconstruct certain remarkable cases that had seemed to demonstrate the existence of telegony, had always failed to yield positive results. Nevertheless, the fact remains, that certain observations, examples of which have been given above, have appeared to uphold the existence of telegony. The author ex- plains that while these facts are authentic their explanation has been faulty. Their true explanation is to be found in the Mendelian law of heredity. The Mendelian law of heredity shows that there is not always agreement between the external characters of an individual (phenotype), and those which it can transmit to its descendants (genotype). According to circumstance, there is, or there is not, agreement between the phenotype and the genotype. A parent with a long line of ancestors selected for the same attributes shall transmit all these attributes with constancy when it is served with the same stock as itself. In this case the virtues or shortcomings displayed truely correspond to the qualities which it will transmit to its descendants : here there is agree- ment between the phenotype and the genotype. On the contrary, let one take an in- dividual born out of the crossing of two individuals of different races. It is possible that it remarkably resembles one of its parents. Nevertheless one knows that not only it can, but must, certainly transmit to its descendants such attributes that it did not externally display, but which have been held in latency in the sexual cells. In this case there is disagreement between the phenotype and the genotype. It is thus possible sometimes, that bodily peculiarities of an ancestor may sometimes make their appearance in an off- spring removed by several generations. The author quotes as an example the case of the crossing of a grey mouse of pure breed with a white mouse. Greyness being the dominant colour, the young ones will be grey like the grey parent. These grey cross-bred descendants, served between them- selves, will always give a fourth of white mice. This phenomenon is constant. A cross- bred grey mouse, if covered by a white male, will give according to the Mendelian law, half of grey ones and half of white ones. If this same cross-bred grey mouse were served afterwards with a grey cross-bred male, she will give as aforesaid, a fourth of
76 ABSTRACTS white descendants. One who did not know the cross-bred origin of these mice may put this down as due to the influence of the first father. But the same result would have been realised even if the latter mating had taken place first. It is unavoidable. To utilise telegony in order to explain this is, therefore, radically wrong. The author explains that the cases he quoted earlier as examples of those advanced in favour of telegony are again nothing but instances of operation of the ordinary Mendelian law of heredity. With reference to the case of two white swine giving birth to pigmented piglings, the explanation lies in the fact that matings between swine and wild boar are not rare, and that a wild boar should have been used in the past in building up this race of swine. A recent experience of L'ecole d'Alfort is illustrative. Some years ago matings were made between the wild boar and the Large-White swine of the school. Through selection, and elimination of the tainted, a strain was built having all the appearance of a pure race of Large-White. Two of these perfectly white subjects have now given birth to a piglet with wild boar characteristics. With reference to the black Angus bovines without horns giving rise to a roan subject with horns, the author advances a similar explanation. The two Angus parents should have had a horned roan coloured ancestor in the distant past. One knows that the absence of horns and black colour dominate over the presence of horns and roan coloration. It is, therefore, possible that the latter characters have remained latent in some animals as recessive factors. When two such animals accidentally come together, certain of their offsprings get these factors in the duplex condition with the result that the recessive factors become exteriorised. The author explains the case of two furless dogs giving rise to a furred one, as only an expression of the existence of a dominant " lethal character ". Hairless skin in the dog is a lethal character, that is to say, young ones that could have this character in the duplex condition and be genotypically hairless are never born, but suffer death in their embryonic life. The hairless dogs are therefore all cross-breds, and will never breed true but always throw a proportion of furred offspring. This happens invariably without exception. The lethal character is a proven factor in genetics, and the case in question seasily explained thus without having to invoke telegony. It is therefore concluded that telegony is a myth. [V. R.

Journal of the Ministry of Agriculture, 14, 4, July 1937, p. 391). EXPERIMENTS in feeding rats on a diet of milk and white flour at the National Insti- tute for Research in Dairying, have shown that both raw and pasteurised milks could sustain life whereas sterilized milk could not do so. No difference could be detected between raw milk and commercially pasteurised milk by the holding method, either in the digestibility and biological value of the protein or in the availability of the calcium and phosphorus and the former did not prove inferior to the latter when used as an ex- clusive diet supplemented by iron, copper and. manganese. The conclusions arrived at by the Milk Production Department of the West of Scotland Agricultural College, after feeding trials with 35 dairy calves, are of much importance in calf rearing. The calves were divided into different groups of winter heifers and winter bulls to be tried for 150 days and summer heifers and summer bulls to be tried for 120 days. Colostrum of the dam was fed to 4 groups for 5 days and to the rest for 10 days after which raw or milk pasteurised by heating at 145-150°F for 30 minutes were fed at the rate of 1 lb. per 10 lb. live-weight until a maximum daily allowance of 15 lb. was reached. After the third week the calves had free access to good hay and an allowance of concentrates. The winter bull calves on raw milk and those on pasteurised milk after 5 days colostrum feeding showed an increase of 364 and 330 per cent respectively of their live-weight at birth in 150 days. The spring bull calves fed on raw milk and pasteurised milk after 5 days of colostrum feeding showed an increase of 272 and 244 per cent respectively of their live-weight at birth in 120 days. The heifer calves fed on pasteurised milk after 10 days of colostrum feeding and those after 5 days of colostrum feeding, took 2 months and 4 months respectively to overtake the heifer calves fed on raw milk and at the end of the first year the heifers on raw milk had made a live-weight gain of 590 per cent while those on pasteurised milk after 10 days colostrum had gained 554 per cent. Thus very, small superiority of raw milk over pasteurised milk is observed. But the calves on raw milk were observed to have better coats and incidence of diseases also seemed to be less for the group, it being the heavier the shorter the initial period on colostrum. More extensive experiments on a larger number of calves are necessary before definite conclusions are arrived at. [H. L.]

All manuscripts should be clean, clear and carefully revised. Only one side of the paper should be used, and as far as practicable the original type- written copy and not a carbon copy should be sent. Capitals should be sparingly used, and all the necessary punctuations should be done in the MS. and not left for introduction in proofs. 2. The title of a paper should not be lengthy. 3. It is desirable that MS. should have suitable heads and sub-heads. In numbering the principal divisions of a paper Roman numerals should be used. The use of Arabic figures and (a), (b), (c), etc., is generally reserved for number- ing the sub-divisions coming under each head. 4. Articles submitted for publication either in the Indian Journal of Agricul- tural Science or in the Indian Journal of Veterinary Science and Animal Hus- bandry should be accompanied by abstracts for publication in Agriculture and Live-stock in India. Abstracts should be concise, but should be long enough to explain the matter dealt with ; ordinarily no abstract should exceed 200 words. 5. When a word or line is intended to be printed in italics it should be under- lined with a single line, in SM. CAP. with two lines, in CAPITALS with three lines, and when in Antique (heavy type) with a wavy line (-----------------------). 6. In descriptive matter, numbers under 100 and all numbers occurring at the beginning of a sentence should be in words. 7. Local names for crops, technical operations, etc., should be defined where they first occur in the text, e.g., rabi (spring crop). The use of local weights and measures should be avoided as far as possible. Vernacular names, such as jowar, bajri, should be in italics without a capital letter, and each such name where it first occurs should be followed by its scientific equivalent in brackets, e.g., jowar (Andropogon Sorghum). It is usual to write the initial letters of varietal names in capitals, e.g., Striped Mauritius, Dharwar-American cotton and Broach cotton. 8.

GIPDORIGINAL ARTICLES THE INTER-RELATIVITY OF THE DISEASES OF ANIMALS AND MAN* BY PROF. SIR FREDERICK HOBDAY, C.M.G., F.R.C.V.S., F.R.S.E., DR. MED. VET. (H. C.) ZURICH. Honorary Veterinary Surgeon to H. M. the King Emperor and Lecturer on Comparative Medicine at St. George's Hospital Medical School. Editor of the Veterinary Journal. (Received for publication on 2nd February, 1938) IN India as well as in England there are certain diseases of animals and man which are of mutual interest to the medical man and the veterinarian, either on account of their analogies or their differences; or by reason of the fact that they are contagious from animals to man or vice versa, and it is not wise for either branch of medicine, nor yet for our mutual patients, to work in watertight compartments. It is better from every point of view that we work in collaboration. Some diseases, such as cancer, tuberculosis, anthrax, and tetanus we attack respectively in somewhat different ways ; whilst others, such as glanders, rabies, foot-and-mouth disease, mange, and ringworm can only be effectively dealt with by definite collaboration between medical men and veterinarians. There are others in which as yet there has been no effectual attempt at collaboration. Such ailments as common catarrh and the influenzas can be dealt with to mutual advantage from a com- parative aspect, as can more complicated ailments such as Hodgkin's disease, and such common ailments as rheumatism and fibrositis. An exchange of ideas as to the symptoms, methods of spread, etc., in our various patients is of undoubted help towards elucidation. In veterinary medicine, equally with the human side, the study of collateral branches of science, such as entomology or parasitology, is of material help, and in teaching colleges, as in hospitals, a knowledge of the life-histories of the various flies and insects which act as carriers or transmitters of parasites is as essential to the vete- rinary student as to his medical confrére. In the clinical world, too, we have many points in common, for our animal patients suffer from gastritis, indiges- tion, colic, internal parasites, colitis, swallowing of foreign bodies, and various forms of pneumonia and heart disease, to the same extent as human patients do, and our veterinary treatments are similar in principle to those in human practice. The veterinarian has, however, a greater variety of internal arrange- ments to deal with, having to take into account whether his patient is * Paper presented to the Indian Science Congress, Calcutta, January, 1938.

92 Inter-relativity of the Diseases of Animals and Man herbivorous or carnivorous ; or whether, as is the case in man, it will eat anything and everything which it has an opportunity of eating. Some of our patients have only one stomach, whereas others have fourF. HOBDAY 93 of the British Army, and it has been applied so successfully in Great Britain that at the present time the disease has absolutely ceased to exist. This means that not only has it been eliminated from the list of ailments which the veteri- nary surgeon is called upon to diagnose, but it has also been eliminated from the list of diseases in man ; and in an island country like Great Britain, so long as the present regulations of the Veterinary Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries are kept in operation, the country will be free from this terrible affection. In India I understand that it is still a problem to be dealt with, but of this I hope to hear something in the discussion. RABIES This disease has not been met with in man in England for more than thirty years, and it can never appear again as an epidemic in this country so long as control is kept upon the importation of animals of the dog and cat tribe. The primary cause of rabies in man is the contact of an abraded sur- face of the body with the saliva of a rabid animal, and whether the infected animal is a horse, a sheep, or any other animal, it has always had its primary origin in a rabid dog and cat. The Muzzling Order succeeded in eradicating the disease from Great Britain, and it then remained for the Veterinary Advisers to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to take steps to see that it was not re-introduced into the country. This explains the present quarantine regulations imposed on all dogs and cats admitted from countries where rabies exists. The absence of the disease is further proof of the value of the collaboration between the forces of the veterinarian and the medical man in the cause of Public Health. In India you are much more heavily handicapped than we are in. England, especially on account of the numbers of pariah dogs, over which, I understand, it is difficult to obtain control. ANTHRAX This condition is much more prevalent in India than in England, and is particularly met with in cattle, horses, sheep and pigs; the dog, cat and fowl possessing a comparatively high power of resistance to the infection. It is a disease which is always serious and, in animals, invariably results in death. In cattle, especially, death is very sudden, and in Great Britain the Government has imposed laws and regulations which provide that the body must be cre- mated as near as possible to the place where the animal died. It is forbidden, too, in any way to cut the carcase, for on many occasions these making,. or assisting at, the post mortem have become infected and have died in conse- quence. In cities and towns in England where wool from foreign countries is handled, disinfection is compulsorily adopted, with satisfactory results. If this practice could also be efficiently adopted in the case of hides, bone manure and other animal products, before they are imported into this country, the number of deaths from anthrax in man and animal would diminish con- siderably. Cotton, linseed, and other cattle-food cakes come into the same
94 Inter-relativity of the Diseases of Animals and Man category. Once eradicate anthrax from the animal and animal products and eradication from man would automatically follow. Anthrax is primarily a disease for the Veterinary Surgeon, as it always originates from some pro- ducts obtainedF. HOBDAY 95 In India it is always more or less with you but in a much milder form than we get it in Europe, and the conditions do not necessitate the same drastic treatment nor would such be possible. TUBERCULOSIS This is pre-eminently a disease which illustrates the value of collaboration between the medical man and the veterinarian in the cause of Public Health. No variety of domesticated animal is immune to tuberculosis, although some are more susceptible than others. The goat, the sheep, and the horse, are probably the least affected, but even in these it is only a question of degree and there is no actual immunity when they are placed under conditions favourable for infection. Birds, especially poultry, are frequently affected and whenever the disease appears amongst them the whole flock may have to be destroyed before it is eradicated. It is a disease which the practising veterinarian meets with most com- monly in cattle, and there are about a. million tuberculous cattle in Great Britain at the present time. These are not all dairy cattle, but it is in these that the danger lies for man, as. it is well known that at least 40 per cent96 Inter-relativity of the Diseases of Animals and Man for one can never tell exactly when the udder tissues will become infected; and the milk a source of definite and terrible danger to the children to whom it is given. Pasteurization, undoubtedly, offers some safeguard, but it is generally admitted that some of the valuable properties which raw milk possesses are lost during this process, and there can be no doubt that the best solution of the prevention of infection lies in the endeavour to obtain an absence of the tubercle bacilli at the source of supplyF. HOBDAY 97 is now extraordinarily small. It is, however, to the domestic pets, especial- ly the dog and cat, that attention should be drawn, for it is quite an easy matter for a pet dog to transmit the parasite of mange from itself to its owner. An itchy dog should, therefore, always be regarded with suspicion, and the pernicious habit of allowing a dog to sleep in bed with a human being should be emphatically discouraged. A dog with mange, especially in hot weather, or when its body becomes heated by lying in front of the fire (or sleeping on an eider-down or blanket), will be continually scratching, especially in the region of the arm-pits and under the thighs, where the body is hot and the hair is thin. If no treatment is adopted, the dog will break out in sores, the hair will fall off, and the animal will presently smell very offensively and become covered with scabs. If allowed to come into contact with any part of the human body for more than a few minutes, it is quite an easy matter for the parasite to transfer itself to its human host, and it may remain for a considera- able number of days, or even weeks, until it has finished its life-history. During this time it will give rise to a great deal of irritation and discomfort, which could easily have been prevented had the owner of the dog sought veteri- nary advice. There are numbers of other diseases in which it is of value to the Public Health Service that, in the fight for their eradication, the human physician and the veterinarian should collaborate, for the patients of each are equally attacked. Cancer may be taken as a type. This dreaded disease is recognis- ed in such veterinary patients as horses, cattle, dogs, cats and even fish, and many of the theories which research workers form, if their observations are concentrated on man alone, may at once be seen to be erroneous upon comparing notes with veterinary pathologists, whose lives bring them in con- tact with the comparative aspect. In foreign countries this has been for a long time recognised, and their governments have granted liberal funds for research into the problems of animal diseases and their relation to Public Health, finding it a paying proposition98 Inter-relativity of the Diseases of Animals and Man In connection with milk, too, as a food product one must not forget to draw attention to its danger as a carrier of disease in such diseases as scarlet fever and diphtheria of man. In conclusion, I hope that you will agree that I have introduced suffi- cient framework in the brief time at my disposal to illustrate the importance of consideration of the important relationship existing between the diseases of animals and man.
BABESIA BOVIS STARCOVICI, 1893, AS THE CAUSE OF RED-WATER IN AN INDIAN BUFFALO* BY J. A. IDNANI, G.B.V.C. Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar. (Received for publication on 13th December 1937) (With Plate III) THE purpose of this article is to record, for the first time in India, the occurrence of Babesia bovis Starcovici, 1893, in the blood of a buffalo. Bovine red-water in this country implies the invasion of red cells of the blood with Babesia bigemina [Smith and Kilbourne, 1893] which is so wide- spread that indigenous cattle, being in a state of ' Carrier' immunity, generally bear the effects caused by this parasite with impunity. Babesia bigemina, as it occurs in India, has always been observed to conform with the usual morphological picture ascribed to it in literature from other parts of the world. It is fairly large in size, the dimensions generally conforming with those described originally by Smith and Kilbourne [1893] and subsequently by other systematists [Wenyon, 1926], viz., 2 µ to 4 µ in length and 1.5 µ to 2 µ in width at the broadest part. It usually occurs in double pear-shaped forms which converge at their pointed ends forming a very acute angle, with the result that the bulbous ends lie fairly closely to- gether. The parasite almost always occupies the centre of the red cell and consists of a cytoplasm easily stained with basic dyes, and of a fairly big chromatin mass staining deeply with acid dyes. It is not quite uncommon for one, specially in those cases where an active multiplication of the para- site is going on, to come across a number of red blood cells invaded by a variety of forms resulting from the amoeboid activities of the parasite. In such cases the form most commonly met with is that where the parasite is observed to be almost circular, the cytoplasm appearing to be condensed towards the periphery with quite a big clear central area. The clinical manifestations (fever, haemoglobinuria) caused by the acute effects of the parasite can usually be relieved by one or two injections of a suitable dose of the dye, trypanblue, which is extensively employed against infection with B. bigemina. Cattle in this country commonly harbour another variety of piroplasm, viz., Theileria mutans, which is of an even more widespread occurrence than B. bigemina. The morphological features of this parasite, however, are too familiar to give rise to any confusion between these two different families of Piroplasmidea. * Paper read at the Indian Science Congress held at Calcutta, January, 1938.

100 Red-water in an Indian Buffalo HISTORY OF THE CASE UNDER REPORT The parasite which is the subject of the present article was encountered in the blood smears from an indigenous buffalo, Sita, of the Military Dairy Farm, Belgaum, which were forwarded to this Institute on 7th August, 1936, for microscopical examination with the following history :PLATE III [ Ind. Jour. Vety. Sci. & Anim. Husb., Vol. VIII, Pt. II [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Babesia bovis. × 1600
J. A. IDNANI 101 worthy of note that the buffalo in question was housed alongside some Euro- pean cattle at the Belgaum Dairy Farm. It may be mentioned that an attempt was made to transmit the disease in buffaloes and hill bulls with the blood obtained from the infected buffalo but this failed. This failure may be attributed to the haemolysed and de- composed state in which the sample of infective blood employed in the trans- mission experiment was received. The annexed camera lucida drawing (Plate III) represents the morphological characters of most of the Babesia parasites as seen in the blood smears from the Belgaum buffalo. SUMMARY (1) Babesia bigemina has been the only parasite so far known to cause bovine red-water in India. (2) The paper records the occurrence in an indigenous buffalo, of another species of Babesia. (3) The parasite is observed to be different from Babesia bigemina, but resembling Babesia bovis. REFERENCES MacFadyean, J. and Stockman, S. (1911).

DURATION OF IMMUNITY FOLLOWING GOAT-VIRUS VACCINATION IN CATTLE* BY R. N. NAIK, G.B.V.C. Veterinary Investigation Officer, Bombay Presidency, Bombay (Received for publication on 9th January, 1938) (With six text-figures) GOAT-ADAPTED-RINDERPEST-VIRUS was first given a trial on a batch of twenty animals on 17th September 1932, in this presidency, with a view to use it as a prophylactic agent against rinderpest which was responsible in causing, on the average, 11,369 deaths among cattle every year. This experi- ment proved a success inasmuch as the reaction produced was mild and there were no deaths among the vaccinated animals. Being encouraged by these results, further experiments were undertaken on a larger number of animals with the same results as obtained in the first experiment. It was then considered that this method of preventive inoculations should be given a thorough trial in clean and affected villages and in all available breeds of oxen and buffaloes in different tracts of the presidency. Accordingly, care- fully devised experiments were carried out for a period of four years, during the course of which 14,807 animals were subjected to the vaccination opera- tion. The results obtained proved that this vaccination was the cheapest, efficient, safe and suitable method of prophylaxis which is available to afford active immunity in cattle and to cut short rinderpest outbreaks under rural conditions in this country. Basing on these findings, preventive inoculation with anti-rinderpest serum, which was affording protection only for nine days, was totally discarded ; a depot for the production of goat-virus was organised in the Bombay Veterinary College and goat-virus vaccination has now been resorted to in the Bombay Presidency, thus making a substantial ad- vance in the method of controlling the fell disease. The next step in this connection to pursue was to ascertain the duration of immunity conferred by this vaccination. Immunity experiments were, therefore, systematically carried out on vaccinated animals at progressive intervals during previous years with the result that the vaccinated animals were found possessing solid immunity up to four years (Annual Administra- tion Reports of the Veterinary Investigation Officer, Bombay Presidency, Bombay, for the years 1933-34, 1934-35, 1935-36 and 1936-37). Now, with a view to study the subject further a fresh immunity experiment was under- taken and this report deals with the same. * Paper read at the Indian Science Congress, Calcutta, 1938. (103)

112 Goat-Virus Vaccination in Cattle It is observed from Table I that both oxen and buffaloes failed to con- tract rinderpest even after artificially infected with a massive dose of virulent virus ; pregnant animals showed no signs of ill-health to the foetus in utero, and the buffalo-cow in milk continued to yield normal quantity of milk. The two control bulls, on the other hand, developed rinderpest and as a sequel, there was resuscitation of B. bigeminum in one and of T. mutans in the other. The bull which had the complication of B. bigeminium was, at one time, con- sidered likely to succumb on account of bloody urine it passed and the pre- sence of a teaming number of the protozoa in the peripheral blood-film. But it made a spontaneous recovery along with its companion without any treat- ment. SUMMARY Four cattle which were vaccinated with goat-blood-virus five years ago were artificially infected with virulent rinderpest-virus with the result that every animal was found to possess solid immunity against rinderpest, thus showing that the duration of immunity conferred by goat-blood-virus vacci- nation is more than five years.

HELMINTHOLOGY IN RELATION TO VETERINARY SCIENCE BY HAR DAYAL SRIVASTAVA, M.Sc. Officiating Helminthologist, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar. (Received for publication on 7th October 1937) THE study of parasitic worms is technically known as Helminthology. Veterinary helminthology aims at the conservation of public and animal health. For a long time stockowners sincerely questioned the importance of worms and denied that they ever did any appreciable damage. They were inclined to attribute the losses due to worms to other causes as the common symptoms of helminthiasis114 Helminthology in Relation to Veterinary Science impossibility. Further, he pointed out that the annual heavy losses from the actual deaths of the parasitised represented only a very small fraction of the damage suffered from loss of condition and reduced productivity. Helminths cause damage to the host in any one or more of the following ways:H. D. SRIVASTAVA 115 sheep and goats is Haemonchus contortus and in cattle Mecistocirrus digitatus. Fourie [1931] compared the anaemias of haemonchosis in sheep to that caused by daily withdrawal of blood from the jugular vein and found the two anaemias to be haematologically identical. In 1934, Martin and Ross attempted to estimate the amount of blood withdrawn by Haemonchus contortus from the amount of phosphorus eliminated with the eggs of the worms. It was found that even in moderate infestations about 30 c.c. of blood was used daily by the worms. This is the minimal figure and probably the actual amount would be several times more. Apart from the larvae of certain roundworms which pass through the lungs during their course of migration in the body, there are several worms which have their final habitat in the lungs, and produce marked pul- monary symptoms. Lungworms are specially dangerous in calves, sheep and goats. Another worm which is particularly dangerous to young animals is the ascarid parasite of calves and foals. Though, in the adult stage, amphis- tomes are practically harmless, they are highly pathogenic in their immature stages which are passed in the duodenum and intestine. The immature stages of amphistomes, specially of Cotylophoron cotylophorum, are often responsible for alarming symptoms, such as persistent foetid diarrhoea, oedema of the submaxillary space, intestinal haemorrhage and general unthriftiness, etc., and consequent high mortality. Recently, two other important diseases of bovines have been found to be due to helminths. They are nasal schistoso- miasis and cutaneous microfilariasis. Besides the above, whipworms, intestinal nodule worms and tapeworms are often responsible for much damage to ruminants. POULTRY Helminths do considerable damage to poultry. Instances are not rare when most of the birds in a flock are lost as a result of worm infestations. The most harmful trematode of poultry is the one116 Helminthology in Relation to Veterinary Science times may become large enough to cause mechanical interference and obstruc- tion to the passage of food. The gizzard may be weakened to such an extent that a rupture may result. Stomach worms are reported to produce toxins as well. CANINES Amongst the important helminth parasites of the dog may be mentioned hookworms, tapeworms, ascarids, liver and lungflukes and Spirocerca sangui- nolenta. Ancylostomiasis is probably the most important of all the helminthic diseases of the dog. Its chief symptom is anaemia due to loss of blood. Wells [1931] was able to observe living hookworms feeding on the mucous membrane in a loop of the small intestine of an anaesthetised dog. He observ- ed that the hookworm fills the intestine with blood and ejects it through the anus at intervals varying from a few seconds to fifteen minutes. He com- puted that the quantity of blood removed by a single worm in 24 hours amounted to 0.85 c. c. In a heavy infestation the dog may harbour several hundreds of worms and consequently lose a large quantity of its blood daily. Besides the helminths which infest domestic animals exclusively, there are a large number of worms which are common to man and animals either in their adult or larval stages. In such cases animals usually serve as the reser- voir hosts. All such worms are important from a public health point of view and may be considered under three main heads :H. D. SRIVASTAVA 117 Trichinella spiralis. The infestation is acquired by eating raw or improperly cooked pork containing the encysted larvae. Heavy infestations are often fatal. C. PARASITES WHICH LIVE AS ADULTS IN MAN AND AS ADULTS IN ANIMALS The most important disease under this group is the well-known ' Hydatid ' caused by the bladder worm stage of Echinococcus granulosus of dogs, cats and wild canidae. The intermediate hosts of this tapeworm are legion, almost any mammal. There are a large number of trematodes of birds and mammals, the cercariae of which actively penetrate into the skin and produce a marked local reaction known as cercarial dermatitis. Analogous to this is the condi- tion known as ' Creeping eruptions ' which is caused by a variety of parasites of lower animals penetrating into the skin of man and finding the environment unsuitable, move about in or under the skin. The commonest of such parasites is the immature hookworm of dogs and cats. Apart from the parasites which are injurious to man in one way or other, there are several which by their presence render meat unfit for human con- sumption, e.g., liverflukes, tapeworms, hydatid cysts, kidney worm and Onchocerca sp. in muscles, etc. Though there are at present no statistics to show the actual economic loss due to helminths in this country, few will deny the importance of helminths as factors determining the health of stock. The problems of veterinary hel- minthology are highly complex. These parasites are highly specialised and have acquired a high degree of adaptation to their peculiar modes of life. The relations existing between them and their hosts are in all respects governed by their life-history. A detailed knowledge of their life-histories is necessary to determine the nature and extent of the pathological conditions to which they give rise or to devise means of protection against them. As development of science makes it possible to keep more and still more animals on a limited area, so also does it make an increase in the number of their para- sites possible. Unless helminth parasites are studied systematically and thoroughly, the list of obscure and undiagnosed diseases, puzzling anaemias and mysterious enlargement of organs will remain lengthy and will continue to be a stumbling block in the conservation of animal health in this country.

ESTIMATION OF TOTAL SULPHATE IN BLOOD SERUM BY N. C. DAS GUPTA Animal Nutrition Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar. (Received for publication on 11th April 1938) TOTAL sulphates are usually estimated by hydrolysing the substance and precipitating the sulphates as barium or benzidine salts. The nephelometric method of Denis and Reed [1926-1927] suffers from the disadvantage that the turbidity of the suspension of barium sulphate is dependent on changes in the pH. and composition of the blood filtrate. Wakefield [1929] hydrolysed blood filtrate with hydrochloric acid and estimated the sulphates as benzidine sulphate. He used two drops of concen- trated hydrochloric acid to 5 c.c. of blood filtrate and kept the tube in boiling water for fifteen minutes. It was allowed to cool and benzidine solution was then added. The present author has found that with blood serum of cattle, the concentration of acid used and the time allowed for hydrolysis are not sufficient for complete hydrolysis. The hydrochloric acid present is also partly precipitat- ed as benzidine chloride, which being insoluble in acetone cannot be removed by washing. Fiske [1921] studied the difficulties which are encountered when benzidine is used to separate sulphate quantitatively from other inorganic compounds such as phosphates and chlorides. Hubbard [1930] also mentioned about the interference of benzidine chloride when sulphate was precipitated in the hydrolysed liquid. The present work was started to find out a method of avoiding these difficulties and to work out a suitable technique for the estimation of total sulphates in blood serum. 1.

S per cent, that is more than double the quantity present in the sample. The higher results in both the samples B and C were due to the separation of benzidine salts of phosphoric acid on account of insufficient acid. High concentration of acid tended to hold benzidine sulphate in solution and low ones to permit the precipitation of phosphates. With samples of normal phosphorus content (5 mg. inorganic phosphorus per cent) one per cent acid might be sufficient in certain cases to keep the phosphates present in solution, but with samples of abnormally high phosphorus content it was safer to use three per cent acid. The following observations in Table V confirm the results obtained in Table IV :124 Estimation of Total Sulphate in Blood Serum added to serum filtrate, which were then estimated as usual. Blank determina- tions on the serum filtrate alone were made simultaneously. The results obtained are given in Table VI. TABLE VI N. C. DAS GUPTA 125 2. The hydrochloric acid which usually interferes with the estimation of total sulphates is removed by vacuum evaporation. 3. The optimum acidity required for the quantitative precipitation of sulphates and for keeping the phosphates in solution has also been studied. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The author is grateful to Dr. F. J.

DIPETALONEMA DRACUNCULOIDES (COBBOLD, 1870) BY M. ANANT NARAYAN RAO, G.M.V.C. Lecturer in Parasitology, Madras Veterinary College (Received for publication on 30th March 1938) [With three text-figures] THE presence of Dirofilaria repens Railliet and Henry [1911] in the subcuta- neous tissue of dogs in Bihar and Orissa has been recorded by Panda [1932] and Dirofilaria immitis [Leidy, 1856] has been recorded in indigenous dogs in South Bengal by Mitter [1912]. As regards D. immitis, it would appear from the references cited by Bhalerao [1935], that in other places in India, it has been recorded only in imported dogs particularly from Burma and Federa- ted Malay States. Hence Mitter's finding of D. immitis in indigenous dogs of South Bengal may require confirmation. So far as Madras Presidency is concerned, these two species of worms have not been found in indigenous dogs hitherto. The embryos of these two species, however, are found in the circulating blood. Rao [1923] and Korke [1924] described Haematozoon lewisi (Filaria re- condita Grassi) and Microfilaria lewisi, respectively, in the circulating blood of dogs, but neither of them could find any adult filarid worms in the blood vessels and other organs at post mortem examination. No worker in India has so far recorded Dipetalonema dracunculoides [Cobbold, 1870] in dogs. The present opportunity is, therefore, taken to record its presence in this country. The embryos of this species are found in the circulating blood and resemble very closely the microfilariae described by Rao [1923]. The description of Microfilaria lewisi given by Korke [1924] conforms to that of D. dracuncu- loides. Korke himself admits this fact and further adds that it is probable that the microfilariae so frequently observed by Lewis in Calcutta (and whose measurements as mentioned by Mitter [1912] were shorter than those of the embryos of D. immitis) are identical with Microfilaria lewisi. It is, therefore, apparent that both Rao and Korke described the same species of microfilariae which are actually the embryos of D. dracunculoides, and this is confirmed by the finding of the adult worms in the peritoneal cavity of an indigenous dog of the Rajapalayam breed of South India. The author obtained 18 males and 43 female worms from that dog.

POTERIOSTOMUM RATZI (KOTLAN, 1919) BY M. ANANT NARAYAN RAO, G.M.V.C. Lecturer in Parasitology, Madras Veterinary College (Received for publication on 30th March 1938) [With two text-figures] ON examination of a collection of Trichonema obtained last year, two species of Poteriostomum were found, viz., P. imparidentatum [Quiel, 1919] and P. ratzi [Kotlan, 1919]. The former has been reported from the Punjab and United Provinces [Bhalerao, 1935]. The latter species has not been recorded hitherto in horses in India, and a brief description of it is given below. The infestation with these worms seems to be small and the writer found about six of the former and four of the latter species in the large intestines of two different hackney ponies in Madras. No dimensions of the worms are noted since there were only three males and one female available for study, and only the male worm is described below for obvious reasons.

(LOND.), D.I.C. Offg. Entomologist, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on 18th April 1938) INTRODUCTION A PERUSAL of the literature reveals that comparatively little work has been done to compile a check-list and host-list of the Ixodoidea (ticks), a highly interesting group of Arthropoda, many of which are of immense impor- tance to human economy as being responsible for the transmission of various diseases amongst men and domesticated animals. The Ixodidae occurring in this country have been very ably listed by Sharif [1928] who recorded altogether nine genera and forty-five species, four sub-species and six varieties, but the only reliable account of the Arga- sidae has been given by Nuttall, Warburton, Cooper and Robinson [1908- 1926]. Since these publications, additional records have accumulated and it is felt that the data such as that given in the present paper concerning the distribution and hosts of the ticks (both Argasidae and Ixodidae) are worth publishing for ready reference of interested workers. Almost all the new records that have come to light as a result of the present study are based on collections of the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute at Mukteswar (India), and the ticks dealt with were for the most part already determined by Warburton, Sharif and Sen (S. K.), excepting a few specimens examined by the author. In arranging the species in the text, only the original references to the ticks concerned, together with the reference of either Nuttall et al " A Monograph of Ixodoidea " in case of the Argasidae, or Sharif's paper " A Revi- sion of the Indian Ixodidae with special reference to the Collection in the Indian Museum " in case of the Ixodidae are given. The species of the various Indian ticks that are represented in the collection of the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute at Mukteswar are marked with asterisks (*) in the host- parasite list appended. In discussing the distribution and hosts of the Ixo- doidea only the records of the strictly Indian territories have been taken into consideration. (133)

SELECTED ARTICLE SCHISTOSOMES AND SCHISTOSOMIASIS IN INDIA BY G. D. BHALERAO, D.Sc., PH.D. (LOND.), F.Z.S., F.R.M.S., F.A.Sc. Helminthologist, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar. [Reprinted from the " Papers on Helminthology published in commemoration of 30- year Jubileum of the Scientific, Educational and Social activities of the Honoured Worker of Science K. J. Skrjabin, M. Ac. Sci., and of Fifteenth Anniversary of the All-Union Institute of Helminthology" published by the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Science, Moscow]. ALTHOUGH fortunately schistosomiasis has not much significance in re- gard to the welfare of mankind in India, it has assumed paramount impor- tance in connection with the health of domestic animals in this country. Compared with any other single group of parasites, schistosomes rank fore- most in undermining the health of various of our domestic animals, and al- though the exact data in this connection are not available it will not be an exaggeration to say that they cause much inconvenience and harm to live- stock in India, and inflict considerable monetary loss upon stock-owners in this country. In spite of this enormous loss, no thorough attempt has yet been made to bring together in a comprehensive manner all the maladies of domestic animals in which schistosomes are incriminated. We cannot, how- ever, deny credit in this direction to Montgomery who, working at this Insti- tute, published as early as 1906 two very comprehensive papers dealing with schistosomiasis of equines, cattle and sheep and discovered three new species of schistosomes. Since this pioneer work of Montgomery, there have appeared in this country, particularly in the last decade and a half, several valuable papers dealing with this group of parasites in relation either to do- mestic animals or human beings, and the present opportunity is, therefore, availed of to give a short résumé of all the work done in this country on this economically highly important group of parasites. The earliest record of the occurrence of schistosomes in India was made by Cobbold, who in 1882, at a meeting of the Medical Chirurgical Society in London, declared that cattle and sheep in India are infected with schisto- somes. Four years after this statement, Bomford reported the occurrence of Schistosoma haematobium eggs in the large intestine of two bullocks of the Transport Department destroyed in Calcutta. The dimensions of the egg were 0.17 mm. × 0.08 mm. S. haematobium has never been since recorded from cattle in this country and for this reason it is thought that the eggs (149)
150 Schistosomes and Schistosomiasis in India which. Bomford observed in 1886 were those of Schistosoma indicum. The dimensions of the egg also corroborate this suggestion. This was followed by a long interval of two decades which was noteworthy for the absence of any records of schistosomes of domestic animals in this country. In 1906 appeared two memorable contributions from this Institute by Mont- gomery who described Orinthobilharzia bomfordi and Schistosoma spindalis from the portal circulation of cattle and S. indicum from that of the horse, donkey and sheep. Montgomery described all the symptoms and the patho- logical changes brought about by these worms in their respective hosts. He also recorded S. bovis from sheep in Bareilly and Lahore districts. He was of the opinion that S. bovis set up no pathological changes in sheep, but in the infection of sheep with S. indicum the alimentary canal from the pylorus to the margin of the anus is studded with small areas of distinct punctiform haemorrhages. Our recent observations at this Institute in the latter res- pect are in keeping with those of Montgomery. In some areas in this country, particularly Sind, Punjab, Assam and Bihar, there exists a condition of ovines known locally as gillar or phet characterised by persistent diarrhoea and oedematous swelling about the face. Examination of portions of intes- tine of sheep suffering from this disease received from Karachi revealed that the entire intestinal canal was studded with nodules which contained Schisto- soma indicum worms and their ova. Baldrey's observations in 1906 at Lahore also corroborated this fact. It has already been remarked that Montgomery described S. indicum and S. spindalis, and Bhalerao [1932] published more important data regard- ing the structure and the variations occurring in these worms. Liston and Soparkar in 1918 worked out the life-cycle of S. spindalis by artificially infect- ing a kid with the furcocerous cercaria liberated by the snail, Indoplanorbis exustus and by infecting snails with the miracidia hatched out of the spindle- shaped eggs obtained from a goat. Soparkar in 1921 published a detailed description of the cercaria of S. spindalis. There exists in this country a peculiar snoring disease of cattle in which cauliflower-like growths are developed on the nasal septum. Malkani in 1932 published a short note on the etiology of this condition declaring that it is a form of nasal schistosomiasis. The same year Datta [1932] published a paper giving exhaustive details about the symptoms and the histopathology of the morbid tissue. In the succeeding year Rao and Malkani [1933] pub- lished their own observations on the symptomology and the histopathology and other aspects of the disease. The question of the identity of the para- site was taken up by three workers in India : Bhalerao, Malkani and Rao. On the ground that the species S. spindalis is subject to many variations Bhalerao regarded the nasal schistosoma as a mere variety of S. spindalis, but he, being averse to the principle of multiplication of varieties within the range of the same species, abstained from assigning it a new variety name. Malkani, however, accomplished this and designated the G. D. BHALERAO 151 spindalis var. nasalis. Rao went a step further and regards the nasal schisto- some as a new species S. nasalis. It may be remarked here that the writers in the west such as Möning and Pillers uphold Bhalerao's view in this con- nection. One of the contentions in this respect is that it has been alleged that the nasal schistosome has been confined to the nasal area, but our recent knowledge on the subject does not substantiate this statement. A case from Assam revealed a typical Napoleon's hat-shaped ovum in a section of the in- testine of a bull. Two more cases have been reported to the writer by a re- liable worker in which the characteristic ova were found in the faeces of the infected animals. Researches of Rao and Sewell have shown that the intermediate hosts of this nasal parasite have been Limnaea luteloa, L. acuminata and Indopla- norbis exustus. Two important larval stages of this parasite, viz., miracidia and cercaria have been described by Rao and the disease has been artificially produced by him in cattle. The disease is also known to occur, although very rarely in buffaloes and goats. Datta [1933] published a paper describing the nodular portal cirrhosis in enlarged liver of horses in India, causing persistent debility and heavy mortality as due to ova of S. indicum. He published a report of eight cases, described the morbid anatomy of the various organs of the horse and dis- cussed the methods of diagnosis and control of the disease. There exists in India a disease of equines, known locally as kumri, which resembles to a large extent the better known-condition of equine paraplegia. Malkani in 1933 reported the occurrence of Schistosoma indicium worms from the liver and portal vessels of two kumri ponies at Patna. He obtained en- couraging results by treating the kumri ponies with sodium antimony tar- trate. On the basis of these two facts S. indicum has been looked upon by some as causing kumri in horses. This fact, however, requires corroboration before it can finally be accepted, for cases are known to the writer in which schistosomes were found but the animals did not show any symptoms of kumri. Besides the animals referred to previously, camels also are infected with S. indicum. Record of this infection has been made by Leese [191 1] who obtained the worms from the mesenteric veins of a camel in the Punjab. Next in importance to the infection of domestic ruminants and equines with schistosomes comes the infection of pigs with these worms. Sewell [1919] recorded the occurrence of a cercaria resembling that of S. japonicum in Indoplanorbis exustus and Limnaea amygdalum in Calcutta. Bhalerao [1934] described male worms from the intestine of pigs in Calcutta which he regarded as a variety of S. japonicum, but since he is against the principle of the multiplicity of new variety names he preferred to designate the worms from the pigs in Calcutta as S. japonicum. The main difference between this
152 Schistosomes and Schistosomiasis in India variety and the typical S. japonicum is that in the former the cuticle is tuber- culate while in the latter it is smooth. From his previous studies on S. spindalis and Ornithobilharzia turkestanicum and. of the specimens from pigs in Calcutta, he concludes that the nature of the cuticle is not of the specific significance. Rao and Ayyar in 1933 described a new schistosome from the portal veins of pigs in Madras which they designated as S. suis. These authors con- sider that the eggs of S. suis and those that were obtained by Chandler in 1926 in human faeces are identical. If this be a fact, the specific name S. suis [Rao & Ayyar, 1933] falls into the synonymy of S. incognitum [Chandler, 1926] and not vice versa as imagined by Rao and Ayyar. Very recently, Rao and Ayyar [1935] have recorded S. incognitum Chandler [Syn. S. suis Rao and Ayyar] from the faeces of a dog suffering from periodi- cal dysentery, which was brought from Jubbulpore (Central Provinces) to Ootacamund (Nilgiris) for treatment. There are very few records in this country of the indigenous infection of man with schistosomes. Powell [1903] reported a case of a native of Bombay who had never left the Bombay Presidency. Sewell [1904] recorded a case of Schistosoma haematobium occurring in a private of the 1st South Wales Borderer's. The patient had been four years in India and had never been to Egypt or South Africa. Christophers and Stephens [1905] mention a case of schistosome infection in a Madras native who passed eggs similar to those of S. bovis but somewhat larger and also eggs said to be indistinguishable from those of S. haematobium. Montgomery [1906] remarks that human schisto- somes can live in this country. Chandler [1926] recorded the presence of schistosome ova with a subterminal spine in the faeces of a. man from Bengal. Apart from these few records there has been no authentic proof of the existence of schistosome infection in man in this country. Several workers, however, have published from time to time, a record of schistosomiasis among people, particularly soldiers or pilgrims who had visited or stayed in areas of endemic infection: such workers being Hatch [1887], Powell [1903], Wardrop [1906], Crosthwait [1907], Milton [1914], Curjel [1918], Surveyor [1919], Franca and Mello [1921], Harkness [1922] and Cullen [1924]. Milton in 1919 put forward the view that human schistosomiasis is in all probability endemic in India and yet has hitherto entirely escaped the notice of medical men practising in this country. This statement of Milton created some stir among the scientists in this country and as an outcome of that there appeared in the same year three papers on the possible spread of schisto- somiasis in this country. Sewell [1919] contradicts Milton and thinks that endemic schistosomiasis is not possible in India since the proper kind of molluscs do not exist in this country. Kemp and Gravely [1919] hold a view similar to that of Sewell and further record their failure to infect snails with the miracidia of human schistosomes in the neighbourhood of Hyderabad (Dec- can) and Secunderabad. Soparkar in 1919 after discussing the pros and cons of the question concludes with the remarks that the question whether human
G. D. BHALERAO 153 bilharziosis is likely to spread in India cannot, in the present state of our knowledge, be answered with any degree of certainty either in the affirmative or in the negative. Besides the cases of natural infection dealt with so far, Fairley in 1927 and Fairley, Mackie and Jasudasan in 1930 tried to infect monkeys and guinea-pigs artificially with the cercaria of Schistosoma spindalis obtained from Indoplanorbis exustus and as a result of this they discovered that monkeys possess some natural immunity by virtue of which the development of cer- caria does not proceed beyond the schistosomula stage in them. In the case of guinea-pigs they found that only the male worms attain full development while no female worms are demonstrable at autopsy. They suggest that in these animals some host factor antagonistic to the development of female schistosomes underlies the phenomenon of exclusive male survival rather than initial unisexual infestation. Two water-buffaloes were also success- fully infected with S. spindalis by Fairley and Jasudasan [1927] and these buffaloes developed Bilharzial pseuclotubercles in the liver within three months. Coming now to the work on larval forms, besides the references to the work of Soparkar on the cercaria of Schistosoma spindalis and to that of Rao on the miracidia and cercaria of the nasal schistosome, Soparkar [1921] describ- ed from various molluscs in Bombay four new species of Cercaria bombayensis and Sewell [1922] recorded four new species of apharyngeal furcocercous cercariae. Sewell [1930] published a very valuable paper tracing the evolu- tion of the excretory system in certain groups of furcocercous cercariae. As a result of a very exhaustive study, Sewell concludes that throughout both pharyngeal and apharyngeal forms there is a marked tendency for the more posterior flame-cells to undergo division before those that are situated more anteriorly, and in brevifurcate cercariae there is a tendency for the anterior daughter cells produced by the division of the flame-cell in the tail stem to migrate into the distome body. In the same paper he also remarks that the suppression of the acetabulum and the consequent production of a mono- stome form has occurred on more than one occassion and on different lines of evolution. Besides the successful use of antimosan and sodium antimony tartrate as anthelmintics in cases of nasal schistosomiasis and kumri, Fairley [1924] used emetine hydrochloride and tartar emetic in cases of S. sptindalis infection of goats and he found that emetine hydrochloride possess a maximal efficacy in the treatment of this species. In the same publication Fairley made a statement that this may prove to be the case in human bilharziosis as well. Christopherson [1925] remarks that Fairley is unjustified in considering that because emetine proved superior to antimony tartrate against S. spindalis in goats it will prove equally efficacious in human bilharziosis as well. He- points out that in Fairley's own cases, emetine prove more toxic than antimony tartrate, and this is true for man also, as has been demonstrated by Kasr-el- Ainy in 1923.
154 Schistosomes and Schistosomiasis in India There is yet another aspect of the subject which has not been dealt with so far and this is in connection with the work on metazoon immunity. The workers who deserve credit for having tackled this important branch of science are Fairley and his collaborators : Fairley in 1925 and 1926 performed several tests with the antigen derivefcd from the dried powdered livers of Indoplanorbis exustus infected with the cercaria of Schistosoma spindalis and as a result of these tests he has drawn the following conclusions :G.

V. fodder in the diet of the dairy cows and their effect on the quality of the milk, with special reference to the value of the non-protein nitrogen. WATSON, S. J. and FERGUSON W. S. (J. Agric. Sci., 26, 337-367,1936). AN experiment was carried out to study the nutritive value of artificially dried grass and of silages prepared by two distinct processes, one with the addition of molas- ses which entails a fair degree of protein breakdown and the other A. I. V. silage where the protein breakdown is limited, in relation to the yield and quality of milk of dairy cows, with special reference to non-protein nitrogen whose feeding value has long been debated upon. Four lots of four cows each were fed for a continuous period of 17 weeks, one lot on the control ration (ordinary winter ration) consisting of hay, roots and concentrates and the other three on artificially dried grass, molassed silage and A. I. V. fodder respec- tively which replaced a considerable part of the concentrates. The rations had been so adjusted that each supplied equal amounts of starch equivalent and digestible crude protein for maintenance and milk production. The experimental foodstuffs were all of good quality, high digestibility, with a high proportion of crude protein ranging from 17 to 21 per cent of the dry matter and supplying half of the total digestible crude protein in the ration. Artificially dried grass was fed at the rate of approximately 8 lb. and molassed silage and A. I. V. fodder at 30 lb. per head daily and these supplied 5.9 per cent, 31.4 per cent and 25 per cent of the total digestible crude protein intake in the form of non-protein nitrogenous compounds, besides the 10 per cent of the diges- tible crude protein in the form of non-protein nitrogen compounds supplied by the basal ration. The control ration was low in carotene whilst the experimental ones raised the carotene intake appreciably. A statistical analysis of milk and butter-fat yields, butter-fat percentage and live- weight changes of the cows showed no significant differences between the four rations. The artificially dried grass diet had been the most efficient as regards its effects on solids- not-fat content of milk and the A. I. V. fodder the least. The other two rations showed no significant difference. The mean of all the cows showed a value just below that of the legal standard of 8.5 per cent solids-not-fat in milk and all the rations, except the artificially dried grass, were below the standard. The artificially dried grass, molassed silage and A. I. V. fodder had also increased the carotene content in milk and thus the vitamin A potency to a level equal to that of the grazing season for cows on pasture. Artificially dried grass; at the level fed, had replaced an equal weight of nutrients in the form of concentrated foodstuffs. Thus for milk production the digestible crude protein of the foodstuffs, whether present in the form of non-protein compounds to the extent of 30-40 per cent of the ni- trogen intake as in this experiment or as true protein, had all been utilized. (159)
160 ABSTRACTS The nutritive value of non-protein nitrogen in these two silages proved high, at the levels fed, thus showing that digestible crude protein is a better measure of the value of the nitrogen in these feeds than either digestible true protein or protein equivalent values. [ N. K.]. Vitamin deficiency diseases in poultry. BURMESTER, B. R. (Vet. Med., 32, 8, p. 364). WITH the development of poultry industry, involving as it does, intensification of production, has arisen the necessity for providing adequate nutrition, and in this connec- tion the author gives a brief summary of the position regarding various avitaminoses in poultry. Deficiency of Vitamin-K, a heat- and light-resistant, fat-soluble, unsaponifiable component of alfalfa or other green plants, produces a haemorrhagic condition in young chicks. The haemorrhages appear particularly in the muscle and in the subcutis, and are associated with an increase in the clotting time of the blood. Chicks fed on diets to produce the above condition often show erosion of the gizzard lining. Experiments have proved that the latter is due to the deficiency of a fat-soluble, saponifiable component of green plants and cereals. The disease is very often noticed in chicks kept on common chick rations and can be prevented or cured by supplying large amounts of alfalfa leaf-meal. The vitamin-B complex consists of several growth-promoting factors including the anti-neuritic Vitamin B1 found in yeast, egg, liver, cereals and green feeds, and the anti- pellagra vitamin-G or B2. Vitamin-G has recently been split up into at least three com- ponents one of which is the yellow green pigment Flavin or Vitamin-G proper found in alfalfa, whey and egg white. Deficiency of Flavin produces impaired growth, ema- ciation, diarrhoea and death in chicks and dermatitis in turkey poults and rats. The other two factors are factor No. 1 (probably Vitamin B6) of unknown significance and factor No. 2, or " filtrate factor," which produces dermatitis in chicks but not in turkey poults or rats. Other less-understood growth-promoting factors of the Vitamin-B Complex are vitamin B4, and two others which, if excluded from the diet, produce defective bone- formation (micromelia) and encephalomalacia respectively. Exclusion of Vitamin-A from the diet will produce nutritional roup and degenera- tive changes in the epithelium, thereby rendering the bird more susceptible to infection. Vitamin A is passed into the egg so that high-producing hens require a plentiful supply of it in their diet. Deficiency of vitamin-D in the diet produces in the growing bird a type of leg weak- ness which recent investigations have shown to be analogous to osteoporosis and not to rickets. Chicks can utilize the vitamin-D of animal source better than that derived from plants. [M. Y. M.]
ABSTRACTS 161 Ovine bacterial encephalitis (Circling disease) and the bacterial genus Listerella. GILL, D. A. (The Australian Veterinary Journal, 13, 2, 46). IN his previous two communications to the Veterinary Journal in 1931 and 1933, the author had described an encephalomyelitis or " circling disease " in sheep in New Zealand, associated with a Gram-positive motile bacillus seen in the mid-brain, and had given the biological and cultural characters of the organism. In the present article he has placed the organism under the genus Listerella which has been only recently created [ 1927 ] but is likely to assume considerable importance in veterinary and medical science as it is known to cause fatal disease in rodents like rabbits and guinea-pigs, and in sheep, cattle, fowls and human beings. In support, a review of literature is given which would be particularly useful to workers interested in the subject. Since the disease resembles louping ill but is distinct from it, Gill has proposed for it the name " Ovine Bacterial Encephalitis ", and has placed the causative bacillus under the species Listerella ovis. The disease appears to be wide spread and has been reported from Britain, Australia and America. In New Zealand it occurs during the end of summer and early winter months and is responsible for heavy losses. The symptoms are indicative of encephalitis and include circling movement. The patient is, in a few days, unable to stand and dies quickly thereafter. At autopsy, apart from the congested meninges and cloudy cere- bro-spinal fluid no other abnormality can be detected microscopically. Histologically, however, " cuffing " of blood vessels and foci of leucocytic infiltration, often containing the causative organism, are seen in the brain and spinal cord. The cerebral lesions are common in the mid-brain and the causative organism can be isolated from this site by inoculating blood agar plates with aseptically triturated material. The cloudy cerebro-spinal fluid shows a greatly increased (over 2,000 cells per cubic mm.) cell count. The ovine organism is rapidly fatal, by intravenous injection, to rabbits, the autopsy revealing acute meningitis and miliary necrotic foci in the liver. In both the situations the injected bacilli are abundant. Broth cultures of the organism given subcutaneously (1 c.c.) into sheep had no effect; given daily (10 c.c.) by stomach tube, produced a rapid rise of temperature which returned to normal after the first three days ; given intravenously (2 to 9 c. c.), produced a high fever, up to 108°F., which subsided after forty-eight hours ; given into the carotid artery (1 c.c.), produced typical " circling disease " clinically and histologically ; and given in- transally (10 c.c.), produced similarly positive results. The natural mode of infection is believed to be via the respiratory tract, and in this connection larvae of Oestrus ovis are suspected. The bacillus isolated by Gill grows with case and equally satisfactorily under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. No exotoxin appears to be formed. A filtrable form of the organism could not be detected. In serum agar slope cultures the bacillus gradually tends to lose the Gram-positive character. Work in connection with the epidemiology and immunology of the disease is in- dicated. [M. Y. M.].
162 ABSTRACTS Viability of parasitic protozoa after the death of the host. HEGNER, R. (Am. J. Hyg. 24, p. 309-31, 1936). EXACT data on the period of viability of each type of protozoan organism in a dead host are not available in literature, but they are required for assisting in the diagnosis of specific infections, in the understanding of immunity reactions and also in the elabora- tion of effective public health measures. The author has, therefore, carried out experi- ments to determine the extent to which the customary belief that with the death of the host the harboured parasites die out, is justified. The usual difficulties in arriving at diagnosis due to partial or complete disintegration of parasites during the interim between death and autopsy, as for instance in fatal cases of human dysentery where it may not be possible to decide whether the original incitant of lesions happened to be Entamoeba histolytica or Balantidium coli, and also the possibility of the histological study of the host-parasite relationship being vitiated due to the migratory and penetrative action of parasites in dead tissues, as may happen in amoebiasis, have been mentioned. The mode of infection with human sarcocysts and with blood-inhabiting protozoa and the infectivity of parasites lodged in the host's tissues or when voided outside the animal body have been discussed. The contradictory results obtained in autopsical survey of intestinal protozoa of man carried out by previous workers have been mentioned. Hegner's studies were restricted to protozoa in laboratory animals, including intes- tinal protozoa of rats, guinea pigs and frogs, malaria parasites in birds, and trypanosomes in rats. However, as the author points out, the experimental methods adopted by him are equally applicable in experiments with larger animals. Faecal smears from small animals having been found to be positive for trichomonad flagellates, the animals were killed by cervical shock. The caecum was withdrawn through an abdominal slit, and portions of the caecal contents extracted at varying times. A faecal pellet culture method was adopted, and its result controlled by direct cover-slip preparations from the caecal contents. Each time a portion of the material was planted into 1 to 3 culture tubes, and the tubes were tested at the end of three days, and the caecal material was examined first every 3 hours and later at 24 hours' interval. A counting method was used in the case of Balantidial cysts. Trichomonad flagellates remained alive and multiplied on transference to suitable media, after being in the caecum of a dead rat at 37°C. for 24 hours, at room temperature for 4 days, and at 5°C. for 13 days. Balantidial trophozoites were viable in the caecum of dead guinea pigs at room temperature or refrigerator for at least 4 days. Pig Balantidia when kept in Ringer's solution were viable at room temperature for 6 days. Intestinal protozoa of frogs, Nyctotherus, Opalina, Trichomonas and Hexamita were found to live up to 20 days in dead frogs. The ciliates were apparently less resistant than flagellates. Plasmodium cathe- merium in canaries is capable of infecting after the bird has been dead for 2 days, and Trypanosoma lewisi remained alive in the body of dead rats at room temperature for 3 days, and at 5°C. for 10 days. The parasites in a dead rat kept at 5°C. were capable of infecting clean rats after 9 days. Further the author attempted to demonstrate the failure of the trypanocidal antibody to appear at the peak of infection in dead rats. [S. C. A. D.].

Officer-in-Charge AND P. A. SESHAN, B.A. Assistant, Animal Nutrition Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, U. P. Received for publication on 25th May 1938) INTRODUCTION THE discovery of the fact that the proper growth, health and reproduc- tion of an animal involved other factors than a sufficiency of calories and protein has shifted the centre of interest in nutritional studies from quantity to quality. Among these accessory constituents of food, vitamin-A occupies a most important place. Although this substance has now become deter- minable by chemical and spectroscopical methods, our knowledge with regard to the requirements of the various animals and the conditions favourable to its proper utilization is so limited that the adequacy or inadequacy of a diet has to be judged by clinical observations only. The symptoms characteristic of avitaminosis-A are more or less well- defined. It would, however, be interesting to notice some recent cases on record. Fed on over-ripe timothy hay as sole roughage in addition to a mixture containing yellow corn meal, linseed meal, soya bean meal and wheat bran for about twelve months, four cows, negative to contagious abortion, consistently failed to have normal calves [Converse and Meigs, 1931]. A ration for pigs made up of white corn, buckwheat middlings, tankage and minerals or white corn, oats, linseed oil meal, tankage and minerals resulted in serious eye troubles, paralysis, respiratory trouble and convulsions [Long- well and Weakley, Jr., 1932]. A sow on a vitamin-A deficient diet gave birth to a litter of eleven pigs, all without eyeballs [Hale, 1933]. When the mother had received a diet short in vitamin-A content before mating and during the first thirty days of gestation, three litters of pigs were born with- * Paper read before the Section of Veterinary Research of the Indian Science Congress, held in Calcutta, January, 1938.

170 Vitamin-A Deficiency in the Diet of Farm Animals out eyeballs or with very serious eye defects [Hale, 1935]. It was shown that on a low vitamin-A diet, female rats were affected by a prolongation of the gestation period, with death of foetus in utero and failure of the mechanism of parturition, despite an abundant supply of vitamin-E [Mason, 1934, 1935]. Rabbits, guinea-pigs and albino rats developed xerophthalmia on a diet low in vitamin-A content while one monkey out of twenty-seven developed typical xerophthalmia with keratomalacia in both eyes [Hetler, 1934]. An adverse effect on the prostate was seen in eight pre-puberal rats aged thirty days and eight post-puberal ones aged 100 days all receiving a vitamin-A deficient diet. The change was taken to indicate a failure in the secretion of the male sex hormone. In five extreme cases of human malnutrition similar changes were also observed [Moore and Mark, 1936]. On a ration consisting of white corn ninety parts, fish meal seven and mineral mixture five, pigs, kept in sunlight but with no pasture, ceased to grow after 150 days and developed muscular in- co-ordination with spasms, lameness, lachrymation, blindness due to ulcera- tion, inflammation and congestion of the intestinal tracts and finally succumb- ed. White corn in the diet introduced a vitamin-A deficiency, since rats fed on it developed ophthalmia, lost weight and died even when the diet was irradiated and supplemented with five per cent yeast. Rat experiments and bone analysis showed that the diet was sufficient in vitamins Bl, B2 and D [Hostetler et al, 1935]. All the disorders mentioned above are both curable and preventable by an adequate supply of vitamin-A. The liver being the store house for this material in the animal body, the best sources of vitamin-A must neces- sarily be the livers themselves or their extracts properly concentrated. Escarole, cod-liver oil, halibut liver oil and " vogan " are some of such con- centrates. While these may be important as therapeutic doses for curative purposes, to include them in the regular dietary of animals would not be a practical proposition. Various investigations have, therefore, been carried out to determine the suitability or otherwise of different vegetables and plants as vitamin-A supplements. CAROTENE AS THE SOURCE OF VITAMIN-A IN PLANTS It is generally known that while vitamin-A as such is not available in plants, all green leaved or yellow rooted vegetables or plants contain various quantities of carotene, the precursor of vitamin-A, particularly in the earlier stages of growth. It has also been shown in an investigation on fifty-nine plant carotenes that while K. C. SEN AND P. A. SESHAN 171 both in the form of carotene and as colourless vitamin-A [Hart and Guil- bert, 1933]. In an experiment on cows it was observed that there were small amounts of carotene and much larger amounts of vitamin-A in the liver and milk fats. By feeding carrots, a rich source of carotene, at the end of winter feeding, both the vitamin-A and the carotene contents of butter in- creased [Moore, 1932]. It becomes clear, therefore, that so far as animals are concerned, the problem of vitamin-A deficiency resolves itself into an adequate provision of carotene in their normal feed which consists of grains, milled products and forage crops. Many observations have been recorded to the effect that carotene is closely associated with the pigments in a material. Yellow maize was found to be richer in vitamin-A than white maize [Mangelsdorf and Fraps, 1931]. Yellow corn and yellow corn meal seemed to be rich sources of vitamin-A while white corn contained little, if any. It was also noticed that the soil and season had influences on the vitamin-A content [Fraps, 1931]. Flour from wheat grown on irrigated land had a lower carotene content than the flour from dry land wheat [Whiteside, 1931]. In five varieties of maize it was found that the yellow variety had a higher vitamin-A potency than the white ones. The correlation between vitamin-A content and colour was true only with respect to the endosperm, the depth of colour of the pericarp being immaterial [Takahashi and Masuda, 1935]. In studying the distribution of carotene in the wheat grain, it was also observed that the variety of wheat had a greater influence than location, season or storage. The flour prepared in each case had a lower carotene content than the whole wheat. Bran had the highest concentration of carotene, then middlings, second patent flour and first clear flour, while the first patent flour had the least [Fifield, 1936]. The carotene content of twenty-nine varieties of whole wheat and seventy- two hybrid strains showed variations in two years of 1.66172 Vitamin-A Deficiency in the Diet of Farm Animals white maize decreased from thirty per cent at the beginning of the experiment to one per cent near the end. With yellow maize instead, the decrease was from forty-seven to nine per cent only [Treichler et al, 1935]. With regard to the soya bean too, the available data are conflicting. In fresh soya bean grown near Leipzig, vitamin-A was found in traces [Scheunert and Schieblich, 1935] while other experiments showed that the soya bean was so rich in vitamin-A that it could serve as the sole source of vitamin-A for feeding growing rats [Iwanova, 1935]. The carotene content of soya beans in India has been estimated as 710 international units per 100 grm. [Aykroyd, 1936]. On the other hand, when the linseed oil meal in the grain feed of a dairy ration was replaced by raw or cooked soya beans, the vitamin-A value of butter went down from the neighbourhood of 23 to 28 Sherman units to about 15 to 18 units per grm. The replacement of alfalfa hay by soya bean hay had also a similar effect [Wilbur et al, 1935]. It should be mentioned here that vegetable oils such as earthnut, gingelly, cocoanut, linseed, mustard and hemp seed oils were found to contain very negligible traces of vitamin-A, red palm oil being the only exception [Rose- dale and Oliviero, 1934 ; Lo T-Y, 1935]. A spectrographic study of several vegetable oils in this country also showed that they were all negative for vitamin-A [De, 1935]. Vitamin-A being a fat soluble one, the oil cakes that are generally used in animal feeding would not contain any significant amount of this constituent. It is apparent, therefore, that to provide an adequate supply of vitamin-A in the feed of animals in general and farm stock in particular, a proper choice of forage plants either as the main feed or as a supplement is the only possible method. It would be useful in this connection to remember that there are certain factors which affect the vitamin-A content of vegetables and plants in general. White, yellow, orange, garden and field varieties of carrots, grown under greenhouse conditions, showed on analysis that the most highly coloured carrots contained 9.6 mg. of carotene per 100 grm. while white varieties yielded only l/80th of this amount [Bills and McDonald, 1932]. The vitamin-A content of the outer green leaves of Iceberg lettuce was found to be 34.5 Sherman units per grm. of leaf, while the inner bleached leaves gave a con- tent of 1 unit [Munsell and Kennedy, 1935]. A study of the variations in the carotene content of Kentucky blue grass, green growing alfalfa, carrot, etc., revealed the fact that green plants were very rich and dried or brown leaves very poor in carotene [Shinu et al, 1935]. The carotene content of the corn plant and of the silage made from it was found to depend upon the greenness of the plant at cutting [Kane and Cary, 1935]. Veld grass samples from Bechuanaland showed a low carotene content at different seasons during two years. Only the fresh growth after rain was rich and there was pro- gressive deterioration as the pasture dried up [Myburgh, 1936]. It has further been observed that manuring had no effect on the carotene or the vitamin-A activity of Cumbu leaves and that under all conditions of growing the carotene content decreased with the age of the crop (Sci. Rep.
K. C. SEN AND P. A. SESHAN 173 Govt. Agric. Chem. Coimbatore, 1932-33). Vegetables had their carotene content markedly increased by a fertilization of the soil with nitrogen, phos- phate and potash. Irradiation by neon light of parsley, chive and spinach increased their yield and vitamin-A content [Pfutzer and Pfaff, 1935]. Several attempts have been made to estimate the carotene content of some of the commoner pasture plants in their fresh green stage. Timothy grass contained 200±13 Sherman units per grm. of fresh material, red top 308±10, smooth brome grass 396±27, alfalfa 269±17, white blossom sweet clover 242±19 and 500±30 respectively in the second and first years, orchard grass 275±13 and meadow fescu 250±13. Based on these results it has been advised that dairymen could select any mixture of pasture plants adapted to their particular climatic and soil conditions without any risk of producing a vitamin-A deficiency [Woods, et al, 1935, 1935-a, 1935-b]. In making an estimate of the vitamins in the diet of pigs, the vitamin-A contents of air- dried rye grass and sun-cured pasture hay have been put down as 3,500 and 1,000 international units per 100 grm. [Cunningham, 1936]. VITAMIN-A REQUIREMENT OF ANIMALS We have so far concerned ourselves with avitaminosis-A and the possible sources through which it can be averted in so far as it relates to animal nutri- tion. The effect of providing the animal with its normal requirement of vitamin-A would just enable the animal to have its proper health, growth and production. It is, therefore, desirable to obtain an idea as to the require- ments of the various animals for carotene or vitamin-A for prophylactic and curative purposes. To prevent and cure xerophthalmia in rats on a vitamin-A deficient diet, it was found sufficient to give a daily dose of 0.5 to 1.0 174 Vitamin-A Deficiency in the Diet of Farm Animals yellow maize was deemed a sufficient vitamin-A supplement, any further additions of vitamin-A concentrates to the ration being of no additional benefit [Sheehy, 1932]. It has, however, been pointed out that a 100 lb. pig should have the equivalent of four mg. carotene daily in its diet to satisfy its vitamin-A requirements for maintenance and normal growth [Dunlop, 1935]. In an investigation into the minimum vitamin-A requirements of cattle, it was noticed that animals receiving a small daily ration of cod-liver oil or alfalfa meal for two years showed scarcely any storage, the total reserve of the body being estimated at 200 mg. of carotene and vitamin-A. It was also determined that the rate of depletion of this reserve was about 9 to 11 K. C. SEN AND P. A. SESHAN 175 assay of the vitamin-A contents of the normal liver of some animals such as oxen, guinea-pigs, rabbits rats and dogs showed considerable variations, the liver of the guinea-pig being the least and that of the oxen the most potent [Simmonet et al, 1932]. Goat liver was found to have a reserve more than twice that of the bull liver and six times that of rabbit liver [Sen and Sharma, 1936]. The livers of cows had about four to five times the vitamin-A contents of those of bullocks, while calves showed no such difference between the sexes [Ender, 1934]. Eighteen-month-old rats which had finished breed- ing were fed for about twelve weeks on a vitamin-A sufficient diet super- imposed by a large amount of some concentrate. The vitamin-A concentra- tion in the liver at the end of this period was 18,000 blue units per grm. Put on to a deficient diet at this stage, the concentration fell down to 2,700 units per grm. in four weeks and in twelve weeks to about 400 units [Davies and Moore, 1935]. Some beef steers receiving throughout the summer a diet found optimal for storage purposes were changed to a diet deficient in vita- min-A. Sixty-three, 121 and 282 days later it was estimated that there was a progressive decrease in the vitamin-A of the livers showing that there was a continuous depletion from the amounts stored when they had been fed in excess. The concentration of vitamin-A in the livers of cows receiv- ing a rich ration was found to be approximating to that in cod-liver oil. New born calves from well-fed cows showed only a low concentration of vitamin-A in their livers, although the colostrum was rich [Guilbert and Hart, 1934]. Rats which had received vitamin-A to the order of 5,000 times the necessary minimum before and during gestation threw young ones with only small amounts in their livers. These amounts could be slightly increased by feed- ing a diet to the mother which was rich in fat as well as in vitamin-A [Dann, 1934]. Although it has been shown that a high vitamin-A reserve in the liver of a cow did not give rise to a high vitamin-A content in the liver of her calf, it has been shown by several workers that it is immediately reflected in her milk and butter. The fact that the carotene and vitamin content of the feed exert a considerable and proportionate influence upon the carotene and vita- min-A of the milk and butter-fat has been borne out by a large volume of work wherein studies have been made with various concentrates and vegetable and plant feed as sources of the vitamin-A intake [Moore, 1932 ; Fraps and Treichler, 1932 ; Copeland and Fraps, 1932 ; Watson et al, 1933 ; Gillam et al, 1933 ; Baumann et al, 1934 ; Fraps et al, 1934 ; Converse et al, 1935 ; Beeson, 1935 ; Hilton et al, 1935 ; Wilbur et al, 1935 ; Treichler, 1935 ; Steensberg, 1936]. During the course of the work on the effect of the feed on the carotene and vitamin-A content of milk and butter, it was observed that the breed of the animal was also a factor in transmitting the reserves in the system through the milk. In cows kept under comparable conditions, Guernsey cows' butter gave a carotene value of 7.8 176 Vitamin-A Deficiency in the Diet of Farm Animals Brown Swiss and Jersey cows gave intermediate values [Baumann et al, 1934]. In a comparison between Holstein and Ayrshire butters it was found that biologically both had the same total vitamin-A potency [Beeson, 1935]. The butter-fats of Guernsey and Holstein breeds were approximately equal in vitamin-A potency but definitely superior to those of the Ayrshire and Jersey. The carotene contents under winter conditions were, Ayrshire 1.45 mg. per kg., Holstein 1.95, Jersey 2.05 and Guernsey 3.45 ; under summer pasture the figures were 4.7, 8.0, 12.1 and 20.5 mg. carotene per kg. of butter respectively [Sutton and Krauss, 1936]. Another experiment showed that the carotene and vitamin-A value of the butter of Guernsey, Friesian, Ayrshire and Shorthorn cows were in descending order [Gillam et al, 1936]. It has been suggested that each breed of cow would have a " ceiling value " above which it would not be possible to increase the vitamin-A potency of its milk or butter [Gillam and Heilbron, 1934]. CONSERVATION OF VITAMIN-A POTENCY OF ROUGHAGES It has already been found that most forage plants in their fresh young stage yield a sufficiency of vitamin-A to animals fed or grazed on them. If an animal is, therefore, assured of green feed as a major fraction of its rough- age, then the vitamin-A problem in cattle ceases to exist. But, however, desirable it may be, it may not be possible under practical conditions of farm- ing to provide such feed throughout the year. The problem, thus, reduces itself to a question of fodder preservation with a view to retain the carotene content of the plant at the optimum level. Ensilage is one of the methods of preservation which has been tried in this connection. In studying the effects of the feed on the carotene content of butter, it was observed that forty lb. of A. I. V. silage in the feed raised the yellow colour to a level comparable with that found on best pasture, while the vitamin-A content was doubled [Gillam and Heilbron, 1932]. Corn silage was found to be a valuable source of vitamin-A for feeding dairy animals [Russell et al, 1935]. A. I. V. silage made from grass and clover or young alfalfa were tested as suitable vitamin-A feeds to dairy cows. It was found that thirty kg. of the former and fourteen kg. of the latter gave adequate response [Steensberg, 1936]. Winter milk from cows fed on A. I. V. silage was as high in vitamin-A potency as that of summer milk on pasture, namely, about three times that of cows fed on hay, concentrates and roots. The A. I. V process resulted in good silage which preserved the carotene and vitamin-A contents of the green plants intact. It may also be pointed out incidentally that while hay-making destroyed the vitamin-C entirely, in the A. I. V. silage half of it was preserved [Virtanen, 1935]. Hay-making is another method of fodder preservation which can be utilised for the preservation of the carotene content of fodder plants. The factors involved in hay-making are so prejudicial to the retention of carotene or vitamin-A activity that much attention has been devoted to finding out the best process of hay-making to suit the vitamin-A requirements of animals
K. C. SEN AND P. A. SESHAN 177 Studying the effects of ultra-violet radiations on vitamin-A, it was shown by biological tests that up to one hour of exposure there was no loss, while after four hours of irradiation only 1.5 per cent of the original content re- mained. But the colour test showed that the destruction started at once and that there still remained 30 per cent after thirty-two hours of exposure [Norris, 1931]. The vitamin-A content in alfalfa was found to decrease with age whether kept ground or chopped. Curing alfalfa in cocks in the field had the same effect as curing in diffuse light of varying intensity. When this hay was cured in windrows exposed to sunlight, only 2/3rds of the potency was lost while the hay exposed to sunlight with rain and dew lost 3/4ths [Hartman, 1931]. Drying alfalfa in the field caused a greater loss of potency, probably through enzyme action, than when dried by hot air or hot flue gas. Warmth and moisture favoured the destruction of vitamin-A, whilst cold, rapid drying or autoclaving hindered it [Hauge and Aitkenhead, 1931]. Alfalfa hay, protected from the sun while curing, contained four to five times as much vitamin-A as the hay exposed to the sun and rain [Reed, 1931]. Alfalfa which was removed from the field as soon as cut and stored in a dark, well- ventilated room, was compared with exposed ones. Exposure for 2¾ to 6¾ hours led to a loss of twenty to thirty per cent of vitamin-A but none of the green colour. Overnight exposure in the field caused a loss of seventy-five per cent of its content while a week's sun and rain bleached the hay severely and destroyed about ninety-six per cent of its potency [Smith and Briggs, 1933]. Sun-cured hay exposed to one inch or more of rain was less potent than that cured in diffuse sunlight, the vitamin-A content varying from 10 to 60 Sherman units per grm. of hay. Growth of moulds had deleterious effects on all vitamins [Douglas et al, 1933]. The vitamin-A and -D contents of hay dried quickly at 68° C. in two hours were much greater than when slowly dried in meadows or frames [Rygh, 1934]. Machine dried alfalfa has a higher vitamin-A con- tent than the field dried ones. Rapid loss of carotene occurred in field curing in day light. Dried alfalfa, finely ground, could be stored in vacuo at 0° C. without loss [Russell et al, 1934]. Vacuum dried alfalfa, dried for three hours at 100° C., had as much carotene as the fresh leaves, while the field cured ones and the commercially dehydrated ones had the same content of carotene, 25.3 mg. per 100 grm. The vacuum dried alfalfa hay contained 52 mg. per 100 grm. [Guilbert, 1934]. Vitamin-A potency of freshly cut alfalfa could be retained if the enzymes were destroyed immediately before drying. The destruction attributed to sunlight might be attributable to the higher temperatures produced accelerating the enzymatic activity [Hauge, 1935]. No loss was noticed on vacuum drying but autoclaving and sun-drying caused considerable losses. In slow drying, enzymic and bacterial action had their part. Below 5° C. a storage of six months did not show any loss. Tempera- ture was found to be the most influencing factor in decreasing the vitamin-A potency of hay [Guilbert, 1935]. When alfalfa was cut and cured in the cock in fresh condition it had a vitamin-A content of 308±13 units per grm. On being ground and stored for four months it was 233±20. When exposed in the swathe for one day before cocking it had 144 ± 10 units per grm., whereas
178 Vitamin-A Deficiency in the Diet of Farm Animals an exposure for three days before cocking gave a hay with only 116±9 units per grm. It was also found that cock cured and unstacked hay kept for two and a half months contained 233±20 units per grm. but hay stacked for forty-nine days had only 144±10 units [Woods et al, 1936]. Briefly stated, the provision of an adequate supply of vitamin-A in the dietary of animals, particularly cattle can be accomplished only by making their natural feed richer in carotene content and not by feeding vitamin-A concentrates. In India their main feed consists generally of a roughage and a concentrate ration, the feeding of carrots and other roots not being common. The concentrate ration is generally composed of grains and oil-cakes which cannot be made to yield appreciable amounts of vitamin-A. Hence animals have to be provided with fresh green feeds, which under ordinary farm condi- tions provide an adequate amount of carotene. As it may not be possible to provide such a feed throughout the year on any large scale, the methods of preservation of fodder plants without destruction of the vitamin-A potency have to be investigated. Ensilage and hay-making are the two methods open and considerable work has to be done with regard to these aspects of the question. It should also be stated that by proper plant breeding, fodder crops with improved carotene contents could be developed. CONCLUSION In the foregoing pages, a general review has been given of the carotene contents of various stock feeds and the requirements of vitamin-A for the proper maintenance of the health of live-stock. It would be appropriate here to consider the question of avitaminosis-A under Indian conditions. It has been shown elsewhere [Guilbert et al, 1934] that vitamin-A deficiency in the diet of farm stock may occur both under stall feeding conditions as well as when grazing and the common symptoms areK. C. SEN AND P. A. SESHAN 179 It has been shown previously that the maintenance requirement of caro- tene for average cattle may be considered to be about 14 mg. per day. A recent analysis has shown that rice straw from three different parts of India did not contain any carotene and the same was also true of various concen- trate rations used in our dairy farms. Consequently with a diet based on these concentrates and rice straw as the sole roughage, there is a gross defi- ciency of vitamin-A in the diet. Various samples of hay have also shown negli- gible amounts of carotene contents. The importance of choosing proper diets including a good variety of green fodder is, therefore, quite evident and needs no further comment. It is to be remembered here that every green fodder is not an equally rich source of carotene, jowar, maize and some varieties of pasture grass being much poorer than clover, lucerne or berseem. In conclusion, it may be emphasised that the problem of avitaminosis-A in cattle and especially in milch cows has far greater significance than what appears on the surface. It has been pointed out already that the vitamin-A content of milk is dependent on the quality of the feed given to the cow and as milk is probably the most important source of vitamin-A for growing children, avitaminosis-A in cattle is intimately connected with the Public Health problem in India. This aspect of the question was dealt with in detail by Colonel Sir Arthur Olver in his Presidential address to the Medical and Veterinary Research Section of the Indian Science Congress in 1937 under the title " The relation of animal nutrition to Public Health in India " and no further elaboration is, therefore, required at present. SUMMARY This paper attempts to summarise the present position of avitaminosis-A so far as it relates to the practical feeding of farm animals. Cereals, grain feeds, vegetable oils and oil-cakes are found to be poor sources of carotene (the precursor of vitamin-A) which is generally associated with the pigments of all plant material. Green young forage plants are, however, found to be satisfactory sources of carotene for animals. The vitamin-A requirements of rats, dogs, poultry, swine and cattle are discussed. The excretion, storage and depletion of the vitamin-A reserve of animals through reproduction and milk are described. The point is stressed that the provision of suitable green feeds and pasture lands is the only practical method of supplying the carotene requirement of farm animals. In this connection, the importance of preserving the vita- min-A potency of green plants when converted into hay or silage has also been emphasised. The existence of avitaminosis-A in a mild form under the ordinary condi- tions of stock feeding in India and the need of rectifying this condition are also considered.

(LOND.) Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on the 10th June 1938) (With Plate IV) THE family Piroplasmidae to which belongs the genus Babesia is placed amongst sporozoa under the order Haemosporidia. But since the publica- tion of Breinl and Hindle's [1908] work on Babesia canis, the consideration of a probable relationship of the genus Babesia with the flagellate, has become a matter of considerable importance from the systematic point of view. Find- ing of flagellate forms at some stage of its development in the body of the vertebrate host has, in a way, paved the way for putting forth the arguments in favour of flagellate origin of this genus. Thomson and Fantham [1913] who have successfully cultivated Babesia canis in vitro did not, however, come across any flagellate stage as shown by Breinl and Hindle. Dennis [1930] while working on the morphology of Babesia bigemina, the causative organism of Texas fever, came to a somewhat similar inference although actual flagellate forms were not encountered by him. An extra- nuclear granule, or blepharoplast and its connection with the nucleus similar to that described for Babesia canis has also been shown to be present in Babesia bigemina except that in the former a flagellum was found to originate from the granule while in the latter this organelle was absent. Presence of this extra- nuclear granule or ' blepharoplast' was considered by Dennis a feature of sufficient importance to suggest its flagellate affinity. Smith and Kilbourne [1893] who first described the organism of Texas fever did not give any account of the nuclear structure. Laveran and Nicolle [1899] pointed out that the nucleus was situated at the broad pole of the para- site and that it consisted of a ' karyosome ' with a clear area around it. Fan- tham [1907] gives a detailed description of the distribution of the chromatin* in this organism. His observations, however, were based on dried smears stained with one of the Romanowsky stains, a method which cannot be relied upon for studying the cytological details. Nuttall and Graham-Smith [1908] describe the nucleus as a small granule with a row of granules extending * I put this word in italics because any structure that stained pink or red with Romanowsky's stain is usually described as chromatin without paying much attention to its true chemical composition which according to Feulgen (1927) is mainly built upon the thymonucleic acids as its base. (183)
184 Nuclear Structure of Babesia bigemina from it; these authors have also shown that the nucleus is situated at the pointed end of the pyriform body. This is of course quite opposed to what has been described by Laveran and Nicolle. In order to determine what actually is the position of the Indian strain of Babesia bigemina with regard to its nuclear structure, detailed observations were made on wet fixed smears. The results of studies incorporated in this article will at once reveal that the structure of the nucleus is quite different from what has hitherto been described. The nucleus is confined to the point- ed end of the parasite and consists of ' karyosome ', a nuclear membrane, and finely granular chromatin. No indication of any extra nuclear granule or blepharoplast was present in the preparations used for this study. MATERIAL AND METHODS Material for study was obtained from hill-bulls which showed heavy in- fection with B. bigemina as a result of resuscitation due either to experimental theileriasis or rinderpest. Wet blood smears were fixed in Bouin-Duboscq- Brasil's fluid, alcoholic Bouin's fluid, Schaudinn's fluid and Carnoy's fluid. Smears were fixed for fifteen to twenty minutes except in Carnoy's in which they were kept for five minutes. Stains used were Heidenhains iron-alum haematoxylin, Giemsa and Mallory's triple stain. In order to determine the distribution of chromatin in the nucleus, the method of Feulgen's nucleal reac- tion was employed. It may be mentioned here that this reaction is based on the hydrolysis of other constituents such as guanine and adenine combined with thymonucleic acid by means of dilute hydrochloric acid at 60°C. and later on obtaining a permanent colour reaction by treating it with basic fuchsine. By this method, so far as is known at present, the proper seat of chromatin in a nucleus can be ascertained with accuracy. Smears treated in this way were counterstained with light green in ninety per cent alcohol. Some of the smears instead of being counterstained with light green were stained in iron-alum- haematoxylin. This method of staining revealed a granule which was invisible in Feulgen preparations. Various pictures of the parasites thus obtained were compared and careful Camera lucida drawings were made in each case. OBSERVATIONS The routine method of staining with Giemsa or Lieshman stain showed so-called chromatin at various places of the pear-shaped organisms and needs little mention from the point of view that dry smears are useless for studying the cytological details. In such preparations a deeply stained pink or red granule appears at the broad pole of the parasite which was interpreted as being a nucleus by Laveran and Nicolle [1908]. Besides this granule, however, a deeply stained area is also seen at the pointed end of the parasite. This was studied in great detail by Nuttall and Graham-Smith [1908] and it was pointed out by them that the nucleus was, truly speaking, situated at the apical end of the organism and consisted of a granule from which extend a number of small granules after the manner of comet (Plate IV, fig. 1). As a matter of fact
H. N. RAY 185 this is exactly the picture of the nucleus which one gets so often in dry pre- parations stained with one of the Romanowsky stains. But it must be said that this holds good only in cases where we are dealing with the typical pear- shaped organism. In rounded or amoeboid forms a single deeply stained granule is usually more prominent than others (Plate IV, fig. 2). In preparations fixed in any of the fixatives mentioned above and stained in iron-alum-haematoxylin shows only a dark dot at the apex of the parasite and sometimes a dark thread-like structure can be seen extending from it. The granule at the broad end which is two to four times as big as one at the apex, also takes up a deep black stain, but in no case was this structure seen to be connected with that thread. Dennis [1930] has also called this bigger granule the nucleus and has shown that it is connected with the smaller one which he refers to as the blepharoplast by means of a rhizoplast. Round this bigger granule he has demonstrated the presence of a nuclear membrane186 Nuclear Structure of Babesia bigemina The nucleus in Babesia bigemina as described above, is situated at the narrow apical end of the organism and consists of a karyosome surrounded by a circlet of fine granules, arranged at the periphery of the nuclear membrane. With this data at our disposal we can no longer entertain the theory of flagel- late origin of this sporozoan as propounded by Dennis [1930]. SUMMARY The nuclear structure of the Indian strain of Babesia bigemina has been studied in detail. The nucleus is found to consist of a karyosome surrounded by a circlet of fine granules which give a positive Feulgen reaction. These fine granules are arranged at the periphery of an achromatinic nuclear mem- brane. The nucleus is situated at the narrow apical end of the pyriform body. A granule which is sometimes seen at the broad pole of the parasite, is two to four times the size of the karyosome and gives a negative Feulgen reaction. With iodine and Best's carmine this granule gives a faintly posi- tive reaction for glycogen. REFERENCES Breinl, A. and Hindle, E. (1908). Ann. Trop. Med. & Parasit. 2, 233-248. Dennis, E. W. (1930).

Only four reports are available from different parts of the world, recording the occurrence of the disease in eight animals. Zschokke [1913] found Rhinosporidium in the nasal growth from a horse in South Africa sent to him by Theiler. Fourteen years later Quinlan and de Kock [1926] found the parasite in the nasal growths of two mules in South Africa. Cordero and Vogeslang [1928] reported their finding of the fungus in the nasal *Paper read at the Jubilee Session of the Indian Science Congress, held in Calcutta, January, 1938. (187)
188 Rhinosporidiosis in Bovines growth from a horse in Uraguay. Ayyar [1929 and 1932] in South India detected the fungus in the nasal growths from two bullocks, one cow and one pony. It is, therefore, interesting to note that while this disease has been met with in a small number of equines in different parts of the world, its existence in bovines has been reported, so far, only from the Madras Presidency. It has been possible for the present author, during the last six years, to record rhinosporidiosis in eighteen bovines and one pony in this presidency, in addition to those already reported by Ayyar [1929]. Ayyar's cases were all from Tanjore district, but the following table shows that the disease exists in other districts as well. The fact that twenty-three cases of rhinosporidiosis (including two equines) in the Madras Presidency have been detected within a period of eight years indicates that the disease is not so rare among animals in this part of India as it is supposed to be. The present writer has not found the disease in cows so far, and most of the cases noted in the table below were detected while examining nasal washings for nasal schistosomiasis. *TABLE I Serial No. Year Name of District Name of Town Kind of Animal Age Seat of Tumour 1 1930 Chingleput Madras .

In the Madras Presidency rhinosporidiosis in man has been reported fairly frequently from certain districts and it is interesting to note that the bovines noted above are also from those very districts. So far, all the reported cases of rhinosporidiosis in animals have been from districts other than the Northern Circars ; opportunity is now taken to record the first case in a pony at Cocanada, East Godavari. No cases of rhinosporidiosis in bovines or equines have been reported from Northern India. Allen and Dave [1936] state that at their instance, the Director of Veterinary Services, Central Provinces, issued instructions to his staff to look for rhinosporidial growths in animals in that province but no cases were reported. Those authors made enquiries in the Drug district of Central Provinces and failed to obtain even one infected animal, though they saw over sixty human beings affected with the disease in Raipur and Drug districts. This seems interesting as far as it goes, but compared to what obtains in the Madras Presidency, it seems reasonable to assume that cases of rhinospori- diosis in bovines or equines have escaped diagnosis till now and it may not be long before such cases come to light. 2. SITE OF INFECTION The predilection seat for rhinosporidial growths in animals appears to be the nasal mucous membrane. In all the bovine and equine cases re- ported so far, such growths were found only in the lower third of the nasal cavity. An analysis of the clinical histories of the affected bovines shows that the growth is either found on the margin of the hole on the nasal septum made for the nose string or by the side of the sessile lesions of nasal schistoso- miasis, in the lower third of the nasal cavity. Hence, it would appear that trauma is a necessary factor for the development of rhinosporidial tumours. The author learns that in certain parts of Northern India, the system of puncturing the nasal septum is not in vogue, and that nasal schistosomiasis exists there. Therefore, there is at least one factor present in causing trauma in the nose in cattle and adequate investigation may result in demonstrating the existence of the disease in bovines in that part of India.
190 Rhinosporidiosis in Bovines 3. SEX AND AGE INCIDENCE As far as the twenty-one bovines included in the present studies are concerned, it is interesting to observe that twenty animals or roughly 95 per cent of the cases were bullocks. In the human beings the incidence of the disease is very much higher in males than in females and it is found to be the case in bovines also. This common sex incidence in bovines and in human beings is somewhat significant and will be discussed later. The affected animals were all between the ages of four and nine with one exception, a bull-calf (vide Table I), which was reported to be only 2½ years old. Bulls and bullocks are put to the plough when they are about 3½ years of age and their noses are punctured for nose strings when they are about that age. Cows are very rarely used for ploughing in Southern India and their nasal septum is seldom punctured for a nose string. 4. DURATION OF THE DISEASE AND RECURRENCE OF THE GROWTHS AFTER EXCISION It has not been possible to obtain exact data regarding the total duration of the disease in bovines, except in one case, a bullock aged about nine years which was reported to have had the condition for over a period of about five years. As regards recurrence of the growths after removal, it has been observed from some of the available history sheets that the growths re-appear in about twelve to sixteen months. In a bullock which was kept under observation by the author, the growth did not recur till eleven months after removal. That animal was destroyed and its nasal mucous membrane was sectioned and examined but no Rhinosporidium was detected. It would appear, therefore, that recurrence depends on whether or not, the diseased tissue has been removed completely along with the adjoining healthy tissue. 5. CONCURRENT INFECTION Out of the fifteen animals whose histories are known eight (or 54.4 per cent) had nasal schistosomiasis as well. 6. CLINICAL FEATURES The tumours caused by Rhinosporidium in bovines and equines can be classed under two types, viz. (1) Pedunculated and (2) Sessile. The size of the growths is seldom bigger than a large playing marble. The sessile types of tumours are more or less flat and are usually associated with the lesions of nasal schistosomiasis and appear to be seldom bigger than a double bean. The growths appear more or less lobulated, soft and spongy. The surfaces of both types of tumours are dotted over with small white specks which repre- sent the sporangia or asci of Rhinosporidium. The growths are pink or reddish in colour and bleed readily when handled. It is interesting to note that in all the cases observed so far, the lesions were unilateral in the nose.

M. ANANT NARAYAN RAO 191 In bovines suffering from the disease, the symptoms simulate those of nasal schistosomiasis. The presence of nasal discharge and snoring noise during breathing are found in both the conditions, hence clinical diagnosis may not be easy, excepting when the lesions of Rhinosporidium alone exist, in which case, the nasal discharge may be unilateral. Diagnosis is easy with the aid of the microscope under which spores or sporangia of Rhinosporidium are seen in the nasal discharge. This similarity of the clinical symptoms of the two diseases of the nose perhaps accounts for the non-recognition of the condition in bovines in countries where nasal schistosomiasis exists. All the cases in Southern India were diagnosed microscopically in the laboratory. 7. HISTOPATHOLOGY AND LIFE-HISTORY OF THE ORGANISMS In a section of the rhinosporidial growth papillary processes of the epithe- lium are seen. Under the epithelium is found a stroma of delicate fibrous or fibro myxomatous tissue in which are present the sporangia or asci of Rhinospo- ridium. This sub-epithelial tissue is very vascular with young or newly developed capillaries. In addition, one finds infiltration with polymorpho- nuclear cells, lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophiles and red blood cells in the tissue. Giant cells are also met with though rarely. In the crypts, formed between the papillary processes, are seen morular spores embedded in the nasal mucus. Those spores evidently were discharged by the asci. The asci appear to be more numerous under the epithelium and the fully developed ones are usually just below it. The large asci under the epithelium seem to press upon that tissue which yields to pressure from below and ultimately ruptures, thus enabling the mature ascus to discharge its spores with the nasal mucus outside the animal body. Very few of the mature asci appear to liberate their spores in the soft tissue in which they develop and this fact is evident from their ruptured walls and the number of young sporangia seen, particularly in the vicinity of the mature ascus. Though mature asci contain a large number of spores, yet it is interesting to note that the number of young sporangia is very much less than the number of spores which may have been discharged in the soft tissue of the tumour. The only hypo- thesis that can be advanced to account for the small number of sporangia, compared with the number of spores liberated, appears to be the presence of antagonistic body cells and their lysins which destroy most of the spores. The smallest developing trophozoite is rounded or ovoid and measures about 6 to 8 µ and is filled with granular protoplasm in which is present a nucleus with a nucleolus. It is interesting to note that the smallest developing tropho- zoite resembles the small sized spore in an ascus, a reference to which will be made later. A study of the developing trophozoites in sections reveals exactly what has been described by Ashworth [1923] and the details need not be entered into here. A fully grown ascus is rounded or slightly oval and measures 250 to 300 µ in diameter. The thickness of the wall varies in mature asci in proportion to the size of the ascus, the mature ones having compara- tively thin walls. In some young asci the so-called " pore " through which
192 Rhinosporidiosis in Bovines the spores are said to escape, is seen in the wall depending upon the orientation of the ascus in section. The spores in an ascus vary in their sizes ; some of them are large, and each large spore has a capsule containing a nucleus and proteinacious granules and the rest are small spores with no capsule and contain finely granular protoplasm and a nucleus. The large spore measures 8 to 10 µ and the small one 5 to 7 µ. 8. IDENTITY OF THE PARASITE It is interesting to note that rhinosporidiosis in cattle occurs in such areas in the Madras Presidency where it is known to exist in man. There appears to be no difference in the histopathology of the lesion or in the morphology of the fungus in the material obtained either from man, bovine or equine. Wenyon [1926] doubts the existence of any specific differences between equine and human rhinosporidiosis. Ayyar [1932] pointed out that there is a very close resemblance between the human and bovine lesions as regards the site of growth, gross appearance of the tumour, its histology and the morphology of the sporangia, etc. He sent some of his material to Ashworth who confirmed those findings and said that the discovery of Rhinosporidium in bovines may throw light on the mode of infection. Allen and Dave [1936] also said that the sections of rhinosporidial lesions from cattle looked very similar to those from man. The author could not find any specific difference in the morphology of the causal organism or in the histopathology of the lesions in men, bovines or equines. It would appear, therefore, that the causal organism of rhinospo- ridiosis in man and animals is identical. This conclusion seems to throw light on the mode of transmission as prophesied by Ashworth and will be discussed later. 9. DISSEMINATION OF SPORES FROM THE LESIONS The mature ascus may burst upon the nasal mucous membrane liberating the spores on its surface or it may burst in the soft tissue. In the former case the spores get mixed up with the nasal mucus and may be passed outside the animal body, or as it usually happens in cattle or even in human beings, they may be swallowed with the nasal mucus to find their way outside the body through the faeces. If the ascus bursts inside the tissue, the spores remain in the tissue having to complete their destiny there alone. To complete their biological destiny outside the animal body, the spores are for obvious reasons provided with protection and food material which on. the other hand, are not required by those that are destined to complete their life-history in the tissue, where protection and food are provided for by the host tissue. It is interesting to note that the author found in the nasal discharge only the large type of spores each having proteinacious granules and a capsule. Other workers with material obtained from human patients, particularly Allen and Dave [1936] have recorded the presence of only the large spores in the nasal discharge which is diagnostic of the infestation. Ashworth [1923] and Karunaratne [1936] said that the smallest developing trophozoite in the tissue measure
M. ANANT NARAYAN RAO 193 about six to seven microns and there are no proteinacious granules present in it which, they think, were utilised for building up the cyst wall. It is not clear why they should think that in the host tissue, where food material is available, the spore should utilise its own proteinacious granules and shrink in size only to grow bigger again at the expense of the host. It is doubtful if such a thing happens in nature. Again the size of the young trophozoite is almost that of the small spore found in an ascus and this observation, therefore, suggests that the smaller type of spore alone develops into a trophozoite in the host tissue. The fact that the large spore is provided with proteinacious food granules and is protected with a fairly thick chitinous capsule at once suggests that it is destined to complete its life-history outside the animal body, even as a seed is provided with reserve food material and a testa. Beatty [1906] considered that the " spore morulae " which are protected by their envelopes may undergo changes outside the body. Some workers are of opinion that the small spores in an ascus are degenerate forms, but a careful examination of such spores shows that each has a nucleus and proto- plasm, the staining reactions of which do not suggest degeneration. Hence it would appear that they really are living spores destined to continue the parasi tic development in the tissue of the host, and the large spores are destined to complete their biological destiny outside the animal body. 10. ATTEMPTS TO CULTURE RHINOSPORIDIUM Ashworth [1923] concluded that Rhinosporidium is a fungus and placed it among the Phycomycetes and this has been accepted by Ramsbottam [1931]. Dodge [1936] quotes Wernicke [1907] and places it among the Coccidioideaceae. Excepting for a partial success of Rettle, quoted by Ashworth, no one seems to have succeeded in cultivating the organism on artificial media in the labora- tory. The fact of the difficulty experienced in cultivating that fungus indicates the delicate nature of the oraganism. This feature is further supported by the fact that cases of Rhinosporidium are few and far between being localised only to certain areas as far as could be gathered from the published records. It is apparent that the very first case of rhinosporidiosis could have occurred only from a pre-existing fungus outside the animal body. Further, indigenous cases of rhinosporidiosis have been reported from countries very widely sepa- rated from one another, viz., India, Union of South Africa, Philippine Is. and South America, etc., and for obvious reasons such cases could have received the infection only from a pre-existing saprophytic form of the fungus in those localities. Again it is interesting to note that in India rhinosporidiosis is usually found in the agricultural class of people and in cattle. This fact sug- gested to the author that in nature a saprophytic form of the fungus probably germinates and thrives in bovine dung since bovines swallow their nasal dis- charges and with them the spores of Rhinosporidium when the lesions are in the nose. The possibility of the large spores being destined for a phase of life outside the body of the animal has been discussed above. With this idea in view, a diseased animal was obtained by the author from Tanjore for experi- mental purposes. This animal had a very small growth, about the size of a
194 Rhinosporidiosis in Bovines pea, on the margin of the hole in the septum of the left nostril. Pellets of faeces from that animal were distributed in sterile petri-dishes and kept at room temperature, and also at 37°C, for varying periods to study the fungi developing in them. The study was continued, for a period of over four months and the number of different kinds of fungi obtained during the period was so great as to render it overwhelmingly difficult to cope with the work of identify- ing them. This method was given up in preference to the direct method of planting, on sterile dung, small pieces of growth or the asci obtained by teasing pieces of growth. This method proved to be encouraging since it was found possible to obtain the same kind of fungus in a series of experimental cultures while the best growth was obtained invariably at the room temperature. These cultural experiments were extended to material obtained from human beings and again a fungus resembling the one in cultures of bovine material, was obtained every time. A number of asci, obtained from teased pieces of growths, were treated with five per cent formalin for three minutes, washed in several changes of sterile normal saline and sown on sterile cow dung. These germi- nated quite satisfactorily though slowly. Once the fungus appeared on the dung, there was little difficulty in obtaining sub-cultures on Sabaraud's medium with dung juice in it. The best medium for sub-culture was found to be horse- dung-agar with gland juice smeared over it or added to it. The growth on the latter appeared to be more vigorous than on any other media. On sterile dung it took nearly two weeks to show a white globular fluffy growth. It was interesting to watch the growth in a single ascus planted on dung. In about a week after planting, the wall of the ascus turned dark in colour and a few small, white, ascicular projections appeared round about the ascus at its point of contact with the dung. In about a fortnight the whole ascus looked like a fluffy ball of white wool about the size of a mustard seed. At the end of four weeks it was about the size of a millet seed but flattened showing a few beads of moisture on the surface. In about six weeks a number of small grape-like rounded white bodies appeared on the surface and micros- copic examination showed that these were composed of a thick felted mass of mycelia and no fructification had occurred. The fungus has been sent to experts for identification and the report is awaited. The fungus obtained from the culture has been implanted into the punctured hole of the nasal septum in a bull-calf and the result is awaited. The description of the fungus and the result of animal inoculation will, it is hoped, form the subject of another paper. 11. PROBABLE MODES OF INFECTION Ashworth [1923] refers to direct transmission of the discharged spores from the lesions of Rhinosporidium as an obvious method of spread from man to man, but such direct transmission of the disease has failed in the hands of workers who used laboratory animals for the purpose. There is evidence to show that personal contact even for a number of years does not result in trans- mission. A good example of failure of direct transmission, by such personal contact, is the one reported by Kurup [1931] of a man, with lesions in his
M. ANANT NARAYAN RAO 195 pharynx, living with his wife and family for a period of over eight years without infecting any one of them. The present author has repeatedly failed to trans- mit the disease directly, with the spores from the lesions of diseased bovines, to healthy bovines or laboratory animals. Hence it would appear that in nature direct infection with large spores from the lesion does not take place. If the discharged spores obtained from the parasitic stage of Rhinosporidium are not infective, the only other alternative is to admit the existence of a sap- rophytic form of the fungus whose spores are infective. It would be interesting to examine this question of the existence of Rhinos- poridium outside the animal body as a saprophyte. An analysis of the pub- lished reports on the disease by workers in India,196 Rhinosporidiosis in Bovines get arrested in the mucus present in the nose of man or animals, and under favourable circumstances attack the nasal mucous membrane and produce lesions. Man has also got the habit of swallowing a part of his nasal discharge particularly when it reaches the posterior nares and if one has rhinosporidial lesion in his nose, he will swallow spores along with the nasal discharge. Such spores naturally pass out through faeces. In villages, people defaecate on the fields or other defaecating areas near tanks, nullahs, etc. Further, some people have the habit of blowing their noses so as to throw the nasal discharge on the ground and with it spores will also be thrown out if that person has nasal lesions. Some of those spores, whether in the faeces or in the nasal discharge, may germinate into the saprophytic infective forms, given the time, optimum temperature and moisture. Those may be primary or addition- al sources from which the infective material is disseminated through dust or through stagnant water to which surface washings from infected areas gain access during the rains. (It is probable that soiled fingers also carry the infection to the nose, eye, etc., in the human being). (b) Is the Infective material water-borne ? Mandlik [1937] observes that rhinosporidial infection in Poona and its neighbourhood is localised to areas divisible into groups and that the infection in these groups is localised to in- fected water of certain wells, tanks or infected sections in the river course. He holds that the spores protected with the stout chitinoid envelopes, escape with the nasal discharge into the water of tanks or pools when bathers with rhinosporidial lesions swim in them and those spores infect later some of the unlucky persons that swim or dive in such water. In other words, according to Mandlik, the infection is direct, and direct transmission with such spores has been negatived by experimental evidence. Hence the water should have become infective in some other way. It has been pointed out above that surface washings, and along with them spores of the saprophytic form of the fungus may gain entrance to more or less stagnant water of tanks, wells, etc., from arable lands or defaecation areas. Mandlik [1937] says that the tanks, etc., which he found infective are subject to inundation during rains. Hence it is reasonable to suppose that tanks, etc., may receive infective material from surface washings. Thus, it would appear that infection through dust and water can well be explained if the existence of a saprophytic form of the fungus is admitted, the supposition of which is not unreasonable, since direct infection with spores from the lesion is not possible. 12. SUMMARY 1. Nineteen cases of rhinosporidiosis in the nose of animals, consisting of eighteen bullocks and one pony are now recorded in addition to four animals recorded by Ayyar. 2. Rhinosporidiosis in a pony in the Northern Circars is recorded for the first time.

M. ANANT NARAYAN RAO 197 3. It is observed that the disease is prevalent both in man and animals in certain districts of the Madras Presidency. 4. The organism causing the lesions in man and bovines is probably identical. 5. In cows, as in women, the disease is rarely found, but in men and bul- locks that take part in ploughing, the incidence of the disease is high. 6. The probability of the existence of a saprophytic form of the fungus is suggested and discussed. 7. The possibility of dust and water being the medium through which infection may be carried to healthy individuals is discussed. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I am indebted to Mr. P. T.

STUDIES ON A NATURAL OUTBREAK OF PIGEON-POX BY R. L. KAURA, B.V.Sc., M.R.C.V.S. Offg. Veterinary Research Officer, in-charge Serology AND S. GANAPATHY IYER, G.M.V.C. Veterinary Inspector Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar-Kumaun (Received for publication on 2nd March 1938) (With Plates IX and X) INTRODUCTION THERE are few authentic records of the occurrence of bird pox in India. Since 1934 suspected cases have been examined at this Institute and it is now possible to state that the disease is a menace to the poultry industry. Apparently pigeon-pox has not been described in India, and this paper re- cords the only outbreak that has come to our notice. In April, 1936, spontaneous cases of what later proved to be pigeon-pox occurred among the healthy stock of pigeons at this Institute. We had then fifty-eight pigeons of which twenty-eight were isolated as sick and kept under close observation for study. Six pigeons died and the rest recovered. Previous to the occurrence of this outbreak, studies on pigeon-pox and fowl-pox with reference to their propagation in vivo, the preparation of a vac- cine from the pigeon-pox virus for use against fowl-pox and routine diagnostic work on the specimens suspected for fowl-pox were in progress and are being continued. The seed materials for our stock strains of fowl-pox and pigeon- pox viruses were obtained in 1934 through the courtesy of the Veterinary Laboratory, Ministry of Agriculture, Weybridge, England, and an Indian strain of fowl-pox was later added in 1936. Marx and Sticker [1902] found that the causative agent of pigeon-pox in a natural case was a filterable virus which could be successfully passaged through pigeons but when passaged through the fowl, it became attenuated for the pigeon even after the first passage. M'Fadyean [1908] reported that in outbreaks of ' epithelioma contagiosum ' various species of domesticated poultry and pigeons were affected. Dean and Marshall [1909] confirmed the filtrability of the causative virus in a natural outbreak of ' pigeon diphtheria '. Jowett [1909] considered that the bird-pox virus would adapt itself to the particular species of birds in which it might have become implanted, losing its power to infect any of the other species. Haring and Kofoid. [1911-12] reported, that fowls could be infected with pigeon-pox and the sera of such infected fowls could fix the complement to a greater extent than that of normal (199)
200 Studies on a Natural Outbreak of Pigeon-Pox fowls, using extracts of liver or the lesion of the infected fowl as the antigen. Hutyra and Marek [1926] reported that continued passages of pigeon-pox through fowls attenuated the virus to an extent of avirulency. Ward and Gallagher [1926] mentioned that pox could be readily transmitted from pigeon to the fowl but great difficulty was experienced in attempting the reverse transmission. Doyle and Minett [1927] showed that the virus of fowl- pox and pigeon-pox were immunologically indistinguishable but they differed somewhat in their species adaptation. However, they eventually succeeded in adapting the fowl-pox virus to pigeon's skin through successive passages. Doyle [1930] made a notable addition to the field of immunology by show- ing that pigeon-pox virus protected fowls against subsequent infection with fowl-pox virus but he was unable to demonstrate any neutralizing antibodies in the sera of the immunized birds. He also observed that the virulence of pigeon-pox virus for the fowl could be increased by passage through fowls finally acquiring all the characters of fowl-pox virus. Various other workers, Findlay [1930], Brandly and Bushnell [1932], Canham [1932], Burnet [1933] and Irons [1934] have also worked on this disease and their results have been almost similar to those of Doyle and Minett [1927] and Doyle [1930]. The results obtained by Michael [1932] and Johnson [1935] with the use of gly- cerinated pigeon-pox virus as a vaccine against fowl-pox, however, were not quite in agreement with those of Doyle [1930]. CLINICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE NATURALLY AFFECTED PIGEONS The affected pigeons were dull with ruffled feathers. Their appetite in some cases was impaired. Fever was present in some of the birds prior to the onset of lesions. Wart-like small pea-sized nodular growths attached to the skin over the eyelids, cheesy diphtheritic lesions in the buccal cavity (Plate IX, Figs. 1 and 2), varying degree of conjunctivitis and marked reduc- tion of the body weight characterised the disease. Signs of gastro-enteritis with greenish liquid faeces soiling the feathers beneath the cloaca were seen on autopsy. Mortality was 21.4 per cent. In most of the cases lesions dis- appeared and birds recovered after about three or four weeks. The period of incubation in spontaneous cases could not be determined but in artificially infected birds it varied from two to five days. METHOD OF EXPERIMENTAL TRANSMISSION The material used for experimental transmission of the disease consisted of the cutaneous lesions from the eyelids of the affected pigeons, gently re- moved with a pair of forceps and desiccated in vacuo over phosphoric anhy- dride using a negative pressure of about 30 cm. of mercury. The period of drying lasted for about eighteen hours. The crusts when dried were pul- verised with a pestle and mortar and allowed to soak in a little normal saline solution for an hour. More saline was added to make a homogenous emul- sion with a final concentration of one per cent. It was inoculated over the feather follicles of a leg after pulling out a few feathers, by gentle application with a camel hair brush or a cotton wool swab.

R. L. KAURA and S. GANAPATHY IYER 201 Material from the buccal lesions has not been used for subinoculation purpose because it has been established in another paper by the authors [1936] that in an identical condition in Indian fowls the causal agent of the buccal diphtheritic lesions and the cutaneous lesions is one and the same filterable virus. TRANSMISSION EXPERIMENTS (a) Experimental transmission of the disease in pigeons.202 Studies on a Natural Outbreak of Pigeon -Pox TABLE IR. L. KAURA and S. GANAPATHY IYER 203 (Table II). There was only a transient local congestion of the feather folli- cles. Although the reaction was not very suggestive of successful trans- mission of the disease from pigeons to the fowls, yet, their subsequent immunity test against fowl-pox virus showed that they had developed the immunity. Doyle and Minett [1927], Findlay [1930] and Irons [1934] obtained similar results by the inoculation of fowls with pigeon-pox virus. Two control fowls Nos. 56 and 57 were inoculated with fowl-pox virus alone. They reacted typically unlike the three fowls that received the Indian strain of pigeon-pox virus previously. Four more fowls that were inoculated with the Indian, strain of pigeon- pox virus from Pigeon No. 3, (Table I) on 13th June 1936, were tested with our stock fowl-pox virus, along with two healthy controls on 25th June 1936 (Table II). All the fowls that received a dose of the Indian strain of pigeon- pox virus reacted mildly to it and later resisted the test dose of fowl-pox virus which produced the disease in the two healthy controls. This showed that the Indian strain of pigeon-pox virus, like the English strain of the same virus, can be used as a live vaccine against fowl-pox.

The filtration was done under negative pressure at 56 cm. of mercury and it took about thirty minutes to deliver about 25 c.c. of the filtrate. The filtrate, as ob- tained above, was tested for bacterial sterility and was found to be sterile. It was swabbed over the feather follicles of five healthy pigeons (Table III). Five more pigeons were then inoculated with the unfiltered emulsion to serve as controls. Four out of the five pigeons inoculated with the filtrate reacted typically and in one, Pigeon No. 38, there was no reaction. Out of the five control pigeons, inoculated with the unfiltered material, four reacted and one was found to be resistant.

Pigeon No. 344 re- sisted both the strains and was, therefore, naturally immune to this infection, whereas, the other four pigeons reacted typically to the Indian strain of the virus which suggested that there was some immunological difference between the two strains (Plate X, Figs. 1 and 2). Four more pigeons, after recovery from experimental infection with the English strain of pigeon-pox virus were submitted to immunity test against the Indian strain of the same virus on 12th May 1936 (Table IV). Of these, three pigeons showed no reaction but the fourth one, No. 35, reacted mildly. Since the results of the above two experiments were not similar, a fresh lot of four pigeons which were previously infected with the English strain of pigeon-pox virus were tested with the Indian strain of the same virus on 23rd May 1936 (Table IV). Pigeon No. 12 died three days after the cross inoculations due to other causes and the other three proved refractory. In continuation of this work seventeen more pigeons, actively immune to the English strain of pigeon-pox, were inoculated with the Indian strain of the same virus on 13th July 1936. Of these, fifteen pigeons reacted and the remaining two showed no reaction. From the results of the above experiments it appears that cross immunity does not always exist between the English and the Indian strains of pigeon- pox virus and there seems to exist some difference in the antigenic complex of the two strains.

GANAPATHY IYER 211 SUMMARY A natural outbreak of pigeon-pox occurred in a stock of healthy pigeons at the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar and the source of infection was not traceable. The causative agent was demonstrated to be a filterable virus and has been maintained by passage through pigeons. This appears to be the first recorded outbreak in India. Immunological tests of the virus isolated, indicate certain degree of anti- genic variation from the English strain of pigeon-pox virus although both are similar on grounds of pathogenicity and their capability to protect fowls against fowl-pox. Preliminary complement fixation tests showed that complement fixing bodies were rarely demonstrable in the sera of healthy as well as pigeon-pox immune birds.

A NEW TREMATODE 214 Prosthogonimus indicus in Indian Fowls mounts the parasite measures 4.84H. D. SRIVASTAVA 215 The genus contains a large number of species216 Prosthogonimus indicus in Indian Fowls of its vitellaria which do not extend in front of the acetabulum. P. fuel- leborni differs from P. indicus in the much smaller size of the body (2.28× 1.17 mm.) and the anterior extent of vitellaria which do not reach even the middle of acetabulum. P. longus-morbificans differs from the new species in the relative size of the acetabulum, which is one and a half times the size of the oral sucker, and the posterior extent of the cirrus sac which reaches the acetabulum. From P. querquedulae our species can be easily distinguished by the posterior extent of the cirrus sac, which stops far in front of the acetabulum, the topography of gonads, length of excretory bladder and the extent of vitellaria. In the size ratio of its suckers (oral sucker 0.63 × 0.73; acetabulum 0.87 in diameter), extremely small length of its oesophagus, posterior extent of cirrus sac, which reaches the acetabulum, and the post-acetabular and the restricted extent of the vite- llaria P. leei differs remarkably from the species described in this paper. PROSTHOGONIMIASIS This trematode disease, which is caused by the infestation with members of the genus Prosthogonimus, offers a poultry problem of the highest magni- tude specially in low-lying and water-logged areas. It occurs in a large number of different species of birds and affects only the female. Amongst the domes- tic birds the disease has been reported from fowls, turkeys, geese and ducks. Though its effects have been observed for centuries by farmers in Europe, who were well acquainted with the symptoms and had even associated them with the extensive flights of dragonflies in certain seasons and in spite of the finding of these flukes in small numbers in the oviducts of diseased birds, no patho- logical significance, as has been the case with several other helminthic diseases, was attached to the presence of these parasites. In 1920, Thienemann observ- ed the correlation between the extensive flights of the dragonflyH. D. SRIVASTAVA 217 serious poultry disease in the United States of America was caused by a species of the genus Prosthogonimus. The species has since been described as P. macrorchis by Macy [1934], who has worked out the complete life-history of the parasite. He has extended the work of the previous American workers and has shown that the infestation is widely prevalent in the United States. Taylor [1931] pointed out that though there was no record of the occurrence of this disease in Great Britain it was likely to make its appearance sooner or later as members of the genus Prosthogonimus as well as the dragonfly, L. quadrimaculata, were known to occur in the country. The early symptoms of prosthogonimiasis are the laying of soft-shelled eggs and a marked decrease in the egg production. To determine the effect of the infestation with P. macrorchis, Macy [1934], carried out experiments on laying hens. He selected a flock of sixteen white-leghorn hens with known laying records and to eight of them he fed cysts of the parasite obtained from naiads, the other eight birds were kept as controls. During a fixed period of observation he found that the controls laid ten times as many eggs as did the infested birds. The striking fall in egg production was due entirely to P. macrorchis. Thus it would appear that the worms when present even in such small numbers as will not cause death of the bird, can be responsible for enor- mous economic loss to poultry farmers. The parasite usually lives in the bursa fabricii of both male and female birds. In laying birds it enters the oviduct, being probably assisted by the movements of that organ, and is responsible for causing acute inflammation and the consequent production of abnormal eggs and discharge of albumen. Owing to irritation retroperistaltic movements are set up in the oviduct causing broken yolk, albumen, bacteria and parasite material to enter the peritoneal cavity and giving rise to acute peritonitis. The disease is frequently fatal in even moderate- ly heavy infestations. An interesting, though not serious, aspect of the disease is the occasional occurrence of living parasites and parasite material inside the shell of otherwise normal eggs. This inclusion is possible because the parasite lives on the surface of the oviduct which secretes the egg material. Kolan and Chandler, [1925], noticed the following pathological changes in diseased birds on post mortem examination; heavy emaciation and anæmia ; fibrinous peritonitis, with a large amount of a sticky, yellow exudate containing large masses of egg-yolk and albumen, parasites and its eggs. The ovary showed a number of diseased, collapsed ovules, containing greyish-yellow, egg-yolk-like material mixed with fibrin and pus. The oviduct was greatly distended, its serous coverings showing a more or less pronounced reddish discolouration. The lumen of the oviduct contained a large amount of albu- men material forming ovoid clots of about one to two cm. in diameter ; the mucosa was covered with a sticky exudate consisting mainly of albumen, blood and fibrin; large number of flukes was also present. Bacteriological examinations, both microscopical and cultural, were negative. Bittner [1923], and Macy [1934], found infiltration of large numbers of plasma cells
218 Prosthogonimus indicus in Indian Fowls in the tissues of the diseased oviduct. The former author found large numbers of eosinophiles also but Seifried [1923] and Macy [1934] report the presence of relatively few eosinophiles. The diagnosis of the disease is usually difficult on account of its obscure symptoms, specially in the initial stages. The earlier symptoms, laying of soft-shelled eggs and decrease in egg production, are likely to be attributed to disturbances of the oviduct arising from nutritional irregularities. A positive diagnosis is possible only by the finding of mature parasite or its eggs in the faeces or in the eggs of the suspected bird. It is, however, not always possible to determine the infestation by faecal examination. Seifried [1923], Macy [1934], and others have reported their inability to find eggs in the faeces of infested birds, specially when the infestation was not very heavy, but enough to cause trouble. In the absence of a constant passage of bulky material through the oviduct, the eggs are probably discharged only periodically. In the absence of a positive diagnosis, the following symptoms, when taken collectively, are strongly suggestive of prosthogonimiasis. Inactivity of the bird, sharp decline in egg-production, laying of soft-shelled eggs, presence of chalky-white crust on the feathers around cloacal region, distension of the abdomen in the cloacal region and bluish-red colour of the skin of the abdo- men (advanced cases), presence of hard, cream-coloured chrunks of abortive egg-white and yolk in the oviduct and abdominal cavity and the distended oviduct filled with fibrinated pus and abdominal cavity with pus-exudate, parasites, eggs, lesions and peritonitis. The worms in the oviduct can not be removed by any method of treat- ment. In the early stages, while the parasites are still in the intestine, it may be possible to remove them and thus prevent their entry into the oviduct. Bunyea, Hall and Cram [1933], have reported successful results in the treat- ment of prosthogonimiasis with carbon tetrachloride when given in repeated doses of 1 . 5 to 1 . 7 c.c. in liquid cereal. On account of its toxicity the drug should be used with care. The occurrence of the parasite in migratory birds and the lack of marked host specificity and the migratory nature of its second intermediate host render the problem of prevention extremely difficult. The author understands from Dr. Mehra of the Allahabad University that the Indian snipes are com- monly infested with members of the genus Prosthogonimus. Though the life- history of the Indian species has not yet been worked out, from a comparative study of the life-histories of other species of the genus, it is highly probable that the infestation of poultry with this parasite in this country, as elsewhere, takes place through the young and the adult of dragonflies. The only pos- sible method of preventing the infestation is by keeping poultry fenced away from permanent ponds and lakes. Adult dragonflies are easily caught by poul- try on damp mornings and hence the birds should not be let loose in the mornings until the dragonflies are out of the weeds. The author is deeply grateful to the Director and the Pathologist for their kind encouragement and help.

RHINOSPORIDIOSIS IN EQUINES BY LAKSHMI SAHAI, M.Sc., M.R.C.V.S. (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer, Bihar (Received for publication on 9th April, 1938) (With Plates XIII and XIV) THE first published reference to the occurrence of Rhinosporidiosis in animals in this country is to be found in a paper entitled " Rhinosporidiosis in Cattle " read by the late Krishnamurti Ayyar at the seventh Congress of the Far Eastern Association of Tropical Medicine held in Calcutta in 1927, wherein after reviewing the literature on the subject, he recorded the discovery of the parasite in growths from the nasal cavities of two bullocks and one cow in the Tanjore district of Madras. Up till now this has been the only record of the occurrence of the disease in bullocks either in this country or outside. Later, in 1932, Ayyar described Rhinosporidial growths in a mare which also came from the Tanjore district. Though this was the first case of its kind to be recorded in a horse in India, the parasite had been described earlier in a horse, by Zschokke [1913] in growths sent to him from South Africa. The growth from the nasal cavity in which the parasite was found was of the size of an egg, reddish in colour and hard with a rough outer surface and inside it were found cysts which were filled with a parasite which was very closely allied to Rhinosporidium seeberi, the parasite found in man and which Zschokke termed Rhinosporidium equi. In 1926, two further cases were recorded in the same country in mules by Quinlan and de Koch, and in 1928 another in a horse in Mentevedeo by Cordero and Vogeslang, the lesions in all these cases being more or less alike and in the nature of irregular tumour-like masses situated on the nasal mucous membrane. Including the case recorded by Krishnamurti Ayyar, there are on record only five cases of Rhinosporidiosis in equines. The object of this small note is to place on record another case of equine Rhinosporidiosis in a country- bred pony at Bargarh in the Sambalpur district of Orissa. During the author's visit to Bargarh in February, 1937, Veterinary Assist- ant Surgeon Y. K. Viswanathan, in-charge of the local Veterinary Dispensary, showed him a small growth which he had removed from the nasal cavity of a horse. Suspecting that it might be a Rhinosporidial growth, the writer brought it to Patna where the diagnosis was confirmed by histological examina- tion. (221)

LAKSHMI SAHAI 223 In view of the close relationship between Rhinosporidium equi and Rhinos- poridium seeberi, the causal organism of Rhinosporidiosis in man, enquiries were made to ascertain if human Rhinosporidiosis had been recorded in the locality but the author learnt that the Medical Department was not aware of the existence of the disease in Bihar. There is, however, a record of one case of human Rhinosporidiosis in the Patna General Medical Hospital and two in the Cuttack district of Orissa. In view of the fact that the disease has now been shown to exist in this part of the country, besides Madras Presidency, systematic search will probably reveal the existence of the disease in other parts of India also.

RAJAGOPALAN, G.M.V.C. AND V. R. GOPALAKRISHNAN, G.M.V.C. Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar-Kumdun (Received for publication on 25th March 1938) (With Plate XV and one text-figure) CORYNEBACTERIUM EQUI was first described by Magnusson [ 1923 ] as a possible etiological agent in specific pneumonia in foals and he recorded twelve cases of its incidence in a breeding establishment in Sweden. He also conducted experiments which indicated that only equines and pigs were susceptible to infection with the bacillus responsible for pneumonia in foals. Subsequent workers have also reported the occurrence of the disease in equines in other countries ; Meissner and Wetzel [ 1923 ], Lutje [ 1923 ], and Lund [ 1924 ] in Germany ; Bull [ 1924 ] in Australia ; Dimock and Edwards [ 1931 ] in America and Rajagopalan [ 1937 ] in India. This organism has so far been recorded as occurring exclusively in the equine species. The object of this paper is to record the occurrence of an organism indistinguishable from Corynebacterium equi in its morphological, cultural, biochemical and pathological characters in the genital tract of a she-buffalo, the subject of abortion. We are indebted to Mr. Tulsi Ram, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon on special duty at Okara, for the material from the she-buffalo. The material was received as swabs taken from the os uteri. The following history was supplied with the material: "Buffalo No. 92/4-3 in first calving226 Corynebacterium equi in a She-Buffalo THE IDENTITY OF THE ORGANISM Morphology.V. R. RAJAGOPALAN and V. R.

V. R. RAJAGOPALAN and V. R. GOPALAKRISHNAN 231 It will be seen that the foal pneumonia organism fixes complement in the presence of the buffalo-diphtheroid-serum at about the same titre as in the presence of its homologous serum and vice versa. PATHOGENICITY The organism was found to be non-pathogenic to rabbits and guinea-pigs. With a view to ascertain the pathogenicity of the organism for young equines, Foal No. 417, aged fourteen days was swabbed inside both nostrils with an emulsion of the buffalo strain of diphtheroid. The animal behaved exactly like a foal infected with C . equi (Text-fig. 1). It showed a distinct rise in temperature on the evening of the sixth day. The animal was dull and lacking in appetite. It had an occasional cough and became progressively weak. The respiration was distressed and gurgling noises could be heard on auscultation of the lungs. The temperature continued to be high until just before death when there was a slight fall. The foal died on the sixteenth day after infection. A post mortem examination, the anterior portion of both the main lobes of the lungs were found studded with characteristic abscesses (Plate XV). An organism indistinguishable from C. equi was re-isolated from the lung abscesses in pure culture. Whether the organism is capable of causing abortion or purulent metritis in she-buffaloes under experimental conditions could not be determined owing to lack of pregnant she-buffaloes. In the hope that a pregnant cow might react in a similar way, Cow No. 5, nine months pregnant, was instilled intra- vaginally with five c.c. of a saline emulsion of the organism made from four 48-hrs. old agar slants, combined with an oral administration of an equal quantity of a similar emulsion. Twelve days later the cow gave birth to a calf which died soon after birth. The organism could not be recovered from the uterine discharges of the cow, nor from, any of the internal organs of the dead calf. Another experiment was conducted to find whether this organism could cause pneumonia or joint-ill in bull-calves, in the same way as C . equi does in young equines. Two calves, aged two to three months, were swabbed in both nostrils with an emulsion of the organism. No lesions attributable to in- fection with C. equi developed in either of them.

V. R. RAJAGOPALAN and V. R. GOPALAKRISHNAN 233 DISCUSSION From the cultural and biochemical characters of the organism coupled with its serological affinity to C. equi and pathogenicity to young foals, there remains no doubt the organism under consideration is a strain of C. equi. This is the first time that the organism has been recorded in a species other than equine. It was isolated from the uterus of a she-buffalo that had aborted. Following abortion there was a foetid purulent slimy discharge from the uterus and the organism was obtained from this discharge. The only other organism that was grown besides C . equi was a coliform organism and the question naturally arises why the latter should not be held as the cause of the condition. It is true that certain strains of coliform organisms are capable of causing inflammatory conditions of the urinogenital tract of man and animals. Such strains are highly virulent for the guinea-pig and mice, causing, on fresh isolation, by intraperitoneal inoculation, a suppura- tive or purulent peritonitis or a fatal septicaemia. But in this case, guinea- pigs and mice that had received intraperitoneal injections of the material developed no illness, and on destruction revealed no pyogenic lesions. It would appear, therefore, that the coliform organism was a banal organism devoid of pathogenic properties. There is, therefore, the probability that the pyogenic lesions met with in the buffalo were due to the other organism isolated namely C. equi. This organism is non-pathogenic to laboratory animals, which fact should explain why the guinea-pigs and mice inoculated with the purulent material from the buffalo containing the diphtheroid deve- loped no lesions. But the mere isolation of an organism from lesions does not definitely establish it as the pathogen. Lesions similar to those in the buffalo could not be induced in a pregnant cow by the intravaginal instillation of the isolated organism. Owing to lack of pregnant buffaloes, the pathogenicity of the organism to the species from which it was isolated could not be tried under experimental conditions. It has not been possible, therefore, to advance experimental evidence definitely incriminating this organism as the cause of either post-abortion purulent metritis or of abortion although the cir- cumstances of the case under report are strongly suggestive of its being the cause of one or both. However, irrespective of its pathogenic significance, the mere occurrence, in the buffalo, of Corynebacterium equi, an organism which has so far been naturally met with exclusively in the equine species, is of sufficient interest and is deserving of report. SUMMARY Corynebacterium equi has been recognised by several workers as a cause of pneumonia in young equines. It has not so far been recognised as occurring in any other species of animals. Its occurrence in pyometra following abortion in a she-buffalo is, therefore, recorded in this article. Its identity with Cory- nebacterium equi has been proved by morphological, cultural, biochemical,
234 Corynebacterium equi in a She-Buffalo serological and biological tests. The probability of its being an etiological factor of either abortion or of post-abortion pyometra is discussed.

PSEUDANOPLOCEPHALA CRAWFORDI BAYLIS, 1927. BY S. VAITHIANATHA MUDALIAR, G. M. V. C. Assistant Lecturer, Madras Veterinary College AND K. S. GOPALAKRISHNA IYER, G. M. V. C. Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Madras Veterinary College. (Received for publication on 30th March 1938.) [With Plate XVI and two text-figures.] INCIDENCE of adult cestodes in the pig appears to be very limited. The cases on record so far are by Maplestone and Southwell [1923], Baylis [1927] and Hall [1924]. Maplestone and Southwell [1923] described Paramoniezia suis from an Australian wild pig. Baylis [1927] described Paramoniezia pha- cochaeri from an African wart hog and Pseudanoplocephala crawfordi obtained from a wild pig in Ceylon. Hall [1924] appears to have recorded an undeter- mined Anoplocephalid tapeworm in a pig in America. It is thus seen that no adult tapeworms have so far been reported from India and hence this record of a tapeworm from this part of India. In the last week of December 1937, a col- lection of helminths of the pig was made by the writers and the worm to be described belongs to that collection. In the museum of parasitological collec- tions of this College, about half a dozen specimens of tapeworms from the pig collected by M. Anant Narayan Rao and L. S. Parameshwara Iyer during 1932 and awaiting identification were also examined. All the specimens resemble, in almost all details, the parasite P. crawfordi Baylis, 1927. A description of the parasites is given below : The worms measure from 21 to 31 cm. in length and 3 to 4 mm. in width. The segments are wider than long in the anterior portion while there is a tendency to an increase in the length at the posterior end of the strobila. The gravid segments are very much contracted.

THE OCCURRENCE OF GAPEWORM IN FOWLS BY HAR DAYAL SRIVASTAVA, D.Sc. Helminthologist (On special duty) Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar-Kumaun (Received for publication on 25th May 1938) THE terms gapeworms, y-worms and forked-worms are applied to a genus of strongyle nematodes240 Occurrence of Gapeworm in Fowls hatch and infection may result by the ingestion of eggs containing fully deve- loped larvae. Although the intercalation of an invertebrate intermediate host, such as earthworms, snails and slugs, in the life-cycle of this parasite is not necessary, they often act as reservoirs for the larvae. When larvae and mature eggs are ingested along with soil by earthworms they migrate from the gut to their muscular parts and remain alive there for over three years. The earthworm thus plays an important role in the collection of larvae from the soil, in carrying over the infection from season to season and in transferring them to the final host. On being swallowed by the final host, the larvae quickly migrate to the lungs where they undergo a further moult and sex differentiation and pairing take place. After pairing the worms leave the smaller air-passages and work their way to the large windpipes. Sexual maturity is attained in ten to fourteen days after the worms reach the trachea. The entire life-cycle is completed in a month or so. The worms inhabit the trachea and bronchi of the turkey, fowl, pheasant goose, duck, pigeon, guinea-fowl, pea-fowl, partridge and various species of other birds. Chicks, turkey poults and young pheasants are particularly sus- ceptible and may die in large numbers. However, chickens invariably develop a very definite immunity when eight or nine weeks old, and once this age immunity develops any worms which may be present die and a reinfec- tion is impossible. The turkey on the other hand does not develop any age immunity and may remain infested throughout. Turkeys do not show any symptoms, unless very heavily infested, and hence may serve as carriers for the parasite. The ' gape ' disease in young birds is probably mainly due to the mechani- cal blockage of the trachea, which is brought about by the presence of the para- site, local oedema of the mucosa at the seat of attachment and the accumula- tion of mucus. The migration of the larvae through the lungs does not appear to have any serious effect. Though the worms are blood suckers, the actual loss of blood is probably negligible. The symptoms are mainly those of suffocation. There is a peculiar cough or sneeze, the bird tosses its head, the neck is stretched forward with open beak in an attempt to take in more air. The death is usually due to suffocation though progressive emaciation is undoubtedly a contributory factor. In the absence of any satisfactory treatment the practice of mechanically dislodging the worm, with or without the aid of certain chemicals, is wide- spread. A loop of horse hair is introduced into the trachea, twisted to entangle the worms and then withdrawn. The tip of a feather moistened with clove oil or turpentine is also often used in dislodging the parasite. In the case of valuable birds intratracheal injection of 1 c.c. Lugol's iodine or five per cent aqueous salicylic acid may be tried. Fumigation with such substances as heated carbolic acid, tobacco smoke or burning sulphur is of little value and may even be dangerous. Sodium salicylate at the rate of three drams to every quart of drinking water or pounded garlic in the proportion of one bulb per day added to the food of ten birds may result in the expulsion of the worms.
H. D. SRIVASTAVA 241 Prevention is much more important than treatment. Infested birds should be killed and the heads, respiratory and digestive organs burnt. Chickens acquire infection from turkeys, wild birds or from eggs and larvae carried over in the soil from previous infection. For about four to six weeks chicks should be raised on board floors and the droppings should be removed at regular intervals. They should never be kept on the same ground with turkeys. Moist localities where earthworms are likely to occur should be avoided. New chicks should be purchased out of clean flocks and quarantined. Infection from wild birds should be avoided. In this country snipes are sus- pected to serve as carriers. The author is grateful to the Director and the Pathologist for much kind encouragement. REFERENCES Baylis, H. A. (1936).

Veterinary Investigation Officer, Bombay Province (Received for publication on 28th May 1938) (With two text-figures.) ANTHRAX is a disease of great economic importance as it is enzootic in various parts of India and is responsible, during certain seasons, for heavy losses chiefly among horses, cattle, sheep and goats. It is also of importance in comparative medicine as it is transmissible to human beings through handl- ing of infected materials. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Fig. 1244 Anthrax Infection Through Dirty Stagnant Pools curve (Fig. 1) during certain years, the cause of which is still unknown. It is prevalent throughout the year causing heavy mortality from April to Sep- tember and in the month of December (Fig. 2). In this connection, it would be interesting to note that as an infection in the soil it is quite natural for Anthrax to break out in an epizootic form during the grazing season which, in most of the districts, begins from the latter half of June. The source of infection during the months of April and May, when practically no grazing is available, has, however, remained a mystery. It is not uncommon to find stall-fed draught animals also succumbing to Anthrax during the summer season and here again the source of infection was unknown. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Fig. 2R. N. NAIK 245 This, it would appear, is a very important finding in the epizootiology of Anthrax, inasmuch as water from stagnant pools has been proved to be the source of natural infection of the disease perhaps for the first time in India and that it will now be possible to check the occurrence of the disease especially during summer by adopting suitable preventive measures.

Farbrother, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Director of Veterinary Services, Bombay Province, Poona under whose guidance this work has been carried out.

Sc. Helminthologist (On special duty) Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar-Kumaun (Received for publication on 25th May 1938.) RAILLIET AND HENRY in a paper on the classification of the genus Oncho- cerca Diesing [1841], published in 1910 established a new species, O. cervicalis, which according to them was very common in France. Subsequently this nematode, which is commonly known as the neck threadworm, has been re- ported from equines in several countries,250 Occurrence of an Unrecorded Filarid Nematode in India The life-history of O. cervicalis has been worked out by Steward [1933]. It has been demonstrated that certain biting flies, Culicoides nebeculosus, commonly known as midges, serve as the intermediate host of the parasite. The midges take up the larval worms in the course of piercing the skin of infected horses and, after a period of twenty-four to twenty-five days, the infected midges contain larvae capable of infecting the final host. No treatment for the destruction of the worms in the Ligamentum nuchae is known, and it is obviously difficult to prevent horses from being attacked by midges in localities where they occur. The avoidance of swampy pas- tures, however, may be beneficial in controlling the parasite.

Lecturer in Parasitology, Madras Veterinary College, Madras (Received for publication on the 16th June 1938) (With Plate XVIII and one text-figure) SIX years ago, a piece of liver from a hare, Lepus nigricollis, containing a number of filariid worms was received from Tiruvannamalai, North Arcoe district. The worms were in a clot of blood in the portal vein. Only somt female worms were available for study then and because they resembled, to a very great extent, the females of Micipsella numidica [Seurat, 1917], they were recorded as such in the Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, Madras, 1932-33. It has now been possible to obtain some male worms and a detailed study of these has shown some important differences between these and the ones described by Seurat. Seurat [1917] described Filaria numidica which he obtained from the peritoneal cavity of Lepus species. In 1921, he created a new genus Micipsella to receive those worms and renamed them Micipsella numidica. Kalantarian [1924] described similar worms from rodents in Armenia and named them Cercofilaria numidica which, according to Yorke and Maplestone [1926], are synonymous with M. numidica. From the literature available, it would appear that so far only one species has been described. A description of the male and female worms, obtained from the portal vein of the hare, is given below.

ANANT NARAYAN RAO 253 TABLE ITHE OCCURRENCE OF PARAGONIMUS WESTERMANI IN THE LUNGS OF CATS IN INDIA BY HAR DAYAL SRIVASTAVA, D.Sc. Helminthologist (On special duty) Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar-Kumaun (Received for publication on 25th May 1938.) THE lung fluke of mammals256 Paragonimus westermani in the Lungs of Cats imported case of paragonimiasis in a Chinaman in Bombay. The only re- cord of the occurrence of this parasite in domestic animals in this country is by Rao [1935] who found two dogs in the Madras Presidency harbouring the parasite in their lungs. During the routine post mortem examination, the author recovered a pair of flukes from a cyst in the lungs of a cat, which on examination proved to be specimens of P. westermani. This is the first record of the occurrence of lung flukes in Indian cats. Usually the parasite occurs encysted in pairs, specially in animals. The eggs are laid in the cysts and escape through the connecting channels into the bronchi, or else when the cysts rupture. They are either voided with the sputum or are swallowed with it and passed out with the faeces. Under suitable conditions of temperature and mois- ture they hatch in four to seven weeks. The actively swimming miracidia on coming in contact with a suitable molluscan host penetrate into its soft tissues. Inside the body of the snail they undergo further development into sporocyst, rediae and cercariae. The cercariae are microcercous, with an elliptical body and short, knob-like caudal append- age. On emerging from the snail these larvae swim about and if a crayfish or a suitable crab be available, penetrate into their soft parts and encyst. The final host acquires infection usually through eating the second intermediate host harbouring metacercariae. Another possible, though not common, mode of acquiring infection is by swallowing free, viable cysts in drinking water. The cysts remain viable in running water for at least twenty-five days. It is quite easy to surmise that, under natural conditions, cysts could be freed from decomposing crayfishes in situations accessible to the final hosts. The adolescaria emerges from the cyst in the duodenum of the final host. It penetrates through the wall of the intestine, traverses the abdominal cavity and migrates upwards through the diaphragm into the thoracic cavity, where it penetrates through the pleura into the lungs and finally arrives in the bronchioles. In the lungs it becomes encysted and attains sexual maturity. Though the normal habitat of the parasite is the lungs, it is not infre- quently generalised in its distribution in the whole body, being found in the liver, intestinal wall, mesenteric glands, muscles, testes, brain, or attached to peritoneum or pleura. It is in these atypical foci that the parasite is most harmful and difficult to detect. Parasitic cysts in the latter situations work their way to mucous or epithelial surfaces, such as the intestinal mucosa, biliary tract epithelium, pleural or peritoneal surfaces, or even skin, in which positions they may form ulcers which heal with difficulty. In one case the author found eggs of this parasite embedded in the cardiac muscles of an Indian dog. No satisfactory treatment is known. Tartar emetic may relieve pulmonary symptoms in human beings, but the parasites in the cysts are not affected.

Sci. 27, 224, 1937.) THE yield of nutrients from hay cut at two different stages of growth, early and ordinary, and losses occurring during the making and stacking were determined. The ordinary hay was cut when the majority of the grasses had flowered and the earlier grasses had shed their seed. The early type was cut some three to five weeks earlier when the majority of the grasses were just coming into flower. The growth which took place on the early hay plots between the times of cutting the early and ordinary hay was also con- sidered in estimating the early hay-yields. The experiments were carried out for five years and sheep were used to determine the digestibility of the fresh grass and hay samples. The average yield data for the five years (1931-35) show that the average production of ordinary hay was 992 lb. more than the early hay including the aftermath. The pro- duction of starch equivalent was greater in the ordinary hay by 249 lb. per acre, but the early hay yielded 47 lb. per acre more protein equivalent. The ordinary hay conserved 522 lb. more starch equivalent and only 11 lb. less protein equivalent than the early hay if the aftermath is excluded. The authors think that the early hay cannot compete with the ordinary hay when the yields of nutrients in the hays alone are considered. The average total losses of dry matter, starch equivalent and protein equivalent in the early hay were 23.2, 41.3 and 32.0 per cent and in the ordinary hay 20.0, 32.0 and 29.4 per cent respectively. The poorer weather conditions at the time of making the early hay probably account for the slightly greater losses suffered by the early hay. Adverse weather conditions caused high losses, the highest losses of D. M., S. E., P. E. being 36.7, 58.7 and 53.7 per cent respectively. The losses during the curing process in the stack were of minor importance compared to the losses in the field. In some cases, the digestible nutrients appear to have increased as a result of the fermentation in the stack. The methods of windrow and tramped heap or pike drying for making " seeds " hay were also compared. Piked hay was slightly more digestible and gave a greater yield of S.E.and P.E. [N. C. D. G.].

THE author describes a small epizootic of meningo-encephalitis among well-nourished mature lambs in a flock of sheep associated with a Listerella-like organism, similar to those reported by Seastone in U.

260 ABSTRACTS A combination of the following symptoms characterised the clinical disease :ABSTRACTS 261 In the initial period there was a marked loss in condition and impairment of appetite but progressive improvement ensued as soon as dicalcium phosphate was introduced in the ration. When, however, dicalcium phosphate was eliminated from the ration, the blood picture indicated a marked phosphorus deficiency and also low values for in- organic P in blood and serum and raised values for calcium and phosphates in the serum. No inappetence was, however, noticed in the experimental animals. The introduction of bone flour at this stage again exerted a corrective influence and the blood picture rapidly returned to normal. The experimental evidence leads to the conclusion that phosphorus supplied in the form of dicalcium phosphate is utilised to an extent approximately 50 per cent greater than when supplied in the form of steamed bone flour, and that dicalcium phosphate added as a supplement to a phosphorus deficient ration appears to exert a more favour- able influence on nitrogen assimilation than does steamed bone flour. The higher actual retention of CaO noticed when steamed bone flour is used as a supplement is due to more CaO supplied by this supplement as compared with dicalcium phosphate. In regard to the percentage retention of the CaO ingested, there is hardly any difference between these two supplements. [H.B.S.] The Cattle of the Gold Coast, J. L. Stewart. (The Emp. J. of Exptl. Agri. Vol. VI, No. 21, 1938, pp. 85-94). IN this interesting article the author gives a comprehensive description of the various types of cattle in the Gold Coast and refers to the system of animal husbandry, the con- templated plans of improvement and associated limiting factors. The present cattle population of the Gold Coast is estimated at nearly 200,000 and of these 160,000 are in the northern territories, nearly 40,000 in the plains of the eastern parts of the Colony and a few scattered herds in other regions. The best cattle are found in the north-east of the northern territories. The distribution of cattle in the different regions of West Africa is correlated with the degree of trypanosomiasis infection and availability of water. Shortage of water has seriously inhibited the development of the cattle industry, but efforts are now being made to remedy this short-coming in all the livestock areas. The origin of the unhumped cattle of West Africa has been traced from three types, the Hamitic Longhorn, the oldest African bovine, the Brachyceros or dwarf shorthorn imported from Asia many centuries ago and the Zebu more recently brought from Asia. The Zebu features are conspicuous in animals in northern territories, whilst in the remote bush areas along the coast shorthorn blood is predominant. The present grading up policy has a particular prejudice in favour of the Hamitic Longhorn type due to its greater resistance to trypanosomiasis and other enzootic diseases as compared with the Zebu. Another excellent type which is highly favoured in the tsetse areas and is nearest to the pure Hamitic Longhorn is the N'Dama breed. It appears to be the most suitable bovine for improvement work in the tsetse areas, as it is the only type in West Africa which can usually stand to the infection of different strains of try- panosomes. N'Dama is probably an admixture of the Zebu and Brachyceros.
262 ABSTRACTS Two types of Zebu are met with in West Africa. There is the white Fulani, a Nigerian type (weighing 8½ to 10 cwt.) originating probably from the fusion of the Zebu proper and the Hamitic Longhorn and the other is the Sudanese or shorthorned Zebu, a result of the fusion of the Zebu and Brachyceros strains. Another type known as Sanga is a cross between humped Zebu and unhumped West African ShorthornNOTES The Maynard-Gangaram Prize APPLICATIONS are invited for the " Maynard-Gangaram Prize " of the value of Rs. 3,000 which will be awarded for a discovery, or an invention, or a new practical method tending to increase agricultural production in the Pun- jab on a paying basis. The prize is open to all, irrespective of caste, creed or nationality and Government servants are also eligible for it. Essays and theses are not eligible for competition and applicants should prove that some part of their discovery, invention etc., is the result of work done after the prize was founded in 1925. The Managing Committee reserves to itself the right of withholding or postponing the prize, if no satisfactory achievement is reported to it. All entries in competition for the next award should reach the Director of Agriculture, Punjab, Lahore, on or before the 31st December, 1938. Prize for Improved Agricultural Implements IN order to encourage inventors to improve existing implements of culti- vation and to design new implements and machines better suited to Punjab conditions and within the power of the average cultivator to purchase, the Punjab Government have decided to institute a scheme of prizes. Each year during the scheme, applications will be invited for a suitable design of particular improved agricultural implement or machine. These prizes will be open to all, irrespective of nationality. Government servants can compete, subject to the consent of the Government under whom they are employed. During the current year a prize of Rs. 3,000 is offered for a suitable de- sign for a bullock-drawn cultivator. The implement must be simple in de- sign ; cheap in cost, so as to be within the purchasing power of an average cul- tivator ; capable of repairs by an average village blacksmith ; efficient in stirr- ing up fallow land quickly after rain or irrigation, in order to conserve the maxi- mum amount of moisture in the soil, and suitable- for the inter-cultivation of crops sown in lines. The cost of manufacturing the cultivator must not exceed Rs. 15. Competitors must submit applications setting forth the advantages claimed for their respective designs and accompanied by scale drawings and specifica- tions which must be sufficiently complete in all details to enable a manufac- turer to make the implement. (263)
264 The applications will be examined by an Expert Committee which will select for manufacture for trial purposes designs which hold promise of sufficient merit. Applicants whose designs are so selected will be required to deliver the implement in complete working order at Lyallpur or elsewhere in the Punjab within one month of receipt of instructions. Actual pocket expenses up to a maximum of Rs. 50 will be allowed. The award of the Committee will be final. The entry, for which the prize is awarded, will become the sole property of the Punjab Government which also reserves the right to postpone or with- hold the award of the prize, if no entry of sufficient merit is received. Applications, complete in all respects, must reach the Director of Agri- culture, Punjab, Lahore, by 31st October, 1938, at latest.

NOTE.ORIGINAL ARTICLES "ACTINOMYCOSIS"* AND ACTINOBACILLOSIS IN ANIMALS IN INDIA 272 "Actinomycosis" and Actinobacillosis in Animals but the prevalence of economically more important diseases and the lack of facilities available to the average veterinarian in India which are standing in the way of such research. The Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Madras Presiden- cy, 1927-28, records the finding of typical " Actinomycosis " in a three months old lesion " in the jaw " of a bullock and the finding of an acid-alcohol-fast Streptothrix in sections of lime-sized growths " in the left shoulder blade " of a buffalo. Datta [1933] has recorded the finding of " Actinomycosis " in a buffalo-heifer in growths " on the parotid glands of both sides ". The specimen referred to by him has been studied further by the author and its description will appear later (p. 278). The Streptothrix has been seen in association with lesions of other diseases of Indian animals and has even been highly suspected as the primary etiolo- gical factor [Datta, 1931 ; Ayyar, 1925]. But, as Datta [1933] has clearly stated, " reports on genuine cases of actinomycosis of animals have been very few indeed ". Apparently he has been able to discover only two such previous reports viz., that of Pease [1891] who described an outbreak amongst buffa- loes in the Punjab, and the one mentioned above from the Civil Veterinary Department, Madras (1927-28). During routine examination of specimens sent to the Pathology Section of this Institute, the author had the good fortune to encounter a few specimens of " Actinomycosis " and became interested in their etiological classification. This necessitated a re-examination of the entire, relevant, catalogued material spread over the last fifteen years. It was realised that in the absence of complete clinical histories of the cases, and also of any cultural material, such a classification was not without risks of contradiction. Nevertheless, it was not considered altogether impossible in all cases. Workers in other countries have explored several etiological factors which may produce structures that are commonly known as " actino-bodies " or " ray-colonies ". The essential feature of these is a peripheral zone of radiat- ing clubs. It must be borne in mind, however, that this essential part of the ray-colony is not necessarily a portion of the etiological organism. Experience [Bostroem, 1890 ; Brumpt, 1906 ; M'Fadyean, 1889 ; Delepine, 1890] has shown that the formation of clubs as a radiating peripheral zone may be brought about as a result of defensive, or according to some [Crookshank, 1888 ; Gibson, 1934 ; Lignieres and Spitz, 1902] offensive mechanism of the organism against the tissue, or as a result of tissue-reaction against the invad- ing parasite. " Christiansen, and others before him, have shown that actino- mycotic formations can be produced by moulds. Other writers have shown them present with tubercle bacilli. Magrou [1919] produced " such formations by inoculating Staphylococci into testicles of guinea-pigs................. "Thus, the mere presence of club-bearing granules is no proof that there is a question of Actinomycosis " [Magnusson, 1928]. Actino-bodies may be met with in several unrelated disease conditions : they occur, for instance, in true actinomycosis, in actinobacillosis, in chronic staphylococcal infection of the
M. Y. MANGRULKAR 273 skin or udder [Albiston and Pullar, 1934], around Streptococci [Albiston and Pullar, 1934], possibly in some Corynebacterial granulomata, around dead tubercle bacilli [Meyer and Mayer, 1927], around worm eggs (Schistosoma) and following intravenous injection of tellurium in oily suspensions [Levaditi and Dimanesco-Nicolau, 1926]. It will be apparent then that for the etiolo- gical agent one has to search under the peripheral zone of the actino-body. The causative organism is situated centrally in the young lesion but in older colonies the most central portion may have undergone degenerative changes, whereas the middle zone shows what can be interpreted as an. active vegetative area of the etiological factor. In some cases the micro-organism may be seen situated just under the peripheral zone or even scattered amongst the bases of the clubs. When one takes these facts into consideration there seems little doubt that with the knowledge of the morphology and staining peculiarities of micro- organisms one could determine the etiology of the actino-body with some de- gree of certainty by comparison with other known granulomata with similar microscopic appearance. Thus the ray-colonies could be etiologically classi- fied without the need, in every case, of a cultural examination. Indeed, speaking of true actinomycosis, Colebrook [1931] asserts that a diagnosis of actinomycosis could thus be given, for in practice " such cultivation is not absolutely necessary because just as in tuberculosis the demonstration of acid- fast bacilli is sufficient for a diagnosis which will be correct ninety-nine times out of a hundred, so in actinomycosis the finding of definite granules visible to the naked eye and composed of Gram-staining mycelium will make it legiti- mate to infer the presence of an infection by Actinomyces bovis ". There is little doubt that a similar view could be taken of other " actinomycotic " conditions, especially, if we consider the works of Griffith [1916], Bosworth [1923] and Magnusson [1928]. This brings us on to the subject of nomenclature to be adopted. The word " actinomycosis " has been in use for a long time and is so closely connected with research in this direction that by constant but loose usage, it continues to designate even to-day the entire group of diseases, characterised by the formation of granules, wherein actino-bodies are found. Various authors [Colebrook, Bosworth, Davies, Magnusson, M'Fadyean] have from time to titme suggested revision of terminology but their suggestions have not been uni- versally adopted, partly on account of the fact that the comprehensive use of the term " actinomycosis " has become firmly established and partly be- cause some of the advocates of revised taxonomy have allowed themselves to adopt the old terminology or have suggested terms which are defective in expression. It is well known that until the discovery of the Actinobacillus by Lig- nieres and Spitz in 1902, the etiological difference between actinomycosis and actinobacillosis was not realised. Bollinger [1877], who was the first to give a scientific account of " actinomycosis ", had before him the diseased jaw- bone as well as tongue and affected lymph glands of the head. Until 1902,
274 "Actinomycosis" and Actinobacillosis in Animals scientific workers believed that all that showed the actino-body was actino- mycosis due to the Gram-positive Streptothrix, and that the same disease attacked the jaw-bone and tongue. In fact, Bollinger had " no doubt that in the mycosis of the jaws, the corresponding lymph glands are similarly affec- ted " [M'Fadyean, 1932]. The description and figures of " actinomycosis " given by nineteenth century authors were correct in so far as the presence of the actino-body was concerned, but they gave little help as to whether the condition depicted was true actinomycosis or actinobacillosis [M'Fadyean, 1932]. Although Wolff and Israel had already cultivated the anaerobic organism of true bovine actinomycosis in 1891, the importance of the discovery of the Actinobacillus was not promptly realised. Wright [1905] in his memoir cast a doubt if there was such a thing as a Gram-negative bacillus capable of causing an " actinomycotic " disease in bovine. Although Nocard [1902] had verified the discovery of Lignieres and Spitz, Wright was anxious to have it confirmed. Further, Schlegel [1928] in Kolle, Kraus and Uhlenhuth's " Handbuch der Pathogenen mikroorganismen ", suggests that the appearance of the actinobacillus results from the method of staining only. With improve- ments in laboratory methods, however, the two etiologically distinct diseases due to the Gram-positive fungus (actinomycosis) and the Gram-negative bacillus (actinobacillosis) are recognised to-day. It may be mentioned here in passing that Actinomyces bovis, the anaero- bic species of Wolff and Israel is the cause of true actinomycosis in animals and in man, and that the aerobic type of actinomyces cultivated earlier in 1890 by Bostroem, and commonly known as A. bostroemi (A. hominis or A. graminis) is recognised to-day by most scientific workers as a mere saprophyte of the soil, having no etiological relationship with true actinomycosis. In spite of the fact that the aerobic organism is known to grow readily on ordinary culture media, Bostroem [1890] could obtain it only in twelve out of 700 tubes inoculated with material from eleven cases of bovine actinomycosis. Further, the orga- nism has failed to infect laboratory animals and cattle. The species of Bost- roem should, therefore, be looked upon as an air contaminant and one may " seriously question the relationship of the aerobic form to the disease actino- mycosis " in man and animals [Henrici, 1930]. Moreover, Colebrook [1921] states that A. bovis is a rather delicate (easily killed by drying), non-sporulat- ing anaerobe which has never been met with outside the host-body, thus being an obligatory parasite. In support of Magnusson's [1928] statement regard- ing actinomycosis in man and animals, Davies [1932] mentions that A. bostroemi has never been isolated from bovine lesions and adds that " It has never yet been shown that A. bovis can lead a saprophytic existence ". As early as the end of the nineteenth century, Crookshank [1888] and Delepine [1890] had sug- gested the marked similarity between the etiological agents of true human and bovine actinomycosis. The same view was emphasized by Wright [1905] and is generally accepted to-day, the organism isolated from different parts of the world being A. bovis [Colebrook, 1931]. The difference noted by older
M. Y. MANGRULKAR 275 authors between the Gram-staining characters of the clubs in human and bovine lesions [Wooldridge, 1907] is no longer recognised. The occurrence of pus formation in the human and its rarity in the bovine lesion is explained by M'Fadyean [1889] on grounds of a host-specific tissue reaction, on analogy with tuberculosis. The failure of Iodine therapy in human actinomycosis [Cole- brook, 1921] is easily explained [M'Fadyean, 1932], because the treatment is a success not against actinomycotic infection but against actinobacillosis in animals. Although the bone does not respond to internal medicinal treat- ment in most infections, success with iodine therapy in some bone lesions of animals may be due to the fact that the infective agent was the bacillus and not the streptothrix. According to M'Fadyean [1932] Actinobacillus is not known to be pathogenic for man and Griffith [1931] states that " there is no authentic record of a human case " ; but Colebrook [1930] cites one case of meningitis stating that it is not impossible that other cases have been over- looked. Also, Beaver and Thompson [1930] refer to two previous cases and describe, in addition, one case of fatal infection. Resuming the subject of nomenclature, a study of the works of Magnusson [1928], Albiston [1930], Albiston and Pullar [1934], and Davies [1935] makes it appear beyond any shadow of doubt that there occurs in the bovine and porcine udders a chronic Staphylococcal granuloma with typical actino-bodies possessing a peripheral zone of radiating clubs. Statistical data tend to show that in the bovine host infection is always of the Staphylococcal type. Al- biston and Pullar [1934] state that of 153 cases of " actinomycotic " mastitis of bovines described from different parts of the world, 151 were due to Sta- phylococcus, one due to Actinobacillus, and one due to an unidentified Strep- tothrix. In the last case " the skin over the udder showed actinomycotic lesion, and the mammary infection was obviously an extension from the skin lesion ". On a number of occasions a pure culture of the staphylococcus (S. pyogenes) has been obtained by various workers from lesions of so-called bo- vine " actinomycotic " mastitis. In one case the culture so obtained has been successfully used by Hulphers [1923] in producing the original disease in a bovine. The success which attended Magrou's experiments [1919] has proved that the Staphylococcus is capable of producing a chronic granuloma closely resembling " actinomycosis ". This then would lead one to recognise a chronic staphylococcal " actinomycosis " of the bovine udder. It must be borne in mind, however, that all chronic cases of staphylococcal infection of the cow's udder do not develop into " actinomycosis ". For, it appears that Minett [1937], although admitting that " in its commonest form the disease is chronic ", developing slowly into diffuse induration of the gland, has, in none of the six cases studied, encountered the actino-body. Colebrook [1930] mentions a case of Staphylococcal " actinomycosis " in the elbow of a French soldier, which is perhaps the only case of its kind known in man. From bovines Magnusson has obtained still another bacillus276 "Actinomycosis" and Actinobacillosis in Animals diaphragm. The primary lesions as well as the metastatic ones were histologi- cally identical with typical " actinomycosis ". Magnusson mentions that Hulphers had obtained the same bacillus from nineteen out of sixty-seven jaw- lesions and Gunst [1927] from four out of seventeen cases. Experiments to produce the disease by inoculation of the pus-granules into healthy bovines were negative. The bacillus may, however, be looked upon as one capable of producing a chronic granuloma containing actino-bodies. From what has been mentioned above it will be apparent that in diag- nosing " actinomycosis " in animals the etiological agent should be the decid- ing factor if an expressive nomenclature is to be adopted. It has often been realised that the use of the comprehensive non-specific term " actinomycosis " leads to confusion. Thus loose statements are sometimes made that in actino- mycosis of the tongue and jaw, the lymph glands are affected ; the condition actually implied is actinobacillosis. Like Lignieres and Spitz [1902], Colebrook [1930] suggested the term actinophytosis to embody all disease conditions wherein granules with actino- bodies are formed, irrespective of etiology. Thus he suggested terms such as actinophytosis due to A. bovis (actinomycosis), due to A. lignieres (actino- bacillosis), due to Staphylococcus pyogenes, or due to Corynebacterium pyogenes. He also made a difference between actinomycosis due to A. bovis, and paracti- nomycosis (also an actinophytosis) due to filamentous micro-parasites other than A. bovis. He reserved the term streptothricosis for infections due to " filamentous organisms but showing no granules, or with granules with no clubs ". Bosworth [1930] suggested the terms ' actinomycosis ' due to A. bovis, ' actinobacillosis ' due to A. lignieresi and ' botryomycosis ' due to Staphylococcus pyogenes. There should be no objection to the adoption of the former two terms but the expression ' botryomycosis ' would lead to con- fusion. As it is, the term is inappropriate even in the case of the well-known equine malady. Considering the facts that the term has become well establish- ed for the equine disease, that it is suggestive of a mycotic infection, and that the disease may also occur in the equine udder [Hutyra and Marek, 1926] the term should not be adopted for designating " actinomycotic " mastitis in bovines. Davies [1935] has suggested the term ' actinococcosis ' which is expressive and at the same time homologous with the other two terms, actino- mycosis and actinobacillosis. But unlike Colebrook, Davies has not taken into consideration the evidence adduced by Magnusson [1928] in favour of C. pyogenes being a potential actinobody-producer in chronic infections. Should the contention of Magnusson be substantiated in future we will be re- quired to add another ' actino............'to Davies ' list. It is a pity that Colebrook's suggestions have not met with general appro- val in spite of the fact that his nomenclature is open to further addition of actinophytoses as new etiological agents are discovered, and that the term ' actinophytosis ' is a non-specific and yet an expressive one, and should only be used to designate conditions other than actinomycosis and actinobacillosis which terms should be specifically employed,
M. Y. MANGRULKAR 277 In the collection of this Institute are specimens which have been received from different parts of the country for microscopical examination and diag- nosis. Although the material is only meagre it is sufficient to prove the exist- ence of at least some of the actinophytoses in India. To add to the evidence, and for comparative study, some material was especially obtained by Mr. T. J. Hurley, M.R.C.V.S., D.V.S.M., I.V.S., (Offg. Veterinary Research Officer incharge of Pathology, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar) from the collections of the Veterinary College, Madras. To Mr. Hurley and to the authorities of the Madras College, I am greatly indebted for the help. The following record of the result of examination of the various specimens is not intended to give a histological study of the materials, for this has already been done by many other workers [Bosworth, 1923 ; M'Fadyean, 1932]. It is intended to show how with the help of available staining methods the etio- logy of the actino-body can be ascertained with great success. A. SPECIMEN 1357/1928 The material was received in May, 1928, in the form of two small pieces of tissue removed from the tongue of a six-year old country-bred, emaciated cow showing " swelling of the tongue with granulation tissue, difficulty in taking food ; foaming saliva coming out from the mouth". The condition was suspected to be " actinomycosis ". The tissue on histological examination proved negative at first, but on examination of sections prepared later " beautiful actinomyces clubs " were demonstrated but the responsible organism was not determined. As the material was exhausted, the author had to be satisfied with re-examination of available stained sections. Fragments of an actino-body, surrounded by a zone of cellular reaction, were seen in each section. The entire lesion was microscopic, non-elevated and situated superficially, embedded in the marked- ly hypertrophied epithelial layer of the tongue (Plate XIX fig. I). The focus had an extremely ill-formed outer capsule. On restaining some of the preparations, not Gram-positive but Gram- negative small bacilli were detected, the lesion resembling the one described later (Specimen 327A/1936, p. 283). This case appears to be the first in the records of this Institute, which from the clinical and histological features can be interpreted as one of actino- bacillosis. B. SPECIMEN 1557/1929 The information available in connection with this specimen is rather limi- ted. The tissue was removed from the shoulder of an ox and carcinoma was suspected. A diagnosis of " actinomycosis " was given in 1929. In freshly cut sec- tions (1937), the tissue showed itself to be the product of connective-tissue reaction in the subcutis. In it were found microscopic pus-foci which faded out peripherally into the surrounding granulomatous tissue. The centre of C
278 " Actinomycosis" and Actinobacillosis in Animals several foci revealed actino-bodies with clubs which were larger and more prominent than in actinomycosis (Plate XIX, fig. 2). In suitable sections, it was discovered that the minute central portion of the ray-colonies was occupied by a cluster of Gram-positive bacilli. Their exact identity could not be deter- mined but such characters, as are usually associated with diphtheroids, were observed, e.g., uneven staining, filamentous and coccoid forms, and club-like swellings. Fortunately a preparation of Corynebacterium pyogenes in tissue was available for comparison which afforded strong suggestive evidence in favour of the view that the bacteria in the actino-bodies were diphtheroids. In and around the pus-foci eosinophiles were very frequently seen but a careful search for worms or worm-ova, in sections and in caustic potash prepa- rations, proved entirely negative. No foreign body giant-cells were seen. Of the skin, only the deeper layers of the epidermis were visible in certain sections but no carcinoma was detected. The case was evidently one of actinophytosis due to a pleomorphic Gram- positive bacillus (? Corynebacterium) but not due to a Streptothrix. C. SPECIMEN 1857/1931 The material, which unfortunately could not be traced, was received from the Principal, Madras Veterinary College. It belonged evidently to the buffalo, referred to in the Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Madras, 1927-1928. It may be recalled that a Gram-positive Streptothrix was observed in sections. Although all necessary information is not avail- able with regard to this material, it is possible that the case was one of actino- mycosis. D. SPECIMEN 1862/1931 This specimen forms the subject of the paper presented by Datta [1933] to the Indian Science Congress in 1933. The material was received from the Superintendent, Sind and Rajputana, and consisted of " actinomycosis tu- mours removed from both parotid glands of a..............buffalo heifer ". The tumours were situated " about three inches below the base of the ears " and " measured three inches in diameter ". They were first noted as walnut- sized growths when the animal was about a year old and had grown to the size mentioned in six months at the end of which period they had begun to " emit a discharge " (fistula-formation) of the nature of stringy " thick inspissated pus ". There was difficulty in deglutition and breathing. After removal of the tumours, iodine treatment was adopted and " the heifer showed marked improvement ". On first examination of the tumour in October, 1931, " actinomycosis " was confirmed except that no Gram-positive filaments were seen. Subse- quent examination of sections made in August, 1932, and stained by Gram- Weigert revealed mycelial filaments inter-twined inside the " ray-fungus ".

M. Y. MANGRULKAR 279 A re-examination of the material was undertaken this year (1937) and numerous sections cut and stained by different methods. Histologically, the tissue represented an advanced chronic lymphadenitis with formation of abundant connective tissue wherein several small actino-bodies, usually in groups, were seen (Plate XIX, fig. 3). These were surrounded by a varying amount of cell-detritus. By Gram-Weigert method of staining, no evidence of a Gram-positive organism was detected. By modified Ziehl-Neelsen method (using two per cent sulphuric acid instead of twenty-five per cent), however, a beautiful and instructive picture was obtained (Plate XIX, fig. 4). The peri- pheral clubs were well formed and numerous. No filaments of streptothrix were observed in the colonies. Instead, centrally to the zone of clubs, and rarely in the peripheral zone itself, numerous masses of (Gram-negative) short bacilli were seen which could be clearly made out in the smaller (? early) single colonies. The results of the last examination agree with those of 1931 but cannot be reconciled with the observations recorded in 1932. The possibility of an actinomycetic infection is so remote as to be ruled out in view of the fact that actinomycosis does not spread by the lymphatics. I may here quote from Cope [1930] :280 "Actinomycosis" and Actinobacillosis in Animals On histological examination there could be no doubt about the actino- mycotic nature of the lesions. In the cheek, the " nodule " consisted of an abscess, about 0.75 cm. in diameter, in the thickness of the cheek away from the outer surface. The focus consisted mainly of polymorphs and contained numerous actino-bodies in different stages of formation. The Gram-positve branching streptothrix could be easily demonstrated in the lesion (Plate XX, fig. 2). It showed occasional terminal swellings, and slightly uneven Gram- positive character. In the skin the dermis showed signs of connective tissue proliferation (Plate XX, fig. 3) and contained a few pus-foci with actino-bodies due to the Gram-positive streptothrix. F. SPECIMEN 245, B/1934 The material was from a twelve-months old, cocoanut-sized, inoperable tumour of the lower lip of a bullock from Sind. Actinomycosis was suspected and confirmed by the evidence of " a few actino-granules " and " numerous mycelial masses ". It was unfortunate that old sections of this material were not available and that the material had become exhausted except for pieces of what appeared to be the reacting well-formed connective tissue. Repeated attempts to verify the diagnosis by making fresh sections proved of little value as nothing but the old granulomatous tissue was encountered in sections. Yet, by the situation of the lesion [ Cf. Specimens 175/1934 (p. 279) and 194/1937 (p. 284)] and by the diagnosis already given in 1934, there seems little doubt that the case was one of actinomycosis. In connection with the formation of abundant connective tissue in this case, the quotation from Cope [1930] may be continued : "..........Thirdly, everyone who has seen much of actinomycosis must have pondered over the remarkable reaction which the fungus causes in the connective tissues. I think it was Unna who pointed out that here we have an almost unique example of tissue reaction at a distance, for the changes may take place at a considerable distance from the place where the fungus is situated, and it is possible to cut many sections of the curiously hard gristly fibrous tissue, without find- ing any filaments of the parasite. This connective tissue reaction differs considerably from that found in tuberculosis and syphilis not only in the relative proportion of the various kinds of cells found in it, but also in the fact that the blood vessels are not obliterated. Exact- ly how the fungus causes the reaction is unknown ". G. SPECIMEN 192/1936 This specimen consisted of a piece of tumour from the nostril of a buffalo from the Civil Veterinary Department, Agra, U. P., presumably suspected for Schistosomic nasal granuloma. No other information was available in this case. A preliminary diagnosis of " actinomycosis " was given, but as no Gram- positive micro-organism was seen in sections a detailed study of the specimen was continued. At the end, the growth was diagnosed as actinobacillosis.

M. Y. MANGRULKAR 281 The tumour consisted of a highly cellular granulomatous tissue under the ciliated nasal mucous membrane with numerous foci of cellular reaction, containing polymorphs and showing occasional giant-cell formations. In these foci were seen, as a rule, groups of small, often apparently confluent actino-bodies (Plate XXI, fig. 1) with well-formed clubs. Again, no Gram- positive mycelium was seen, but by modified Ziehl-Neelsen method of staining masses of (Gram-negative) bacilli (Plate XXI, fig. 2) were detected amongst or just under the clubs except in the smallest (? early) colonies, where they were situated in the centre of the actino-body. The centre of the large (? older) colonies was left as an unstained more or less homogeneous mass. This specimen with which Specimen 1862/1931 (p. 278) affords a very re- markable comparison, offers good material for the study of typical actinobaci- llosis. Enquiries made for obtaining more information and material, especially for cultural examination, were unfortunately disappointing, the animal having died during the interim. H. SPECIMEN 296/1936 This material, the only one of its kind in the collection of the Institute, was received from Mr. Mutappa, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Ponampet, Mercara, to whom I am indebted for also furnishing a complete history of the case. The patient was a cross-bred spaniel of about two years which after a course of treatment for suspected distemper came under the observations of Mr. Mutappa on the 6th October 1936. High fever, dyspnoea, and an anxious look were noticed. The animal usually stood with the elbows turned out. The pulse was weak and irregular. Daily injections of Omnadin did little good and on the third day the animal was much worse, with laborious breath- ing and an almost inaudible heart-action. The patient died on the 9th October 1936. On autospy the " thoracic cavity was found to be filled with serosanguineous fluid. The pericardial sac was also highly enlarged with the sero-sanguineous fluid. Round about the pericardium, there were fibrinous growths. The lungs were normal. No parasites either in the lungs or the intestines were detected by me". The material submitted for examination was heart muscle and pericar- dium in formalin. With the naked eye, nothing beyond a fine villous proliferation on the outer surface of the heart (epicardium) and on the inner surface of the pericar- dial sac could be seen. On histological examination the suspicion of a neo- plastic disease was at once proven to be mistaken. The fine velvety appear- ance of the tissue was revealed to be a highly vascular granulomatous reaction (Plate XXI, fig. 3, and Plate XXII, fig. 1). In the epicardial lesion no actino-bodies were seen but fragments of a Gram-positive micro-organism in the form of fine branching filaments and coccoid forms, some contained within wandering cells, were observed,
282 "Actinomycosis" and Actinobacillosis in Animals The pericardium was unevenly but markedly thickened, and showed the disease in a more severe form, the entire organ being involved and more or less thickly covered with papilliform growths. The connective tissue reaction was severe and in the form of a highly vascular granulomatous tissue, as before, wherein foci of wandering cells, by no means rich in polymorphs, were seen. In these foci thickly felted masses of a Gram-positive Strepto- thrix (Plate XXII, figs. 2 and 3) could easily be detected. There was, however, no definite club-formation, although a slight swelling of the peripheral ends of some of the filaments was suggested. The filaments showed an uneven Gram- positive character and the cell-collection around the ray-colony was at places very scanty. A most remarkable feature of the pericardiac lesion was the presence, in the granulomatous tissue, of eggs (Plate XXII, fig. 4 and Plate XXIII, fig. 1) which in caustic potash preparations were observed to be operculated. No worms, or evidence of eosinophilia was noticed. The eggs were, in all pro- bability, of a trematode, and in view of the thoracic situation of the lesions and of the reported existence of the lung-fluke Paragonimus westermani from dogs in South India, the ova, by their size, may well have been of this species, although no worms were detected by Mr. Mutappa at autopsy. How these eggs came to be situated in the lesions and what part, if any, they played in the causation of the " actinomycotic " disease are questions which cannot be readily answered. Although Streptothrix infection in canines is definitely rare, various authors have, from time to time, observed its occurrence in other parts of the world, and some of them have expressed the identity of the causative organism with A. bovis. Vachetta [1882] was the first to detect " actinomycosis " of the jaw of a dog. Rivolta [1884] described a purulent pleurisy in a dog due to an unbranched leptothrix type of organism. Rabe [1888] described three cases of " actinomycosis " of the dog ; in two there was suppurative phleg- mon, and in the third a blood-tinged purulent peritonitis was observed. A filamentous organism, C ladothrix canis (Rabe), was seen in the actino-bodies. Rabe [1888] succeeded in transmitting the disease to a dog by inoculation of pus from the third case, and recovered the organism. Hartl [1901] met with one case of " actinomycotic " tumour in the mediastinum and thoracic wall. Bahr [1904] described " actinomycosis " of the dog and cultivated the causative streptothrix. Schnelle [1929] described the case of a dog, similar to that of Mr. Mutappa, but wherein abscesses appeared on the skin which showed on autopsy an effusive pleurisy with reddish cloudy exudate, granulations on the pleurae, broncho-pneumonia with consolidation, and greyish nodules in the lungs throughout. Microscopically, Streptothrix canis was detected. Feldman and Mann [1932] described an extensive granulomatous condition of the sub- mucosa of the dog's stomach with typical actino-bodies with clubs but without a demonstrable central Gram-positive filamentous mass either in sections, or in culture, or by animal inoculation. Histologically, their case resembled to some extent the one encountered by the author in a bovine [Spec. 1557/1929 (p. 277.)]. Sheather [1932] reported a finely divided papilloma-like growth removed from the thoracic cavity of a dog, which histologically revealed the

M. Y. MANGRULKAR 283 picture of typical granules without clubs. Baudet [1934] studied three cases of cutaneous " actinomycosis " of the dog wherein the blood-stained granular pus showed Gram-positive branched and unbranched filaments with terminal swellings but no clubs. In culture the organism corresponded with Cohni- streptothrix [Pinoy, 1911, Syn. Streptothrix, Cohn, 1875] israeli [Syn. Actino- myces bovis, Harz 1877]. Baudet named it Cohnistreptothrix canis. Fethers [1934] described a case of " actinomycosis " of the skin of the dog, which led to purulent peritonitis with involvement of the abdominal wall and liver. Microscopically a Gram-positive Streptothrix with rare clubs was seen. In India, too, the condition in the dog is very rare, the meagre information about its occurrence being only in the Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Madras (1934-1935). It will be seen that the evidence is in support of the occurrence of Strepto- thrix infection in the dog. By comparison with similar cases of other authors, Rivolta's case would appear to be one of actinomycetic infection. Although in some cases the available information does not render classification on Colebrook's lines possible, the great majority of them do not show definite club-formation and evidently belong to the group of Streptothricoses. Until more work is done regarding the causative organism (s) of Streptothrix infec- tions in canines, the organisms named C. canis (Rabe) and C. canis (Baudet) may be conveniently brought under the more generally adopted generic name, Actinomyces. The existence of A. canis is in fact recognized in modern veterinary text- books which describe it as a specific, chromogenic organism of which both aerobic and anaerobic strains exist. The parasite is pathogenic to mice, rabbits and dogs284 "Actinomycosis" and Actinobacillosis in Animals J. SPECIMEN 194/1937 This was received by special request, from the Veterinary College, Mad- ras. It consisted ofM. Y. MANGRULKAR 285 From swine a large number of cases of " actinomycosis " have been des- cribed since the first case of Johne in 1879. The most common lesions are those found in the udder, particularly in old sows [Magnusson, 1928]. Although other sites of infection have been described, e.g., pharyngeal region, cervical or dorsal vertebrae, lungs, and substance of the skeletal muscle [M'Fadyean, 1889], it seems probable that not all take the form of actinophytosis. The lung lesions described by Albiston [1921] were, however, of true actinomycosis. Magnusson failed, in his extensive work, to encounter in pigs anything comparable with the bovine actinobacillosis of the organs of the head, the lesions being exclusively in the udder, caused by two types of A. bovis and by Staphylococcus pyogenes. He has singularly failed to meet with a case of actinobacillosis, although according to Griffith [1931], the bacillus is known to infect porcine udders. Experimental inoculations in pigs, using the Strepto- thrix and the Staphylococcus from actual lesions, have been successful [Mag- nusson, 1928]. In calcareous deposits in pig's muscles, an Actinomyces286 "Actinomycosis" and Actinobacillosis in Animals 1930 and, in view of the above statement of Magnusson, perhaps in rare cases in animals. In this connection the report, by Awrorow [1932], of bovine renal actinomycosis may be of interest. With material from actual cases of infection by A. bovis, the disease has been successfully transmitted to cattle [Magnusson, 1928], but not to dog, sheep, goat and horse. Similar success has attended experiments wherein Actinobacillus from natural cases was inoculated subcutaneously into cattle, but only rarely does a strain of the bacillus prove intraperitoneally pathogenic to guinea-pigs. Hulphers [1923] has produced staphylococcal " actinomycotic " mastitis in a cow experimentally, using cultures from a natural case ; but, Magnusson was not successful in similar experiments of his own. Research workers [Lignieres and Spitz, 1902 ; Bosworth, 1930 ; Mag- nusson, 1928 ; Griffith, 1931] claim that diagnosis of actinobacillosis can be made by use of the agglutination test. Recently, however, Thompson [1933] has pointed out difficulties in utilizing the test for cattle as considerable anti- genic variation exists between strains of Actinobacillus. In New Zealand [1934], the test is reported to be giving useful results. Attempts to diagnose actinomycosis in the living patient by serological methods have not been successful. Colebrook [1920] states that in man the serum of a heavily infected case will agglutinate A. bovis. This test has been useful in ascertaining the presence of more than one serological type of the organism but does not appear to have been generally adopted in clinical prac- tice. Attempts to develop an intradermal allergic test in man have given inconstant results. The reactions obtained by Adant and Spehl [1935] are alleged to have been indicative of a mycotic, not necessarily actinomycotic infection. Mathieson, Harrison, Hammond and Henrici [1935] have found that normal persons often showed a more marked reaction to the test than did actinomycosis-patients [Mark and Auerbach, 1937]. The finding of Corynebacterial actinophytosis by Magnusson [1928], Hulphers [1923] and Gunst [1927] in jaw-lesions and in post-traumatic poly- poid growths in the rumen and reticulum of bovines has not been universally recognised, perhaps on grounds of insufficient data. It appears that this disease-condition should be investigated further with the object of eliminating the possibility of a mixed infection in every case encountered. Cultural and biological tests by Magnusson [1928], however, tend to exclude this possi- bility. Gillain [1932] has recently recorded a case of actinomycosis of the superior maxilla of a bovine due to A. breviora, but the study of the organism is incom- plete. Actinophytosis is also known to occur in sheep. It affects the jaw, lips, tongue, and lungs. The common causative organism appears to be Actino- bacillus. Actinomyces caprae, an aerobic species, has been recorded from pseudotu- berculous lesions in goat's lungs in 1899 [R. St. John-Brooks, 1931].
M. Y. MANGRULKAR 287 Edington [1934] has isolated A. bovis from a subcutaneous sinus of a cat. The sinus was discharging pus containing granules showing the Streptothrix. Cases of Streptothrix infection, not amounting to actinophytosis, are also known to occur in the fowl. Actinomyces tossicus (aerobic) has been isolated from tumours in the abdominal cavity. The only case reported from a fowl in India is that of streptothricosis of the cloacal region (Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Madras, 1933-34). Amongst wild animals, too, infection by Streptothrix is by no means un- common. " Moody has described lesions, clearly actinomycotic in the bones of a fossil rhinoceros. The disease is known to occur in deer and moose, sometimes in epidemic form " [Henrici, 1930]. Fox [1923] mentioned the occurrence of actinomycosis in American Tapirs and has isolated an aerobic species, Actinomyces (Nocardia*) macrodipodidarum, from lesions resembling " lumpy jaw " in Kangaroos. The Kangaroo disease has been described as a streptothricosis causing swellings and ulcerations about the lips, tongue and teeth. It has already been stated elsewhere that the aerobic Streptothrix of Bostroem is now generally regarded as a mere saprophyte of no etiological significance and that actinomycosis in man and animals is caused by the Israel type of organism viz., A. bovis. There is, however, no definite information as to the pathogenesis of the disease. The findings of Lord [1910] that A. bovis is normally found in the mouth cavity (and alimentary tract, Naeslund, 1931) of normal individuals and particularly around carious teeth, and that local injuries assist in setting up the disease, have found general support [Cope, 1930 ; Davies, 1932 ; Naeslund, 1931 ; Mark and Auerbach, 1937]. It is thought that in some cases of actinomycosis of the lungs the organism may- have been conveyed from the mouth by aspiration. The idea that A. bovis lives in the soil and on cereal plants and infects through contaminated food (straw and grain) has now been practically abandoned. Once the organism has established the infection in the tissues, further pro- gress of the disease is only a question of time. Pus-formation by accumulation of cell detritus around the actino-body occurs as a result of tissue reaction in which neutrophils, lymphocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells take part. The microscopic sulphur granules are thus formed. (It appears to the author that granules need not be macroscopic in all actinophytoses). As the ray- colony grows (? terminal) portions of the mycelium are said to resolve them- selves into minute coccoid bodies, comparable, according to some [M'Fadyean, 1889 ; Bosworth, 1923], to conidia, which are liberated, as it were, to be en- gulfed, as also are detached fragments of the mycelium itself, by phagocytes. These cells may either digest the infective agent or may help to convey it to *The generic term Nocardia is used by Wright [1905] and his followers to indicate the aerobic saprophytic actinomycetes, some of which may be pathogenic.
288 "Actinomycosis" and Actinobacillosis in Animals other neighbouring areas and thus start a fresh focus of infection. Not rarely these coccoid bodies and even mycelial filaments may be disseminated without the intermediation of phagocytes [M'Fadyean, 1889 ; Delepine, 1890]. The significance of the association, in human actinomycosis, of Bacillus actinomycetem comitans is not known. The bacillus was first described by Klinger in 1912 and has subsequently been encountered by others. It is a small, Gram-negative, pleomorphic, non-motile, non-sporulating, non-encap- sulated organism and a facultative anaerobe, fatal intravenously to rabbits and intraperitoneally to guinea-pigs. The formation of clubs at the periphery of the actino-body is still a matter of dispute. It is apparent from literature on the subject that clubs are in many cases, a result of tissue reaction [Meyer and Mayer, 1927]. In actino- mycosis, however, they are said to represent parts derived from the causal organism. They are interpreted as degenerated mycelial ends [M'Fadyean, 1889] ; or are explained, by many workers, to be formed by the thickening of the mycelial capsule [Delepine, 1890 ; Bostroem, 1890]. Others regard them as organs of fructification giving rise by budding to spores which help to spread the infection to fresh foci [Crookshank, 1888 ; Gibson, 1934]. Brumpt [1906] interprets them as the youngest members of the infective agent supplying nourishment to the older and more centrally situated members, the mycelia. A brief note on the systematic position of Actinomycetes may be made here. For want of an accurate knowledge of morpholgy, the claim on this group is divided between bacteriologists and mycologists. The former base their arguments mainly on the unusually slender mycelium (0.2 to 1.0 µ) and on the production of bacilliform asexual reproductive elements (arthrospores) of the same thickness as the mycelium, and include the organisms under the Schizo- mycetes ; whereas, the latter emphasize the formation of spores similar to that of conidia in the Fungi Imperfecti (Hyphomycetes), and on the markedly low heat resistance of these spores. Still others regard them as intermediate forms between bacteria and fungi, or as a parent group from which sprang the fungi and certain bacteria viz., Mycobacteria and Corynebacteria. Some authors [Magnusson, 1928 ; Haupt and Zeki, 1933 ; and Klimmer, 1934] have sugges- ted affinities of A. bovis with the Corynebacteria ; a few others [Grootten, 1934] have put forward a plea in favour of the Mycobacterial nature of Actino- myces, and as in the case of Mycobacterium tuberculosis evidence of a filtrable form of A. bovis has been recently put forth by Sartory, Sartory and Meyer [1933]. The position of Actinobacillus amongst the bacteria is not disputed but although it is generally considered to belong to the family Actinomycetaceae, Beaver and Thompson [1930] have suggested its place alongside Pfeifferella. It will be realised from this paper that the position with regard to " actino- mycotic " diseases is very unsatisfactory, not only in India but also in other countries whence, in spite of intensive researches, conflicting statements are not infrequently reported regarding various aspects of the subject. The pro- blem is intensified considerably for the veterinarian by the fact that not one

MANGRULKAR 289 but a number of etiological agents are responsible for producing such closely similar lesions that definite etiological diagnosis can be arrived at only after cultural and microscopical examination of the material. The following state- ment of Henrici [1930], made in connection with actinomycosis only, will suffice to illustrate this point:290 "Actinomycosis" and Actinobacillosis in Animals Bosworth, T. J.

GIBSONI INFECTION, WITH OBSERVA- TIONS ON THEIR PATHOLOGY AND HAEMOCYTOLOGY BY J. F. SHIRLAW, M.R.C.V.S., Pathologist, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar-Kumaun (Received for publication on 22nd June, 1937) (With Plates XXV294 'Lahore Canine Fever' and 'Tick Fever' of dogs degree of resistance exhibited by pariah crosses is noted. The resistance to infection and the likelihood of recovery can be computed, within reasonable limits, on the basis of the percentage of pariah blood in the cross. There are strong grounds for suspicion, therefore, that pariahs are the natural sources of infection. A definite seasonal incidence exists in ' Lahore Canine Fever.' The smaller incidence occurs during the beginning of the hot season, i.e., from the middle of March to the end of May and the greater towards the end of the hot weather, i.e., from the middle of September to the first or second week in November. Very few cases have been encountered in the real hot season. This interesting observation immediately afforded a clue in the investiga- tion. The periods noted synchronise with the two tick seasons, and it very quickly became obvious that ticks were of important significance in the spread of the disease. The first question that naturally presented itself seemed legiti- mateJ. F. SHIRLAW 295 P. gibsoni, a successful infection296 ' Lahore Canine Fever' and 'Tick Fever' of dogs This sums up the efforts made to prove a bacterial etiology in this parti- cular form of canine fever. The evidence is unconvincing. The writer has on several occasions isolated Salmonella-like organisms from the faeces of dogs affected with ' Lahore Canine Fever'. He has equally frequently isolated similar types of organism from healthy dogs and has refused to consider their potential pathogenicity, in that the serum of affected dogs failed to betray the slightest trace of agglutination and their inoculation by various routes yielded consistently negative results. Finally, the study of the temperature charts of the affected dogs and their clinical syndrome in comparison with the known syndrome and pyrexial phase of Salmonella infections in the human subject, enhanced the uncertainty of accepting a bacterial etiology for this affection of dogs. The writer is further convinced of the insupportability of the claims to establish a bacterial etiology as he had an opportunity of subjecting certain of the fever cases, from which the Salmonella-like strains were isolated, to post mortem examination. The findings were identical, both on the pathological and histological grounds, with those present in ' Lahore Canine Fever.' SYMPTOMATOLOGY The disease is of sudden onset. Without any warning, a dog which had appeared perfectly normal a few hours previously, is found dull and dejected. The temperature is discovered to be higher than the physical condition would seem to indicate and is within the range of 104°J. F. SHIRLAW 297 The diagnosis of the case at this stage is frequently given, although wrongly, as acute gastro-enteritis and a superficial evaluation of the symptoms would seem to support this view. The temporary alleviation of fever is suc- ceeded by an abrupt rise, possibly up to 106°F. and the temperature fluctuates between 103298 'Lahore Canine Fever' and 'Tick Fever' of dogs (ii) Haemoglobin percentage estimation (Tallquist scale); (iii) Variations in blood cytology. The following data emerged from these simple routine observations : (a) At the onset of fever, there is a marked leucocytosis, many of the leucocytes being of an immature type resembling the promyelocyte ; (b) Platelets are obviously more numerous; (c) Erythrocytes are normal in size, although a peculiar vacuolation is frequent (corps demi-lune). (d) The haemoglobin percentage is normal; (e) As the disease progresses, vacuolation of the erythrocytes increases and large mononucleated cells make their appearance. These are typical histiocytes and two forms, one large and possessed of a kidney shaped nucleus and one smaller, with a rounded nucleus, are observed. The cytoplasm of these cells is hyaline and agranular. Gradually these cells increase in number until they are very evident. (f) After the lapse of about two weeks, the haemoglobin percentage falls to about sixty, and from this period to the last week or two of the illness, it fluctuates around this figure. (g) It is apparent that there is no destruction of erythrocytes or haemo- globinaemia in the circulating blood. (h) The types and numbers of leucocytes present show a definite indi- cation of a ' shift to the left'. (i) The changes are progressive and towards the termination of the disease there is a sudden and marked fall in the haemoglobin percentage (20J. F. SHIRLAW 299 In the majority of cases, P. gibsoni has never been detected in the blood throughout the course of the illness, even in the terminal stages when profound anaemic changes are present. The post mortem picture is typical and easily summarised : changes mainly affect the spleen and liver. In acute cases of a short duration of illness, the spleen is markedly enlarged, increased up to ten times the normal weight, dark red in colour or even chocolate, the follicles enlarged and prominent. In one case, the spleen was grossly enlarged, filling the abdominal cavity, intensely haemorrhagic in appearance and several haemorrhagic infarcts were promi- nent. The spleen in these cases is softer in texture and somewhat diffluent. In more protracted cases it is firmer in texture, somewhat ' fibroid ' occasion- ally, with less prominent follicles. The liver is similarly grossly enlarged : in one case, 16.6 per cent of the body weight. (The percentage weight of the liver to the body weight in health is 3 per cent. Sisson.). The organ appears finely cirrhotic, darker or slaty in colour, the surface granular and studded with petechiae and frequently bile-stained. The blood is thin and watery. The systemic lymph glands are swollen and haemorrhagic. The heart muscle usually shows an acute interstitial myocarditis. The mucous membrane of the gastro-intestinal tract is covered with a sticky mucuous deposit. Petechiae are frequently prominent and occasionally discrete areas of ulceration. The duodenum in its first part is deeply stained with bile and occasionally the pylorus. In acute cases, the red bone marrow is hyperaemic and increased in amount at the expense of the fatty marrow. In more chronic cases, this change is not so evident. Histopathological changes have been centred on the spleen, liver and bone marrow. SPLEEN The follicular lymphoidal cells are increased in number and mitosis is evident, especially in peripheral cells where these seem to be undergoing a transformation into larger cells (polyblast, transitional plasma cells, and macrophages) with a clear cytoplasm and irregular nucleus300 'Lahore Canine Fever' and 'Tick Fever' of dogs changes are noted. While mitosis and marked proliferation of the cells is present, karryorhexis is evident in similar cells, the cytoplasm of which stains faintly and appears as a mere rim around the disintegrating nucleus. The majority of the cells present have clear, round nuclei, in which the chromatin particles radiate from a central mass of nuclear chromatin. These cells present themselves as typical reticular cells and similar cells are found lining the spleen sinusoids. The second type of cell of numerical importance is smaller than the foregoing. The nucleus is compact, deeply basophilic with no internal structure. These are transitional lymphocytes and haemocytoblasts (polyblasts). Interspersed with these are nucleated red blood cells in consi- derable numbers. The venous sinuses are distended and the lining (littoral) cells of the reticulo-endothelium show distinct mitosis. Many of the hyper- plastic (macrophage) cells of the pulp contain blood pigment. A more import- ant observation is that peculiar granules, staining intensely with Heidenhain's iron haematoxylin, are found inside the cytoplasm of the polyblasts and reti- cular cells. These granules are regular in size and appear in small well-defined clusters. The nucleus of the cells in which they appear is distinct and free from any degeneration. Similar forms, in larger clumps, may be found in extracellular situations, as well as within the cytoplasm of the cells mentioned. These forms stain indeterminately by the Romanowsky stains and judging by a comparison of Heidenhain's stain on sections of the same tissue, it appears that only a few of the bodies can be stained by this method. Pappenheim's stain gives negative results. The changes of importance in the spleen may, therefore, be summed up under three heads, intense and extensive cellular hyperplasia, with the development of polyblasts and macrophages, haemato- poiesis, and the appearance of peculiar, structureless inclusion bodies of small size, both within and without the proliferating cells. LIVER The changes in the liver are associated with an intense congestion. The predominant feature is a reaction of the reticulo-endothelial cells lining the sinusoids and the presence of blood pigment in these cells (cells of Kupffer) which appear larger than normal. Necrosis and fatty degeneration is patchy throughout the lobules and the appearance of an intense cellular infiltration throughout, in some cases, suggests profound toxic excitation of the sub- stance of the organ. THE BONE MARROW The bone marrow shows changes similar to those described in the red pulp of the spleen, with an erythropoiesis of an exaggerated degree. ' Inclu- sion bodies ' are much more prominent than in the spleen and they are also found in the haemocytoblasts.
J. F. SHIRLAW 301 EXPERIMENTAL A preliminary study of ' Lahore Canine Fever' revealed the essential lesions in the reticulo-endothelial system, notably spleen and bone marrow, with an active erythropoiesis in these tissues. It has been mentioned that, in a small minority of cases, P. gibsoni suddenly made its appearance in the peri- pheral blood, and in a transient fashion, frequently towards the termination of the disease. As such cases were maintained in tick-free dog kennels, it was unjustifiable to assume an intercurrent infection as an explanation of the pheno- menon. Moreover, as the symptomatology and haemocytology of these cases which had, perforce, to be acknowledged true gibsoni infections ran a course parallel to true 'Lahore Canine Fever' in which no parasites could be deter- mined, and as the essential pathology was similar, a suspicion led to the possibi- lity that' Lahore Canine Fever ' is, in actuality ' tick fever ' due to P. gibsoni. It became necessary, therefore, to study the syndrome and pathology of dogs artificially infected with P. gibsoni. The chief difficulty lay in obtaining suitable experimental animals. The reaction of the adult pariah dogs obtained from Lahore city, when inoculated with P. gibsoni, is erratic. In a few cases, the inoculation of blood containing P. gibsoni resulted in a P. canis infection. The source of the P. gibsoni blood used in the transmission experiments was a European owned dog which never, at any time, during observations over seven months, showed any P. canis in its blood. As P. canis is always easily demonstrable when present, the assump- tion is valid that this parasite was not introduced accidentally into the experi- mental dogs along with the P. gibsoni. The only explanation that seems to offer a solution is that the experimental dogs were naturally, if latently, infect- ed with P. canis and that the introduction of P. gibsoni flared up the infection. A considerable number of dogs entirely failed to react to the infection. It must- be mentioned that experimental dogs were observed for two weeks prior to inoculation and were maintained in positively tick-free kennels. It quickly became evident that, if any progress were to be made with the investigation in hand, experiments would require to be conducted on puppies that had been reared in tick-free kennels. It was considered necessary, in view of the racial immunity factor, to use dogs of a pure imported strain, but as this proved an obstacle, the pups used for experiment were from pariah bitches and cross-bred dogs, in one case, a pure bred dog. By this method, it was possible to secure several litters from which the best pups were selected and sixteen puppies were put to experiment. These were all artificially infected in course of time. The majority were used in experimental treatment but seven remained untreated for study of the natural disease. Puppies Nos. 3 and 4 were subcutaneously inoculated with 2.5 c.c. virulent blood and failed to react over a period of observation of two months. Puppy No. 13 was inoculated on 25th June 1935 with virulent blood and failed to react. One month later it was inoculated with 5 c.c. spleen emulsion in F
302 'Lahore Canine Fever' and 'Tick Fever' of dogs normal saline from puppy No. 6, an acute experimental case (Chart No. 1), which had been subjected to experimental treatment with S. U. P. 36. No reaction occurred to the second inoculation but on 11th August 1935, the picture of an early commencing secondary anaemia was obtained in blood film examination. The puppy was then destroyed by electrocu- tion. No parasites had been observed in its peripheral blood. The weight of this puppy was 22.5 lb. and at post mortem the spleen weighed six ounces (i.e., 1.66 per cent of the body weight). According to Sisson, the weight of the spleen in a normal sized dogJ. F. SHIRLAW 303 Puppy No. 16 was subcutaneously inoculated on 1st August 1935 with 5 c. c. of a normal saline suspension of spleen and bone marrow from Puppy No. 11, which showed numerous, if periodic, P. gibsoni in its blood during life. This case was observed for eighty-six days. On the thirteenth day, the normal incubation period of a P. gibsoni infection, there was a mild up- ward trend to a slightly higher temperature level and in the first half of the second month, the temperature fluctuated between 103304 'Lahore Canine Fever' and 'Tick Fever' of dogs forty-seventh day it was numerous, after which it disappeared until the eighty- ninth day. On the fiftieth day the haemoglobin percentage was 50. Treat- ment with S. U. P. 36 was commenced on the fifty-sixth day and thus removed the case from the field of comparative clinical consideration. Puppy No. 7 (Chart 2) was inoculated subcutaneously with 1 c.c. virulent blood on 28th March 1934 and treatment with tryparsamide was commenced on the 21st May 1934. A febrile reaction commenced early in this case, a typical ' swinging ' fever very similar to that seen in a clinical case of ' Lahore Canine Fever', if somewhat less marked. Pathological cells appeared in the blood (histiocytes and bi- and tri-lobed leucocytes) on the twenty-fifth day, when the haemoglobin percentage was 80. P. gibsoni was found scantily on the thirty-first day and remained till the thirty-fourth day. It did not reappear till the forty-fourth day and in the interval profound secondary anaemia was evident with a haemoglobin percentage of 40. Parasites remained present, in very small numbers from the forty-fourth day until the commencement of treatment. Although these experiments were complicated by the presence of a certain quantity of pariah blood (i.e., immune blood) in the experimental puppies, yet it will be seen from them that important facts can be deduced in relation to those known concerning 'Lahore Canine Fever' and these show the close analogy between the two diseases. Clinically, both are characterised by a ' swinging ' pyrexia. Periodically there is an abatement of fever, when the temperature may drop to within a normal range, succeeded, usually abruptly, by a sharp upward rise. In the experimental dogs, this upward trend coincided with the appearance of P. gibsoni in the circulating blood. (See charts). In Puppy No. 10, it will be seen, however, that the appearance of the piroplasm coincides with the remission of fever. In certain authentic cases of ' Lahore Canine Fever ' which had, owing to the sudden appearance of P. gibsoni, towards the terminal phase of the disease, to be accepted as originally true P. gibsoni infec- tions, a similar feature was noted. A most important observation arising from the clinical examination both of cases of ' Lahore Canine Fever ' and artifi- cially induced P. gibsoni infection is that, within three to four weeks there is evidence in the circulating blood of commencing derangement of the haemo- poietic system, especially the reticulo-endothelium of the spleen. This is evidenced by the appearance of histiocytes; and slightly later, by a type of leucocytosis in which the leucocytes are bi- or tri-lobed (shift to the left). The origin of this phase may be argued from the post mortem examinations. It probably depends on an invasion of the leucoblastic tissues on the part of the erythroblastic in the medullary centres, an invasion probably accompanied by some degree of toxic change. The clinical history of Puppy No. 13 enhances the analogy. This case resembled an authentic case of ' Lahore Canine Fever ' in every detail, even to the complete absence of P. gibsoni in the circulating blood during the disease syndrome. The case of Puppy No. 15 was only slightly different. The dis- ease syndrome was similar to ' Lahore Canine Fever ', but P. gibsoni made its
J. F. SHIRLAW 305 appearance in the last few days of illness. This case corresponds very closely with those cases just mentioned in which, after weeks of negative blood exami- nation, a case is accepted as authentic ' Lahore Canine Fever '306 'Lahore Canine Fever' and 'Tick Fever' of dogs A dog was, accordingly, inoculated with a pure strain of T. evansi and destroy- ed at the point of death, after showing a syndrome typical of the infection. The lesions of this disease affect chiefly the haematopoietic tissues, liver, spleen and bone marrow, and are consequent on a rapid destruction of erythrocytes in the circulating blood, with a profound secondary anaemia not clinically unlike that seen in a pure P. gibsoni infection. The spleen and liver were markedly enlarged and the bone marrow hyperaemic. Sections of these tissues, stained by Heidenhain failed to show any of the bodies described. Similarly, tissues of the hill bull which had succumbed to a Babesia infection were examined with negative results. It appears, therefore, that these bodies are specific for ' Lahore Canine Fever' and. artificially produced P. gibsoni infection, and as ring forms of P. gibsoni are so frequently absent, or at least not found, in such infections, one is led to question whether these bodies do not represent a phase in the development of the life-cycle of P. gibsoni. When the infrequency, or complete absence of parasites from the circulating blood is considered in rela- tion to the development of a type of anaemia indicating early involvement of the haemopoietic tissues, it appears a natural assumption that P. gibsoni is essentially a parasite of the reticulo-endothelium of the haematopoietic tissues. The appearance, of P. gibsoni in the circulating blood would, in these circums- tances, be regarded as fortuitous. This is an aspect of the problem, however, which further protozoological study alone can decide. Suffice to say that in Puppy No. 15 which was inoculated with emulsion prepared from spleen of Puppy No. 12 in which ring forms of P. gibsoni could not be found and these bodies were numerous, a typical infection resulted, in which P. gibsoni was found. DISCUSSION The literature on ' tick fever ' due to P. gibsoni is small, little work has been done on the pathology and practically none on the histopathology of the disease. In spite of this, it is difficult to explain the confusion which has existed in the correct interpretation of a disease possessing the syndrome of ' Lahore Canine Fever.' This is a disease showing striking evidence of haematopoietic involvement, similar to that encountered in an authentic case of ' tick fever ' and yet there has been, on the part of previous investigators, a reluctance to classify this disease as ' tick fever ' due to P. gibsoni. There appear several reasons for this. Sufficient attention has not been paid to the fact that, in true ' tick fever ' the presence of P. gibsoni in the cir- culating blood is extremely erratic. It may be found only once or twice during an extended attack of disease, or not at all. In Patton's [1910] original note on the subject, he drew attention to the periodicity of the infection present in the erythrocytes and Symons [1926-27] in the protocols of his excellent publica- tion, clearly indicated the infrequency of parasites in the natural disease. It appears to have been assumed that, because in the allied infection due to P: canis, in which the blood always contains parasites in increasing numbers throughout the course of the disease, the same observation must be true of a P. gibsoni infection.
J. F. SHIRLAW 307 These two infections, though clinically somewhat comparable, run an entirely different course in haemocytological observations, although patholo- gically comparable in the end result. In a P. canis infection there is an early invasion, anisocytosis and destruction of the erythrocytes. The serum is ting- ed, sometimes deeply, with haemoglobin liberated from the breaking down of erythrocytes and there is an increase of the corpuscular sedimentation rate. In a P. gibsoni infection, there may be an early and transient invasion of the erythrocytes. There is, however, no anisocytosis and destruction of the erythrocytes in the circulating blood, and no evidence of liberated haemoglobin in the serum. (These observations are enhanced by the fact that in a P. canis infection, haemoglobinuria is a characteristic symptom, whereas, in a P. gibsoni infection, this symptom is never noted.) At the same time, there is an increased fragility of the erythrocytes in a P. canis, which is absent in a P. gibsoni infection. It has already been noted that in an experimentally produced P. gibsoni infection, the histiocytes of spleen origin (reticulo-endothelial) early make their appearance. In a true P. canis infection, there is no such evidence of an early involvement of the reticulo-endothelial system. Anaemic changes occur during the latter phase of the infection and are obviously prompted by the stimulus provided by the erythrocyte destruction and loss. It is believed, from these observations, that P. gibsoni is essentially a parasite of the reticulo- endothelium, unlike P. canis which appears primarily as a parasite of the erythrocytes. On this basis, apart from the experimental pathological evidence which has been produced, it is possible to explain the infrequency of P. gibsoni in the circulating blood and even its total absence during the course of the disease. And it is then possible to understand the reluctance to accept ' Lahore Canine Fever' as a P. gibsoni infection. In addition to this consideration, previous workers have been impressed by the dysenteric symptoms, accompanied by rapid wasting, which, are not infrequent. It is, apparently, these symptoms which have prompted several workers to consider the disease ' Canine Enteric Fever'. Osmand Bodman and Cooper (unpublished work) noted intestinal ulceration as one of the prominent lesions in their investigations, and it was from such cases that they obtain the Salmonella strains mentioned earlier in this note. Symons [1926] and Clive Webb [1906] have drawn attention, however, to the frequency with which dysentery and intestinal ulceration complicate the syndrome of an authentic P. gibsoni infection. It is certain that a few dogs normally harbour Salmonella strains and it is possible that under the stress of debility induced by the primary protozoan infection, these orga- nisms, potentially latent, assume a pathogenic role. Against this possibility, however, must be mentioned the fact that such cases fail to give a positive Widal test against the Salmonella strains isolated.
308 'Lahore Canine Fever' and 'Tick Fever' of dogs Lastly, it is believed that much of the refusal to consider the possibility of ' Lahore Canine Fever ' as being in reality a P. gibsoni infection, has origi- nated in the widespread belief that Novarsenobillon and similar drugs have a specific curative effect in P. gibsoni infections. While a very few cases of ' Lahore Canine Fever' have been successfully treated with Tryparsamide and Novarsenobillon, the great majority of cases have failed to respond to treatment. The writer conducted a series of experiments on the treatment of experimentally produced P. gibsoni infection in dogs. The results will shortly be published, but at this juncture it may be stated that no drug was found that could be said to have any curative or specific effect in this infection. In view of the experimental evidence, supported by these observations, it is believed that' Lahore Canine Fever,' which finds its counterpart in' Canine Enteric Fever ' and ' Canine Typhus Fever' is, in actuality, ' Tick Fever ', associated with P. gibsoni infection. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 1. ' Lahore Canine Fever ' is one of the most important causes of death of dogs in Lahore and evidence is adduced to show that it is the same disease as has been investigated by workers in other parts of India and designated various- ly ' Canine Typhus Fever ' and ' Canine Enteric Fever '. 2. The disease occurs during the tick seasons, but has not been accepted as ' tick fever ', through general inability to demonstrate the causal parasite in the blood of infected dogs, combined with the general refractoriness to treat- ment with arsenical preparations. 3. The latter aspect of the disease will be dealt with in a later article. 4. An account is given of the clinical features and pathology of ' Lahore Canine Fever' with a comparison of experimentally produced disease of P. gibsoni origin. 5. The proof that ' Lahore Canine Fever ' is ' tick fever ' is based on the following observations:J. F.

STUDIES ON THE GASTEROSTOMATOUS PARASITES OF INDIAN FOOD-FISHES BY HAR DAYAL SRIVASTAVA, D.Sc. Helminthologist (On special duty), Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar-Kumaun (Received for publication on 25th March 1938) (With ten text-figures) THE earliest work on the Gasterostomatous trematodes is by Rudolph [1819], who described Monost. crucibulum and Monost. galeatum. The generic names Bucephalus and Gasterostomum were proposed by Baer [1827] and Siebold [1848] respectively. In 1883, Ziegler pointed out the identity of the two genera and on grounds of priority retained the genus Bucephalus. [Braun [1883] created the family Gasterostomidae but as Gasterostomum is synony- mous with Bucephalus, the family name Gasterostomidae lapses into synonymy of Bucephalidae Poche, 1907. The original genus was divided by Diesing [1858] into two genera, Bucephalus and Rhipidocotyle, a fact which has been overlooked by several subsequent workers. In 1905, Odhner created a new genus Prosorhynchus for species with a rhynchus and maintained the genus Gasterostomum for forms with an anterior sucker. Nine years later Nicoll [1914] studied the group in detail and divided the family Bucephalidae into two subfamilies, Prosorhynchinae for the genus Prosorhynchus and Bucephalinae for the genera Bucephalus, Bucephalopsis and Rhipidocotyle. Ozaki [1924, and 1928] followed Nicoll's classification and added three new genera, Gotonius, Nannoenteron and Dolichoenteron. Issaitschikow [1928] proposed the genus Skrjabinella for Prosorhynchus aculeatus Odhner, 1905. In 1931, Pigulewsky described a new genus Mordvilkovia elongata, and created a new tribe Gotonia, but the classification proposed by this author does not appear to be based on sound grounds. The following year Eckmann [1932] published a critical study of the group and, in the light of the anterior adhesive structure of Rhipidoco- tyle baculum which possesses both a sucker and a structure homologous to a rhynchus, pointed out the untenability of the subfamilies Bucephalinae and Prosorhynchinae, which were based on the presence of a sucker or rhynchus. She regarded Gotonius and Nannoenteron as synonyms of Prosorhynchus and Rhipidocotyle respectively. Manter [1934] considered Skrjabinella as a synonym of Prosorhynchus. Yamaguti [1934] maintained the genus Gotonius in spite of Eckmann's opinion. (317) H

Linton in 1910 described a trematode as Gasterostomum sp. from the gut of Sphyraena barracuda which probably has a crown of four tentacles in con- nection with its anterior sucker. Linton's description of this parasite is ex- tremely meagre. The new species, B. gangeticus, resembles the American species only in the number of its tentacles, in case the latter has really four tentacles. However, a careful study of the description and the figure given by Linton shows that the Indian species differs from the American form in most of its characters, such as, shape of body, topography of gonads, position of vitellaria, extent of uterus and cirrus sac, besides differences in measurements, BUCEPHALUS BARINA, N.

But as Mr. Verma claimed to have collected his material earlier than the author, the paper was with- drawn. The species B. garuai is represented in the author's collection by a large number of specimens obtained from the gut of Silundia gangetica which was found to be nearly always infested with these flukes. Often the infestation was found to be very heavy. The number of specimens collected from a single host varied from 20 to 860. The specimens from Silundia gangetica resemble those from Pseudotropius garua described by Verma but for slight differences in measurements as given on p. 329. The author's specimens differ from Verma's in the number of vitelline follicles and the anterior extent of vitellaria, in the shape of excretory bladder and the absence of a muscular sphincter around the genital pore.

AN OUTBREAK OF EQUINE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS IN A MOUNTED MILITARY POLICE TROOP IN BIHAR A PRELIMINARY REPORT BY LAKSHMI SAHAI, M.Sc, M.R.C.V.S. (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer, Bihar (Received for publication on 14th April, 1938) INTRODUCTION THERE occurs in many parts of India and certain neighbouring countries a disease of horses known as Kumri which is characterized by incoordination of movement and loss of control over the hind limbs. The disease has been under investigation for a very long time but its etiology still remains obs- cure. There also occurs on the continent of Europe and in America a group of diseases of virus origin characterized by symptoms of paraplegia and cerebral involvement. Of these, the best known is Borna disease which has existed in Germany for over a hundred years. An analogous disease occurs in France which has been described by Moussu and Marchand [1924]. The disease in America referred to as equine encephalomyelitis was first described by Meyer and his associates [1930] in California and they showed that it was due to a virus, of which there are two immunologically distinct strains, the original western strain of Meyer which is supposed to be identical with the strain causing equine encephalomyelitis in Argentine, and an eastern strain first described by Ten Broeck and Merrill [1933], the latter being the more virulent. In addition there is a Russian strain responsible for the disease in horses in Russia. Several other types of equine encephalomyelitis have also been described mostly from the continent of Europe, but it is extremely doubtful if there is any relationship between them and whether they are all of virus origin. In this country, cases of disease in horses, characterized by symptoms of paraplegia, have in the past been either diagnosed as Kumri or attributed to a variety of unproved etiological factors, while no evidence was available until quite recently that the specific form of equine encephalomyelitis such as occurs in America and elsewhere also occurred in this country. (341) L
342 An Outbreak of Equine Encephalomyelitis. The first outbreak of encephalomyelitis in which a virus was suspected to be the cause occurred in a cavalry regiment at Multan in the winter of 1933 The disease was investigated by Mosley, Heane and Shirlaw [1934], the last- named of whom adduced evidence to show that it was very closely related to the American type of equine encephalomyelitis and that it was probably caused by a neurotropic filterable virus of organotropic type. Recently a similar outbreak has been described from Kashmir by Kak [1937] and the close clinical similarity between this outbreak and the one at Multan suggests that probably it too was of virus origin. Within recent years several outbreaks of equine encephalomyelitis have been reported, mostly from military establishments in the Punjab, and fre- quent references to it are to be found in the recent reports of the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute at Mukteswar and of the Army Veterinary Service in India, but there is nothing to show that the existence of a virus in these outbreaks was proved. In this article an account is given of an outbreak of paraplegia, later diagnosed as encephalomyelitis, that occurred among the Mounted Military Police horses at Jamshedpur during the winter of 1936-37 and which bore some resemblance to the outbreaks at Multan and in Kashmir but in which the existence of a virus could not be definitely proved. An attempt to con- nect the outbreak with vegetable poisoning also proved abortive, while ex- amination of the blood and fodder for their calcium and phosphorus contents did not reveal any abnormality of such an exceptional nature as to justify any definite conclusions. As a matter of fact, the etiology of the disease has up to now remained undetermined. In this connection it is important to note that a similar outbreak has again occurred among these horses this year (1937-38), the first case occurring towards the end of October and the last towards the beginning of January. Of the total number of six horses attacked, four recovered and two are going to be destroyed. Similar cases of a sporadic nature have also been reported from among the Mounted Military Police horses at Patna and some privately- owned horses in North Bihar. These last-named are also Walers except for two which are country-breds. The description which follows relates only to the outbreak which occurred during the winter of 1936-37 except where otherwise specifically mentioned. HISTORY OF THE OUTBREAK There are five troops of the Mounted Military Police horses in Bihar, of which three are stationed at Arrah, one at Patna and one at Jamshedpur. Each troop comprises twenty-eight horses and the troops exchange places once every year. The horses are all of the Waler breed. The Mounted Military Police station at Jamshedpur was first established in May 1933 and the troop in which this particular outbreak occurred had been there since October, 1935.
LAKSHMI SAHAI 343 The first case with any symptoms of paraplegia or loss of control over the hind limbs among the Mounted Military Police horses at Jamshedpur occurred in August, 1935. This animal while out on exercise one day went suddenly lame, the symptoms being so acute that it could be walked back to the lines with the greatest difficulty. Later, the acute pain passed off and symptoms of paraplegia were manifested which became progressively worse. Since it was an isolated case and the symptoms shown bore some resemblance to those seen in Kumri, a diagnosis of the latter disease was given and the animal destroyed. In the meantime the troop was changed and no further cases occurred until the present outbreak started in August, 1936, exactly one year after the case in 1935. The first horse to be attacked during this outbreak was No. 119 which one day about the middle of August was seen to be going definitely unsound in the hind quarters. During September, 1936, another horse No. 31 developed the symptoms as evidenced by the dragging of the off-hind toe at the trot. This case was variously diagnosed by officers on the spot as string- halt or Kumri. Later in the month of October cases arose with greater frequency, as many as five horses being attacked. These were Nos. 2, 52, 8, 70 and 12. During this month the private pony of the Commandant of the troop which had been in contact with the Mounted Military Police horses, while away at Ranchi for races, also developed the disease. On the 29th October, it was noticed to be off colour and refused to lie down. The follow- ing day the condition became worse and definite signs of paraplegia became visible. The animal was brought back to Jamshedpur where it became progressively worse and had to be destroyed three months later. During the month of November horse No. 29 was attacked and during December No. 13, after which for three months no further cases occurred, when suddenly in March, 1937, another horse No. 39 developed the disease. This was the last case to occur and though the healthy and affected horses continued to remain in close contact due to lack of facilities for proper segregation, there was no further spread of the disease. In this connection it may be stated that two horses, belonging to an officer at Patna, which had also been to Ranchi and had come in contact with the Commandant's horse developed, on arrival at Patna, symptoms very similar to those exhibited by the Mounted Military Police horses at Jamshedpur, while isolated cases of the disease also occurred in the troops at Patna and Arrah which had never been in contact with any of the other affected horses. Of the eleven Mounted Military Police horses attacked at Jamshedpur including the Commandant's, two recovered (Nos. 8 and 13), two died after periods of illness lasting for a month and a fortnight respectively (Nos. 52 and 12), while seven had to be destroyed after they had been kept under observation and treatment for several months (Nos. 31, 2, 70, 119, 29, 39 and the Commandant's).
344 An Outbreak of Equine Encephalomyelitis It will thus be seen that of a total number of twenty-nine horses in the troop (including the Commandant's) eleven developed signs of paraplegia, of which two recovered and the rest died or were destroyed ; the incidence and mortality rate thus working out as 38 and 82 per cent respectively. The following statement giving the numbers of horses and the dates on which they were attacked will show the incidence of the disease in this troop :LAKSHMI SAHAI 345 The following table compiled from information gathered locally will show the losses from this disease at Jamshedpur during the last few years :346 An Outbreak of Equine Encephalomyelitis After these cerebral symptoms had subsided, the animal developed hemiplegia with a tendency to go round in a circle. The condition of the animal got steadily worse and it succumbed three weeks later. In most cases, the symptoms of paraplegia were seen to progress only to a point after which they became stationary. There was no loss of appetite or other disturbance of health and such animals would perhaps have lived indefinitely, had they not been destroyed. It may be stated that while a febrile phase of a few days' duration, prior to the onset of symptoms of paresis, is considered to be a characteristic feature of equine encephalomyelitis of virus origin, in none of the horses which were involved in this outbreak was any rise of temperature at any stage of the disease noted (except in No. 12 already referred to, the result probably of violent struggling and excitement). The outbreak that occurred during the winter of 1937-38 was also characterized by an entire absence of any pyrexial phase, a feature which serves to distinguish these outbreaks sharply from those which occurred at Multan and in Kashmir. In practically all cases there was some degree of retention of the urine amounting in the worst affected cases to complete suppression. In the majority of cases the urine was definitely thick and gluey due to the presence of a large amount of mucus and this character is of some diagnostic importance. None of the animals revealed any interference with the function of the anal sphincter. In one case the paralysis also involved the retractor muscles of the penis which used to hang down out of the sheath. Swelling of the near hind fetlock was seen in one case, while one case (No. 13) also showed, coincident with the attack of paraplegia, a filaria worm in the near eye which, however, disappeared before any operative treatment could be carried out. Later, this animal went completely blind in this eye, though it recovered from the paraplegia. A similar worm was also seen in another horse, involved in the 1937-38 outbreak, but its removal failed to bring about any amelioration of the symp- toms. In all the animals the appetite remained normal throughout and though some of them were kept under observation for months, none showed any signs of muscular atrophy or skin lesions, indicative of trophic disturbances. There was no loss of sensation in the hind limbs in any of the animals nor was any hypersensitiveness elicited on application of pressure over the loins. Briefly summarized, the symptoms in the majority of the animals were mainly those of paraplegia of varying degrees combined with the retention, either partial or complete, of urine in the worst affected cases. In acute cases, the brain was also affected, especially in the earlier stages.
LAKSHMI SAHAI 347 TREATMENT Routine treatment with potassium iodide, Nux Vomica, arsenic, etc., com- bined with other symptomatic treatment was carried out in all cases but without any beneficial results. Two horses (Nos. 8 and 13) in which the attack was relatively mild recovered but recovery in these animals may have been spontaneous rather than due to any treatment adopted. On the assumption that the trouble might prove to be encephalomyelitis (of virus origin), before the results of transmission experiments were known, the treatment of all the affected animals was carried out on the lines adopted by Mosley, Heane and Shirlaw [1934] in the Multan outbreak but without any appreciable benefit. Cases which occurred subsequently were also treated in the same way. This treatment was as follows :348 An Outbreak of Equine Encephalomyelitis The liver was found to be fatty in two cases, while congestion and petechial haemorrhages were seen in the kidneys in practically all cases. In all cases in which there was no retention of the urine the bladder was found to be normal, but in those with any degree of suppression of the urine it was either found to be enormously distended or shrunken in size to a small volume, with a greatly- thickened wall due to infiltration with new granulomatous tissue, consequent on the irritation set up by cystitis. In such cases the bladder contained only a small quantity of a thick oily urine of an offensive odour and with a quantity of a thick greenish-coloured sediment composed of precipitated mineral matter adhering to the mucosa, which on its removal was found to be thickly studded with haemorrhages. Exactly similar changes in the bladder had been seen in horse No. 80 which had been attacked in 1935. The brains and spinal cords of all the animals that were destroyed were carefully examined but except for a few petechial haemorrhages, here and there, in the cord and some evidence of softening especially in the lumbar region not much in the way of naked-eye changes was seen. HISTOPATHOLOGICAL CHANGES Pathological tissues from a number of cases were sent to Mukteswar for histological examination. The findings were more or less identical in each case and they may be briefly summarized as follows :LAKSHMI SAHAI 349 DIAGNOSIS, RESULTS OF TRANSMISSION EXPERIMENTS, ETC. By the time the author arrived on the scene eight horses had already been affected and two of these were in a moribund condition. These died on the subsequent day. The clinical picture presented by the animals, the post mortem findings, the course of the disease and the occurrence of so many cases within such a short space of time suggested the possibility of some infective agent at work and equine encephalomyelitis was suspected. Material was at once forwarded to Mukteswar for biological examination as no facilities for such examination existed locally and at the same time hexamine treatment of the remaining horses was started which as already stated proved ineffective. Meanwhile, other possible causes of the trouble were thought of and in this connection the possibility of vegetable poisoning seemed to merit especial consideration in view of the common belief among the people in the locality that grass obtained from a certain farm was in some way connected with causing symptoms such as were seen in these horses, a possibility which could not be entirely ruled out in view of the well-known existence of certain plants which can exercise a poisonous effect on the central nervous system and the fact that although the Mounted Military Police horses at Jamshedpur are maintained ordinarily on hay, bran and oats with boiled linseed once a week, this year partly with a view to conserving the supplies of hay and partly with a view to supplying some sort of green stuff to the animals of which they are ordinarily completely deprived, these horses had for sometime before the outbreak started been fed on grasses obtained from this particular farm (lucerne, guinea-grass and ordinary grass) and continued to be so fed for some- time afterwards. Chemical examination of the grasses, however, failed to reveal any poison. This was at first regarded as not entirely to exclude the possibility of vegetable poisoning as by the time samples of these grasses were collected, they had so completely changed their texture that it was considered not improbable that any poisons present might have disappeared. In this connection it is interesting to note that though no grass either from this farm or any other source is being fed, the disease has recurred this year (1937-38) among these horses with exactly similar clinical manifestations to those seen before. Coming to the question of an infective agent, Mukteswar found that of two rabbits and two guinea-pigs inoculated sub-durally with brain material from one of the affected horses, both the rabbits failed to develop the infection while of the guinea-pigs one died after showing paraplegic symptoms and the other survived after a febrile reaction. Similar results had been obtained by Shirlaw [1934] in the Multan outbreak and this led the author to suspect that probably a virus was the etiological factor concerned, but unfortunately Mukteswar was unable to repeat the results when supplied with some further material from two horses later. In this connection, however, it is necessary to mention that this material had been taken from horses which had been affected for about a year and, therefore, the possibility of such material hav- ing become avirulent cannot be entirely ignored. M
350 An Outbreak of Equine Encephalomyelitis A pony injected by the author locally with 10 c. c. of brain emulsion from a horse that had been destroyed after a severe illness lasting for about three months also failed to develop the disease, while an attempt to infect another pony by injecting it intrathecally and intranasally with 40-50 c. c. of cerebro- spinal fluid taken from horses involved in the 1937-38 outbreak yielded no better results. It will thus be seen that the results of transmission experiments on guinea- pigs, rabbits and ponies have been too uncertain and inconsistent to justify any definite conclusions about the virus origin of the malady, though in view of the known difficulty of transmitting equine encephalomyelitis experi- mentally, such a possibility cannot be entirely excluded. Nevertheless, one cannot help thinking that if a virus was the real cause of the trouble the per- centage of successes should have been greater than that obtained in the ex- perimental transmission work. It is also well known that in carrying out experiments with brain tissue great care is necessary both with regard to the technique and the material used as otherwise quite misleading results may be obtained. It is proposed to carry out further experiments when some of the horses involved in the present outbreak (1937-38) are destroyed. The possibility of a mineral imbalance as a factor in the etiology of the condition has not been overlooked and at the request of the Imperial Veteri- nary Research Institute, Mukteswar, which is engaged in an investigation of this disease and other similar diseases from this point of view, samples of serum and fodder were supplied for analysis, but the results so far to hand do not reveal any abnormality in the calcium and phosphorus contents of these materials of such a consistent nature as to warrant any definite conclusions. It is proposed to pursue the investigation from this point of view as and when opportunity occurs. While on this subject, the possibility of cold as a probable factor in the causation of the condition must be mentioned, for it was observed that the majority of the cases in the 1936-37 outbreak (as also those in the 1937-38 outbreak) were among horses tethered on the side of the stables exposed to the cold westerly winds, while very few cases were seen among horses tied on the other side. It is not improbable that cold acts as an important predispos- ing factor in the causation of the condition, tending to lower the vitality of the animal and rendering it susceptible to attack by the specific cause whatever that might be. Support is lent to this view by the fact that in both the out- breaks which have occurred at Jamshedpur so far the disease has shown a definite seasonal incidence. The first cases are usually seen to arise about October or November and the disease tends spontaneously to subside about February or March with the onset of the warmer weather. The outbreaks at Multan and in Kashmir also occurred during the colder part of the year though the exact relationship between them and the disease in this Province has not
LAKSHMI SAHAI 351 been established. It must, however, be admitted that the greater incidence of the disease at this time of the year may be explained on other grounds as well. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION In the foregoing, an account has been given of an outbreak of equine encephalomyelitis among the Mounted Military Police horses at Jamshedpur in the year 1936-37 supported by brief references to another outbreak in 1937-38, and of the steps taken to establish a diagnosis. The possibility of a virus, of vegetable poisoning and of mineral imbalance in the causation of the condition has been discussed but the results have either been wholly negative or not sufficiently definite to justify one in pronouncing a definite opinion. Certain points of resemblance between this outbreak and those at Multan and in Kashmir have been stressed. At the same time attention has been drawn to the important points of difference between them, such as the absence of a definite pyrexial phase in the outbreaks in this Province, the almost negative results of transmission experiments, and the disappointing results obtained with hexamine treatment which was reported to have given good results in the Multan and Kashmir outbreaks, especially in the latter. It is not improb- able that the encephalomyelitis occurring in this Province is not a virus malady at all, but one due to some other cause.

DISEASES TRANSMITTED BY THE INDIAN SPECIES OF TICKS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR PREVEN- TION THROUGH BIOLOGICAL CONTROL* BY M. SHARIF, D.Sc. (PANJAB),PH.D. (CANTAB.), F.L.S. (LOND.) Entomologist Haffkine Institute, Parel, Bombay (Received for publication on 17th May, 1938) INTRODUCTION COMPARED with what is known in other countries about tick-borne diseases, very little appears to be on record in India. As to the amount of loss due to tick-borne diseases in India there is no record. In a country, where no importance is attached to the loss of human life through diseases trasmitted by arthropods, one should not expect any consideration for cattle and other domestic animals. This article is not intended to be an exclusively original contribution, but it is put forward in the hope of enlisting further active in- terest in these parasites and the diseases which they transmit in India. India offers a rich field for investigators to study the various aspects of tick- borne diseases which have hitherto remained unsolved, and which are unques- tionably of vital importance to the stock-breeders. The tick fauna of India as in other tropical and sub-tropical countries is very rich and is represented by eleven genera and about seventy species. They are found on all kinds of domestic and wild animals like mammals, birds, snakes, lizards and tortoises, and they also attack man. Economically nine species listed in Appendix A are of considerable importance. They attack, the domestic animals in India in large numbers and thus they are the chief live-stock pests. In addition there are twenty-six species listed in Appendix B, which have been found on domestic animals but nobody knows as to the importance of the rôle they play in the economy of domestic animals in nature. Very little is known as to the life-history of even the commonest species and the rôle they play in the spread of diseases in India. The number of Indian species is larger than that which is recorded from the United States of America, where about forty species have been listed so far [Bishopp, 1935]. In the latter country the tick problem attracted attention as early as the last decade of the nineteenth century ; with the result that a large number of workers took interest in ticks, and with the increase of the knowledge of them a progressively large number of tick- borne diseases began to be known. Keeping in view, the ecological conditions * Read at the Silver Jubilee Session of the Indian Science Congress Association at Calcutta, 1938. (353)
354 Diseases Transmitted by the Indian Species of Ticks of India which are more favourable to the increase of the population of ticks, and the larger number of the Indian species, the present author is of the opinion that the tick problem is as, if not more serious in India than it is in the United States of America, where an enormous amount of money is spent every year upon the control of ticks alone. The following is an attempt to review the existing information about the diseases transmitted by species of ticks found in India, but as the records of tick-borne diseases from India are few, the author has incorporated all those cases which have been reported from outside India, as there can al- ways be a possibility in a vast country like India of some of the diseases being never brought to the notice of competent persons. With the rapid mode of transport like aeroplanes there is always a possibility of the transference of infected ticks from outside, as they can live without food for a long time. According to Nuttall [ 1908 ], " Ticks imported from India and Africa have transmitted the disease to dogs in England, and ticks imported from Africa have transmitted piroplasmosis to cattle in England." There is every pos- sibility of the fresh introduction of some of the diseases in India. DISEASES TRANSMITTED BY INDIAN TICKS The importance of ticks in general as transmitting agents of various diseases of man and domesticated animals continues to become more mani- fest as our knowledge of them increases. In man they transmit the causative agents of the relapsing fever (spirochaetosis) all over the world, the rickettsial diseases like Tick typhus fever, Marseilles fever, and the Rocky Mountain spotted fever of America and Tularaemia. In domesticated animals they transmit diseases caused by Babesia Starcovici (M. SHARIF 355 when the immunity, obtained by cattle as young calves, is broken down, such as is liable to occur through the effects of intercurrent disease condition due to for example, rinderpest (P. 358) or exposure to adverse conditions '. According to Sturgess [ 1929 ], this disease is very common in Ceylon amongst low-country cattle. Severe symptoms are rare except when cattle are weakened by food shortage, etc. Haemaphysalis bispinosa Neumann, a species very common in India, is incriminated to transmit this disease in Australia [ Fielding, 1926 ]. Babesia bovis Starcovici the causal agent of the European Red-water fever is transmitted in all the countries of Europe by Ixodes ricinus (Linnaeus) and in some European countries by Haemaphysalis cinnabarina var. punctata (Canestrini and Fanzago) also. Both these species have been recorded from the Western Himalayas but the disease according to Cooper [ 1926 ], has not been reported from India. The mortality due to this disease varies from 6 to 60 per cent. According to Sergent Donatien, Parrot and Lestoquard [ 1928 ], B. berbera (Sergent, Donatien, Parrot, Lestoquard, Plantureux and Rougebief) is transmitted by Boophilus annulatus subsp. calcaratus (Birula) which is found in India, in Algeria. The piroplasmosis of sheep and goat is due to Babesia motasi Wenyon and B. sergenti Wenyon. The disease due to B. motasi is dangerous and has been reported from Mysore State by Achar and Srikantiah [ 1934 ] in sheep which were infested with Haemaphysalis bispinosa. They found this parasite normally non-pathogenic in some sheep but it became pathogenic during the attack of rinderpest. B. sergenti was found in the blood of goats in India by Krishna Iyer [ 1932 ]. It produces no recognizable symptoms in sheep and goats. The equine piroplasmosis or biliary fever in India is due to two species, Babesia caballi (Nuttall) and B. equi (Laveran). According to Valladares [1914], both of them are possibly transmitted in India by Hyalomma (Hya- lomma) aegyptium. B. equi is found in mules and donkeys and Lingard and Jennings [ 1904 ] have reported this parasite from camels in India. The disease known as malignant jaundice of dogs is caused by Babesia canis (Piana and Galli-Valerio) and has a wide distribution in the old world including India. It frequently terminates fatally. Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Latreille) transmits this disease in India and Haemaphysalis leachi (Audouin), which is also found in India, in Africa. B. gibsoni (Patton), which was first reported from the Madras hounds, produces infection in jackals and dogs. Sen [ 1933 ] suggests the possibility of its transmission by R , sanguineus. Carpano [ 1929 ] suggests that piroplasmosis in fowl due to Egyptianella pullorum Carpano is transmitted by Argas persicus (Oken), a species found in India, in Egypt. Theileriosis.356 Diseases Transmitted by the Indian Species of Ticks A benign type of theileriosis, due to T. mutans (Theiler) is widely distribut- ed in the warmer countries of the world. According to Cooper [ 1926 ], it is almost universally present in India. It is harmless, but under certain conditions especially when it infects cattle from regions considered to be free from theilerio- sis it has proved fatal. Infection due to this in adult cattle proves fatal only in 5 to 10 per cent cases. Both Hyalomma (Hyalomma) aegyptium and Boophilus auslralis are incriminated in India to be transmitters of this disease. According to Sen and Srinivasan [1937], the causal agents of the acute or fatal theileriosis in India are two forms. One is closely allied to T. annulata (Dschun- kowsky and Luhs) and other to T. dispar Sergent, Donatien, Parrot, Lesto- quard, Plantureux and Rougebief. The first form according to them is exotic in origin, and the second one is indigenous and was responsible for a morta- lity rate of nearly 76 per cent in bulls under experimental conditions. A dangerous parasite T. hirci Dschunkowsky and Urodschevich is found in sheep and goats of India [ Sarwar, 1935 and Bhatia, 1936 ]. According to Rastegaieff [ 1935, 1936, 1 and 1936, 2 ] Ornithodoros lahorensis Neumann can transmit T. ovis (=recondita) in sheep of Azerbaijan. Anaplasmosis.M. SHARIF 357 who is not well versed in ticks. The present author had since long suspicion that D. auratus is the real vector of the Tick typhus fever in India and R . haemaphysaloides may play some part in the transmission of the disease. Marseilles fever (la fièvre boutonneuse), whose causal agent is Rickettsia conori Brumpt, is transmitted by R. sanguineus [Brumpt, 1930] and has been reported from several places on the Mediterranean coast. The tropical Tick typhus fever in Kenya according to Roberts [ 1935 ] is also transmitted by R. sanguineus. This disease according to Symes and Roberts [1936] is identical with Marseilles fever. Rocky Mountain spotted fever which is due to Dermacentroxenus rickettsi (Wolbach) is present in thirteen states of the United States of America, where according to Cooley [ 1932 ], more than 4,260 persons have suffered up to 1928 from this disease with an average mortality of about 17.11 per cent. According to Parker, Philip and Jellison [1933] the transmission tests of this disease with R. sanguineus over a period of two years have shown that it is a very efficient vector under experimental conditions. Spirochaetosis.358 Diseases Transmitted by the Indian Species of Ticks plague experimentally by A. persicus at Saratov. The causal agent remained alive and effective up to 110 days in the body of the tick. Tick paralysis.M. SHARIF 359 their effects in limiting the increase of population of ticks will yield fruitful results. Regarding the effects of predaceous animals on ticks no organised and systematic attempt has ever been made except here and there one comes across names of a few birds which partially feed on ticks. As regards the parasitic enemies a serious attempt by highly trained persons is being made at present at Montana where a research laboratory costing about sixty thou- sand dollars was specially built for this purpose in 1927 [Cooley, 1929, 3]. To quote Cooley [1932 ] " At the present time the use of tick parasites seems to offer the most promising method ". So far the parasites of ticks that we know of, all have been discovered by chance in connection with other work. Special efforts should be directed at finding the enemies of ticks. De Jesus [1934 ] found experimentally that gordura grass (Melinis minuti- flora) has a distinctly repellent effect on the larvae of B. australis. They die in forty to sixty days on the blades and. fifteen to thirty days on the leaf sheaths. He believes in the possibility of producing a tick-free pasture by planting gordura grass and allowing ninety days to elapse after grazing of infected cattle. The predaceous enemies of ticks.360 Diseases Transmitted by the Indian Species of Ticks has been recorded from the United States of America, Mexico, Cuba, France, Southern India [ Cooley, 1929, 2], Indo-China, Portuguese East Africa and South Africa. Africa has been considered the original home of this parasite. According to Bequarter [ 1930 ] in France, it parasitises the nymphs of I. ricinus and larvae and nymphs of the genera of Haemaphysails, Rhipice- phalus and Dermacentor. This parasite was introduced for the purposes of biological control of ticks in 1926 [ Cooley, 1927, 1929, 1 ], in Naushan, a small island near Woods Hole under the supervision of Dr. F. Larrousse from the laboratory of Prof. E. Brumpt of Paris. The control of ticks by this parasite was seriously taken up in 1927 by the Montana State Board of Entomology. In 1928 Cooley [ 1934 ] undertook a tour in South Africa in search of parasites of ticks and he found that this parasite attacks readily the nymphs of Hyalomma (Hyalomma) aegyptium subsp. impressum in Transvaal and Haemaphysalis leachi. The work of control through this parasite is still in progress with promising results in Montana. Hunter and Hooker [ 1907 ] have bred a species of Phoridae from the eggs of B. annulatus in Texas. The present author has also reared a species of Phoridae in 1925 from the parasitised ticks belonging to the species A. persicus from Pusa. The specific identity of this could not be made. CONCLUSION It is a well-known fact that the work of extermination of ticks must be preceded by and be based upon a knowledge of life-histories of ticks, their habits and the manner in which they are affected by the climatic conditions and destroyed by their natural enemies. Such work has been done extensively in the United States of America and some other countries. According to Nuttall [1913], wherever this type of work has been carried out intelligently, highly beneficial results have been obtained and " large tracts of country in the United States, Australia and. Africa have been rendered almost tick-free by these measures ". In the same way, it is possible to control ticks in India. A list of tick- eating birds and other animals may be prepared and a correct estimate of their efficiency in control of ticks may be made. The common crow and maina Acridotheres tristis tristis (Linnaeus) have been observed by the author to feed on ticks on cattle. The Indian Cattle Egret, Bubulcus ibis coromandus (Boddart) also feeds on ticks. The natural enemies of ticks should be encour- aged in every possible way and domestic fowls should be kept in cattle pens. The possibility of tick control through the agency of parasitic enemies has proved promising. An organised effort for the search of parasites of ticks may be made. H. hookeri which as mentioned above is found in India and it may be utilised for the control of ticks on proper lines.

INTRODUCTION THE present inquiry on the warble-fly infestation in domesticated animals in India was undertaken in January 1937, at the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, under a research scheme sanctioned by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. This article deals mainly with some observations made, during a period of about seven months, on the life-history of Hypoderma lineatum at Mukteswar, in the Kumaun hills (altitude 7,500 ft.), and its effect on the general condition of the host and also the incidence of infection in one particular type of cattle (hill bulls) in India. Opportunity is also taken for embodying herein a few incidental observations concerning the distribution of the pest in certain locali- ties in the Punjab, in order to illustrate the diversity of habits exhibited by it under varying conditions of topography and climate, for, as will be seen from what has to be stated later, the seasonal occurrence of H. lineatum in these localities is not synchronous with what has been observed in the case of this pest in the Kumaun hills. One can hardly over-estimate the importance of observations of this kind in formulating combative measures against the pest. II. PERCENTAGE OF INFESTATION IN HILL BULLS Recent observations have indicated that H. lineatum is indigenous to Mukteswar and its neighbouring localities in the Kumaun hills. This is borne out by the fact that during last winter warble tumours appeared in dairy cows (375)
376 Bionomics of the Ox Warble-Fly born and bred at Mukteswar, whilst towards the end of April 1937, the writer actually observed what appeared to be an adult H. lineatum in a locality adjoining Naini Tal (altitude 5,000 ft.) but which unfortunately he was unable to secure. Additional evidence in support of this statement is provided by the fact that the oesophageal forms of H. lineatum larvae have been recovered, during July 1937, from bulls maintained at Mukteswar since October 1936. In January 1937, a systematic survey was undertaken with a view to obtaining an indication as to the extent of warble-fly infestation in hill bulls at Mukteswar, including those housed in the out-kraals of the station. In all, 372 bulls were examined, out of which 198 (53.23 per cent) showed warble tumours in their backs, the maximum number of warble tumours observed in a single animal being fifty-three. Nearly fifty-five mature larvae were pressed out from some of these tumours and all of these were identified as Hypoderma lineatum, which so far has been the only species of Hypoderma recorded in this locality. From the foregoing figures, it would appear that H. lineatum is well estab- lished in the Kumaun hills, and it would be of interest to enquire into the possible factors that determine the occurrence of this pest at such high altitudes. It is worthy of note that similar observations have also been recorded in the United States of America by Bishopp and his collaborators [1926], for, according to these authors, warble-flies seem to thrive well in fairly high altitudes, this being specially true with Hypoderma lineatum, which is known to be abundant at elevations above 7,000 ft. The evidence so far available would seem to suggest that the pest is not influencedB. N. SONI 377 been noted in the two neighbouring localities of Naini Tal and Ranikhet during April and May respectively. It may be mentioned that the bulls examined at Mukteswar were brought from Garhwal (altitude 4,000 ft.) about four to six months previously, and that one of the oxen, which showed oesophageal larvae at Naini Tal, was brought from Muzaffarnagar (Western U. P.), while the bulls at Ranikhet were imported from Lucknow only a few days before they were slaughtered. On the basis of the available evidence concerning the length of the different stages in the life-cycle of H. lineatum, the oesophageal larvae appearing in the end of March and early April should be the progeny of adult flies that were on the wing in the latter part of January378 Bionomics of the Ox Warble-Fly larvae, and when punctured, yield watery disintegrated tissues. What, however, appeared to be definitely a spineless form of the larva was encoun- tered by the present writer on two occasions in infected animals at Mukteswar. This form shows an entire absence of spines except on the anterior and posterior segments. The cephalopharyngeal skeleton and mouth hooks are morpholo- gically similar to those of the oesophageal stage larva of H. lineatum. It differs from the oesophageal larva in being club-shaped instead of torpedo- shaped, whilst the segmentation is more pronounced and the surface less glossy (Figs. 1-3). Unfortunately, both specimens were damaged while being mounted in Berlese's medium. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Fig. 1. Oesophageal larva. ×11.

B. N. SONI 379 V. THE EFFECT OF INFESTATION ON THE CONDITION OF THE HOST Five heavily " warbled " and two warble-free bulls were kept under identical conditions of housing and feeding, and their body weights were taken weekly for nearly three months, from February to April 1937. As will be seen from Table II, the " warbled " bulls continued to lose weight until about the middle of March, which is about the time when the majority of the larvae at Mukteswar escape from their warbles, and from this time onwards they showed a progressive increase in their body weight. No appreciable loss in weight was observed in the two control animals. These observations are in accord with those recorded by MacDougall [1935] in Scotland, who observes that the " condition [of animals] suffers from the presence of a number of larvae in the subdermal tissues ". TABLE II Tabulated records showing the loss of body weight in "warbled" animals The numbers marked with asterisk represent control (uninfested) bulls.

During 1937, the occurrence of oesophageal forms of H. lineatum was noticed for the first time at Mukteswar towards the end of March and thence- forward they were encountered continuously during an observation period of nearly seven months. The significance of their occurrence over such a long period is not understood and it would appear difficult to reconcile this with the generally accepted view that there is only one annual brood of H. lineatum in India. Evidence has been obtained that the presence of warble tumours results in a loss of condition of the affected animal.

H. D. SRIVASTAVA 383 the third pair lie one on either side in the equatorial region of the body. The ducts of the third pair of flame cells open into those of the anterior pair. The ducts of the anterior and posterior pairs of flame cells join on either side to form a common duct which swells into a bladder. The excretory pores are situated laterally close behind the middle of body length. The rediae after leaving the sporocyst migrate into the liver and ovotestis of the host where they complete their development. The formation of daughter rediae though not common has been observed in a few cases. The cercariae belong to the ' pigmentata group . They leave the rediae through the birth pore in an immature stage and complete their development in the tissues of the host. Fully developed cercariae begin to come out thirty to thirty-five days after the infestation of the snail with miracidia. In their internal structure the cercariae resemble closely Cercariae indicae XXIX Sewell, 1922, but differ from it in the size of the body which is smaller and in the presence of a feebly developed envelop of the circular muscle fibres around the base of the oesophagus. Like the miracidia, the cercariae are also strongly heliotropic. They begin to come out in large numbers when the aquarium containing the infested snails is kept in the sun. The largest number of cercariae is shed between 10 A.M. and 4 P.M. After a brief active period, the cercaria contracts into a small, spherical mass around which a thin cyst wall is secreted and the tail is cast off. The cysts are hemispherical in shape and deep gray in colour. The larvae readily encyst on the sides of the con- tainer and on suspended vegetation. In these experiments leaves of tamarind and banian trees were provided. A number of leaves bearing large numbers of encysted metacercariae were fed to two out of four parasite-free and laboratory- raised goats, the other two remaining as controls. Four months after feeding the metacercariae the animals showed symptoms of acute amphistomiasis to which one of them succumbed. On post mortem examination numerous im- mature amphistomes were found embedded in the wall of the duodenum and the initial part of the intestine. The other infested and the two controls were slaughtered six months later and adult specimens of C otylophoron cotylophorum were obtained from the rumen of the first, while the last two were free from amphistomes. Feeding experiments were carried out to determine the span of life of the encysted metacercariae kept under suitable conditions of temperature and moisture. A large number of leaves containing freshly encysted metacercariae was kept in small moist chambers at room temperature for a period of five months. Parasite-free lambs were given two, three, three and a half, four and five months old cysts and it was found on subsequent examination that the encysted metacercariae remain viable for a maximum period of four months. It was observed that while most of the three months old metacercariae develop- ed in the host only a few out of the four months old cysts could develop into adults.
384 Cotylophoron cotylophorum ATHOGENICITY Until recently amphistomes were regarded as perfectly innocuous para- sites. While discussing ' Gillar' in his article on ' Some problems in sheep diseases', Baldery in 1906 points out that clinically it somewhat resembles fascioliasis. In describing the pathological lesions he states, " The really pathogenic lesions will be seen in the small and large intestine, noticeably so in the pyloric region of the former. Here there will be seen an enteritis, the mucous membranes being necrotic and probably shredding off in places..... The veins in these areas will have quite a varicose appearance ". He collected amphistomes " in an undeveloped state " from the haemorrhagic areas. Though he states, " In subsequent post mortem examinations, the presence of immature amphistomes was found to be constant and always in the diseased duodenum and pylorus ", nevertheless he did not suspect these parasites as the causal agents and remarked, " It is supposed that these organisms have not a very serious effect ". Speaking of the ovine disease ' Gillar ', Walker, [1906], pointed out that it is practically confined to the low-lying swampy areas and that usually the malady is at its worst during the months of December, January and February. Le Roux [1930] investigated two serious outbreaks of amphistomiasis due to C otylophoron cotylophorum in the Orange Free State. In the first outbreak thirty per cent and in the second, fifty per cent of the flock had died. Pande [1935] reported an outbreak of amphistomiasis in cattle in Assam. On being ingested by suitable hosts the encysted metacercariae excyst in the duodenum and the initial part of the intestine and the immature amphis- tomes attach themselves firmly to the mucosa. Later, they migrate to the rumen to mature and oviposit. It has been observed by the author that the amphistomes are pathogenic only so long as they are in the duodenum and the intestine and become apparently innocuous on migrating to the rumen. The infested animals in the above experiments appeared dull, weak and anaemic. They suffered from general unthriftiness and persistent foetid diarrhoea till the end. On account of the pronounced anaemia oedema of the submaxillary space, as in fascioliasis, developed. The duodenum and the intestine were found to contain haemorrhagic fluid, and the mucosa, specially of the duode- num, was markedly thickened and necrotic at places. The faeces were often found to be blood-tinged and usually contained large numbers of immature amphistomes. Recovery followed the migration of the flukes into the rumen where they attain maturity and live as practically non-pathogenic adults. The author did not carry out any therapeutic experiments. Le Roux, [1930] found that carbon tetrachloride in doses of 8 to 10 c. c. in raw linseed oil was effective in case of sheep. However, the large dose recommended by Le Roux is rather dangerous, and should be used with extreme caution. It must not be employed in the case of milking heifers. Instead, tetrachlorethy- lene and, in the case of cattle, hexachlorethane should rather be tried. The

A NOTE ON PLASMODIUM BUBALIS SHEATHER, 1919 BY M. ANANT NARAYAN RAO, G.M.V.C. Lecturer in Parasitology, Madras Veterinary College, Madras (Received for publication on 19th May 1938) (With Plate XXXV) SHEATHER [1919] discovered Plasmodium bubalis in the blood of two buffaloes used for the production of anti-rinderpest serum at the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar. Since then the parasite has been reported from there from time to time. It would appear that this protozoon affecting the buffalo has not been reported from any other province in India excepting Madras. In 1933, the organism was encountered in the blood smears received in the Parasitology section of the Madras Veterinary College from a rinderpest-stricken buffalo near Tekkali, Ganjam district. More material for study could not be had from that animal owing to its death. It was possible to obtain blood smears from other buffaloes from that village but no plasmodium could be detected. In 1936, P. bubalis was found by the Super- intendent, Madras Serum Institute in the blood smears of ten buffaloes used for anti-rinderpest serum production and one used for serum against haemorr- hagic septicaemia. All the eleven buffaloes came from near Gudur, Nellore district. The last animal developed haemoglobinuria and a rise in temperature after the first bleeding. Examination of its blood smears revealed P. bubalis. This animal was not used for further bleeding but was kept under observation to watch the natural course of an attack with the plasmodium. But for the rise in temperature and the haemoglobinuria, the animal showed no dis- comfort and the urine cleared up spontaneously on the following day. The parasites disappeared from the blood as rapidly as they appeared. It seems, therefore, that P. bubalis is a cryptic protozoon of buffaloes just as Trypano- soma theileri is of cattle, i.e., they show themselves in the presence of an in- tercurrent disease like rinderpest or when the vitality is lowered by bleeding for the production of serum. Sheather [1919] has described this plasmodium in its different stages of development in the blood excepting gametocytes, and it is proposed to give below a very brief description of the parasite with a schematic diagram of the schizogony. The plasmodium which grows in the red blood cells of the buffalo can be conveniently divided into three groups for the sake of description, viz., (a) young ring forms (Merozoites which have entered the red blood cells) (b) developing trophozoites into schizonts and (c) gametocytes. (387)
388 Plasmodium bubalis (a) YOUNG RING FORMS The majority of the young forms are ring-shaped but some appear almost like Babesia. The young forms measure 1.5 to 2µ in diameter. The nucleus is usually seen as a lump of chromatin placed at some part of the circum- ference of the ring. In some it is crescent-shaped and in a very few, a small dot of chromatin is seen near the larger nucleus. (b) DEVELOPING TROPHOZOITES The ring forms increase in size but seem to show very little amoeboid movement, when they have attained a size ranging from 2.5 to 3.5M.

Kylasam Ayyar, Superintendent, Madras Serum Institute, for kindly placing at the author's disposal the blood smears from some of the buffaloes showing the parasite.

H. D. SRIVASTAVA 393 The ovary has the shape of an inverted dome, with a notch on the t op. It measures 0.2 by 0.12 in size and lies obliquely in front of the posterior testis, between the right caecum and the median line. Laurer's canal is present. The shell gland complex lies in the median line in level with the anterior margin of the ovary. The vitellaria are composed of two, transversely elonga- ted, bipartite, lobes situated asymmetrically one on either side of the median line close in front of the ovary. The uterus is intricately coiled in the post- testicular region, but the ascending coil in front of the shell gland mass runs in a more or less straight, median course to open into the small genital atrium. The uterine coils are confined to the intercaecal space and contain a large number of eggs of 0.034 to 0.038 by 0.019 in size. The excretory bladder is of the type characteristic of the genus. In having a spatulate body with its posterior portion clearly marked off from the forebody, P. lewisi, n. sp. resembles P. spatula Odhner, 1902; P. spatulaeforme Odhner, 1902; P. patellare Sturges, 1897; P.fausti Pearse, 1924; P. superbum Stafford, 1904; P. megalorchis Nybelin, 1926; P. carolina Holl. 1929; P. simili Nybelin, 1926; P. unicum Odhner, 1902; P. staffordi Pearse, 1924; P. lacustri Lowen, 1929; P. pearsi Holl, 1929; P. angulatum Linstow, 1907; P. folium Olfers, 1816; P. americanum Osborn, 1903; P. hunteri and P. lohrenzi Lowen, 1935. In having ovary posterior to the vitellaria the new species differs from the first four species and resembles the rest. In P. americanum the testes are situated in tandem, in the median line near the posterior end. In having the uterus confined to the intercaecal space and the vitellaria composed of lobes, the new species differs from P. superbum, P. megalorchis, P. Carolina, P. simili and P. unicum and resembles the rest. It can be distinguished from the rest of the species by the shape of the body, position of the acetabulum and of gonads and by the size ratio of the suckers. P. hunteri and P. lohrenzi can be distinguished from P. lewisi by the position of the testes. P. singulare has a spatulate body with the narrow anterior portion rather sharply set off from the posterior discoidal portion, which has a noticeably crinkled margin. The new species can be distinguished from P. singulare by the relative size of the anterior and posterior parts of the body, length of the caeca, position of the vitellaria, extent of the uterus and the absence of the stylet glands.

A PRELIMINARY NOTE ON A SPECIES OF ASPERGILLUS FROM A CASE OF SKIN DISEASE IN A DOG BY S. VAITHIANATHA MUDALIAR, G.M.V.C. Assistant Lecturer, Madras Veterinary College, Madras (Received for publication on 11th March, 1938) (With Plate XXXVI.) IN the course of the routine examination of skin scrapings received from the districts, the present case was met with and an opportunity was taken to record this finding since no evidence appears to be available regarding this fungus being the cause of skin disease in dogs. SUBJECT A dog of the local breed in Devakotah of Ramnad district (S. India) aged about three years. HISTORY This dog was reported to be having a skin affection extending over six weeks, with symptoms of severe pruritus. The disease manifested itself in the form of scabs and scales over the body along with raw and bleeding patches. As a result of its restlessness, it was not feeding well and was rapidly losing- condition. DIAGNOSIS The material which consisted of crusts from the lesions was boiled in caustic soda solution and the sediment was examined under the low power of a microscope. Felted masses of mycelia were noticed and from these, a few hyphae with conidiophore bearing conidia were found protruding. Under high power, the conidiophore showed a hemispherical base measuring 8 to 20µ and from the surface of this, radiating spores or asci were seen. (Plate XXXVI, Fig. 1). These spores were either single or in twos and threes united end to end, and the single ones measured 6 to 7 µ in length. Some of them were round while others pyriform in shape. The hyphae measured 8 to 10µ. in thickness and varied in length. A very careful examination of the material did not reveal any mange mites or trichophyton. Hence, this affec- tion of the skin is believed to be due to a species of Aspergillus. (395)
396 Aspergillus from a case of Skin Disease in a Dog CULTURAL CHARACTERS The material was cultured with some difficulty in plain agar. The technique followed was to tease out from the crusts, small pieces in absolute alcohol and after a couple of changes in the alcohol, plant them in the media. In spite of these precautions, the culture became contaminated in the beginning, but in the course of about four weeks, a fairly good growth of Aspergillus, resembling the one seen in scrapings, was obtained with fructifications. It was easy to obtain sub-cultures from this growth and a luxuriant growth was obtained on Sabouraud's medium. In the course of twenty-four to thirty- six hours, a dense white cottony growth was obtained and in another twenty- four hours, the centre of the growth began to change to a light green or bluish green colour with a white border. Later, the whole mass became deep blue in colour and puckered on the surface. In a week to ten days, fructifications were plenty and the colour changed to a honey or brown tint. Examination of a small quantity of the culture in the early stages revealed a dense network of mycelia with stray hyphae and conidiophore bearing conidia. Free spores or asci were also found strewn over the area. Some of these mycelia bore endospores in varying stages of development. (Plate XXXVI, Fig. 2.) ANIMAL INOCULATION Attempts to infect laboratory small animals have been futile. Hence this species is probably non-pathogenic to these animals. Experimental transmission to dogs and other animals was not carried out due to various reasons, but it is hoped to do such transmission experiments in the near future. DISCUSSION Regarding the pathological conditions set up by the fungus Aspergillus, Buchanan [1922] mentions that the greatest number of cases have been from birds and that the lesions are generally located in the lungs, air sacs and hollow bones. In man and animals, particularly the horse, the same author records this affection in the lungs and air passages with formation of nodules not unlike tuberculosis, leading to occlusion of tubules with the fructification of the fungus and a necrosis of the tissue surrounding the organism. Castellani and Chalmers [1919] report that Aspergillus is frequently met with in man causing aspergillosis of various organs such as the lungs, eye, ear, nose, wounds and ulcers, urethra and the skin. The authors quote Montaya with regard to the several varieties of " Pinta " being caused by fungi of the Aspergillus genus. Dodge [1936] mentions a large number of species of Aspergillus affecting man, birds and other animals, but does not record any skin affection being caused by the fungus. However, he quotes Ballagi and Laubal [1933] who have shown certain species producing scabs and crusts on cutaneous inoculation in the guinea-pig. Omlin [1926] records dermatic aspergillosis
S. VAITHIANATHA MUDALIAR 397 of the horse and Rivolta and Delprato [1926] have reported dermatomycosis of pigeons caused by Aspergillus glaucus, but no record is available about the isolation of the fungus from the skin of dogs. Hence, this appears to be the first case of skin disease in a dog in which a species of Aspergillus has been isolated and believed to have caused the disease. A complete report on further work done on the subject will be published in due course. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The author is indebted to Mr. T. J. Hurley, Principal, Madras Veterinary College for his encouragement, to Rao Sahib M.

H. R. GUILBERT, R. F. MILLER and E. H. HUGHES (1937), J. of Nutrition, 13, 543. THE authors report in this article the results of their investigations on the mini- mum vitamin-A and carotene requirements of cattle, sheep and swine. Their obser- vations indicate that night blindness is the first detectable symptom of deficiency to appear on the carotene deficient ration, and the last to disappear as the amount of carotene is increased from sub-minimum to minimum levels. The night blindness test supplemented by a check on liver storage either by depletion or by the antimony trichloride test on extracts of the liver tissue was, therefore, used as a criterion of suffi- ciency. Evidence has been presented that the daily dose of vitamin-A or carotene that just prevents night blindness, represents a physiological minimum. The minimum carotene requirement for cattle, sheep and swine was found to be 25 to 30 micrograms daily per kg. body weight, an amount in agreement with similar data on the rat. The minimum vitamin-A requirement on the basis of the analysis and the criteria used by these authors, was found to be 6 to 8 micrograms daily per kg. body weight. These figures also appear to agree well with data on rats. Excellent growth occurred at these levels, but liver storage after extended periods was meagre. From the point of view of storage of vitamin-A in the liver, five to ten times the minimal intake has been found adequate. Significant storage accumulates within a few months at such a rate of in- take, but in order that the milk should be richer in vitamin-A the intake should be more liberal. The observations of these authors confirm the view that vitamin-A requirement is directly related to body weight rather than to energy requirement and that the re- quirements of other species of mammals may be predicted on this basis. Calculations from clinical data indicate that the human requirement cannot be far different from that of the other species studied. A possible limitation of this may, however, exist in the case of carnivores as they receive this factor in their diet partly as preformed vitamin- A. The authors have also pointed out that although the minimum requirement per unit of body weight is the same both for young and old animals, the former are more susceptible to pathological manifestations during vitamin-A privation. Whether or not the apparently greater resistance of older animals to pathological changes in the tissue is due to inherent differences in the tissues or to slow withdrawal of the last vestiges of reserves from adipose tissues is left open for future experimental observa- tions.

408 ABSTRACTS Carotene (or vitamin-A) deficiency and some common unsoundness in horses. EDWARDS, J. T. (J. Roy. Army Vety. Cor., 9, 1, 1 and ibid. 9, 2, 60.) THIS article, which is well illustrated, contains an excellent review of the literature on vitamin-A deficiencies in animals and the possible relationship of this deficiency and some of the common unsoundnesses, e.g., shivering, stringhalt, partial para- plegia, roaring, impaired vision and sterility in horses, as suggested by Mitchell, has been stressed. The tissue changes in animals suffering from carotene deficiency are caused by a degeneration in the body cells generally, characterised by keratinization of the epi- thelium, demyelinization in the nervous tissue, and probably loss in function of cells in other organs such as the liver, spleen and kidney. In the various species the changes are exhibited clinically by manifestations that are differently localized. Thus, for example, in the less severe forms, in the pig and the dog, the most prominent symptoms are ordinarily those of nervous incoordination, in the sheep those of urinary calculi; in the fowl and ox those of xerophthalmia. But in severe cases all symptoms may appear. Sterility is a very common sequel even in mild cases. Symptoms related to changes in the respiratory and alimentary tract are common. All the changes seen in other animals in vitamin-A deficiency arise in fowls almost simultaneously and are des- cribed under nutritional roup in fowls. The occurrence of pasty eyes in ducklings illustrates rather typically some of the effects produced upon the offspring when the diet of the mother has been deficient in vitamin-A. It is likely that some of the defects which in ignorance are spoken of as constitutional are probably as much due to the effects of prenatal nutrition as to true heredity, e.g., deficient growth of embryonic intestinal tissue in the developing chick in the absence of vitamin-B1, in the mother and the defective development of embryonic nerve tissue as a result of maternal defi- ciency of vitamin-A. There is the well-known cumulative effect of malnutrition, the effects of which in experimental animals have been found to extend to at least three or four generations. Hemeralopia or night blindness, which is an inability to see in dim light, is a com- mon early symptom of vitamin-A deficiency in some species, such as human beings, cows and sheep. Its prevalence during the war among army horses, and camels in Persia and rarely mules has been described. It was believed that it was caused through exhaustion of the sensibility of the retina by the glare of the sun. Recent studies have shown that in the absence of vitamin-A, the retina is unable to synthesize a substance called visual purple (rhodopsin) which is bleached by strong light and the absence of which causes this condition. Some cases of night blindness may probably be coupled with a slight degree of optic nerve degeneration in adult cows, a condition from which the animals recover completely after ingestion; of adequate vitamin-A. In the con- genitally blind calves, however, the degeneration of the optic nerve would have pro- gressed to a stage beyond repair. In such cases the pupils become widely dilated and a rather characteristic greenish, instead of the normal yellowish, colour is thrown from the retina on looking through the cornea with the animal facing the light or better with the help of an ophthalmoscope. Clouding of the cornea appeared in the later stages of the deficiency.
ABSTRACTS 409 Experiments were carried out upon horses in the Finnish Army which had shown rather wide-spread and typical malformations of the hoof wall that were suspected to be of dietary origin. No greens were supplied to these horses and no vitamin-A could be found in the samples of hay that was fed to them. A marked improvement, in de- creasing order of effectiveness, was brought about by supplementary grazing, A. I. V. silage (acidity below pH4), and cod-liver oil and a vigorous growth of healthy horn started from the coronary band. With the exception of yellow maize, cereals are deficient in carotene or vitamin-A. Certain cereals, such as oats, were particularly liable to ' sop up ' vitamin-A in the body and cause symptoms to appear. These symptoms were intensified by the addition of ergot to the cereal diet but could be prevented by including in it adequate carotene or vitamin-A. On extending this work to lathyrism in dogs it was observed that the neurotoxin of Akta became effective in the absence of vitamin-A and carotene. Symp- toms of poisoning caused by cotton seed meal and certain other similar meals410 ABSTRACTS A herbivorous animal under natural conditions should carry a reserve in the liver of not less than 1,000 " blue units " or " Moore's units " per grm. In seventy-eight horses examined it was found that the livers of 37 per cent contained less than 100 B. U. per grm.ABSTRACTS 411 This was due to Christian insistence upon the importance of the soul, an attribute not vouchsafed to animals. When even the human body might be tortured for the good of the soul, it is not surprising that we find them regarding the succouring of animals a sacrilege against the divine art of medicine. In the middle ages, even in the liberal University of Salerno, where the masters dissected animals in the absence of human bodies, the study of animal diseases was regarded as heretical and men were condemned for undertaking it. Meanwhile, however, in the East, where philosophy dealt only with life and its mysteries, men and animals were deemed to have an identical destiny and consequently human and animal medicine were held in equal honour. Hence, veterinary science, dead among the Christians, continued to develop in the orient, particularly among the Arabs. When the Arabs conquered large parts of Europe, they profoundly influenced the then prevailing attitude towards animals and retaught Europe much of the Greek veterinary knowledge that it had forgotten, together with several new additions. This marked the veterinary Renaissance, but the movement had little influence until the eighteenth century when the ' philosophers of nature ' sought a basis for their systems in the study of anatomy and physiology. Even then the new attitude did not penetrate to the main body of public opinion, and Frederick the Great encountered insuperable opposition when he attempted to open a veterinary school in Berlin, while, when opening the Dresden school, the Duke of Courland was obliged to handle the carcases himself to overcome the repugnance of the assistants, and the King of England had to issue edicts for the protection of veterinary students, obliged to touch dead animals in the course of their studies, against popular prejudice. A century, however, of hard work sufficed to free the veterinary art from its earlier obloquy and to allow it to take its place in science and society. ANTIQUITY Primitive man was a hunter, at first on equal terms with the hunted, but, when, after thousands of years, he discovered how to polish flints for weapons, he secured dominion over the animal world. Thereafter, men living in tribes, were able to settle where they would and cultivate the earth and domesticate animals for food and tillage. Although we know nothing of animal medicine at this date, it is reasonable to sup- pose that on the more valuable animals, primitive surgery, such as that practised on man, was used, but in the dawn of mankind, as they have continued to do almost up to our own time, practice and superstition went hand in hand and magic dominated medicine. In Neolithic times, while Europe was still emerging from the grip of the Ice Age, India was abundantly peopled, owing to its temperate climate and the fertility of the land. The advanced Indus valley civilization, discovered by Sir John Marshall at Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, has been proved prior to that of Sumer. There is evi- dence of the use of the bull, sheep, camel, ox and fowl in this period but the horse ap- pears to have been unknown. When the conquering Aryans wiped out this civiliza- tion, its culture passed by way of the conquerors to Persia, Greece and Rome.
412 ABSTRACTS The Sumerian civilization left behind it documentary evidence of medical practice, proving that these peoples considered blood, replenished by food, as the life force and the liver the centre of the body (viz. the use of animal livers' for fortune telling). Water and fire, mixed with religious ritual, were their main therapeutics. Domestic animals constituted the chief criterion of wealth and in them taxes were paid. Horses were uncommon but occasionally used to draw war-chariots. In the Babylonish civilization again, pastoral life was of predominating importance and we find shepherds figuring in the kings' entourage. Men were taxed according to the number of animals they owned and animals were protected by law, theft of cattle being severely punished, while the sale, hire and pasturing of animals was regulated. Under these circumstances, we expect and find that veterinary knowledge was con- sidered of great importance, but it was still inextricable from human medicine and still mainly theological, only external wounds and disease, such as fractures and diseases of the eye being treated, while most diseases, considered as divine visitations, were relegated to the care of the priest. From, 1900 B.C.ABSTRACTS 413 and strict rules of hygiene were practised. Palakapya's ' Hastyaurveda ' dealt with the diseases, treatment and surgery of elephants. Calihotra of Kandahar wrote in Persian on the diseases of elephants and horses. The Asvavaidyaka deals with the ana- tomy and exterior maladies of horses, and mentions bleeding, blistering and cauteri- zation, as well as the telling of an animal's age by its teeth. In 1838, Mills, the Prin- cipal of the Bombay college, discovered a very old medical treatise in Tamil, the work of a ' Rishi' on cattle. This work shows that even in that far-off era, bovine diseases were classified and treated. They undoubtedly knew rinderpest, anthrax, staggers, dysentery, piroplasmosis, meningo-encephalitis and ague. Their treatments recall Arab medicine and doubtless came from a common source. The medicines are less scientific, prescriptions including ground bones, female milk, urine, cattle excreta and feathers. The history of veterinary medicine in Greek and Roman times is dealt with at length by Léclainche but cannot be more than glanced at in this abstract. The Greeks were the real founders of veterinary medicine. The Age of Hippocrates was perhaps the most brilliant in veterinary history and has certainly influenced veterinary practice in all succeeding centuries. The Greek veterinarians were neither philosophers nor thinkers but attentive and conscientious observers. Most of them also practised as doctors and their methods are similar to those used for man. The Romans merely collected and annotated the work of the Greeks. They were compilers and dissertators. They established their classifications from books and not from actual observation and it is useless to attempt to identify the diseases they des- cribe. Their work was more complicated and far less rational than that of the Greeks. The Byzantine successors of the Romans merely stored the Greek and Roman literature during the Dark Ages of Europe and made further compilations. Rome imposed her civilization so heavily on large parts of Europe that all countries outside her jurisdiction were held to be ' barbarians ' but it is untrue to regard all these peoples as savages. The Druids in Britain had a high standard of education and a cer- tain medical knowledge. Rome imported her war dogs from them. Gaul, too, before Caesar's conquest, had a splendid cavalry, a well-developed agricultural system and intelligent methods of cattle breeding. It produced fine wool from selected flocks and exported the best meat in Europe. Plagues and contagious diseases of antiquity.414 ABSTRACTS For twenty centuries a plague of extreme gravity, recurring at intervals, appeared in the Eastern Mediterranean and spread westwards. It is heard of in mythology and legend, but first definitely described in the Bible (Exodus. Chap. IX) along with many other scourges meted out by Jehovah to the Egyptians to punish them for en- slaving the Israelites. It is here described as being characterized by the appearance of ulcers and was responsible for the deaths of enormous numbers of men and animals. Similar plagues are described :ABSTRACTS 415 is violent pains, rolling on the ground, groaning, sweating and sudden collapse. Dis- tension of the stomach by gas is given the picturesque name of " the drum ". Intes- tinal invagination, volvulus, serious diarrhoeas, dropsy and tympanites are also clearly described. They were treated with douches, scarifications and punctures to allow the introduction of a reed to withdraw fluid. Liver complaints received extensive study but those described are difficult to identify and may be peculiar to certain regions, due to microbic or parasitical invasions or chronic toxaemia from poisonous plants. Infections of the respiratory tracts are only studied in their outward manifestations. Polypus of the nose is declared frequent in horses and treated by excision or cauteri- zation. The description of pneumonia is confused and often clearly includes glanders. It was treated with fumigations, purgatives, bleeding and strange and complex me- dicines. Only those urinary troubles easy to investigate were studied. They differentiated between dysuria, strangury and ischuria. The treatments were numerous and not very effective, for example massage of the loins or of the full bladder through the rectum, or the introduction of irritating substances such as salt into the urethra. Affections of the central nervous system were studied only in their manifestations, such as the phenomena of excitability, frenzy, epilepsy, contraction, tetanus and para- lysis. Tetanus was confounded with exposure, a state frequent in army horses during mountain passages in winter. It was treated by hot baths and bleeding. One form of paraplegia, described as characterised by staggering and the emission of thick, black urine, evidently corresponds with enzootic haemoglobinuria. Paralysis of the penis, inguinal hernia frequent in old horses and vaginal-uterine prolapse are all described and their treatment detailed. Diseases of the eyes are often mentioned and appear to have been very frequent in Asia and Africa, particularly endemic ophthalmia, conjunctivitis, ulcers of the cornea and staphyloma. They operated upon cataract. Dislocations, fractures and bruises were minutely studied but major fractures were regarded as incurable. A considerable amount was known regarding ligamentary and tendinous lesions but little of articular arthritis and "founder". Deep hoof wounds were cut and cauterized but superficial ones were left to the care of the owner, who cleaned them with copper sulphate. These were very common, as among the Greeks shoeing was unknown and among the Romans, metal shoes often of silver or gold, tied by bandages to the hoof, were mainly used only for show. The ancients relied chiefly on keeping the stable floors, made preferably of wood, dry and clean, to avoid serious foot troubles. Diseases of cattle.416 ABSTRACTS preceded his time, and it includes texts on the pathological conditions of ruminants and pigs. It is clear that at this date cattle were considered mainly from their import- ance in agriculture and economics ; but Magnon quotes Democrates as saying, " the causes of nearly all diseases of cattle are unknown ". Careful rules of hygiene were observed but treatments were mostly unscientific, such as treating hoof trouble with fermented urine. Powdered snake skin was much used in prescriptions. The principal causes of disease were held to be excesses of heat, cold or labour. Fowl and pig excreta were considered very dangerous. A few para- sitical invasions were recognised, particularly fluke disease, which caused enormous losses in herds during wet years. External diseases are more adequately dealt with, but more summarily than in horses. Dislocations due to methods of stabling were frequent. Practice of veterinary medicine in antiquity.ABSTRACTS 417 Not until the time of the Crusades do we find any amelioration of this condition. When the Crusaders' horses were decimated by glanders and the crusading army spread all kinds of disease in their wake, they were forced to take some measures for the protection of their animals but these consisted mostly of the administration of drugs and petty surgery and the theory was confined to camp-fire discussions. Nothing was written at the time and much of the practice must have been illogical and barbaric ; though the social position of the veterinarian was undoubtedly improved, when even the nobility deigned to interest themselves in and acquire some knowledge of veterinary practice. Not, however, till the time of the Arab invasions of Europe, was there any real return of scientific knowledge to Europe. The Arabs exercised a profound and bene- ficial influence on medicine, not only because of their very real love for and interest in their horses, but because they rediscovered the old Greek knowledge in Byzantium and returned it to Europe. Islam was for many centuries the home of civilization. The Abassid Caliphs were patrons of science and art, and encouraged the study of Greek, Syrian, Hindu and Persian texts. There were also original writers, the two greatest probably being Abouzacaria and Abour-Bekr, whose book is, even to-day, described as a ' monument to the glory of the horse'. Another writer, the much discussed 'Ippocras the Hindu ' a native of Sind, was attached to the court of Chosroes the Great of Persia. Apart, however, from returning the ancient learning to Europe and adding a little to the knowledge of horse breeding and surgery and enriching pharmacy, they added little to the sum of knowledge and nothing at all to that regarding cattle medicine. Plagues and contagions in the Middle Ages.418 ABSTRACTS In 1275, sheep pox was imported into England from France and the magnificient flocks bred by the Cistercian monks were for twenty-eight years decimated or completely destroyed in all parts of the kingdom, while England's woollen trade was seriously affected. In 1301 and 1313, equine influenza had serious hold in Rome. During 1345-50 owing to the Black death (small pox) men, horses, cattle, sheep and goats died in millions.

IN this article the author has brought forward further evidence in support of his previous publication [Jocono, 1935. Annali di Med. Nav. e Coloniale, i, fasc. 1-11 ] in which it was proposed that the genus Trypanosoma should, provisionally, be repre- sented by Trypanosoma rotatorium of frog, while the other haemoflagellates of man and animal should be regrouped under the genus Castellanella. Development of T. rota- torium has been observed in vitro and a new medium has been suggested which consists of the following ingredients:420 ABSTRACTS Nine years' clinical experience of the Laidlaw-Dunkin method of immunisation against Canine Distemper.
