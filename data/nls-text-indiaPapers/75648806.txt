Below Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, for the year 1943-44. No. 8712/G.-IV-3 of 1944-45. OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF VETERINARY SERVICES, SIND. Karachi, dated 14th October 1944. Forwarded with compliments to the Secretary to the Government of Sind, General Department, Karachi. 2. Mr. Bachan Singh, M.R.C.V.S., J.P., held charge of the Department throughout the year. 3. The mortality from Contagious, Infectious and Parasitic diseases was 4,188 as against 7,377 in the preceding year. The large decrease in the mortality was in fact due to the absence of Rinderpest in the Province, and moreover, on the whole, the year remained healthy for Live-Stock as compared to the previous year. 4. One Itinerating and one stationary Veterinary Dispensaries were opened during the year, thus bringing the total strength to 37 as against 35 dispensaries working during the last year. The programme initiated by the department for opening 8 Itinerating Veterinary Dispensaries has been completed during the year under report. There has been demands from different Local Boards for opening of more Veterinary Dispensaries, but owing to dearth of qualified hands, a number of vacancies of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons remained unfilled and further expansion of the department was hampered. In these institutions 50,106 cases were treated as compared with 47,499 last year, 6,593 castrations were performed as against 5,517 performed last year. 5. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and Veterinary Field Compounders during the course of their tours treated 56,294 cases for contagious and parasitic diseases, 9,259 cases for non-contagious diseases and casterated 4,522 animals in 3,567 villages during the year under report as against 69,454 cases for contagious and parasitic diseases, 7,918 for non-contagious diseases treated and 3,318 castrations performed in 2,831 villages during the preceding year. From the above it would appear that there has been an appreciable increase all round in the activities of the department in spite of large number of vacancies of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons which remained unfilled. 6. The Department was called upon to participate in different Shows, War rallies and Exhibitions, etc., but on account of lack of funds for pro- paganda work it had found itself in a most awkward position but, however, with greatest difficulty it had managed to organise stalls and acquitted itself favourably along with other sister departments. Unfortunately for the last two years my proposal for a sum of Rs. 1,000 essentially required for pro- paganda was rejected by Government which has been repeated in the next budget estimates and deserves favourable consideration.

The final sanction regarding the appointment of Assistant Veterinary Investigation Officer, for Poultry diseases in Sind on 50 : 50 basis by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, is being awaited. 8. The District Local Board, Upper Sind Frontier, held their Horse and Pony Show at Jacobabad as usual and Department rendered every possible help in judging horses and cattle at the Show. Government contributed Rs. 500 and a silver medal was awarded to the best animal at the Show. The Karachi Race and Riding Club, Limited, through their generosity also con- tributed Rs. 500 in cash. 9. The total expenditure of the department during the year was Rs. 1,90,491 as against Rs. 1,83,262. BACHAN SINGH, Director of Veterinary Services, Sind.

Mirza from 1st April to 25th November 1943. He was deputed to Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar and Izatnagar, for receiving Laboratory training for a period of about two months and relinquished the charge of his office on the 26th November 1943 to Mr. J. R. Banna, Veterinary Inspector, Upper Sind Circle, who held the charge of the post in addition to his own duties until 28th February 1944, as on completion of training by Mr. M. W. Mirza he proceeded on Medical grounds from 21st January 1944 and was on leave on 31st March 1944. Mr. Mirza's lien was shifted as Veterinary Inspector, Upper Sind Circle, and Mr. J. R. Banna was appointed Veterinary Inspector, Lower Sind Circle, from 29th February 1944 which post he held on 31st March 1944 in addition to his own duties. The post of Veterinary Inspector, Upper Sind Circle, was held by Mr. J. R. Banna from 1st April 1943 to 28th February 1944 and held the charge of Lower Sind Circle, in addition to his own duties for the period Mr. M. W. Mirza was on deputation for training and subsequently on leave that is to say that Mr. Banna held charge of the two circles from 26th November 1943 to 31st March 1944. 52. Mr. M. W. Mirza was on tour for 156 days covering 3,929 miles by rail, 323 miles by road, visiting 51 villages. Mr. J. R. Banna toured for 190 days visited 105 villages and travelled 3,374 miles by rail and 564 miles by road. Both the Veterinary Inspectors performed very useful work during the year in periodically inspecting the Veterinary Dispensaries and in super- vising the field work of Subordinates in villages. 53. There were 8 Veterinary Field Compounders working in the depart- ment. Of these, one was deputed to the Sind Police Rifles and the remainder were placed in-charge of Itinerating Veterinary Dispensaries. They, as usual, attended to minor ailments of animals such as Liver Fluke Disease, Parasitic gastritis, Foot-and-Mouth disease, Mange, etc., and carried out castration of bulls by Burdizzo method. They have been of immense help to Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in supplementing their work in the district and their utility having been realised as cheap and useful agency, Government have been pleased to increase this cadre by 8 more Veterinary Field Compounders to be filled in the year 1944-45. 54. The Clerical Staff performed their duties very efficiently in spite of a great difficulty experienced in filling the vacancy of junior clerk owing to paucity of hands available with corresponding tremendous increase in the office work due to the expansion of the department. Besides, on account of sudden death of Mr. J. L. Anjaria one of the most senior hands who was Head Clerk in December 1943, Mr. Sulleman I. Mahomedi the present Head Clerk had to shoulder the responsibilities with the help of two other junior clerks Messrs. Kishinchand D. Kirpalani and Premchand C. Ramnaney who in spite of great pressure of work discharged their duties in a most conscientious manner. Proposals for the expansion of the clerical staff in the department which has recently been met by Government by the appointment of a few temporary hands are not at all adequate to solve this important problem and revised proposals will be submitted in due course.
