No. 14T. From SURGEON-COLONEL A. STEPHEN, M.B., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF ASSAM. Dated Camp Dibrugarh, the \st February 1896. I Sir, I HAVE the honour to submit the Annual Report and Returns of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1895, together with a copy of my remarks on the Asylum, made after I inspected the institution on the 25th July 1895. In the remarks the different points on which action is required are noted. The mortality among the inmates during 1895 was comparatively small, only ~ 6*59 per cent., as compared with 26*44, the death-rate in 1894, and 11*63 per cent., the average death-rate of the previous ten years. The Overseer of the Asylum was replaced on the 4th of October by a Hospital Assistant, who performs the duties of Subordinate Medical Officer in addition to those of Overseer, and I agree with the Superintendent that the change is likely to result in much advantage to the Asylum as regards the care shown to the sick. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, A. STEPHEN, M.B., Surgeon-Colonel, Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam.

Copy of INSPECTION REMARKS made by Surgeon-Colonel A. STEPHEN, M.B., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assa?n, Oft the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum^ dated the 25th July 1895. I VISITED the Lunatic Asylum this morning, accompanied by the Superintendent, Surgeon-Major Macnamara. There are at present 113 inmates, of whom 93 are males and 20 are females. Of the males, 21 are criminal lunatics, and one of the females is a criminal. The Asylum enclosure was very clean and tidy, and the drainage arrangements seemed to be efficient. The sleeping barracks and the recreation and work-sheds were in good order. The floors of some of the barracks were covered with sand, which was for the most part fairly dry. This sand should be changed at least once a week, and when opportunity offers, the sand in stock should be exposed to the sun's rays. The floor of one line of barracks was bare, and a portion of it was distinctly damp. The floor of this barrack should also be covered with sand. If these barracks had verandahs on both sides, the walls would be better protected from rains, and the rooms would not be so damp as they are at present. The floor of the criminal barrack was covered with well-sifted earth, which was for the most part fairly dry. There was not the slightest unpleasant odour in this or in any of the other barracks when I visited them. Six of the male lunatics were engaged in mat-making under shelter. An effort should be made to give as many of the quiet lunatics as possible some kind of light work in the work-shed. Several of the inmates were weak and anaemic, but most of them seemed to be in a fairly good state of health. There were three male lunatics in hospital, one suffering from chronic bronchitis, one from anaemia and one from dyspepsia. The hospital was clean, and was in good order. The hospital latrine floor was covered with sand, and there was no unpleasant odour. Only three of the inmates have died this year up to date, one from dysentery and two from anaemia ; nine deaths occurred in the Asylum last year up to the same date ; the average population was nearly the same in both years, so that the rate of mortality this year up to date has been only one-third of last year's mortality during the corresponding period. The blankets in use were of good quality, and were in a good state of repair. A considerable number of the inmates were not wearing coats, garments which they frequently tear up and throw away. An effort should be made to compel all the inmates to wear coats during the rainy season. The inmates in a delicate state of health are given a dish of tea at 8 o'clock in the morning. The morning meal is at present served between 9 and 10 o'clock, and the lunatics get their evening meal at 5 p.m. The rice, dhal, and vegetables which I saw Were of good quality, and seemed to be well cooked. I understand that the female lunatics have been in the habit of getting their meals in the male enclosure. The female warders should unde^ be directed to carry the meals of the female lunatics into cook-house for their food, but they the female enclosure from the cook-house. Female lunatics e&laquo;&lt; it in their own quarters. I ^jnk the Principal Medical Officer should never be allowed to go into the male enclosure, and Misunderstood me when I said the 1111 in i , i r t females come for their food to the males should never be allowed to go into the female portions cook.house. ^ ^ 0f f-^g Asylum, and the door between the male and female enclosures should be kept closed and locked. -*
2 The wall of the small masonry tank attached to the Asylum well is cracked, and the tank is at present useless. It should be put into a proper state of repair as soon as practicable. There are very few vegetables under cultivation in the garden at present; there are a good many pumpkins in stock in the godown. The floors of the latrines were covered with sand instead of earth, as it is difficult to keep a sufficient supply of dry earth during the rains. The trenching system was in force. The trenches should be only one foot wide and one foot deep. The Asylum establishment consists of an overseer, a jemadar, 9 male and 2 female warders. There is also a compounder attached to the hospital, and the Hospital Assistant in subordinate charge of the charitable dispensary visits the Asylum daily. The Chief Commissioner has decided to put a second-class Hospital Assistant in subordinate charge of the Asylum, instead of the overseer, from the ist of October. He will perform the duties of overseer, and will at the same time act as resident medical assistant. I Lunat 1 1

I have the honour to forward herewith the Annual Report and Returns of the Tezpur Lunatic Ayslum for the year 1895. The report has been delayed for the following reason : The certificate of cash drawn from, and remitted to, the Tezpur treasury during 1895 has only just been furnished by the treasury officer, though he had been requested in this office letter No. 1, dated the 2nd January 1896, to supply it early.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 18g5. 1. Asylum charge.I was in charge of the Asylum as Superintendent during the entire year. 2. Improvemnts.{a) There were no alterations made in the asylum buildings during the year, but they were all kept in thorough repair. The masonry cistern with filtering compartment attached put up by the Public Works Department last year sank at one end owing to a faulty foundation, and had to be entirely rebuilt. (/;) The bamboo palisade surrounding the Asylum was renewed in places, the upper ends of the bamboos, which formerly were pointed, being now cut with blunt ends, as suggested by the Surgeon-General with the Government of India, when he visited the Asylum in December 1893. (c) The use of dry earth in the criminal ward has been continued with marked benefit. The old plan of washing the floor of this ward has been given up, because, when washed in the morning, it was often not quite dry at night. (a) In the non-criminal sleeping wards we use sand spread over the floors. It, was tried as an experiment instead of dry earth, and answers well, but the female wards are still leeped. They look much cleaner when leeped. 3. Accommodation.The Asylum contains accommodation for 80 male and 38 female patients. The greatest numbers confined in any one day were 93 males and 12 females, but overcrowding was prevented by the use of the hospital. The sleeping wards are occupied only at night, and are freely ventilated through the walls. 4. Clothing and bedding.The summer clothing was, as usual, made by prisoners in the Tezpurjail, and Bhagalpur Jail blankets were used at night, and for making blanket coovtas. The Asylum grant for clothing is only Rs. 800 ; this year we have spent over Rs. 1,000 on clothing. One patient, a discharged sepoy, was very destructive to clothing, and it frequently happens that when patients are sent out to work, they leave portions of their clothing behind them. We use rough mattresses and pillows stuffed with straw instead of tat bedding, but for sanitary reasons we shall probably have to return to tat bedding in the hot season. Our annual supply of blankets,.indented for in July, has not yet been received from Bhagalpur, but is expected daily. 5. Drainage.The drainage of the Asylum is excellent, and no improvement is contemplated. 6. Hospital accommodation. No change. The hospital wards arc no better than the ordinary sleeping wards, and for practical purposes the entire institution is a hospital. The hospital proper is used for cases which would be objectionable in the ordinary wards. At present with 89 male patients, the hospital is used as an overflow ward. 7. Water-supply.No alteration in the supply, which is good and abundant. A light chain would be better for drawing up the bucket than a rope, which has to be replaced frequently ; but I am in hopes that we shall some day get a continuous chain and bucket pump on the dredger principle. These pumps, which cost about Rs. 300, are in use on some of the tea gardens in the district, and have no complicated parts. Rope for the well costs us Rs. 2 every month on an average. 8. Conservancy.No change. The dry-earth system works well. We have only one paid sweeper.

The mortality of the Asylum has fallen considerably. There were 7 deaths, against 28 in the year 1894. No patients were sent from the Asylum to the dispensary. Details of the 7 deaths which took place during the year are here given : (1) Dysentery.Jhalmal Koch, criminal, aged 30 years, received in indifferent health on 30th July 1894, and died on 22nd January, after being five months and 22 days in the Asylum. He killed his daughter, and was suffering from melancholia. He refused his food, and his strength was kept up with a considerable amount of trouble until he got dysentery. Ulceration of the large intestine with dropsical effusion found post mortem. (2) Ancemia.Musammat Pelang, aged 20 years. Was received in a very bad state of health, being an anaemic garden coolie, who was brought up for admission before the committee of 30th November 1S94, when the Deputy Commissioner, who presided, made the following note : Admitted a woman named Pelang in very bad health, a good illustration of the cases sent to the Asylum. She died on the 27th January from extreme anaemia with dropsical effusion into the serous cavities, and general anasarca verified post mortem. (3) Ancemia,Musammat Sarfee.This case resembled the last in all essential particulars on admission. She was given to uncontrollable fits of grief and weeping. Came to the Asylum on 1st December 1S94, and died on 12th March 1895. Aged 20 years. (4) Pneumonia.Biraspoti was nearly 20 years in the Asylum, having been admitted on 25th May 1876, in good health, on transfer from the Dacca Lunatic Asylum. He enjoyed good health until 6th July 1895, and died on 16th of August. Aged 50 years. His left lung was found hepatized post mortem.
i (5) Anamia.Hahiram, aged 18 years. Received in indifferent health on 3rd August 1894, suffering from acute mania. His health in the Asylum was never good. He went naked, refused food, and died, on 14th of September 1895, of anaemia with the usual post mortem appearances. (6) Ancumia.Badal, aged 36 years, was an idiot ; received in indifferent health on 8th July 1894. He made no progress towards recovery either mentally or bodily, and died, on 20th September 1895, of anaemia with the usual appearances. (7) Tetanus.Kashinath Nepali, aged 50 years. Admitted into the Asylum on 9th September 1894. Died of tetanus (believed to be traumatic, as he had a slight wound on his head) on 9th December 1895. Health good on admission. I think it may fairly be said that the Asylum was healthy during the year, for only two of the patients who died were received in good health, and one of these died of tetanus and the other of pneumonia. The year was a very unhealthy one in the Darrang district. The Asylum mortality was only one-fourth of what it had been in the preceding year. I have compared the percentage of mortality on the total population (4*86) and the percentage of mortality on the daily average strength (6&quot; 59) with the results obtained in the former years in other asylums, and find the results in favour of Tezpur as far as the year 1895 is concerned. Two noteworthy events took place during the year : The first, a proposal to amalgamate asylums made by the late Surgeon-General with the Government of India, with a view to more skilful treatment of the insane with diminution of expenditure, was made in February. As the scheme, if carried out, involved the abolition of this Aslyum, it was considered unwise to make any recommendations involving either substantial changes to buildings or outlay of any kind in connection with them. The second was the appointment of a qualified Hospital Assistant, chosen from the Subordinate Medical Department, as overseer and subordinate medical officer to the Asylum, instead of the former non-qualified overseer. The change took place on 4th October, and is likely to result in much advantage to the Asylum as regards the care of the sick. The Asylum garden supplies an abundance of vegetables. 21.

At the beginning of 1895 we na&lt;^ !4&deg; niaunds and 25 seers of nee in stock, which was paid for in 1894 ; we now, at the beginning cf 1896, have 300 m.iunds of rice in stock, which we paid for in 1895. We owe for blankets Rs. 749-12-0, for which we received a bill from the Bhagalpuf Jail in November, but which we have not shown under &quot;Clothing,&quot; as we have not yet got the blankets. ((/) Hospital Assistant Girish Chandra Das, who took charge of the Asylum as overseer and subordinate medical officer on 4th October, has so far done well. Three warders were dismissed during the year for neglect of duty. The jemadar nad to be changed twice. One man was compelled to resign, and his successor was dismissed for threatening to damage Asylum property.
8 (e) The Asylum was visited twice during the year by the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner of Assam. Eleven meetings of the Committee of Visitors were held, and copies of their proceedings were forwarded to the Chief Commissioner of Assam through the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam. 26. Attention was directed in the Resolution on the Asylum Report for last year to the employment of the lunatics. I would, therefore, note here that the lunatics, in respect to work, fall naturally into three classes: first, those, such as confirmed epileptics or patients suffering from paralysis or other physical disabilities, who are unfit and unable to work ; of such cases we have at present about 8 in the Asylum; second, those who, though physically fit, are unwilling and refuse to work, of whom there are 6 in the Asylum ; and, third, those who are both able and willing to do more or less work. Our hours of labour are, for the general body of the lunatics in the cold season, out of doors, from 7 to 9 a. m. and from 2 to 4 p. m., but in the hot season these periods are pushed further apart so as to secure a larger rest during the hot part of the day, when the patients are kept under shelter. As we have only one paid menial servant, all the work of cooking, wood-cutting, sweeping, carting, water-carrying, clothes-washing, repairs of buildings, pounding dry earth, cow-herding and gardening is done by the lunatics. It must not, however, be understood that we have done nothing to provide employment under cover, especially for male lunatics, as we have started carpentry, basket and mat-making on a small scale under cover. The patients who work at these latter occupations are not limited to the stated hours. With regard to the female lunatics, they have hitherto been largely employed in garden work, by themselves, and apart from the males, guarded by a female keeper, but we have recently started weaving (two looms), and make sharis and dhutis. The outturn, however, so far has been small, as only 3 female patients seem to have any experience of this work. We intend now trying thread-making and the manufacture of newar; 3 females clean rice and dal, and 4 are employed cleaning up the female compounds and female wards. Most of the female lunatics are garden coolies, who are accustomed to do little but garden work. All the labour used in thatching and repairs to the buildings and enclosure is done by the male lunatics. Progress in the direction suggested in paragraph 3 of Government of India letter No. 23Medl.785, dated Simla, the 26th October 1895, is necessarily slow, as there are few manufactures where either knives or ropes are not required, and these can scarcely be regarded as safe. I think I have said enough to show that the wishes of Government have not been lost sight of, but I still think there is much room for improvement in this direction. I find that the sum of Rs. 974-13-6 was the earnings of the patients during the year as represented by the sum paid into the treasury (Rs. 218-1-0) in cash plus the amount of produce made over to the Asylum for the use of the lunatics (Rs. 756-12-6), and I am aware that the question of working at a profit is a secondary consideration. It will be seen from the above remarks that only a small proportion of the lunatics are employed under shelter, but that no work is done out of doors in the heat of the day.

Resolution on the Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1895. Extract from the Proceedings ofth Chief Commissioner of Assam, in the Judicial Branch, No. 1262 J.t dated Shillong, the \\th April 1896. Read Letter No. 14T., dated the 1st February 1896, from the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam, forwarding the Annual Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1895. RESOLUTION. There were 105 inmates, 83 males and 22 females, in the asylum at the beginning of the year. Thirty-seven new patients were admitted in 1895, of whom 5 were females; two old patients were re-admitted during the year. Twenty-six inmates, 23 males and 3 females, were discharged, of whom 21 were cured ; the remaining 5, whose mental condition had improved during their detention, were made over to their friends. There were 7 deaths and no escapes, against 28 deaths and 3 escapes in 1894. The number of inmates in the asylum at the close of the year was 111 8y males and 22 females, and of the total number, 22 males and 1 female were criminal lunatics. The daily average number in the asylum during the year was 106, the same as in the previous year. Of the inmates remaining at the end of the year, 52 were natives of the province and 59 belonged to the immigrant classes. 2. A prominent feature of the report is the small death-rate; the percentage of deaths to average strength was 6*59, against 26*44 in x^94 ana^ ai1 average of 11*63 for the previous ten years. The improvement in this respect may perhaps be partly attributed to the remedial measures which were introduced consequent on the special enquiry made last year into the causes of mortality in the asylum {vide paragraph 2 of the Resolution on the Report for 1894). The appointment of a Hospital Assistant in place of a non-qualified overseer has probably also contributed to the better results, as this officer combines the duties of overseer and medical attendant. Discipline was maintained, and there were no escapes. The reduction in the cost of maintenance per head of average strength is deserving of notice, the cost having fallen from Rs. 96-13-2 per lunatic in 1894 to Rs. 93-8-3 in 1895. The Chief Commissioner is glad to learn from the last paragraph of the report that efforts were made to provide employment for the lunatics under shelter. The Superintendent has pointed out the difficulty of so employing lunatics without putting dangerous implements into their hands, but the Chief Commissioner trusts that the matter will continue to receive his attention. 3. The asylum was inspected by the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner on the 25th July 1895, and the result of his inspection is recorded in a note which has been printed with the report. The Surgeon-General with the Government of India also visited the asylum shortly after the close of the year, and recorded his opinion that the inmates were in good physical health, and appeared to be well nourished. 4. Surgeon-Major Macnamara was Superintendent of the asylum throughout the year, and the Chief Commissioner is well satisfied with the manner in which he discharged his duties. By order of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, E. A. GAIT, Ojfg% Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam. A. S. P. O. (Judl.)-No 1120 15.4-96.

No. 370C. From Surgeon-Colonel A. STEPHEN, M.B., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF ASSAM. Dated the 4th February 1897 Sir, I HAVE the honour to forward the Annual Report and Returns of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1896. I also beg to enclose a copy of the remarks entered by me in the Asylum Visitor's Book, when I inspected the institution on the 3rd of March 1896. The different points on which, in my opinion, action is required are noted in these remarks. 2. Seven of the inmates died during the year, the death-rate having been 6*oi per cent, of the average strength. In 1895, the death-rate was 6'$g per cent, and in 1894 ^ was 26*44 per cent., and the average death-rate for the ten years 188493 was ji 1*63 per cent. 3. I do not approve of the proposal of the Superintendent to return to the method of leeping the floors of the barracks. The floors are damp during the rainy months, and the method of leeping would render them damper than they would otherwise be. !When discharges are voided on the floor, the sand should at once be removed from that portion of the floor, and fresh dry sand should be laid down. 4. The Superintendent states in his report that he did not make use of the prophylactic method of treatment recommended by the Surgeon-General with the Government of India in his Note on the Annual Reports on Lunatic Asylums for the year 1894. The Superintendent ought to have carried out this treatment during the ^unhealthy months of 1896, as a copy of the Note above referred to was sent to him for information and guidance, under cover of this office memorandum No. 2449C, dated |the 12th December 1895. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, A. STEPHEN, M.B.t Surgeon-Colonel, Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam.

Copy of INSPECTION REMARKS made by the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, on the lezpur Lunatic Asylum, under date the 3rd March 1896. I inspegted the Lunatic Asylum this morping apcompanjed by the Superintendent, Surgeon-Major Macnamara. The compound was extremely neat and tidy and the surface drains appeared to be in good order. The hospital was undergoing annual repairs; the other buildings have not as yet been repaired. The work should be carried through as soon as practicable ; and care should be taken to render the roofs thoroughly watertight. Most of the sleeping barrack floors were covered with sand. These floors were, as was to be expected, dry, as little or no rain has fallen for several months. During the rains every effort should be made to keep up a good stock of dry sand, and the sand on the floors should, during and for some time after the rains, be changed at least once a week. In the rainy season the barrack walls on the sides on which there are no verandahs must become wet when the wind happens to blow towards the unprotected sides. I again recommend that both sides of the barracks be provided with verandahs in order to keep the walls dry. The floors of the criminal wards were covered with properly sifted earth, which was iquite dry. These wards smelt distinctly close; in order to still further improve their ventilation, openings should be made at the eaves on both sides of the wards. If these are made, good lateral ventilation will be obtained. The bedding was of good quality and was ample in quantity. Each inmate is provided with two new and one old blanket. About 25 of the male inmates were in possession of blanket coats and 40 of them have ccats made of dosuti, the rest of the male lunatics did not have coats. Means should be taken to provide all the inmates [with dosuti coats as soon as practicable, and arrangements should be made for having a full supply of blanket coats ready before the beginning of next cold weather. The raw articles of food were of good quality and the morning meal, which was eaten in my presence, was very well cooked. The food of the female lunatics is carried by the female warders from the cook-house into the female enclosure, and female lunatics are never allowed to enter the male enclosure. The door between the two enclosures is kept locked and the key remains in the possession of the Hospital Assistant. The filter with attached tank beside the well has been repaired, but it cannot be used because proper taps have not been provided. The filter should be brought into use as soon as practicable. The latrines were in good order and the floors were covered with powdered earth. The excreta are buried in trenches in the Asylum garden. These trenches should be parallel to each other, they should be one foot dsep and one foot wide, and there should be a distance of two feet between every two trenches. There should always be three &deg;r four trenches dug ready for use. There was an ample supply of vegetables under cultivation in the gnrden. The garden was in particularly good order. There were 23 criminal and 68 ncn-criminal male lunatics and 1 female criminal 'Unatic and 23 female non-criminal lunatics in confinement, a total population of 115 They were all assembled for inspection, and most of them appeared to be in a very failly good state of health. Sixteen males were sitting under shelter, making baskets, etc., 6 Women were weaving cloth, 3 were cleaning rice, and 10 were pounding surki.
2 There were 2 sick in hospital, 1 suffering from an abscess and the other from dysentery. There were 31 admissions into hospital in 1895, and 12 have been admitted into hospital this year up to date. There were 7 deaths among the inmates in 1895, 4 from anaemia, 1 from dysentery, 1 from pneumonia and 1 from tetanus. The average population of the Asylum in 1895 was 106*1, so that the death-rate was only 6*59 per cent., a smaller rate of mortality than has been recorded for many years. There have been no deaths among the inmates this year up to date. The Asylum registers were up to date, were in proper order, and appeared to be j correctly kept. The establishment consists of a Hospital Assistant, who carries on the duties oil overseer in addition to those of Subordinate Medical Officer, a jemadar, 9 male and| 3 female warders. There is also a compounder attached to the Hospital. Much credit is due to the Superintendent, Surgeon-Major Macnamara, and tol Hospital Assistant Giris Chandra Das, who is in subordinate charge, for the present| very satisfactory condition of the Asylum.

I have the honour to forward herewith the Annual Report and Returns of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1896. The report has been delayed, because the certificate of sums drawn from, and remitted to, the Tezpur Treasury during the year was not only received late, but had to be returned for correction.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1896. 1. Asylum charge.I was in charge of the Asylum uninterruptedly during the year as Superintendent. Hospital Assistant Giris Chandra Das was in subordinate charge. 2. Buildings, etc.(a) The Asylum buildings were kept in good repair. There were no additions, nor were any alterations made in their general plan. (b) The office and godown building was rethatched and the walls of the solitary cells were cemented and the floors pointed with cement by the Public Works Department, all other repairs were done by the lunatics. These comprised such works as making pucca approaches to the wards, putting down a masonry culvert at the entrance to the Asylum, the renewal of the main gate, and the renewal of the palisade, where required. {c) The use of dry earth in the criminal ward has been continued with advantage, although it has a tendency to cake in the rains. Fine dry sand was tried in some of the male sleeping wards, but it is not as cleanly as leeping, and on sanitary grounds it is not as good, because sanded floors cannot be swept and discharges run through. Unless concrete floors are sanctioned, we shall have to return to leeping. The objection to leeping is that it takes so long to dry, a difficulty that in the case of the female wards is got over by having one newly-leeped barrack unoccupied. 3. Accommodation .--I have had the wards measured during the year, and reproduce the details here : Name of Ward. Air space in cubic feet. Average number of occupants, including Air space per head. Greatest number of occupants on any one night, Remarks. keepers. including keepers. Male A Criminal 16,973 3&laquo; 547 35 B Ward . ... ... 9,8:7 18 545 19 &raquo; t&raquo; i) ... ... ... 9,712 18 539 19 D ... ... ... 9.712 18 539 &quot;9 Hospital ... ... ... ...

A It will be seen that the air space is rather limited, and that the patients do not get in all cases as much room as has been fixed as the minimum limit in jails, although every effort towards a proper distribution of the patients in the wards is made. 4. Clothing and bedding. We now make our own summer clothing, i.e., we no longer buy summer clothing from the Tezpur Jail, as was the practice in former years. It is of the same material, i.e., cotton, but our Asylum cloth is dosnti, whereas the jail cloth supplied was partly eksuti. Our Asylum-made clothes are better put together than those heretofore in use, being double sewn. We buy the cotton, spin and weave it ourselves by female patients, to whom it gives occupation under cover, and in this way we get it cheaper than we could buy it from the jail. Blanket and blanket kurtas were supplied from Bhagalpur jail as in former years. We supplied mattresses and pillows stuffed with straw instead of the usual tat bedding. The result is increased warmth and greater comfort. Fourreen new wooden cots were made during the year to replace old and unserviceable cane-bottomed bamboo charpoys. 5. Drainage.The Asylum drainage is excellent, the site being surrounded by low ground. However, as the drains got wide, deep, and unsightly by consianf. sweeping for many years, we have just filled in most of them, with a view to recutting them later on, on better lines. The grass and weeds taken out of them was for years thrown on their edges, and the result was that they were becoming inefficient. 6. Hospital accommodation.No change. The hospital accommodation is not as good as it might be. The building is less cheerful than the general sleeping wards, and there is not sufficient separation of cases, even as remotely infectious as phthisis or kala-azar. We require such a building as the present office building, but with substantial brick walls instead of plastered ekra. If the cost of the materials for a new hospital was sanctioned, we could build it ourselves. 7. Water supply.No change since last report was submitted. The Asylum well gives a good and constant supply, and all that is required is a good pump. There is a tilter with a cistern attached to the well, but the primitive rope and bucket is still in use for raising the water. 8. Conservancy.No change. We use dry earth freely. There is only one paid sweeper; a second is needed. 9. Admissions and discharges.The following table gives particulars of the admissions and discharges for the past two years and the average of the preceding ten years : 1836. 1895.

io. Escapes.Of the two escapes which occurred, one took place from inside the stockade at night. The lunatic broke open the window of his ward and was missed in the morning. The second escape occurred in the case of a goatherd, who left his charge. Neither of these patients has been traced, although careful search was made and information given to the police and the Deputy Commissioner of their respective districts. They were both non-criminal lunatics in good health. ii.

Total. 1896 1895 Average of previous ten years 6 04 2&quot;8l 3-69 1 95 0-63 2*60 7'99 3-44 6*29 The admissions to hospital have increased, but the increase is owing to the fact that in former years, when we had no Hospital Assistant here, only serious cases of sickness were admitted into the hospital. Now, with a Hospital Assistant in charge as overseer, more notice is taken of slight cases. I think this is as it should be, and I direct attention to the matter, merely to give myself an opportunity of stating here that there was no increase in the number of cases of serious illness during the year under report. Prophylactic treatment, with a view to ward off malarial fever, will be tried for the first time during the coming unhealthy season. By an oversight, probably, details of the method were not communicated to the Asylum, as they were in the case of the jail. There were 7 deaths during the year under report; of which 2 were from phthisis, 1 from diarrhoea, 2 from fever, 1 from apoplexy, 1 from acute cerebritis. Of the 2 phthisis cases; one was received from Dibrugarh in a moribund state and died within 13 days of his admission into the Asylum. Only one criminal lunatic died during the year. Details of the 7 deaths which took place during the year are given below : (1) Remittent fever.Hura Rava, non-criminal, aged 25, received in good health on the nth February 1894 and died on the 1st April 1896, after being 2 years 1 month 17 days in the Asylum. He was admitted for melancholia. (2) Phthisis.Bhato Koch, non-criminal, age 25 years, received in good health on the 16th September 1893. He made no progress towards mental recovery, was very dirty in his habits, and destructive to his clothes. His health declined from July 1895, he was admitted into hospital on the 29th . March last, and died on the 181I1 April. A cavity was found in the upper lobe of the left lung post-mortem. (3) Diarrhcua.Peperu Koch, criminal, age 30 years, received in an indifferent state of health on the 9th July 1889, and died on 12th May 1896, after being in hospital for three days. (4) Phthisis.Samby, non-criminal, age 45 years. This patient was sent from Dibn:garh, and on arrival was found to be in a moribund state and to be suffering from pulmonary consumption in an advanced stage. He was described as dangerous, but no sufficient evidence of insanity was given. This patient, as was anticipated, did no good, ar.d died on the 19th September 1896. His condition was brought to the notice of the Commissioner when he visited the Asylum on 16th September 189^. We saw no signs of insanity about him while here, and I cannot help thinking he should have been put into hospital at Dibrugarh. Post-mortem revealed cavities in both lungs. He died before he could be formally admitted by the committee of visitors. (5) Apoplexy.Mithila, non-criminal, age 25 years, admitted into the Asylum on 17th June 1895, and died on the 1st November 1896. He showed signs of improvement at first, but got violent in August last. He subsequently became so bad that he had to be restrained to prevent him from injuring himself as he tried to knock his head against the wall or the ground. He continued in ihis state till 28th October, when he became quiet. On the night of the 30th October he took his evening meal as usual, and subsequently was noticed quiei. He died of an apopletic seizure.
(6) Intermittent fever.Benella, non-criminal, aged 50, received in an indifferent state of health on the 15th July 1896. On arrival he was violent, abusive, res'less, and aggressive, refusing his food and tearing his clothes. He had a discharge from his ear, and died of intermittent fever on 4th November. (7) Acute cerebritis.Jit Nath, non-criminal, age 25 years, received in bad health on the 27th April 1896. He was a garden coolie, who went naked, refused food and tore up his blankets. He had to be put into a solitary cell. We tried him with straw bedding, which he made into ropes, and passed out through the hole for draining his cell. He was dirty in his habits. He died on the 20th November. The wonder is that he lived so long, as he never kept any covering on. There were signs of cerebral inflammation found post-mortem^ and the ventricles were full of fluid. 21. Cash Accounts.See Statement No. IX.

9 There are no regular paying patients except one Khasi inmate, for whom Rs. 60 is received annually from the Depuiy Commissioner of the Khasi and Jaintia Hills. Garden agreement coolies might be reckoned as paying patients, but it is very difficult to realise the sums spent on the maintenance of such coolies from garden managers. The cash remitted to the treasury on account of the value of the garden produce, etc., was Rs. 253-10-6, against Rs. 218-1-0, showing an increase of Rs. 35-9-6. Rs. 163 shown as lunatics' earnings was money paid by the Public Works Department for the making of the main gate of the Asylum and for the renewal of portions of the palisade. 25.

This is partly due to the fact that we had 300 maunds of rice in stock at the beginning of the year, and that fuel was not purchased since May last, as we managed to collect drift wood. The purchase of paddy instead of rice contributed to this result. The increase in clothing and bedding is due to the payment of Rs. 749-12-0 for the | price of blankets referred to in my last report, which were not paid for in 1895. Under the head &quot; Medicines &quot; the sum of Rs. 50, being the value of European I medicines, has been added to the sum spent on bazar medicines, which was not the case | in previous reports. There is therefore an increase in this head also. The increase in contingencies is due to the following causes : (1) The price of raw cotton and country thread purchased for the looms was shown under this head. (2) Two copper dekchies and 125 enamelled plates were purchased at a cost! of Rs. 50 and Rs. 54 respectively. There is an expenditure of Rs. 233-12 on account of keepers' and chaukidars'l uniforms shown under the head &quot; Miscellaneous,&quot; which is a new item, vide Secretary] to the Chief Commissioner's letter No. 92oMisc.3244J., dated the 3rd August 1896. The increased expenditure under several items is more than counterbalanced by| the decrease in the cost of rice following the purchase of dhan, which we husketf ourselves. 26. Visits.The Asylum was visited by the Director General of the Indian Medj cal Service on the 22nd January 1896. The Chief Commissioner paid two visits. *h( Commissioner of the Assam Valley Districts two, and the Principal Medical Officer a^c Sanitary Commissioner of Assam one visit during the year. Eight meetings of tn^
asylum 11 committee of visitors were held, and copies of their proceedings were forwarded to the Chief Commissioner of Assam, through the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner of Assam. 27. General Remarks.There being ordinarily no separation of the inmates according to the nature of their insanity, considerable difficulty is experienced in getting them to work harmoniously together at several occupations. There has nevertheless been a considerable advance made during the year towards giving the patients healthy occupation at cane work, carpentry, spinning and weaving. It must be particularly trying for a man who committed a crime in a temporary fit and who has to all appearances recovered from his derangement, to have to remain confined in the same ward with maniacs at night. However, this is a matter which cannot be easily dealt with, and, as such cases are not numerous, improvement in other directions, such as a better hospital building, the addition of a pump to the well, &c, &c, are more urgent. We have lowered our milk bill by Rs. 87-14-9 during the year by keeping three cows, and, expending, as we do, about Rs. 33 per month on milk, we might increase our live stock with advantage, as we would be certain to get a purer supply of milk at a lower cost. I have been unable to find among the Asylum papers any record to show our boundaries, and a good piece of the land adjoining the Asylum which we thought was ours, and which we had partially fenced in with a view to cultivation, was taken from us. It would be rather unsatisfactory to have this land let to villagers, and in any case the demarcation of our boundaries is desirable, more especially as we are within municipal limits. The point which usually seems to strike visitors to this Asylum is the apparent harmlessness of the great majority of the patients. I can scarcely believe this is due to any great difference in the cases, but rather to the absence of all appearance of restraint, Three warders were fined during the year for neglect of duty and three resigned of their own free will. Hospital Assistant Giris Chandra Das has taken much interest in his work, and in the welfare of the inmates. S tli r~ DO *&quot; G g Cl, 4) M 2 IB U r&deg;,5 Rs. a. p. o 13 11 087 total. = B V u 0 Q.

Resolution on the Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1896. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, in the Judicial Branch, No. 879/^., dated the i$th March 1897. Read-Letter No. 370C, dated the 4th February 1897, from the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam , forwarding the Annual Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1896. RESOLUTION. Only lunatics from the Brahmaputra Valley and Hill districts are confined in the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum ; those from the Surma Valley are sent to the Dacca Asylum in Bengal. 2. The population of the Tezpur Asylum at the beginning of the year numbered - , .. j , , .. in patients, 8g males and 22 females. Forty-two patients Population and accommodation. *i 1 -? 1 p 1 o Ti were admitted during the year, or whom o were females. Eighteen inmates were discharged, 14 of whom were cured, two were discharged improved, one not improved, and one was transferred to the Lucknow Asylum. There were two escapes and seven deaths. The number of inmates at the close of 1896 was 126, of whom 27 were females. Of the total number, 62 were natives of Assam and 64 belonged to the immigrant classes. The daily average population of the Asylum was 116, against 106 during 1895. There were 23 criminal lunatics on the 1st January 1896, and of the 42 new admissions only nine were criminal lunatics. Three were discharged and one died, leaving 28 at the close of the year, all of whom were males, of a total population of 126. The proportion borne by the non-criminal to the criminal population, 4*5 to 1, is very high as compared with Bengal, where the criminal lunatics in 1895 formed one-half of the total asylum population. Mr. Cotton was impressed on his inspection by the apparently harmless character of the great majority of the inmates of the asylum, and it seemed to him that many persons had been admitted who in Bengal would not have been sent to an asylum. It is observed that Rule 3 on page 16 of the Manual of Executive Rules and Orders, Volume I, in force in Assam, directs that ordinarily only such non-criminal lunatics should be committed to asylums as are dangerous or in the acute stage of insanity. The attention of District Magistrates will be directed to these orders. The Superintendent should in future show in his report the districts from which patients have been admitted, separate figures being given for criminal and non-criminal patients. Mania was the type of insanity from which most of the patients were suffering, and melancholia came next. From Statement No. VII of the Report it would appear that of the 42 admissions, the causes of insanity were ascertained in 15 cases only. Sufficient care is evidently not exercised by medical officers in diagnosing the causes of insanity when drawing up the medical history sheets of lunatics to be admitted to the asylum. Excluding the hospital and the solitary cells, and one female ward which was unoccupied, the accommodation provided 544 cubic feet of air space for each male occupant, and 642 cubic feet for each female, which is ample. The hospital accommodation is reported in paragraph 6 to be capable of improvement: the Principal Medical Officer will be requested to enquire further into the matter. 3. The percentage of admissions to hospital to average strength was 112, as com- Health pared with 29 in 1895, and an average of 49 during the previous ten years. The percentages of deaths to average length for the same periods were 6*01, 6*59, and 12-00, respectively. The Superin. indent of the Asylum attributes the large increase of admissions to hospital to the fac^
2 that only serious cases of illness were admitted prior to the appointment of a Hospital Assistant in 1895. There are no grounds for supposing that the year was an unhealthy one, and the death-rate was oniy 6*oi, the lowest recorded rate since the opening of the asylum in 1876. 7he percentage of deaths to daily average strength in 1895 for asylums throughout India was 10*2. 4. The total expenditure incurred under all heads was Rs. to, 160, compared with Finance Rs. 9,925 in 1895, DUt tne cost Per nea(^ &deg;f average strength was reduced from Rs. 93-8-3 in the preceding year to Rs. 87-4-8. The average cost per head for the whole of India in 1895 was Rs. 98-11-7. The largest reduction of expenditure was effected under dietary charges, which averaged Rs. 30-9-11, against Rs. 47 incurred in 1S95 5 this result was owing partly to the collection of drift wood for fuel, and partly to the fact that the asylum started the year with a stock of 300 maunds of rice. The average number of inmates employed in the manufacturing departments was 48, including 7 women, or 41*3 per cent, of the average population, against 18 8 in 1895. The percentage for all asylums in India in 1895 was 48*3. The larger employment of patients on health-giving employments is a distinctly satisfactory feature, and the Chief Commissioner trusts that the matter will continue to receive the Superintendent's attention. Cane-work, carpentry, spinning and weaving, were the principal occupations on which the patients were employed. The total earnings of the lunatics amounted to Rs. 1,309-10-6, viz., Rs. 892-7-0, the value of the garden and dairy produce, and of the cloths woven by the patients, used in the asylum, and Rs. 416-10-6, cash receipts. 5. The asylum was inspected twice by the Chief Commissioner, once by the Director General of the Indian Medical Service, twice by the Commissioner, and once by the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner. Ihe inspection remarks of the Principal Medical Officer are appended to the Report. Mr. Cotton noticed with pleasure the interest taken in the management of the asylum by Surgeon-Major Macnamara, who was in charge throughout the year, and he feels assured that the unenviable notoriety which the asylum gained in 1894 as the unhealthiest in India, will not recur under Dr. Macnamara's careful supervision. In paragraph 27 of the Report a suggestion is made that the live stock might be increased. The Chief Commissioner will be prepared to consider any proposals which the Principal Medical Officer may make, and he sees no reason why the inmates should not be profitably employed in dairy farming, the produce of which might be sold to the public.

No. 63T. From SURGEON-COLONEL A. STEPHEN, M.B., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF ASSAM. Dated Camp Rarimganj, the 26th February 1898. Sir, I HAVE the honour to forward the Annual Report and Returns of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1897. I also enclose a copy of the remarks which I entered in the Asylum Visitors' Book, when I inspected the Asylum en the 7th of August and 15th of November 1897. In these remarks I have noted the different points on which 1 consider action is required. 2. There were ten deaths reported among the inmates during the year, being 8* 16 per cent, of the average strength. One of the deaths was, however, accidental. A male lunatic was drowned during the earthquake of the 12th of June. A portion of the bank of the Brahmaputra, on which he was standing at the time, gave way, and he was precipitated into the river. Excluding this accidental death, the death-rate due to disease was 7'34 per cent. In 1896, the death-rate was 6*oi per cent., and in 1895, it was 6*59 per cent. The year 1897 was very unhealthy in Assam, and it is quite probable that, if iron and quinine had not been given to the inmates of the Asylum as a prophylactic, the admission and death-rates would have been considerably greater than they were. 3. About 50 of the inmates of the Asylum are engaged in gardening. These men seem to like this form of labour, and, as the occupation is a healthy one, and as a considerable sura is obtained from the sale of the garden produce, I am of opinion that this form of industry should be continued. 4. As noted by the Superintendent in his report, much difficulty is experienced in preparing the statement giving the crimes committed by the criminal lunatics in confinement, in consequence of committing Magistrates not always noting the sections under which these persons are sent to the Asylum. The medical history sheets and descriptive rolls furnished by Deputy Commissioners of persons admitted into the Asylum are also frequently incomplete. 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, A. STEPHEN, M.B., Surgeon-Colonel, Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner* Assam*

Copy of INSPECTION REMARKS made by Surgeon-Colonel A. STEPHEN M.B., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assat?i} on the Tespur Lunatic Asylum, under date the *]th August 1897. I VISITED the Asylum this morning and found that the barrack for criminal prisoners had been so badly damaged during the earthquake that the inmates had to be removed to another barrack. The cook-house was also considerably damaged. The other buildings with ekra walls were very little, if at all, damaged. Several surface drains have been filled up since my last visit. There should be a drain on either side of the main path along the whole length of the enclosure. All the wards were clean, the floors were dry, and no unpleasant smell was perceptible. Arrangements should be made for cutting the grass on the different grass plots in the compound. The ground in front of the cook-house was somewhat wet. A pucca drain should be made from it to the drain outside the enclosure for the removal of the cook-house water. There should also be a pucca platform near the cook-house, on which the vessels containing the food of the inmates should be placed. There were 95 male and 25 female lunatics in the Asylum. Most of them seemed to be in a fairly good state of health. Thirty of the males were at work outside the Asylum, and 47 were employed, to a greater or le&gt;s extent, inside the enclosure. Of the females, 5 were engaged in spinning and weaving, and 4 in husking rice. There were 4 males and 1 female on the sick list ; 2 of the males were suffering from ague, 1 from phthisis, and 1 from skin disease ; the female was suffering from debility. There have been 56 admissions into hospital this year up to date. Of these, 18 were due to ague, 10 to diarrhoea, 6 to dysentery, and 8 to chicken-pox. Since the 1st of January there have been 6 deaths among the inmates. Two deaths were due to phthisis, 1 to erysipelas, 1 to hald-dsdr, 1 to dysentery, and a lunatic was drowned in the river during the earthquake on the 12th of June. Only 7 inmates died during 1896, so that up to date the mortality has been much greater than it was last year. The inmates are getting quinine and iron as a prophylactic, and in addition to their ordinary ration, they get 1 chattack of flour in the early morning in the shape of a chapati, with tea and milk. Copy of the INSPECTION REMARKS on the Tespur Lunatic Asylum, dated the \$th November 1897, by Surgeon-Colon 111 A. STEPHEN, M.B., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam. I INSPECTED the Lunatic Asylum on the 15th November 1897, in the company of the Superintendent, Surgeon-Major Macnamara. The compound was very clean and tidy, and most of the grass plots were in good order. Most of the surface drains have been filled up ; there should be at least two drains, one on either side of the main road. The buildings were in a fairly good state of repair ; the damage done by the earthquake to the criminal ward has been repaired. The roofs of most of the barracks were in want of repairs ; arrangements are being made for rethatching six of the barrack buildings during the cold-weather months. The barrack rooms were very fairly clean. The floors of the male wards were covered with sand. The floor of one of the female barracks was leeped, and the floor of the other one in use was covered with sand. Lecping can be resorted to during the dry months of the year, but the practice is objectionable during the rains, as, when a floor is leeped during the rains, it does not become dry for several days. All the wards, with the exception of the criminal ward, were free from smell. The criminal ward was somewhat close, due to the blankets in use having been stained while in transit from Bhagalpur. These blankets should be washed and thoroughly dried before they are brought into use. The latrines were in fairly good order ; the roofs should, however, be rethatched. The floors were clean, and were covered with sand, as dry earth was not procurable, A he latrines were nearly free from unpleasant smell.
The clothing and bedding were sufficient, and were in good order. One hundred and fifty blankets were received from Bhagaipur on the ist of November. The raw materials of food were of good quality. The damage done to the cookhouse by the earthquake has been repaired, and the cook-house was in very good order. The floor has been cemented, and a small masonry tank for holding water has been provided during the year. The ground in front of the cook-house was somewhat untidy. A masonry drain should be provided for conveying water from the cook-house outside the enclosure. The well from which drinking water is obtained was in good order. It is properly protected, and an efficient platform and a masonry drain have been provided. The garden attached to the Asylum was in very good order, and a large quantity of cabbages and cauliflowers have been planted out. There was also a considerable quantity of sugarcane under cultivation, and 4 maunds of potatoes were planted a few days ago. A considerable number of fruit trees have been planted during the last twelve months. About 50 of the male inmates are at present employed in the garden. These men seemed to be very happy, and the occupation is a very healthy one. Rupees 436 have been obtained from the sale of vegetables, sugarcane, and other produce of the garden during the present year. There were 93 male and 25 female inmates of the Asylum on the date of my inspection. Excluding those sick in hospital, most of the lunatics seemed to be in a fairly good state of general health. Twenty of the males were employed on in-door work, and 3 of the females were weaving, and other 3 were spinning thread. The hospital building is not quite suitable. A new building should be constructed, capable of holding 8 male and 4 female lunatics. The building might consist of corrugated iron walls lined with ckra} and the roof should be made of corrugated iron with a cloth ceiling. The floor should be well raised, and it should be cemented. The building should be so placed that the male ward should be in the male and the female ward in the female enclosure. There were 8 male and 3 female inmates in hospital. Seven of the males were suffering from malarial fever and one from asthma. Two of the females were under treatment for ague and one for cancer of the womb. There have been 85 admissions into hospital this year up to date. Eight of the inmates have died this year : 3 from phthisis pulmonalis, 1 from erysipelas, 1 from kald-dedr, 1 from dysentery, and 1 from diarrhoea, and one man was drowned in the Brahmaputra at the time of the earthquake on the 12th of June. The following is the establishment of the institution : 1 Hospital Assistant and Overseer. 1 compounded 1 jemadar. io male warders. 1 barber. 3 female warders. 2 gate-keepers. 2 sweepers. 1 gardener. Up to date this year 4 criminal and 14 non-criminal male and 2 non-criminal female lunatics have been admitted into the Asylum, a total of 20 persons. Of the male?, U were found to be suffering from mania and 5 from melancholia, and 2 were found not to be insane. Of the females, one was suffering from mania, and one was still under observation. Of the 18 males admitted, the cause of insanity was stated in two cases to have been ^wz/Vz-smoking, and in two other cases separation from their wives. In 14 cases the alleged cause of insanity was not given. The cause of insanity of one of the women admitted was stated to be separation from her husband, and in the other case the cause was not given. The Superintendent informed me that much difficulty is experienced in getting proper medical history sheets and descriptive rolls of persons admitted into the Asylum from the Deputy Commissioners. The registers were up to date and were in proper order. Much credit is due to the Superintendent. Surgeon-Major Macnamara, and to the subordinate medical officer and overseer, Giris Chandra Das, for the satisfactory manner in which they have performed their duties in connection with the Asylum during the present year.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1897. i. Asylum charge. I was in charge of the Asylum uninterruptedly during the year as Superintendent. Hospital Assistant Giris Chandra Das was in subordinate charge, 2. Buildings, etc.(a) The Asylum buildings were kept in good repair. There were no additions, nor were any alterations made in their general plan. (/;) The few masonry-built buildings we have, suffered more or less in the earthquake of 12th June last, but the damage was not extensive, and has been repaired by the Public Works Department. (c) One of the female sleeping wards has been rethatched, and arrangements are now being made to rethatch the two others. The other buildings are in good order, and required only trifling repairs. (d) The floors of the male non-criminal sleeping wards are covered with dry sand, which is changed as soon as the sand becomes damp. We find it impossible to keep up a supply of dry earth for all purposes, and sand has been used as a substitute in the male non-criminal sleeping wards. 3. Accommodation.The Asylum contains accommodation for 90 male and 46 female patients. The greatest numbers confined on any one night were 99 males and 27 females, but overcrowding was prevented by the use of the hospital and the solitary cells. The sleeping wards are occupied only at night, and are freely ventilated through the walls. 4. Chilling and bedding.The summer clothing consists of dhutis and kurtas made in the Asylum by the female lunatics. Blankets and blanket kurtas were supplied from Bhagalpur jail as in former years. The number of wooden cots has been increased by 20 during the year to replace the old and unserviceable cane-bottomed bamboo chirpoys which are objectionable, as they not only harbour bugs, but supply materials for suicide. 5. Drainage.The Asylum drainage is excellent, the site being surrounded by low ground- '1 he old drains which got wider by constant sweeping were filled in, and new drains were cut, towards the latter part of the year. 6. Hospital accommodation. No change. The hospital accommodation is very poor. There is no hospital for female patients. The present hospital building is situated in the male compartment, and is not, therefore, a fit place for females. The Chief Commissioner referred to this matter in the Resolution on last year's report. The Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, in his annual inspection note on the Asylum made on the 16th November 1897, remarked that a building with better accommodation having two separate compartments for males and females between the male and female enclosures, should be constructed, so that the patients of both sexes might be treated in the same building without any communication with each other. A plan and estimate for this building has recently been made by the Executive Engineer, and forwarded to the Principal Medical Officer for approval. 7. Water-supply.No change. The supply is good and abundant. The masonry lilter attached to the well was cracked during the earthquake, but has been thoroughly repaired, and is now in good working order.
8. Conservancy. No change. Dry earth is freely used. There are two paid sweepers, vis., a male and a female, the latter having been appointed during the year. The night-soil is buried in trenches, and the ground subsequently cultivated. 9. Admissions and discharges.The following table gives particulars of the admissions and discharges for the past two years and the average of the preceding ten years : . Male. IS97. 1 I896.

The criminal lunatic was made over to his friends in 1896 under orders of the Local Government, but being uncontrollable, was returned to the Asylum. \ he other was a case of recurrent lunacy, having been discharged &quot;cured&quot; after nine months' residence in the Asylum as far back as 1887. (b) Discharged otherwise.A female lunatic sent from Nowgong was a case of delusional insanity. She was released under orders of the Chief Commissioner and sent back to Mrwgong. (c) EscapesOne female lunatic escaped from the Asylum at night by breaking open the window of the ward. She had made several attempts to escape, but was caught every time. On the last occasion she could not be found, although careful search was made. (d) Admissions classified.The following statement shows the districts from which the newly-admitted lunatics were received during the year under report, separate figures being given fur the criminal and the non-criminal patients.

The only documents that accompany the lunatics are (1) a copy of the order of the Chief Commissioner, directing the lunatics' confinement, (2) a descriptive roll, and (3) a medical history sheet. None of these documents give the information required for the preparation of the above statement. 14 Nationality.Statement No. Ill shows the religion, sex, and distribution according to nationality of the patients admitted during the year. The numbers of Hindus, Muhammadans and other castes were 24, 1 and 2, respectively, against 32, 3 and o, respectively, of 1^96.

The admissions are classified as follows : Mania Melancholia Other forms... Declared to have recovered or not yet diagnosed 1 otal ... ... ... ... '7 7 1 2 27 Under the heading of &quot;Other forms&quot; in the above list, a case of delusional insanity in a woman has been shown. She was a midwife, sent to the Asylum from Nowgong. Her delusion was that she was a lady above her real position,--a belief which made her a nuisance to the residents of Nowgong rather than a fit subject for restraint, as she appeared otherwise harmless. 18. Alleged causes of insanity,See Statement No. VII. Of the total of 27 admissions, 5 are ascribed to physical causes, 2 to moral causes, and 20 are entered as &quot; cause unknown. &quot; The physical causes are allotted as follows : Ganja -smoking Opium-eating... Hard work 3 i 1 It is worth noting that out of 27 admissions, the cause was ascertained in 7 cases only, and was said to be unknown in 20 cases. From the descriptive rolls sent with the lunatics, it would appear that committing Magistrates do not in all cases succeed in ascertaining the causes of insanity, although we have asked for a special inquiry in every such case. The causes, therefore, remain hopelessly unknown in a great many cases. 19. Sickness and mortality.See Statement No. VIII. Out of a total population of 153 lunatics 56, were admitted to hospital during the year, viz., 45 males and 11 females. Of these, 32 were admitted once, 1 5 twice, 6 three times, and 3 four times. The percentage of admissions to hospital and deaths to average strength has been Admissions, Deaths. I Male.

The decrease may possibly be due to the introduction of the prophylactic treatment of the lunatics with quinine during the. unhealthy season of the year, vis,, from 1st Jure to 30th November. 20. Total mortality.The total number of deaths was 10, or 8* 16 per cent, of average strength, as compared with 7 and 6'oi per cent, in 1896. The mortality was therefore higher than that of last year. One death was, however, quite an accident. A male patient was pulling a log of wood out of the river on 12th June, and when the earthquake of that date occurred, the bank gave way, and he was drowned. This would leave us 9 deaths only, of which 3 were from phthisis, 1 from diarrhoea, 2 from dysentery, 1 from erysipelas, 1 from kald-dsdr, and 1 from uterine disease. 21.

This scarcely requires explanation, as the drawings from the treasury van' according to the sanctioned expenditure.
7 The reasons for the increase in the expenditure for the year under report are given bel o\v (i) Establishment proper.There is an increase of Rs. 595-13-1 1 under this subhead, which is due to the entertainment of two additional keepers aid an additional sweeper (rendered necessary owing to the increase of inmates in the Asylum), and also to the compensation allowance paid to the Asylum servants on account of clearness of provisions. (2) Diet,Under this sub-head a sum of Rs. 2,547-10 was spent in excess of the previous year. This increase is due to the following three causes : First,A supply of 300 maunds of rice which was paid for in the year 1S95, was utilised in the year 1895, as describee in paragraph 25, Section C of the report for last year. This meant a 1 eduction of about Rs. 1,00c in the diet expenditure for the year 1S96, whereas there was no such supply in stock for the year under report. Secondly,The cost of provisions for the year under report was much higher than that in the previous year. Thirdly,There was an increase in the number of inmates from a daily average of 116*37 m ^96 to 122*55 in the year under report. {3) English medicines. Under this sub-head there was an increase of Rs. 201-6 during the year under report over that for the year 1S96. This was due to the fact that prophylactic treatment of the lunatics was introduced during the year under report, audit cost about Rs. _oo to purchase quinine iron, and sulphuric acid, whereas there was no such expenditure in the previous year. 22.

Only a male keeper, a female keeper, and a sweeper have been entertained during the year, in addition to those already entertained during the previous year.

to There was only one regular paying-patient, viz., a Khasi referred to in last yeir's report, for whom Rs. 60 was received from the Deputy Commissioner of the Khasi and Jaintia Hills. Of the balance of the maintenance receipts, Rs. 116 was received from the manager of a tea garden for one agreement coolie who had been an inmate of the Asylum for a long time and was discharged during the year under report. The remaining, Rs. 142-11, was partly cash found on the persons of patients on admission, and partly diet expenses realised from the relatives of persons put under observation. 26. Visits.During the year under report the Asylum was visited twice by the Chief Commissioner, three times by the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, and once by the Judge and Commissioner, Assam Valley Districts. Nine meetings of the committee of visitors were held during the year under report, and the copies of their proceedings were sent, as usual, to the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner for transmission to the Local Government. 27. General re?narks.The proposal to increase our live-stock this year was held in abeyance, as there was an epidemic of cattle-disease which somewhat upset our plans. Besides our land is limited in area. The Commissioner has, however, just seen our boundaries and has suggested changes which may facilitate the proposed scheme. The confinement of all the female patients in one enclosure without means of separation by clay when they quarrel, is a drawback. A solitary cell for females is a desideratum. The Commissioner of the Assam Valley Districts, when he last visited the Asylum, suggested certain additions to the Asylum lands, partly with a view to the increase of agricultural pursuits and partly to prevent villages from rising up close to the. Asylum. As the land in front of the Asylum is being given up by the Jail Department, this is considered a suitable time to take it up for the purposes of the Asylum. The criminal ward is not quite large enough to accommodate all the criminal lunatics at present confined. The asylum now contains two more criminal lunatics than the criminal ward was intended to accommodate. The excess find room with the non-criminals. The rules put in force during the year limit the releases of criminal lunatics, and it is probable this clais will increase so as in time to give the proportion of the criminal to the non-criminal class now existing in Bengal Asylums. The separation of criminal lunatics in separate apartments at night will soon need consideration. The Asylum servants, on the whole, worked well and gave little trouble. This is mainly owing to the good temper of Hospital Assistant Giris Chandra Das and the interest taken by him in his work. Tespitr, The 22nd : January 1898. J. W. U.

Read-Letter No. 63T., dated the 25th February 189S, from the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam, forwarding the Annual Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1897. RESOLUTION. Only lunatics from the Brahmaputra Valley and Hill Districts are confined in the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum : those from the Surma Valley are ent to the Dacca Asylum in Bengal. 2. The population of the Tezpur Asylum at the beginning of the year numbered 126 patients, 99 males and 27 females, and at the close of the year there were 118 patients, 94 males and 24 females, of whom 60 were natives of Assam, 53 were coolie immigrants, while the nationality of 5 patients was unknown. On the 1st of January 1897, there were 28 criminal lunatics, against 30 at the close of the year. The Superintendent and the Principal Medical Officer bring to notice that difficulty is experienced in preparing the statement giving the crimes committed by criminal lunatics in confinement. In future, this information should always be given by Magistrates when forwarding criminal lunatics to the Asylum. Out cf the 20 non-criminal lunatics admitted during the year, it appears that 7 came from the Lakhimpur and 6 from the Darrang districts, and it is evident that sufficient attention was not paid by the Deputy Commissioners to the rule which enjoins that ordinarily only such non-criminal lunatics should be committed to Asylums as are dangerous or in the acute stage of insanity. The female ward has unfortunately been burnt down since the close of the year, but advantage will be taken in rebuilding it to remedy the defects pointed out by the Superintendent. Separate hospital accommodation for females is needed, and this also should be provided during the current year. 3. The percentages of admissions to hospital and of deaths to daily average population were 75*07 and 8'16, respectively, as against 11171 and 6'oi in the preceding year. The increased death-rate is accounted for by the exceptional unheahhiness of the year. Iron and quinine were administered to the lunatics as prophylactics from the 1st June to the 30th November. Of the ten deaths which occurred, one was accidental. A male patient was pulling a log of wood out of the river on the 12th June when the earthquake occurred. The bank gave way, and he fell into the river and was drowned. 4. The expenditure for the year amounted to Rs. 13,057-11-0, as against Rs. 10,500-5-0 in 1896 ; the cost per head of the average strength was Rs. 103-15-2, as compared with Rs. S7-4-S in 1896, and Rs. 93-8-3 in 1895, the increase being due chiefly to the high price of provisions. The average cost per head for the whole of India in 1896 was Rs. 105-9-0. The net profit from the manufacturing department was Rs. 1,090-j-7, against Rs. 1,069-10-5 in 1896. The total earnings of the lunatics amounted to Rs. 1,320-5-31 vte.t Rs. 791 -14-9, value of garden and dairy produce, and of cloths woven by the
patients, used in the Asylum, and Rs. 528-6-6 cash receipts. The proposal to increase the live-stock was held in abeyance on account of an epidemic of cattle-disease. 5. The Chief Commissioner visited the Asylum twice, the Commissioner once, while the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner paid three visits during the year. The inspection remarks of the Principal Medical Officer are appended to the Report. The Chief Commissioner's acknowledgments are due to Surgeon-Major Macnamara for his careful report and his efficient management of the x^sylum. It is proposed to take up the land in front of the Asylum, which is being given up by the jail, in order to extend the dairy. This wi!lkbe a step in the right direction, as dairying is a suitable occupation for the inmates of the Asylum, as well as profitable to the Institution. Mr. Cotton is aware that some attempt has been made to provide suitable amusements for the lunatics, as has been done successfully in other provinces, and is glad that this matter has Dr. Macnamara's attention. By order of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, F. J. MONAHAN, Offg, Secretary to the Chief Commissioner 0/ Assam. A. S. P. O. (Judl) No. 33-l52~5-5-98.

From No. 527C. COLONEL C. W. CARR-CALTHROP, M.D., Ch. D., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF ASSAM. Dated Camp Silchar, the 6th March 1S99. SIR, I HAVE .the honour to submit the Annual Report and Returns of the Lunatic Asylum, Tezpur, for the year 1898. This report reached me with a rough print proof yesterday. I also beg to forward a copy of remarks which I recorded on my visits to the Asylum in October and December 1898. 2. Both the death-rate and the constantly sick rate have fallen considerably, not only as compared with the last year, but also with the average of the ten preceding ones ; this is very satisfactory, and is the result partly of the general salubrity of the year and partly of the more liberal use of iron and quinine as prophylactics. 3. The garden finds occupation for the majority of the inmates, and sufficient vegetables are produced not only for consumption by themselves, but also for sale outside, and the sums thus realised tend materially to decrease the cost of the institution. 4. I should like to see more lime trees, especially of the good &quot; Khagazi &quot; variety, grown, so that lime juice and lime pickle might be prepared for issue to our jails and dispensaries. Castor oil plants might also be planted and a simple form of oil-mill procured ; so that a part, at all events, of the castor oil required for medicinal purposes might be home grown and home produced, to the advantage of all concerned. 5. It is much to be regretted that the scheme for starting a dairy farm in connection with this Asylum could not be gone on with ; the initial cost of purchasing milch cattle and the poor yield of milk likely to be got from them, rendered it financially impossible. 6. Other points of interest are referred to in my inspection remarks. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant. C. W. CARR-CALTHROP, M.D., Ch. D., Colonel, I.M.S., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam.

Copy of INSPECTION REMARKS made by Colonel C. W. CARR-CALTHROP, I.M.S., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, on th e Tezpur Lunatic Asylum, under date the &sect;th October 1898. I visited and inspected the Asylum this morning in company with Major Macnamara, Superintendent. The most noticeable fact concerning the housing of the inmates is the very excellent ward under construction for the accommodation of the non-criminal lunatics ; but arrangements should be made, if possible, for subdivision of the criminals into classes, viz., those who are filthy in their habits and those who are not. It is almost enough to make a sane man mad to lock him up all night with such filthy brutes as many of these unfortunates have become. Further accommodation for separate confinement of females is also to be greatly desired. The staff of sweepers does not seem to be sufficient to get the wards and latrines cleaned up by a sufficiently early hour : this is a matter which always gives trouble in Asylums, and the establishment should be kept as strong as passible. At present the lunatic population consists of Criminal J^on&raquo;criminai ... Male. 33 69 Female. 3 24 Total M&raquo; 102 and to meet their sanitary requirements, there are only two sweepers. I think one more should be provided at once. There were only three males in hospital, one a case of compound fracture of the ulna, done by another inmate; and one female with a contused wound on the scalp, also the result of a quarrel. The general appearance of the whole institution, its buildings and gardens, the cooking arrangement and clothing were all very satisfactory, and show the untiring industry of Major Macnamara in looking after every small detail, and also reflect great credit on Hospital Assistant Giris Chandra Das, who is in subordinate medical charge and also the executive overseer. Copy of INSPECTION REMARKS made by Colonel C. W. CARR-CALTHROP, I.M.S., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum, under date the 10th December 1898. I visited the Asylum this morning in company with Major J. W. Macnamara, I.M.S. the Superintendent, for the purpose of making my annual inspection. 1. The grounds are neatly laid out and the boundaries have been defined by pillars erected during the current year, and the area of the garden has been increased by the cultivation of more ground. An experimental sowing of castor plants will be made shortly to see whether it would not be more economical to grow and manufacture our own castor oil for medicinal use throughout the province. 2. The buildings are not altogether satisfactory ; the new female ward, for which * sum of Rs. 8,091 was sanctioned, has been constructed under the superintendence of Major Macnamara and the overseer in charge, and is now nearly complete. It will be a great addition and will afford much wanted accommodation. At present there is only &deg;ne shed for use in the female enclosure, and when this is full, the remainder of the
women have to be taken out and locked in a shed in the portion of the Asylum which should be reserved for males only. This practice will, I am glad to say, soon be done away with. A new hospital is also much wanted, and it is to be hoped that a grant of money may soon become available for its construction. A new ward for criminal males is also wanted, and as the number of these is steadily increasing, expenditure on this head will have to be faced sooner or later. 3. A new house for the Hospital Assistant, who is also the overseer, has been built at an expense of Rs. 450 only to Government, the bulk of the labour having been supplied free. Four new culverts have been added to the existing ones, and a pucca drain and a platform have been made near the cook-shed. The top of the well in the female ward has been planked over, and a small masonry platform provided. 4. The clothing of the inmates is good and sufficient, the cotton portion being made by the patients, and the blankets brought from Bhagalpur. 5. The number of inmates is gradually increasing, and at the time of my visit there were 128 in all, classified as follows : Criminal Non-criminal Total Male. Female. Total. 36 92 33 68 101 3 24 27 128 During the year the number of admissions was 29; the affections giving rise to them being Male. Female. Total. Mania ... ... ... ... 14 7 21 Melancholia ... ... ... 7 ... 7 Idiocy ... ... ... I ... 1 Total 22 29 The origin of these affections is found to have been due to ganja-smoYmg in the case of 4 males, alchoholi3m in 1, but in the remaining 17 cases, amongst the men, the cause is not known. The insanity of the women is supposed to be due to hereditary influence in 1 case, family affliction in 1 case, other acute illness in 2 cases, and not known in the 3 remaining. 6. On the date of my visit there were 4 cases in hospital, all males, viz., 2 cases of ague, i of dysentery, and 1 of ansemia. During the year, 86 cases have required admission into the hospital for diseases which are shown in the table subjoined : Ague Remittent fever Bronchitis ... Asthma Ulcer Hoemoptysis Diarrhoea ... Djsentery ... Influenza Otorrhoea Abscess Gumboil Rheumatism Fracture of ulna Wound of scalp Anaemia Total Male. Female. Total. 16 . 8 24 I ... I I ...

The cases were not very severe, and only a small percentage of the population was attacked. The case of fracture of the ulna was a bad compound one, caused by one lunatic beating another at night with a piece of bamboo, which he broke out from the window. Fortunately the guards were alert, and the men were separated before more damage was done. The cases of scalp wound were due to a quarrel between two women. 8. From May to October a prophylactic issue of quinine, sulphate of iron, and dilute sulphuric acid was given to all the inmates, except a few violent ones. The good effects of this are evidently apparent as shown by the small number of cases of malarial fever. 9. There have been five deaths up to date in this ye?r t three males, one each from dysentery, diarrhoea and remittent fever, and 2 women, one from dysentery and one old age and debility. 10. A most satisfactory amount has been realised by the sale of vegetables, bricks, etc., nearly six hundred rupees having been remitted to the treasury and about the same sum being still due from the Public Works Department. 11. A magic lantern and some native musical instruments have been provided for the amusement of the patients, which, it is hoped, may tend to alleviate their affliction. 12. The establishment has been strengthened by the addition of one sweeper, and it is now sufficient for present needs. 13. Hospital Assistant Giris Chandra Das has been in subordinate charge during the whole year, and has excellently well justified his appointment as overseer in addition to his medical duties, and the satisfactory state of the whole institution is due in no small degree to his diligence, tact, and assiduity. 14. Major Macnamara has been Superintendent during this year as in several preceding ones, and has managed the affairs of the Asylum thoroughly to my satisfaction. being : there rise to I in the jn, the reditary nd not :ases of diseases

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1898. 1. Asylum charge.I was in charge of the Asylum uninterruptedly during th year as Superintendent. Second-grade Hospital Assistant Giris Chandra Das was in subordinate charge. 2. Buildings, etc,(a) The Asylum buildings were kept in good repair. (b) Four buildings in the female compartment of the Asylum were destroyed on the night of the 10th March by a fire believed to have been malicious in its origin. The occurrence was reported at once to the Principal Medical Officer and a police inquiry instituted, as there was reason to believe fire was thrown over the boundary palisade on to a thatched roof. There was naturally much confusion among the inmates, but beyond the destruction of property no injury was caused. To replace the houses which were burned down, an iron-roofed building on an approved plan and with a well-raised pucca plinth was sanctioned at an estimated cost of Rs. 8,000. This building is now approaching completion. Meanwhile, temporary accommodation was provided. We were fortunate in having a good supply of Asylum-made bricks at hand, and the new house provided work for a large number of the inmates during the year under report. (c) The kutcha floors of the male non-criminal sleeping-wards are covered with dry sand, which is changed at intervals, as it becomes damp, because leeping in permanently-occupied buildings is, when it has to be frequently repeated, considered objectionable. (d) The drainage of the Asylum is good, and even in heavy rain there is no trouble from this cause. 3. Accommodation.Before the fire of 10th March the Asylum furnished accommodation for 90 male and 46 female patients, but owing to the destruction of the female sleeping-wards in part, as before described, we wrere left with accommodation for only 30 females. The greatest numbers confined in any one night were 103 males and 28 females, but overcrowding was prevented by the use of the hospital and the solitary cells. The sleeping-wards are occupied only at night and are well ventilated through the walls which are made of mats. We have accommodation for 31 male criminal lunatics only, whereas the number at present confined is 33. As the number of this class of patients is gradually increasing, further accommodation will have to be arranged for at some future time. The number confined in excess of the scale find room with the non-criminals. No separation of criminal and non-criminal female patients at night is possible at present, but a step in this direction might be made as soon as the new female ward is ready for occupation. 4. Clothing and bedding. The summer clothing consisting of dhutis and kurtas is made in the Asylum by the female patients. During the year blankets and blanket kurtas were purchased from the Bhagalpur Central Jail as usual. The ^harpoys destroyed in the fire have been replaced by wooden cots.
5. Hospital accommodation.The male hospital building is not a very suitable one, and is not much used on this account. There is no hospital accommodation for females. An estimate framed to remove the latter defect was rejected for financial reasons, and the want will be considerably less felt when we bring the new female ward into use. 6. Water-supply.No change. The supply is good and abundant, and the well has a masonry filter attached. The water is drawn by a rope and bucket from a deep well, and is used for all purposes, as it is our only supply. 7. Conservancy.No change. Dry earth continues to be freely used. The latrine in the female yard, which was burned down, has been replaced by a more substantial one. The night-soil is trenched in the Asylum grounds and the place tilled later on, as has been the custom heretofore. Towards the close of the year an extra sweeper was sanctioned, making 3 in all. The refuse from the cook-house is now removed by a pucca drain, which was made during the year. A small space in front of the cook-house, which heretofore was often wet and dirty, was neatly, paved with brick, 8.

She was recaptured and sent back to the Asylum on 24th March 1898 by the Deputy Commissioner of Nowgong. Her case was referred to in last year's report. (b) Not improved.A woman, non-criminal, sent with an infant from Goalpara, and a Khasi were made over to their friends under the orders of the Local Government. These two patients were believed to be not dangerous. A difficulty arose in connection with the child in the first case, and in the second doubtless the inadvisability of sending a hillman to an Asylum in the plains was considered by the Chief Commissioner. It has been decided that non-criminal lunatics who are not dangerous are not suitable subjects for admission, and that natives of the hills should be received only when they are either criminal or a source of serious danger to themselves or others. This is especially the case if ihey have friends who are able and willing to take care of them. (c) Escapes.When the fire occurred on the ioth of March, two lunatics escaped, but were re-captured almost immediately. A man put under observation by order of the Deputy Commissioner of Darrang escaped from the Asylum on 24th November. Careful search was made for this man and notice sent to the lecal police, but so far no trace of him has been found.
(d) Admissions classified.The following statement shows the districts from which lunatics were received in 1898, and is interesting, as it shows that more non-criminal patients were received from Darrang than from all the rest of the districts in the province, which furnish inmates, taken together.

Committing Magistrates, with few exceptions, fail to let us know the section under which criminal lunatics are sent to the Asylum, so that there is still difficulty in preparing the foregoing statement. 13.

The number of Hindus, Muhammadans, and other castes were 21, 4, and 3, respectively, against 24, 1, and 2, respectively, of 1897. One native Christian, a garden coolie, was admitted during the year. 14. Previous occupation.Statement No. IV gives the previous occupation of the patients admitted during the year. The figures since the opening of the Asylum are: Agriculturists Coolies ... Beggars ... Sepoys ... Servants ... Other occupations Total 252 284 30 28 24 138 756 15.

Of the total 29 admissions, 7 were ascribed to physical causes, 3 to moral causes, and in the case of the remaining 19 patients, the causes are unknown. The causes assigned are as follows : Physical. Ga n\ja- smoking 3 Spirit-drinking 1 Fever 1 Dysentery... 1 Hereditary 1 Moral. Death of wife ... 1 Death of son ... 1 Death of husband ... 1 Total Total It will thus be seen that out of 29 admissions, the cause was ascertained in 10 cases only, and was said to be unknown in 19 cases. From the descriptive rolls sent with the lunatics, it would appear that committing Magistrates seldom succeed in
ascertaining the cause of insanity, although we have asked for a special inquiry in every such case. The causes, therefore, remain hopelessly unknown in the great majority of cases. 18. Sickness and mortality.See Statement No. VIII. Out of a total population of 147 lunatics, 73 were admitted to hospital during the year, viz., 56 males and 17 females. Of these, 61 were admitted once, 11 twice, and 1 four times. The percentage of admissions to hospital and deaths to average strength have been Year. Admissions. Deaths. Male. Female. Total. Male.

It would appear that the comparative healthiness of the inmates was, at any rate, in part due to the general use of iron and quinine during the unhealthy season of the year, i.e., from May to November. 19. Total mortality.The total number of deaths was 5, or 4*03 per cent, of average strength, as compared with 10 deaths, or 8*i6 per cent, in 1897.

Sanctioned Establishment.Statement No. X.An additional sweeper was entertained during the last two months of the year, as it was found impossible to get the Asylum cleaned up before midday with the establishment we had. This was done on the recommendation of the Principal Medical Officer, sanction having been obtained in the ordinary way. The place of one female-keeper has been vacant since April last, as we could not get a woman to fill it. An application made to the Superintendent of the Berhampur Lunatic Asylum to try to procure a female warder was of no use, as we could induce no one to come on Rs. 10, which was the pay offered. 24.

io The sum of Rs. 278-13-0 shown as received from paying patients was all received from the managers of gardens for their coolies, as in the only case in which we had a so-called paying patientthat of a Khasiwe have so far been unable to realise payment through the Deputy Commissioner. A small sum was realised from the relatives of persons put in under observation. 25. Visits.During the year under report the Asylum was visited twice by the Chief Commissioner and twice by the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner. Seven meetings of the Committee were held and copies of their proceedings sent in all cases to the Principal Medical Officer for transmission to the Local Government. 26. General remarks.A sum of Rs. 200 was provided during the year, with a view to supplying the patients with amusements of some kind, and with this object a magic lantern, books, native musical instruments, playing-cards, and dice were purchased. After much consideration it was decided to abandon the dairy-farm project. At best it would not be a very safe one with cattle-disease recurring so frequently, it was found too that the initial outlay was very considerable. The Asylum boundary has been properly defined during the year, and a portion of land formerly held by the Jail Department was annexed and the whole marked by boundary pillars. It will be easy in future to secure the retention of a considerable area and prevent encroachment on that area by villagers. A few lunatics received trifling injuries from other patients during the year, the most serious being a fracture of the ulna by a blow from a bamboo. We allow the great majority of the inmates to go, in charge of keepers, to any public amusements that are being held, to see the Durga Pujas and the local races every year. Although as much freedom as possible is allowed, it is exceptionable to find that any harm is caused, while the benefit gained is incalculable. When a Hospital Assistant was sanctioned as overseer, I was allowed to make my own selection among the junior Hospital Assistants, (and the resujt of the departure was that much responsibility was thus thrown on me. The progress which has since been made in every direction fully justifies the selection I made in taking Hospital Assistant Giris Chandra Das, who has been in subordinate charge since October 1895, and who has given much satisfaction. Were it not for his presence of mind when the fire occurred, the whole place might have been burned down. I was away on inspection duty at the time, and the temporary arrangements he made were excellent. Tespur, The 2gth January 1899. J. W. U.

Resolution on the Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1898. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the General Department, No. 1498^., dated Shillong, the 21st April 1899. Read-Letter No. 527C, dated the 6th March 1899, from the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam, forwarding the Annual Report of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1898. RESOLUTION. Only lunatics from the Brahmaputra Valley and Hill districts are confined in the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum : those from the Surma Valley are sent to the Dacca Asylum, in Bengal. 2. At the beginning of the year there were 118 patients in the Tezpur Asylum, 94 males and 24 females, and at the close of the year there were 125 patients, 99 males and 26 females, of whom 60 were natives of Assam, 62 were coolie immigrants, while the nationality of 3 patients was unknown. There were 36 criminal lunatics at the close of the year, against 30 at its commencement. It is stated that committing Magistrates, with few exceptions, still fail to let the Asylum authorities know the sections under which criminal lunatics are sent to the Asylum. The recurrence of this complaint is unsatisfactory, and the Chief Commissioner must impress upon Magistrates the necessity of stating, when forwarding criminal lunatics to the Asylum, the offences with which they are charged and the section of the Criminal Procedure Code under which committal is made. Of the 21 non-criminal lunatics admitted during the year, no fewer than 11 came from the Darrang district, of which Tezpur is the headquarters. In the previous year also a disproportionate number of the non-criminal lunatics admitted were natives of Darrang, and it is evident that in this district proper discretion has not been exercised in sending lunatics to the Asylum. 3. Four buildings in the female compartment of the Asylum were destroyed on the night of the 10th March 1898 by a fire which is believed to have been maliciously caused. To replace them, the erection of an iron-roofed building at an estimated cost of Rs. 8,ooo was sanctioned, and it is now approaching completion. The Chief Commissioner was compelled, owing to financial considerations, to reject a proposal for the construction of a new hospital at a cost of Rs. 4,048, but the want of hospital accommodation will be less felt when the new female ward is completed. 4. The percentages of admissions to hospital and of deaths to daily average population were 70*17 and 4*03, respectively, as against 75*07 and 815 per cent, in the preceding year. The average percentage of mortality for the ten years 1887-96 was 11 &quot;24. The great decrease in the death-rate of the Asylum is a gratifying result of increased care for the health and comfort of the inmates, and especially of the liberal use of iron and quinine as prophylactics. 5. The expenditure for the year amounted to Rs. 13,273, as compared with Rs&laquo; I3&gt;&deg;S7'* l m the preceding year ; the cost per head of the average population was Rs. 104-12-11, as against Rs. 103-15-2 in 1897 and Rs. 87-4-8 in 1896. The average cost per head in lunatic asylums throughout India in 1897 was Rs. 113-12-8. One additional sweeper was entertained during the year. The net profit from the manufacturing department was Rs. 1,592-14-3, against Rs. 1,090-6-7 in the preceding year. The total earnings of the lunatics amounted to Rs. 2,225-0-6, viz.} Rs. 825-2 value of garden and daily produce and of clothes manufactured by the patients, which were used ln the Asylum, and Rs. 1,399-14-6 cash receipts.
6. Steps were taken during the year to define properly the boundaries of the Asylum land, which have now been marked by pillars. It was found necessary to abandon the project of starting a dairy farm in connection with the Asylum, in view of the heavy initial cost which it would involve. A sum of Rs. 200 was expended on the purchase of a magic lantern, books, musical instruments, and other articles for the amusement of the patients. 7. The Asylum was visited twice by the Chief Commissioner and twice by the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner during the year. The inspection remarks of the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner are appended to the report. 1 he Chief Commissioner desires to place on record his appreciation of the unremitting interest and attention bestowed on the Asylum by Major Macnamara, who has recently proceeded on furlough after holding charge of the institution for a period of nearly six years. Mr. Cotton has also read with satisfaction the Superintendent's favourable notice of the services of Babu Girish Chandra Das, the Hospital Assistant attached to the Asylum. By order of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, F. J. MONAHAN, Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam. A. S. P. 0. (Genl.) No. 538315222-4*99

No. 388C. From COLONEL C. W. CARR-CALTHROP, M.D., Ch.D., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF ASSAM. Dated Shillong, the \2tI1 February 1900. Sir, I HAVE the honor to submit the Annual Report and Returns of the Lunatic Asylum, Tezpur, for the year 1899. I also beg to forward a copy of remarks which I recorded on my visit to the Asylum in November 1S99. 2. It is satisfactory to note that the number of admissions into the hospital has considerably fallen since the introduction of prophylactic treatment among the lunatics. The increase in the,death-rate, as compared with the last year, is mainly due to 4 deaths from malarial fever. The total number of deaths was 9, i.e., 7*11 per cent. Statement No. VIII shows that there were 25 admissions for ague and 6 for anaemia due to ague, or 31 in all. Out of these, 4 cases died: this is a very high percentage; and it is open to doubt whether the disease these four lunatics suffered from was really malarial fever, or fever of some more unusual kind not readily recognised. The attention of the Superintendent will be invited to this point for guidance during the coming year. 3. A number of lime trees have been planted, and more seedlings will be put out year by year. 4. Other points of interest are referred to in my inspection remarks. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, C. W.

Copy of the REMARKS made by Colonel C. W. Carr-Calthrop, /M.S., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, in the visitors' book of the Lunatic Asylum, Tespur, dated the *]th November 1899. I visited and inspected the Lunatic Asylum, Tezpur, this morning in company with Major Hall, the Superintendent. The grounds are nicely laid out, and the garden is flourishing. Nearly 1 acre was planted out with castor-oil seeds, but unfortunately the plants were all destroyed by the unusually heavy rains. The experiments should be repeated. Sixty good Kaghazi lime trees have been planted and are doing well. The number of lime trees should be raised until it equals the number of inmates, and then 10 per cent, should be planted annually to make up for losses. 2. A new ward for females has been constructed during the past year and is now in use. This is a great comfort. A small hospital for women is still required, and should be constructed on the site of the old barrack, part of the plinth of which might possibly be made use of. 3. A hospital for men is very much needed, and it is hoped that funds may be available next year. A small isolation ward is also required for male criminals, in which cirty cases could be kept. The intolerably filthy habits of some of these poor wretches make them most dreadfully disagreeable companions at night time, and a small ward for their isolation is a necessity. 4. An excellent pucca drain round the female ward and down to the outside enclosure has been made, and will do much to keep it clean and dry. 5. A godown is required near the office for miscellaneous articles, rations, etc. At the time of my visit the compounder was living with the Hospital Assistant in charge, as his quarters were full of rice recently imported from Calcutta. This is not desirable, and a suitable godown is required before the buildings can be considered complete. 6. The rations were good, and the inmates looked robust and well fed. Their clothing was as during last year and quite suitable. 7. There were 127 inmates on the day of my inspection, classified as follows: Criminal , Non-criminal Total Male. Female. Total. 34 4 38 67* 22 89 101 26 127 * Including 2 under observation. 8.

During the year, 8o cases requried admission into hospital for various affections, including 25 cases of malarial fever, 17 of diarrhoea, and 11 of dysentery. A prophylactic issue of quinine and iron was given from May to October to all the inmates, except a few fractious individuals, and it certainly seems to have done good. Four grains of quinine with 2 grains of sulphate of iron and 10 minims of dilute sulphuric acid were given once every day in the morning before they went to work. 12. Up to date, 6 inmates have died4 males and 2 females. Of the males, 3 died from anaemia and 1 from dysentery ; of the females, 1 died from diarrhoea and i from dysentery. One of the men had been in ihe Asylum over 12 years and another nearly 11 years. . 13. One criminal lunatic escaped on the evening of October 18th, and has not yet been recaptured. 14. The amount earned by the lunatics has been much increased. Rupees 744-9*9 has been received by the sale of vegetables, pur, paddy, plantains, etc.; Rs. 173-8 from the Public Works Department for cart hire and coolie labour; Rs. 262-10-4 has been recovered as cost of maintenance from the relatives of patients ; and all these items have been remitted to the treasury. 15. Attention is paid to giving amusement to the patients by showing them magic lantern pictures and by music, and a microscope has been purchased at a cost of Rs. 45-7 to enable the Hospital Assistant in charge to diagnose cases of an-chylostomiasis. 16. Hospital Assistant Giris Chandra Das has been in charge all the year, except for a short time on privilege leave. He has done excellently good work, and fully kept up his reputation; 17. Major Macnamara was Superintendent for the first three months, when he was succeeded by Major Hall, under whose capable and skilful arrangements the management has been quite&quot; satisfactory.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1899. 1. Asylum charge.Lieutenant-Colonel J. W. U. Macnamara was Superintendent I of the Asylum for the first three months cf 1899. On his going on furlough I was put I in charge, and remained so to the end of the year. Second-grade Hospital Assistant Giris Chandra Das was in subordinate charge cf the Asylum for the whole year, with [ the exception of two months (13th June to 12th August), when he went on privilege leave, and Second-grade Hospital Assistant Ram Lochan Das acted for him. 2. Buildings, etc.(a) The Asylum buildings were kept neat, clean, and in good order. (b) The iron-roofed building in the female enclosure, begun in the latter part of 1898, was finished during the year under report. It removes much inconvenience formerly felt in lodging the female lunatics. It is still very desirable that a separate house with brick walls should be provided for those female lunatics who are violent and dirty in their habits, as they destroy the ekra walls. (c) The kutcha buildings for the male lunatics are a constant source of anxiety, as they may be set on fire at any moment by maliciousness or carelessness on the part of some lunaticsan occurrence which would probably cause a terrible loss of life. Lunatics also find no difficulty in escaping from them. They ought to be replaced as soon as possible by zinc-roofed buildings. Constantly renewed dry sand is used on kutcha floors to prevent dampness. (d) The drainage of the Asylum is good. Even after heavy rain no water lodges in the Asylum. The new pucca drain from the new female ward has been extended to the outside drain. (e) There is no godown for storing grain, etc. ; consequently it has to be kept in the solitary cells, or in outside sheds built for warders, where it is liable to be destroyed by fire, stolen, or damaged. This year the supply of rice from Calcutta has been stored in the compounder's quarters, necessitating the compounder sharing the Hospital Assistant's house. An iron-roofed building with brick walls is urgently needed for this purpose. 3- Accommodation.Additional accommodation for lunatics will also be required, as there is only accommodation for go males and 30 females, and on one occasion there were 103 males and 28 females in the Asylum, therefore overcrowding could not be avoided even by using the hospital and solitary cells. There is only one iron-roofed building r lne use of male criminal lunatics accommodating 28, whereas at the end of the year there were 33 male criminals, of whom no less than 13 were violent and of dirty abits. As it is veiy desirable that the quiet lunatics should be kept apart from these, 1 would suggest that a second4iron-roofed building be provided to accommodate at least 5- 4&laquo; Clothing and bedding.The female patients made the greater portion of the mmer clothing used by the lunatics. As some of these females became violent during Vear, I had to purchase a small quantity of the summer clothing from the Tezpi B r
Jail. Blankets and blanket kurtas were, as usual, purchased from the Bhagalpur Central Jail. Three blanke's are issued to the lunatics, as the climate here is very cold in the winter. All the old cane charpoys have been replaced by new wooden ones made in the Asylum, and they are now in good condition. 5. Hospital accommodation.It was mentioned in last year's report that the hospital building for male lunatics was not a very suitable one, and is not much used on this account. I regret that no steps have yet been taken to build a suitable one in its place. A house to accommodate 4 female patients has been sanctioned, and will be built during the year. 6. Water-supply.There is a well in the outside compound, from which a sufficient supply is always to be l:ad. The masonry filter attached to the well is in good working order, and is always kept clean. The water used is pure and abundant. 7. Conservancy.As in former years, the dry-earth system was in force, and the night-soil trenched in the asylum ground, this ground being cultivated, when ready for cultivation. 8. Admissions and discharges. The following table gives particulars of the admissions and discharges for the past two years, and the arverage of the preceding ten years : 1899. 1898.

In the case of male lunatics, the number has only fallen off from 22 to 16, the number of female lunatics remaining the same (6) in both years. There was not a single re-admission during the year. (b) Discharged cured and improved.It is satisfactory that during the year 1&deg; lunatics have been discharged as cured and improved, against 15 of the year before. (c) Escapes.One criminal lunatic, named Sandeswar Dass Rajbangsi, received from the Goalpara district, escaped from the Asylum at dusk on the night of the 18th October 1899. He was searched for, but no trace could be found of him. Informatics was duly sent to the police and the Deputy Commissioner of Goalpara, but no trace has yet been found of the man. The warder from whose custody he escaped naS been fl-ned.

It will appear that the cause of insanity was ascertained only in the case of 11 inmates out of 22 admitted. A more careful enquiry made by a responsible official would, I am sure, elicit the cause of the insanity in the majority of cases. 18. Sickness and mortality.See Statement No. VIII. Out of a total population of 14.7, 57 were admitted to hospital during the year, of whom 41 were males and 16 females. Of these, 38 were admitted once, 12 twice, 5 thrice, and 2 four limes. The percentages of admissions to hospital and deaths to average strength have been as follows: Year. Admissions. Deaths. Male. Female. Total. Male. Female.

The increase in the average number of persons attending the hospital is due to the heavy rains this year and the general unhealthness of the station.
The use of quinine, iron, and dilute sulphuric acid was, like the year before, continued during the unheakhy season of the year, i.e., from May to November.

It will be seen from the statement that the number of admissions into the hospital has much decreased since the practice of prophylactic treatment was introduced amongst the lunatics in 1897. 19. Total mortality.The total number of deaths was 9, or 7'11 per cent, of average strength, as compared with 5, or 4*03 per cent, in 1898. The deaths are classified as under: Dysentery Anaemia (due to ague) Cancer of the stomach Fhthisis Diarrhoea Total 2 4 1 1 1 9
8 The number of deaths during the year seems excessive, as compared with the 5 deaths last year; but of the 9, one death was from phthisis, one from cancer of the stomach, and one that of a woman who was received in a very bad state of health she never spoke while in the Asylum ; she persistently refused to eat, and had to be forcibly fed ; she suffered from Pica,* and was often found eating earth, pieces of brick, etc. As a result, she contracted dysentery and died after five months' residence in the Asylum. If these 3 cases of deaths, which were absolutely non-preventible, be deducted, there remain only 6 deaths out of a daily average of 126*47, against 5 last year out of a daily average of 123*98. The 4 deaths shown under anaemia should have been shown under malarial fever, as the cause of the anaemia in each case was malaria. 20.

Sanctioned establishment.In addition to those already entertained during the previous year, only one keeper, a female, was appointed in the month of December. Although there was provision in the budget for 3 female keepers, we could not procure 1 before December. 24. ManufacturesStatement No. XLThe net profit from the Manufacturing Department was Rs. 1,482-4, against Rs. 1,592-14-3 in the previous year, or Rs. 11 u-10-3 less, than last year, but last year there were only Rs. 4010 shown in column 6 of Statement No. XI under heading &quot; Value of manufactured goods in store at the end of the year, &quot; while this year we have Rs. 375. Paddy has decreased in price this year, so th*&raquo; value of paddy sold is less than what would have been received last year. On account of the abnormally heavy rains in May and June, our asu dhan was destroyed, and also 1 acre of castor-oil plants. The same cause damaged our bricks: 85,000 bricks were burnt in one kiln, which was damaged by heavy rain and wind, so that only 30,000 bricks were found to be good.

Out of this amount, Rs. 60-15-9 was realised from the relatives of two patients ; Rs. 22-2-7 was found on the person of two lunatics on admission, and the rest was realised from the managers of tea gardens for their coolies, who were under agreement under Act I of 1882, and were cured and returned to the garden after discharge from the Asylum. 25. Visits. During the year under report, the Asylum was visited twice by the Chief Commissioner and once by the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner Six meetings of the committee of visitors were held, and copies of their proceedings sent in all cases to the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner for transmission to the Local Government. 26. Amusements.As in last year, the lunatics were provided with books and papers, musical instruments, cards, and were periodically entertained with magic lantern exhibitions. Sweetmeats and fruits are distributed on festival days. Also selected patients were sent under proper escort to the race-course when races take place, and to the river ghat to see the vashan ceremony of Durga Puja. They are also allowed to go to the bazar now and then. This year we propose to purchase a gramophone for the lunatics with records of Bengali and Hindustani music. 27. General remarks.About an acre of land was planted with castor-oil seeds, but unfortunately all the plants were destroyed by the unusually heavy rains. Sixty good KaghaziXxme plants were planted this vear according to the suggestion of Color.el Carr-Calthrop, the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner of Assam, and we will try to increase the number this year. With reference to paragraph 20 of Notes by the Director General, Indian Medical Service, on Asylum Reports for 1898, I would point out that the sanctioned pay for larders is not such as to attract really suitable men. A warder gets Rs. 10 per Mensem, while the wages of the coolies working in the town amount to annas 6 per day, or roughly Rs. 12 per mensem. The work is also very hard ; the warders remain present day and night, and have only 4 hours off duty in 24. No dairy has been started as yet. Cattle-disease has been very prevalent for the 'ast three years in Tezpur, and a dairy, if commenced, would probably, on account of Mortality, not be a financial success. Second-grade Hospital Assistant Giris Chandra Das has, as usual, worked most satisfactorily during the year: he has great tact with patients, maintains authority an(l discipline efficiently, looks most carefully into every detail of management, and is &quot;tost attentive to the sick. I have recommended during the year that, as a reward for his excellent work, he may be promoted to the first grade before he finishes his seven ^ears in the second grade.

Resolution on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum Report for 1899. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the General Department^ No. 1407^., dated Shillong, the 19th April 1900. Read- Report on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year iSgg. RESOLUTION. The following statement gives statistics of the Asylum for the past two years: 1898. 1899. Remained on ist January ... Admitted and re-admitted ... Total ... ... Discharged, cured ,, improved ... 118 125 ... 29 22 ... 147 '47 ... 14 '5 ... I 3 2 ... 1 ... 5 9 ... 22 28 ... '25 119 ... 124 126 not improved Escaped Died Total Remaining on 31st December Daily average strength 2. Of the 22 admissions, 7 were criminals, and at the close of the year there were 37 criminal lunatics, compared with 36 at the close of the preceding year. This proportion of non-criminal to criminal population compares unfavourably with that of asylums in other Provinces, and in the Resolution on the Report for 1896, the attention of District Magistrates was directed to the standing orders which require that ordinarily only such non-criminal lunatics should be committed to asylums as are dangerous or in the acute stage of insanity. The Chief Commissioner is afraid that these instructions have been lost sight of, especially in the Lckhimpur and Darrang districts. About half of the inmates of the Asylum are supplied from the tea gardens in the Province, Statement No. VII in the Appendix gives details of the alleged causes of insanity among the patients. The causes were known in only 45 cases of the 125 inmates in the Asylum &deg;n the ist January 1899, and they were ascertained in 11 of the 22 cases admitted. For the whole of India, the proportion of known to unknown causes is about 9 to 10. 3. The percentage of admissions to hospital to average strength was 67*21, compared with 70*17 in 1898 and an average of 54*35 for the previous ten years. The Percentages of deaths to average strength for the same periods were 7*11, 4*03, and ,0&quot;52- The Chief Commissioner is satisfied that the Asylum is healthier than it was, and observes that, prior to the appointment of a Hospital Assistant in 1895, only serious cases of illness were admitted, a fact which accounts for the low percentage of admissions in former years. 4. The expenditure for the year amounted to Rs. 12,413, compared with SjJ' !3&gt;273 in 1898, and the cost per head was Rs. 95-13-10, against Rs. 104-12-11. the average cost per head in Lunatic Asylums throughout India in 1897 was ^s- J34 J ly, but it must be borne in mind that only natives of India are admitted to the T ezpur Asylum. The net profit from the manufacturing departmendecrease, vis., from Rs. 1,593 to Rs. 1,482. The patients showed a slight earned in addition ft!' l-'?^,0&quot;^'. including Rs. 727 for garden produce consume,! by themselves and s. 166 for clothing worn by the inmates.
5. The Asylum was visited twice during the year by the Chief Commissioner and once by the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner. The inspection remarks of the Principal Medical Officer precede the report. On the occasion of his first visit the Chief Commissioner desired that a plan of the Asylum grounds should be prepared : this was subsequently done, and it was ascertained that the total area extended over 55 acres. A new ward for females was added during the year, and the Chief Commissioner has recently sanctioned the construction of a godown to stock rations and supplies. A hospital for females is also a necessary requirement, but it should be a small building, and not built on the expensive scale of the women's ward which cost Rs. 8,500. Small isolated huts in which inmates of unclean habits can be segregated should also be provided. The Asylum was in charge of Lieutenant-Colonel Macnamara for the first three months of the year and of Major Hall during the remaining nine months. Both officers managed the Asylum to the Chief Commissioner's satisfaction. The Chief Commissioner is glad to notice the favourable remarks on the work of Babu Giris Chandra Das, Hospital Assistant, with which Major Hall concludes his report.

From No. 841. COLONEL C. W. CARR-CALTHROP, M.D., Ch.D., I.M.S., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner\ Assam, THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF ASSAM. To Shillong, the 2nd March 1901* Sir, I HAVE the honor to submit the Annual Report and Returns of the Lunatic Asylum, Tezpur, for the year 1900, and I beg to attach a copy of remarks which I recorded after my visit to the Asylum on October 31st, 1900. 2. This Report was due to you on February 1st, but as some of the statements had to be returned for correction, and as I did not myself get back from my last inspection tour in the Naga Hills and Manipur until February 23rd, the delay, though regrettable, was not to be avoided. 3. As my remarks foreshadowed, the death-rate has been very high, viz., 17, or 13:86 per cent., as against 9, or 7*11 per cent, last year, and the number of admissions into hospital rose from 85 in 1899 to 186 in 1900, or from a daily average of 5*84 to one of 11*45, that is, just about double. The increased sickness and mortality were due chiefly to diarrhoea and dysentery, but there was also a general increase all round. 4. One death was due to kald-dzdr, but no other cases of fevers of unusual kind were noted; 5 deaths were due to phthisis which could not be prevented, and in 5 cases and 2 cases, the mortality was due Lo diarrhoea and dysentery respectively. In fact, just one-half of the total sickness was due to these two diseases. The Superintendent notes that the past year was a generally unhealchy one, and that the unhealthi- jness of the Asylum was shared by the jail and the free population of the district and town of Tezpur, in which diarrhoea and dysentery were very prevalent during the whole of the summer, viz,, from May to November. I have no doubt that this explanation [is virtually the correct one. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, C. W. CARR-CALTHROP, M.D., Ch.D.t Colonel, /.M.S., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner', Assam&gt;

Carr-Calthrop, I.M.S., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, in the visitors* book of the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum, dated the $\st October 1900. This morning I visited the Tezpur Asylum, accompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel Macnamara, Superintendent, who has just lately returned from furlough. Major Hall in charge up to April 20th, Assistant Surgeon N. C. Bose from April 21st to June was 5th, Captain Leventon from June 6th to September 23rd, and Lieutenant-Colonel Macnamara since then ; there have thus been four changes during the year. 2. The new ward for women has, I think, justified its cost, and the small hospital for women which has been sanctioned and will shortly be constructed will, I feel sure, be of great use. Since my last visit a ration godown has been built; this was badly wanted. I am sorry to see the estimate has been exceeded ; this should not have been done, but we have got a building with kiln-burned bricks set in lime, i.e. {pucea), instead of one with ekra walls; the value of rat-proof walls is worth the extra money. One has only to look at the hole a female lunatic made a day or two ago in the wall of the new ward to consider whether all walls ought not to be made pucca for six feet high at least. A hospital for males is still required, and some means are really urgently requisite to separate filthy inmates from others, whether criminal or non-criminal. This will be provided for sooner or later, I doubt not. 3. The clothing and rations have been good during the whole year, but I regret to observe that the general look of the inmates is not good : they appear depressed and not nearly so healthy as at this time last year. The sickness and mortality rates have also risen considerably. There were 97 males and 28 females, total 125 lunatics, in confinement on the day of my visit, including two under observation, classified thus : Criminal Non-criminal Under observation Total Male. Female. Total 34 3 37 62 24 86 1 1 2 97 28 125 Up to date 22 males and 8 females have been admitted this year; their cases were of the usual types. 4. No less than 13 deaths have occurred, 11 males and 2 females having succumbed to various affections, as shown below: Phthisis ... ... Diarrhoea Dysentery ... Softening of the brain ..* General paralysis Sunstroke * Suicide (hanging) Male. Female. Total. 2 2 4 3 ... 3 2 ... 2 1 1 ... 1 ..&laquo; 1 mmmt ..

On the day of my visit I found as many as 25 sick ; and as the hut used as a hospital has only accommodation for 8 patients, the rest have to be treated in their barracks ; this is not desirable, but is inevitable until funds become available for the construction of a proper hospital. The diseases from which the sick were suffering were Phthisis Anaemia Epilepsy ocroiuLct mi 1#&laquo; Dyspepsia Dysentery Diarrhoea Ague Wound (suicidal) ... Syphilis General debility Male. Female. Total 1 1 2 4 4 8 1 1 1 ... 1 1 1 1 1 4 ... 4 4 ... 4 1 ... 1 1 1 1 1 Total 18 25 Three of these, vis., the two cases of phthisis and 1 of diarrhoea, are very bad and will probably die before the end of the year. The daily rate of sick up to date is said to have been 11*17 ; if so, the general health has not only been bad, but is getting worse, and I can only trust that Lieutenant-Colonel Macnamara will be able to improve it. 7. The lunatic who escaped in 1899 has not been secured; and this year one criminal and two non-criminal lunatics have also absconded and not been found to date. 8. A crop of cantor-seed was again sown, but the plants did not do well and were a failure. It appears that the red earth, of which the garden is composed, is not suitable, and the experiment need not be continued ; but I hear that planters in the neighbourhood are growing castor-seed for the sake of the manure the cake affords, and, if this is true, it would be well to get a common country oil press to afford occupation to some of the more robust of the men. 9. The Kaghazi lime trees are doing well and more might be got, as there is a practically unlimited demand for both the fruit and juice. 10. Hospital Assistant Giris Chandra Das has been in subordinate charge during the whole year, and I am glad to see that he has passed his examination for promotion to the first grade with great credit; and I trust he will be as careful as possible in dealing with the people under his charge. He has always done well before, and I only wish^ to emphasise the fact which the details given above clearly indicate, namely, that the vital condition of the lunatics here confined is not satisfactory, and that there is cause for anxiety. 11. The establishment as sanctioned is not complete : there are vacancies for two female warders on Rs. 10 and one sweeper on Rs. 10, but no people can be got to take up the work. Reference has been made to Berhampur (Murshidabad), but up to the present the Superintendent has not been able to fill the posts. This is very provoking, but I hope the difficulty may be shortly overcome. Te*urt C. W. CARR-CALTHROP, M.D., Ch.D., Colonel, I.M.S., The $\st October 1900.

rotal. 2 5 4 8 i 6 i 2 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE TEZPUR LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 9 1900, used as in their for the suffering 1. Asylum charge.The Asylum was during the year in charge of the following Superintendents for the periods noted against their names: Major E. A. W. Hall, i.m.S., from the 1st of January to 20th April, Assistant Surgeon Narayan Chandra Basu from the 21st April to 5th June, Captain Asher Leventon from the 6th June to 23rd September. I took over charge from him on my return from furlough on the 24th September and was in its charge to the end of the year. Second-grade Hospital Assistant Girish Chandra Das was in subordinate charge of the Asylum for the whole year, 2. Buildings, etc.(a) The Asylum buildings were kept neat, clean, and in good repair. (b) A godown with a two feet high plinth, brick walls, cemented floor, and iron-roof I has been added to the already existing buildings of the Asylum, at a cost of about Rs. 1,300, including the price of the bricks used, which were manufactured at the Asylum by the patients. (c) The drainage of the Asylum is excellent. No change was made, as there is I little to be desired. 3. Accommodation.There is accommodation for only 90 males and 30 females, land consequent on the increase in the number of patients it is scarcely sufficient. On one occasion there were 99 males and 28 females under treatment. Overcrowding was therefore unavoidable. Patients of violent and dirty habits had to be kept in the same compartment with comparatively cleanlier ones for want of separate accommodation.-This practice, however objectionable, will have to be resorted to occasionally until such jtime as additional accommodation for at least 15 persons is made. 4. Clothing and bedding.The female patients made the greater portion of the Isummer clothing used by the lunatics. As usual, blankets and blanket kurtas were [purchased from the Bhagalpur Jail. Three blankets are given to each lunatic. Owing [to the illness of three female lunatics who were employed weaving cloth, our Asylum [manufactured cloth was insufficient, therefore we had to purchase about 150 pieces of Jcloth for dhnties from the Tezpur Jail this year* 5. Hospital accommodation.A small hospital building for the accommodation of jfour female patients was in course of construction towards the close of the year. It is iln&deg;w nearly finished and will be occupied soon, thus removing a long-felt want. The hospital building for male patients was quite unsuitable for its purpose. The IHon'ble the Chief Commissioner, on the occasion of his last visit here, directed me to Fbmit an estimate for a new male hospital, and I have accordingly asked the Executive l^ngineer to prepare a plan and estimate which is now under consideration. This hospital is intended to accommodate 12 patients, and will, to some extent, remove the tendency jo overcrowding, for our present hospital is insufficient for 8 patients, and moreover pntains no isolation ward. Indeed, I have reason to believe that phthisis has been IPread in the present hospital from patient to patient. 6. Water-supply.The supply of water is good and abundant. The masonry well Peeas repairs. The filtering tank attached to it is in good working order. There was 0 difficulty about the supply of water, but it is drawn with a rope. Some day I hope &deg;et sanction for a lift pump such as is now in use at the Tezpur Jail. 7&laquo; Conservancy.The dry-earth system was in force and the night-soil was trenched I the Asylum grounds. The lunatics seldom use the latrine, and as we emyloy no ylents as sweepers, we feel the want of an extra sweeper. At present we have s male 0 * female sweepers. tat. 2 8 I I I I 4 4 1 1 1 { bad and 3 general eutenant- year one 'found to and were t suitable, bourhood s is true, ie of the iere is a ie during Dromotion in dealing wish to the vital cause fc&gt;r j for two ot to take p to the Drovoking, i.D., /.M.S., er, Assart-
2 8. Admissions and discharges.The average lunatic population of the year was 122, against 126 in the previous year, and an average of 111 during the ten years from 188 to 1898 (a) Admissions.The number of admissions during the year was 30, against 22 in the previous year, exclusive of 1 re-admission in 1900, against none in 1899. In the case of male lunatics the increase in admissions was 7, and in that of females 2, including 1 re-admission. (b) Discharges.During the year under review, 16 patients were discharged as cured and improved, against 18 in the preceding year. (c) Escapes.One criminal lunatic named Lai Das Fakir received from Lakhim-pur and two non-criminal lunatics, viz., Sarada from Lakhimpur and Lucas Munda from Addabari tea estate, Darrang, escaped through the bamboo palisading. Information was on each occasion given to the Police and the Magistrate as soon as the escapes were discovered, and search was made by the Asylum servants but to no effect, as all three are still at large. The bamboo palisading is not safe, and is at the same time expensive, costing more than Rs. 500 a year to maintain it in good repair. As long as we have a palisade only, we must expect escapes. My belief is that it would be better to have a good hedge instead of the palisade and spend the Rs. 500 on keepers. This arrangement would give us four more keepers, and the place would look better and seem much less like a prison. (d) Admissions classified.The following statement shows the districts from which the lunatics were received during the year. Lunatics from the Surma Valley are sent to the Asylum at Dacca : District. Criminal. Non.criminal. Total. Male. Female. Total. Male. Female. Total. Male. Female. Total. 1 t ' 1 ' 5 6 7 8 9 10 Darrang Nowgong Kamrup Lakhimpur ... ... Sibsagar Khasi and Jaintia Hills ...

The largest number of lunatics from any one district was 11, received from the district of Darrang, Sibsagar comes second with 7, and Lakhimpur third with 6. I do not suppose there is any greater liability to insanity in Darrang than elsewhere, but there is probably less hesitation in sending patients to the Asylum when it is near at hand. 9.

The increase in the average number of persons admitted into be hospital was due to the general unhealthiness of the town. . The administration of quinine, iron, and dilute sulphuric acid was continued Uring the unhealthy season of the year, i.e., from May to November, as in the Jjcetijpg year. Sickness increased in these months. Whether prophylactic treatment , mtle good, or but for this treatment sickness possibly would have been greater, ere 18 no means of knowing.
17. Total mortality.The total number of deaths was 17, or 13*86 per cent, of average strength, as compared with 9, or 7*11 per cent, of 1899. The deaths are classified as under : Dysentery ... Kala-azar ... Softening of the brain Apoplexy ... General paralysis Phthisis Diarrhoea Suicide by hanging Total 2 1 1 1 1 5 5 1 ... 17 The number of deaths during the year is high, as compared with that of the average of the last 5 years. In 1894 it was as high as 28. The numbers for 1891 and 1893 were 18 and 15, respectively. Owing to the general unhealthiness of the year, sickness from diarrhoea and dysentery was excessively high, and these diseases were mostly prevalent from May to November. The unhealthiness of the Asylum was shared by the jail and by the population of the district and town of Tezpur. 18.

Sanctioned establishment.The establishment remained the same as it was in the previous year. The post of one female-keeper remained vacant for some months of the year, as female-keepers are not always available. The post is still vacant. The number of sweepers is small, and one should be added to the number already entertained. 22. Manufactures.Statement No. XI.The net profit from the Manufacturing Department was Rs. 1,416-15-3, against Rs. 1,482-4-0 in the previous year, a falling-off of Rs. 65-4-9. Out of Rs. 116, which were received from paying patients, Rs. 45-14 were realised from the relatives of four patients, Rs. 15-10-9 were found on the person of one lunatic on admission, and Rs. 54-7-3 were realised from the managers of the tea gardens for the maintenance of coolies, who were under agreement under Act I of 1882, and were cured and returned to the gardens after recovery. 23. Vis-its.During the year under report, the Asylum was visited twice by the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner, once by the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner of Assam, twice by the Chief Engineer, and once by the Commissioner of the Assam Valley Districts. Six meetings of the committee of visitors were held, and copies of their proceedings sent in all cases to the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner for transmission to the Local Government. 24. Amusement.As in last year, the lunatics were provided with books and papers, musical instruments, cards, etc., and were periodically entertained with magic lantern exhibitions. Sweetmeats and fruits were distributed on festival days. Selected patients were sent under proper escort to the race-course when races took place and to the river ghat to see the vashan ceremony during the Durga Puja holidays. A Gramophone with records of English and Hindustani music was purchased for the entertainment of the lunatics during the year. 25. General remarks.A second attempt was made during the year to grow castor-oil seed, but the plants all died off in the rains. The Asylum soil is apparently not suitable. It is rich enough, but it is clayey, while castor require a loose soil to let moisture through. We have had the same experience in planting potatoes. Since the Principal Medical Officer's suggestion to try castor-oil seeds, we made two attempts in view of the greatly increased value of the cake as a manure for tea bushes and the ready sale for the cake which was practically unsaleable before. A hundred Kaghazi lime plants were put out during the year to enable us to raise our own limes for pickling. Of the 60 plants put out in 1899, 20 died. This year's plants are doing well. A nursery of betel-nut palms promises well. These trees should hereafter save us Rs. 35 a year, and are ornamental as well as useful. Owing to scanty rainfall, we had only a 4-anna crop of paddy, which was a disappointment, and our vegetable garden this cold season is not doing well. On the other hand, 5 acres of sugarcane realised Rs. 430-9, besides Rs. 114-6 worth consumed by the Asylum inmates. There should be a dhobie entertained, as many of the patients can't wash their own clothes. The high mortality is the most painful feature in the year's working. Putting aside the case of a man who hanged himself with a bit of cane at night, there were '6 deaths out of an average population of i2&quot;57 or over 12 per cent. All the jjeaths occurred between June and December. There was no death before 7th June, bl,t _ between that date and 14th September, there were 9 deaths including the case of suicide. I foretold a heavy death list when I resumed charge, as we had several
8 hopeless cases when the Principal Medical Officer inspected in October. I attribute the heavy death-rate to an unhealthy year, as proved by the district figures, but of course there is a considerable element of chance in the case of an Asylum with a small population. Having been in charge only three months of the year, I am not in a position to make any positive statements as to the exceptional mortality, but I am sure it was not due to any avoidable cause, for Hospital Assistant Girish Chandra Das was unremitting in his attention to every detail connected with the welfare of the Asylum inmates. He has, moreover, during the year passed the examination held at Dibrugarh for promotion to the first grade, and I understand his answering at that examination was so good as to merit the special commendation of the examiners.

SHILLONG Printed and published by ContnghAm Frakcis, Press Superintendent, Assam, at the Secretariat Printing Office(Judl.) No. 52716516-4-1901,
Resolution on the Report on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1900. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the General Department, No. 1444.7., dated Shillong, the nth April 1901. Read-Report on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the year 1900. RESOLUTION. The most important feature of the year's administration is the excessive mortality of the inmates of the Asylum, of which no satisfactory explanation has been furnished. There were 17 deaths during the year. The Chief Commissioner has no sufficient reason for thinking that the year was an unusually unhealthy one either in the Darrang district or in the town of Tezpur. The death-rate in this Asylum has always been very heavy, and though there has been some improvement in late years, the mortality during the past year, high as it is, is less than it was in 1891, and only two more than it was in 1^93, when the total number of lunatics was somewhat smaller. In 1894 there were no less than 28 deaths. The unhealthiness of the Asylum during 1900 is, however, the more marked when it is remembered that the mortality in the Assam jails taken together has been reduced during the year to only 24 per thousand. Having regard to the character c f the inmates, the death-rate in the Asylum can never be assimilated to that in jails, but it is certainly capable of very material reduction, and Mr, Cotton is disposed to think that if improved accommodation were afforded, there would be a marked tendency in this direction. This has always struck the Chief Commissioner as the weak point of the Asylum, and although something has been done especially by the construction of a new female ward, it is no doubt very necessary to build new male wards also, and he will endeavour, if possible, to allot funds for the purpose. By order of the Chief Commk^oner of Assam, F. J. MONAHAN, Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam. A&gt; S. P. 0. (Judl.) No. 175-17515-4-1900.

Out of the total 30 deaths, 8 died of phthisis, 5 of diarrhoea, 5 of dysentery, 4 of kdld-dzdr, 1 of softening of the brain, 1 of apoplexy, 1 of general paralysis, 1 of anaemia, 1 of malarial fever, 1 of chorea, 1 suicide by hanging, and 1 patient was murdered by another lunatic. Out of the 8 patients who died in 1902, one had been in confinement for 25 years, one for 4, and one for 3 years : the others were more recently admitted. 13. Prophylactic medicines were issued, as in former years, during the unhealthy season, vis., from May to November, and all the lunatics were treated except some violent ones, who refused to take medicine. 14. Expenditure and cost per inmate.The total expenditure during the triennium under review was Rs. 42,160-10-5, against Rs. 37,287-3-6 during the previous triennium, and the average cost per inmate was Rs. 109-9-8, against Rs. 101-7-n during the previous three years. The excess was mainly due to the dearness of food-grains. 15. Employment of inmates.The male patients who were quiet were employed in gardening, cooking, repairing houses, cultivating, brick-moulding, etc., and the females in spinning, weaving, surki-grinding, and paddy-husking. 16. Accommodation^ and sanitary and hospital arrangements.The accommodation for male patients is bad and insufficient, 126 males being confined in buildings intended for 90 only. A separate and special report on the necessity of providing more accommodation for males generally, and increasing the number of isolation cells for violent cases, has been submitted for orders. Overcrowding, however, has been to some extent relieved by converting the male workshop into a sleeping barrack and erecting bamboo side walls and bamboo machans. 17. The sanitary arrangements of the Asylum are good. The drinking-water 1 drawn from a pucca well outside the stockade. The water was examined by Chemical Examiner, and reported to be good. 18. The number of sweepers was at times insufficient, but one additional sweep was appointed in November last, and the staff now suffices for present requirements. 19. The hospital arrangements for males are very poor, but a pucca hospita been sanctioned at a cost of Rs. 8,ooo, and is now under construction. An exce hospital for females was erected in 1901 at a cost of Rs. 569.
20. Inspection.During the triennium, the Asylum was inspected thrice by the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner of Assam, once by the Commissioner, Assam Valley Districts, and three times by the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam. Twenty meetings of the Committee of visitors were held during the last three years. 21. General remarks.Hardworking and well-behaved lunatics were rewarded with extra diet, and other indulgences such as pan, tobacco, etc., but the result is not altogether satisfactory. Some, it is true, appreciate favours of the kind given for good work, but the system leads to jealousy and quarrelling. 22. Hospital Assistant Babu Girish Chandra Das, who was in subordinate medical charge during the entire period, acquitted himself very creditably and has maintained the high reputation he enjoys in the Subordinate Medical Department. He has been rewarded by promotion, with the sanction of the Government of India, to the first grade after 14 instead of 15 years' service. C. W. CARR-CALTHROP, M.D., Ch.D., Colonel\ I. M.

Resolution on the Triennial Report on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the years 1900, 1901, and 1902. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the General Department', No. 1999 J., dated Shillo7ig, the 6th May 1903. Read- Triennial Report on the Tezpur Lunatic Asylum for the years 1900, 1901, and 1902, RESOLUTION. There was a marked increase in the number of admissions into the Asylum during the three years as compared with the previous triennium, the annual number of admissions, which had fallen considerably during 1897, 1898, and 1899, having again risen to the normal of previous years. On the other hand, discharges from, and deaths in, the Asylum were fewer than in previous years, with the result that the daily average strength of inmates, which in 1899 was 126*47, reached in 1902 the high total of 142*76, and the number of lunatics confined rose from 119 on the 1st January 1900 to 154 on the 31st December 1902. The mortality was excessive in 1900, when 17 deaths occurred, but there was considerable improvement in 1901 and 1902, the deaths having been only 5 and 8 respectively. The daily average of sick was not so satisfactory, and was considerably in excess of that of previous years. This may have been due in some degree to the insufficient accommodation provided for the male patients. The present buildings are intended for the accommodation of 90 male patients, but the daily average strength of inmates was greatly in excess of this number, and on the 31st December 1902 126 male lunatics were confined in the Asylum. The question of providing further accommodatiDn is under the consideration of the Chief Commissioner. At the same time, the Magistrates should bear in mind the desirability of making over harmless lunatics, particularly of the non-criminal class, to the care of their friends and relations. During the past two years noJ lunatic was discharged in this way, although the number of non-criminal lunatics confined increased from 80 to 101. No satisfactory explanation has been given of the increase in the average annual cost per inmate from Rs. 101-7-11 to Rs. 109-9-8. It is stated that the excess was mainly due to the dearness of food-grains, but the average price of common rice in Tezpur, according to the price current returns, was actually less than the average of the previous three yeari. The Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner will be asked to submit a further explanation on this point. By order of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, F. J. MONAHAN, Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam, A. S. P, O. (J.tdl.) No. 86-1.'87-.1-IJ03.

Of the total admissions, 16 sftement&deg;No I were receive^ from Lakhimpur district, 8 from Sibsagar, 5 from Darrang, 3 from Kamrup, 3 from Nowgong, 2 from the Khasi and Jaintia Hills, and 1 from Goalpara. 2. The total number of patients discharged was 14, against 14 in the previous year. Thirteen were cured and one was made over to his friends Discharges. j . . b in an improved state. 3. One male patient escaped from the asylum during the year, and is still at large. Escapes. &deg; 4. There was accommodation for 90 males, but an average of 132*02 male patients was present daily. Though the male workshop was con-Accommodation, verted into a sleeping barrack, there was overcrowding to a certain extent. A new male ward is under construction and will probably be completed before March 1905. If four such buildings be built, as is proposed, then there will be ample room for male patients. A group of 4 solitary cells is also under construction. 5. There were 11 admissions of criminal lunatics during the year under report, Criminal lunatics. Statement No. II. against 9 in the previous year. 6. Out of a total of 38 admissions, the cause of insanity was known only in n, 2 being due to ganj'a-smokmg, 1 to opium-eating, 1 to spirit-Statement No^VU drinking, 2 to epilepsy, and 5 to moral causes such as wife's misconduct, family troubles, death of child, loss of money, etc. 7. Of the 195 lunatics treated during the year, 15, or 7*69 per cent., died, whilst 128 were admitted to the hospital during the same period, SlCs&quot;atemendt NcTflty' '^e daily average number of sick being 16*36, against 11*22 of the previous year. This increase was, in Colonel Mac-namara's opinion, due partly to overcrowding and partly to the general unheahhiness of the town as compared with former years. Of the 15 deaths, one was due to an accident, 4 to dysentery, 4 to anaemia, 2 to diarrhoea, 2 to kald-dsdr, and 1 each to remittent fever and pneumonia. 8. After deducting Rs. 212-1-3 received from paying patients, the actual expendi- ture was Rs. 16,114-7-7 during the year under report, of ^^l^^t^r^' whIch Rs- .7.426-9, or Rs. 45-15.11 per head, was spent for diet of patients, against Rs. 7,350, or Rs. 47-4-6 per head of the previous year. A sum of Rs. 1,499-12 was spent for contingencies, against Rs. 1,390-12-9 in the previous year. This excess was incurred mainly for the manufacture of bricks for sale or asylum use. The asylum yielded a net profit of Rs. 2,682-12-3 in the year under report, against Rs. 2,103-6 in the previous year. This increase was due StafemeutNTx. to tne manufacture of bricks and the value of labour supplied to the Public Works Department for work done in the asylum.
