TABLE OF CONTENTS. PAGE Report on the working of the Micro-Biological section by Dr. F. M. Gibson, M.B., B.Sc., Director i Appendix IREPORT ON THE WORK CARRIED OUT IN THE MICRO-BIOLOGICAL SECTION OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, GUINDY, FOR THE YEAR 1912. There was but little change in the staff of the section this year. Captain W. S. Patton, I.M.S., was in charge of the Institute as Acting Director from the 1st till the 14th January. Dr. F. M. Gibson re-assumed charge of the Office of Director on the 15th of January and remained in charge during the year. Instead of reverting to his substantive appointment of Assistant Director, Captain Patton was posted to do special work on the investigation of Kala Azar. For the time being he ceased to be on the staff. Captain F. W. Cragg, I.M.S., acted as Assistant Director, sub.pro tem., through- out the year. A very large amount of work was carried out in the section. Captain Cragg continued his entomological researches, studying especially the morphology and mechanism of the mouth apparatus in blood-sucking flies, the nature of the digestive process in blood-feeders, and the life histories and bionomics of the dipterous fauna of the neighbourhood. His results cannot be given here, as from their nature they do not lend themselves to abstraction, and would be incomplete without the numerous original figures which accompany the text. They are published in the scientific memoirs series by the officers of Medical and Sanitary Department of the Government of India, Nos. 53, 54, 58 and 59, in other numbers of the same series now in the press, and in the Journal of Indian Research. A book embodying the work done by him in conjunction with Captain Patton is now in the press. At the instance of Lieut.-Colonel Elliot, I.M.S., Captain Cragg also prepared a number of microscopic sections of the entire eye-ball showing the pathological changes in eyes after the Indian operation of "couching" the lens for cataract. The systematic examination of the water-supplies, actual and prospective, of the Presidency was continued on the same lines as last year. There was a considerable rise in the number of bacteriological examinations carried out, and a slight fall in the number of chemical examinations. As in previous years these results are printed in the form of appendices to this report. The results got with jail waters forming Appendix III, Parts 1 and 2, and those got with municipal water-supplies Appendix IV, Parts 1, 2, 3 and 4. There has been a considerable drop in the number of specimens sent for exami- nation, the fall amounting to rather over 14 per cent. It would be a mistake however to infer that this branch of the work has necessarily decreased. As a matter of fact the fall has taken place in those classes of specimens requiring but little work, and there have been large increases in specimens requiring elaborate testing, e.g., specimens for the highly elaborate Wassermann test have increased from 11 to 481; Bacteriological analysis of water from 529 to 620; and specimens for Spirochaeta from 7 to 55. Notable falls are seen under the headings, plague in animals, in men and under blood for Widal's test. Table I is arranged to show the nature of the material sent, the examination required, the result, positive or negative, and the number of each kind.

Farther experiments of a comparative nature will be carried out with varied preparations of antigen. Given that it is possible to prepare a stable antigen from congenital syphilitic livers, the method as originally described by Wassermann will probably prove to give the most reliable results in all classes of cases. The effects on the Wassermann reaction caused by treatment with Salvarsan have also been studied, but the results are conflicting and no conclusion could be come to, except that diminution, if any, does not take place in less than two months. If the Wassermann test really has to do with syphilitic anti-toxin produced in the patient's system, it does not seem clear why treatment with Salvarsan should reduce it, nor; in relation to the endurance of the patient's immunity, desirable that it should do so. Of course if Salvarsan really kills off all the toxin, no farther anti-toxin can be produced, and a gradual reduction of the latter must take place; but the slower this excretion of immunising substance goes on, the better.

Notes of fTABLE IITABLE IIvii The results are remarkably different this year from those shown in the two preceding years. The number sent for examination was slightly lower, 7 per cent., but the percentage showing the organism fell from 25 per cent. to 7.3 per cent. During the two previous years the longest consecutive run of negative cases was nine. This year there were runs of 29 and 14 consecutive negative cases. The source of the material and the technique of the examination were the same in all three years, so it seems necessary to look for an explanation of the change in results elsewhere. It has been suggested that the method of transmission to the laboratory might be the cause. Previous to February 1912, the specimens were placed in formaline as soon after the extrusion of the fviii The large amount of highly technical work which has been accomplished in addition to the already large volume of simpler routine work speaks well for the energy and devotion to duty of the staff.

ix APPENDIX. I. THE SERUM DIAGNOSIS OF SYPHILIS AS CONDUCTED IN 481 CASES DURING THE YEARS 1911 AND 1912 INCLUDING A BRIEF COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE DIFFERENT MODIFICATIONS OF THE ORIGINAL WASSERMANN TEST AND THE EFFECT OF SALVARSAN TREATMENT ON THE RE- ACTION. By Civil Assistant Surgeon T. Sitapati Iyer, L.M. & S. On perusing an article by Captain Stevenson, I.M.S., in the report of the Bombay Bacteriolo- gical Laboratory for the year 1910, written on the Hecht-Fleming modification of the Wassermann test, as adopted by him with some variations, I was struck with the simplicity of the method and the reliability of the test claimed by the authors. I began testing a few bloods by this method but before long found it was not giving satisfactory results in my hands. Thereupon, on the sug- gestion of the Director, I took up the original Wassermann which was a little more complicated but did give fairly satisfactory results. This method also had its own difficulties which I will discuss later on but, on the whole, was of very satisfactory diagnostic value to the clinician. Lastly I attempted Levaditi's modification and conducted a series of parallel experiments to arrive at a comparison between the original method and it. I have also appended a table (table VII) containing the results of the examination of different bloods by the different methods with a brief history of the cases and the effect of Salvarsan on the reaction. Although it may be redundant to discuss in detail the different methods fully described by their authors and others in different works on bacteriology, still a brief description of the various methods and the technique adopted in doing them may be essential in making this paper intelligible. Two testsx take place. Bordet-Gengou observed that a mixture of any antigen and antibody when comxi (2) Normal saline extract of syphilitic liver.TABLE Ixiii A control experiment with a nonsyphilitic blood may be necessary in case only one blood is examined at a time. When several bloods are examined at the same time only one set of the controls 6 and 7 for all may be used and there may not be the necessity of doing a control with a nonsyphilitic serum, as any one of the bloods examined may give a nonsyphilitic reaction. At the end of the second incubation the tubes are kept in ice over night to allow the corpuscles not lysed to settle and then the result is read and recorded. There are many difficulties in carrying out this method efficiently and with constant success:xiv TABLE II. xv This method was adopted by the authors and a few others who have done parallel tests comparing it with the original Wassermann. They state that the test gave highly reliable results in their hands. The advantages they claim for this method are (1) the simplicity of the technique which renders the test accessible to the general practitioner who is without laboratory facilities. (2) It requires a very small amount of blood from a patient. The method has not given at all satisfactory results in my hands. The defects of the method which were admitted by the authors to be present in about 10 per cent. of cases such as (1) deficiency of the natural hæmolytic power of human serum for sheep's corpuscles and (2) deficiency and easy deterioration of complement naturally present in the serum, seem to be intensified in this country. This is probably due to the higher temperature of the country and a natural deficiency of Indian blood in there constituents. These factors should be investigated. In a large percent- age of cases the control test for the presence of complement and immune body in the serum does not answer at all. The remedies suggested by the authors of (1) doing the test again with fresh blood serum drawn on another occasion from the patient and (2) supplying the deficiency by adding one volume of inactivated normal human serum which is known to be lytic for sheep's corpuscles, have not effectively cured the defect in my cases. On the other hand the advantages claimed are not of very great weight. 2 to 3 c.c. of blood can be very easily taken from a finger as pointed out above and blood can be taken to the extent of 30 to 40 c c. from a rabbit's heart without hurting the animal in the least, as is the usual way adopted in this laboratory. Further, a definite and conclusive result from a laboratory will be more acceptable to both patient and physician than a vague indefinite result. For a critical study of the comparative merits of the three methods, I have not sufficient material available. A series of parallel experiments on the lines of each method should have been done simultaneously with the same serum and the results compared. The different methods adopted in the examination of the sera in this laboratory were more an outcome of necessity than a piece of research. The Hecht-Fleming method gave indefinite results in about 37 per cent. of bloods and in consequence was replaced by the original Wassermann. After a time our stock of the principal reagent, extract of syphilitic liver, was exhausted and no fresh material was available for a long time. The delay was keenly felt and caused great inconvenience and this induced me to try Levaditi's modification, the materials for which were available at all times. Thus methods were adopted in succession and the bloods examined by each were different and gave no comparative indication regarding the value of each method in specific cases. However at each time of passing from one method to another a few specimens were examined by the two methods in question at the time. Although the information available under these heads is very meagre, it indicates the necessity for a separate research on the subject. I therefore append in two small tables the results of such comparative examination. Seventy-eight bloods were examined by the Hecht-Fleming method with 29.5 per cent. positive, 33.3 per cent. negative, and 37.2 per cent. indefinite results. The 37 per cent. of indefi- nite results renders the method very unsatisfactory. In as far as the positive results were con- cerned, the method was reliable and consistent with the clinical diagnoses. In all three modifica- tions a negative reaction does not necessarily exclude syphilis. By the original method a larger number of bloods, 292 in number, were examined with 64 per cent. giving positive results, 35.6 per cent. negative and 0.4 per cent. indefinite results. The indefinite results were practically negligible. One hundred and eleven bloods were examined by Levaditi's modification with 42.3 per cent. positive and 57.7 per cent. negative results. This test gave no indefinite results. TABLE III. Number. Number of the case. Name. Hecht-Fleming method. Original method. 1 71 Pte. M. Poonamalle Indefinite Negative. 2 72 Do. Negative Do. 3 73 Pte.

The above table gives the analysis of eight bloods examined by the Hecht-Fleming and the original methods at the same time. Of these, six bloods gave an indefinite result with the former while all of them gave a definite result with the latter; three of these definite results were positive, so three out of eight, i.e., 37.5 per cent. of positive reactions were missed by the Hecht-Fleming method.

This table gives an analysis of 20 bloods examined by two methods, Levaditi's and original. The results agree in most of them. In two cases in which a negative result was obtained by Levaditi's method a positive (trace) reaction was got by the original method. Both these cases were of early infection, one having a phagadænic sore and the other rupial ulcers. These cases of primary syphilis or commencing infection seem to he missed by Levaditi's method. Though these results are too few in numbers to justify a decision, still I am of opinion that further experi- ments will prove the superiority of the original method over all others especially in diagnosing very early cases of syphilis.

xviii From this table it is clear that Salvarsan injection, although it seems to have a marvellous effect on the clinical symptoms in a short time, does not influence the Wassermann reaction for a long time to come. It takes at least two months to effect the degree of the reaction to an appreciable extent. The effect of Salvarsan on the serum reaction cannot therefore be studied in hospital cases, who cannot remain as in-patients for a long time. The reaction seems to persist to almost the same degree as before injection for at least a month. Most of the bloods sent were tested one month after the injection. In four cases bloods sent were tested from 6 to 8 weeks after the injection and in these a small change was observed. It is therefore probably necessary to examine the blood after 2 to 3 months or even longer to find out the effect of Salvarsan on the reaction. As was the case with different observers, I also was able to obtain occasionally a positive reaction from cases of leprosy and yaws. CONCLUSIONS. 1. The serum reaction for syphilis possesses a sufficient degree of specificity to make it of considerable value from a diagnostic and therapeutic point of view. 2. The Hecht-Fleming method has a greatly simplified technique but is of less diagnostic value especially under Indian conditions. 3. The Original Wassermann test is handicapped in that it depends on a material not always available, but it is a very sensitive one capable of showing the reaction in very early cases which were missed by the other methods. 4. Levaditi's modification is probably the most generally applicable. Its sensitiveness is not much inferior to the Original though it is apt to miss 10 per cent. of very early infections. The completeness with which the reaction takes place renders it very valuable. It also avoids many mistakes due to the sudden deterioration of the reagents used in the original method. 5. In primary syphilis, if the test is negative, it should be repeated after an interval as the reaction may be slow in developing. In secondary or tertiary syphilis the reaction is very definite unless intensive mercurial treatment has been employed where it may be very variable or even negative. 6. The effect of Salvarsan on the Wassermann reaction is not appreciably noticeable within 6 to 8 weeks of the injection. [Statement.

As will be seen from this table, the results of autogenous vaccine treatment could not be followed in a large number of cases as the patients were either lost sight of by the medical men in whose charge they had been, or else, for various reasons, the treatment was not given a reasonable trial. In some few cases of an extremely acute type the vaccines could not be got ready in time to be of any avail. In order to trace the history of as many cases as possible in future, a system of sending case cards with each despatch of vaccine, is being devised. These cards will be filled in by the medical men in charge of the cases and will then be returned to the Institute. In table II is shown the number and nature of the autogenous vaccines manufactured during the year with the results obtained from their use. It will be seen from this table that a large variety of diseased conditions was treated with vaccines. A few observations on some of these cases grouped under the different classes of diseases, will be of some interest. They will give us an idea not only of the bacteriology of several diseased conditions, both medical and surgical and affecting different parts of the body, but also what results may be expected from the application of vaccine therapy to such conditions. Furunculosis is the most common complaint treated with autogenous as well as with stock staphylococcus vaccines and is the condition in which the percentage of cures brought about is the highest. The staphylococcus aureus was almost invariably the organism isolated. Of the 36 cases for whom autogenous vaccines were made, the results of treatment in 20 were not reported. Of the remaining 16, 10 were cured, 4 improved and 2 were not benefited. Most of the unreported cases were out-patients of the different hospitals whose progress it was naturally difficult to follow. There is however little doubt that most of these were cured after one or two injections and the patients did not therefore attend for subsequent inoculations. A polyvalent antistaphylococcic vaccine was prepared during the year from over 80 different strains and is being issued as a stock vaccine. Eczema and Pemphigus.xlvi contents became converted into a material having the consistency of hard. cheese. The individual bullæ varied in size from that of a two-anna piece to a rupee or even larger. They involved chiefly the face, round the eyes and mouth and disfigured the features beyond recognition. There was also a number of similar bullæ on the fore-arms and hands. All these patches were very painful and tender and the skin immediately surrounding them was inflamed, red and angry-looking. A dose of stock pemphigus streptococcus vaccine, l million, was given and within 24 hours a marked improvement in the condition was noticeable. Cultures made from the eruption gave an almost pure growth of what looked at first like a diplococcus, but proved during sub-cultivation to be a streptococcus brevis not unlike that isolated from the ordinary cases of streptococcal pemphigus. Treatment with the autogenous vaccine accelerated the recovery and after four injections the patient was completely cured of the severe skin affection, which otherwise would probably have terminated fatally. This case is of peculiar interest in that it not only proved the causal relationship between the disease and the organism isolated from it, but it established as well the practical identity of the organisms isolated from different cases of varying degrees of virulence, as shown by the immediate relief afforded by the initial dose of stock vaccine. Case 21 was a peculiar staphylococcic infection of the mucous membrane of the alæ and septum of the nose of about 4½ years' duration associated with a hypertrophic inflammation of the inferior turbinated bones. Medication, cauterization, etc., were tried, but to no effect. Successive crops of tiny pustules formed, burst, and left small punched out ulcers with red bases, sometimes causing epistaxis. A series of injections with the antogenous staphylococcus aureus vaccine caused a decided improvement in the condition but not a cure. Acne.xlvii undoubtedly due to vaccine treatment. The following case is also interesting being one of the subacute forms in which it was possible to prepare the autogenous vaccine in time to be used before the graver symptoms supervened. Case 133xlviii chronic nature and undoubtedly started by gonoccccal infection, a gonococcus vaccine does practically no good. In such cases an attempt should be made to treat the secondary infection with vaccines made from the corresponding organism which, in a large number of cases is a staphylococcus albus. Opinions differ a great deal regarding the curative value of gonococcal vaccines. Whilst the results obtained from the use of these vaccines prepared at the Institute in 1910 were very promising those obtained in 1911 were quite disappointing. During the year under report a non-carbolised vaccine prepared from three freshly isolated strains was used and the reports received from different quarters seem to show that when used in small doses and with judicious care regarding the interspacing of the doses excellent results were obtained. Thus, the Fourth Physician, General Hospital, reported a case of multiple gonococcal arthritis of both knees, elbows and wrists, which resisted treatment with salicylates and iodides but readily yielded to a series of 4 injections of stock gonococcus vaccine, 3, 4, 6 and 10 million respectively given at intervals of about 5 days. Another exactly similar case of arthritis was treated with the same doses with great benefit each successive injection being followed by a fall in the temperature and subsidence of the joint pains. The experience of the Station Hospital, at Bangalore, where the vaccine was used on a fairly large scale, also was that though the vaccine did not benefit acute gonorrhxlix following such operations is due to a subsequent infection. Thus in case 113 the patient was progressing well till the fifth day after the operation, when he had a rigor followed by a rise of temperature and attended with a profuse and unhealthy looking discharge. Complete recovery followed the injection of two doses of autogenous coli vaccine 10 and 20 millions respectively. Case 951 Compared with the results obtained in other bacterial diseases it must be admitted that the vaccine treatment of chronic bronchitis and asthma has been unsuccessful on the whole. This is due to a number of causesIII TABLElii TABLE IIliii TABLE IIliv TABLE IIHalf-yearly Chemical and Bacteriological Report on the Water- Supply of the Jails in the Madras Presidency for the half- year ending 30th June 1912, being Part I of Appendix III to the Annual Report of the King Institute of Preventive Medicine, Madras, for the year 1912.

MADURA. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN2 REPORT. The water-supply of Madura continues to be of satisfactory quality, which is a notable change from past years. The water as pumped from the Infiltration Gallery is remarkably pure but even the water in the spring channels cut in the river bed is in good order. Chemically we have to note the return of the evidence of a double source of supply, as mere passage through the gallery could not produce such differences as are met with between the two samples. The water as distributed is also very fair. Chemical Analyses. SAMPLE I. SAMPLE IV. Physical appearances. Colur and Transparency. Colourless and clear. Colourless and clear. Smell. None. None.

It is satisfactory to see that the anticipations expressed by the Municipal Chairman, Tanjore, in his note of the 17th January 1912, regarding the poor resulte got with samples of Tanjore water in previous quarters, have been fully realised. The raw river water shows a moderate amount of pollution and a high total count, but the action of the re-laid filter beds is exceedingly good and a water of excellent quality is distributed to the town. Chemically also the water shows benefit from filtration in the marked reduction of organic matter. Chemical Analyses. SAMPLE 1. SAMPLE IV. Physical appearances. Colour and Transparency.

24 TIRUPATI. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN-28TH FEBRUARY 1912. REMARKS.25 SAMPLE V.26 COONOOR. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN27 REPORT. The samples on this occasion show a remarkable uniformity as regards quantity of bacterial pollution but the kind varies from the least objectionable in the Storage Reservoir to the most objectionable in the sample drawn from a tap in front of choultry near Railway Station. The kind of pollution is notably worse in the Service Reservoir than in the Storage Reservoir. The latter water may be said to be of quite good quality. The section of pipe leading to the Station should be overhauled for leaks, as it is difficult to account for the presence of the suscep- tible B. Schæfferi in any other way. The sample from the tap in front of the Post office is the best of those from the Distributary System but it shows a distinctly higher total count. Chemi- cally the superiority of the water in the Storage Reservoir over that supplied to the town is shown by the quantity and kind of organic matter present. The former shows a smaller quantity of vegetable origin, the latter a larger quantity of animal origin. Chemical Analyses. SAMPLE I. SAMPLE IV. Physical appearances. Colour and Transparency.

35 VIZAGAPATAM. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN36 REPORT. The level of the water in the reservoir is lower than usual and is of distinctly inferior quality. There are excremental germs in one-tenth of a cc. and though these are not of the most objectionable type we would expect to find only the most resistant kinds present after so long a spell of dry weather. Filtration has not improved the water; but there is a moderate improvement in the samples drawn from the more distant taps. Chemically the water shows a greatly increased amount of organic matter, and this seems to be of animal origin. Possibly this accounts for the persistence of the excremental germs of class II. A good deal of this organic matter is removed by filtration or sedimentation, but there is still too much left. Last year at this season attention was called to the remarkable rise in the amount of chlorine in the water. The rise continued during the summer quarter and reached a total of nearly thirteen parts per hundred thousand. The figure has now dropped to eleven but is still very high as compared to what it was in March 1910, viz., 1.42. A variation of this magnitude is difficult to account for. Chemical Analyses.

39 VELLORE. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN40 REPORT. The water at Vellore is not so good as it was at this time last year, and the results are not a little conflicting. The unfiltered water can be only counted as fair and, if anything, filtration has not improved it in that we see a more varied and more susceptible excremental flora in the filtered water. Sample III from a tap in Saidapet is the worst of the lot, and in the sample taken near the Cantonment Railway Station we have the curious result of an almost vanishing number of foecal germs associated with a largely-increased total count. Chemically the water shows more organic matter but it seems to be of vegetable origin. Chemical Analyses. SAMPLE I. SAMPLE III. Physical appearances. Colour and Transparency. Yellowish but clear.

47 MADRAS. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN48 REPORT. The water of the Red Hills Lake was in very good order on this occasion and it is gratify- ing to note that this condition seems characteristic of the season. Last year in April it was equally good and in 1910 though not quite so good was in fair order. These results indicate what a very valuable means of purification simple storage is, as the conservation of the gathering grounds is far from ideal and when water is running into the lake the quality is often not at all good. The only objectionable feature in the lake water is the high amount of organic matter showing the exceedingly low carbon-nitrogen ratio of three to one. The water as distributed is not nearly so good and the results got with sample III seem to point to an accumulation of silt in that section of the pipe. At Saidapet toll-gate the water is better again, though not nearly so pure as the lake water. Chemical Analysis. SAMPLE II. SAMPLE IV. Physical appearances. Colour and Transparency.

61 COONOOR. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN62 REPORT. At this season of the year it is usual to find the water in the storage reservoir showing pretty high total counts.

89 VELLORE. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN90 REPORT. Vellore water is in pretty fair order for this time of the year, the f91 MADRAS. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN92 REPORT. Bacteriologically the water at the head-works continues to be remarkably pure which shows that so far no surface water has got into the lake. Chemically it is not nearly so good, as the figures for organic matter are very high and show the undesirable carbon-nitrogen ratio of 1 to 8. It is not a little surprising to find so few organisms in a water containing so much highly nitro- genous organic matter. The water as distributed to Georgetown and at Saidapet toll-gate is very inferior and it would appear as if the pipes required to be flushed out. Both samples from the distributary system show large total counts and sixty times the number of f93 TRICHINOPOLY. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN94 REPORT. The water of a flooded river can never show any great degree of bacterial purity, but the Cauvery water on this occasion shows that the first and most objectionable kind of pollution has been washed away. Passage through the Infiltration Gallery has brought about some improvement though the total count is still very high. From this point on, the water gets steadily worse showing that the pipes must be in a dirty condition. The water of the service reservoir shows a total count of five and a half times as great as that of the water from the Infiltration Gallery, and the water drawn from a tap near the Cantonment Railway Station is ten times as bad as the flooded river water. This is a very bad state of affairs and calls for immediate action. Chemically the water as distributed is very fair. Chemical Analysis. SAMPLE I. SAMPLE IV.

Passage through the Infiltration Gallery has brought about a marked decrease in the foecal germs, but not in the total count. As filtra- tion can hardly be selective in its action, we must assume that the total count has been reduced but again augmented by deposits in the post-filtration passages. A good deal of deposition takes place in distribution and the water as drawn from the taps is very good indeed. Chemi- cally also the water as distributed is quite satisfactory. Chemical Analysis.

116 NELLORE. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN117 REPORT. A very marked deterioration is noticeable in the Nellore Water on this occasion, which there does not seem to be anything to account for. This falling off is noticeable in all the samples and it is characterised by an enormous increase in the excremental germs. These germs are perhaps not of a very objectionable kind, but their presence indicates a liability to pollution which in wetter weather might be of a dangerous nature. Curiously enough the sample taken from a stagnant pool in the river-bed shows the smallest total count of any, though chemically it is distinctly inferior. Any circumstances, that can be recognized as contributory to a state of affairs so much inferior to what was the case in June and at this season last year, should be guarded against. Chemically the water as distributed is much as usual. Chemical Analyses. SAMPLE I. SAMPLE IV. Physical appearances. Colour and Transparency. White and opaque. Colourless and clear. Smell. None. None.

As there has been a good deal more rain in Vizagapatam this year since the last examina- tion than during the corresponding period of last year, it is not surprising to find the total count very high in the tank water, but the very small ratio of germs of excremental origin to the other kinds bears witness to the gathering ground being in good order. The filters are working efficiently as is shown by the very large reduction in the total count, the disappearance of sus- pended matter and a tenfold reduction in the f122 OOTACAMUND.

133 VELLORE. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN134 REPORT. Vellore water is subject to great variations in quality and it is regrettable to note that, in the past two years at this season, the water has been much worse than in the previous three years. This is possibly due to a later onset of the rains; as on all the occasions on which the water was better, there was more water in the tank and there had been a considerably greater fall of rain since the previous analyses. The physical condition of the water, however, seems to indicate a state of flood, as the water shows a heavy sediment. Possibly only the first impure runnings were getting access to the tank and that more rain would result in better water. At such times however the necessity for adequate filtration is more than ever indicated, but the filtration at Vellore is marked by inadequacy. There is a slight improvement but nothing to what should be obtained by properly conducted sand filtration. The supply as distributed is worse again so the pipes probably require scouring out. Chemically the filtered water is fair enough but it has an objectionable colour. Chemical Analyses. SAMPLE I. SAMPLE III. Physical appearances. Colour and Transparency. Brownish and opaque.

138 TRICHINOPOLY. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN139 REPORT. The river Cauvery being in high flood, its water is, of course, very impure; but the impurity is not of a very objectionable kind as all the susceptible varieties of germs which are indicative of recent and dangerous pollution have been swept away. Still the water is a good deal worse than it was under very similar circumstances at this season last year, and unfortunately the Infiltra- tion Gallery has failed to bring about such a complete elimination of the objectionable features, so we find the filtered water this year of much the same bacterial purity as the unfiltered water last year. A farther small improvement is to be noted in the water after passing through the Service Reservoir, but this is evanescent and the water as drawn from a tap near the Cantonment Rail- way Station is worse than that at head-quarters. Probably there is some silt in this section of the pipes. Chemically the filtered water is quite good and very notable reductions in the suspended and organic matter has resulted from passage through the Infiltration Gallery. Chemical Analyses. SAMPLE I.

140 TANJORE. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN141 REPORT. The flooded river water is of course pretty impure but curiously enough the bacterial impurity is not so great this year whereas the chemical and suspended impurities are much greater. The results of filtration are remarkably good. and we find the filtered water to be of really first- class quality. The Tanjore Infiltration Gallery has worked efficiently in recent years but in this year it has surpassed all previous records. There would appear to be some silt in the pipes as there is a progressive deterioration of the water as distributed. The sample from Kurichi North Street though still pretty fair has picked up quite a surprising variety of excremental germs, and the sample drawn in the Municipal Office though it shows fewer varieties contains a greater number of such germs. Chemically the water is in a very good order-after filtration. Possibly the large amount of suspended matter in the raw river water has to do with improved efficiency of the Gallery.

155 COONOOR. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN-20TH NOVEMBER 1912. Remarks.156 REPORT. The water is not so good as it usually is at this season, but this is probably in association with the heavy rain that was falling at the time which would neutralise the good effects to be expected from sedimentation in the Bandami reservoir. The water as distributed is of much the same quality as that at the headworks, so none of the undesirable additions, probably due to the intermittency of the supply, are noted on this occasion. The service reservoir seems to be responsible for introducing a greater variety of f157 CONJEEVERAM. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN158 REPORT. The very heavy rainfall which had caused a slight flow in the river-bed is responsible for the inferior quality of the water on this occasion.

Kesava Poi, M.D. There was a marked increase in the demand for stock vaccines and the number of autoge- nous vaccines prepared was 230 against 189 of last year. The total number of doses issued was 7,087, but this included 1,060 doses of a polyvalent anti dysenteric vaccine supplied to the Lunatic Asylum for prophylactic inoculation of the inmates of the asylum during the latter part of the year. As will be seen from table I the number of doses of bacterial vaccines supplied has been over double that of last year. To facilitate reference and to be better able to have an idea of the results of bacteriological examination of different pathological conditions that came under autogenous vaccine treatment during the year, these vaccines have been grouped under the headings of different groups of diseases and a few notes appended under each.

Otitis and mastoid abscess.19 the bronchial tubes and during the course of the affection the weakened mucus membrane becomes infected with the same micro-organisms as cause the pathological changes of chroni bronchitis. It is therefore evident that vaccine treatment cannot cure true spasmodic asthma and all that it will do is to relieve the inflammatory condition and catarrh set up in the mucous membrane by the organisms that have invaded it and thereby lessen the irritation which is so apt to light up the mechanism which causes the bronchial spasm True bronchitis however stands on a quite different footing and there is no reason why, with an appropriate vaccine sufficiently persevered with, an ultimate cure should not be effected. The following is the bacteriological analysis of the 34 cases of asthma and chronic bronchitis that came under vaccine treatment during the year:20 relieved after 12 injections. She had a paroxysm a month or so after the treatment was stopped and this was also relieved by two more injections. This must certainly have been a pneumococcus infection. Another case he treated which stock pneumococcus vacoine was a complete failure, probably because the organism concerned was not the pneumococcus. The following four cases of asthma treated with autogenous vaccines may be of some interest. Case 126.21 TABLE XVI. Serial number. Case number. Medical officer. Disease. Vaccine made.

In all these cases, the rational treatment by way of vaccines would be to combine the secondary vaccine with tuberculin or else to precede tuberculin treatment with an autogenous vaccine made from the secondary organisms, Five cases of pulmonary tuberculosis were treated with such secondary vaccines of the pneumococcus and streptococcus, with improvement in three cases.

Central Jail, Salem, observed that when the vaccine was administered in the sub-acute stage of the urethritis, joint affections could be prevented, and if these did occur ankylosis did not set in. The vaccine was however of no use when the synovial membrane was thickened and ankylosis had set in. The best results were obtained by often repeated small doses slowly increased to the sub-pyrexial dose. The Officer Commanding the Station Hospital at Poonamallee from an analysis of 83 cases draws the following conclusions:26 quarter of the year with a view to study systematically the bacteriology of every case of dysentery and diarrh27 discharge from the ulcers is absent the comparative number of dysentery bacilli will naturally dwindle down still further and unless a special medium be devised to grow them to the exclusion of the other intestinal organisms-it must be almost impossible to isolate them from the stool.

It is thus seen in all stages of the disease the original method is a surer test giving the reaction in 15 to 42 per cent. of cases over and above the positive findings of the Levaditi's modification. Saline extract of dried liver powder which did not show spirochætes was tested against syphilitic sera, adopting exactly the same technique, but it was found to be quite free from the antigen or antigenlike body. About ten bloods from acute malarial fever cases in which parasites were found, were col- lected and tested It was found only three out of the ten gave positive reaction. It was not possible to collect all the bloods during febrile attack. From the history of the cases it appears that the bloods taken during the height of fever contains a little of the antigen-equivalent body. In typhoid fever negative reaction has been obtained. Specimens of blood were taken from twenty-two advanced lepers. In twelve of them, a positive reaction is obtained. A larger percentage of leprosy bloods than those of other ailments seem to give positive reaction with the test. Effect of Salvarsan on Wassermann reaction.TABLE. Number. Name.

From January 1st till February 21st Major J. W. Cornwall, I.M.S., acted as Director, after which Dr. F. M. Gibson, on return from leave, took over and continued in charge for the remainder of the year. From January 1st until November 21st Major W. S. Patton, I.M.S., continued to act as Assistant Director, but on the latter date his services were placed at the disposal of the Commander-in-Chief of the Army in India, and he reverted to military duty. On December 9th, Assistant Surgeon S. Ramakrishnan was appointed as Temporary Assistant to the Director, and was employed partly in the Vaccine and partly in the Micro-Biological Section. Water analysis.2 It will be seen that the number of bacteriological examinations has remained pretty constant for the last three years, it being, as a matter of fact, limited by the capacity of the present staff to do more than a certain number in a given time. It has to be remembered that the full detailed examinations hitherto adopted take ten3 to 16.6. This mistaken practice is a very obstinate one to get rid of. All persons employed on plague duty should be distinctly instructed that plague bacilli, except in certain moribund cases, cannot be detected microscopically in the peripheral blood. During life, films of gland juice (not peripheral blood from over the gland, but material drawn from the interior of the gland) in bubonic plague, and of sputum in suspected pneumonic plague should be sent. From dead bodies of either human beings or lower animals the films should be prepared from a freshly cut surface of the spleen or liver. Plague4 relied on as an accessory indication, some of these early cases might by suitable treatment be cured. Gonococcus.5 TABLE III6 Water for cholera-like vibrios.7 TABLE 1V.

One hundred and ninety-three auto- genous vaccines were supplied as under:8 Table VI shows the number and kinds of issues made. Since the outbreak of the war, it has been almost impossible to obtain anti-tetanic serum, all the available supplies having been bespoken by the Military Authorities in Europe. A small quantity of half strength serum was sent out by the Lister Institute, but no further supplies even of this strength, are likely to be available for some time. In these circumstances economy of existing stocks becomes very essential, and it is important to record that excellent prophylactic results have been obtained at the military hospitals in Europe with very much smaller doses than those heretofore used. Doses of 2 cc. containing 300 units have been found to give good results, and, apart from operations on accident cases, even smaller doses might be sufficient in the cases of minimal infection which alone are to be taken into account in ordinary surgical practice. As in previous years large quantities of anti-rinderpest serum and. Hæmor- raghic septicæmia vaccine have been stored and distributed on behalf of the Civil Veterinary Department. Recently also consignments of anti-anthrax serum have been received. Búildings.9 APPENDIX I. NOTES ON VACCINE THERAPY. By Civil Assistant Surgeon M.

Table I records experiments which show the difference in the total number of colonies growing in the same quantity of water on agar of different depths. 3. A small quantity of the material examined (water inoculated into melted agar) remains adherent to the test tube and may contain a variable number of organisms. To obviate this source of error it was proposed to incubate the emptied tubes also and to count any colonies which may grow thereon. At 37° C however the agar dries and shrivels up and colonies do not develop. A new method of estimating the number of organisms in a definite quantity of water, which is free from most of these fallacies, has of late been tried in this laboratory. The method consists in preparing:28 TABLE II Date of collection. Total colonies in 1 cc. of unfiltered water. Total colonies in 1 cc. of filtered water. Mixture calculated from 0.1 cc. plates.

Maitland Gibson, M.B., B.sc., Director 1 APPENDIX.REPORT ON THE WORK CARRIED OUT IN THE MICRO-BIOLOGICAL SECTION OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, GUINDY, FOR THE YEAR 1915. There were no changes in the staff during the year. Water Analysis.2 in general the lactose fermenters are much more completely eliminated than other kinds. In other words and as compared to English results the total counts are relatively high notwithstanding the fact of the lactose fermenters being satisfac- torily decreased. As the lactose fermenters are the main indication of potentially dangerous pollution, this state of affairs is a highly satisfactory one. An explanation of this is probably to be found in the interesting discovery made by Assistant Surgeon T. Sitapati Ayyar that a very large percentage, 98 per cent in fact, of the total count in sand filtered water are spore-bearing or coccal forms. It may probably be inferred from this that spore-bearing forms succeed in penetrating the filtering skin while in the comparatively small spore state, and that efficient sand filtration does as a matter of fact completely eliminate all bacillary forms. Should this find be confirmed by farther investigation with Madras and other Indian waters it will be one of first class importance, since the organisms of all water- borne disease are bacilli.

Gonorrh16 relieved. Side by side with the tuberculin treated series, one of eleven pulmonary cases was treated without tuberculin, of which one was relieved, nine died and one was discharged other- wise, none having been cured. Though from the records of these cases one could not with fairness say that the two sets of cases, namely those treated with and those without tuberculin, were strictly comparable with each other, the latter class including some advanced cases where recovery was out of question, it was quite apparent that tuberculin was of decided value as a curative, aiding in a considerable degree the action of drugs, and of dietitic and hygenic measures. It Must be stated however that under the term 'cured' are included cases where the patients had recovered from the clinical symptoms of the disease and were discharged as fit for ordinary avocations, MI these cases could not possibly be pathologically free from tubercular foci but there was no active trouble in the affected organs and no local or constitutional symptoms which could be directly attributed to the disease.

TABLE OF CONTENTS. PAGE Report on the working of the Micro-Biological Section by Dr. F. Maitland Gibson, M.B., B.SC., Director 1 APPENDIX I.REPORT ON THE WORK CARRIED OUT IN THE MICRO-BIOLOGICAL SECTION OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, GUINDY, FOR THE YEAR 1916. Up till the 11th October there were no changes in the staff. On that date the Director went on privilege leave and Major Justice, I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner for Madras, assumed charge of the Institute. On the 22nd December the Director returned from leave and was in charge for the remainder of the year. Water analysis.2 increase, in the amount of alum could bring about the desired result. This was found to be a much more promising line. With 3 grains of alum per gallon and at 50 gallons per square foot per hour there was a notable improvement in the quality of the yield from all three filters, the reduction in the total count being specially marked. The improvement was even more marked when 4 grains of alum per gallon were added, the rate of 50 gallons per hour being maintained. With five grains of alum per gallon the good quality of the yield was maintained when the flow was gradually raised from 50 to 100 gallons per square foot per hour and with 5 grains of alum finally the full rate of 100 gallons per square foot per hour was obtained ab initio with results quite as good as when the flow had been gradually raised from 50 to 100 gallons per square foot per hour. In the case of Adyar river water therefore it would seem that the amount of alum added is the controlling factor and that this amount has to be a high one. These results would need to be compared with those got elsewhere and notably in localities such as Bangalore where there is a large amount of suspended matter in the water. There, however, the raw water is comparatively good from the bacterial point of view and an elimination of the suspended matter is mainly what is aimed at and attained. Whether sufficient bacterial improvement can be got in a badly contaminated water with a reasonable addition of alum has got to be proved. The sand filters.3 TABLE I.

This contrast is even more striking when we note that the rate of filtration in the covered filter was usually higher. In no case was the rate of filtration in the uncovered ever increased beyond four vertical inches per hour which is the usual standard rate employed and on many occasions it was only 2.6 vertical inches per hour. On the other hand, rates up to 6.6 vertical inches per hour were tried with the covered filter and a rate of 77 per cent of good results was obtained. In comparison III the rate was pushed to 5.2 vertical inches per hour and 90 per cent of good results got. From this it may be argued that faster rate of filtration can safely be employed, if other conditions are satisfactory. Finally in comparison VI the filtering head in the covered filter was raised to 36 inches, 24 inches being the standard maximum. This resulted, however, in a drop in efficiency, only 38 per cent of good results being obtained; so this practice is not to be recommended. It was during comparisons IV and V that the above mentioned trouble was experienced with both filters, the percentage of good results with the covered filter falling to 43 per cent and 40 per cent and that of the uncovered filter to nil.

They were distributed to the different institutions and medical men as under:9 Very large quantities of Anti-rinderpest serum and some other bacterial products were stocked in the cold room for the Veterinary Authorities, and were distributed throughout the Presidency on indent.

The doses were, therefore, rapidly increased and after the injection of 500 million of each of the organisms a great improvement in the condition of the patient was reported. Case 97.16 Gonorrh17 and listless. Fifty million stock typhoid vaccine was injected. Two days later, he regained consciousness and asked for his food. On the 24th and 27th days, 75 and 100 million stock vaccine was injected, followed by 150 and 200 million autogenous vaccine on the 30th and 33rd days. Recovery after commencing the injections was uneventful except for a bronchitis which seemed to delay the fall of temperature to normal. In this case the first injection was unfortunately not given till the 21st day which is normally the turning point in the course of enteric. How far the vaccine favourably modified the course of the disease is thus a doubtful point. Case 15.18 A few remarks regarding the dosage of the vaccine will be of interest especially as it was once considered that high doses were not necessary or safe to administer. In the pri- mary stages of acute urethritis gonococcus vaccine should be given in very small doses. To begin with, a dose of 2½ million can be given and followed at intervals of 4 to 7 days by 5, 10, 15 and 20 carefully avoididg reactions. In spite of an apparently complete recovery after a few injections, it is quite a common experience that there is a recurrence of the dis- charge after some time either as a result of an indiscretion in diet or physical exertion. A second course of injections is given wherein a higher dose is usually reached and the dis- charge is again observed to cease. Third and even fourth relapses are common and nothing is more annoying to the physician or more disappointing to the patient than such recurrences in spite of energetic treatment. It is therefore desirable in such cases not to stop the immuni- zation until a high dose is reached, say 200 to 500 million, though it might take many weeks to do so. When the chronic stage of gleet is reached or when a case first presents itself for treatment in this stage, it is as a rule mere waste of time to administer the smaller doses. In chronic urethritis, one can safely give a comparatively high dose to start with, say 50 million and carry the patient on to 500 or even more by injecting at intervals of a week or more.

In the first place, there is a certain number of cases where the diagnosis of tuberculosis is made not by actual detection of bacilli in the sputum but by physical examination of the lungs, by the application of one or more of the tuberculin tests or by, certain signs and symptoms supposed to be characteristic of pulmonary tuberculosis. It is needless to say that unless the physician in charge has had a fairly large experience of physical examination,it is quite possible to make a wrong diagnosis unless tubercle bacilli are actually detected in the sputum. A positive Von. Pirquet's test, a strong suspicion of the presence of deposit as judged by the stethescope and percussion, a certain amount of febrile disturbance and emaciation, the occurrence of hæmoptysis, may be present individually or in combination and yet the case may not be one of tubercular disease and such being the case, it is not difficult to understand how tuberculin therapy may in certain instances win undeserved credit when the improve- ment is really due to general treatment applied to a suspected tubercular but really non-tubercular case. On the other hand the treatment may be lightly undertaken in an advanced case of real tuberculosis, in which tuberculin therapy is clearly inapplicable and certain to bring discredit to the physician and to the tuberculin treatment adopted by him. The correct estimation of the value of tuberculin therapy is therefore a matter of considerable difficulty, unless the data are perfectly controlled and the cases judiciously selected. Leaving a margin for all the errors above indicated it cannot be denied that there is a percentage of pulmonary cases that are really benefited by the treatment. The efficacy of tuberculin therapy in ostitis, arthritis, and infection of the kidneys, intestines and other organs is perhaps more indefinite than in pulmonary tuberculosis. The following case of intestinal tuberculosis is of some interest:20 APPENDIX II. A NOTE ON NOGUCHI'S MODIFICATION OF THE WASSERMANN TEST. By Civil Assistant Surgeon T. Sitapati Ayyar, L.M. & S. In the Annual Report for the year 1912, I described the technique and merits of the Original Wassermann and its modifications Hecht-Fleming and Levaditis. In the year 1914, a new modification, in which a mixture of ox-liver extract and syphilitic liver extract was used for antigen, was tried by me with very good results. A description of the method along with its advantages over others with a theoretical explanation of the Wassermann reaction was given in the annual report for the year. In the Indian Medical Gazette March number of 1916, Captain W. R. Galwey, R.A.M.C., has given an account of Noguchi's modification for which the author claims that, since all con- stituents used in the test are in known quantities, the fallacies which may occur in other methods are eliminated. I have since collected all the materials needed for the Noguchi and subjected some bloods in parallel experiments to the mixed method conducted in the laboratory as a routine, and to the Noguchi's modification as described by him.

TABLE OF CONTENTS. PAGE Report on the working of the Micro-Biological Section by Dr. F. Maitland Gibson, M.B., B.sc., Director 5 APPENDIX.5 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE MICRO-BIOLOGICAL SECTION OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, GUINDY, FOR THE YEAR 1917. Up till the 24th of June there were no changes in the staff but on that date the Director was compelled by ill-health to go on combined leave for six and a half months. Major W. A. Justice, I.M.S., was in charge of the Institute up till the 16th August, in addition to his duties as Sanitary Commissioner for Madras, when he was relieved by Dr. M. Kesava Pai, who was appointed to the position of Acting Director and who remained in charge of the Institute for the rest of the year. During the year Government was approached with a scheme for the more efficient and rapid transit of pathological and other materials between the Insti- tute and the various State Hospitals in the City. In G.O. No. 452, Medical, dated 3rd November 1917, Government sanctioned this which involved the depu- tation of a Civil Assistant Surgeon to be in charge of this work and the purchase of a specially equipped motor-car. Civil Assistant Surgeon S. Ramakrishnan, who had been assisting in the Vaccine Section, was appointed to take charge of these new duties, his place in the Vaccine Section being taken up by Civil Assist- ant Surgeon M. Gopala Ayyar on 3rd December 1917. As in previous years a very large volume of work was dealt with at the Institute. Water analysis.6 Two feet of sand is thus probably the thinnest layer which should be employed and if no more than this is used, fresh sand would need to be added after each scraping. In practice 2 feet 6 inches or even 3 feet of sand may be used so as to allow for periodical scraping but the scrapings should not be allowed to reduce the sand below 2 feet. If less than 2 feet be used, scour action seems to take place and the filtering skin, being inadequately supported, ruptures or does not form properly. Experiments were tried again this year to determine the maximum head that could be safely used with sand filters. Repeatedly successful results were got with filtering heads up to 36 inches. This is a farther proof of the strength and. reliability of the film deposited from pre-sedimented water. In 1916 when the films were deposited from unsedimented water, they always burst when heads over 24 inches were employed. The Mechanical Filters could not be experimented with this year as it was not possible to get the materials for altering them out from England.

Water samples for the detection of cholera-like vibrios showed a fivefold increase and 14 per cent showed the presence of such vibrios. Barker's Stovaine solution for spinal Anæsthesia was not in demand this year which seems a pity, as very good results were reported from its use. A new material in the shape of pessaries containing active lactic acid pro- ducing bacilli for the purpose of inhibiting infective vaginal discharges was issued in some quantity. A report on the results obtained following the use of these will be awaited with interest. TABLE III. Number. Date of despatch. Number of preg- nancy. History of former pregnancies.

It was so great that the material had to be sent out in bottles of 12 to 100 c.c. capacity instead of in the usual sealed up ampoules as our supply of glass tubing for making ampoules was threatening to run out and great delay is experienced in getting things out from England. Large increases are also seen under the headings Anti-typhoid (B. Typhosus) and Triple vaccine. The latter is a vaccine made from the organisms of typhoid and the Paratyphoid A and B fevers. The biggest relative increase is however seen under the heading of gonococcus vaccine. Polyvalent anti-gonococcus vaccine has evidently come into great favour with the authorities of the Cantonment hospitals at Bangalore, Wellington and Poonamallee. It was with considerable regret that the supplies to these Institu- tions had to be limited to a certain number per week. The reasons for this were the same as those noted under anti-cholera vaccine, with the additional one that the medium to grow this organism requires to contain a certain amount of human serum, the supply of which is strictly limited. The supply of tuberculin was farther curtailed during the year and it was made the rule not to supply private medical men and mufassal institutions with this vaccine unless a full history of each case for which the doses were required was supplied by the medical man concerned. Febrile cases and advanced cases complicated with organic disease were denied the supply as being unsuited for the treatment. There was also an increase in the number of autogenous vaccines supplied during the year to the different hospitals, civil and military, and to medical men. Details of these supplies can be seen in Tables V and VI. TABLE VI.

12 A larger number, than in previous years, of medical men from up-country stations availed themselves of autogenous vaccines by sending cultures made by themselves through the medium of the post. The success with which they made the cultivations for transmission to this Institute and administered the respective vaccines sent to them, testifies to the increasing interest evinced by them in this branch of therapeutics. Sera from the Lister Institute were stocked as usual in the refrigerating chamber and issued to hospitals and medical men. Antivenene was the only serum obtained from the Kasauli Central Research. Laboratory. On account of the war the supply of sera from the Lister Institute was irregular and now and then failed to meet the demands. To meet the surplus demand, purchases had to be made from the Bombay Agencies of Messrs. Burroughs, Wellcome & Co. and Messrs. Parke, Davis & Co. Table VII gives details of these issues which show a. falling off as compared with last year. Perhaps this may have been due to the fact that we often had to hold over the completion of an indent for a few days. TABLE VII. Number. Name of serum. Stock on hand on 1st January 1917.

A week's course of instruction in the method of manufacture, preservation and use of calf vaccine was given to candidates undergoing training for the B.S.Sc. degree and for Second-class Health Officers' diplomas. Four candidates attended the course and all of them secured pass marks in the written examination held at the end of the course. Senior Grade Civil Assistant Surgeon C. M. Tirumudiswami Pillai, L.M. & s., was on reserve duty at the Institute from 1st to 19th March 1917 previous to his being posted to the Government Lunatic Asylum. Lieutenant M. P. K. Menon, I.M.S., was, at the request of the Deputy Director of Medical Services, Ninth Division, Wellington, allowed to attend the Institute from October 1917 for instruction in the examination of bacteriological specimens. Four Assistant Surgeons were instructed in the technique of anti-plague vaccination preliminary to their being sent out on plague inoculation duty. The largely increased volume of work which was successfully pushed through in the face of difficulties reflects the greatest credit on all concerned.

The fistulæ were laid open and scraped and though they appeared to be healing, the patient developed a hectic temperature. After the second injection of five million of the autogenous streptococcus, the evening temperature fell down to normal and the ulcer began to heal up quickly. There was still a small ulcer when the report was sent, the patient having just received the sixth injection of twenty million streptococci. Pyorrh16 TABLE VI. Acne. Serial num- ber. Case num- ber.

Inflammations of the mouth, throat, nose, ear and conjunctiva.17 Cases 37 and 38 were attempts made to treat inflammatory conditions of the cornea and conjunctiva with vaccines. In case 37 there was considerable chemosis and infiltration of the cornea along with a nasal discharge from which B. septus was isolated. Treatment with the autogenous vaccine did no good whatsoever. Case 38 was one of granular ophthalmia and pannus with blepharitis of eight years' duration. There was a concomitant nasal catarrh and cultivations were made from the latter. The autogenous staphylococcus aureus vaccine was administered in doses ranging from 25 to 200 million. Considerable improvement resulted but it was not possible to say if this was due entirely to the vaccine treatment. Case 51 is an interesting case of chronic nasal ulceration of four months' duration in a medical student of the Rayapuram school. The complaint began as a nasal catarrh to which the Patient was subject from boyhood. The present trouble began with an acute cold on the subsidence of which an ulcer was noticed on the margin of the right ala nasi. This spread slowly upwards causing an excoriated appearance of the whole nasal mucous membrane. A month later the same ulceration occurred on the left side. There was chronic purulent dis- charge and occasional bleeding from the ulcers. Streptococcus and staphylococcus aureus were isolated and a combined vaccine made and injected. The discharge gradually lessened and the ulcers healed by the time 6 doses up to a maximum of 50 million streptococci were given. Case 56 was one of chronic pharyngeal catarrh of many years' duration complicated with follicular tonsilitis and Eustachian catarrh. There were very frequent exacerbations of the catarrh wherein the patient used to feel the usual malaise and hardness of hearing due to blocking of the Eustachian canal. Cultivations from the throat gave a mixed growth of pneumococcus and B. influenzæ. A combined vaccine was made and injected in doses rising up to 1,000 million of each organism. In about eight months there was considerable im- provement in the catarrhal condition and the attacks of 'cold in the head' which were very frequent had almost stopped. The patient has been advised to take an injection every month for some time longer. Asthma, chronic bronchitis and lung affections.18 TABLE VIII19 TABLE IX20 or more. This vaccine was used as a routine during an epidemic of pemphigus which broke out among the Devonshire Regiment at St. Thomas' Mount and proved remarkably effective in curing the large majority of the cases. A few who resisted the stock vaccine were success- fully dealt with by autogenous vaccines. An interesting case of acute pemphigus cured with polyvalent pemphigus streptococcus. vaccine is reported by the Superintendent of the Government Leper Hospital, Madras. A patient developed acute pemphigus with bullæ all over the body accompanied by rigors and hyperpyrexia. The mucous membrane of the mouth and pharynx was also affected. A course of two to fifteen million of the stock pemphigus vaccine promptly cured the condition. The stock compound catarrhal vaccine of the Institute made up of a number of strains. of Pneumococcus, M. Catarrhalis and B. Influenzæ was used in cases of recurring nasopha- ryngeal catarrhs and in chronic bronchitis with very encouraging results. The Civil Medical Officer of Secunderabad reports that three cases of recurring colds were successfully cured with a course of this vaccine.

REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE MICRO-BIOLOGICAL SECTION OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, GUINDY, FOR THE YEAR 1918. TABLE OF CONTENTS. Report on the working of the Micro-Biological Section by Dr. F. Maitland Gibson, M.B., B.sc., Director PAGE I APPENDIX.REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE MICRO-BIOLOGICAL SECTION OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, GUINDY, FOR THE YEAR 1918. Dr.M. Kesava Pai was in charge of the Institute till the 8th January when Dr. F. Maitland Gibson returned from leave. Dr.Gibson took over charge on the 9th January and remained in charge for the rest of the year. The motor-car sanctioned in G.O. No. 452, Medical, dated 3rd November 1917, equipped as a travelling laboratory, and designed for visiting and collecting clinical material from the State hospitals in Madras was received from the vendors on the 15th January 1918. It has proved a great success. Considerable fluctuations took place in the various kinds of examinations made and materials prepared, but the volume of work was as large as ever. Water analysis.2 The Special Committee appointed to enquire into the quality of Madras City water-supply called for the analysis of a large number of samples. The results of these analyses will be found in the report presented by the committee. Routine analysis.-Towards the end of the year the routine analyses of piped supplies and of jail supplies were resumed. To such supplies, at the instance of the Pilgrim Commission, the water supplies at important railway junctions, where large aggregations of people take place, were added. TABLE II.

Prophylactic cholera vaccine, made from locally isolated strains was at first issued in doses of 500 and 1,000 million (1st and 2nd injection) but was later sent out in doses of 1,000 and 2,000 million and is now being issued in doses of 2,000 and 4,000 million, as too severe reactions are not reported to follow these enhanced doses. These amounts may be increased in future as greater immunity will result therefrom. Anti-dysenteric vaccine for prophylactic use was supplied to the Lunatic Asylum at Calicut, the doses adopted being 500, 1,000 and 2,000 million respect- ively at intervals of 5 to 7 days. The issue of tuberculin for therapeutic use was still further lessened during the year by the exclusion of all cases not likely to benefit from the treatment. This vaccine was supplied only when the nature of the case was described in detail by the indenting officer in the usual prescribed form, febrile and debilitated cases being strictly excluded. The favourable effect of this procedure is evident from the results obtained by the use of tuberculin in the majority of cases for whom the vaccine was supplied from the Institute (vide appendix) during the year.

There was a rise in the number of these vaccines prepared, mainly due to the facilities afforded by the institute car for the free conveyance of specimens from the different hospitals of the City to the Institute. Besides the 174 cases in which vaccines were prepared, there were 83 more cases in which material was received for autogenous vaccine preparation, but no vaccine could be made because (a) the cultivations were sterile, (b) the organisms isolated were not characteristic ones or (c) the cultivations made and sent by persons especially from the mufassal were unsuccessful, due to faulty technique in inoculating the tubes. The popula- rity of bacterial vaccines with medical men in up country stations continued, the total number of autogenous vaccines made for them being 66 as against 51 in the previous year. The supply of sera from the Lister Institute was insufficient to meet the demand from hospitals and from medical men; so purchases on a large scale had to be made from the Indian Agencies of Messrs. Parke Davis & Co., and Messrs. Burroughs Wellcome & Co., at Bombay. The supply of anti-strepto cocus serum failed altogether at the end of the year, none being available at any of the above firms. On account of the cessation of the war, it ought to be possible to get regular and sufficient supplies from the Lister Institute from the early part of 1919. 3

Increasingly large quantities of veterinary sera and other products were stocked in the cold room for the Veterinary Department and issued to touring and other veterinary officers on indent. Twenty-six medical men including assistant surgeons and sub-assistant surgeons were given instruction in anti-plague inoculation. Of these seven sub- assistant surgeons were sent by the Health Officer of the Madras Corporation to undergo the training preparatory to starting an inoculation campaign in the city consequent on the outbreak of indigenous plague in Triplicane. Under G.O. Mis. No. 285, Medical, dated 18th June 1918, regular classes ex- tending over a period of one week will be held for such instruction to be given to medical men in the plague-infected districts, in batches of about a dozen at a time. The first of the series was held in December 1918 and was attended by ten assistant surgeons and sub-assistant surgeons. Mr. V. Krisnamurthi, senior lecturer of the Madras Veterinary College, was given laboratory instruction in the methods of making bacterial cultivations and preparing autogenous vaccines, to enable him to do similar work in the veterinary hospital. In this, my last Annual Report on the working of the section, I desire to call attention to and to express my satisfaction with the way in which the staff and all concerned have dealt with the increased volume of work.

On the other hand of 11 cases of urethritis, including acute and chronic cases, 2 did not benefit at all and 9 improved to a greater or less extent, relapses having occurred in a certain number of them after stopping the injections. It is interesting to note how opinions are so varied regarding the efficacy of the vaccine in the primary urethral infection. On the one hand it has been reported to have benefited or even cured cases of chronic gleet with fistulæ, in some of such cases a polyvalent staphylococcus vaccine having been used in combination with the gonococcus vaccine. On the other hand and especially by Medical Officers using the vaccine on a large scale in the venereal wards of military hos- pitals, it has been declared to be of no appreciable benefit in curing the urethritis or cutting short the natural course of the acute urethral inflammation. The vaccine was found to be effective as usual in the secondary inflammations of the prostate, epididymis, periosteum, fasciæ, conjunctiva, etc. The administration of the vaccine does not as a rule seem to be attended with reactions even when large doses are used and some of the chronic cases do in fact require the ultimate application of such large doses as 1,000 million and even more.

REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE MICRO-BIOLOGICAL SECTION OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, GUINDY, FOR THE YEAR 1919. Dr. F. Maitland Gibson, M.B., B.SC., was in charge of the Institute till the 31st March and Major J. Cunningham, I.M.S., from the 1st April to the end of the year. The report, this year, appears in a somewhat different form. The Micro- Biological section, although officially only one section, fulfils two very different functions2 in the work. Government sanctioned the scheme and work was commenced in August 1919. The training of the existing staff, who were not acquainted with the special methods necessary for manufacture on a large scale, and of the new hands occupied some time. As these became proficient, the extended manufacture of the vaccine was taken in hand and the required quantity was prepared in time to meet all the demands which were received during the past cold weather. In all 427,063 c.cs. have been made of which 35,499 c.cs. have already been issued. The remainder together with 74,650 c.cs. purchased from the Central Research Institute, Kasauli,before the output from the Institute was assured is at present in cold store ready for immediate issue should occasion demand. A considerable increase in the issue of prophylactic cholera vaccine occa- sioned by the desire of Government to encourage the use of this vaccine has also been a feature of the year. The output necessary to meet the increased demands has been rendered possible by the employment of the staff engaged in vaccine production on the manufacture of this vaccine also. 45,455 c.cs. have been supplied this year to the civil department as opposed to 352 c.cs. issued during the year 1918. Other vaccines have also been made but not on the same scale; the quantities of these issued are shown in Table II. TABLE II. Vaccines supplied in 1919. Number. Nature of vaccine.

Staphylococcus vaccine was apparently used with benefit in cases of furun- culosis, carbuncles, ischiorectal abscess, cellulitis of the foot, puerperal sepsis, empyema, etc. Streptococcus vaccine was found useful in cases of puerperal sepsis, phlegmasia dolens and erysipelas. The "pemphigus streptococcus vaccine" was used with benefit in cases of eczema and pustular eruptions. The stock acne vaccine of the Institute was reported upon favourably in a few cases. The compound catarrhal vaccine of the Institute containing pneumococcus, B. influenzæ and M. catarrhalis was found to be useful in a few cases of bronchitis. A curative influenza vaccine, containing 3 million B. influenzæ and 10 million pneumococci per c.c., was issued for trial in cases of influenza, especially those of a chronic nature. The general concensus of opinion appears to be that no appreciable benefit was derived from its use. At the Central Jail at Trichinopoly the experience gained from cases treated with the curative injections and those
3 treated by the ordinary methods only showed a percentage of 9.9 mortality among the patients treated by the ordinary methods and 8.6 per cent amongst those treated with curative vaccines. Tuberculin for curative use was issued on a small scale, but no definite benefit was reported from its use. Stock gonococcus vaccine was issued in large quantity to Civil and Military hospitals and to medical men. Opinions were unanimous with regard to its efficacy in the metastatic complications including synovitis, arthritis, orchitis, cystitis and conjunctivitis. As regards its utility in cases of urethritis there is no agreement, the majority of the cases being unfavourably reported on. Autogenous vaccines. Table III shows the nature of the autogenous vaccines made and the number or cases treated with the results obtained so far as these have been reported. There was a decrease in the number of these vaccines prepared. It will be seen from the table that in the majority of cases the results of the treatment were not reported to this office. 154 autogenous vaccines were made. All the ten cases of furunculosis were staphylococcal in origin. The 25 cases of eczema were found to be due to staphylococci or streptococci or to both of these organisms in combination. Abscesses, cellulitis, septic wounds, etc., were found to be associated with the same organisms. With the exception of one case in which B. Influenzæ was present together with the streptococcus, all the cases of Pyorrh4 TABLE IV. No. Name of serum. Stock on hand on 1st Jan. 1919. Received during the year. Sent out during the year.

This large number shows the extent to which this Institute is of assistance to the medical pro- fession in the diagnosis of different types of disease. The increase in the number of specimens received for examination year by year is evidence that this assistance is appreciated and that the value of the methods of diagnosis employed at the Institute is becoming more generally recognized. 1,939 of the total number were received from the hospitals in Madras and 1,519 came from the mufassal. It would appear that the district medical institutions could utilise the services of the Institute to a greater degree than they do at present.

No. 1006 L., dated 3rd August 1918, the systematic (half-yearly) examination of all the water-supplies in the Presidency has been recommenced at this Laboratory. This means that at least two single examin- ations from each supply are carried out every year. It must be definitely understood that these examinations merely reflect the condition of the water at the time the samples are taken and it is of course impossible from this very limited evidence to give anything like a complete report as to the potability of the various supplies. It has been the custom, however, in each case to take samples at various points along the distributary system so that information can be obtained as to the value of the various processes of purification and the condi- tion of the storage and distributing agencies. A change in the method of reporting the results of the year's work has also been introduced. A general survey of the condition of the various water-supplies, as far as this can be deduced from the examination of the samples which have been taken from each, is given and the details of the examinations which are, as a rule, only of interest to those actually performing the analyses have been omitted. This part of the report is dealt with in three sections according to the origin of samples:8 (a) Municipalities. The waters-upplies to municipalities in the Madras Presidency are derived from one of three sources (i) Rivers, (ii) Lakes and reservoirs, (iii) Springs and wells, and in most cases undergo some type of preliminary treatment prior to delivery to the consumer. (i)Rivers.9 Samalkotah junction is supplied from a deep sub-artesian bore-hole. The quality of the water is good but at the last examination it showed signs of deterioration as a result of flooding. The other stations obtain their supplies from wells. The quality of water from these varies very considerably. (Vide Appendix III.) (3) Research work in connection with the Experimental Filter Installation. Research work was continued with the Experimental Filters during the year. (a) Sand filters.10 filtration exerts a beneficial effect. Five days as a rule is sufficient to yield good results. It must be understood that the results of these experiments refer only to the general decrease in the number of water bacteria. They do not necessarily bear any relation to the length of time required to render a water infected with pathogenic organisms safe for drinking purposes without the further process of filtration. The storage for five days advocated in the foregoing paragraph must be regarded merely as a preliminary to filtration. (c) Mechanical filters.11 APPENDIX I.

REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE MICRO-BIOLOGICAL SECTION OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, GUINDY, FOR THE YEAR 1920. TABLE OF CONTENTS. (1) Part I.REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE MICRO-BIOLOGICAL SECTION OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, GUINDY, FOR THE YEAR 1920. Major J. Cunningham, I.M.S., was in charge of the Institute till the 7th March 1920, Major Wright, I.M.S., from 8th March to 30th April 1920, and M.R.Ry. Rao Bahadur M. Kesava Pai Avargal, M.D., from 1st May 1920 to the end of the year. The report of this year has been drawn up in the same form as was adopted for 1919, part I dealing with the bacteriological diagnosis and treatment of disease and part II with the examination of water-supplies and all other subjects connected with the public health. PART I. (1) The Preparation and Supply of Bacterial Vaccines. The number and doses of autogenous and other bacterial vaccines issued during the last five years are shown in Table I. TABLE I. Statement showing the number of doses of bacterial vaccines prepared and issued during the last five years. Number of doses sent out. 1916. 1917. 1918. 1919. 1920.

The various medical officers who indented for the vaccine on a large scale late in 1919 apparently used up their supplies early in 1920, so that the demand for the vaccine in the latter half of the year was very limited. Cholera moreover prevailed to a much less extent in 1920 than in 1919, but seems to be showing signs of its appearance in epidemic form in many localities in January 1921. It is very likely, therefore, that the prophylactic vaccine will be requisitioned on a large scale in 1921. The demand for prophylactic influenza vaccine was larger during the year than in 1919, though the epidemic was milder. The figures received from different parts of Southern India, including jails and other institutions, of the prophylactic value of the vaccine against influenza, showed that though there was no apparent decrease in the incidence of the disease, there was an appreciable lessening of the mortality and the pulmonary complications. (Vide Table II.) TABLE II. 2 The absence of any decisive prophylactic effect on the incidence of the disease may possibly have been due to the inadequacy of the dose of the B.Influenzæ in the vaccine. Under instructions from the Director-General, Indian Medical Service, Simla, the composition of the vaccine was changed from 60 millions of B. Influenzæ and 200 million Pneumococcus to 400 million B. Influenzæ and 200 million Pneumococcus in 1 c.c. of the vaccine. Under G.O. No. 147 L., Mis., dated 19th February 1920, a little over half the number of the temporary staff employed for six months for the manufacture of prophylactic influenza vaccine since August 1919 has been continued for a further period of twelve months ending 15th February 1921. Considering the useful work turned out by this section of the staff and the necessity of continuing the prepara- tion of prophylactic influenza and cholera vaccines during the coming year to meet the needs of the presidency in view of the probable recrudescence of influenza in 1921 and a threatening of cholera in epidemic form in the spring of the coming year, Government have been moved for the sanction of the continuance of part of the present temporary staff for a further period of twelve months commencing from the 16th February 1921. Of the other stock vaccines, Gonococcus and Staphylococcus continued to be popular as in previous years and were favourably reported upon by the different medical offcers, who indented for them. The number and doses of bacterial vaccines issued during the year is given in Table III. TABLE III. Vaccines supplied in 1920. Number. Nature of vaccine. Number of doses of autogenous vaccine.

Autogenous vaccines were prepared for 280 cases, the largest number prepared during any one year, ever since this branch of work was commenced at the Insti- tute in 1911. The majority of these vaccines were made, as in previous years, for diseases of the skin including furunculosis, eczematous affections, abscesses, carbuncles and cellulitis; respiratory diseases including catarrh of the nose, throat, ear and bronchi; and genito-urinary affections, including urethritis, cystitis pyelitis and bacilluria. The large amount of time and labour involved in the preparation of these autogenous vaccines was not, however, compensated by the results obtained, for the results of the treatment could not be obtained in even 50 per cent of the cases for which the vaccines were prepared and issued. The reason for this failure to receive reports of results in the majority of cases, apparently lies in the fact that hospital patients for whom these vaccines were mostly made did not persevere sufficiently long with the injections and obtained their discharge, before the vaccines could possibly produce their decisive effect. In
3 some instances, the patients had already been discharged from hospital, when the autogenous vaccine was made available for their use. Bacterial vaccines are, as a rule, resorted to When ordinary medical treatment fails and patients must realize that vaccines, even when they prove effective, take time to act and cannot work with any marvellous rapidity. In all cases it is therefore desirable that medical men should use their discretion in the choice of cases, confining themselves to such affections as are likely to yield to vaccines and such persons as are likely to persevere with their use. A list of autogenous vaccines made during the year is given in Table IV. TABLE IV. Autogenous vaccines made in the year 1920. Class of cases. Number of vaccines made. Result. Cured. Improved.

Table II shows the number of water samples examined at the Institute during the year under report. Two new supplies were included in the programme of routine periodical examinations of the year, viz., those of Rameswaram and of Tuticorin. TABLE II. Nature of examination.

Such a detailed examination facilitated the detection and location of defects which could be remedied by the authorities concerned and the result of the remedy applied, could be estimated during the succeeding analysis. Municipal water-supplies.8 was laid and brought into operation during the year, to augment the supply from the existing gallery at Arapoliem. The new gallery was found to yield a water definitely superior in quality to the old one. Of the ten municipalities which use sand filters, Periyakulam, which, during the last year, headed the list with a uniformly good record has lost its place and fared badly this year. The Madras Corporation sand filters have given the most satisfactory results of all the sand filter installations in the Presidency. Cocanada, which promised to do well during the first two examinations in 1919, was found, at the end of the year, to have fallen below the mark and has not since been able to rise to the original level of efficiency. At Adoni, Salem and Ellore, no benefit has been derived from the process of sand filtration. The sand filters in the other municipalities have given indifferent or poor results. Of the three towns which employ mechanical filters, the proper dosage of alum, on which the success of this system of purification largely depends has been lost sight of and doses considerably short of the optimum have been employed with disappointing results. The filter beds committee appointed in. G.O. No. 1042 W., dated 21st May 1914, inspected Chidambaram water-works in February 1920. They found that in the pressure mechanical filter there, the dose of alum used was minute and absolutely insufficient, with the result that the raw water passed through and out of the filter almost unchanged. The three hill stations supplies were found to be in good order at the first examination, though samples drawn immediately after the first heavy rains, showed some signs of deterioration. Such of the municipalities as depend wholly or in part on wells and springs yielded very variable results. Kumbakonam, which derives its supply from a very deep sub-artesian borehole, showed as usual, a high and uniform standard of bacterial purity at the first examination, but the second examination conducted in December last showed evidence of a slight deterioration in quality. The unusually heavy and incessant rains in the Tanjore district during October and November 1920, evidently accounted for this deterioration. Jail supplies.9 The results obtained have been set forth in Tables III and IV below: 10 Table III contains details as to the lines of experiments, the strengths of the solutions, and results of titration for the percentage of available chlorine in the solutions (a) soon after they were made, (b) a week later, and (c) 16 days later. It will be seen that a 10 per cent solution keeps better after 16 days and loses compa- ratively smaller quantities of the chlorine than solutions of higher strengths. Lower strengths are not to be preferred, from the point of view of bulk. TABLE IV. Results of Bacteriological Examination. Sample. Lactose fermenters in ? c.c. Total count.

Table IV gives the results of the bacteriological examination of untreated Adyar water and the same treated with the proper dosage of the above solution 16 days' old. The proper dosage was determined by the field-test advocated by Prof. Sims Woodhead. The bactericidal power of the stored solution was thus found to have been maintained unimpaired. From these experiments the following conclusions are justifiable:11 The Filter Beds Committee appointed by Government in G.O. No. 1012 W., dated 21st May 1914, under whose direction experiments are being conducted met in February and Major Morison, I.M.S., was invited to offer his suggestions to the Committee. He laid stress upon the value of chlorine solutions in the purifica- tion of highly polluted water-supplies. On the question of standards for drinking water in the tropics, he was of opinion that the conditions and surroundings which affect the purity of natural water supplies in India were so unsatisfactory and liable to such wide variations that it was not safe to place great reliance on existing methods of water purification by filtration alone, much less to attempt to fix any standard short of absolute freedom from bacteria of any sort. He was, therefore, in favour of chlorination being adopted as a routine measure in addition to filtration. The Committee accordingly resolved to obtain sanction of Government for installing a chlorination plant at Guindy or at Kilpauk, with a view to carry out some experiments preliminary to adopting the system for the mufassal supplies. As regards the Experimental Filter Installation at Guindy, it was resolved to restrict the experiments to definite points raised by the Engineers for solution as a result of their experiences in the working of mufassal water-supply installations. Mechanical Filters.12 The Special Engineer of the Madras Corporation who has been planning out experiments with a chlorination plant at Kilpauk suggested to the Committee that, as a preliminary to those experiments, the sand filters at Guindy may be worked with layers of flat tiles and a reduced layer of sand at a very rapid rate with a view to find out the extent of purification and improvement in physical appear- ance effected thereby. Two sets of experiments were conducted and it was found that, working at a very rapid rate, although the slow sand filter standard was not reached, the water did improve in quality and in physical appearance to a slight extent. Further experiments on these lines are now being conducted to get at more definite conclusions. The Filter Beds Committee have come to the conclusion that the time has now come when, as a result of the experience gained from the working of the Experimental Filters, it is desirable to set up an Inspectorate of trained men who would visit the mufassal filters, carry out experiments and advise the executive on the spot. They have accordingly formulated and sent up their recommendations to Government on the subject and orders are being awaited. I have great pleasure in placing on record the assistance given as usual, by the Sanitary Engineer and his staff at the Guindy Experimental Filters where the above work was conducted, and the loyal co-operation of the staff of the Institute in carrying out such a large volume of work in all the sections.

The addition of citrate was found to interfere with the growth of the parasite and had an inhibitive effect in the proportion in which it was used. A small quantity of sodium citrate in solution has, however, to be used in drawing the blood, to prevent it from clotting. (2) The presence in the culture tubes of an adequate quantity of condensation fluid, is an essential factor in the successful cultivation of these flagellates. It was often found necessary to ensure a sufficient quantity of this fluid, by having recourse to the simple means of decanting out the contents of two or more tubes into one, with strict precautions against contamination. (3) The growth of these parasites takes place only when a constant temperature of 22°C. is successfully maintained, even a slight rise above this point affecting the growth adversely. Difficulties were experienced in maintaining a constant temperature with the Hearson's cool incubator that was used here. The temperature was fluctuating as a result of (a) the water used in the feeding tanks becoming warm and passing in that condition through the ice jacket and (b) saw dust getting in and blocking the pores of the ice tank. These two difficulties were overcome (1) by storing water for the feeding tanks for about 12 hours previously in the cool room of the Refrigerator and (2) by providing a cylindrical funnel with wire gauze screen to the ice tank of the cold incubator. (4) The next point relates to the technique of cultivation. Peripheral blood contains the parasite in such small numbers that in attempting to grow them on artificial media with a small amount of condensation fluid, great care has to be taken in inoculating just enough blood into the tubes which would on the one hand contain at least one parasite and on the the other would not unduly dilute the condensation fluid. From some experiments conducted with suitable controls, it would appear that the centrifugalising of about a c.c. of blood would help to get over this difficulty, inasmuch as the deposit can be relied upon to ensure a satisfactory culture and avoid errors on the side of too much or too little of blood. (5) Once the parasite is obtained in culture on N.N.N. medium, it is comparatively easy to carry it on through several generations; and during these transfers slight variations in the technique, composition of the media and temperature do not seem to exert any deleterious effect on its vitality. They do not however grow at all on any other media. (6) As the N.N.N. culture tubes inoculated with the patients' blood have to be incubated for a fairly long time, and subjected to periodical examinations it becomes necessary to guard against their contamination with spores and other organisms and against evaporation of the condensation fluid so essential for their growth. This, in practice, is best achieved by soaking the cotton wool plugs in hot melted paraffin before plugging the tubes and by providing rubber caps on top of the cotton wool plugs. Judging from the results of the examination of this limited number of cases, although it might be hazardous to definitely contradict the findings of other workers on peripheral blood cultivations, it can be stated that this method cannot replace the liver and spleen puncture methods which are of more certain diagnostic value. If, however, the factors governing the egress of the parasites into the peripheral blood at stated times or after certain provocative treatment, are definitely established, then the peripheral blood cultivations will mark a definite step in the direction of advance in our knowledge of Kala Azar.
