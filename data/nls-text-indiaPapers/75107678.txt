IP/32/HG. S. REPORT ON THE LOCK HOSPITALS IN THE PUNJAB FOR THE YEAR 1887. Published by Authority. PriceREPORT ON THE LOCK HOSPITALS IN THE PUNJAB FOR THE YEAR 1887. Published in Authortin PriceProceedings of the Hon'ble the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in the Home (Medical and Sanitary) Department, No. 340, dated 21st July 1888. READ( 2 ) priety, and the Lieutenant-Governor wishes to repeat the observation made in paragraph 3 of this Government&#39;s Proceedings in the Home Department for November 1857, No. 11 A., to the effect that he declines to countenance any such action, and altogether disapproves of officers under his control taking part in such proceedings. 6. The suggestion of the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals that matters relating to venereal disease among the troops and the Lock Hospital Reports should in future be dealt with entirely by the Military authorities cannot be carried out so long as it is the wish of the Government of India that the Civil authorities should co-operate with the Military authorities in the matter. ORDER.No. 2066, dated 28th June 1888. From( 2) but the difficulties of prevention in hill stations are very great; in fact it is difficult to see how such illicit intercourse can be prevented short of considerably curtailing the liberty of the soldier. The levy of fines was freely resorted to in 1887, when a total sum of Rs. 649-4-0 was realized in nine cantonments. The sum of Rs. 232-12-0 realized at Mooltan is high. With the single exception again of Dalhousie, the accommodation is re- ported to be ample. I have again to draw attention to the delay and carelessness with which reports are submitted to me. They are seldom correct or compiled in accord- ance with standing orders; and having to return them, often more than once, throws much additional work on my office at the busiest time of the year. Little, if any, notice has been taken of your letter No. 158, dated 6th April 1887, addressed to Secretaries of Cantonment Committees. It is a matter for considera- tion whether the time has not now arrived for transferring this matter entirely to the Military authorities, who exercise far greater control over these hospitals than the Civil Department does or can be expected to do. Punjab Government Press, LahoreNo, 22, dated 12th January 1888. From( 2 ) In January and February the Lock Hospital was not started, the first examination being towards the end of March. During these three months there were 66 admissions, leaving only 102 admissions for the rest of the year. During the first six months of the year there were 118 admissions ; dur- ing the latter six months 50. Out of this 50, 3 cases were in. 8-1 Battery and contracted at Deolali, leaving 47 cases contracted in Delhi. In October there were no cases of venereal in the Station Hospital. Sub-committee.

Gonorrh( 5 ) Punjab Government Press, Lahore.No.1370/S.S O. dated Subáthu, 20th February 1888. From( 2 ) Medical Officer and Officer Commanding. On a report from the former a village called Kumarhuttie was placed out of bounds. The admission for venereal diseases amongst the troops was owing prin- cipally to the fact that the Cantonment is bounded on every side by indepen- dent Native States over which the Cantonment authorities have no jurisdiction. The consequence is that a number of women in the neighbouring villages carry on prostitution without fear of molestation, and it is known that very many of them are diseased. In June last the Quartermaster-General in India invited the attention of the Military authorities to Punjab Government Notification No. 817, dated 7th October 1870, in which it is laid down that the Cantonment authorities have juris- diction regarding prostitution within a radius of four miles of Cantonments. This apparently, at the commencement of the year, was not known by the Civil and Military authorities. The Deputy Inspector of Police was at once sent for by the Officer Commanding the Station, and orders were given to the Police to exercise supervision and bring in prostitutes for inspection if found practising their calling within the radius stated, but, as a matter of fact, not one was so brought in. This from what I can learn I attribute to the ruling of the law, viz., that a woman cannot be apprehended unless caught in the act. The Deputy Inspector of Police has informed me that he is aware of women living in the vicinity of the station, viz , at Kumarhuttie-Kukurhuttie, on the Solon road, and near the soldiers' gardens, who carry on prostitution with the troops, but his constables cannot arrest them on suspicion or bonâ fide information received for the reason above stated. I believe during the season of 1886 some women were apprehended by the Police, brought up for inspection, and found diseased ; but, as they would not regis- ter their names, were turned out of Cantonment limits, where they actually lived and probably practised their calling with impunity. This action of the Police, I believe, was made the subject of a report by the women in question to the Commissioner at Simla, who, I am told, ruled that it was illegal ; that they had no authority to apprehend women on suspicion, and cautioned them to be more particular for the future. From this it will be seen how ambiguous the authority is regarding the control of prostitution by unlicensed women within a radius of four miles of Cantonment limits. If what I have written in the above paragraph is correct, it will be seen how handicapped the Police are, and how difficult the duty is that they are expected to perform, besides the risk they would incur in arresting a woman within the ruling of the law. The risk I allude to is the obvious action a soldier would take under the circumstance if interfered with.

From(2) prostitutes and are some of them living within the limits of Cantonments, whilst others live in the surrounding villages. There is again nothing to prevent a soldier from visiting the city bazár where prostitution is carried out, and he may contract disease there. Only one case of illegal prostitution has been brought to my notice since I have had medical charge of the hospital, and this single instance has been reported to the Cantonment Magistrate, but I can throw no light upon the final result of my report since I have heard nothing further regarding the woman (a milk-Woman). The weekly venereal returns have been regularly received.

From(2) It is thus evident that there has been a gradual and important im- provement in the health of the troops in this point. Moreover, a very con- siderable amount of the ineffectiveness shown has not been due to disease con- tracted from the licensed prostitutes. A number of cases are secondary, some are re-admissions for previous disease, and there is no doubt that a large number have been due to illicit intercourse with unlicensed women. In by far the majority of cased in which registered women have been reported by soldiers as having communicated disease to them they have been found quite healthy on examination.

From( 2 ) In addition to the above there were 31 cases of venereal disease trans- ferred from other hospitals during the year. The large number of admissions shown in January and February were apparently due to the arrival in the former month of a large draft from Eng- land, and the increase in April may also be traced to the arrival of a detach- ment from Fort Attock. Of the 15 cases admitted in December, 13 occurred amongst the Royal Irish and came to hospital subsequent to the 26th of the month, the date on which that regiment arrived in Naushahra. By inquiry made at the time from each soldier it was ascertained that out of the total number of admissions for venereal disease, viz., 64, the disease had been contracted in Naushahra in only 34 instances( 3 ) Annual Statement No. I. of the Lock Hospital at Naushahra for the year 1887. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Local Govern- ment or Ad- ministration.

The Lieutenant-Governor will await the views of the Govern- ment of India in regard to this matter and will, if it is so considered necessary, call for intermediate returns showing the attendance of women at Lock Hospi- tals during the first half of the current year. 6. The question of the submission of Lock Hospital Reports in future will of course depend on the decision which may be arrived at in regard to the continued maintenance of these institutions. ORDER.No. 32 S., dated 13th June 1889. From-B. GRAY, Esquire, Officiating Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab, To-The Secretary to Government, Punjab. WITH reference to your letter No. 250, dated 8th May 1889, I have the honor to return the two copies of the Lock Hospital Report for 1888, and. to make the following remarks. 2. I append the usual table showing the admissions among the troops into hospital for venereal disease and the average strength of troops at each cantonment during the years 1887 and 1888 :- Hospital.

( 2 ) 3. It will be observed from these figures that nine of the Sixteen cantonments show an increase of disease among the troops. The increase is very marked in Delhi, Umballa, Jullundur, Ferozepore, Meean Meer and Mooltan. Although not so marked in the other three, the increase is still con- siderable. 4. The orders abolishing the compulsory registration and examination of prostitutes took effect from 1st September 1888, and from the special reports it will be seen that, where an increase of venereal disease took place among the troops during the year under report, the cause is generally attributed by Medical Officers in charge of Look Hospital to the introduction of the new system Statistics showing the prevalence of venereal disease; month by month unfortunately are not given in all the reports, but in cases where they are given, they appear to bear out in a very marked manner the opinion that the cessa- tion of the compulsory registration and compulsory examination of prostitutes has been the cause of the increased prevalence of venereal disease among the European troops. Thus in the Delhi Cantonments the number of admissions into hospital during the last three months exceeded the total number of admis- sions during the rest of the year; in Jullundur the admissions during the first nine months was 182, in the last three 285 ; in Ferozepore the average number of admissions in the first eight months was between 4 and 5, in the last four months 14 to 15 ; in Mooltan during the first nine months the admissions were 133, during the rest of the year 315. At Umballa the increase is ascribed partly to the larger number of cases imported by troops coming from Burma and partly to the recent orders of Government regarding contagious diseases. 5. There was a decrease of venereal disease among European troops in seven cantonments, and it is worthy of remark that five of these were hill stations, viz., Dagshai, Kasauli, Sabáthu, Dalhousie and Murree ; the other two being Attock and Pesháwar. The only cantonment in which there was a very marked decrease was that of Sabáthu, where the ratio per mille of admis- sions to average strength fell from 452.48 in 1887 to 177.11 in 1888. No indication is given in the Sabáthu report as to the probable cause of the decrease; nor is any allusion whatever made to the effect that was produced on the prevalence of venereal disease by the abolition of the compulsory registra- tion and examination of prostitutes. It will be observed that in all the other cantonments in which there was a decrease of venereal disease in 1888 as compared with the previous year, the decrease was small. At Kasauli, although there was a slight decrease during the year, the Medical Officer reports that the admissions nearly doubled during the last quarter( 3 ) 7. It will be seen also from Statement II attached to each report that during the last quartet very few diseased women applied to be admitted into Lock Hospitals for treatment. During the last quarter a reduction was made in the establishment of some of the hospitals. I have very little doubt that if prostitutes are not induced to present themselves for examination and for treatment when they are diseased, by means which may not be termed compulsory but are virtually so, the number that will be examined and treated will in all cases be exceedingly small. If therefore the system introduced in September last is to be continued, Lock Hospitals generally may, in my opinion be closed ; thus relieving Government and Cantonment Funds of a considerable outlay. 8. Although the compulsory system was abolished on the 1st Septem- ber, its effect on the prevalence of venereal disease would undoubtedly not cease all at onceCopy of letter No. 14, dated 14th-January 1889, from the Officer Commanding at Delhi, to the Deputy Com- missioner, Delhi District. I HAVE the honour to forward annual Lock Hospital report for 1888, together with an extract from proceedings of the Cantonment Committee, assembled at Delhi on the 12th instant, on the subject. No. 25, dated the 18th January 1889. From( 2 ) Table showing Venereal Disease amongst European Troops in Delhi. MONTHS. Ulcer of Penis. Gonorrh3 Weekly returns from Station Hospital and vene- real disease among Euro- pean soldiers. (I). The weekly venereal returns from the Station Hospital, showing the number of admissions of soldiers for venereal disease, have been regularly received, and they are very instructive. In the final column of foregoing table, I have carefully eliminated all cases contracted on the line of march into Delhi, and in other stations. Looking at this column, I do not think one could require a more com- plete illustration of the great benefit of the Contagious Diseases Act. The latter was in force until the end of August, and its good effects would, in all pro- bability, continue to a certain extent through the following month of September. For eight Months of the year, then, we can say that the European soldier was fully protected by the Act, and in the ninth month partly protected, and in the three final months of the year he was unprotected. The number of men diseased in these three únprotected months exceeds the whole number diseased in the nine protected months ; or, in other words, the admissions, month for month on an average, are three times greater in an un- protected than a protected month. Comparative amount of venereal disease in this and past year. (II).4 placed upon the register and compelled to attend once a week (Mondays) at the Lock Hospital, when a careful inspection was made of each. Each. woman was furnished with a ticket, which was signed at each inspection, and the date written and initialled. When a soldier came to Hospital with venereal, he was sent, in company with the Lock Hospital chaprássi, to the house where he contracted it, and there pointed out the woman to the chaprássi. She was then called upon to attend immediately at the Hospital for examination. If diseased she was detained till cured. Should her name not be upon the register, and she refused to attend for examination, the fact was brought to the notice of the Honorary Assistant Commissioner, with a view of her being re- gistered without delay. Area of registration. F.5 There were 76 admissions for venereal disease into the Lock: Hospital during the first eight months of 1888, against 123 during the ten months of 1887 during which the Contagious Diseases Act was in force. This gives an average for 1888 of 9.5 admissions per month of enforced inspection against 12.3 admissions per month of enforced inspection in 1887. This is a marked improvement in the health of the prostitutes, especially when it is remembered that there was a larger average number of prostitutes on the register in 1888 than in 1887 during the months of enforced attendance. Turn- ing to detail, we find that the most serious illness, primary syphilis, has most markedly decreased ; only seven cases occurring through the year, as contrasted with 29 in 1887. There was one case of secondary syphilis in 1887 and in 1888.

No. 392, dated 26th February 1889. From2 was rather attractive in personal appearance. As is usually the case, in a very large percentage of the cases in which licensed women were reported by soldiers for having communicated disease to them, medical inspection showed the accusa- tion to be false. The weekly returns of admissions into Hospital for venereal disease. amongst British troops have been regularly received and noted. Lock Hospital Sub- Committee. D.3 All examinations have been made personally by the Medical Officer himself with due care and delicacy, and no woman has objected to the operation. Any women found suffering from disease of any kind is admitted into Hospital for treatment, the women of the city being treated together with the canton- ment women. Every admission and discharge has been made on the Medical Officer's authority after careful personal examination. The dhais have been most useful in summoning the women for examinations, which have been made at uncertain times and without previous notice, in order that, as far as possible, the women might be prevented from trying to conceal disease by the use of astringents, &c. The dhais also give information as to the cause of non- attendance at the examinations. The surgical instruments and appliances are in accordance with regula- tions, and are sufficient for diagnostic purposes, but a few additional uterine instruments would be of service for treatment. In accordance with instructions received from the Quarter Master General, no periodical examinations have been held since 31st August. When reported by soldiers as being diseased the women willingly come to Hospital for examina- tion and treatment. Disease amongst the women. J.4 them, and are consequently more liable to seek unlicensed women nearer their barracks ; and thirdly, the men are further removed from regimental authority and more likely, to be supplied with liquor.

Proceedings of the Honble the Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab, in the Home (Medical and Sanitary) Depart- ment, No. 385, dated 7th July 1890. READ( 2 ) The extraordinary increase in Siálkot seems to call for special inquiry to elicit the cause and to ascertain whether it may not be partly due to some change of system in admissions. Dr. Farrell is of opinion that though the expenditure on the hospitals has been greatly reduced they are not worth even their present cost on the voluntary system. As the voluntary attendance in some hospitals is considerable the Lieutenant-Governor would be sorry to see them abolished without a further trial. 4. In conclusion, the Lieutenant-Governor notices that the orders for the formation of Sub-Committees to manage the Lock Hospitals have not been observed in every Cantonment. At Dagshai and Subáthu there were Sub-Committees for part of the year only, probably because these stations are denuded of troops in the winter months. At Kasauli and Solon there were no Sub-Committees at all. The Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals will be asked to ascertain and report the reasons for the omission to comply with the orders on this subject. ORDER.No. 1823, dated 13th May 1890. From( 2 ) at Attock are satisfactory, and results seem to bear this out. The figures in Table 2 of the Attock Report show that something is done as regards the examination and treatment of prostitutes, whom the Medical Officer reports as willingly submitting to What is required. There is little difference in the working of the Lock Hospital last year and in 1887, when the Acts were in force. Attock is perhaps too small a station for its statistics to be of much value. Both Nowshera and Pesháwar show a satisfactory diminution in the admission rate. At the former place the Medical Officer is quite satisfied with the working of the Lock Hospital, which means, I take it, that this class of women voluntarily submitted to much the same measures last year as they were compelled to adopt when the Acts were in force, and the figures in Table II of this report for both years show this to be the Case. At Peshawar the Medical Officer reports that since the abolition of the Acts venereal disease has markedly increased, but his statistics do not show this. On the contrary, they show that venereal was far more prevalent in 1887, when the Acts were in force, than in 1889, when they were not in force. The ratio of admissions for the last three years are( 3 ) effectives from this one cause in 50,000 Men. Whatever may be thought of compulsory measures, they had at all events the merit of keeping venereal disease under some sort of control, but there is actually nothing in the pre- sent system to check its growth. 7. Referring to Table II, I have made a comparison between the admis- sion rate in 1887, when the Acts were in force, and in 1889, when the voluntary system was worked. I have also tabulated the working of the Lock Hospitals in both years. These figures show that in 1887 the admission rate for venereal disease among British troops was 261 per 1,000. There were also 2,243 admissions of registered women to Lock Hospitals and an average of 122 Women under treatment at 16 stations. In 1889 the admission rate for British troops was 391 per 1,000. The admissions to Lock Hospitals numbered 252, and the average number of women under treatment at all stations was about 16. These figures show, I think, conclusively that these women do not resort to Lock Hospitals worked on the voluntary system, and that these institutions are of no use at all in checking the spread of venereal disease. The conflicting results of their working is a further proof of their inefficiency. At some stations they seem to produce fair results as regards the prevalence of disease, as at Nowshera. At others the same working has no results whatever in this way as at Subáthu. At Pesháwar and Ferozepore venereal disease is not very prevalent, yet the Lock Hospitals are not worked at either place. I do not see the use of maintaining a system of this kind, which has now been tried for More than a year, and I have no hesitation in recommending the abolition of Lock Hospitals if no change can be made in the present system of working them. 8. Table III shows the expenditure incurred in working Lock Hospitals in 1887 and 1889. There has been a very large reduction of expenditure last year, mainly owing to these hospitals having been placed in medical charge of officers of the Subordinate Medical Department instead of Commissioned Medical Officers, who were formerly in charge,( 4 ) TABLE No. I.

No. 103, dated 28th January 1890. From2 Number and character of admissions amongst British troops. 2. The number and character of the admissions for the diseases is specified below on " an average strength of 1,994 " for the past year. It is given in a tabular form:3 varieties of diseases most prevalent amongst them. The voluntary system has been in force throughout the year:4 (4). If a woman is suffering from venereal disease, or is suspected of having propagated disease to any soldier, she should be asked to present herself for examination, and, if necessary, for treatment, at the Lock Hospital. Should she refuse a report is to be made to the Cantonment Magistrate with a view of the woman being turned out of Cantonments. (5). In the event of a woman returning to Cantonments without autho- rity, or practising prostitution stealthily, she should be fined or incarcerated in jail, as the Magistrate may deem expedient. (6). All soldiers admitted to hospital for venereal disease should be asked to point out the prostitute who infected them. (7). A registration fee should be charged for all prostitutes residing within Cantonments, and dháís entertained at the various chaklas to report on the diseased condition of the women under their care. (8). No woman is to be registered unless she is willing to have herself medically examined periodically. UMBALLA : The 2nd January 1890. JNO. NAZARETH, ASST.

A.2 The number of admissions per thousand of strength is slightly below that of last year: this may be accounted for in a small degree by the fact that the 2nd Battalion Royal Warwick. Regiment did not arrive in the station till February last. The number returned under the head of primary syphilis includes the disease now returned as 606 ulcer of penis, the disease being of a venereal origin but not giving rise to constitutional symptoms. The weekly returns of venereal diseases amongst the European troops have been received regularly through the Cantonment Magistrate, D.3 Annual Statement No. I of the Lock Hospital at Mooltan for the year 1889. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Local Govern- ment or Admin- istration.

No. 129. FROM H. MAUDE, ESQUIRE, Offg. Junior Secretary to Government, Punjab and its Dependencies, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, HOME DEPARTMENT. Dated Lahore, 13th March 1891. Home. Medical and Sanitary. SIR, I AM directed to forward, for the information of the Government of India, the annual returns of the Voluntary Venereal Hospitals due from the Military Cantonments in the Punjab for the year 1890. A copy of a letter from the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, No. 647, dated the 5th of March 1891, sub- mitting remarks on the returns, is also enclosed. Sir James Lyall agrees with Dr. Farrell that it is too early to form any definite conclusions as to the value of the new system for the prevention of propagation of venereal disease, and considers that a further trial is necessary to allow of any definite conclusion being arrived at on this point. The Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals has been asked to obtain an explanation of the reason why a sum Rs. 486-8 was incurred at Delhi under the head No. 647, dated 5th March 1891.
